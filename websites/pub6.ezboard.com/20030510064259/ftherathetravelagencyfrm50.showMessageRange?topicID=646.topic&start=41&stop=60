So what happens when and if there is a rule that says you cannot team up to kill Flag mobs? What happens to CB, VoLS, FK, and ED? Nothing I presume since their reputation has been known around the rathe as been good. A free ride, no backlash, nothing. Look out Rathe, I think more guilds are gonna do a zerg rush of these mobs before a rule is set in stone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You are under the very mistaken impression that there was no backlash for FK/ED teaming for AD (a couple of months ago, btw).  The difference between the PoP gods issue at hand and the named drakes issue, is that the named drakes already WERE a part of the Doze rotation.  The teaming on PoP gods is still being &quot;discussed&quot; but there has been no rule set.  Just because there's no rule written in stone, however, does not mean there isn't or hasn't been backlash.  You haven't seen FK teaming up with anyone else since then, have you?<br>

<br>
if ya want to grow and upgrade yer DPS a lot.. indeed farm the shit out of ST .. primals upgrade yer DPS a shitload.. and yes try to do stuff like NTOV and tuanre and try the ssra mobs.. when you can as a guild rather then teaming up with another guild for fast acces...it will make the wins and achievements SO much  more enjoyable... i can tell ya from experience.. VoF used to be small and not well equiped much like i guess CB is.. we had a members list of 40 peeps and we had maybe half of that on fr raids most of the time.<br>
<br>
i can member when VoF was so small we could not even do Fear well.. we had to ask SoT for help with CR cuz we simply could not cut it ourselves.. look how we have grown.<br>
<br>
guildwise there are not big upgrades in PoP will you hit the elemental planes.. so my advice would be to not focus so much on PoP cuz it is not that uber exp in te higher ter zones as ya´ll believe.. kill NToV kill AoW and what else i have posted to gain power in the guild and then you can easily do PoP with yer own guild and progress with enjoyment.<br>
a lot of people i have seen posting here JUST want to raid in PoP and forget the rest.. granted the exp is not so good cuz  almost everyone is lvl 65 now.. but that does not mean guild  have to skip old expansions.. i for one would like to farm the shitznitz out of Ssra cuz there is a LOT of uber shit there... <p>If we are born to Die...... &lt;br&gt;Why fight for Life...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

Do you guys send your members to another zone when you have 90 members on and say, &quot;sorry we can't zerg?&quot;. I'll answer my rhetorical question with a &quot;HELL, NO&quot;. You guys are notorious for trying mobs out mobs with as many players as you can. Why? Because it maximizes your DPS and your chance at mobs.

We never have 90 members online for any mob, ever.<br>
The only mob we even draw 80 for is Rallos Zek, and a lot of those were being 2boxed.  95% of the time we fall below the 72 person raid limit.  So... what?<br>
<br>
72 is a far cry from 150-200+, thanks!<br>

No.  If Verant had other possibilities, they would have never removed the unlimited flag count from a Planar Projection.  People were zerging down mobs on other servers with the combined effort of other guilds, so this is one of the reasons they changed this.<br>

<br>
Just because you and your guild are too lazy to progress through Luclin doesn't mean it's a sad day.  And just because you and your guild are too lazy to progress through PoP legitimately doesn't mean it's a sad day, either.  You people act like you should be able to access PoTime without doing any actual work to get there.<br>
<br>
Why don't you and your guild farm emp key parts and VT shards and go see VT?  &quot;because we don't want to see VT!!&quot;  Why?  It's something you haven't seen before.  Then why do you want to see the zones from PoP that are as difficult as VT and moreso? <br>
<br>
Not that I'm saying HoH is.. or Tactics is... but Mithaniel Marr, Bertox, Saryn, Vallon Zek, and Tallon Zek aren't on rotations... so what's to prevent you from zerging those mobs down and then just deciding fuck it and zerging down RZ so you can gain access to the elemental planes?<br>
<br>
You're damn right I don't want someone in full hate/fear/kunark armor to come trouncing into the elemental planes because they were part of a 200 man zerg rush and then start competing for the same mobs as us, considering my guild has been busting our asses to get there.  I wouldn't care if there were 4+ guilds in the eles, if they all got there respectfully.  You hate me for that?  Oh well. <br>

How does this figure of 150-200+ relate to the CB/VoLS event?  We had 72.<br>

Guess what?  Verant sold the game to people who aren't in upper tier guilds.  Yes, it does have an end-game that will never be reached by &quot;the weak&quot; just like every other expansion.  However, I think a strong argument can be made that HoH doesn't qualify as such.  For god's sake, most of the mobs in the zone are soloable.<br>

<br>
I suspect that the major reason that this was eliminated was not the possibility of two smaller guilds teaming up to take down the mob.  Verant probably had a bigger issue with the fact that the instant that one of these large mobs dropped, dozens of alts, friends and random people from the zone were also getting flagged.<br>

Wow, got angst?  And when was it said that any guild was joining with another to do a PoTime raid?  The entire reason for the joint raid was to get people flagged for an XP zone.<br>

I have no idea where you got this concept.  Unless you are regretting wasting YOUR time in VT when PoP has better offerings.  Speaking for CB, we have no intention of missing Velious and Luclin content.  We are currently 3 keys shy of our minimum number goal to attempt to get onto the ST rot.  We killed Vindi 15 times in March to try to speed up this process.  We have attempted Sontalak no less than 6 times in the last two weeks to get more keys for this goal.  NToV and ST are the current goals of this guild, but on 3 of the last 5 days, we have been killing mobs in Ssra to complete emp keys.  We plan on doing other things, just because you regret wasting your time there, you shouldn't accuse us of planning on skipping content.<br>

<br>
Boy, you are really paranoid.  AD goes down and we are already zerging RZ.  Calm yourself.  I will repeat what I have said several times.  We joined with VoLS to get access to an XP zone, not to beat the big guilds on the server to PoTime!<br>

I wouldn't care if there were 4+ guilds in the eles, if they all got there respectfully. You hate me for that? Oh well. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You know, I love the fact that we keep getting accused of &quot;zerging&quot; our way in.  We had a raid of 72 people take out AD.  We used the MT strat (which many people have pointed out is the &quot;wrong&quot; way to do it) and our MT didn't die!  I am guessing that that means that we must not have lost too many clerics either.  We used 2 druids and 1 wizzie as crowd control for the golems.  Only one got through.  After a couple seconds of confusion following the death of AD, several groups broke away from the AD pull area and started killing golems.  Does this sound like zerging to you?!  Or does this sound like a nicely executed, well planned strategy implemented in a sound manner by skilled players?  There was no zerging that night!<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Have the terms 'dignity' and 'accomplishment' lost all meaning? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, both terms are alive and well in CB.  Dignity is one of our highest ideals.  Something we try to treat all players with regardless of level or guild tag.  It is something that this guild has made a reputation for over many years.  Accomplishment we see every day.  Whether it is completing quests for guildies, taking down new rotation mobs, trying out new content or teaming with a great group of players like VoLS to kill a mob that requires greater numbers of people than we can apply to it alone. <p>Gatori Vonhinx<br>

But I still feel that you're making an alliance to take advantage of a mob that each entity could not kill on its own, and yet, remaininig seperate for mobs that you can.  That's kinda weak to say the least.  This would be like Tindi breaking in half and naming ourselves T2 and T3.  Each guild gets a spot on AOW rot, but when it comes time to do a mob that neither entity could do by itself, we combine to form T1!<br>
<br>
Obviously I did not mean you downing AD means you're ready for RZ.  The point is, you'd form an alliance with even more people/guilds, and yet remain seperate entities, when it comes time for RZ because he is the key piece to gain access to the zones with the best loot and exp in the game atm.<br>
<br>
You claim that you're did/are doing it to get access to exp zones, well how is RZ any different?  The elementals are the best source of exp for groups from what I've seen so far.<br>
<br>
Why not just make a new guild?  There would be no issues with that, not with me at least. :P<br>

Oh and, but if you haven't cleared NtoV yet or even beaten Aary, how the hell are you going to 'exp' in these zones? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shogonramel>Shogon Ramel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/4/03 1:28:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.t-online.de/home/520013139003-001/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Shogon, does that number include all the charmed pets you guys used as tanks versus Rallos Zek? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
How about understanding that it doesn't matter what something  is &quot;GEARED TOWARD&quot;.  Verant didn't make this game with camping or pulling in mind either when it first came out.<br>
<br>
This entire game is about figuring how you can accomplish things against the odds that are placed before you.  Outside of cheating, as defined by Verant, there is no &quot;incorrect way&quot; to tackle a situation, nor is doing it one way &quot;better&quot; than doing it another.<br>

<br>
That my point exactly, they decided that they wanted a single raid force to accomplish a task, and no more people.  They also decided to raise the raid cap to 72 people, and have left it there for a while.<br>
<br>
Notice that they designed these encounters to be destroyed as a RAID and not necessarily as a GUILD.  There is no shame in people from multiple guilds helping each other overcome an obstacle.

This was by far the most insulting part of your post.  Who says their guild is too LAZY to do either thing?  Maybe they DO NOT WANT to play everquest that way.  Perhaps they want to take a different path.  That is their RIGHT, and it is not against the RULES.  If they, or their friends can overcome new content without trying the old, there is NOTHING wrong with that, except for some ill-conceived notion you have in your own head.<br>

The &quot;too lazy to progress through PoP legitimately&quot; is the most eye-catchign part.  How exactly is a group of 72 people killing a flag mob, regardless of guild affiliation, &quot;illegitimate&quot;?  <br>
<br>
Please enlighten me as to how a group of people accomplishing a task within a system that the game creators themselves made is illegitimate?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Have the terms 'dignity' and 'accomplishment' lost all meaning? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So, two hard working guilds expending all of their might in a combined effort to overcome an encounter that is extremely difficult to them should not feel that they have 'accomplished' anything and should suffer a shot to their 'dignity' because they had to use each other's help?<br>
<br>
Well, I'm sorry, but that is, by far, one of the most rediculous things I have ever heard before in my life.  <br>
<br>
If I need to lift a 300 pound box into the back of a truck because I want to get it to another location, but I cannot lift the 300 pounds by myself, I ask my friend to help me.  When the two of us put the box in the truck, I feel a sense of accomplishment because not only did I participate in the completion of my objective, but I also have the box in the truck now, and can benefit from that in the future.  I do not feel that I have lost any dignity or integrity because I had to ask my friend to help me.<br>
<br>
Also, now that the 300 pound box is in the truck, I don't need his help with the box any more, so there is no reason for me to make him stand around and watch me pick up smaller 50 pound boxes.<br>
<br>
You guys are grasping at straws HARD to find a reason to keep people from teaming up.  When it comes down to it, and we see that your reasons are illogical by promoting the use of reason and rules (as they currently stand), we can only conclude that the reason you want to keep people out is for those greed-based reasons that have already been stated.<br>
<br>
I personally would like to think that the larger guilds have better people than that.  But, then someone like Shogon comes along, and spews off this kind of crap.<br>
<br>
WAKE UP PEOPLE.  There is no integrity, honor, dignity, or anything else lost when people work together to accomplish a goal.  If these mobs are NOT on a rotation, and people are not breaking any of Verant's rules, then they should not feel bad about their accomplishments.  Nor should they be made to feel bad about them for no reason.<br>

While I understand your analogy... the 300 pound box was obviously not meant to be picked up by one person, rather by multiple people.<br>
<br>
The same can not be said for events such as RZ, where it is clearly doable with 1 guild.<br>
<br>
And so Jeshter, by your logic, 2000 people getting together, assuming zero lag and perfect framerate, would be no different than 72 getting together and killing a mob?  LOL!<br>

Shogun, you have a definite fascination with numbers, but seem to be always talking about the wrong ones.  What do the numbers 100+ or 150+ have to do with anything?  Nobody has suggested teaming to take out RZ.  He is a rotation mob.  The topic we are debating is non-rotation mobs that give flags for 3rd tier zones.<br>

Here is what I forsee will happen.  All flag mobs will become rotation mobs eventually, likely very soon ...regardless of what is desired by the general (read lower teir 1) community.

The 'discussion' in the guild rep forum has already gone silent ...make no mistake, there is a discussion taking place ...you just can't see it or hear it.  In the end, the higher level guilds will get what they think is fair for us and what they think we need.  Once on rotations, there will be no more teaming of flag mobs, so your guild can look forward to a very long journey through the 'conventional' path set forth by your high level guild predecessors because, truly, that is really the ONLY WAY TO BE SUCCESSFUL and progress through this 'linear-based, non-static' game environment.

I was never privy to any decision that was made regarding this.  Also, you say it is frowned upon . . . by whom?  Give me a rule on the RTA and CB will follow it to the letter.  I see no such rule.  <br>

LOL, I was unaware of this. I had assumed they were raid zones only, similar to TOV, VT or ST. <p>Gatori Vonhinx<br>

<br>
Why is teaming such a big issue?<br>
<br>
How is teaming different from a Hate raid?  (where the host guild has several other guilds with them?)<br>
<br>
I understand and agree with the reservations about teaming on Rotation mobs.<br>
<br>
What are the REAL REASONS you don't like it?<br>
Don't say its not fair to teams that don't team up, that is a Guild by Guild choice.<br>
<br>
No name calling, I am just asking for you logical reply.   You want us to back you on it, then explain it, in full, think about what you put in and maybe you won't meet the responses that you have.<br>
<br>
I see no logical reason someone (meaning guild entities) would not be allowed to team up.<br>
<br>
Most of us take part in pickup groups, that is technically teaming up to kill mobs.  I want to say more but can't think of how to say it correctly.  Besides the pure scale of the encounter, how is taking down flag mobs in teams, different than a single group hunting?  You are killing a NPC.  The only problem that most people have here is the fact that every person there does not wear the same guild tag.   What is the difference? <p>Keana Silverwolf&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;

Anyways...<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How exactly is a group of 72 people killing a flag mob, regardless of guild affiliation, &quot;illegitimate&quot;?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I also posted earlier that 72 people is not zerg.  Please read before replying.<br>
<br>
My point is, they claim to have done this to gain access to more exp spots.  Well as I've stated already, twice, the elementals offer way better exp than HoH does.  So what's to stop them from teaming up with an additional guild till they have the numbers to down him?  After all, they're only after more exp spots!  And let's face it, with all the content they'd try to skip(thus missing tons of gear upgrades) to get to elementals, they'd need 150+ people to down RZ, which just ties back in with all my original posts.<br>

And by saying this, you're basically saying any number of people is acceptable, because it's a different way to tackle a situation, which conflicts with your statement of:<br>

Again, if you're willing to piss off guilds by teaming, why would you hesitate to piss them off by breaking rotations?  You're only after exp spots!<br>
<br>
So what if the RTA suddenly decides to put AD, Grummus, and Behemoth on rotation?  You'll just suddenly stop teaming?
