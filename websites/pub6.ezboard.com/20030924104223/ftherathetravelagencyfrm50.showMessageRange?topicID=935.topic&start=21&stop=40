In an easy to read, perhaps bulleted fashion, why don't YOU list the reasons you DON'T think it should still be reservable.  I will then offer counterpoints or agree based on what you say.  My suggestion above is that guilds reserve it for the same reason as before.  Only now, in 4 hours you get say 20 shots at getting a chanter epic instead of 3.<br>

You are asking the wrong question - it's not &quot;Why should we leave it as is?&quot; but &quot;Why should we fix what isn't broken?&quot;  As Nycah pointed out the numbers for you, most of the time Hate is open to xp grinding.  But if someone wants to have the zone to themselves to get epic pieces or armor or gems for the guild fund without having to worry about disturbing that one xp group's mobs in the corner, then I think it's great to have the current system in place.  It works, you can go up 24 of 31 days, and the other 7 who reserved the plane got what they wanted without disturbing you.<br>

I was talking about &quot;having a zone to one's self&quot;.  Whether &quot;one&quot; means you, your group, or your guild, of course having the zone to yourself is generally preferable to having to share.

What Karadin's said makes sense as a sort of prohpylactic rule.  I guess I just want to know what it is about Hate that it's reservable, while other similar sorts of zones, also with rare drops that every guild would like, are not subject to a calendar.

<br>
The fast repop does not warrent a zone wide 'reserved day'. As far as I can see by the pulls, spawns are a mixture of static regular mobs (IE: That one by the door will always be a cleric) and random regular mobs (That one can be anything that spawns in this area). <br>
<br>
There are two raid targets of fairly high difficulty, Inny and Maestro. The hand can be fought to a draw pretty effectively with a single group, and while I've never done it, I suspect it could be killed with 2 groups, give or take. (Milage my vary). <br>
<br>
The zone in area is now completely safe. More than just safe, however, I'd go so far to say immune to all non-intentional-train aggro. <br>
<br>
Since there is no zone out, anyone who trains in hate, is a moron (there's no where to go...) Mobs don't path close enough to the zone in to aggro on port in, like they used to (One of the reasons I imagine it was made a raid zone- the safety of knowing 3 more groups were coming up to reinforce in case group 1 and 2 wiped).<br>
<br>
I would venture to say that Hate is now on par with Sebilis in terms of level range. Mobs are a little bit tougher, but they path much better than before, and the zone has a very cleanly drawn line of sight aggro, with the same &quot;Fuck I touched a wall, time to die&quot; aggro that we all know and love from the old hate. <br>
<br>
To farm epic items, I would say that you have room for anywhere between 3 and 5 fully operating groups, so long as they know where they all are, and don't step on each others toes. The repop is very quick, and there are 2/3/4 mobs to a house, usually. This does, naturally, depend on the ability of the 'harder mobs' to drop epic items.  (Upgraded names, like Ashenbone Drake becomes Hatebone Drake, for an increase of some damage and hp). If only the wimp normal mobs drop epic stuff, than my estimate cuts to 2 groups, maybe 3 slow pulling, lower level groups. <br>
<br>
The point, however, is that the items can be farmed with a group of level 51ish players. It is no longer a raid-to-get-epic-pieces zone, it is a farmfest. The ability of one guild to reserve the plane for 16ish hours is excessive for the persuit of epic drops that can be snagged with 5 other like minded planable folk. <br>
<br>
As you may have guessed by the tone of this post, my non-rta admin thoughts on the subject is that the zone should be moved off of a calandar reservations system, and that desireable mobs like Maestro and Inny should be, only if there is interest, moved to rotation status, or FCFS status until they are in very high demand. <br>
<br>
Lukieb's obvious disdain for any and all things rotation aside, this is one area that the agreement between guilds does indeed have room for change, if not compromise. <br>
<br>
For the record, however, until something is formally agreed upon, my RTA self reminds you that the zone rules are still the zone rules, and that self apointed rule changes arn't kosher. <br>
<br>
There is a thread in the Guild rep forum that will/should cover in more detail. <br>

<br>
I will assume you have spent that 20 hours with a single group (it's not clear, but it certainly seemed implied), and in that 20 hours, how many enchanter epic pieces have you managed to grab in that farmfest?  Wouldn't the law of averages dictate that if you took 4-5+ groups for 2 hours, and cleared the whole front half of the floor, that you would have better odds at getting the one piece you do care about?<br>
<br>
Hate goes unreserved enough, that I think it's possible to handle both types of play.  Guilds aren't posting reservations just to be greedy, and most guilds don't bother reserving Hate at all.  Nycah's posted useage of Hate was something like a 7/24 day split between reserved/unreserved days in July.  Removing Hate from the calendar removes the ability for guilds that either can't handle it any other way, or who want to make sure they don't affect others negatively.  I know that if a larger guild was going in and planned on doing mass AE pulls, tempers may flare.  Leaving it on the calendar allows for the very limited times it may be used as such, and the remaining majority of the days can be used to xp grind/farmfest to your heart's content.  Best of both worlds, no? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shariona>Shariona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mirth's Virtue - Guild Rep</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/13/03 1:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=935.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Plane of Hate</span><hr size=1> On the enchanter piece.<br>

I would like to point out that Mirth's Virtue has reserved this plane for this purpose..I think 3 times now.<br>
<br>
We have taken exp groups there at least 2 to 3 times per week for the last 3 weeks.<br>
<br>
And one of our enchanters has been to Hate close to 20 times now.<br>
<br>
No chanter piece.<br>
It doesn't matter how fast the respawn, if the drop is rare.<br>
<br>
We intend on our next raid to clear the zone to see if we can get the stupid piece.<br>
<br>
The last thing we ned in addition to frustrated chanters is exp grinding groups bitchin cause we our AEs hit their mob through a wall.<br>

Take this off the calendar, and it will be a major anger fest.<br>

<br>
I would say that if we are keeping this zone on the calander, you might as well put PoN, PoD, PoJ, PoT, etc, etc on the calander as well. They are all exp zones and all have major mobs in them for a raid force. <br>
<br>
As a member of a guild that can reserve a day, yeah, it is nice to reserve a day and send up a few groups to exp, or epic farm. But as a player, and as someone that can sympathize with those from smaller guilds, it is wrong to keep it on the calander. <br>
If one group can own the zone, then there is no need for reserving it. (Mage, Druid, Enchanter, Cleric, Wizard, Shaman)<br>
<br>
Basically, just put Inny/Maestro on a rotation and let people enjoy the zone as the fun exp zone it has become. Who cares if it is not reserved muc? It should not be reserved at all anymore. Any chance I can reserve PoS for flags?<br>

I will assume you have spent that 20 hours with a single group (it's not clear, but it certainly seemed implied), and in that 20 hours, how many enchanter epic pieces have you managed to grab in that farmfest? Wouldn't the law of averages dictate that if you took 4-5+ groups for 2 hours, and cleared the whole front half of the floor, that you would have better odds at getting the one piece you do care about?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I do see the point; in that 20 hours, exactly 0 pieces dropped. In fact, in 32 hours, 0 have dropped. We did, however, get one of every other epic drop. <br>
<br>
As I wrote in the guild rep forum, I have no problem with hate remaining reserved for a guild's raid. What I do suggest, however, is that it is unreasonable to claim the entire zone for an entire 24 hour period for a 4, 6, 10,12 hour raid in that zone. The other time that people may want to kill in the zone, should still be open to them. Previously, any guild entering a reserved plane and killing mobs would have their posting rights removed for 30 days. (Per infraction, culmatively). <br>
<br>
I suggest that since the repop is so much sooner, that there is no negative impact on a guild if people kill there before their raid time, even up until the moment of their raid time. I would be more than willing to vacate hate for a guild scheduled on the calandar, but I suggest that it is outside the boundaries to also restrict the rest of the server from entering the zone and killing the mobs that will respawn in 20 minutes. <br>
<br>
Speaking to the law of averages, they will have no less chance in their raid time to get a dropped epic item as if the zone was completely empty for the 24 hours previous to their entry. The mobs will spawn with as much frequency and chance to drop an item as always. <br>
<br>
I know you know, Karadin, but to speak to those that might think that if an item drops for a group an hour before the raid, that there would be less chance of it dropping for the raid, that is not a correct assumption. A one in ten chance, or one in 100 is always that same chance, regardless of how long since the last time it has happened. If a drop is one in 10, each mob has a one in ten chance of dropping it, regardless of if it is the 50th mob in a row without the item, or the first mob and it has the item. The chance of the item drop determines if the item will drop, not the amount of time since the last drop. <br>
<br>
In any event, it's stuff to chew on for a while. <br>

EDIT: Also another thing to keep in mind. Controling the zone as it is may not be possible anymore. Reason being is if a few level 50 toons can do do something then you will then be dealing with people the don't even know about the RTA. I have been up there myself and solo'd mobs up there and I'm just 1 person. In the end I think it may just end up punishing those of us whom follow the RTA guildlines. <br>

<br>
In the past month I have been to hate 4 times, last month at least 6 times and each time were for at least a couple hours. This has been both for exploring, exping and for enchanter epic piece all of which has been a single group. I had no problem going on a FFA day and made sure not to go on a reserved day. Twice there was another group there and with us spaced out fairly well we still managed to pull the place pretty clean and have time to sit waiting for repops.<br>
<br>
I haven't been in the zone when there has been any type of fighting or disagreements because no one would let a group exp there. Yes its a decent place to get exp but I haven't seen any conflicts or problems with people getting exp or any fights starting because of it. Its not populated like a PoP zone or even KC of old where you have multiple groups stepping on each other. If that starts happening, then sure I can see taking a look at changing it but since its not, why bother?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Why should it still stay a reserved zone?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I will not mention any guild names since it was resolved from what I understand. However this is a perfect example and reason why. Its partly a matter of respect and that this protects smaller guilds and alliances.<br>
<br>
I was a guest at a raid for a guild that had reserved the plane. They were going up to fight the mini's, some training as well as to get epic pieces. There were 4 groups in the raid and we were clearing the zone in. Suddenly a group from another guild ports up and then more and more start showing up. We told them it was a reserved day and they ignored us, eventually turned kind of vocal for a few people and then was eventually settled.<br>
<br>
What I find disturbing is first it was reserved. The larger guild who is a RTA member should of known it was, should of repsected the smaller guilds night. I mean there are over 20 unreserved days and they planned a raid on a reserved day. Yes the mobs repop in 20 mins. They were there to take down Hand that the guild I was a guest of was not going too. They didn't ask though, they just showed up and when asked to leave wouldn't. <br>
<br>
Sure there aren't the trains that train the whole zones but there still are trains although small ones. Yes the mobs respawn in 20 mins, however the mini's do not. So they cleared a path which left us with 20 mins of downtime, more if they cleared any mini's on the way. Who knows if any epic pieces dropped from those trash they cleared, who knows what drops were lost out. <br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is a larger guild pushed their way in because they could. Like I said the matter was basically resolved between the guilds, although I don't agree I'm not going to take it up with the RTA. However I can pretty much bet the bank that if you open it up, it will happen a lot more frequently. It might not at first but give it a couple months and you'd have 3 exp groups up there, large guild comes by to raid Inny stepping on the smaller groups there.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.protoculturex.com/pictures/senzillsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Nowhere did I state, imply, or infer that the item that dropped an hour ago would be more or less likely to have dropped for the raid force had an earlier group not been there.  I simply stated that if a guild has it reserved, and is there primarily for epic drops, that pulling/killing 100 mobs has a greater chance of dropping the piece they want than 80 mobs.  Simply put, the more times you kill the appropriate mobs, the more chances the game engine has of rolling that certain percentage that says &quot;Yay enchanter piece!&quot;  Reservations also help prevent scuffles between a raid force looking for 100 mobs to AE pull, and the normal xp group clearing 20 mobs from coming into conflict.<br>
<br>
I have no problems with removing the penalty clauses for &quot;being in hate on a reserved date&quot;, provided that only covers the time a raiding guild isn't in hate.  I also think some verbage should be put in, that if the raid guild doesn't mind you being there (they are there for Hand, Maestro, and Inny, you want to xp and loot diamonds), that this too is acceptable.  I agree there is no reason a group shouldn't be allowed to go up before and/or after a raid that has it reserved and kill normal mobs.<br>
<br>
I still see a valid reason for keeping Hate on the Calendar for those who need to reserve it, and there are plenty of days Hate goes unreserved such that there is no need to remove it.  If Hate was reserved so often that no one could get access to it, and those guilds reserving it were abusing it such that the zone went unused, I could see a reason to remove it.  That is not the case. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=senzii>Senzii</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.protoculturex.com/steeltalons/forum/non-cgi/emoticons/yin-yang.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/14/03 12:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=935.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Plane of Hate</span><hr size=1> I believe for the reasons I stated above that PoH should stay on the calendar. However there is no reason why we can't modify the rules to include a few additions. For example if a date is reserved and someone wants Inny/Hand or even to exp they should get permission of the reserved guild. I believe guilds can work things out just fine among themselves. Some will naturally say no, don't come in and the guilds should respect that. However most of the time if they aren't going to kill most people will let them go through, the point is to at least show the respect to ask and respect their decision. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.protoculturex.com/pictures/senzillsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Interesting thought...but has anyone ever held a raid in Seb?<br>
<br>
<br>
While I agree CB should have noproblem sending a group in to clear Hate, there are still guilds out there who need a raid force to get very far.<br>
<br>
We haven't tried Inny ..yet...but I am certain we will not do it without a raid force.<br>
<br>
Yes the entrance area is doable by a group, we have done it a lot...all the way to the steps near Maestro...past that ...nope.<br>
<br>
There are a LOT of guilds who are in that stage where Hate is still a challenging raid zone, and for the same reasons it was put on the calendar...it should stay onthe calendar.<br>
<br>
NOT for the ubah guilds to have a day of farm fest...but so the not ubah guild can raid.<br>
<br>
Rogg, while I respect your opinion on a lotof things...I don't think you and I can see this zone the same way. Grats ..but CB is past this area. <br>

I'm suggesting we can kill the stuff that respawns in 30 minutes with 6 people. The mobs beyond maestro's stairs are not all that much more difficult than those before. The highest number I've ever been hit for in hate, is approximately 500. With a cleric there, this is a mob I could have tanked when I was wearing my first mix of skyshrine and piecemeal thurgadin velious armors. In fact, this is likely a mob I could have tanked when I was wearing royal velium entirely. A 4.5k buffed tank would be able to deal with this mob, in a group of 6. <br>
<br>
Aye, we are beyond raiding to kill mobs like that, but that's not the point. The point is that the mob will be back in 30 minutes. Not an hour, not 8 hours, not 3 days, not 7 days, but 30 minutes. If a group requires even 12 to 18 people to kill a mob like that, it is likely that they won't get to that area of hate before the 30 minutes has elapsed, from the zone in. Therefore, there is almost zero downtime if all those mobs were dead at the start of their raid, to when they get there and have the mobs begin to repop. If anything it would make it easier to kill as they reappear, rather than have 3/4 mobs in one area to single pull or crowd control. Before the issue of 'but they want to challenge themselves, they don't want you to make it easy' comes up, they'd need wait only about 5 minutes longer to make sure it had all repopped ahead of them. <br>
<br>
I'm not trying to piss in anyone's pool, I'm trying to make sure the rules we use, reflect the way the zone is now built. <br>
