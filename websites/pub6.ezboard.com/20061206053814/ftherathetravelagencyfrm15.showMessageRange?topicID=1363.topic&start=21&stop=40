<br>
...because it's a potential reason to leave the zone alone for the full 24 hours? If the mob that started a hypothetical scripted event was easily killable, thus blowing the event for anyone who wanted to try, it would be a reason to leave the rules as is; where you see 'bulk' and can't figure it out, I offer items that might be influencing factors, and show why they are not relevant. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Oh and do try and figure out how some questions are not yes and no, black and white.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Uh, I don't know if you noticed, or not, but the questions were all 'yes' or 'no' answers. Unless you'd like the rules to be subjective, and not objective? <br>
<br>
That is, the rules would be situational based on what would be 'best' for a group or two, and not 'best' for the server in general? Because although there is no *logical* reason why the rules would stay the way you seem to want them, there is the reason you've been able to come up with, something to the tune of &quot;because I want them that way&quot; or &quot;I don't want to be wrong&quot;. <br>
<br>
I said why I wanted the rules changed, and offered the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>very</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> black and white reasons why. There was no &quot;Well, I sorta feel that people might like it better&quot; involved. I offered you many opportunities, and more over actually went so far as to say &quot;tell me, show me, give me an example&quot;. I'm still waiting for a reply from you that wasn't geared out of the &quot;but people didn't follow the rules&quot; camp. As I've shown, your points were not relevant to the discussion. <br>
<br>
There was no grey area, so therefore, when something is a simple black and white distinction, I don't have to pretend there is grey area for someone who can't put 1 and 1 together and get 2. <br>
<br>
Do see above about people like that, won't you?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
But other than that, yes you are quite good at oratory. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I can filabuster all I want about a logical fallicy; I cannot answer direct questions about it without falling flat. <br>
<br>
If you'll notice, the only differance between my attempting to have the rules changed, and your attempt to keep them the same, was that my end stood up to questioning. <br>
<br>
Your directions to throw away any compromise, and invoking the dreaded FFA debating method only helped me make my case. (See also <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/G/Godwins-Law.html" target="top">Godwins Law</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, and replace instances of &quot;Nazi&quot; or &quot;Hitler&quot; with &quot;FFA&quot; ) <br>
<br>
If you are going to be bitter that I had a logical, provable and better position than you did from which to debate, I have to point out that I didn't invent the new circumstances for Hate, I only asked that we start using the zone in a way that reflects the changes in it. <br>
<br>
If hate started off in the form it is currently in, I hestitate to think of any person who would see it as a zone that demanded a 24 hour reservation, rather than rotations on the boss mobs. <br>
<br>
There is, and was when I started discussing it, a case to be made for removal from the calandar and rotation of the boss mobs (even as you panicked and pretended that is what I was asking for). We're not all so quick to throw away the idea of compromise when we can't get what we want. I at least, saw the camp that said &quot;we'd still like it on reservation&quot; and thought of a compromise that would work for everyone, and moved my viewpoint accordingly and happily work for common ground that works well if everyone follows the rules. And then, to combat those who might not follow the rules, I moved to discuss a stiffer punishment for breaking the rules. <br>
<br>
What was your reaction?<br>
<br>
I think you indicated that if there was any compromise, the zone should just go to boss mob rotations and then jumped on the cockblocking and free for all buzzword bandwagons, to cut down on the stupid arguments on the RTA. <br>
<br>
Frankly, if you'd like to cut down on the stupid arguments on the rta, might I suggest not pressing the reply button?<br>
<br>
Did I mention how glad I am that you replied to the flame that I baited for you? I am honestly tempted beyond measure to find your replies and jump on them with both feet, as I had to restrain myself from doing on the general forums. The only two things holding me back, are that it couldn't change your mind, and you wouldn't change the subject. <br>

Some day, Chesse, I'd like to see that library you're building.  I have maybe 3 hardcovers, all the rest are paperbacks, and some of them are just falling apart from age and being read so much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seerfamily>Seer Family</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User and Abuser!</span><br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/26/03 3:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p081.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1363.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m colspan=2><span class=title>   Re: HOW DO YOU PEOPLE REMEMBER TO BREATHE?!?</span><hr size=1> Oh yea..I agree Maureen's story was wonderful.<br>

I had read all his works up to that point and was a big fan.<br>
<br>
I worked for the local CBS affiliate at the time and he was a guest on our daily local talk show. I was a studio cameraman (among other jobs), fresh out of high-shool at the time.<br>
<br>
He was in his early 70's at the time, quiet and softspoken, but still very interesting and complex.<br>
<br>
That job allowed me to meet many interesting people, most I have forgetten sorry to say. A few I remember...<br>
<br>
Ansel Adams<br>
Linus Pauling<br>
Gore Vidal<br>
Edward Weston<br>
Paul Anka<br>
Clint Eastwood<br>
John Madden<br>
<br>
The monterey bay area (Monterey, Pacific Grove, Carmel, Santa Cruz) has a great many famous artists, writers, and thinkers residing. It was a great place to live at the time.<br>

Ah yes, the tired &quot;I have a life&quot; defense. I prefer the title &quot;I've lost the argument and have absolutely no ground left to stand on, unless I attack his spelling&quot; defense. Popular belief? I know I've lost sleep over it.<br>

I've been long winded before, I'll be long winded again. <br>
<br>
However, in this case, I have, at most, three things to say. <br>
<br>
First, your lack of reading comprehension ability is born of only one of two possible things. The first is that you are being willfully blind to something that you, in truth, cannot justify arguing against. In that case, you are a hypocrite of the finest kind. The second is that you have the ability to reason with the skill of a small monkey. When, if ever, you address an argument with a clairity that does not approach a primate flinging their own shit and ejaculate, I'll reassess my vision of you. Do hurry, we're all desperately waiting for you to catch up. (We're not actually, I'm being sarcastic)<br>
<br>
Second, your ability to deny and self delude is now legendary to me. I will, likely forever more, refer to someone who has the inability to grasp a concept coupled with the inability to be educated about the concept, as suffering from SeerSyndrome. <br>
<br>
Third, and for the sake of the return to the subject of this topic, I suggest you pin a small piece of paper to the inside of your eyelids, that reads<br>
<br>
Step 1: Inhale<br>
Step 2: Exhale<br>
Step 3: Repeat as needed<br>
<br>
to help you get by. <br>
<br>
As for the return to science fiction:<br>
<br>
Enders Game. Best book of all time, or pretender to the throne. <br>
<br>
You decide. <br>

This was pretty much the same thing I gathered.  Because of that, no matter what you say or how well you say it.. only what he/she (?) wants to see will come across.<br>
<br>
You will just frustrate yourself more trying to reason.. its time to go Drache style and do some creative renaming or something.<br>
<br>
I would use the irony intrinsic in the name &quot;Seer&quot; and the blindness shown in the posts you refer to and have a field day.<br>

Ender's Game -- Great book.  I also  have worn out a few copies.  I recently read the first &quot;sequel&quot; Ender's Shadow, and that was really good, too.  Same story, different perspective.  We now have the next 2 &quot;sequels&quot; to that, haven't read them yet, hubby got them first!!<br>
