Bon moi je fais un gros effort (un peu plus de copier coller et touts les dialogues en prime :<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
WARNING<br>
DO NOT perform any of the quest turn-ins while using Form of the Great Bear. This quest will only trigger with proper TRUE SPIRIT FACTION is detected by the quest NPCs. Reports have been received that being in Bear  Form during epic-item turn-ins may BUG the quest NPCs to misread your True Spirit faction and cause the quest trigger to FAIL!<br>
<br>
There are several methods for beginning the quest, among which have been reported are:<br>
Ocean of Tears, loc +800, -5400, Capt Surestout<br>
Rathe Mountains, (on cyclops hill), Blinde the Cutpurse <br>
Butcherblock Mountains, +260, +1650, Peg Leg <br>
Field of Bones, (marauder cave), Iksar Outcast/Manslayer<br>
<br>
While the information here is gleened from conversations with Capt. Surestout, it is reported that any of the above will yield the same information and &quot;tiny gem&quot;. Here is the Surestout method of beginning the quest:<br>
<br>
 Go to Gornit's island in OOT, approx. loc 800, -5400, kill Capt Surestout (green con at level 54, one ebolt kills him). A lesser spirit will spawn where he's killed, hail the spirit. <br>
<br>
Capt Surestout died.<br>
a lesser spirit begins to cast a spell.<br>
a lesser spirit's body pulses with energy.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail a lesser spirit'<br>
a lesser spirit says 'Did you take this person's life, shaman? <br>
a lesser spirit regards you indifferently -- You could probably win this fight.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Yes'<br>
a lesser spirit says 'Why have you taken this person's life? Did he threaten your life? Did you<br>
dislike him? Or was his death a profit to you in some way? <br>
<br>
You say, 'He threatened my life'<br>
a lesser spirit says 'I see. It brings me sadness to see another die, but his heart was black and<br>
a great nothingness. His body will become the grass now. Thank you for what you have done,<br>
shaman. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Who are you?'<br>
a lesser spirit says 'What, or who, I am isn't as important as what, or who, WE are. Do you wish to know more, shaman? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to know more'<br>
a lesser spirit says 'That is good. Take this gem. It is a part of us like the clouds to the sky and is a wonderful gift from the grandfather. Take this gem to where the humans gather to spoil the land and water. Some call it a port. There you will find one of us, a shaman like yourself. Give him the gem and perhaps he will tell you more of the spirits.<br>
<br>
The Drunken Shaman<br>
<br>
Head to North Freeport. Go in the sewers in the northwestern part of town, a little ways in on the inside of a colapsed wall is Bondl Felligan. Give the gem to him. <br>
<br>
 You say, 'hail Bondl Felligan'<br>
 Bondl Felligan burps loudly in your face and says, 'Bah! Leave me be, fool! You have nothin' I  want and I certainly have nothin' you want.' <br>
<br>
Give Bondl the &quot;tiny gem&quot;.<br>
Bondl Felligan says 'WOW, thanks! This must be worth a fortune! I could drink for a month after sellin' this to one of them fool merchants. I'm going to see how much I can get for it right now! <br>
<br>
Next wait for him to move, follow him back out of the sewers onto the land outside, there he will stop and speak to you. <br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan says 'What!? You don't approve of me buyin' some drinks with this gem? Who the heck are you to offer me a gift and order me what to do with it? Is this some kinda conditional kindness? Well? Are you gonna let me buy some booze with this or not? <br>
<br>
You say, 'You can buy booze.'<br>
<br>
Bondl Felligan suddenly becomes completely sober and says, 'Very well, shaman, please come with me.' <br>
<br>
After this you can follow him to the Jade Tiger's Den or just go there yourself. Head up to the third floor, middle room and go inside. There you'll find a greater spirit waiting. <br>
<br>
NOTE: After giving him the gem once, simply going up to him and saying &quot;You can buy booze&quot; at anytime will cause the spirit to spawn in the room. No need to travel back to Ocean of Tears, Field of Bones, Rathe Mountains or Butcherblock Mountains to initiate the quest again.<br>
<br>
Once you arrive at the Jade Tiger's Den . . . <br>
You say, 'Hail a greater spirit'<br>
a greater spirit says 'Greetings, shaman. Tell me, do you follow [Justice], [War], [Fear], or [Hate]?<br>
Answer appropriately depending upon whether you are:<br>
Barbarian [Justice], Ogre [War], Iksar [Fear], or Troll [Hate].<br>
<br>
What follows is the Barbarian response . . . <br>
You say, 'I follow justice'<br>
<br>
a greater spirit says 'Ah, a follower of the Tribunal from the North you are, then. You would be best served by speaking to my brother in the next room. Farewell . <br>
<br>
Go to the other room as instructed by a greater spirit. <br>
You say, 'Hail a greater spirit'<br>
a greater spirit says 'It is good to see you. We're glad you trusted in our brother and did what was asked regardless of Bondl's intentions. This fills us with joy, as the [true spirits] work in  ways most people would not understand and [trust] is the first lesson of the [Heyokah]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What true spirits?'<br>
a greater spirit says 'As a shaman, spirits are known to you. They aid you if you pay them homage and respect the world around you. They also will bend to your will if you are powerful enough. We are a part of the entire universe and we exist because people believe and feel us. However [very few] know us in this form. To mortals we are but ideas, [wisps of consciousness] in an expanse of emptiness and as difficult to grasp as breath in Everfrost. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What trust do you speak of?'<br>
a greater spirit says 'Trust is the glue of the universe. When one trusts others to do their part, it allows them to focus on what they must do themselves. The trust that others have in us also gives us the confidence to do our parts effectively, thus maintaining harmony. When one becomes dissatisfied with his part and pursues his own desires, this is called greed. And greed destroys the glue of the universe. This is why we wished the bandits under the grass. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What very few?'<br>
 a greater spirit says 'There are only a handful of mortals we've judged worthy to be friends and, reluctantly, masters. We call them the [Heyokah]. Bondl is one of them and he helps to test those we believe might be able to grasp our existence. There are many troubles that threaten us and our home. We seek those with the wisdom, patience, and might to help us ensure the health of the cosmos. Whether you seek balance or personal power, this is important to you. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What wisps of consciousness?'<br>
a greater spirit says 'It is difficult for mortals to grasp what we are for we are not material that can be held or consumed. We are the spirit that drives beings to do what beings do. The wolf lives to run and hunt. When you ask for his aid, his spirit enters your body and you 'become' wolf. The ox is the personification of endurance and when he enters your body, you do not become an ox, you become all that is ox. I myself am the spirit of understanding. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What heyokah?'<br>
The greater spirit should give you the gem after you say the above line.<br>
a greater spirit says 'The Heyokah are our mortal counterparts. Some are our friends who seek to help us in whatever goals we deem important. Some seek nothing more than to enslave and command us to do their bidding. We accept this and often make deals with those we realize are powerful enough to accomplish what needs to be done. To judge such individuals, we have prepared a test. We ask that before we enter into these contracts, the shaman walk the [path of the Heyokah]. We see you may be worthy. Will you walk the path? You will be rewarded for your efforts, albeit grudgingly. <br>
<br>
CAUTION: DO NOT say the following line until you receive the gem by saying the above line. The next line will cause him to immediately despawn but will start the next quest for you. <br>
<br>
You say, 'I will walk the path of the Heyokah'<br>
a greater spirit says 'That is good. You will need to walk three paths before you can reach that of the Heyokah. The paths of patience, wisdom, and might. First, you must learn patience. Take this gem and go on a pilgrimage to an island in the great water the wasichu call Erud's Crossing. The Kerrans there are our allies and can show you to our next contact, Ooglyn. Give Ooglyn the gem and do what she asks. As you walk the path, remember what you've learned about trust. <br>
<br>
The Test of Patience<br>
<br>
Head to Erud's Crossing. Find Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman, on the island. Approx. loc -900, 1600. She should be up, if not her spawn time is 2 hours. <br>
<br>
Preparation:<br>
Bind on the Island or Qeynos Have SoW, Levitation and Enduring Breath up and running. Have your pet spell ready to cast. Have gate or evac, if wizard/druid in group, ready to cast.<br>
<br>
Minimum Levels Required (more is better):<br>
Solo: 49+ Shaman &amp; pet (or even lower using Inviso to Animals) Duo: Two 44+ Shamans &amp; pets Group: Well balanced high 30's or better.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Ooglyn'<br>
Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, shaman . Me's been waitin for you cuz our frenz say you comin an need da test. So's I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me put it? Ooglyn been waiting for sign for so long dat me forget where me put test. Keep your eyes out for sign while me look for test. Oh, hey, shaman, they gib you gem? I need dat gem, please, heheh. <br>
<br>
Give her the gem. <br>
Ooglyn says 'Ahhh, tank you, now me can...OH LOOK!! DA SIGN!!!! Oh, sorry you missed it. The sign show you where to wait for da test. Follow me...I like you so I take you there. We goin for a swim, shaman! <br>
After Ooglyn finishes casting spells, she starts to run away. Follow her until she disappears into the water. Then run out over the water (make sure you have levitation and some sort of underwater breathing on) and head to loc -1600, +4200. Dive down about 10 feet into the water and cast your pet spells. Then proceed to the bottom of the ocean and wait patiently as this test suggests.<br>
<br>
Ooglyn may be waiting there for you there or she may not. If she's not there, no worries. It won't effect the quest. <br>
Patiently wait at that location. Five different spirits or Heyokah will eventually spawn. Be patient. Your goal is to receive &quot;a broken arrow&quot; from Abe, and a &quot;gem&quot; from the Greater Spirit. As such, only the conversations with Abe and the Greater Spirit are presented here. Conversations with the others is merely &quot;fluff&quot;. Did I mention patience?<br>
<br>
Invisibility to Animals: Several have reported that using Invisibility to Animals while waiting will keep the sharks from attacking you.<br>
NOTE: You will also have to fend off the regular Sharks and the much tougher Killer Sharks that roam the area while you wait UNLESS you keep Invisibility to Animals up constantly.<br>
TIP: Despite what ANY of the spirits or Ooglyn say to you, DO NOT leave this location. They are only trying to trick you. Remember, this is about Patience.<br>
<br>
Now then, once you are at the bottom of the ocean at neg 1600 pos 4200 . . . <br>
You say, 'Hail Abe the Abandoned'<br>
Abe the Abandoned turns his head slowly toward you but his eyes never come into focus. You can't tell if he's looking at you, behind you, or right in front of his own face. Then ,suddenly, he shouts at the top of his lungs, 'HOOOOKAAAHEEEEYYYY! I AM [ABE]!' <br>
You say, 'Who are you abe?'<br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Nothing is hidden. All is discernible if you only know where to look and you have the right [eyes]. Don't be angry with me if you can't get your eyes right to see what you're looking for. I'd lend you mine but I don't wear the same size. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What eyes?'<br>
Abe the Abandoned begins to draw a picture in the mud with his finger although it doesn't seem to make any sense at all. He points to his picture and nods approvingly at you, saying, 'You see? The curtains fell and it was naught but a dream upon a landscape that we thought we knew. The dream of the [Combine] fulfilled when we finally trimmed our fingernails and looked into the mud. And now we are abandoned, in a world that none can see, no one has the eyes.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is the combine?'<br>
Abe the Abandoned shakes his head in amusement and says, 'Heheheh, yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you? But I guess not' <br>
After a few minutes, Abe will speak again. Be patient! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Abe the Abandoned says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I will never see our friends again. But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow. Shaman, will you bear our obligation and [give them the arrow]? You will know who to give it to when it is time. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Yes i will give them the arrow'<br>
Abe the Abandoned removes a quiver slung across his shoulder and solemnly hands it to you without a word. <br>
A few minutes later . . . <br>
Abe the Abandoned suddenly gasps and says, 'I have found it! I know the answer! Come with me and I will tell you. Eyes are everywhere and this knowledeg is not for everyone. Finally my centuries of waiting are over hahahaha! Follow me Shaman! <br>
<br>
Stay glued to that spot. DO NOT follow him <br>
After or before Abe spawns, a greater spirit also spawns . . .<br>
<br>
a greater spirit begins to cast a spell.<br>
a greater spirit's body pulses with energy.<br>
You say, 'Hail a greater spirit'<br>
a greater spirit says 'You have walked the path of patience and you now know what to expect. We are watchers. Our eyes are everywhere and we must be patient and quiet else we may miss what could be harmful. Can you sit still quietly and wait for just the right moment, then open your eyes with a fury and act with all the energy you have cultivated? Timing is everything, and without patience you cannot be sensitive to timing. You have shown your patience here and we believe you are ready to walk the [next path]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is the next path?'<br>
a greater spirit says 'You know trust and patience. But before we can allow you to act in our name, we must know that when you do decide to act, you will make the right choices. We must ask that you now walk the path of wisdom. You must walk to the great plains and search out one of us. He is a wanderer, and it is his nature to drift with the winds and weather doing what he can to ensure understanding and longevity to all that respect their home. He will not be easy to find, though, and you must remember what you have learned down here to succeed in finding him. When you do, give him this gem and follow his instructions.<br>
<br>
You will receive a &quot;small gem&quot;<br>
<br>
The Test of Wisdom<br>
<br>
Head to West Karana. Look for a wandering spirit (looks exactly like a wisp). <br>
TIP: You can stand at neg 500 neg 5300 in West Karana and he will path by you. I've now done this twice and never waited more than 20 - 30 min tops. He will also path by Tower 2, actually colliding with it on his journey. Just keep looking around so he doesn't slip by you. . . . - Belgar<br>
<br>
Once spotted, run up to him and Hail him repeatedly at close range to get him to stop moving.<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail a wandering spirit'<br>
a wandering spirit stops and flashes brightly for a moment. It seems to be regarding you with interest. <br>
<br>
Give the &quot;small gem&quot; to the wandering spirit. <br>
a wandering spirit says 'Oh, it is you, shaman! Good! You must hurry before it's too late. Go now to the Mountains they call Rathe and find them! They need your help quickly! They will know you when they see you and instruct you on how you can help, but you must hurry! Your <br>
<br>
Head to Rathe Mountains. You'll find Tabien the Goodly (approx level 32) at loc pos 6300, pos 1550. If you talk to him, the conversation is as follows:<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Tabien the Goodly'<br>
Tabien the Goodly says 'Oh thank Marr you are here, Waring . I was beginning to think I would be abandoned in my time of need. I have a [task] for you to complete in the name of my patron Mithaniel Marr. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What task?'<br>
Tabien the Goodly display his shield that must once have been shining and regal but is now scoured in cuts, dents, and chipped paint. He says, 'This shield is known as Marr's Promise. It is a sacred relic that was actually used by one of Mithaniel's angels on the Plane of Valor. Its value to our church is immeasurable and I have been charged with the protection of it. However, a patriarch of the false god, Bertoxxulous, is after my shield and me. He must be stopped! Please, destroy him and bring me proof of his death. <br>
<br>
The other one is Glaron the Wicked (approx level 32), his loc is pos 2900, neg 1900. If you talk to him, the conversation is as follows:<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Glaron the Wicked'<br>
Glaron the Wicked says 'Are you the one they sent to help our cause? I should have known they would send a green witch doctor to serve Bertoxxulous and myself. Very well, you will have to suffice. I have a [task] you must fulfill if you wish to know the blessing of my god and impress your masters.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What task?'<br>
Glaron the Wicked brandishes a long, wicked-looking bone dagger and there is a horrid, diseased stench as soon as he unsheathes it. He draws another blade, shorter and wider than the first, of blackened bone with a larger than normal hilt, obviously for defense. He says, 'This festering blade is called Woe, and this scorched one is called Envy. They were created on the Plane of Decay by Bertoxxulous' own hands. He has judged me worthy of the protection of such holy relics. However, there is one in these very mountains who seeks to destroy these relics. End this idiot follower of Marr's life and bring me proof.' <br>
<br>
Now both these guys are fools, what do we do with fools? We kill them. Take their items (Envy, Woe and Marr's Promise) back to West Karana and give all three to the wandering spirit at the same time.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Conversation with Glaron and Tabien is not required to finish the quest. You may, if you wish, simply kill them outright.<br>
<br>
 wandering spirit says 'You are close to passing the test, keep up the good work.<br>
a wandering spirit says 'It is unfortunate that it came to this, but nothing else was to be done. Both paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items given to them. The mere protection of these material belongings was not as important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they act with righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this and acted accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three treasures made into one to ward off the falsehood of possession, the [Shield of Falsehood]. You have walked the<br>
 path and now, as your final test, we must set you along one [last path].<br>
<br>
You say, 'What shield of falsehood?'<br>
a wandering spirit says 'Yes, I have taken Marr's Promise along with Woe and Envy and fashioned them together to create the Shield of Falsehood. Wield this in defense of posession and the weakness that comes with hoarding treasure instead of using it to accomplish your goals. May it serve you well, Barbarian.<br>
<br>
Congratulations. You have now received ...<br>
Shield of Falsehood<br>
AC16 STR+3, WIS+5, INT+5, DEX-3, CHA-5, MANA+30<br>
<br>
You say, 'What last path?'<br>
a wandering spirit says 'You have trusted us along the paths we have set before you. You have been known to be patient and await the right moment. And now, you have learned the wisdom to act in our best interest. However, one last path awaits, to determine if you have the ability to act out what must be done. There are many troubles about the world we try to rub out but none is more serious than the curse on what the wasichu call the Emerald Jungle. Go there and find one of our spirits. Show them the gem you have been given and follow the path they set you on.<br>
<br>
The Test of Might<br>
<br>
Head to loc +1250, +300 in Emerald Jungle. There you'll find the Sentinel Spirit. <br>
Hail him and give him the gem you received from the wandering spirit. <br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahh, you live, shaman! I am glad the beasts of this jungle haven't torn your body asunder. Tell me, do you still walk the path? Are you willing to [continue what you have started]? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I will continue what i have started'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'This brings happiness to our hearts and we are grateful. However, we must ask you to walk one more path before you can become a true Heyokah. With trust, one can focus on what is important. With patience, one can perceive what is harmful. With wisdom, one can know what must be done. These, you have learned, yet without the might to carry out what must be done, all is for naught. Are you [prepared to walk the path of might]? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I am prepared to walk the path of might'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Good, good, Do you know this place, Waring , this forest? The wasichu call it the Emerald Jungle, but we know it only as the terrible place. Where there is no spirituality, we are weak. The lost city in the middle of this jungle is a great void of belief not only absent of spirituality, but actually draining it from others. We are here to neutralize that void. The void is like the sky, and nothing escapes its gaze. If it senses us, it will drain us away and sometimes it turns our minds, making us [like the wasichu], crazy for things with no meaning. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What like the wasichu?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, there are some of us who have turned their backs on our world and struggle for possesions and power over others. These lost ones are our brothers and we cry for them. Our hearts are in pain like bleeding wounds when we think of them. The path of might will lead you to one of our lost brothers. We are afraid there is nothing we can do for him now, so you must eliminate him when you [find him]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'How do i find him?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'He left us long ago and walked the land for ages. He soon met a man, one of the pointy-ears that live underground. This man was like a void just liike the one over that terrible place now. Our Brother-Friend was attracted to this man's desire and ambition. He no doubt thought that he could get what he wanted in service of this [dark point ear] who denied his own creator. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What dark point ear?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'After our brother began traveling with this point-ear, they became shrouded in a darkness we could not peer through. The point-ear was a powerful being and we soon lost their trail. We have no idea where he could be now. Although, after all these centuries, he has no doubt been gathering and cultivating his wealth and power. He must be an incredibly influential being at this point. Find this point-ear and draw our brother out, then destroy him and bring us proof. We await your return in somber mourning. <br>
<br>
Head to Mistmoore. Find the wolf spirit, Black Dire. He is STRONG and he has 4 slighty weaker wolves as his four guardians. Black Dire hits hard and fast for up to 200 HP per swipe, so use extreme caution.<br>
Black Dire is not a timed spawn, but you can kill the Advisor in the general vicinity of the Library (location 19 on EQAtlas map) and Black Dire will repop each time you do so.<br>
Black Dire is by the ramp leading up to the castle but you don't go up ramp. Instead, head all the way up the canyon that passes under the bridge. At base of cliff you will see 4 wolfs and Black Dire in the middle.<br>
In order to get a response from the wolf you have to con Warmly. He is truespirit faction. When you walk up to him and hail him this is what he says:<br>
Black Dire says 'So, you've come. I suppose my brothers have sent you to lead me back to heir flock. Those fools are so blinded by their devotion they know nothing of life. If they only knew the power I've become, the luxuries I've amassed, the pleasures I've known, they too would leave that sour and unrewarding existence in seconds. You know, you could come to know what I have, shaman. You found me, which speaks of your intelligence; we could use you. What do you say, Waring ? [Will you join] my master Mayong Mistmoore? <br>
<br>
You say, 'I will NOT join you'<br>
Black Dire says 'Good shaman, now bare your neck that I may show our master your devotion in death. The more blood you spill upon the grass, the more impressed our Lord Mistmoore will be. Then maybe, just maybe, you will be allowed to scour our kitchen floors in the eternity of unlife. TEAR him to pieces, my wolves! <br>
Once you kill Black Dire, loot his pelt.<br>
<br>
Return to the Sentinel Spirit in Emerald Jungle, loc +1250, +300.<br>
You say, 'Hail Spirit Sentinel' <br>
Spirit Sentinel begins to weep softly as he sees the pelt, battered and bloody. After a few moments, he says, 'We can only hope his passing was quick and painless. The Dire was powerful and yet you overcame him. Always remember that when you became [Heyokah], it was the passing of a noble, yet misguided being that allowed you to do so. You should hold a special place in your heart for him and what he was in life. To help you remember him, we will fashion this pelt into a pair of boots and give them to you. With every step you take, you must think on the Dire, else his death be in vain forever.' <br>
<br>
Congratulations! You have now receieved:<br>
Black Fur Boots AC 9, Str+3 Sta+3 Wis+3 Agil+3 SV Dis +3 Sv Mag+5 sv Poi+3<br>
Effect: Instantaneous, Manaless, Self-SoW <br>
<br>
You say, 'What is heyokah?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Yes, you have walked the Path of the Heyokah to its end. You have ecome what few have and we will now call to you as Heyokah Duhara . From now on, you are a direct link between the spirits and man. Whether your goals are to help us or master us, you are welcomed. Though there is little time for celebration. Do you feel the darkness of this place, the forest? To eyes not trained to see beyond physical appearances, it seems like any other forest. But you know, as do we, of the mantle over the city threatening all of us. We must [rub it out]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'How can we rub it out?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'There are many such mantles scarring the universe and each is very different from the last. Removing them requires that we learn how they were created and go about reversing the damage done. We cannot enter under the mantle for long which is why we search out Heyokah such as yourself. We need you to enter the city and find out what you can about the [city's demise]. We hope you will do this for the cause of balance but if you desire none but your own power, we shall grant that as well<br>
<br>
You say, 'What about the city's demise?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'It was known as Torsis. During its history it amassed great wealth and power yet it eventually crumbled. No one understands what happened. The men of the world ask themselves how a nation as successful as Torsis could ever fall. Some blame plague, internal unrest, the constant encroachment of the forest, and marauding bands of monsters but we alone know what happened. Just as Tabien and Glaron lost sight of their spiritual paths, so did Torsis. Without the awe and inspiration of that which was greater than themselves, they eventually withered away. The mantle was born long before the last days, though, and what we need to learn is [how it all began]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Tell me how it all began'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Excellent! Go into the city and gather what evidence you can. The ghosts who still walk the streets may hoard precious memories that will aid us. Take this booklet and combine what you find in it. Then bring me the completed report. From there, we will know where to look next.<br>
<br>
The City of Mist Reports<br>
You must now acquire the following six reports from the City of Mist. Five of the six messages drop from skeletons, golems and goos at the zone, but the Student's Log is only found on a Spectral Courier.<br>
<br>
Personal Diary Page, identifies as &quot;Report Information 1 of 6&quot; in Lizardman. It reads: <br>
Crier's Scroll, identifies as &quot;Report Information 2 of 6&quot; in lizardman. It reads: <br>
Merchant's Letter, identifies as &quot;Report Information 3 of 6&quot; in lizardman. It reads: <br>
Written Annoucement, identifies as &quot;Report Information 4 of 6&quot;. It reads: <br>
Priest's Diary Page, identifies as &quot;Report Information 5 of 6&quot; in lizardman. It reads: <br>
Student's Log, identifies as &quot;Report Information 6 of 6&quot; in Lizardman. It reads: <br>
<br>
After placing the 6 report pages in the Booklet, hit combine and return the combined Booklet to the Sentinel Spirit at loc +1250, +300 in Emerald Jungle. <br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail Spirit Sentinel'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Ahhh good, let us hope what you have found will point us in the right direction. Hmmm...this is interesting. It appears the disappearance of the first queen may have caused Rak'Ashiir's faith to decline. From there, the first King Rak laid down the groundwork for the city's eventual demise. We need to learn what happened to the queen. Perhaps bringing this knowledge to the King's now cursed form will lift the mantle. We've learned that the last lord of Torsis, Ghiosk, was a bit of a historian. Find him and see what you can learn about the queen. Take what you find to my brother here In the jungle beneath the murky waters of a pond. <br>
<br>
The Three Books of Lord Ghiosk<br>
You must kill Lord Ghiosk in the City of Mist and bring the three books drops to a Spirit at loc: +3685, -640 in Emerald Jungle. Reports indicate he's no slouch, so bring 3 full groups of your uber friends (level 55 +) to the party.<br>
<br>
The Three Books Lord Ghiosk drops (accurate Iksar translation):<br>
Book 1 <br>
Book 2 - Keeper of the House's Log<br>
Book 3 <br>
<br>
Bring the three books Lord Ghiosk drops to a Spirit at loc: +3685, -640 in Emerald Jungle.<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Hmmm, it appears the queen's disappearance wasn't as random as we thought. It also looks as if this High Scale were having some sort of affair with Neh. We have little but speculation at this point, so making it known to Nak'Ashiir would do nothing. Perhaps finding the resting place of the High Scale will show us more of what really happened. We suspect the icon mentioned in this log could now be located in the city's old temple. Find the icon and bring it to Kirn, wherever he is. Tell us what you learn afterwards. <br>

<br>
Obtaining the High Scale Icon<br>
Go into City of Mist.<br>
Go across the bridge. <br>
Open the gate. <br>
Turn right. <br>
Go straight forward through 2 arches. <br>
In the last room you will find a temple with a waterfall running down its side. <br>
Stay in that courtyard of temple, and pull skeletons, etc., from the first door you see at the base of the temple. <br>
Open the door. Inside is another door directly in front of you, do not open this door, it leads to top of temple. Look instead to the right, where three skeletons spawn. Pull these skeletons to courtyard and kill them. <br>
<br>
Go back into door, head right and ye will see a room set below ground level with three phantoms in it, standing on a raised dais. Pull and kill these phantoms. There are two doors beside the dais, one opening to the left and one opening to the right. Choose the left door. Inside is a small room with no monsters inside, and a small bag on the floor in the left corner. Click on the bag, you now have the High Scale Icon. Gate out. <br>
<br>
Using Invisibility to Undead potion (Unlife Awareness) will get you past the last three skeletons and phantoms. They will still scowl at you, ready to attack, but it is a bluff. They will NOT be able to see you. <br>
Be warned, however, as the golems of the area can see through Invisibility to Undead, and you may run across a couple on the way to the temple area. <br>
There were no rogue-locked doors between the zone and the High Scale icon.<br>
<br>
High Scale Kirn<br>
Proceed to The Hole near Paineel on Erud. Bring 3 groups of uber pals with you (level 55+). High Scale Kirn is located in the Tower BEYOND the City in The Hole.<br>
Kirn's Respawn Time: 4 Hours<br>
<br>
Once you get to High Scale Kirn, give him the High Scale Icon:<br>
<br>
WARNING: DO NOT use Form of the Great Bear while doing this. reports that handing Kirn the Icon in Bear Form will BUG the quest causing him to NOT agro and NOT drop Neh's Promise Ring!<br>
<br>
High Scale Kirn looks down at the icon in his hands for a long moment before speaking. 'Why did you bring me this? Are you here to accuse me of the queen's death?' High Scale Kirn chuckles venomously and continues, 'I am High Scale and beyond your petty laws. However, I wish the truth to be known. On my hand is a ring. If you can take it from me, show it to the queen and she will remember. However, I will not give up the ring easily. Defend yourself!'<br>
NOTE: Kirn is initially non-agro to all, but will AGRO IMMEDIATELY the instant you hand him the Icon, so you may not see the above conversation fly by, or it's possible the conversation has been removed. Just hand him the Icon and then kill him. No conversation is necessary.<br>
After Killing High Scale Kirn, he drops: <br>
Engraved Ring MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>
CHA: +5 Identifies as: Item Lore: Promise Ring of Neh`Ashiir.<br>
<br>
Kirn's Ring, Neh's Diary, Iksar Child's Tear, Lord Rak's Scale and . . . . The Spear of Fate<br>
<br>
Kirn's Ring<br>
Return to the City of Mist and give Kirn's Ring to Neh'Ashiir<br>
Neh`Ashiir says 'Nothing is left to hide now. You shall have the truth. But truth is not won easily and if you cannot defeat me, you have not the ability to see that vengeance is served. Brace yourself!<br>
NOTE: Neh is initially non-agro to all, but will AGRO IMMEDIATELY the instant you hand her the Ring, so you may not see the above conversation fly by, or it's possible the conversation has been removed. Just hand her the Ring and kill then kill her. No conversation is necessary.<br>
<br>
Neh's Diary<br>
Kill Neh'Ashiir and loot her Diary<br>
<br>
Give Neh' Ashiir's Diary to the Spirit Sentinel Wolf at loc: +3685, -640 in Emerald Jungle<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you do not give Neh's Diary to the Spirit Sentinel before proceeding to give the Child's Tear to Lord Rak (see below), you may not have sufficient True Spirit faction to trigger Lord Rak and may not receive the Iksar Scale needed to acquire your Spear of Fate, requiring you to make another trip to the Plane of Fear and secure another Child's Tear from the Golem-spawned Broodling.<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'So, the truth is found! Rak mourned over the loss of his child instead of relishing the blessing of his god, Cazic-Thule. His wife and the High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the child to rest, Rak may repent of what he has done and the mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to Rak. I can feel the mantle's foundation crumbling! Now, go! <br>
<br>
Iksar Child's Tear<br>
Proceed to the Plane of Fear and slay the Iksar Child. <br>
The Iksar Child is a level one broodling. However, you must kill a Golem to get the Child to spawn.<br>
TIP: If your guild is not Fear-ready, try to get into any Fear Raid offering your buffing services, perhaps even foregoing looting rights in exchange for dibs on the Tear.<br>
<br>
Lord Rak's Scale <br>
Return to City of Mist and give the Tear to Lord Rak' Ashiir.<br>
NOTE: If you do not give Neh's Diary to the Spirit Sentinel before proceeding to give the Child's Tear to Lord Rak (see above), you may not have sufficient True Spirit faction to trigger Lord Rak's agro and may not receive the Iksar Scale needed to acquire your Spear of Fate, requiring you to make another trip to the Plane of Fear and secure another Child's Tear from the Golem-spawned Broodling.<br>
<br>
Lord Rak' Ashiir is initially non-agro to all, but if you have sufficient True Spirit faction he will AGRO IMMEDIATELY when you turn in the Child's Tear, so be fully prepped and ready to fight!<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT CAUTION: Lord Rak hits with a 2000 hp area affect spell! Recommended 3 mage fire pets works nicely. Once Rak has spawned from the Reaver:<br>
<br>
1) Park the questing shaman and the mage fire pets around Lord Rak<br>
2) Move the rest of the raiding party to the opposite side of the room.<br>
3) Questing shaman hands Lord Rak the Tear. Rak will AGRO IMMEDIATELY, use his AOE on you (likely killing you), but also agroing the Fire Pets on him.<br>
4) Have party stay back and watch the show while healers keep the Fire Pets healthy. If other mobs pop, the party can attack them, but be sure you DO NOT use AOE on those mob pops to avoid agroing Rak on the party.<br>
5) The quest shaman should not move toward raid party, but rather stand there and try to heal yourself. You'll probably die quickly from the AOE. Have a cleric resurrect you back as soon as possible, loot the &quot;Iksar Scale&quot; and get party out. We fought our way back to zone, but evac works as well of course.<br>
<br>
The Spear of Fate<br>
Take the &quot;Iksar Scale&quot; to the Spirit Sentinel Wolf at loc: +3685, -640 in Emerald Jungle.<br>
NOTE: The following conversation is not necessary. You may, if you wish, simply hand the Iksar Scale to the Spirit Sentinel and receive your Spear of Fate.<br>
<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented his mistake? But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he was the one who initiated its construction. But is its initiation the key? How could we have been so blind? Kirn said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands but that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that would lead them to destruction. It was the people who chose to follow.<br>
<br>
You say, 'What is lost?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of thousands of faithless individuals. Not the single shroud we believed existed. Torsis is now truly cursed for all eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of this. Your sacrifice and spiritual devotion in this matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at the bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis and entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward you with our greatest treasure, the [Spear of Fate]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the Spear of Fate?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah. One of the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he is known, had been traveling the world searching out all known magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all forms of dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of negative spiritual energy similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into existence one of these [black holes]. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of these Black Holes?<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the frigid northlands to experiment in solitude. It was here that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for the small tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this new black hole threatened not only their livelihood but their entire existence. The mantle was so powerful it not only drained the spiritual energy of everything within its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But one [powerful shaman] stepped forward and struck against Miragul's mantle. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What powerful shaman?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the [cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an aviak elder. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the cosmos?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force brought into existence. This force was positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked like a void, it was still created by an imposition of will. We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could even get close to it. In one act of devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a [breach] across the planes. <br>
<br>
You say, 'What of the breach?'<br>
Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of existence created enough negative material to cancel out Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself was lost in the process. All that was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it. When you strike with it, you must have the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he defeated Miragul's mantle. Thank you, Heyokah. <br>
<br>
Congratulations, Heyokah! You have received your Spear of Fate!:<br>
