<br>
Good to see somebody follows the quake community. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ive for the most part retired from Quake since the release of Q3. However my clan did continue on with Q3 and as expected is doing quite well. <br>
<br>
As for not being &quot;on top of the game&quot; in regards to EQ well that really depends on ones definition of that. For some its being in uber guilds and having as much phat loot as they can possibly get, for others is sitting in EC peddling their treasures off to the highest bidder. Some might find enjoyment from just working as a team to accomplish certain goals.<br>
<br>
As for me, well I guess I would fit in the latter. I really dont care to much for phat lewts unless it comes to a point where it greatly impacts my performance, then i have to upgrade a bit. I dont think I could spend hours on end in EC trading like a frenzied stock broker. So yeah, I guess for me its the teamwork and strategy thats involved with being in a guild. Heh, I like to think of EQ as an graphical IRC client with some killing on the side. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I just mostly play for fun. Its only a game after all... <br>

2. Yaen and Yandros were both told while VS was still alive that the rotation was in effect and it was IB turn.  There was no confusion here.  They both totally understood what was happening.  Both of them told me, we are only doing what our guild leader told us to do, nothing we can do about it.<br>
<br>
Also, Yaen said to me "I can't just tell all these people to leave now"<br>

He did understand that there was a rotation and they were going to FFA on VS.<br>
<br>
The guilds that want a rotation are not telling anyone to join us.  All we are doing is using our combined efforts to make sure we win at FFA.  Perhaps in time FFA won't look so attractive to those that want it. <p><center><img src=http://yourpage.blazenet.net/anabelle/triad/valas6.jpg hieght=270 width=216></center><BR>

Aaki = Eyee<br>
<br>
Yandros is NOT Aaki<br>
Yandros is NOT Eyee<br>
<br>
and to you that are conveniently forgetting<br>
there WAS a period of time that people were saying VS will/is/was/will-be/etc FFA<br>
AND this time happened to be AFTER we were assigned to the NOW-non-existant, etc. rotation<br>
<br>
<br>
in other words<br>
if it was clear to *everyone* (because that is what it takes to actually have a rule) that VS was on rotation, then we would have followed rotation<br>
HOWEVER. it obviously was not clear to everyone. and Eyee decided we would kill it when it spawned. had he heard new news that it had gone back to rotation, we could have followed it.<br>
<br>
and this talk about Mr. Valas making it clear to everyone?<br>
yes, you sent me tells saying it was rotation?<br>
but i have absolutely no clue about server politics. this is the Second time i've actually read stuff here, and am just learning about this crap and had no idea who you were telling me to leave VS spawn alone<br>
some random /tell telling me i shouldn't kill a mob &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; my guild leader scheduling a raid<br>
so sorry if i don't listen to every random /tell talking server politics. i'm not even an officer in my guild. i don't make decisions. and i didn't know any of the politics<br>
maybe if you would have talked to an officer or someone that knew what was going on?<br>
naw you just assume that everyone in every guild reads all your posts and knows you're the leader of the Coilition of Guilds Alliance Formed to Make All the Decisions for the Luclin Playerbase and will do whatever it is you /tell them with<br>
<br>
oh, by the way. i appreciate the threats you made in /tells<br>
how you assured me it would be my last VS's i probably ever saw?<br>
this is mighty fine way to earn respect and convince someone btw<br>
just let em know you intend on &quot;KS&quot;ing me from here-on-out for something i didn't even know was going on<br>

I spoke to you because several in your guild when I did a /who all ancient told me you were running the raid.  It seemed prudent to talk to the raid leader.<br>
<br>
I made no threats, I only stated the facts, that would be the last VS in which AC would see for some time if they broke the rotation.  It saddens me that you could not see the logic in that.<br>

By being two-faced and agreeing to enter the rotation only to KS a brethren guild, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> asked for and got FFA.  Your leadership's idiocy still astounds me btw.<br>
<br>
The guilds that worked gracefully in the context of the VS rotation want it to continue.  In order to make it possible, Valas is saying that the guilds in the current rotation will use combined forces to &quot;FFA the spawn&quot; as much as we can (yes, it seems FFA is a verb in luclin).<br>
<br>
If you engage VS and kill him before:<br>
<br>
- Endoeran<br>
- Heroes<br>
- Insidious Blood<br>
- Triad Continuum<br>
- Sacred Sanctuary<br>
- Veil of Shadows<br>
<br>
can mobilize to kill him, grats to you.  Sounds fun to have all but two of the most powerful guilds on the server lined up against you, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
However, I'm willing to bet that by your actions AC won't get a VS for another month at least through sheer FFA.  Bets have been wrong before though, so who knows (exhibit A: &quot;LoS is a sinking ship&quot; -- Wang circa 2000)<br>
<br>
As for the people that say FFA is better than a rotation that you can enter reasonably easily, I guess you are not the type that enjoys the prospect of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> guaranteed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> spawns on regular dates.<br>

it is not a threat<br>
it is simply the facts<br>
it's not a threat tho i promise!!!<br>
don't you see my logic? not a threat! just facts. good<br>
*sigh*<br>
<br>
you sure did talk to the raid leader<br>
but maybe other guilds have someone besides the officers/leaders of the guild running the raids as well<br>
<br>
maybe we can chalk it up to a learning experience and you can admit you talked to the wrong person and can understand why what happened happened besides calling us KS'ers and how bad our leadership is and how much we're ruining our rep because we haven't kept up-to-date on the politics for whatever reasons<br>
and we can admit that we did not have great communication with the overseerers of the &quot;community&quot; and believed it was FFA so we killed it. and now recognize that it is once again on a rotation. however silly rotating this mob to keep multi-guild raids and non-guild-friends from obtaining such nice risk vs reward loot may be.<br>
<br>
<br>
and next time<br>
just ask me if there's any officers online that know something about the rotation of VS and it's details instead of threatening me with FFA'ing (for the good/right people!) away from AC<br>

It provides a method for everyone to have a chance.  Anyone that doesn't think rotation is the best system should really think about what FFA means in most cases on mobs that people really want to kill.<br>
<br>
Let's take Ragefire for instance. A really great system has been set up.   It is a type of reservation system in order to maximize the number of Cleric epics on the server.   IMHO it is great.   I mean can you imagine Ragefire as FFA?  8 guilds in there attempting to all kill Ragefire at the same time.  What good would that do.  People agroing a LDC and floating across the lava creates a train like you would never be able to stop. <br>
<br>
Rotations are a way to keep tensions down.  When people are respectful of their fellow servermates then everyone is better off.  It allows people to have lives and plan their schedules and still get to enjoy the game and kill some of the more challenging or interesting mobs. <br>
<br>
Show respect and in turn you will be respected.  <br>
<br>
Work with others and they will work with you.  <br>

Jeez, I read these boards religously at work and I couldnt tell you if there was a rotation or not still in place. <br>
<br>
Could we at least get a Rotation thread like the ragefire thread?<br>
<br>
That way people now what the hell is going on. <br>
<br>
Show which guilds are in the rotation and which guilds are vs capable and have decided to ffa it.<br>
<br>
AC is right in that you need to make the rotation alot clearer if you want it to be server law. People might not like the ragefire list but they could never claim they dont know what is going on with it.<br>
<br>
How many can say that about these rotations. :-/<br>
<br>
Ninja edit:<br>
Also, serv as a requirement to get in is a problem. He works fine for trak but VS is a @#%$ comparitvely. Make the Scalekeeper or something more comparable a test mob for VS.<br>

WE ARE TALKING ABOUT VENRIL SATHIR<br>
now<br>
please have a little foresight on what will happen in a month, two months? six months? and then look how it is today<br>
<br>
today: 8+ guilds in a rotation that 12 people can kill..............<br>
tomarrow: 12+ guilds on a rotation that 12 people can kill............<br>
when SoL comes out: 20+ guilds on a rotation 6 people can kill............?<br>
<br>
why tho should this mob be controlled by a GUILD rotation<br>
why not keep Maestro GUILD rotated?<br>
why not put every mob on a GUILD rotation?<br>
because the top guilds don't care about his loot or they're in a semi-tough place to get to<br>
the whooooole risk vs reward<br>
<br>
it does NOT take a good raid to kill VS anymore. simply stated. yet you keep him on a rotation for the top guilds because of his loot.<br>
you, whether you pretend to be blind and just, are keeping anyone that Could host a VS raid for a multi-guild event away from his spawn<br>
<br>
i remember when LoS would spend a week up in the planes farming gear, so they started making calendars and rules and everyone was pissed because LoS didn't want it because they didn't want to give up their little spot<br>
<br>
now you guys are acting the same way refusing to give up your little spot that you Probably would not even rush to if it WAS FFA and became even Slightly of a hassle to bother with him. BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE PRETENDING TO BE JUST AND FAIR TO EVERYONE. at least LoS and other people admit they're just there because there's a valid risk vs reward reason to be there and no one is contending with them for it<br>
<br>
take a minute, please. to think about how much you and your guild would rush out to kill VS. and how, HONESTLY NOW, much you'd really bother..<br>
the first time you'd probably send someone to watch when he spawns.. after he spawns you may send out a few groups to see if you'll have to compete with him (if and only if you have the # online at the time)<br>
after this happens, and you have enough to go kill him, you set out to go kill him<br>
however, if there is already a significant # of people there for another guild, you'll either back off or keep pushing<br>
whoever feels killing VS is more important will get down first and engage him<br>
once you become the guild that does not feel his very important. you will stop at the part of &quot;see if you'll have to compete with another guild&quot; and not even bother<br>
<br>
after a week, or a month. you will be that guild that does not even care. after another week, or a month, all the guilds will loose track of his spawn time and slowly forget about jumping on the spawn. yet, somehow, i am sure there will always be at least a group of people assembling to kill him. and i am 99% sure no two groups will engage him at the same time.<br>
<br>
<br>
now, the closest mob in-game currently, that i can think of, to equate this to, is Lodizal<br>
we all know his spawn time (18 hours)<br>
we all know there's the chance we won't get him (he doesn't spawn sometimes)<br>
we all know he drops phat lewtz (yes, you knew that)<br>
we all know he's doable with a group or so (or 3 or 4 if you're a little lower level)<br>
we all know he's easy to get to (except people like me who always forget where those afskj ice pedals are)<br>
<br>
is this mob rotation? nope...<br>
why? several reasons i'm sure<br>
1) LoS isn't going to respect it because if they know he's up, they'll kill him since he's That easy =oP<br>
2) the lower guilds and unguildeds that know how easy he is will complain<br>
3) without a rotation it's harder for you to keep a timer on him<br>
(i'm sure there's a few more but you can add them here + justify them yourself)<br>
<br>
now, #3 takes care of itself<br>
VS being 3 days. you can keep his spawn in the 5pm-10pm time window. and the fact that he doesn't attack people without having to kill a bunch of mobs before you get to him (he's in a dungeon) makes it a little tougher to avoid<br>
#1 being sort of un-avoidable at this point. if LoS wants it, they're going to take it. and currently, i'm sure they wouldn't mind getting a few more shields/masks. but give it a few more months<br>
#2 probably being the kicker. multi-guild organizations and others know how easy lodizal is. and would be very upset if you did not give them a shot<br>
<br>
hopefully. once the smaller raiding groups that are your friends recognize how easy VS is. and how unfair the rotation is treating them, assuming they'd like a shot at his loot (and EC tunnel still says that's a yes!) then you probably won't do anything and keep him for yourselves<br>
and then once your friends ask you.. hey man, VS is so easy, why can't me and my friends take him out? you're not even giving us a shot just because we're not a large guild<br>
<br>
maybe you'll do something about it<br>
<br>
until then<br>
we'll sit in the rotation and /auction our spare legs in EC tunnel right next to you guys to pay for coffins and peridots<br>
<br>
/auction Singing Steel legs, 25kpp (kidding btw)<br>
<br>
sorry about the long post. you guys deserve it. i know you won't read it all anyway. just show us how much you care for the Luclin community! /cheer! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uyaencandyman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yaen Candyman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Werewolf</span><br>  Posts: 342<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/01 7:56:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> start here:<br>
&quot;Show which guilds are in the rotation and which guilds are vs capable and have decided to ffa it.&quot;<br>
<br>
you gotta be out of your mind if you want to keep non-guild organizations out of VS spawn<br>
for all the talk about fairness you do, it's pretty rediculous about how specifically fair you're becoming<br>
<br>
<br>
tell me: WHY should VS be a single-guild-only event or rotation<br>
<br>
i can understand trak because he actually takes decent #s + resist equip + a little listening<br>
but soon there will be the point where this just isn't fair to the people that simply cannot get the drops unless they mooch off a bigger guild, even if they could create a raid to take him out<br>
