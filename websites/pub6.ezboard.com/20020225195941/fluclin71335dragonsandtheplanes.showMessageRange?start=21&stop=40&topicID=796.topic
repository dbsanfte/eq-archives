<br>
 I rarely ever been in group where a warrior didn't have a HELL of a time taking agro off me. Why? Because i am a damage dealing warrior class. I dual weild and cause alot of damage to mobs... If i'm invited to a raid, i better get a shot at the CoF or the RBB if it drops.  Considering looking at everything else, that is the ONLY reason out side helping a friend with an epic id ever go to one of those events. <br>
<br>
I don't know where the hell you get your facts from, but why don't you try and go out and FIND a ranger that has a full set of planar hate armor some time? The ONLY ones that you will find that do are level 60, are in one of the UBER guilds, or has done nothing but spend the last 10 levels in hate raids. Fear armor is CRAP, the only other good armor for a ranger is TOLANS, and you try to find some of the peices for it.<br>
<br>
Ranger armor from fear is rare because people who raid always cut the raid short of where the ranger armor drops. unless by miracle it drops from a chest, theres a one in 10 hate raid chance that any of it will drop... So far in 7 hate raids I have seen a total of 4 peices of ranger armor. I got one in my first raid, the other 3 dropped in one night when the raid was set to do inny...<br>
<br>
All in all, i don't care about the gloves, i got tolans, but the RBB and CoF is something i should as a ranger and productive member of the raid get a chance to get.<br>

Go back to @#%$ 2nd grade please.  1/10 does not equal 4/7.<br>
<br>
Of course a ranger is going to be included for Haste, lol.<br>
<br>
Everybody else, thanks for the input.. still thinking about the bard + haste issue.  I think of it like this.. if I'm doing some very serious fighting, perhaps an uber mob, I sure as hell want all those meleers to be hasted, and if my bard friend whipped out the weapons and started meleeing while we're getting AE'd, nuked, slowed, etc, I'd find a new bard friend that used his instruments more :P<br>
<br>
Day to day fighting, yes, a bard would love some Haste.  Just a matter of deciding whether or not those so hard to get CoF's and RBB's belong in their hands instead of a warriors.<br>

<br>
White Dragon Scale (NONE/QUEST for ALL): Bards only (for epic). If no bards need it then all Wis and Int casters (for the white dragonscale cloak). The cloak has good AC, yes, but all it's stats are really pointing to a caster.<br>
<br>
i cant believe that someone would be so greedy/needy that they would rather stand in the way of someone getting there EPIC for a cloak which granted has good stats but is nothing in comparison to the epic item. if there are no bards present for the item when vox/gore goes down then it should be distributed to someone who is in need for there epic, and I am sure we all know a bard that would love to have it. <br>
<br>
Red Dragon Scale (NONE/QUEST FOR BRD,PAL,RNG,ROG,SHD,WAR): Bards and warriors only for epics. If no bards or warriors need it for their epic, then all who can equip the red dragonscale BP. Honestly though, this is one of the few items I'd rather not reward to somebody as a play-toy because it's hard for many people to get their scales, would probably just try to give it to a guild leader/officer who was in attendence to dish out to a guild member.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
this is what i am talking about, same thing should be said for the white scale.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I know this sounds like a flame but if the roles were reversed , how would it make you feel knowing i had such a MAJOR piece to your epic and kept it for myself which yeilded me a decent stats item , but nothing compared to an EPIC. <br>

Probably only reason I didn't is because:<br>
<br>
A.  The White Dragonscale Cloak is one of the best cloaks in the entire game, whereas the Red Dragonscale Breastplate just plain sucks.<br>
<br>
B.  Especially on an open raid where 30 wis and int casters would die for the cloak, it would be difficult to tell them we were going to save the scale for someone who wasn't even at the raid.<br>
<br>
I do understand where you're coming from and mostly agree, just tough on open raids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uasetwyzerman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aset Wyzerman</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=29870620&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 477<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/01 3:01:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=796.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.luclin.org/files/aset/ISIS.gif width=90 height=45></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dragon loot - opinions please.</span><hr size=1> Personally....I would LOVE a white dragonscale cloak.

<br>
First off, haste items.  In my opinion, warriors, paladins, and shadowknights should get two rolls on CoF and RBB since their epics don't give haste and these are just about the best haste items they will ever get (PoA haste belts are better, but very hard to get for most).  Yes Rangers, rogues and monks should get a shot at 'em too, but their epics are relatively easy to complete and have sick haste on 'em (doh.  monk epic is haste spell.  I'm a goober).  I say treat 'em like the dragon bags you give to monks.  Everyone would use 'em, but monks just get more outta the bags so they get preferrential (sp?) treatment usually.  Also, I don't think bards should be allowed to roll on the haste items really.   Yes they get dual wield; dual wield + double attack = nice.   Dual wield - double attack = crap.  Offhand damage is about 30% of what primary hand damage is, so you will do more damage only double attacking with one weapon then only dual wielding two weapons of the same ratio.  Yes paladins and shadowknights don't get dual wield, but they DO get nice 2 handed weapons and very nice one handers.  Plus, 2 handed weapons have a much higher damage bonus to 'em.  Basically, double attack &gt; dual wield.<br>
<br>
I say the Staff of Forbidden Rights should go to people who are known to do lots of corpse recovery, especially those who have feign death or are rogues.  That staff is very handy if say, a raid gets wiped out by Inny and a gnome rogue needs to sneak to Inny's room on 2nd floor and rez a cleric so the raid can continue, hypothetically speaking of course.  =)<br>
<br>
Orb of Tishan.  I say this should be bard only or randomed between EVERYONE there.  I don't believe any caster when they say they *need* this item, mostly because I see 'em selling them so often in E. Commons.  The only person who will really use this will be a bard since they will actually melee with it.  Maybe.  Otherwise, just let everyone have a chance to sell it in E. Commons since that's what's gonna happen anyhow.<br>
<br>
Bladestopper.  I think all who can use and will use should get a shot at it.  Yes, that includes rogues.  I keep a shield on me at all times.  Why?  I pull alot and also do a lot of corpse recovery.  Extra AC is nice when pulling or when you are draggin' a corpse through Hate and a liche spots you.  Gives you extra time to get to a nice spot to die.  Also, it's the best shield a rogue will ever get, period.  Pallies, Sk's and the rest can use Sarnak Battle Shields which are comparable or better.  Rogues can't.  Heck, just about the best shield a rogue will ever see is that crazy velium round shield and it's only AC 15.  Hehe, anyhow, rogues actually don't take much of a damage penalty from using a shield at all times.  Primary hand and backstab make up around 88% of my damage output, so I'd only lose 12% damage output but would gain a TON of AC and hps.<br>
<br>
As for the scales, I say the white scales go to bards who need for epics without a doubt.  Red dragon scales are a different issue since you there are more sources of red scale.  Thanks to always drop red dragon scales, Scalekeeper in the Hole!<br>
<br>
Crystalline spear should definitely go to a rogue there who needs it and won't go sell it 3 hours later.  If none are there, then again, I say EVERYONE should get to roll on it since I highly doubt any of the other people there who can use it, will.  Crystalline spear with backstab = nice.  Crystalline spear without backstab = heavy, slow, pointed stick that will probably just get sold to a rogue twink.  Before Kunark, the Crystalline spear was the end all, be all rogue weapon really.  Now days, most rogue twinks have better weapons at lvl 20  /rude Trak Tooth.<br>
<br>
ok.  enough of my mad rantings.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Had to fix some junk I foobar'd.  Namely SK / Pallies don't get dual wield not double attack, and monks' epic is haste spell, not item... <p>Sbik Swashbucklugget<br>

<br>
Those naggy gloves are a great resist item.  Therefore all melee should get a shot at it.  That's the only part I'd really disgree with Bish on.<br>
<br>
Here's my 2cps on the hot topics some people have brought up:<br>
<br>
White scale--if someone isn't there at the raid to loot it for their epic that's just tough.  Just because it's rare doesn't mean a bard that wasn't even there should get it.<br>
<br>
--exception: Raid leader decides to reserve it as their item of choice.  Then it's up to the raid leader to give it to a bard in his guild, or a friend, etc.<br>
<br>
Haste items--no bards, sorry.  Two reasons already stated: 1) Bards already have many class specific and epic-related items they can roll on.  2) Bards get self haste song and in the high level game typically operate as buff and mez, not as melee.<br>
<br>
Raid leader reserving one item.  This is fine.  Organizing and leading a raid can be a pain.  This is especially true for raids leaders who repeatedly organize dragons raids to hopefully get themselves an epic-related item. <br>
<br>
One topic not discussed is a level minimum on these dragon raids.  I would say level 47 should be the minimum for Vox and Naggy raids.   Characters lower than that do not contribute enough to a raid to make a difference because they will not resist enough of the dragon fear and cold or fire dragon breath.<br>
<br>
Overall, the raid leader should state the loot rules just prior to the raid.  Latecomers are responsible for finding out the rules.  Don't refer people to some website for loot rules, that's just ridiculous.<br>

<br>
If you don't like the way loot is going to be handled, DON'T GO.<br>
<br>
I think all loot should be discussed before the raid starts (yes I know it's hard on the Naggy pick-up raids) and those who don't agree should have the opportunity to leave before getting too heavily into the raid.<br>
<br>
The last thing you should so is send tells to the raid leader (or who ever is in charge of loot) telling that this should go to this class only, or this class should roll on that, blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
You do that on my raid (not that I lead them anymore) I'll be happy to find a wizzie to invite you and translocate you out.  And if I can't find a wizzie to do it, I'll do it myself.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The bard Epic is the Singing Short Sword, a very uber bard weapon with great stats and a triggered proc that gives the effect Dance of the Blade - a full party buff that adds 55% haste, 30 strength, 30 attack and lasts for 2 minutes and 30 seconds and has a range of about 150 feet.

Fine.  Know what happened?  One of the same people who was telling me I didn't get to roll when we had THREE (3) CoF's drop from Nagafen approached me later and sold me a CoF they got on that raid.  I did not go to them - they came to me.  So much for integrity.<br>
<br>
What is happening here is something very commonly found in EQ - if it doesn't say &quot;Bard only&quot; on it then the bards are told &quot;No, you don't get that because Frank could use it better&quot;. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uaenae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aenae</A> at: 6/1/01 11:49:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ularselum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Larselum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/2/01 12:07:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=796.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dragon loot - opinions please.</span><hr size=1> These rules regarding haste items should only apply to a guild raid (with a guild that believes in them)....not open ones.

It's supposed to be fun.

Heck any class might want to use the COF for it's resist qualities.  Let's let casters roll on it as well.  Intel casters hardly get to roll on any dragon drops anyway.<br>

EDIT: Spelling, oh, and I melee all the time thanks.<br>
<br>
EDIT 2: I can see both sides of the haste argument (in relation to bards), but at 60 with puretone... instruments not gonna do me squat in a short uber-encounter, haste however will do a fair frickin bit (if not only for damage output but for epic proc, proc is group buff if you didn't know).<br>
