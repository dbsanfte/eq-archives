<br>
I post this crap because I think it's fun, and I will post whatever the hell I want within the rules. If there are no rules then guess what? No restraint.<br>
<br>
Now what you end up with, is someone taking into their own hands some type of implied rules. There is not one damn thing in the world that suggests you can't flame in general.<br>
<br>
And for christs sake you know some of the best flames EVER started out in General, so come up with a better argument than that.<br>
<br>
And, for the sake of the record I wasn't trying to belittle anyone, I was not being mean spirited, I was just fuckin' around. <br>
<br>
I still want to know why the VoF one and History one was removed but not the LoM one. Seems kind of one sided to me.<br>
<br>
I will tell you right now, after this shit that if you don't want to spend the rest of your admin career having to delete posts from general, then you had better think about throwing up some rules for the forums and saying what type of content will be moderated. And yes that is a threat, and no there is not one fucking thing you can do to keep me from posting as much as you would like to think that there is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkoak>DarkOak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Blade</span><br>  Posts: 472<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/3/02 12:42:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=876.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Heh</span><hr size=1> If it were up to me I'd ban and delete him.

<br>
You want some guidelines for the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>General</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Forum? How about these.. <br>
<br>
a) Don't post anything you wouldn't want others to post about you. Though that might be self-defeating in your case.<br>
b) Don't post something that will knowingly harm or hurt someone else emotionally (it's possible) in General. But if you know them and they know you (usually same guild) it seems fine. (Use your brain)<br>
c) Do people really have to tell you what you can and cannot do? Or are you capable of thinking and judging for yourself what might be right or wrong?<br>

In other words if you have a healthy level of anarchy inside then you need rules to work with otherwise you will have no grounding and will float off flipping into the atmosphere like a fish in zero gravity.<br>
<br>
On the other hand if you have protean creative urges and you still work within the rules, you physically can't bring yourself to repeat the same old, and as a result end up with something new.<br>

For one thing, if I were banned it would not matter for there are a million EZ Board names and a million IP Addresses I can spoof and you would spend eternity deleting posts and banning names.<br>
<br>
Second, I don't really plan on doing that. I'm trying get the admins to see that if you are going to be deleting things then you could avoid those things being posted in the first place by asking the general public not to post them.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse I don't need someone to tell me what to do, that's the whole thing, I do what I want to do. But there are rules and boundaries to everything, If I wanted money and there were no law saying that I can't rob a bank, then guess what? I'm gonna rob a bank. If I want to annoy the shit out of some person because it's funny to me, and there's no rule against it then guess what? You see? It's the same.<br>
<br>
The previous poster is right, the RTA boards used to be a lot of fun, and a lot of great arguments and things were settled here, now anyone who doesn't think like a care bear is blocked, banned, locked, and deleted all because some crybaby bitches and their feelings.<br>

Again, if i remember well, that was sugarr that i asked, but i could be wrong on it.<br>

For the malaka part, when i chose this name it was pure random, and it is a coincidence it is an insult in greek. trust me or not, once again for the last time, i dont care.<br>

Actually the only thing i care in your post is... why flaming me? because i did the same thing as you by answering one of your completely useless post &quot;who cares?&quot;? If it is because of that, i should link you the post where you are speaking of &quot;not being able to take a joke&quot;<br>

I have disagreed with lock-ups nycah has done before, but never will I challenge what goes on in the general section. I agree with her 100% that were all sick and tired of your sensless bullshit, and there is no place for it in the general section.<br>
<br>
As for your threat...WTF??? I dont care HOW much support you think you may have from the community, you just said it doesnt matter what any of them (or all of them) think. We elected Nycah as an admin, and we charge her (and others) with the responsibility to mediate this board. She has made it PAINFULLY obvious that flames in the general section will not be tolerated, and WILL be deleted. So just follow the damn standard. If you simply want to challenge any type of authority, then I will fully support your banning...over and over and over again if you choose to make new acounts and new IP's.<br>
<br>
People defend that this used to be a place to speak your mind freely without the threat of censorship, but you arent speaking your mind and you have openly admitted that. You openly take an opposing view of anyone (whether you actually feel that way or not) and berate and belittle them....ALL THE DAMN TIME!!! Its annoying. Find a REASON to speak, then think about what you are saying, and who your audience is. Then think about what medium you use to speak your mind. This is advice for one's whole life, not just here.<br>

Wow, you really are into the whole act like a complete tard when there is no real accountability.<br>
<br>
Why do they have to explicitly post rules saying &quot;be an asshole in flames, and be a considerate human being in general&quot;?<br>
<br>
You can't grasp that concept on your own? Too much freedom?<br>
<br>
Here's a tip, Grul..whatever, just go away.. this wasn't censorship.. it was taking out the trash.. too bad she just stopped at the posts.<br>

Ok now as to Grullin's other posts..I am starting to understand why he is tired of reading about what we have done in game...he doesn't play anymore.<br>
<br>
So if you don't play...and this message board is for teh discussion of The Rathe activities..why are you here Grullin?<br>

Anyway, So some of you don't like me because of some retarded shit on the damn message board. A) You don't matter to me B) It just shows me how Shallow and impressionable you are, because I could create a new user and come here and argue against myself and guess what? You would like me.... C) You are all just Sheep. How does it feel to be a follower?<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy you newer more touchy feely RTA Boards.<br>
<br>
I wonder if I donate a bunch to the Stay Gold fund if I can say whatever I want without being cencored by Osama Bin Nyca?<br>

Your name rhymes with the mouse's name on &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot;.<br>
<br>
Flaming people on their grasp of the written word and their interpretation of the meaning of words in the dictionary is in very poor taste, and you won't even see me doing that. <br>
<br>
It's stupid, just like you.<br>
<br>
DO, that signature is old, I thought it was funny at the time. If I remember correctly so did Nyca.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this is old now too. Gonna start something else. Let's see we've covered Gays, We've covered Power abuse, We've covered annoyance. What will really piss you shit bags off?<br>
<br>
Maybe a thread about the shift in the general &quot;type&quot; of player <br>
since about a year and a half ago. Let me think on it.<br>
