Brief History<br>
<br>
Maut Joined the band well over a year ago just before I joined the guild.<br>
I joined as a level 12 necro back in August 99  who was baren on equip with very little to my name other than I was a fun guy and had a RL friend in the band.<br>
<br>
When I asked in guildchat for a magical weapon so I can beat on willowisps Maut said &quot;I will not give you such a thing but I wiil quest you&quot; &quot;Bring me Shrubbery to the SouthKarana&quot; At this time Maut was still a Shadow knight.<br>
<br>
In early october I made my leave for 6 months because I was in the navy and had a deployment to go to.<br>
Just after I left maut Roleplayed a Great Sacrafice to the gods where he was killed and his soul abolished and restarted as a druid. (BTW if you dont know Maut is a major roleplayer and completely refuses to talk ooc etc... )<br>
<br>
I came back to the new maut in late Feb this level 49 Druid, and so began me leveling for when I left I was a wee 20th level.<br>
<br>
Some more MAUT quests insued over the next few months as I levled to gain equipment that was just beyond my reach at the current level. This also held true to any band member who wanted a quest. Maut was the heart of the guild. Most who knew him Greatly cared for him.<br>
<br>
SO on we went throught the last year Maut became very close to some of us both in Game, and even a few of us he graced with a little RL discussions and ooc talk.<br>
<br>
I grew Veryclose to maut calling him my best friend, Comeing to his aid if he ever needed it, and him me.<br>
<br>
The relationship in game I developed with him I really did care about him, just like someof you have made similar relationships.<br>
<br>
HISTORY OVER<br>
<br>
EVENTS OF LAST NIGHT THURSDAY JAN 4<br>
<br>
Since the advent of SOV Maut has been roleplaying a desire to see POG since the GOD was tunare who supposedly cursed him in his current druid form.<br>
After our famous Fear attempt we began our fate ful journey<br>
We arrived within 100 ft of the POG entrance when he began RP'ing Writheing pain, and dismay and finally nuked himslef to death.<br>
<br>
He was promptly SHOUTED for a res in /groupsay and was resed. He roleplayed destroying the mask of the deciever he used to take on DE form saying the sould of Maut was in it and now all that remained was timdul or whatever he wants to be called now. (at this point we all thinking oh cool so we have to restore mauts soul or whatever) Well he starts berateing people in guild chat useing language and comments never spewed at a fellow guild member I ever seen. Alma and my self roleplaying it out duel him to attempt to destroy the evil(good if your tunare)within him both succesfulky defeating this 59druid. well he then gated to Lava to take on Zanthor our Dark warrior who was defeated as was Salura lvl 30 sk, At wich point things got wierd.<br>
<br>
People started to have thier guild tage removed throughout Norrath (maut was an officer) almost a dozen people sending tells to me WTF why did I get kicked.<br>
Alma being a leader along with Zanthor promptly guild removed him to prevent further incedents .<br>
<br>
At this point we find maut in NRO face to face with a BOTs memeber makeing intentions clear he was through with BOTBH and wanted to join up.<br>
<br>
WE all sent tells to him, getting one answer MAUT IS DEAD I AM TIMBAL.<br>
<br>
EVENT DONE<br>
<br>
BEGIN FLAME<br>
<br>
Maut you fucking coward useing an RP event to not only remove yourself from the guild but Hurting people, Destroying the deep seated trust you harbored with us all.<br>
Betraying your status and privelege of being an officer.<br>
<br>
This is the most Dispicable thin I have EVER SEEN.<br>
<br>
You are truly worst that anything on the Rathe server, Xenth and jamany have better charecteristics then you atleast they SAY WHAT THEY want and how they feel.<br>
<br>
Yoiu fucking coward try to use an RP event to basically go down in the worst way possible.<br>
<br>
You desttoyed alot Maut. Dont ever call on me for anything. you will not recieve it, I would rather give my last piece of food to a rat in FP because it is higher on my scale of life than you are.<br>
<br>
FUCK YOU MAUT!<br>
<br>
END FLAME<br>

Glorious in its honesty.<br>

You set up the history and event for those who were not there, I'll have to agree that it's accurate of what has happened...<br>
<br>
For those that knew Maut, he is no more, EBay would be less of an insult to those who called him friend.<br>

You all Roleplay..right?  Well then he did it the right way.  if he would have said &quot; guys I want to leave the guild&quot;  you would have been shocked.  So do not give me this Bullshit that you hate him cause of the way he left.  You said it yourself.  You though oh cool.  Too bad it just did not turn out the way you thought it was going to!<br>
<br>
Number two = You guys have LEACHED off Maut for the last year and it is time for him to move on.  You guys EXPECTED so much out of him, but he always did what you asked!  God forbid if he was to tell you &quot;no&quot;  you would have flamed him in tells, ect.<br>
<br>
For those of you who know Maut, know he has no intension to harm your game play.  Any notice how he has not relpied back to any of you on your nasty posts?  I think he replied on another bourd, but he was very calm and forgiving of your additude torward him.  He has not &quot;used&quot; anyone in your guild for the last year.  If you say and think that then you have no reason to post ANYTHING about him.  Because if he used you then you pretty much kept him as your guild bitch for the last year and now he have the BALLS to stand up and say &quot; NO MORE&quot;.  But I do not think that is the case.  I think he has helped you all as you all have helped him.  Let him go, for it is time he moves on.  End the anger against him and be proud of his desicion to leave.  a child does not stay with his or her mother for the rest of their life.  No, they move on.  You all should stand up next to him and be proud of him and thank him for all the help he has done for you in the past.  If not then you were never a friend, but merely a LEACH.<br>
<br>
<br>
FYI.... From what I have read here and on other bourds, you are only hurting yourselves and your guild.  You make it sound like if one jions, stay a year with you and gives all that he can possible give, and then decides it is time to move on, he is the worst enemy that there can possible be.  And by posting a flame on someone like Maut.  If just sounds like to me him leaving took the bottle away from you all.<br>
<br>
So your guild has lost a great player!  It happens guys face it and move on! <p>Felenia Soultwister <BR>

<br>
I was closer to maut then most anyone. He called me best friend, I called him the same. But ranting in guild chat calling his ingame wife a whore, and others many other innapropriet words was his first mistake(we dont take that stuff lightly in guildchat) his second and most grave of mistakes was disbanding guildmembers across 3 continents and 7 zones.<br>
<br>
As far as him giveing himself it all to the guild for the last year and several months...He wasnt the only one , I learned my giveingness from him. Because of him and myself we made a semi quasi guild policy where we dont sale things until someone in guild doesnt need it, and we dont sale to guildies under most conditions. WE were the heart and soul of the guild, anyone in the guild looks to maut and then me, now I am left alone, barren of my best friend, my heart being thrown to the ground and smashed as you would smash a ant under your foot.<br>
<br>
And as far as LEACHING Fuck you , no one LEACHED he gave, there is a difference, no one in the guild ever joined thinking oh boy lets go get maut stuff. He chose to issue his quests as I did similar. I was both the beneficiary of his quests and the continuance when he would be on his long trips away from norrath.<br>
The whole leach thing is like me saying<br>
########FICTIONAL STATEMENT#########<br>
 &quot;oh the band was a bunch of leachers they took me for everything I had.&quot;<br>

That is the ONLY reason you started this thred. So why not keep it in your guild bourd and keep it to yourselves rather than let everyone and thier mother know about it?  Less trying to make my sympathise for you and less trying to hurt anothers reputaion, when in fact you, only are showing the people more and more of what an imature brat you truly are!  <br>

Unless you're both trying to imply that this person was removing soluable contents from a substance by the action of  a percolating liquid.<br>

Which is an interesting image, but I kinda doubt it's what either of you intended.<br>

I think this ranks up there amongst 'there/their/they're' and 'effect/affect' on my list of totally petty spelling/usage issues.<br>

It's not so much that people get this stuff wrong, it's that they do it so consistently that I know they think it's right.<br>

 The role playing was a cool way to leave if you're into that, but proceeding to stomp on over a year's worth of friendship and disbanding people within the guild you've spent most of your time in EQ in is simply wrong.<br>
 Stop and place yourself in vince's shoes a minute and think about someone you've known for well over a year that you started EQ with doing that to you. You'd be kinda pissed off and hurt as well.<br>
 Yeah, this shoulda been kept to their own board and not the RTA, but this is kinda what this flame section is for, right or wrong. <p><table width="50%" border="0">

You said:<br>
<br>
&quot;Number one = They way he left your guild was great!&quot;<br>
<br>
You know, Felenia, I don't recall seeing you in either the Awakening Lands or in Lavastorm.  Now, I realize that we can all have alts and there were indeed others in Lavastorm, so I suppose you could have been there as an alt, but (unless you were invis'd in the Awakening Lands) I'm just about positive that you weren't there.  Of course, there's that tricky detail of the entire thing being done in either guild or group chat (I happened to be grouped with Maut, at the time).  Not sure how you could have been a party to that, since you're not (to my knowledge) in the Band of the Black Hand.  I suppose that you could be in as an alt, but I doubt it.  So ... just HTH can you come to the conclusion that the way Maut left the guild was great?<br>
<br>
You also said:<br>
<br>
&quot;Number two = You guys have LEACHED off Maut for the last year and it is time for him to move on&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll take the second part of the statement first.  It might very well have been time to move on.  That's a decision that only the individual concerned can make.  However, to have anyone (either yourself or any of my Brothers and Sisters in the Band) ascribe intent to Maut does a grave disservice to him.<br>
<br>
The first part of your statement chaps my ass.  Who in the HELL are YOU to tell us that we leeched off of Maut???  Were you there?  Were you party to any of the conversations?  Where do you suppose the Mammoth Cloak (poor loot by todays standards but nice when 5K pp meant something) went from my back because he simply said he could use it?  To Maut.  But I guess I was too busy leeching.  Who was the individual who lent a hand to the proof that Maut was indeed a Dark Elf Druid?  I don't recall seeing Felenia Soultwister's name in the screenshots.  I do recall Guard Jacsen kicking my ass, back when XP rezzes weren't quite so easy to come by.  I was happy to do those things without a question asked.  I did it for my son.  Was Maut generous, in return?  I venture to say far more than in equal measure.  But don't you DARE tell me or mine that all we have done is leeched off of Maut.<br>
<br>
If YOU knew Maut, you would understand the pain that we feel.  Have some of my Brothers and Sisters in The Band of the Black Hand overreacted.  In my opinion, yes they have.  Judge their statements, if you will.  But, DON'T YOU PRESUME to judge the depth of our feelings until you've walked in our shoes. <p>Alma Peredo'Animae<BR>

Leeched... (Thanks for correct spelling Bias... their always spelling that wrong =P...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Interesting choice of words.  I will be the first to say that Maut has given hundreds of hours of his gameplay to the assistance of the guild, that he has given thousands of pp, nay, tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of pp worth of equipment to members of the guild.<br>
<br>
So have ALL my members.<br>
<br>
The Band of the Black Hand has always, and will always, be very generous to each other, Many others in the guild have given nearly as much as Maut, while I dont recall anyone ever surpassing that, but then again, Maut was our highest member (Second being myself) and had the ability to farm high level named from Skyfire generating huge quantities of cash/tradefodder.  Did the guild &quot;Expect&quot; gifts of grand scale? Perhaps some did, but most were overjoyed at the opportunity to partake in a &quot;Mautquest&quot; rather than simply be given something.<br>
<br>
We all loved Maut dearly, he was a good friend and a brother in the guild.<br>
<br>
I do not have a problem with him LEAVING the guild.  I have a problem with the removal of others on his way out the door.  I find it unfortunate that it's happened.  In 18 months of leading a guild, over 20 officers have come and gone under my command, one co-leader come and gone as well, NEVER have I seen such a blatant abuse of the trusted power of the /guildremove command.<br>
<br>
Maut simply did not comprehend the trouble it is to travel by foot, without help of teleport spells, to rebuild the guild.<br>
<br>
It took 3 officers 3 hours to do damage control on that.  Including myself who has a casting class bound in the firepots.<br>
