<br>
So therefore, removing hell levels allows those assreaming dickheads who can't spell to continue to level like a monkey to level 60. As a result, you end up with zone chat that looks like &quot;UR A FAGGET BICH AN DIE IRL PLZKTHXLA~&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now, mind you, the 'old guard' level 60's, who hell-levelled their way through 54 and 59, constitue people with a major differance: they know how to spell as they scream at people for training, ksing, and other general kabitzing. <br>

I had to go through lvl 30, 35, 40, 45, 54, 59 hell levels, and all honesty the hardest one's for me was 35 and 45.  54 took me 3 days, 59 took 4 days.<br>
<br>
I think it's great that they removed the hell levels, that way more people might level their characters and we have more people to play with us on the higher level content the game offers. <p>Extrafth Saliva<BR>

<br>
&quot;Kind'a like the way you KS'd my friend after camping 12+ hours for her epic piece&quot;<br>
<br>
I love how these youngsters whinge...  A &quot;long&quot; camp to them is 12+ hours.  Hi... try camping your epic piece for 2 ***MONTHS*** 24/7 (yes, every hour of that 2 months, barring LD of your canary and zone crashes) because the final mob you need spawns only on zone crashes and (seemingly) random times (once every few days at the minimum) and when it does, only stays spawned for 2 hours tops (yup, if it spawned at 4am and no one could respond to it, it was gone at 6am for a few more days - and this happened quite a few times)   The only sure way to 'track' him is to place a level 1 toon in his pathing so you can hear his crunch/death as the signal that the mob is up (and you hope it wakes you up from sleep or that you aren't out buying groceries/working/school).  Don't forget that there are several other canaries out there and it is a race from the start to get to the mob AND you have to travel to the zone on broken boats that would get stuck or just not work, and when your raiding party zoned into the zone all at once, it would disconnect people or crash the zone.  Those who were disconnected hopefully had levitation because they would otherwise have to swim for 20 minutes or gate (if they could) to start the trip over, in order to get there.  When you finally got there (along with potentially a number of other guilds who are also staging) you had to have the guild member who could get there first kite this mob for a while, sometimes 30 minutes, at the same time having people cross kite you to buy time for your guild to get prepared to kill the mob.<br>
<br>
Old school players know what it is like to wait in this game FAR more than the average player coming up through the ranks now.  Newer players are 'spoiled' with all the positive changes that have gone in.  When any old school player sees &quot;I had to wait XX hours (something less than several days) for something&quot; we just shake our heads and move on, laughing at the spoiled child.  YOU guys have it easy.  WE had to suffer through it and PROVE to Verant that there was a problem (a process that sometimes took many months - working as intended... working as intended... working as intended... well, you might be right, we'll change it) before they would change it so that YOU don't have as tough a time going through it as we did.  If you believe there is something wrong, do what we did... if you find a serious issue, collect data as evidence and keep pound away at the walls of Verant until someone listens and don't take 'no' for an answer and stop.<br>
<br>
Things in the game are nerfed on occassion but rarely is it done out-of-hand.  There's a pretty good reason for what they do most of the time.  In the case of the latest changes, they were actually needed to some degree.  Unfortunately, they hurt the smaller/medium guilds more than the higher end guilds.  Guilds who could only do some content *only* because of godrods are hurt somewhat but that is about it.  (In truth, if you use your head, you will realize that you can still maintain healing indefinitely though.) Verant retuned a number of mobs in Luclin to account for the changes and it seems to be OK although many of the fights still seem to be quite long.  Verant was trying to shorten some fights - basically a lot of the high end fights in Luclin were simply tests to see how long you could sustain healing chains and if you could have a mana engine going that could supply infinite mana.  Many of the Luclin raids were simply &quot;can we fight this mob for XX minutes without someone messing up&quot; and that was the entire 'challenge' of the encounter.<br>
<br>
And remember, this game is called EVERQuest... that means it isn't supposed to end until you quit.  It's how these people make money so they do what they can to hook people and keep them hooked.  You can either quit playing or keep playing... it comes down to your choice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udezmuslom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dezmus LoM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/20/02 12:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=785.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ...</span><hr size=1> I was refering to THUNDERKNIFE, since I did quote from his post.<br>

Yea and we had to walk through the snow and ice up hill both ways to Perma...<br>
<br>
I am still amused by the number of people in the game, who do not get the roleplay part of RPG. Since I have never been too concerned about leveling, (seems an inherent part of the quest), how fast it happens or doesn't just isn't a big deal.<br>

<br>
Najena Jboots camp in that homo small room and the stupid list that was like 20 people long <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Evil Eye in Lguk, perma camped while manastone still dropped, the list for that was huge also.<br>
<br>
actually this reminded me of a few old skool things...<br>
<br>
Original Yak graphic owned (Bloodfire anyone?)<br>
<br>
Camping DE mask when it was insta cast inventory usuable, christ knows why they changed it to a long cast time /boggle<br>
<br>
Lists for Priest King and Champ in Sol B<br>
<br>
Lists for FG, Lord, King and SMR in Lguk lol that was funny stuff, waiting at zone in or another grp til you was called up to the camp you put your name down for, people now days just dont realise how much options they have for exp / loot.<br>
<br>
Rubicite camping and Lists, hearing the /shout Grats xxxx on Rubi BP!!!! across the zone and all the applaud for the lucky person<br>
<br>
Mith 2Handers being the own<br>
<br>
Cryosilk Robes being the best looking robe in EQ!! (imo they were anyhow heh)<br>
<br>
Lustrous Russet armor being the bomb!<br>
<br>
Kedge revamp and drooling over Sharkjaw Cutlass and Phinnys Rogue stabber!<br>
<br>
Haxx and Ankh's Mistmoore trains lol.<br>
<br>
I agree with Gromm, alot of the newer players dont realise how much harder things were in the older days of EQ. And im also a firm believer that any moron can make lvl60 in a short period of time now, my personal pet hate has allways been people that have solo'd to high lvls and then claiming they know how to raid, sorry but soloing a character to 60 or whatever doesnt require you to interact with other people that much and learn certain do's and dont's that raid knowledge gives you over time. Cant count the amount of times ive been grpd with druids or necro's on raids who have over aggro'd and died because of it then complained they wasnt healed quick enuff or no one got aggro properly /sigh<br>
<br>
anyhow its been damn fun mostly since release, cant wait to check out PoP, although this new way of getting spells is pretty lame, if verant claim its a *quest* system then they are fucktards, simply looting 1 item and handing it in to 1 NPC for a spell isnt really much of a quest imo, verant cut the middle BS and just either make the spells drop, or atleast some of them buyable /boggle.<br>
<br>
Hopefully the drop rates will get fixed also, hearing reports that 1 spell in 100 kills or so is pretty ghey <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><imgsrc="http://http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/10395.jpg"><br>
