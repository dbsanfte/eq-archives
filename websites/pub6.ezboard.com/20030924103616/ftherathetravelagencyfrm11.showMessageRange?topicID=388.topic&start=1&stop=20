Here's my feedback on the Plane of Hate discussion taking place there.<br>
<br>
We took our turn at bat tonight, Maestro knocked us into the dug out.  Fun fight, we'll be back at him soon -- a little wiser.<br>
<br>
Definately agree that while the zone should be kept on rotation for a short while longer, it really doesn't deserve to be there long term.  Hate is a much larger zone now.  When you kill the Mini-bosses's they're not down for a full day -- instead, mini's have placeholders on a 20-minute spawn, making this a zone that several guilds (or even strong groups) can camp -- all at the same time -- without futzing each other up.  Goofy old planes aggro is gone now, it's more like an indoor PoP zone now.<br>
<br>
I think SoE just turned this into another alternative for high-level XP groups.  Recommend that after the &quot;Gotta See the New Hate&quot; fervor dies down, Maestro and Inny go on rotation (perhaps), but the zone becomes open. <p><BR><img src=http://avengersinfaith.lfchosting.com/images/signatures/ShantarSig1.jpg height=189 width=408></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nyca>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Singing Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 1698<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/7/03 10:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=388.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/slllyonec/EZemo/LeahHarp2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Posting privs on Guild Rep forum, and PoH feedback.</span><hr size=1> Done.<br>

<br>
The Plane of Hate is not on rotation.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Plane of Hate is a reservation zone. <br>
Which is why you need 40 planables to post. <br>
<br>
I think the point is that the Plane of Hate is a pretty good exp zone for a group now.<br>
<br>
And refresh my memory but didn't everyone agree, that we probably should just leave it as is for the boss mobs.<br>
<br>
If you want to run an exp group, there are plenty of FFA days. We spent most of the weekend in Hate in an exp group working on an enchanter epic drop....we had company.<br>
<br>
However, if more than 3 separate exp groups come in it would not be worth it to be there for just exp. You would quickly be running over one another and mages and chanters and clerics would be cussing.<br>
<br>
So I think it should remain a reserve zone. So if your guild needs to go in and take out the boss or miniboss, they can do so without competeing with exp groups.<br>

The problem is that this was back when 40 was a number used to determine ability to succeed in a plane that could eat your corpse should you fail. <br>
<br>
The next statement you make...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
...proves that the situation has indeed changed quite a bit. I have been killing for epic drops in hate for a fair amount of time (not nearly as much as the enchanter I'm going up for) and the zone supports at least 2 fast pulling groups, and will likely, including the hard(er) mobs in the zone, support 3 to 5. That's a lot like the Guard/Crypt/Disco/Zoneout/Chef camp arrangement in Seb, and the mobs/xp/levelrange are nearly comparable, by and large. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'd have to disagree. There are no ring events, no script style kills (minus some funky things during the maestro fight, but that's restricted to the fight itself) so that reserving the plane to allow a guild to attempt a kill, is a herculean effort to ensure privacy... it would be similar, now, to asking people to leave seb while they kill trakanon. The xp areas, with perhaps the exception, maybe, of the maestro's stairs area, would not interfere in any way with raids. I would suggest that FCFS maestro/inny would be fine, until/unless someone asked for a rotational move. (Keep in mind that i'm not intersted in maestro at this time). <br>

The enchanter drop, or any drop for that matter, is not impeded by having others in the zone. The only drawback to having another group in the area, is that *all* the spawns are not yours. Certainly, that is a drawback but not an unfair one, since the same thing occurs in every other zone in which items drop. <br>
<br>

<br>
I disagree. If the groups were all sticking to only the 'easy' area then yes, it would be overcrowded, but in the same way that 2 groups can't (shouldn't) camp guard. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
The mini bosses are on a random spawn with PH's, and the respawn is certainly less than half an hour. In 20 hours, I've seen perhaps 10 mini bosses in hate, not included in that number are the ones killed by other groups. If that is typical, it is a higher rate than named at the guard camp in seb. Killing mini's can be done with one group, not even a strong group. I personally kill with 3 other characters when I am in hate. <br>
<br>
Killing Maestro and Inny are raid forces, and if you take a raid force to kill Mini's in hate, well, you are probably too low to do the epic quests you are getting parts for. <br>
<br>
It will be, if an unreserved plane, a situation where groups compete with groups, as is the standard for the entire server, and raids FCFS on the maestro or inny or both, until/unless they decide to rotate them. It will not be a situation in which a single group blocks an entire raid from killing mobs. <br>
<br>
I would support removing hate from a 'reserved zone' and instead open it up to the use that it now is best suited for, after the initial time that we've waited to see if the zone is a raid, group, or mixed zone. I would offer that it is indeed a mixed zone, in a way very much analogous with Sebilis, by virtue of the 'boss' mobs and zone mobs being of quite a differant nature with regards to respawn, difficulty, and drop rates. <br>

It is not a typical experience zone though it can support more than one group it certainly doesn't support several disjointed groups or raids.<br>
<br>
Also, the content, even revised, is still geared for guilds/people in the same stage as it always was even though there is some more advanced mobs and loot available.  If DHG were just coming into the stage of doing old world planes I would like to have the same advantage all those who went before had in being able to actually schedule a raid for those epic pieces and gear and know that you will be able to do your raid.  Otherwise you struggle to get the numbers together to actually succeed then find that there are 2 groups there already and you now have your best raid force assembled and nothing to do.  There's not a lot of comparable raid zones not calendared.  I just remember when DHG was just getting to the old world planes and how much the calendar helped us because at the time it took all we had to do it.<br>
<br>
As it is on calendar there are a LOT of free days available.  We have, and I'm sure others have as well, shared the zone when it was &quot;ours&quot;.   However sharing with another group/guild is different than sharing with whoever might happen to be there which might be 2-3 groups.  <br>
<br>
As it is, no one is denied the ability to use the zone.  In fact the revamp has made it more accessible to shorter farming missions.  I've never heard someone say &quot;let's go to hate and get some exp&quot;.  We have discussed making single groups to farm so we can get better exp while doing it but not the same.  Having it on calendar does make it more accessible to guilds that are at the point of NEEDING that content as they can schedule the plane and since they might need a majority of their members to be successful can plan on it.  <br>
<br>
That's from my viewpoint anyway.  Maybe guilds that progressed like DHG don't really exist anymore /shrug  We did grow up much like the older guilds without benefit of recruiting already high level players with experience at these zones.  I was under the impression that many guilds/alliances grow up this way still in today's game.  Don't misunderstand me in that I acknowledge we had gear and knowledge that the earlier guilds didn't have on their first attempts.  I'm only pointing out that I believe there are guilds that still need that content for whom it is indeed a challenge for a raid.  And there maybe more guilds coming up in that fashion.<br>
<br>
I can see some room for argument on the &quot;qualifications for reservation&quot; though.  I'm not prepared to make that argument as I have no alternative solution in mind but it might make sense to relax the reservation qualifications some.   When we (as the GotR alliance at the time) first got our 40 planables for reservation we struggled hard with that place and it wasn't really fun at first.  So maybe it isn't an unreasonable number.<br>
<br>
DHG votes for leaving on reservation and seperate rotations for Inny and Maestro if guilds killing them feel the need for rotation.  Seems like same caveat with Fear and CT would be appropriate in that it be done in coordination with the reserving guild if it's reserved that day.  I could also see fit for a modification the guidelines for that plane.  Waiting until a reserving guild has left is really not needed due to respawn rate.  It would seem more appropriate that when the reserving guild arrive any existing people should be prepared to leave if an arrangement for coexistance can't be made.   Attempting to make arrangements with the reserving guild in advance would seem preferable but there is really nothing lost to the reserving guild by someone being in plane ahead of them.<br>
<br>
And to add on last minute thought... the calendar actually facilitates everyone in use of the zone.  Not only do reserving guilds know they have a place to go, those planning to go know when is not a good time to plan and/or who to talk to if they want to arrange a share.  Last two times we've been up there we shared with others.  Indeed one time we went on a FCFS day and the 3 box that was there allowed us to have a piece for ours.  It seemed a much more amiable situation for all parties.  Not once did someone have to say &quot;you took one of our mobs&quot;.  Never did a tracker show up and grab the mini-boss that finally spawned after we killed it's ph 17 times.  <br>

<br>
When it was in it's original form, mini's spawned on a much longer span than they do now. Hate had a long, long repop and once mobs were down, with the exception of the wandering patrols, that was that. <br>
<br>
Now, the repop is quick, and the mini's much more frequent. <br>
<br>
Additionally, any guild that struggles to put together a mini's raid in hate, hasn't looked at the actual statistics of the mobs themselves. Top hit of 500, minor casting, and well under 15k hp, probably closer to 10, make for a mob that is the wimpy little brother of some mobs in the king camp in sebilis. The pulls are single, not the mass trains of the old days. <br>
<br>
I really don't mind if a guild wants to reserve a day, or what not. The problem comes when the guild that reserves a day pops up and finds someone else there. <br>
<br>
See, the reason for the reservation in the past is that it was a long spawn, that was difficult to coordinate around and dangerous in most respects due to the type of zone in area (IE: aggro immediately from several mobs, some very hard to mez).<br>
<br>
Now, I could zone a naked level 46 bard into hate, and tell jokes at the nearest mobs if I was inclined. The repops are as close to instant as they could be when you're dealing with epic drops and the like. <br>
<br>
The point is, that I'm driving at, that since there is no consequence for a group being there, and having killed mobs that will repop in 20 minutes, and have many, many other mobs up and about, there should not be a punishment for being there, as there would be if a guild dropped in and found 3 groups already clearing fear and taking the drops there. <br>
<br>
The nature of the new hate is such that attempting to reserve the entire zone is at the same time, both unnecessary and greedy. The same types and kinds of mobs will pop, just as fast as you can kill them, if not nearly as fast as you can kill them, and if you are able to bring 4 groups up, and the area would support 5, is it really justifiable to punish the 1st group already there, for being in a zone that is basically now the same as any other xp zone?<br>
<br>
Those people that do not go to hate for xp are missing what would likely be a good challenge and good xp for the 51-59 range, and there are areas that provide passable AA xp at levels 61 and up, though the xp drops off sharply. <br>
<br>
From the normal, average zone mobs, there is really no loot that would be worth the time of any group in the zone. The old hate armor drops are substandard to many, if not all, kunark armor items for the same class, and drop with an almost equal frequency. <br>
<br>
The mobs that would be desireable for loot, are of a completely differant nature. Any guild that has *any* trouble fielding any 3 people who couldn't together kill a hate mini boss, will likely fail horribly against the maestro. Yes, I would say that even 3 warriors with proper aggro management from a guild that could kill maestro would own the hate mini's into the ground. <br>
<br>
The issue of reserving the zone is, now, to me, a moot one, since any and all mobs that are in the zone will replace within 30 minutes; if I am there and you have reserved the plane, than I would certainly leave if asked. However, I think that due to the nature of the mobs and the length of their repop, that only the most arrogant and hostile human beings would seek retribution for that 'transgression'. <br>
<br>
It would be similar to guard getting mad at the crypt group that moved in half an hour ago because they killed the mobs on the way down. The mobs are already replaced by repop at that time, and I seriously doubt if the intentions of the calendar resevations of hate were to allow a zone full of fast repopping mobs to be reserved on the peril of being somehow punished by the conventions of the RTA.<br>

<br>
It was empty. I have done this several time lately on nights that were FFA...I have seen various numbers from groups with 3 to about a dozen people in the zone.<br>
<br>
But more often than not..the zone is empty.<br>
<br>
Now if the zone was actually becomin as popular as SEB...I would agree that perhaps it should not be on the calendar.<br>
<br>
But I fail to see that having a day reserved for guilds to farm what they need or take down the boss mobs without interuption is currently causing anyone a &quot;real&quot; problem.<br>
<br>
If you are posting in here...then your guild &quot;can&quot; reserve a day. <br>
<br>
If you want to exp grind there..and I have lately..go for it...it is not hard to check the calendar.<br>
<br>
I have a counter proposal.<br>
<br>
Why don't we continue to have the reservation, but allow more than 6 visitors on a raid in Hate.<br>
<br>
That way if a group wants to go, they can join a raid guild, without fear of reprisal. The reserving guild is still responsible for their raid and loot dispersal, but epic hunting chanters can continue their farming without interuption. <p>Shariona Seerkin Circle of Virtue<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I could also see fit for a modification the guidelines for that plane. Waiting until a reserving guild has left is really not needed due to respawn rate.

I think it is highly likely I would also support the removal of guest limit proposed by Shariona as well though would have to put a little more thought into that.

<br>
However, why would we force a plane to remain empty on a day that is reserved, when the repops replace so quickly?<br>
<br>
Example: Friday, when someone has Hate booked. If they enter the zone and find 6 people trying for their epic piece, are we going to remove the guild in question from posting rights? Or from rotation rights?<br>
<br>
 If they leave when asked, the mobs they killed will be back up within 20ish minutes, and the guild going up there, is going for those mobs... there is, at most, a 20 minute loss in time, and that's if the group there completely cleared the entire zone. <br>
<br>
Unless a raiding guild is going to use the plane for the entire 24 hours they have booked off, why should we punish, or have a punishment for, people who use it when the reserving guild is not there?<br>
<br>
In the old days of an 8 hour repop, it was because you could screw someone's entire raid. Now, when it is less than half an hour at least, probably closer to 20 minutes, where is the justification for punishment? The mobs that someone 'might have been able to kill'?<br>
<br>
Certainly, if people *have* to book a plane, desipite my skepticism that any group of 6 planable characters would not be able to single pull, and kill most of the mobs in hate, then by all means, book it, and ask anyone who is there when they arrive, to leave. <br>
<br>
The punishment aspect was originally there, I would estimate, to prevent people from taking mobs that would be denied to the group reserving the plane. <br>
<br>
Now that removing those mobs is a distinct impossibility for any length of time, why is there a moratorium on entering the zone when the reserving guild is not yet raiding? <br>
<br>
If the guild is going to raid for a full four or 10 hours, sure, but for the time they are not there, why prohibit people from using the zone? <br>
<br>
Why does the reservation for the 4/8/12 hour raid make the rest of the time a 'no fly' area, when there is no longer any harm caused by killing the mobs in hate? There is no denial of content to a guild raiding hate, if there is a group in for the 12 hours before their raid: their mobs are up and ready to go, with as much chance for drops as ever. <br>
<br>
It is akin to sebilis for respawn, difficulty, and number of groups able to function in an area. Sebilis does, in fact, have an epic encounter with in it as well, though not alagorical to this zone, admittedly. <br>
<br>
If it is, though, only epic drops that people are interested in, and that is the sole and only reason to be on a reserved calandar system despite a fast repop, might I inquire as to why Lord Begurgle, and moreover, Lake Rathe, not on a calandar'd reservations system? Lord Begurgle is much more uncommon than the minibosses in hate, even. The mobs in Permafrost drop loot as well as items for an epic quest, why is permafrost not on a calandar reservation system? <br>
<br>
I am not trying to be dismissive, or even antagonistic. I am not, at all, opposed to people reserving the zone, and if I was xp grinding and/or epic farming and a guild with a reservation said &quot;excuse me, we have a reservation...&quot; I wouldn't be upset or anything but polite. <br>
<br>
However, I do think that reserving the entire plane, for the entire 24 hours, (unless your raid is going to last for the entire 24 hours) is now too drastic a situation for the zone's mechanics. <br>
<br>
If the even minority wish is to keep hate on a reserved calandar, by all means, keep it there. <br>
<br>
However, realize that with the changes to the zone, comes the situational change that makes punishing people for 'intruding' on the 24 hour period an obsolete measure. <br>
<br>
Not leaving when asked by a reserving guild, certainly would be against the rules, and I'd support a shift in that direction gladly. But to make the entire zone inaccessable for likely 3 times as long as your raid itself will last, (6 hour raid, 18 hours inaccessable) is not exactly the intention of the caladar system. <br>
<br>
If the system is built to allow access to the most players, in a fair way, by all means, and with no hesitation from me, make it that way to the utmost:<br>
<br>
When a reserving guild enters the zone, all members they don't want in the zone are required to leave. However, until they begin their raid, allow people to group in the zone. It causes them no distress, as the mobs that they want to kill are back up, likely before they are finished pulling the zone in area. <br>
<br>
My point is that this zone is now able to be greatly shared and with no harm to those who would reserve the zone. <br>
<br>
Why not adapt the rules to cover this new situation, rather than keeping a model that, working well for the old hate, would be easily retuned for the new hate?<br>
<br>
If nothing else, sticking to rules  that were made before the revamp ignores the very basic fact that the revamp occured. The zone is very differant now, and while it may be that some guilds, on the server, need to reserve the plane to get any sort of results from going, they don't need to reserve the plane for the entire day, anymore. <br>
<br>
It does not protect the reserving guild in any way, to have mobs up for 4,6,10 hours that would respawn in 20 minutes if they were killed in that time. <br>
<br>
I would suggest the middle ground of retaining reservations but allowing people to be there before the reserving guild as long as they leave when the reserving guild enters the zone, would be a change that suits the new nature of the zone while still respecting the unique elements of the zone. <br>

<br>
But I also disagree.<br>
<br>
There are exactly 7 days reserved by Guilds for the month of August.  There are 24 other days when muliple groups of people can go up and camp to their hearts content.  Why would/does anyone want to/have to go on a day that's reserved?<br>
<br>
IF 31 out of 31 days were reserved, and guilds only went up there for 2 to 3 hours out of those days, I'd say you were entirely right. <br>
<br>
However, except for 3 of the &quot;larger&quot; guilds reserving a day, the other days are reserved by Guilds/Alliances that, sure as shooting, they'll be up there for as many hours as they can be.<br>
<br>
Now, why would you want those other 4 guilds/entities to have to argue with a few/many groups to get what they thought they were going to get?<br>
<br>
And suppose they are going up their for Maestro?  Or for the Hand (if it still spawns)?  Allowing a group(s) to go up there before them, could lose them the very mob for which they reserved the Plane.  Picking a day always means the chance that your mob may not be up, that's the chance you take.  But to have someone go up, on your day, and gank your mob, well, that would be stinky.<br>
<br>
If guilds are still reserving the Plane, they should get their day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roggulbuk>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><marquee>Newbie Admin!</marquee> <BR>

I don't want them to have to argue. Zoning in and seeing a group or two there and saying &quot;hey guys, our booking day&quot; isn't arguing. If the groups don't leave, there is as much (or little) that can be done about it now, as could be done about it a year ago. <br>
<br>
I'm not asking for free reign to kill the maestro, or whatever else. I'm suggesting that it is unreasonable to deny access to an entire zone for 24 hours, for the sake of one group's 4 hour raid. I mean, there is a hugely, hugely strong case to take it completely off the calandar, (easy zone, fast repops, mobs that drop epic parts are easy to get, loot mobs are rotation style in-zone, etc, and the argument that epic drops are protected by the calandar day is defeated by the fact that we don't reserve 24 hour periods in the City of Mist, yet it has epic drops for ranger, mage, shadowknight and shaman, at least). If the worry about booking a day to safely AE it all is valid, than we should be reserving CoM as well, for whatever reason. I'm not suggesting it's removed from the rotation. I just think that we should allow groups to go up, and take the regular zone mobs when they are otherwise not being contested in any way. We're not talking about ganking the only mob they wanted to kill, we're talking about not removing the reservation rights from an entity who kills 30 minute repop mobs before the guild that has reserved the plane is starting their raid. <br>
<br>
The zone itself is not unlike any other unprotected-by-calandar zone that has epic drops off fast respawning mobs, and I'm just wondering why, really, the reasoning seems to be &quot;It doesn't happen a lot that people want to go on a day that is booked&quot; and &quot;Some people need large groups to kill there&quot;. There's no, seemingly, argument that having groups in there killing zone trash would be a problem, minor or major, for the reserving guild's persuit of epic drops, provided the non-reserving group leaves when asked. <br>
<br>
I mean, if we reserve a day and go up for 5 minutes for our &quot;raid&quot;, does that mean people have to stay out for the 24 hours that we have it reserved for? If we are raiding at 11pm PST, why would people have to wait all day and most of the EST night and not be able to go in for the mobs that respawn quickly?<br>
<br>
I just really can't see a 'harm' and as such, in the 'no harm, no foul' way of life that we have around here, it doesn't gel. <br>
<br>
Like, Hate is booked tonight, right now. At 11pm EST, if I see that hate is empty, I have no way to know if the zone has not yet been used, or has already been used by whatever guild has it booked. After the reserving guild leaves, it's FFA, obviously. If I go up and kill stuff before the start of the PST Guild's raid start, but the dead mobs refresh in 20 minutes, is that really worth being against the rules?<br>
<br>
I'm big on following written rules. I don't intend to willingly or knowingly be in hate before a raiding guild has used it for the day. But it's very, very, very silly to treat hate like it is some vaunted and magical place that requires a full day to ensure repops and preparation time. Believe me, I've not at all forgotten the preparation for the old hate my guild used to do. Even the last time we went up, long after ToV HoT armor and gear, we went in hard and took nothing for granted in that zone. <br>
<br>
The new hate, is a playground. Not because of my gear or level, but because of the layout, frequency of mobs, their proximity to other mobs, and their capacity for chain aggro being greatly reduced. Their social aggro ranges are very small as well. <br>
<br>
All I'm suggesting, is that if there is no harm, there should be no foul. If I kill mobs in hate that will repop in 20 minutes, and a guild asks me to leave, and I leave without issue on their reserved day, I want it recognized and understood that it is a 'no harm' situation, because that is in fact what it is. I'm not suggesting I'm going to kill maestro and hand and inny, and deny their raid content. I'm not keeping them from getting anything, and I'm not disrupting their raid for longer than it takes to say /ooc we're here now, we've got the plane booked, we'd appreciate the plane to ourselves. The only delay I would ever give to that ooc, would be &quot;Right away, have one mob up and then we're gone, good luck&quot;.<br>
<br>
I don't think that anyone, considering the facts of the new zone, the types of mobs in it, or any of the situational issues that may arise, would find that a 'harmful' situation. <br>
<br>
My bottom line, really, is that it doesn't make sense to not allow yard trash to be killed in hate, for the reason that it is the way we've always done it. The zone is not the same, the rules should reflect that. Respect dictates, and rightly, that if the zone reservation system is wanted by even a minority, that we keep it, and respect dictates that if someone who has reserved the plane wants it, they get it when they arrive, no problem. But respect doesn't, in my view, go so far as to leave the entire zone empty for even half the day, when it is litterally zero harm to the guild going up, if you kill the mobs that will have respawned by the time they get there, or will respawn at the absolute longest. It is beyond the scope of the original rules, it is beyond the scope of guilds asking for respect. <br>
<br>
Believe me, I respect other people's raids, groups, camps, loot, effort, toons, and game enjoyment. I won't engage in behavior that makes the game 'worse' for someone else. This behavior doesn't make the game worse for anyone, in any factual or logical way. <br>
<br>
Anyway, that's me, if it is still so obviously a horrible idea, I'll let it rest, but I just don't see the reason for the opposition to it; the drop frequency won't change, the available mobs won't change, the possibility for a hampered raid is virtually non existant, the zone is no longer unique in that it has long, long repops on basic zone mobs, it's no differant than many other unreserved zones, the only direction I can see the opposition coming from is the 'it's the way it is' and I don't agree with or understand the reluctance. <br>

<br>
I'm not suggesting that people &quot;have&quot; to go on any day in particular. When they do go up on reserved days, because they're not harming anything, why would they be punished? Or rather, why would it be against 'the rules'?<br>
<br>
Why do people want to/have to log in? The measure of if someone wants to go, is just that: if they want to go. They don't *have* to do it, any more than a guild *has* to book a day, really. They could also just use one of those FFA days if they wanted to. The point isn't that a person wanting to go to hate wants to go on a reserved day, or that they have to go on a reserved day. The point is that going on any day, reserved or not, and killing mobs that respawn in 30 minutes, isn't doing a single drop of harm to anyone. As long as people are not impeding someone's raid, harming their group, or any other use on a reserved or unreserved day, I can't see the justification for it being against the rules. <br>
<br>
We have rules to protect people, and groups. That's what they do. They protect them from having a raid ruined by not having mobs. They protect them from having the chance at an item lost, because of the mobs having been killed already.<br>
<br>
What protection is granted in this case? No one would be worried about their mob being up in hate, since all but Inny, Maestro and (maybe) hand are on 30 minute respawns. If people are after those specific mobs, and desire them, the rotation system is much more suited to protecting them. Even with that said, the desire to be able to kill zone mobs does not equate to someone losing their chance at Inny or Maestro or A hand of the Maestro by a rogue guild on a reserved day. I am fully in favor of whatever consequences are deemed appropriate for anyone killing a mob that does not respawn in under an hour in a reserved zone. That would significantly hamper a raid there, especially if that mob was their only target (if you will allow me the logical conclusion, that any guild going to attempt maestro or Innoruk right now, likely won't want any of the loot that drops off the regular zone mobs, and any guild that wants the loot drops off the regular zone mobs and has to raid to get them, won't be killing maestro or inny any time soon...) And to that end, while I think it is unlikely that the 'stolen' raid mobs would occur on the reservation day itself, I am willing to cede the possibility that it could happen, and any persons in hate, in my mind, who are on someone else's reserve day, are very wrong to take any mob that will not be back in 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
Look, maybe if I approach the situation this way...<br>
<br>
If I, and 5 members of my guild, are killing zone mobs and a guild comes in and says &quot;Guys, we reserved the plane for today&quot; and we say &quot;Right you are, we're on our way out, have a good hunt&quot; and leave, what are the consequences, and do you think those consequences as prescribed by the RTA now, are fair, and fit the transgression as we see it?<br>
<br>
The conditions of the zone when my group leaves, is that there are no mobs dead that will not repop within 30 minutes, and that no raid mobs have been killed, at all. <br>

I agree that any group of CB could go in and probably take down Maestro and Inny and waltz through Hate with no problem.<br>
<br>
Can you agree, that just as it was in the begginning there are guilds and alliances as posting entities....who do not have the capability to do that?<br>
<br>
Hang around the entrance...yes...but waltz through...no<br>
<br>
How about Sky....which is still on Calendar?<br>
<br>
It is not death on entrance to go there...why not take it off Calendar?<br>
<br>
Fear is not an easy break in...but I have seen groups enter and kill near the entrance with no problem. So why not open Fear so those over 65 with great gear can go farm Fear? <p>Shariona Seerkin Circle of Virtue<br>

I will give you a few good reasons.<br>
<br>
1. The majority of the server has been indoctrinated to not go to fear or hate because of reservations, fear of interefering or incureing the disdain from thier fellow Rathe members.<br>
2. Some have not viewed, looked at or concerned themselves with keeping themselves up to date with current RTA issues.<br>
3.Why bother going up to a zone where you first have th check a calendar make sure no one is up there and then possibly port up and find a guild mass pulling what is currently considered by the vast majority of people as raid content? Can you ask them to share or because its on calendar they get it under the FCFS rule?<br>
<br>
In addition to all the reasons above phsycologicaly people are prone to do what thier used to, they are used to not going to hate because of almost 4 years of rules regarding it.<br>
<br>
I know personaly if I didnt have a calendar to worry about I would be 2boxing twinks up thier for XP for me and gear for them =) but thats just me.<br>
<br>
As far as the COV statement that maybe CB can waltz through but lower guilds cant.<br>
<br>
I would have to greatly disagree with you. Hate is no harder then your basic GUK/Seb style mobs, albeit some deeper areas have larger hp/melee mobs but its organized just like an xp zone. You can single pull most of it very easily with a monk, necro or sk puller, possibly with pacification line and enc or cleric , possibly a bard could do just as well.The mobs on avg hit for mid level seb, but overally ALOT LESS then your POP zone XP mobs wich I see the &quot;small poor defenseless&quot; guilds handle very well. Includeing groups of COV members.<br>

<br>
Sure we are getting further in...but that is a small percentage of the guild, that have the advantage of having friends who have helped them with gear.<br>
<br>
We have a larger percentage who have the level but not the gear.<br>
<br>
And if this is difficult for us, I imagine it is even harder for some guilds that are newly comin up who are on the verge of acheiving posting status.<br>
<br>
My point was CB waltzing throguh with one group is hardly comparable to COV exping near the entrance and Mirth groups hardly get to Maestro's stairs before we encounter possible wipes. <br>
<br>
Same as SEB...I think that is still a matter of perspective. <p>Shariona Seerkin Circle of Virtue<br>
