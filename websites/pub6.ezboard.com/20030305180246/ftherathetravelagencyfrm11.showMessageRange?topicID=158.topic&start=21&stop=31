He took the time off to camp it , and i'd assume he did it knowing now he didnt have to wait forever and perhaps even longer due to his personal life schedule to get the rage part done.&quot;<br>

Alistriwen stated it very well.  <br>
<br>
We, as a community, can and have declared &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;conventions&quot;.  If we, as a community, declared that a Cleric must be ready for RF before camping it, it would happen.  <br>
<br>
How much shorter would the line for RF be if only the Clerics *ready* for him, as the last step like it used to be, were camping him?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukenaukamikaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kenau Kamikaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visionaries of Fire</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/22/02 6:23:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=158.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ragefire Agreement question</span><hr size=1> Currently we have 4 clerics with a note and without epic.

Most people have just one account, so if their cleric is logged in at the campspot in Skyfire they can not do ANYTHING else for at least 4 weeks.<br>
I would lose my fun in EQ really fast if I could do not nothing but sit behind my keyboard watching my monitor endless hours. Not to mention that I do not (and not only I) have a 24/7 connection. I  have a dial up connection and I have to PAY to the telephonecompany for EVERY MINUTE that I am online. And Daytime is 4 times the rate tarif of nighttime, and eveningtime is 1.5 times the rate tarif of nighttime. If I would be online a full day, 24 hours, that would cost me: about 50$<br>
Thanks, but no thanks. And believe me, there are others like me out there. It would not only cost trmendous amounts of time, but also tremendous amounts of money.<br>

<br>
After the Incident, it was learned that Trompen wasn't completely ready for Ragefire, as he would have been in his Original Form. ie: Trompen didn't have the King's Note, nor the Pearl from Sol B. <br>
<br>
I know that out-of-sequence camping is doable with the New Ragefire, but I thought that the &quot;Gentlemen's Agreement&quot; had taken this into consideration, and the Honor System was in place?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So my question is....are we trying to asses / have we assesed that this is indeed in the agreement or no?<br>
<br>
As it stands...I'm not here to defend what happened as I have stated previously that I was unawares as to his status in the quest at that point. The most I knew is that he was focused on camping it over an extreme amount of time, so naturally I assumed he as on his last step.<br>
<br>
Now I ask this...<br>
<br>
From the way this reads...the gentleman's agreement was in place at that time. If this is the case...not to bring up issues, but we'd have to then verify that everyone is in the final phase...be it a main or an alt. I will be sure to let my clerics know that this will be the last camp they do from here on knowing what I know now... <p>Karas LightStrider

<br>
If the Rathe agrees that RF be the last step a Cleric needs, it's very simple:  After RF is killed, the Cleric will either run right to TD or not.  Since we've seen how much pressure can be brought to bear by the Rathe as a whole, it would be very simple to censure the Cleric and his Guild (if he is guilded). <br>
<br>
And I'm sure that a Guild is aware at which step their clerics are.<br>

<br>
is directed at Trompen since he's been the focus of this entire conversation. While I agree that a cleric should be on his / her last step, it still doesnt excuse the actions that took place that day.....which is what it feels like....like you are looking for some justification still. <br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm way off base...but there's been no other mention of other clerics...is it because you &quot;learned&quot; that tromp was only at a certain point?<br>
<br>
If I *am* off base...then I apologize. <p>Karas LightStrider

The posts are not directed at trompen or his guild at all. Especially since this amendment was NOT in place when he camped Ragefire.<br>
It was his full right to do so. And as it turned out, when he finally got RF he already got note, because we helped him get it a week or so before he actually got RF. <p>DON'T attack that mezzed m.....

That is a question. That's NOT Judging Trompen or anyone else. We did NOT have this amendment to the RF camp before, and still don't. That is why we are discussing it.<br>

<br>
1. There are more clerics who *could* camp ragefire than there are clerics who have every other part of their epic done- therefore, it would create the shortest possible waiting period, while still having a line up and not a horribly bad list type system. <br>
<br>
2. The current level and placement of Ragefire allows a guild who could not obtain the king note the ability to get a ragefire heart and then do *nothing* with it. (This is generally recognized as a *bad* deal<br>
<br>
(Contest this idea? How about *this* bit of logic: We've already established that, in this community, engaging the ragefire mob ahead of another group, while a legitimate engagement per verants rules, is *not* legitimate per the rules of The Rathe. So when ragefire pops, clerics and guilds there do not have any negative consequences involved with asking larger entities for help in killing ragefire. What does that mean? It means that a lone cleric could camp ragefire and then send a tell out to BotS, NB, SoT, Tindi, etc, and any group or groups that were so inclined would show up, kill the 'wimpy' level 60 dragon and *blammo*: heart rotting in bank. <br>
<br>
3. This puts more epics onto the server faster: Sure, this runs in direct opposition to what Verant wants out of this camp, but quite frankly, f'uck them, they don't have to sit in skyfire for 5 weeks for their epics. Neither do I, but clerics due, and they shouldn't have to, from a game mechanics point of view. <br>
<br>
Why is more cleric epics on the server good for *everyone* and not just the one cleric and their guild? Because, the more click sticks, the bigger chance that you're going to be dead somewhere, and a cleric is going to be able to rez you at the drop of a hat. If every cleric had an epic, it would *almost* remove the experiance penelty associated with dying, and thus, the time sink as well.<br>
<br>
So yeah, it would be *better* if people just didn't camp it until it was the last part they needed. But I don't think we can police it, the way we would a planes date or something like that. <br>
<br>
First person to suggest a list again, or a rotation, here are your instructions for the day:<br>
<br>
1. Pull bottom lip over top of head<br>
2. Swallow.<br>
