<br>
*EDIT* here is the recap - rather post it here than below lol.<br>
<br>
Alrighty, W00T! grats to you all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Lets start at the beginning and work from there. When time came to take attendance we had about 24 people in the zone there for the raid. It wasn't very promising and after waiting till the end of attendance time it was exceedingly obvious that we didn't have enough. At that point the call went out to get people there. It's my understanding that AoVB Alliance had some that came down and that alot more that had backed out had come back cause it started late enough. Thank you to the extra people that came.<br>
<br>
Once I had an accurate list of whowas there or close, Flarren and I made up the groups and got things going. Some left due to impatience and for those that did, &quot;Patience is a Virtue Posessed by some and Used by Less&quot; but anyway. so we started off an hour behind. We had 2 groups head in ahead and clear the way to kings room, from there we got everyone spread and headed in to kings room as well.<br>
<br>
Once there Talovar commenced to pull the IG's for us. After having to repeat ourselves numerous times to move back I got tired of it and told everyone to get back or be removed from the raid. I said it and I meant it. Luckily I didn't have to do exactly that since most people at that point did move back. IG's went smoothly and we moved up into the next chamber.<br>
<br>
In the grate chamber everything went decently smoothly as soon as everyone figured out that the high elf in the red robe was standing on the wall you weren't supposed to be al lol. Thank you to our pullers for bringing the IG's out of Vox's chamber. I understand it went very smoothly and was run by Kommisar (our battle commander) and Talovar (our main puller). As soon as it was clear it was time for buff line.<br>
<br>
Over the past week we have been very busy and in my haste and excitement to finally win I forgot to get the buff line ready with what buffs were needed. Many many thanks to my guild leader Talovar for taking over at that moment and handling it for us. We didn't have the normal 15 buffs for most of us but we all got the ones we truly needed which is what counts even more. Buff line went very smoothly from what I saw and it was completed fairly quickly. At this point Valoran arrived to help Kelemevor and Cottone (sp?) with controlling back spawn and to fill in a couple needed buffs here and there. Once everyone was camped we went to strategy in the chat room.<br>
<br>
Again here I saw way too much impatience. Everyone NEEDS to know whats going on. Doesn't matter if you've been on 10 dragon raids and dont wanna hear it, there are always dragon newbies there and THEY need to hear it. Once the strategy had been gone over, a couple extra points had been added and everyone was ready I called the GO, to go back in.<br>
<br>
This time I had 10 confirmations of full groups before the charge. We lost one or two down pits cause they went up the wrong ramp, pls be careful peeps. Premature deaths dont help the raid any but I understand that mistakes happen. Once I had a confirmation from all groups and triage and melee lines were ready I started the count down.<br>
<br>
First wave flew in like clockwork, pulling her to the platform beautifully. Wave 2 then came in and surrounded her to keep her there along with the pets. Her life dropped fast as she stood there getting slammed from all sides. At 60 the casters charged in and had no problem staying below her to cast. BEAUTIFUL job tanks on keeping her in one place. Of all my dragon raids I have NEVER seen a more stationary dragon. The only reason she moved was cause she was being stunned and bashed back lol.<br>
<br>
Durring all this do you guys realize she CH'd 3 times? DAAAAMN! Each time she did I assesed how many people we had and all 3 times decided to continue. I'm glad we did, though if I called the command to back off I doubt many would have lol. Its my belief that the reason she didn't move is cause people looked before leaving to see that she wasn't on them. Grats for that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When she fell I was in the process of rememing my spells after my only death. (compared to 8 or 9 last time I'm pretty happy over just 1 death and over 4k dmg done) I heard Flarren tell me that she was down but I almost couldn't believe it. With only 1 ench with Mana Sieve and her CH'ing 3 times I was getting really worried and to hear she was down I had to see it for myself. I entered the chamber and got halway across and there was her body lying prone in the corner WOOHOOO. I couldn't be more happy.<br>
<br>
Loot at that point was handed over to our resident loot manager Creirwyy who figured out what we had and got it all sorted. Thanks to Valoran for going into the pits and getting all the corpses and to Ogun for all the rezzes with his fancy stick.<br>
<br>
Loot included :<br>
<br>
Torbins Eyepatch<br>
100% WR Pouch<br>
Staff of Forbidden Rites<br>
Ice Comet Scroll<br>
<br>
I dont remember exactly what went to who but grats to you all on your wins <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
last note - patience. we started an hour late and we finished over an hour early, be happy! and next time you want to complain of time constraints, understand that most things can NOT be rushed without killing everyone. Put up with it or dont bother with the raid. It can only go so fast and I wont push it faster.<br>
<br>
Be safe all and see you next run.<br>

Special thanks to the management team, Flarren, Langdalen (I must have typed your name wrong a thousand times last nite,lol) and Kommissar.  I apologize with regards to anyone else, as unfortunately I did not know who else was involved.<br>
<br>
Thankyou for entrusting in me, doing the attendance, being a group leader and as well Loot Co-ordinator.  I had a tremendous amount of fun last nite, and met some wonderful new people.<br>
<br>
(hehe it seems the line about I'm not a red-head for nothing, really worked, I must remember that one for the future).  <br>
<br>
**edit** My apologies, as first time loot co-ordinator, I realize now I should have kept the names of who won what loot. Sorry all**<br>
<br>
Also thanks to my awesome team, you not only protected your healer but you died valiently in doing so.  Thankyou Madkat, Goldenmunky, Azketh, Kagaruk and Forarm.  I would be happy to be at your sides any time again.<br>
<br>
**edit** opps re-reading that makes me look like a rather lousy healer.  But the group itself knows what happened.  I don't want to post as I do not wish to embarrass anyone... lol Again You were All Awesome <p><p align="left"><img border="0" src="http://suspect27.homestead.com/files/cretag.jpg" align="left">

First time dragon run, first time dragon kill and a whole hell of a lot of adreneline after we took the scaled wench down.  Good Job everyone!<br>
<br>
Based on what I read from the Naggy raid, I'd say this one ran a bit better.  We did take her down and possibly ahead of schedule.  Looting could have been more organized (ie, the rolling and such), but it wasn't the fault of management, more the fault of people getting antsy and wanting to get stuff done.  My guildmate stayed up probably 'till 4:30, 5am EST for the raid, so i can understand where tired would come into play.<br>
<br>
I'd like to thank everyone involved in running this thing, including (but not limited to) Lagdalen (for being so cool about the little RL situation I had come up right at game time), Flarren (for helping Lagdalen), Creirwyy, for handing out the loot (especially that bag to Zatriz) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , Kellory (my group leader for just plain being cool and making things fun), Ogun? (cleric from valoran that came w/rez stick) and Zatriz, my guildmate, for coming on such short notice.<br>
<br>
I have some great shots of Vox and of the raid itself...if anyone wants to see them, I'll send copies.  Email me at stonescale@hotmail.com to see what I got.  If i figure a way to post them I will, but in the mean time...hehe.<br>

<br>
In all seriousness, I felt that this raid went much smoother than the last I attended.  This was my second raid, and I had not planned on attending.  When Stonescale told me that it might be called off due to lack of attendance, I took up arms and hoofed it to Everfrost (with the help of Kragos(?)).  <br>
<br>
I'm sure I missed a lot of the preliminary groupings wait, but hte groups were done in a matter of minutes after I got there.  We moved in quick, and got to the Flag Room quickly and easily.  Here we did see some &quot;confusion&quot;, mainly people not reading their screens.  In the next room we saw a bit more of that, and a couple times we got SOOOO lucky that people did not start getting summoned by Vox (wandering pets, people running around, doors opening...).<br>
<br>
I lay no blame on Lagdalen or the Raid team.  They did an excellent job.  The blame lies on those who nearly cost us the raid.  I admire Lagdalen for her patience, as I would have called the raid off while in the Flag room.  But then again, that is why I don't lead massive raids like thise one.  We had 10(?) groups there this time.  That is a lot of people to manage, yet people seem to think only of themselves.  About how bored they are, or how troublesome it is to camp out when a pet goes wild, or to stay behind a certain point so we all don't get summoned.<br>
<br>
I highly suggest that a new role be made for raids.... Raid Enforcer.  This person may participate in the raid, but main duty is to watch people.  To take names and decide if that person should be on the raid or future raids.  I wish true enforcement could exist, so the Raid Enforcer could remove the person completely from the Raid if needed.  Tobad Verant added the confirmation box on Translocates.<br>
<br>
All in all, I had a blast.  This was the first time since the Peacekeepers returned to Karana that a Dragon has fallen with Peacekeeper help.  Woot! <p><hr>

I just don't get why people think warnings are jokes.  Leadership was great, showed an immense sense of patience, and dilagence.  If I can get the fire resist gear I'll be at the next raid for naggy (naggy will be next right?) might be hard though for me, being a troll I have much lower starting fire resist.  would like to apologize about the hitting my heal macro a few to many time when I ran to get healed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udoger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Doger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Companion</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/20/01 12:56:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Recap</span><hr size=1> Congratulations to all of you!

It was a night of great fun. I applaud Lag and the rest on their leadership.<br>
<br>
I think , like most, that one of the only problems was some of the attendee's failing to follow simple orders. Pets also seemed to be a big problem. We slaughtered the ice giants to say the least so I think we could probably do without them untill vox her self next time = p<br>
<br>
The vox fight itself was impressive.  My group got the prized exp kill for her too = p I havent been on many vox raids (this being my second) so I dont know what her complete heal looks like, but I did see the message saying she did twice. I thought it incredible we beat her so bad with that happening = ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ustonescalethulefist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stonescale Thulefist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Companion</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/20/01 11:05:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Recap</span><hr size=1> HOLY HELENA...Vox CH'd 3 times???

Thats really funny, I did not realize she did that at all. I thought she'd gotten a 80% heal off(CH is 16khp, so 80% is about12-13k) b/c I saw her go from about 30% to 65%, but jeeze, I didn't realize she did it that much. I malosied, then while it recharge blazed (lava Bolt was resisting or sucking or acting up, waste of mana, only hit like 2x), got oom with her at 10%, sat down to die b/c mobs Always seem to hit u when u sit down, they hate that...sure enough, she did. I came in again after meming nukes, she was down. It was awesome, and for 3CHs, Jeeze! We honestly killed her in about 3 minutes, no joke, that was the FASTEST I've seen her die, 60khp+AE nuke+AE fear+hard hitting in 3 minutes is crazy. I remember laughing Lag b/c u called out 80, 70, then 60 within seconds, seemed u called it as fast as u could type. When I went out there, it was kinda crazy, she had tanks all over, Everywhere, beating her down, she didn't move except when she'd get on her hind legs like she does and roars, lol. Point is, we wasted her so fast, its halarious. We did awesome! Great job all. <br>
