It was hard keeping up with whats going on and then dealing with warnings as well. The whole problem is finding someone charismatic enough to disciplin without alienating themselves from everyone.<br>
<br>
On Vox a threat was required to get people to wake up in flag room. Something along the line of &quot;Fine, either you stay behind Kommisar where you are supposed to or I will be removing you right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the hate raid last night it took a threat once again to get people to start listening. I'm not completely sure yet why it was necessary but after the lack of listening skills I believe that woke some up. Something along the line of &quot;I didn't want this many people nor did I need this many people here. Either smarten up and listen or I WILL start removing people, and if you feel I cant remove you or want to get snitty you WILL NOT LOTTO&quot;.<br>
<br>
I dont want to do that, I shouldn't need to and really our best option might be to find someone to deal with just that. Joke or not, its a good idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Didn't know it was a musing for the raid enforcer, but I do like the idea a lot.  Again, I'd be willing to give it a shot or at least suggest some ideas I have on how I'd prep the masses.  <br>
<br>
I have a few games in mind to keep the people busy while the raid leaders go about doing their bit.  The games I have are geared toward Everfrost area (relay across the frozen river, Simon (Or in my case, Stoney) says, maybe even a mini-staggerfest.  <br>
<br>
With Lavastorm...especially that Lava part, things may be a touch more difficult to work out game wise.  May need to save those for Vox and just go over the discipline stuff for Naggy.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Stoney says&quot; thing would work not only to occupy the minds of the impatient, but to serve as a disciplanary tool as well.  By being able to get people to recognize the people involved faster, the more alert they should be when they see a /shout or piece of text with the raid leader attached to it.  I know it's a spam fest of not only words, but weapon emotes, spell emotes, and people talking in group.  If we can &quot;train&quot; the eye to see a name and recognize it through all of that...discipline should be a little better.<br>
<br>
What I have in mind is to take everyone aside...say to Sol A zone for Naggy run and do the Stoney says thing over there...that way the emotes wouldn't reach the raid organizers.  After a little Stoney says, I'd /shout something to the effect of...<br>
<br>
'May I have your attention please...I will be laying out some general info, so please pay attention.  To acknowledge what I've heard...after every set of info I give in the /shout text, stand up and sit back down'<br>
<br>
'Those of you not sitting yet, please do so now'<br>
<br>
'All those in attendence for the Naggy raid be sure that you have LFG on for the raid commanders.  The faster you do this, the faster they can get things started'<br>
<br>
'Everyone sitting here before me is a part of my stopwatch.  You can do nothing as a piece, but together you can make the watch work.  The better my watch works, the better and faster we can do our jobs'<br>
<br>
'In other words, the more organized we are and the less screwing off we do, the faster we kill that Dragon and the faster some of you East Coast guys go to bed.'<br>
<br>
'This will take time, people, so please be patient.  It will be well worth the patience in the end when we are looting that Dragon instead of looting our own corpses.'<br>
<br>
'Sorting out loot takes about an hour, hour and a half...pulling our corpses and rezzing can take in upwords of 5 hours if we don't kill that wurm.  '<br>
<br>
So if you have patience now, there's no reason we shouldn't be done about an hour after we kill the dragon.'<br>
<br>
'If you're impatient and decide to wonder off or not listen to the orders, prepare to either wait 5 hours after our rush, or find a way to get out of Naggy's lair alone if you can't stay up that long.'<br>
<br>
'For those of you that don't know me, I'm Stonescale Thulefist and I've been assigned the task of Raid Enforcer...I'm here to make sure discipline doesn't have a negative influence on the raid.'<br>
<br>
'From this point until I say otherwise, there will be no emotes or talking in channels other than /tell, unless its' to respond to raid leaders, myself, or people greeting the zone'<br>
<br>
'I assume you're all baseball fans, or at least have the concept of three strikes'<br>
<br>
'If you guys violate a rule laid out by one of the raid leaders, that will be one strike...three strikes and we'll see you at , understand?'<br>
<br>
'For the purposes of this raid, the raid leaders are your Gods.  I follow Cazic-Thule, but for this raid, Lagdalen, Flarren, and Creirwyy are my Gods...you will treat thier word as prophecy.'<br>
<br>
'If one of them tells you to sit, I expect to hear 60 butts hitting the ground in unison...if one of them tells you to jump in the pit of lava behind me...I expect to see 60 people getting up off their butts and bailing into that lava like there's no tomorrow.'<br>
<br>
'They won't tell you to jump in the lava...so don't worry, they will, however, be telling you to sit, stop at this area, pull back, etc.  If they say to back off, BACK OFF, if you choose not to back off, you'll get a swift kick in the leggings from me'<br>
<br>
'This raid is not a democracy, it's a dietic dictatorship, They are your Gods and they tell YOU how, what, and where without question or comment, just do it'<br>
<br>
'I am their archangel, thier messenger...treat my words as if it were thiers.'<br>
<br>
'To review, who are your Gods?'<br>
<br>
'If they tell you to jump into that pool of lava...what will you do?'<br>
<br>
'If I tell you to sit on a bed of spikes, what will you do?'<br>
<br>
I'd have a few commands set up ahead of time in hotbutton form.  &quot;Eyes up&quot; meaning shut up and watch your text...i'd use this if someone was going to make an announcement.  &quot;Watch your pets&quot; before every fight and after we move to a new area, and &quot;Listen to the lady/man&quot; depending on who is leading, it will be the appropriate gender.  I'll use that if people don't listen the first time around.<br>
<br>
This is all up for adapting, but that would give you a general feel for how I'd go about doing it.  I'd let some stuff slide before I gave a strike...verbal warnings i'd give at every lack of discipline though.<br>
<br>
Sorry this was so long...probably got carried away, but that's my pre-raid plan. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Good Journies,<BR>

<br>
The part that interested me the most was about spam.  The text box is only so big, and a lot of things are going to be flying through that little window.  And scrolling back to see what happened, while other things are going on, is a pain.  There are some things that can be done to eliminate a lot of that spam.<br>
<br>
-Turn off spells.  Not just affects, but you can decide whether or not you see &quot;Soandso begins casting.&quot;<br>
<br>
-Turn off other misses.<br>
-Turn off other hits.<br>
-Turn off NPC spells (might be part of the generic spells section up above)<br>
-Turn off NPC hits and misses.<br>
-Turn off all bard songs (so you don't get the message &quot;You mind clears.&quot;)<br>
-I think you can even turn off your hits and misses.  In the end, who cares if you hit or not?  As long as we kill the dragon.<br>
-NO emotes at all.  Ever.  This includes macros.  I think you can even turn off emotes.<br>
-Turn off guildchat and auction.  Might even go so far as to say turn off OOC, but that might be Raid Leader specific.  Some like to use OOC for group leaders only.<br>
-Make sure everyone has /shout enabled, and maybe even have them change the color to red if it is not already (provide instructions on how to do this).<br>
<br>
Doing all this will substantially reduce the amount of text that enters your window, and highlight the text that we want to make sure people read.<br>
<br>
Just more thoughts from a rambling mind. <p><hr>

<br>
Having assisted on the Vox Raid, I felt very frustrated on behalf of Lagadalen and her crew.  Though I was the loot co-ordinator, I was continually stunned watching people open and closing gates and doors.  It was impossible for the raid commander to keep an eye on everything.<br>
<br>
I think it's a brilliant idea, so that the others can do their jobs and do them well to protect us from death, and better yet for a successful raid.<br>

Others hits, misses, and spells to (i think) are turned off as well as most chat lines, except the important ones.  Even with that, stuff flew by pretty fast, I can only imagine what the Warriors go through during a dragon raid, at least with my set up.<br>
<br>
I'd advise that opponent's hits and misses stay on, at least for casters for spell timing...hard to get a spell off if you can't see that you're being hit or at least swung at...just my 2cp.<br>
<br>
Point being...the text can fly by and you can miss stuff...but you'd only need to say it two times at most if anyone is paying attention...that's sort of the idea of the eyes up line of text...to let people know stuff is coming...that way you should only have to say it once.<br>
<br>
If the Enforcer can get people trained to listening to him/her first...or recognizing the name for a set of commands, then the Raid Organizers can get their stuff in once the Enforcer calls them to attention...that's kinda the route I'd take it anyway. <p>Good Journies,<BR>
