I just got out of a raid with my alliance and we did it with no monks, a couple enchanter, a couple cleric and it was extremely smooth. There were 6 groups, most with evacers. I was feigned at the portal and a SK feigned to check the west camp. When clear people staggered zoning by 10 seconds, went to west camp and did not camp out. We fought all the wanders as long as possible. After taking some out, they had to evac. They regrouped and rebuffed and did the same thing, this time with most of the west camp wanderers already dead. So they cleared it easy the second time. It only took like half an hour to break in. Very easy and very smooth. I think we should try that at the next fear raid.  <p>Minkey Munkey of Everquest<BR>

<br>
Are you saying that you made a mad Dash to the West Camp pulling everything between the portal and the camp and then just chipping away at the number of wanderers?<br>
<br>
I like the idea - group 1 goes in - takes mob 1 to half health and evacs, group 2 follows, and finishes mob 1 plus chips away at mob 2 and then evacs, waiting for group 3 to attack mob 2.<br>
<br>
Keep breaking and chipping away at the wanderers and then evacing until they're all gone.<br>
<br>
I've heard this idea before - but it pertained to breaking into fear - as in zoning in - fighting until you had to zone, and then just keep pouring through the portal and evacing as necessary until the portal was clear.<br>
<br>
What I'm curious about is how many wanderers did you aggro?  Conventional wisdom and strategies say that if you get aggro'd to just stand there and die.  How did you manage to run all the way to the west camp - aggroing critters along the way and still not get killed?<br>
<br>
Did all 6 groups engage one mob simultaneously? or did you do it in waves?  When the raid commander called evac did all groups evac, or did groups evac on an as need basis?<br>
<br>
How many deaths did you incur on the break in?<br>
<br>
Sorry bout all the questions - but I'm really curious to see precisely how you guys did this.<br>

When it was as clear as possible, they did make a mad dash to the west camp. Since the zone in was 5-10 seconds apart for the 6 groups, it was a steady flow of people. The immediately engaged anything at the campsite. Evacing when necessary. My group bought it, but most evaced. I was still feigned throughout with the other guy. So after evac, they buffed up again and when it was as clear as possible repeated. But with most camp wanders dead, the second time was easy. The whole process was short and simple. Very few deaths involved too.<br>
<br>
We didn't rotate groups in and out. Everyone zoned in and defended the campsite as long as possible. It was staggered zone in, but everyone was in and fighting. Evac was done only when the battle commander called it. <br>
<br>
We also aggrod very few monsters when all the groups zoned in, we watched. And people who did get aggrod I believe, ran southwestish of portal ending up south of camp out of aggro range to die. Not too sure of that, but I think that what they did. Enchanters played a key part, they were awsome. I couldnt see the battles themselves was I was feigned. I could only hear the shouts. I can ask for more info on the battles of wanderes that occured.<br>
<br>
As far as deaths there were at least 5. My group died cause the wizzie evacer died early. I think we were the only major casualty, with a couple deaths maybe here and there. Recovery was very quick.<br>
<br>
Group 1 and group 2 entered with only a 5 second delay, all the other groups were staggered at 10 second delays.<br>

The biggest problems that have to be looked at when trying the west camp break in is the lvls of the people breaking into the camp, the different times it takes for some people to zone in, and the number and type of mobs surrounding the portal.  If the majority of the people on the raid are 46-51 with little fear experience then west camp break-in can be a nightmare.  I learned this on my first visit to fear while watching 40 people die a repeated number of times within 8hrs of trying unsuccessfully breaking in.  Three mobs can easily jump you right quick at the portal and dispatch one solid group before a wiz or druid can evac.  Then slowly pick off people as they zone into their clutches.  <br>
  To break into west camp it is idealy best to enter after a previous raid while mobs are few and just slowly starting to repop.  It is also wise to have someone run decoy to help clear any congestion of mobs at the portal when groups start pouring in.  Pray that not too many scarelings are up either cause their agro range is long and they tell other mobs that are normaly to far away to aggro that you are there. Communication is also a BIG must for breaking into west camp. People have to call out targets and announce what they are doing quickly.  Discipline and good instincts are a must also.  Things will seem impossible and once again you better be ready to die.<br>
   Another big problem with West camp is the possiblity of total wipeout.  West camp is by far one of the least safe places to perform a res.  If this happens, you have to fight with secondary equipment. If you didn't take out a lot of mobs in the first onslaught, then your chances of breaking it have just gotten worse.  This is when the name calling, crying, and bithing can get ugly. If you do attempt West Camp, Hope that some backup help has been scheduled that can be called in.<br>
<br>
Thats all from my viewpoint,<br>

Everyone dies and clerics die several times trying to camp out safely. I think a good strategy would be to have a west camp watcher, a portal watcher, then a person to kite all the mobs that wander the west camp and portal. WHen he's safely far off kiting, ensured by the two feigners that its clear, everyone zones in and prepares for battle. The person kiting then feigns or dies and the wanders will slowly walk back and the west camp can then take them out. The feigner can then eventually make his way back. I spoke to my friend in Eternal Wrath and this is pretty much their technique and they consistently do it successfully. They use call of the hero to get the feigner back to camp. We probably wont have that spell but I think the feigner can inch is way back using feign and LD.  <p>Minkey Munkey of Everquest<BR>

I think both methods have their merits, but both can also still benifit from improvements.  The North wall method can probably be improved by focusing more on getting the cleric camped safely than getting people to the north camp, so in my mind, it may be still worthwhile investigating that one again.  And I agree, West camp is quicker, but has disadvantages also. <p><HR>

<br>
I was the 2nd FD'er there with Minkey that night and have to say that having one person FD at the portal top and second FD halfway down the hill to the west camp works great...<br>
<br>
However, when the FD person tells the other groups to zone in there must not be any visible mobs close to the portal or camp and everyone still must zone in invised. <br>
<br>
Timing is crucial because you have about 60 seconds until another roamer makes his way back near the portal area.<br>
<br>
I have done this many times now and it works 75% of the time.<br>
<br>
A second tatic that works well if the portal area is packed with mobs is to take 2-3 powerful groups in, make mad dash to the west camp, and kill as many roamers as you can before evacing out..<br>
<br>
Usually the next time you zone in the portal area will be somewhat clear.<br>
