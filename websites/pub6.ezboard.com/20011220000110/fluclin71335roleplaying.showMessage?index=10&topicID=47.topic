Feudil Gimmley and Lady Larisian had said their vows to each other a couple of hours ago.  There was much rejoicing at the reception, with plenty of Booze provided by Lady Tarnia, along with wedding cake for all, courtesy of Mumsley.<br>
<br>
As the newly married couple strolled the path from Felwithe to Kelethin admiring their surroundings, Squire Ican followed close behind.<br>
<br>
The couple came over a rise on the path to see Kelethin insight.  They continued to walk along the path towards Kelethin and a honeymoon night that would not be forgotten.<br>
<br>
As they reached the bottom of the rise Larisian turned to make sure her Squire was following behind.  When she turned he was not there.  She expected him to come over the rise any second now.  She waited a few more seconds and he still failed to crest the rise.<br>
<br>
Larisian told Feudil to stay put on the path while she went to look for her Squire.  She ran back up the path and over the crest to see only and empty trail.  As she backtracked along the path she happened upon and area that looked like a scuffle had occured.  She called out for Ican but did not get any response. Now she hurried back up the path towards Feudil, worried for his safety.<br>
<br>
She never felt afraid in her homelands.  They were always safe.  What has happened to Ican?<br>
<br>
As she came over the crest she arrived just in time to see a dreadful sight.<br>
<br>
A band of Dark Elves and Ogres were surrounding Feudil.  He tried to fight them off but there were too many.<br>
<br>
Larisian let out a scream and charged with blades drawn.  With this scream the attackers turned to face her.  As she drew near a large Thundering sound rang out through the air.  Just as she got within striking distance the entire group disappeared before her into a Mystic Portal, and were gone.<br>
<br>
Larisian fell to her knees, stunned at the events that had just taken place.  As she knelt there trying to collect her thoughts she felt something whistle by her ear and strike the tree next to her.  She turned to see an arrow embedded into the trunk of a tree with a parchemt attached to it.<br>
<br>
She got up and walked to the tree removing the arrow and opening the pachment.  She began to read:<br>
<br>
&quot;We the followers of Rukkas, Leader of Severed Souls, have taken capture two halflings of your order.  These halflings will be put to work serving us until they die.  We have taken them in return of your unjust acts towards us.  Do not attempt to rescue them as you and your order will meet your demise.  How does it feel to be a wife and widow on the same day?&quot;<br>
<br>
Larisian screamed at the top of her lungs after reading this.<br>
<br>
&quot;With the power that has been given to me, With the oath I ahve taken to uphold all that is good and honorable, We the Order of Emerald Phoenix declare War on those that are affiliated with Severed Souls.  You shall all meet your maker soon&quot;<br>
<br>
She rose to her feet, wiping the tears from her eyes, and ran down the path to Kelethin.  There would be much preparation necessary to attack and rid this land of the evil Severed Souls. <p><FONT SIZE="+1">Be Safe!  Have Fun! No Dying!</FONT><BR>

The Severed Souls stock of supplies was beginning to run low and time to restock had come. <br>
<br>
Rakkas, ogre shadowknight and leader of one of the tribes oldest families, had been the first to notice the shortage and snatched up two of their newly found workers to go out with him and get new stock. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hury up dum hafling! GRR! Yus muvin to slo and Rak is hungry!!&quot; the ogres barks.<br>
<br>
Ican looks at his halfling friend and sighs. &quot;I am not sure how much longer I can take being here serving these oafs&quot; he whispers to his small companion Feudil. <br>
<br>
Feudil nods slowly so as not to alert the ogre of their communicating back and forth.<br>
<br>
&quot;RAK! RAK!&quot; a yell comes from down the trail. The figure of a troll appears on the trail running top speed toward the ogre and his captives. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dat band of pale skins is formin up ova by da mowntins of rath! Me seen dem wen me wuz on me way to barsh stufs in da lake! Wut dey doin heer? Wut dey tinkin?!&quot; Frakk says excitedly.<br>
<br>
The ogre growls &quot;Rak bet dey tink dey getin deez twu bak. HA!&quot; he kicks one of the halflings in the shoulder sending him tumbling down a small hill.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grab dat one der an go tell Ruk wut goin on. Me keep dis one wit me an get redy to smash deez liteys&quot; Rakkas commands.<br>
<br>
With a nod Frakk dashes off into the gloom of the forest and heads for the Souls gathering hall.<br>
<br>
&quot;RUKKAS!&quot; comes a shout from the entrance of the hall. The ogre shaman turns to see what the commotion is and sees one of the Souls proud members dashing through the halls towards him. Breathing heavily Frakk gives the news of the Emerald Phoenix and their arrival to the forest.<br>
<br>
&quot;HA! dey com fer dey litle frends huh? GUD DEN LETS SEE IF DEY CAN TAKE DEM BAK!!&quot; the ogre roars. <br>
<br>
Orders are bellowed through the tribe's halls and fighters that had not left for further hunting grounds are assembled and prepped for battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dis wut we gona do. Yus yung Souls go out der an keep dis litle one Frakk got heer safe. Take him wit yus so dem Feenix bashas can see wut we got. Let dem see dat we got him an not letin him go! HEHA! Ruk go find Rak and see wut udder olda souls me can get togedda and we keep da udder hafling wit us. Yus all no fite neer us cuz yus no can do much agenst dem olda seezon fitas. Kill dem yung ones we handle da old. Now GO!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fighters of various classes pour out of the tribe's entrance. Iksar warrior's, dark elf magicians, troll shadowknights and several others make up the entourage that is to take on the Emerald Phoenix hunters. <br>
<br>
Rukkas runs out into the forest and meets up with his brother Rakkas and an esteemed fighter in the Souls named Ariakane. The two shadowknights stand before the orkhalla grinning and postured for battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid it will be just us defending this halfling they seek orkhalla&quot; Ariakane states &quot;many of our older hunters are not in this realm at this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, dats ok. We take on wuteva dey toss at us an kill dem ded!&quot; Rukkas says.<br>
<br>
With that said a shout comes from out of the darkness of the forest. &quot;We have come for our family that you have foolishly taken you beasts! Arm yourselves and prepare to fall!&quot;<br>
<br>
A pack of wolves charge out of the dense forest toward the small band of fighters. Rukkas clutches the halfling tight and begins to cast. Ariakane and Rakkas ready their blades and stand ready for the charging wolves. <br>
<br>
The first to attack was one named Snakeater a ranger of many seasons. The shaman's casting was finished and the ranger's frenzy was drastically slowed. His bites much less rapid than what he had hoped and now much less dangerous. More wolves came pouring out of the darkness and moved in between the shaman and his shadowknight fighters. The ogre shaman spots what his brother is fighting a short distance away and begins to cast once again. A force of energy slams into Rukkas and stuns him and interupts his casting. Now surrounded Rukkas can no longer see where his companions are fighting. Attacks come from all sides biting and kicking. He tightens his grasp on the captive and runs off into the dark forest trying to distance himself from his attackers so he may launch an offensive attack of his own. <br>
<br>
Rakkas was off a good distance away from both his brother and Ariakane. The number of attackers and the frenzy of the attack had separated the three. The ogre shadowknight was determined that if he were to fall this day there would be at least one that fell with him from the assailaint's tribe. He swung his sword wildly hacking and chopping at one of the wolves that attacked him. He too had attacks coming from all sides but remained focused on the one directly before him. The ogre unleashed a furious attack making the wolf he focused on writh in the grip of agony and with another swing of his vindicator sword sent the wolf crumpling to the ground unconscious. He turned his attention to the next attacker. Feeling his energy slowly slip away with each attack the ogres swings lessened in intensity. Suddenly all he saw was black and was no longer aware or concerned with the fighting around him as he falls heavily to the ground.<br>
<br>
With one of the defenders down more attention could be focused on the shaman which was their next target. Surrounded now the shaman had very little hopes of landing his offensive spells to take down his attackers. The wild dogs bit and kicked at the ogre slowly draining his life from him. Stabbing wildly with his spear Rukkas was intent on damaging the Phoenix members as much as he could to make them pay for their boldness. Very low on health the ogre runs to a safe spot again so that he may heal himself so he can in turn inflict more damage on his attackers. Feeling better the ogre stabs at the wolves again who continue to bite at him and continue to interupt the ice blasts he attempts to land. Again he begins to feel weak as the attacks take their toll on him. Rukkas starts to cast a heal when a wolf bashes him from behind. Spell interupted and short on health the ogre tries again. A blast of energy slams into the ogres large body stunning him. Another blast of energy follows shortly behind knocking the ogre to the ground and rending him unconscious.<br>
<br>
Ariakane was now the only elder hunter remaining. He ran in the shadows, popping out at different times and in different locations hacking at the enemies that had taken down his family members. Doing all that he could to aggravate the Phoenix elders he continued to pick at them slowly. The dark elf popped out of the shadows to launch an attack on one of the shaman that had his back exposed to him landing his blade with full force square into the shaman's back. The shaman's pet viciouslt attacked Ariakane and soon the pack of wolves that had taken down the ogre duo were on Ariakane as well. It was not long before the bites and kicks along with the blasts of energy took their toll on the dark elf shadowknight. Fighting hard and vigilantly Ariakane too was overcome.<br>
<br>
By this time the fighting among the younger hunters in both organizations had also begun. The battle here was magnificent. Blows were exchanged on both sides, spells were being cast and finding their target in full force. One by one fighters from both sides fell, but in this case the Phoenix hunters were falling more quickly than the defending Souls. Soon the rescue team for the Emerald Phoenix was down to its last attacker and then there were none. <br>
<br>
The invaders had rallied together and retreated from the forest taking Ican with them. All the fallen Phoenix fighters were gathered up and taken back with them and the fallen Souls slowly rose to their feet.<br>
<br>
The Phoenix had come in and taken back one of their own on this day, but the other, the one they call Feudil, was still in Severed Souls hands.<br>
<br>
The Souls assemble on the bridge in the forest and Rukkas looks at his family of fighters. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yus all did gud taday. Dey took one of dem haflings bak frum Ruk but yus all stil got dis one. Dey gona pay fer comin in heer. Dey gona pay fer takin bak wut we take frum dem. Dey gona pay.&quot;<br>

The normally still depths were unusually alive with shiny scales and hungry teeth, attracted to this spot by the blood and gore that even now continued to drip and ooze into the water below.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhhhh...dat feelz guud&quot; he sighed to himself.<br>
<br>
Baiting his hook with another chunk of congealed blood he threw out his line again, whistling happily as he glanced at the heap of toothy monstrosities he had pulled from the swirling river so far. The catch was always better after a battle had taken place near its' edges....<br>
<br>
His eyes glazed over as the details of the night before ran through his mind. Absentmindedly scratching his bum it all came back to him.....<br>
<br>
...the discovery of the enemy massing at the fringes of the Souls' stomping ground, intent no doubt on rescuing their lost comrades...the alert being delivered and the cries of &quot;To Arms!!&quot;...the members of the tribe who were present rushing gleefully to bash the impudent intruders...Orkhalla Rukkas decreeing that the new slaves be brought to taunt their erstwhile rescuers with...the decree that the tribe split into two forces to better meet the threat on equal terms...the --<br>
<br>
&quot;AYUH!!!!!&quot; he bellowed.<br>
<br>
 Frakk hastily yanked his feet out of the cool soothing waters -and caught himself as he reached for his huge two handed sword which lay by his side-<br>
<br>
&quot;INNUTHULE'S BALLS!!!&quot; he cursed, locking his huge gnarled hands in a death grip around the head of a loathsome leechlike creature, which in turn had all of Frakk's right foot inside of its' maw, he squeezed with all his considerable trollish might..and fell over backwards onto the bridge, pulling the rest of the 12 foot creature over the rail on top of him... <br>
<br>
After composing himself Frakk cursed himself for not noticing the slimy caress of its' probing maw in time, but then smiled as he thought of the stew he would make of it later...he recast his line and let his feet drop down again after turning his beady eyes to the waters for a full minute first...<br>
<br>
&quot;Now werr wuz I...oh yah!&quot;<br>
<br>
...the Elders crossing the bridge to meet their foes...the somewhat younger members staying on the near side-taking their hostage deep into the forest, counting on their familiarity of its' dark recesses to grant them opportunity for ambush of the interlopers...then the battle of the Elders!...cries of Vengeance Sworn! and Defiance echoing through the leaves and mists...against the superior numbers of the massed Emerald Phoenix Guild the Elders falling in combat, unable to overcome such odds..we, the younger members chafing at our inaction...the supposed craft of the tree huggers and wilderness walkers failing to bring them to us...finally unable to take it anymore we run to the bridge!...our warparty meeting the disgusting little creatures on the bridge...the battle ensues!...we swear revenge!...we clash...mighty Qamar and Slithers fighting alongside...the crafty Vallaes with his elemental servant...the blood and sparks flying as Frakk helps to cut down two of the vermin down personally...a red haze covers all...though some tribe members fall the battle is won...and the carnage is shared by both sides...as are the victories, and the losses..........<br>
<br>
Frakks' toes jerk out of the water as he is startled by a nearby lizardman emerging from the darkness, both stare at each other and the lizard wisely chooses to back away into the mists.<br>
<br>
Discovering his pole has broken Frakk gathers up his dinner and breakfast into his favorite bags, pulling his boots on he notices the pools of sticky gooey gore, unable to dry due to everpresent mists and cool dampness. His eyes grow large as inspiration comes into his small brain, with painstaking toil he manages to scrape up a considerable amount of the slimy detrius left over from the lifesblood spilled here so recently, filling his upturned helmet with it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dis maek a grate bastin soss for dese fishies! De udders are sure to want da resipee!&quot;<br>
<br>
 Frakk grins widely to himself, happy and dreaming of more lighty bashing to come...and sweet revenge for the losses suffered...strolling up the path he could almost taste the flesh of the ones who would fall to the Tribe...<br>
<br>
&quot;Har har! Dey iz gunna be soo jellus of my fishies tonight!&quot;<br>
<br>
A discordant whistling fades with him into the fog, and a chuckle echos softly mingled with the heavy receding footsteps...<br>
<br>
<br>
