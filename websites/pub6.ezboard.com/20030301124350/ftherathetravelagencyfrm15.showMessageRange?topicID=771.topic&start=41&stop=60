<br>
I think you and Thundax disagree on this particular point:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> UBER guilds blaming US for setting up camp at the safest place in a given zone<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I can see Thundax's side of the argument more clearly than yours. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A zone line is not safe.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> If I was playing my cleric and I got an overpull, I would run to the zoneline. Half the time I'd be too busy strafe running / jumping to even think about typing /shout Train To Zone (and I don't have a hotkey, nor would I have time to press it if I'm going as fast as I can which requires both my hands)... why get killed (possibly far out where CR is vastly more complicated) trying to warn people who likely as not won't even move, just die themselves and complain that you trained them?<br>
<br>
I don't train people on purpose, nor do I tolerate those who do. But when I see a train coming my way, I don't sit there wondering why &quot;train to zone&quot; hasn't been called. Basic survival instincts kick in. 'This is the highway. That is a truck. I'm in the way. Time to go.'<br>
<br>
If you want to camp somewhere other than the highway, you can make the argument for the &quot;safest point in a given zone&quot; ... but I for one would never call a zoneline in ME &quot;safe&quot; ! Particularly when two of them are guarded by see-invis SK type mobs which means that if you hang around long enough for a darkness to land on you, you are dead. Say nothing of the harmtouch.<br>
<br>
Uber guilds aren't trying to train you, and it isn't that they don't care. Mistakes happen. If you have problems with LOM, that's the link to our board. If you have problems with uber guilds in general, I can't help you there. <br>

<br>
 Well this is the problem, no in probably 99% of the time the trains are not done on purpose. But the statement that they just don't care in not correct in my opinion. This is a case of people not taking the time to be careful where they are going. I have seen many references to getting out of the way of cars or not sitting on the tracks. If people took care of where they were going in the first place, and not running blindly around across zones, or around walls to get from point A to B, this problem could be reduced. You see this problem in dawnshrouds a lot a well, there for some strange reason people seem to follow the wall around from NL to ME zones, blindly training a dozen or so mobs that pop in the wall traps as they go. Half the time they are not even aware they have a train. Take the time to learn the safest path across a zone people, sometimes its not the wall or a straight line. As to camping the zone lines not being safe and expecting trains as a result. Who in this game can honestly say they never set up a camp at any zone lines? We all have done it , we all will do it. Trains are a part of the price of the location. You expect some people to head for zone because of over pulls. That's why you are camped there yourself! The trains people are complaining about,are those caused by people crossing the zone dragging everything in their path behind them! It gets old real quick when a large guild has a raid planned that is several zones deeper in than the one you are set up in. Having ten people go by at various times pulling zone trash like a vacuum cleaner is irresponsible. <p>"To Dream the impossible dream<BR>

If you hug the zone wall...up high...how do you run into 12 skeletal drudges?  Even if it wasnt 12 more than 1 or 2 suggests that the person ran through the field of them between DS and AR zone lines.<br>
<br>
Now its one thing to get a SoE and a invis at the entrance to ME and haul ass through the MIDDLE of the zone KNOWING full well that your invis will drop by the time you get to AR or UP.  Then you can use the excuse..well my invis dropped.  Shiat.....ya ok.  <br>
<br>
How about you....get a SoE and Invis THEN follow the ZONE LINE.  Is it really that hard?  If you agro then /ooc....<br>
<br>
Really anyone bringing more than 3 to the Entrance (not counting the ones in the building) of the building is a person who has no concern for others ie a Piece of shit.  <br>
<br>
Now to say well there are 6 in the building.....do you come into the building and go to the far right or left?  Or do you run as close to the middle as possible so you can agro all of the mobs in the building?<br>
<br>
If you stay high on the wall you can avoid large trains quite easily....even without invis......Frankley its quite easy not to train at all.  Sometimes you might have to wait for a mob to pass but I believe this whole issue could be solved with a little patience and concern for others when traveling to kill that uba mob. <p><center><BR><font color= Blue><BR><i>Granitfist/Jeribu<i/><BR><i>GrandMaster/High Priest<i/><BR><i>Co-Leader of Circles End<i/><BR><i>The Rathe<BR><center><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370733">The Monk </> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370756">The Cleric<i/>

<br>
Ok, youre right, you dont see my point. My point has nothing to do with where it is safe to camp...that is THEIR point to defend their rediculous lack of consideration and utter laziness. <br>
<br>
MY point is, that I KNOW trains happen, and if they do so be it, but when you KNOW youre going through a dangrous zone where you WILL pick up mobs along the way <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> AT LEAST TRY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!!! You have upwards of what?? 100 people in your guild some 30 of which are going to a given zone and you cant have ONE sit at a zone in and give invises??? Lots of other guilds do, we need to because some of our members wont make it across certain zones without invis. But big strong you can so screw it if you pull 14 mobs over anyone medding/camping/running in the opposite direction along the way.<br>
<br>
This is about courtesy, and caring about your fellow player. The attitude that people like thunderax show is that we dont need the rest of the server because were too uber, if you dont like what we do, dont be where were going. Im just sick of people defending this lack of courtesy by saying that its your fault for being in an unsafe camp spot...no its YOUR fault for being lazy. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen

<br>
There's a few things to think about here:<br>
<br>
1) /ooc does not show up well, trains should be /shouted<br>
<br>
2) running around the zone wall in ME from DSP/ME to ME/UP, you must either go by the Ruins on the left, which may contain see invis mobs, or past Akheva, which may contain see invis mobs.  Either way you *may* cause a train, no matter how good the intentions.<br>
<br>
3) having invis drop, while you're running along the zone wall to UP, in either direction, will cause a train, there's no way around it<br>
<br>
4) &quot;get to know the zone (DSP)&quot;. Most of the folks who 'run thru' DSP were 60 before Velious came out.  For them to hunt in DSP long enough to get to know the zone, will cause mucho bitterness from the folks that actually hunt there for exp.<br>
<br>
5) VI has put the Dawnshroud Portal In where mobs roam.  Porting in there, the druid or wizard will be visible.  If any mobs are there before they can invis, they might cause a train of those 'traps' when they're hauling ashes to the ME zone.<br>
<br>
6) If someone's invis goes down and 99% of the folks on the Raid are already there, there isn't anyone to hand out invis for the run thru the intervening zones.  If they ask, will you invis them?  I've *heard* folks asking for invis's at the zone line, and most times their plea goes unanswered.<br>
<br>
There are as many causes for an inadvertant train as there are reasons to be angry at them. <p>Muse Nycah Aries'Syrensong<BR>

<br>
Explain to me how the laziness of setting up camp right in everyone's way so you can zone if need be, then bitching at people for coming through to use that zone line shows consideration for your fellow players? Forty of us need to get from point A to point B, we don't WANT to inconvenience you five, but you're directly in our path - how are you showing us any consideration? Why not choose a spot that is not directly in the path of anyone coming to Akheva? How are you showing us consideration? Particularly when we take the time afterward to CR you and get flamed for it? This goes both ways, Hutterr, it's not just &quot;the little man&quot; vs &quot;the big man&quot; here.<br>
<br>
For the record, neither Ghalid nor I recieved tells. I do not know if Ravenwind did. There were not 12 drudgies, I came back out and saw three parked on top of a few corpses. You want facts, stick to facts. You want hyperbole, enjoy yourself, but I myself prefer facts and reasoned debate to tall tales to support &quot;the little guy&quot;.<br>
<br>
Courtesy, why heavens, might also be defined as not camping right where forty other people need to run through. The chance of mistakes happening is too great to assume we're all going to make it without a single train. I'm not going to assume that, I'm a realist and the numbers back me up. Frankly, I was pretty shocked to find a group huddled around the corner when I ran by. That's got to be one of the worst places to camp, since people coming won't even know you're there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> until they are on top of you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Again, why call train if you have no reason to believe the area is camped?<br>
<br>
I know I'm being a little objective here, but explain to me how five people camping directly in the path of forty others, out of the line of sight so the forty won't even know they're there until it's too late, is considerate? How is it not lazy? Why not go camp somewhere more difficult where people will not be running through? I'm not taking the side of the &quot;Uber&quot; guilds, I just want to know why anyone is going to camp a zone line where people consistantly run through because trains are essentially inevitable when a guild decides to raid there? Where is the logic?<br>

<br>
This arguement isn't even worth having in my opinion.  The same thing happened to me the other day.  Me and 5 other people from various mid-game guilds were hunting in ME for experience at the Umbral Plains zone.  League of Levity came burning through to...I dunno...I assume they were killing Rumblecrush.<br>
<br>
The 6 of us saw LoL people begin to file though, and realizing that they are a quite large guild, we understood that we would be constanly trained for about 15 minuted while they all got their way to UP.  I would say we were trained 8-10 times, most with the mobs right there nerar the UP zone.<br>
<br>
We positioned ourselves in a manner to avoid the trains while still fighting, and when LoL had moved in completely, we resumed hunting at our normal spot.  We understood that a large number of people needed to file through, and that trains were going to happen, and we did not feel that the members of LoL did anything wrong.  We made way for them as to make things go as smoothly as possible for both parties.<br>
<br>
There has been this huge wave of people spewing forth excess melodramatic bullshit lately.  Grow up.<br>

<br>
How about you do the same thing we all learned back in Crushbone or Blackburrow, and assume the zoneline has people nearby, camping it or not?  That is just as sad an excuse and rationalization as Thundax's bullshit excuse about &quot;don't camp where I'm running&quot;.  Why?  Because it IS the same excuse.  If you are going to train a zone, ANY zone, call it.  Period.  Assume there might, just maybe, be someone there.  Why?  Because there probably is.  And if not, what have you lost?  All of 3 seconds hitting your Train hotkey in your 5th set of 100 hotkeys you can have?  Because if you don't call it, and there IS someone there, you look like the asshole, not them.<br>
<br>
Following the wall nets you no see invis mobs.  COH works in ME.  Invis and hugging the zone wall works in ME and results in a hell of a lower chance than just barreling up the middle.  Just because you have 40 people going to a raid doesn't mean you get to be a prick about it and blame people for &quot;camping on the freeway&quot;.  Show some consideration and hug a wall, it's not hard.<br>
<br>
To recap:<br>
There shouldn't have been a train if the people moving through followed high on the zone wall invis (hell even without invis you'd be incredibly lucky if you manage to pick up a mob, much less several).<br>
<br>
Even when there was a train, it should have been called, regardless of whether you &quot;think&quot; the zoneline is camped or not.  That is EQ 1-OH-fucking-1.<br>
<br>
If you trained them, and didn't call it, the LEAST you can do is res them, and then apologize, instead of being an ass and blame them for &quot;camping in the wrong spot&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhutterr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hutterr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/15/02 6:26:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=771.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Trains</span><hr size=1> Let me clarify again. This isnt a problem JUST in ME. It happens in LOTS of zones. I TOTALLY understand the risks of camping a zoneline (which I dont do BTW, but thats not the point) because as nycah said, shit can happen for all kinds of reasons. When it does, we all jsut have to deal with it.<br>
<br>
My PROBLEM is that this isnt the case most of the time. Almost ALL of the trains to zonelines are ONLY because people are too inconsiderate to get an invis. You tried to use the &quot;its your fault&quot; shit on me again, and its NOT. If you can honestly say that I am being inconsiderate for setting up a camp ANYWHERE with a strait face, I applaude your ability to completely ignore reality. <br>
<br>
My camp poses ZERO threat to you. In fact, theoretically, it ENCOURAGES you to be safer than you all seem to want to be. If you invised, you would simply be safer than just running, period. <br>
<br>
Your train however, poses SERIOUS threat to anyone even remotely close to a zoneline or any area in your general path...but IM inconsiderate.<br>
<br>
For those that need a recap:<br>
<br>
1) Trains DO happen despite precautions<br>
2) Trains can be minimized if those travelling use a little (un)common sense and (un)common courtesy and actually take the time and effort to use those precautions.<br>
3) No matter WHAT, a trainer CANNOT reasonably argue that a train is the TRAINEES fault. By definition thats not possible.<br>

<br>
Hutterr and some others seem to have taken that from my post that I train people all the time and don't bother looking out for other people.<br>
<br>
I use invisi everywhere. I spent aa points on Innate Camo so that I have instant click invisible. It is unusual for me to run through any zone without invisi, even if the mobs are too low to attack me.<br>
<br>
If there is a zone wall to follow to make it safer, I follow it. I am 100 percent in agreement that people should try to avoid causing trains.<br>
<br>
If my guild is moving to a zone for a raid, and there is a train and some people get killed, I personally see that they are CRed and ressed safely. <br>
<br>
In the very rare event that I cause a train, I will call it. Again there is no reason not to.<br>
<br>
The point of my previous post was that trains will always happen to zone lines, and sometimes those trains will not be called. I guess if you really want to camp at a zoneline, it is your business, but what I said before is that you then can't really complain if you get trained. I have been playing for 3 and a half years, and from Crushbone to Ssra Temple, there are trains.<br>
<br>
Karadin posted about the various ways to lessen the chances of causing a train, and I agree with him. In most zones it is fairly simple to avoid causing a train. Probably the hardest one is running to Ssra Temple through The Grey. The large number of traps with see invisi mobs means there is a good chance you will get seen by something.<br>
<br>
No matter how easy it is to not train, sometimes there will still be trains, and those trains will mostly end up at zonelines.<br>
<br>
If you think that maybe one out of 10-20 people running to Akheva from DSP will bring a train, then when you consider a raid of 50 people running there, it can surely not be surprising when there are a few trains. Also, some mobs in ME do see invisi. Once there is an initial train, it is highly likely that plenty of other people will run into that same see invisi mob as it is leaving the Akheva area. Even if the person had taken every step possible to avoid training such as getting an invisi and following the wall, once they get near the Akheva building they will probably still agro the see invisi mob that is leaving the area and cause a train that way.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am sure someone will read this and take one point out of context and flame me for it again. I hope you have fun.<br>

<br>
You ARE right that trains will happen despite the precautions, and its generally not advisable to camp zonelines, and I dont promote that. I have had SO many people argue the point that they dont need to invis, cause if you camp the zoneline, youre an idiot and should expect it.<br>
<br>
Thats the attitude I dont like and simply refuse to tolerate. You obviously dont feel that way and I may have tried to read into your original post jsut what I wanted to see.<br>
<br>
I think my points however are still valid and truly hope that everyone at least makes the effort to avoid the trains, call them when they cant avoid them, and offer some compassion (or even help) when they train. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen

We were NOT at the zone line.  yes we had been there for most of the afternoon/evening with nary an incident, but at the time of this foolishness, we had just gotten through rezzing and CoTH'n folks from DSP.  Why were we CoTH'ing?  Those were folks that had never been to ME and/or the Akheva zone.  We were rezzing because a few attempted to make a run for it and failed... reeeeally bad.  <br>
<br>

Hmmm... so what you are saying is that even though we had been there for hours with no troubles from anyone else that we should be omniscient and just KNOW when you are planning to raid a given zone, then make way for you so you don't have to go to any extra effort in haphazardly streaking across a zone and picking up whatever happens to be around?

Again, we weren't directly in the path.  as a matter of fact, since we were on the spawn point, the person that dropped the train on us wasn't even trying to NOT train.  <br>

<br>
I don't want to train people, and I'll avoid it if I can, but sheesh when forty people are trying to get something done and five are in the way it's not the &quot;little man&quot; being run over by &quot;the big man&quot; ... it's not the uber guilds being assholes... it's a lot simpler than that. <br>
<br>
When 40 people try to get through ME, a train is almost bound to happen. Camping directly in it's path is a risk you are free to take, but don't expect 40 people to derail themselves... there's 40 of them and 5 of you, chances are half of them won't even notice you're there. People aren't being malicious, they're being people in a pack mind. &quot;GET TO AKHEVA&quot; ... off they go, in a mess. People in the way are probably going to get trained, no matter how uber the guild is, because the more people you have, the greater chance someone is going to make a mistake or just be lazy.<br>
<br>
It's simple - I'm infuriated by people being so melodramatic about this. It's just basic probability. 40 people are a lot more likely to screw up than one person is, and even one person can screw up really easily in ME. This isn't uber guilds picking on lowbies, anyone saying that is just spouting ignorance. If you want consideration, try taking it from the raid of 40 people's point of view - they're being told to get from point A to point B as fast as possible so no one's time is wasted (we have lives we'd like to have time for!). They're not coming at you with a train and malicious intent, heck they don't even know you're there! They have other concerns. If we see you dead because of our actions, we'll rez you, because we certainly didn't intend to kill you. I will remind the guild to yell trains at all times in the future.<br>
<br>
But for the love of god, quit the melodrama... (again, not directed at Barrd)<br>
