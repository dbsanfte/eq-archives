We start heading to the shroom fort to get a more steady exp.  On the way there a 30ish BST (Barbonian was the name) ran past us saying he was going to camp the entire fort and not share ( i am serious he actually said that).  We blew him off since we were a group of 5 and he was one.  Blah blah trash talkin to us...makes a train dies.<br>
<br>
Next thing we know a high (guessin 50ish +) lvl monk comes up (how odd that the BST logged off)  He comes up and in the same stupid tone says how he is gonna camp the entire fort and train us if we try to take his kills.  His first attempt was unsuccessful.  we survived the 10 mob train. (shrooms and lightcrawlers).  He then told us that he was going to get a bigger one (what is this guy, nuts?)  Sure enough.  Next thing i know i am blinded (lightcrawler) and the whole group but 1 dies.<br>
<br>
Blah blah he keeps talking trash.  So now during CRs the group is waiting at SS zone. He has just trained the one guy who survived as he was trying to get corpses.  The who should appear at SS but Goloin the same monk who killed us the first time.  Now he has i am guessing 50 mobs around him.  Kills us again (hard to zone blinded) claims he was trying to get the mobs to kill the guards.<br>
<br>
Just had to vent and honestly hope to give this guy Goloin and Barbonian a bad rap. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzutentsunami>Tzuten Tsunami</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/31/03 7:28:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1021.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Can you say...ASS?</span><hr size=1> guilded or not? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mammor@therathetravelagency>Mammor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/31/03 7:54:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1021.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Anon</span><hr size=1> they were both anon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pocketsfullofgold@therathetravelagency>Pockets FullOfGold</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/31/03 8:08:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1021.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Anon</span><hr size=1> <br>
Next time you want to know what guild someone is in, to see if they are guilded and are Anon, type /guildstat *playername*  You have to type out the entire players first name and you have to be in the same zone as the player in question.  It will show what guild they are in, if they happen to be guilded, and it will show if they are an officer in that guild as well.<br>

In regards to cursed, we could have been there with our full raid, but I decided to ask first.  Apparently now you can't try cursed unless it is your turn for glyphed/exiled.  It was BoTS' turn for cursed and they didn't seem like they were in a hurry to get there.  Since losing to cursed doesn't blow his trigger like AoW, why isn't he open like a normal rot?  As long as a previous guild has downed glyphed/exiled before you try there should be no problem.  Otherwise it appears that the rulemakers are trying to keep people off the cursed rotation for as long as possible.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aandiian>Aandiian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/31/03 11:06:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1021.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In regards to cursed, we could have been there with our full raid, but I decided to ask first.

Cursed will despawn after being up for 30 minutes, and you have to wait another 2 hours for the TM's to respawn, then start the whole cycle all over again.  So while it doesn't blow the spawn, it does delay the guild up for cursed cleanup, a couple hours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vincecross>Vincecross</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://bellsouthpwp.net/v/i/vincecrs/necromancer.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 662<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/31/03 11:07:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1021.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://bellsouthpwp.net/v/i/vincecrs/necromancer.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> First of all, every time you do your own Glyphed/Exiled you have the opertunity to try Cursed, the Rot isnt that long.<br>
And you can try as many times as you like on your day (IE you cant  cont the next day claimin you havent past)<br>
<br>
2nd the you dont try  cursed unless its your   G/E turn has been around since NB first entered the rotation.<br>
<br>
3rd When you enter an Rotation you agree to the rules that the previous people who set up the rotation make, once your on you have the option to open discussion for a rule change.<br>
<br>
Cursted is Tied in with 3 other mobs and thats why you dont try em on your non days off, the longer cursed is up the longer before you can &quot;reset&quot; the cycle the more cursed are waisted. If you cant wait the 4 or 5 cycles to try cursed I call you impatient. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mammor@therathetravelagency>Mammor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/31/03 12:35:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1021.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Paluian60</span><hr size=1> I did not know about the /guildstat command and he was of course anon.

and as for glyphed / exiled / cursed<br>
<br>
<br>
you guys are wrong about delaying for 2hours LMAO<br>
<br>
u kill all mobs, buff up, kill glyphed = 45 min<br>
<br>
med up rez fallen (if any) kill exiled = another 15-20min<br>
<br>
med/buff up kill cursed (or try to) = 30ish min <br>
<br>
(times are estimates, may take longer depending if ld's or not these are mid case scenarios)<br>
<br>
45 + 20 + 30 = almost 2 hours<br>
<br>
therefore u will only be delaying the next guilds opportunity by what a whole 15-30 min LOL<br>
<br>
and the best thing about the cycle is you dont blow it ala Avatar of War.  When the other guild in question on the cycle is raiding say...plane of fire and dont intend to come try cursed that nite....i think a guild should be able to attempt cursed because its hurting no one.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Cursed will despawn after being up for 30 minutes, and you have to wait another 2 hours for the TM's to respawn, then start the whole cycle all over again. So while it doesn't blow the spawn, it does delay the guild up for cursed cleanup, a couple hours. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So add yuour time calculation PLUS two hours for the TM respawn.<br>

<br>
Killing of the TM's, by a non-rotation guild *when the triggers are up* will indeed set the Rotation Guild back by 2 hours.<br>
<br>
A guild that is trying to enter the G/E/C rotation has to kill both the G and E on that turn to be in the first part of the Rotation, the Glyphed/Exiled Rotation.  <br>
<br>
IF a guild fails on the Glyphed, the turn then passes to the next guild in the GLYPHED/EXILED Rotation.  This follows the same logic as any other Rotational mob.<br>
<br>
Successfully killing the Cursed on their g/e rotation turn, is the ONLY way a guild gets onto the Cursed Cleanup Rotation.<br>
<br>
When a guild can kill the G/E/C *on their turn*, the Cleanup never comes into play.  It's only when a guild fails on any part of the cycle, after successfully killing the Glyphed, that the Cleanup Rotation Guild comes in to kill whatever has not been killed.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/31/03 1:49:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1021.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Can you say...ASS?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, okay.
