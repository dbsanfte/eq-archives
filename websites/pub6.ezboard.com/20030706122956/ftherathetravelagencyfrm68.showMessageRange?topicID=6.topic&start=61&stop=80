Yes the rest of the world lives under just such a threat.  Throughout the world many countries have experienced acts of terrorism.  Unlike many countries, the U.S. has the means, the resolve and the commitment to do something about it.  That is what pisses off the rest of the world.  We can do something about it.<br>

I would love to help you there Mr. Jew in Germany but who am I to say it is wrong for Mr. Hitler to do what he wants. He has not hurt me personally in any way. I have strong convictions but I am not practicing them.<br>

<br>
Your being sarcastic here, saying that it is America that is in the wrong, and should not be going in and changing the government of anyone no matter how wrong. You know when we drove Germany out of france there was much opposition from the local populace, not much fighting but much boohooing about us doing it, because who are we? Same thing with Germany, but look at them now one of the most powerful economies in the world (Germany not france), they would not be where they are now without another country taking the responsibility of righting a wrong. Guess we shouldn't have done that since some of the hillbillies out in the mountains didn't know what freedom was and what they had lost when Hitler took over.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is we (the USA government and contrary to liberal belief, the general population in the USA) honestly believe we are doing the right thing, and not for oil, not for conquest, not for power but for humanity. If we wanted conquest we would have already taken Mexico, Canada, and most of not all of South America. A free Iraq has the potential to be a great and powerful nation. An Iraq under the fist and bootheel of the hussien family has no potential at all, other than the potential to try to invade another country for conquest again. If we do not find the WMD that we believe are there, then I guarantee you the USA will stand up before every nation and say we where wrong. <br>
<br>
I agree that there are many more nations out there worse than Iraq, but it has to start somewhere doesn't it? Sometimes you can't love your way to freedom, it has to be fought for even if you're not doing it. Cherishing human rights = to preserving human rights, not turning your eyes away from it when it gets dirty. Twist words all you want, but you are still sitting back in your chair criticizing people who are practicing what you only preach. Even Gandhi was more pro-active than you are I bet. When was the last time you and your higher sense of morals went to a foreign country to help bring water and food to the needy, or even took a homeless person in and gave him a job in your own town? I bet you haven't done either because it would infringe on your own personal luxuries, much like most of the world. I am not attacking you so don't take it as such, I am only trying to put things in perspective, at least the perspective that I use. I have given homeless jobs and a place to stay. I have gone to another country to unload food for the hungry and guard it so that it is not stolen and sold to the needy instead of given to them. I've seen fathers sell their daughters for food with my own eyes, it is the sort of thing that will stay with me for the rest of my life. I am not for war of any kind, but if doing this keeps that sort of thing from happening, then good. Who are you to say that it is your way and only your way is right? You guys keep rehashing the same rhetoric and doing what your preaching against, being obtuse and belligerent. &quot;Your wrong if you don't believe exactly what I believe.&quot; Take a little from side A and a little from side B and join the true majority on the outside on side C that can agree to disagree.<br>
<br>
The war is started, there is nothing you can do now but hope for the best. No, that is not falling in line, it is being a pragmatic. You can still disagree and voice your opinion that is what they are fighting for after all, but don't be so vain to think that it is going to change the outcome now that it has started. Wouldn't it be better to just hope that the lose of life that is going to happen is kept to a minimum? There are 50,000 troops doing what they can to help another country rise up out of the ashes that it's dictator put it in. Nobody else is at fault for what has happened but him. Bush Sr. did not give him the ok to move in to Kuwait, and Dubbya is not trying to finish anything that his dad didn't. He did something stupid and now his people are and have been paying the price. Why should you make those troops feel like monsters? Who are you to judge them? Because that is all your doing with every hate filled word that comes out of your collective mouths, I'm talking to both sides here. You ultra liberals and super right wing conservatives, undermine what they are doing every time you vomit forth more shit. (That was just my opinion and my way of doing my own protest.) Voice your opinion about the war, protest till you can not stand up, write your congressman, don't trash the people who are only doing their job.<br>
<br>
Also, just a point I would like to make here. If all of the world banded together and tried to invade the USA it would fail, so your example is not going to strike home with anyone. We have more well armed hillbillies than anyone and they are too stupid to be taken alive. Hell taking south L.A. would take an army by it self.<br>
<br>
P.S. G.W.BUSH did win the election as legal as any other president stop beating the dead horse. I didn't vote for him but I concede that he won. Grow up, it is over that is soooo Sept. 10th. If you aren't even an American what the fuck do you know about it? Just shut the fuck up and go back to your protest.<br>
<br>

I'm on the side that believes that actions speak louder than words.<br>

Words like that are written in U.N. resolutions calling for FULL and IMMEDIATE DISARMAMENT.<br>

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
1991 - U.N. Resolution 687 (excerpts)<br>
<br>
8. Decides that Iraq shall unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless, under international supervision, of: (a) All chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and all related subsystems and components and all research, development, support and manufacturing facilities; (b) All ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometres and related major parts, and repair and production facilities;<br>
<br>
9. Decides, for the implementation of paragraph 8 above, the following: <br>
<br>
(a) Iraq shall submit to the Secretary-General, within fifteen days of the adoption of the present resolution, a declaration of the locations, amounts and types of all items specified in paragraph 8 and agree to urgent, on-site inspection as specified below; <br>
<br>

<br>
Remember this.  Note the word unconditionally.<br>
<br>
Twelve years later.<br>
<br>
2002 - U.N. Resolution 1441<br>
<br>
1. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Decides that Iraq has been and remains in <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">material breach</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> of its obligations under relevant resolutions, including resolution 687 (1991), in particular through Iraq's failure to cooperate with United Nations inspectors and the IAEA, and to <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">complete the actions required under paragraphs 8 to 13 of resolution 687 (1991)</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
2. Decides, while acknowledging paragraph 1 above, to afford Iraq, by this resolution, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the Council</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->; and accordingly decides to set up an enhanced inspection regime with the aim of bringing to full and verified completion the disarmament process established by resolution 687 (1991) and subsequent resolutions of the Council;<br>
<br>
3. Decides that, in order to begin to comply with its disarmament obligations, in addition to submitting the required biannual declarations, the Government of Iraq shall provide to UNMOVIC, the IAEA, and the Council, not later than 30 days from the date of this resolution, a currently accurate, full, and complete declaration of all aspects of its programmes to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and other delivery systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles and dispersal systems designed for use on aircraft, including any holdings and precise locations of such weapons, components, sub-components, stocks of agents, and related material and equipment, the locations and work of its research, development and production facilities, as well as all other chemical, biological, and nuclear programmes, including any which it claims are for purposes not related to weapon production or material;<br>
<br>
4. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Decides that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and cooperate fully in the implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">further material breach</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> of Iraq's obligations</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and will be reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12 below;<br>
<br>
5. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Decides that Iraq shall provide UNMOVIC and the IAEA immediate, unimpeded, unconditional, and unrestricted access</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to any and all, including underground, areas, facilities, buildings, equipment, records, and means of transport which they wish to inspect, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>as well as immediate, unimpeded, unrestricted, and private access to all officials and other persons</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> whom UNMOVIC or the IAEA wish to interview...<br>

<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,76710,00.html" target="top">Hanx Blix Report to the U.N.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Highlights:<br>
<br>
Resolution 687 (1991), like the subsequent resolutions I shall refer to, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>required cooperation by Iraq but such was often withheld or given grudgingly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
As we know, the twin operation <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;declare and verify,&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> which was prescribed in resolution 687 (1991), too often turned into a game of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;hide and seek.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Rather than just verifying declarations and supporting evidence, the two inspecting organizations found themselves engaged in efforts to map the weapons programs and to search for evidence through inspections, interviews, seminars, inquiries with suppliers and intelligence organizations.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>While Iraq claims — with little evidence — that it destroyed all biological weapons unilaterally in 1991, it is certain that UNSCOM destroyed large biological weapons production facilities in 1996.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The large nuclear infrastructure was destroyed and the fissionable material was removed from Iraq by the IAEA.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>For nearly three years, Iraq refused to accept any inspections by UNMOVIC.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It was only after appeals by the Secretary-General and Arab states and pressure by the United States and other Member States, that Iraq declared on 16 September last year that it would again accept inspections without conditions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Resolution 1441 (2002) was adopted on 8 November last year and emphatically reaffirmed the demand on Iraq to cooperate. It required this cooperation to be <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">immediate, unconditional and active</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>When we have urged our Iraqi counterparts to present more evidence, we have all too often met the response that there are no more documents.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> All existing relevant documents have been presented, we are told. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>All documents relating to the biological weapons program were destroyed together with the weapons.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The recent inspection find in the private home of a scientist of a box of some 3,000 pages of documents, much of it relating to the laser enrichment of uranium support a concern that has long existed that documents might be distributed to the homes of private individuals.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>To date, 11 individuals were asked for interviews in Baghdad by us. The replies have invariably been that the individual will only speak at Iraq's monitoring directorate or, at any rate, in the presence of an Iraqi official.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This could be due to a wish on the part of the invited to have evidence that they have not said anything that the authorities did not wish them to say.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Want to know what side I'm on?<br>
<br>
I'm on the side who's word is their bond, especially when written down on paper as a resolution of the United Nations that was unanimous.<br>
<br>
I'm on the side of people that believe that a cease-fire has been violated, not once but over and over and over.<br>
<br>
I'm on the side of people that believe the U.N. is nothing but words and words don't mean shit when their words aren't obeyed.  Words like <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>inspection without conditions</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, words like <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>immediate, unconditional and active</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, words like <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>material breach</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and backed up with words like <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>further material breach</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
Jurrasic this is not a game.  This should not be looked upon like two kids shouting at each other in the schoolyard.  This is supposed to be the governing body of the entire world giving directives to it's members.<br>
<br>
So when some countries in the U.N. decided not to back up those words, the United States and the United Kingdom agreed that enough was enough.<br>
<br>
I agreed.  Enough is enough.<br>
<br>
Irregardless of any other reason I may present, this alone is enough to justify force since force is the only thing Saddam Hussein understands because he sure as hell don't care about words. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkfalz>Darkfalz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/2844/grongube.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/25/03 4:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/bilder/ill2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> &quot;If we wanted conquest we would have already taken Mexico, Canada, and most of not all of South America.&quot;<br>

<br>
No Ribbons, No Flags, No Fireworks: An Open Letter to Pro-War Americans<br>
By Tim Wise<br>
March 20, 2003<br>
<br>
Dear neighbor,<br>
<br>
&quot;Please spare me the lecture. Likewise, don’t bother asking me why I refuse to tie a yellow ribbon around the tree in my front yard, or put out a flag, or slather my Honda Civic with “Support the Troops” bumper stickers. I don’t feel like explaining it every time someone wants answers to these questions, and anyway, you probably wouldn’t like my reasons to begin with.<br>
<br>
You claim that we must now put aside our different opinions about the propriety of war with Iraq, and rally ‘round the President, the country, and our men and women in uniform. But you are wrong, and I imagine that at some level you know this to be true.<br>
<br>
After all, do we really have an obligation to support the troops no matter what they do as they prosecute this slaughter against a minor league opponent? Would you indeed support the troops if their mission involved nuclear incineration of Iraqi cities and villages? One, two, many My Lai massacres?  <br>
<br>
Beyond hypotheticals, should we support the troops even as they carry out the announced plan to launch nearly a thousand cruise missiles into Iraq’s major population centers within forty-eight hours of war? With the UN estimating that upwards of a half-million Iraqis might die as a result of this war, can you really say without any sense of misgiving that we should “support the troops” come what may, and that failure to do so should be branded un-American?<br>
<br>
Don’t misunderstand. I guess one could say that I too support the troops, but surely not in the way that you and other flag-wavers intend.&quot; (it continues)<br>
<br>
I support them being able to make a living and get an education without having first to subordinate their consciences to a military establishment that vitiates critical thought, reflection and free will, so as to create more efficient killing machines. How about you?<br>
<br>
There's more. Bottom line, don't be so arrogant to say those who don't support the war or Bush don't know what they are talking about and have no right to express their points of view. You therein have denied and negated the very spirit in which pro-war activists claim they are fighting for in Iraq and elsewhere. While many would like to see us return to a McCarthy'ism and Hoover era, I do not. I don't agree with many people on either side, and I read and form my own views. But I do not seek to deny or squelch the rights of others to form their opposing views. I wish to grow and not die in ignorance. How about you? But if calling names and hating those that don't agree with you makes it easier for you to believe what you believe is true, then maybe you should dig deeper and look in the mirror. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=patmcrotch>patmcrotch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Get it? <br>
