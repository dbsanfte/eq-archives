<br>
Now what i have been wondering is WTH is with all the United Necros jokes.  We had maybe 20 members when i was there and i was instructed to zerg invite peeps and only necros and it was a really fun guild for all of the 4 lvls i was in it.<br>

So can you all tell me the reason they get made fun of. <p>&lt;br&gt;Dastante Soulsaver &lt;br&gt;60 High Priest<br>

At the time Bots didn't have the best rep and not too many were upset at the results, although most knew the punishment didn't fit the crime, especially considering it wasn't even a member of Bots that did it.<br>

<br>
Especially Clerise post on SoT, I always thought SoT was one of the best guilds.  I remember asking Galudina when I was like lvl 45 or so, what level I could apply to join SoT.  As I had talked with Galudina a few times in EC, and she had helped me with buffs, and ressing some Iksar's that tried to make the run to Freeport at lvl 1 and got seen by slate.  Answer was you need to be lvl 58 but best to be lvl 60.  DoH!  I thought I would never hit 60.<br>
<br>
Anyways, my guild has evolved quite a bit as well, a long time ago we were High Lords of Battle.  I was never really in that guild, just joined with my Druid cause of lot of real life friends were there.  Figured if I was playing my druid I could help them out.  I am not really sure what really happened but sketchy information was that many of the members wanted to kill stuff, but the people they needed to show up for raids never really wanted to, and then the guild leader moved servers, and there was no guild leader.  (or noone with a leader tag)<br>
<br>
So me and a bunch of real life friends and family went to GD one day in hopes of starting a new guild under new leadership.  This is also the time when I had left Guardians of the Faith (I still haven't met Wulbyan!) as the Guide showed up ans said, oh you need the Leader and 10 other people to start the guild, and we had the Leader and 9 other people.  So my decision had to be made quickly.  Anyways the new guild was formed under Beltaine as the new leader as Shadowstar Ascendants.<br>
<br>
From then we all grouped leveled up in GD etc.  Trying to actually do raids, usually failed, but we tried the best we could, people were showing up though which was encouraging.  We had somehow gotten Fallen Shadows into our guild somewhere in the middle of all this as well.  Guess they were going to get disbanded cause not enough members remaining or something?  Anyways after some complications, Fallen Shadows broke off and remade their old guild.  This is when we pretty much fell apart, we were having issues with real life, and people kinda stopped wanting to do stuff.  Guild disbanded.<br>
<br>
Many of us stayed guildless for awhile, I joined VoF.  After about 6 months of being disbanded, we decided to make a new guild.  Altus Domini, lead by me and Jedc.  So far we are doing pretty good, we are rather small.<br>
<br>
Lately I been very discouraged as I want to get back to killing the stuff I did with VoF, but we just don't have the numbers to do, we have many many friends to our guild but we cannot invite them to raids to get on a rotation since they are in other guilds.<br>
<br>
We have put forth the effort to make alliances, but the same door being slammed in our face everytime about them having bad experiences before.  Doesn't mean you will this time, but I respect their decision.  Finding people to join is rather difficult as we don't have the reputation and guilds like Shadows of the Eclipse gives people a better opportunity to kill the bigger stuff, and we are just getting started.  Very frustrating right now, but I am sure things will work out eventually, most of us aren't going anywhere, I would say half our guild is real life friends.<br>
<br>
Anyways, just thought I would share the story of a smaller guild that is still pretty small, but we're trying to make our mark <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Did Temple of Veeshan - Halls of Testing last night for the first time with just 7 people with only 7 deaths in about 6 hours time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Extrafth Saliva<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> 61 Ikysaurus Monk<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=110448" target="top">Extrafth's Loots</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=137290">Ralkeem's Loots</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

We were one of the earlier guilds tagged when the game first went commercial and are still up and running (also in other games).  About a year and a half ago we created an alliance with The Nightmare Elite and Grave Wisdom (Undertakers Alliance).  TNE eventually folded and since then it has just been NOR and GW doing various raidings together.  As we are both more social guilds rather than raiding enitties, we aren't/weren't too widely known in EQ, but are steady with our memberships and content with our &quot;take time to smell the roses&quot; approach to the game (not to mention that we've been fortunate enough to have some damned fine players wear our alliance member tags who have gone on to important spots in larger guilds)<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260261">Barrd Talespinner</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
