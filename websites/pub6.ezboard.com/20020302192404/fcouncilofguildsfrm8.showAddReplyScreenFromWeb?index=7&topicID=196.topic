First Vox Raid.<br>
A Successful Vox Raid. Or was it?<br>
In Japan, this raid started at 10:00am Thursday morning, so I took the day off work and had a few stern words with my wife to attend.<br>
Aaerie Varieal (53 wiz) <br>
From the start, I was rearing to go. Knowing the upper limit on a Vox raid was 52, and having only 2 blue bubbles on my 53 level I took a quick trip up to Cobalt Star and died by wurm, bringing me just 3 blue bubbles down and into 52 again.  I also stocked up with food, water and spell reagents before porting into West Karana and making the run up to Permafrost to camp well before meeting time.<br>
Players started arriving 30 minutes before the scheduled start, but it was quite a while after that before we finally started to move.  At one stage we reported our class and level into Azure, and apparently organizing groups into balanced units with so many people was no easy thing (hat off to Azure). There were probably also the late signups to deal with, and on top of that there was the advanced support groups to get up and running before that main group moved.<br>
Support Teams.<br>
It was explained to me that there were advanced support troops. It was their<br>
job to run down first and clear the Ice Giants. From my understanding, this was <br>
to preserve the integrity of the main stick force for the dragon. We were <br>
instructed to move down and through the halls ignoring the ice goblins as we went and to meet and BIND at a stone outside what was described to me as The Kings Room. <br>
Advice for first timers in this: Stick close to your group leader. It’s not hard to get lost and turned around in the winding ice tunnels that lead to this first camp. It happened to me and I had to be rescued by tanks behind me when I was set upon buy a train of 4 particularly stupid but potentially dangerous goblins. I don’t have to remind you wizards out there that casting is impossible when interrupted.<br>
Once outside the big doors of the Kings room Azure perched herself on the rock, instructing casters to bind while, I assume, fielding /tells from the advanced group on what must have been an ongoing battle. For me, it was more waiting. I, like most of the others, milled around staying in close formation and trying not attract unwanted agro from anything that might have been nearby. Again, more waiting.<br>
Our group leader, a tank and veteran of 3 Vox raids then tells us he is leaving.  He went on about how things were not being done right and having been warned by Azure that another unauthorized /Tell would warrant his removal from the raid.<br>
Oh.<br>
Myself and another caster in my group (Myre) pleaded with him to stick it out and stay. Unfortunately to no avail. I have no idea what was going on behind those big doors, but we could all hear the blasts of magic and roars from the Ice Giants. Azure remained motionless and silent throughout, obviously very busy somewhere else. At this stage, we were getting very nervous. Our group leader had ported out, and things were getting tense. Finally however Azure came back to life and we all moved beyond the doors and into the next room. Presumably the king’s room. There was a very large closet in the room. Does the king live in a closet?<br>
There, we started waiting again. This is when I started to get very curious. the main group huddled in the center, some sitting by the walls waiting. I mention to DABOOM that I was seriously thinking of going in to have a peek at what was going on. He said np, he would get a cleric ready for a rez. I took his point and sat back down<br>
I started noticing that the exits from the room were being guarded. It might have been that there were just many people in the room, or a product of over imagination.<br>
But I saw pets patrolling the halls leading in and out of the room. I also noticed a couple of tanks standing to one side of each entrance, and wondered to myself if they had been ordered to stand guard there, but I saw nothing come down those halls. Did we have support staff further down keeping them clear? I don’t know, but I wouldn’t be surprised. Such was the organization. I couldn’t figure out what our group leader had been talking about.<br>
More waiting, more blasts of magic and the sound of furious battle from beyond our position.<br>
A couple more ported out. There were green /ooc messages floating around, some in banter but most in argument. Things were apparently not going smoothly somewhere. <br>
An occasional Ice Giant made its way into our position only to be mauled buy our group, glad to vent the pent up tension that had been built up for some time. This is when I discovered that the spells of choice I had memed;<br>
 Drought Of Fire (3.0 casting and 690 odd damage) Rend ( 5.0 casting 855 odd damage) and Enticement of Flame (6.0 casting 360 odd damage but low resistance) were ALL BEING RESISTED.<br>
This caused me no end of concern, and I communicated as such to DABOOM, the very helpful enchanter in our group. DABOOM was a late addition to our group taking the place of the leader that had ported out. And a VERY welcome addition I might add. To my knowledge the raid only had one other enchanter, and she was VERY busy. DABOOM cast a BRILLIANCE buff on me, and I was able<br>
to land EVERY spell on the next Ice Giant than managed to get through to us making me very happy indeed.  THX DABOOM!!!!! (on my list of free TL’s for life!)<br>
More waiting.<br>
The other player that sticks in my mind was EPHRON. I had him set up as main assist on my hotkey, and he seemed to be Azure’s First Officer. <br>
Commander Ephron if you will.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Apparently a veteran of many a Vox raid, he was cool, calm, and inspiration to us all.<br>
Solid as a rock, and not one to loose his cool in a tense situation.<br>
That’s the best description I can come up with.<br>
As the Guild leader in Haven of Light once mentioned to me,<br>
“People may not remember what you do. And they may not remember what you say. But they WILL remember how you make them feel.”<br>
This is ever so true. And I will always remember and respect Ephron for that.<br>
I got that “I will follow you into hell and back you to the last” feeling for him.<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Competence-  is a word that quickly comes to mind.<br>
<br>
During an especially tense moment while the /ooc’s were hinting of disaster,<br>
Ephron broke his apparently self imposed rule of &lt;No Complaining In Raid&gt;<br>
and said something like this. (he must have been on the front line, and in the thick of it.)<br>
“We will all live or all die depending on a tank’s willingness and ability to disengage<br>
effectively and go back to clerics for a heal. I’ve seen many a moron who valiantly stayed in the fight and died, only to get the others killed because he was not there to keep Vox engaged from casting and healing herself.”<br>
One of two things will happen:<br>
1)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tanks will rotate through and keep stunning and healing, keeping her from casting and healing giving the casters a chance to nuke. <br>
or<br>
2)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We will all die.<br>
<br>
The key he said, is a tank bashing and paladin chain stunning to keep her from casting, then at 50% health stepping back and getting off agro before running to clerics for a heal before re-engaging and doing it all over again.<br>
Apparently, many were taking that to heart, because that’s what I saw later on.<br>
After we got the word from Azure, she then called us into line and led us into an organized buffing line, and ordered us to immediately camp after buff and log into a chat room to preserve buffs and discuss tactics.<br>
I must say this worked very effectively. There was great communication by those buffing to players as they moved down the line (essential to those of us in our first raid), and everything was made clear and easy. At the end of the line before camping I had every space in my buff box full.<br>
Chat was well organized and quick. Azure obviously had a list of things to go over and she went through religiously, and had a staff of good officers to back her. No sooner had she gone through the tactics step by step than we were all logging back in.<br>
This rush was also precipitated by the news that the servers were coming down for a patch in less than two hours. This to some might seem like a long while, but we had already been in game on this raid for 5 hours and had yet to see the dragon. Time required for recovery after a failed attempt was obviously going through people’s minds.<br>
When I logged back in Azure had officers sitting on the 3 ramps guarding them in case anyone went up the wrong one.<br>
Ephron made it clear that only the ramp he was on was to be used.<br>
Tanks were ordered to the front. I stayed to the rear against the wall watching all of this with the other casters. (there weren’t many of us)<br>
Then something went wrong.<br>
I don’t know where or how. But no sooner did the first wave of troops go up around the corner at the top of the ramp than there were /shouts going back and forth between officers and troops;  PULL BACK!! PULL BACK NOW!!<br>
I could see on my chat bar that something was casting at us<br>
‘You lose your control’ (fear spell?)<br>
but I was still able to move without a problem, I’m not sure if that was because<br>
of the buffs or not. Then there were more shouts and people were disappearing up the ramp again. We casters followed and stopped short of the stone that moved to the side, people running through it one after another. Blasts of magic and roars came from within so it wasn’t hard to guess what was going on inside.  /ooc’s and /shout’s kept flying, and then all of a sudden there was shout “NUKE! NUKE! NUKE!”<br>
I raced in and saw Vox, off the platform and half way to the door flailing around her at the surrounding tanks that were furiously engaged with her.  I raced straight under her as ordered and cut lose, chain hitting with only Drought Of Fire because of its quick casting time.<br>
The buffs must have been working because I landed one after another, and was feeling quite good about the way things were going having expended 75% of my mana in short order without a scratch while Vox’s health bar was already below 20%. My manna was down to 15% when she started hit me. (for only 100?)<br>
I got down to 5% mana before I died, but felt at the time that the timing of that just couldn’t have been better. I reappeared at bind spot just below the ramp and quickly remember Drought Of Fire before racing back up the ramp and through the door ready to get back under her and cut lose again.<br>
But when I rushed in the first thing I see is a large group surrounding a dead Vox.   My first reaction was being disappointed in not getting another blast at her for killing me. But then I realized how many of the players were still standing. There were a lot. And the entire battle couldn’t have taken more than 4 minutes. It was on for young and old, and then quite suddenly it was over.<br>
Both me and the other wizard under her had gone down, but then this was expected. Standing under a dragon while chain nuking with blasts of fire for 690 points of damage a hit is bound to be risky.<br>
There were congratulations going all round, with sighs of relief and a not a little surprise that it had gone so fast and so well.<br>
Some like me were sitting by their corpse waiting for a rez that came almost as soon as we had. Others were looking around the lair, seemingly searching for something else to kill. It was all relief and laughter, /massage and /dance<br>
And then the mood changed. ooc’s started to fly on the question of loot.<br>
Some wanted to know who had collected it. Others wanted to know what had dropped. Who could roll on what?<br>
Thankfully Azure had things prepared well in advance and had obviously expected that. She had apparently assigned people to loot and hold until things could be worked out. Loot masters transferred the looted items to Azure, and before long she was standing on the platform announcing what had been dropped.<br>
There was confusion however, and not a little grumbling about those permitted to roll and not roll on certain items. It seemed to me as if before the role had even started the 2 epic book had already been awarded.<br>
How that happened I have no idea and it seemed other didn’t know either. Did I miss it or were they pre-awarded? There were grumbles.<br>
I however relaxed and was enjoying that winning feeling because the one thing I was after was the Eye Patch. And 2 of them had dropped. I was pretty sure that they would be restricted to casters, and there wasn’t that many of us standing under the dragon.<br>
Or so I though.<br>
It turned out there were more of us casters because the support teams were also awarded rolls on the dragon loot. This greatly increased the number of people awarded a roll on the Eye Patches, and I ended up with nothing.<br>
I was disappointed. I’m sure others were also. <br>
There was confusion over 1 item because people had rolled on it before the role had been called by Azure, and those people that had won the first one were required to roll again, and lost the second time around. I distinctly remember one player emoting “RAGE” again and again. The atmosphere dropped quite a few degrees, and I was sitting and quietly meming TL and TP spells.<br>
After 6 and a half hours, almost all of it waiting in one place or another I had come out with no material. Not a single gem, not a single experience point, nothing. In fact I had voluntarily lost experience points to qualify for the raid group and taken a day off work to do it. This will be on my mind the next time I see a Dragon Raid scheduled.<br>
For me, it was 4:30 in the afternoon but I knew it was much later for others so I stepped back onto the empty platform and called out for people that needed TL’s and TP’s. Being a Wizard with TP spells I wanted to be the last one out after porting the rest, but I only managed a few before I had to port myself and camp quickly because I had to pick up my car from the repair shop before 5pm.<br>
In retrospect, I should have stayed at 53 and run in with the support team. At least that way I would have been more involved in groups cutting down the Ice Giants, therefore gaining in exp points and also taking part in the Ice Giant loot whatever it might have been, as well as getting a roll in the dragon loot.<br>
Not getting anything in the dragon loot then wouldn’t really bother me. After all, the exp from the Ice Giants at the very least isn’t nothing.<br>
This leads me back to a question I had just before all of this started up in Permafrost during group ups.<br>
Why are there so few Wizards in this raid?<br>
<br>
<br>
As a final word I will add this. There is no doubt in my mind after seeing and experiencing this that the organization, pre-planning and in-game communication between Azure and her officers made this raid a successful one. Because when all is said and done, you only had to count the number of peeps around the dragon corpse to see that it had gone off without a major problem. When it came to the crunch, almost everyone knew where they had to go and what they had to do. Congratulations to Azure and her very capable officers. Lady Vox is Dead.<br>

First of all this is a great post of someone who first joins a CoG raid and has no idea what is going on. <br>
<br>
First I was the Support team, I ran the group of high levels to clear all the Giants until we got to the lair pulls. We had a warrior, a Paladin, a rogue (me), a cleric and a mage. We cleared 2 spiders, 2 icy terrors and 15 ice giants (not counting the 30 minute spawns maybe add another 8 there)<br>
<br>
Then we had to pull the Lair. Us high levels can’t pull because everytime Lady Vox’s sees us she Banishes us (Sends out to the zone into Permforst in Everfrost) and we have to run back in. We first tried our Enchanter we had (level 45) with some bad luck she fall into a pit. That was bad she was the only enchanter at the time and yes it took me almost an hour to get her out. Sorry next time you can try it with out an enchanter. When we did get her out I had a Cleric, mage and me as the support time. The Paladin had to leave and the Warrior changed to his Druid who was a healer in one of the groups. <br>
<br>
So then I Asked Azure to bring you all into the main room because I needed you to help kill the giants. It was never planned for you to fight them it was planned to have them cleared by the time you got there. Sorry we goofed. Ephron was assigned to me to help pull the lair spawns. Man the times that boy died for you guys isn’t funny, the amount of times the poor mage died who was in the support time was pretty sad to. &lt;Smile&gt; (Oh that was the pet you saw. The support team was in the room with you) After a number of tries (and Deaths) Ephron was able to pull half the stuff in the lair. That is what Cleric called /ooc giants inc I would have done it but I got Banished. I don’t care what you think. We all every single person did great. Not one death (well besides Ephron and the mage.) I’m sorry I didn’t get time to explain how to fight giants. It wasn’t the buff that made you land your spells it was range. You need to be in Melee Range to have spells land with Giants. The same reason you need to stand under Vox to hit her. It’s a high level monster thing. After that Ephron want in again and pulled the remaining Giants and Icy Terrors (Again great job bro) that had cleared the lair. The people that where in the support staff where in as much danger as you and had as much to loss or gain as everyone there. Everyone got rezed quickly by the Cleric, all the corpses got pulled from the Pits by me. In fact the support team had to clear the giants 2 times. All of them. We had an necromancer come and join us later and to buff you for the raid. And he also would have helped get the corpses out of the lair if you all had failed. You don’t know how luck you are to have a high level Cleric, necro and rogue there to help. You talk about staying alive as long as you did because of the buffs? You had level 57 and level 54 cleric buff on you. Giving you a lot of hit points and Armor class. Again for the support team and those Buffs don’t come for free. <br>
<br>
It takes everyone to win against Vox, when she died it was very very close there was only 2 tanks standing. Every nuke, every heal, bash stun, resist song, etc.. played a part in her dying. Those are things that support staff can’t do and I wish I could help in more then I do. Maybe that one backstab could be a matter of lossing or winning the fight?  <br>
<br>
As for loot and Exp. I’m sorry to report that’s not why people join the Dragon raids. It’s to do something you can’t do on your own. To be part of something bigger and larger then yourself. To do something that only a small number can and will do. You get the chance to kick a big bad dragon in the tail pipe and dance over her corpse. You go for the Kill, loot and exp is but a bonus. <br>
<br>
There is more to the Support team then just killing some giants and then rolling on loot. It’s filled with stress and knowing 50+ people’s lives or corpses are in your hands. And that Stress is only a small Fraction of what the Raid leader feels. And trust me I know.<br>
