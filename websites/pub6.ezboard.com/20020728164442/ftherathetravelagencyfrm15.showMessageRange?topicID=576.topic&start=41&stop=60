<br>
But is there any reason someone may have said &quot;grats Seht&quot;  like he dinged, or got some other small piece of loot?  This might clarify the initial confusion.<br>
<br>
I do not doubt that Seht looted your boots, but now I want to know if it was a mistake.<br>
<br>
I will hold true to my words.  I will MQ the plate boots with you feriin.  However, I will need some time due to the fact that we know how rare they are.  If you want help in Kael getting them or if you want me to actually loot them on one of our raids is entirely up to you.  Also Erlas has not worked on faction enough to turn stuff in.  My wizard Ravienn still needs a little more faction as well.<br>
<br>
Contact me and we will finish this.  I consider it done, but just want to clarify a few things for my piece of mind.  I want to make sure i'm thourogh so that this can be prevented in the future.<br>
<br>
I appologize for this whole mess.<br>

Let me start by saying their is extremely bad blood between myself and Dragon Dynasty because of some politics involved between me and them which I will not get into here since it is over, but let's just say we have agreed to disagree and they are no ally to me and vice versa.  In other words, since I and they do not like each other much, I have no reason to stick up for them other than the truth in this matter.<br>
<br>
With that being said here is the truth as I witnessed. I was in the DFL at the time this incident happened and Seht DID NOT win the roll.  Feriin did in FACT win the roll.  When Seht looted, the group chat lit up ( I was grouped with him and pulling for this raid ).  I explained to him that he did NOT win the roll and he AGREED to Multiquest the boots for Feriin.  I also sent Ferrin a tell and she confirmed she was in private chat with Seht about the issue and he had told her the same thing.  Seht was very clear about the fact that he would do this for her and said he was sorry for looting and &quot;thought&quot; he had won.  Anyway this is the same Seht that sat tell bombing me in Velks every 2 minutes asking me if a Sword of Pain drops can he loot it when I had a group down there attempting to get myself one a few months ago...pretty annoying it went on for at least 5 hours.<br>

Hutterr, I think that is one of the first positive things I have ever seen printed about my guild on this board.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
I normally don't get in Ravienn's way defending anyone unless he sticks his foot in his mouth.  He hasn't this time (well, not past the toes at least) but I want to chime in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Addressing the issue:</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
From what I've read, there is apparently 99.999% of the argument that Seht was wrong, and 00.001% saying that Seht was right.  I have no doubt that there was some sort of oversight on Seht's part, beit not watching who rolled what, being too far away to see other rolls, having someone erroneously say &quot;congrats Seht&quot;... or whatever the hell happened.  I wasn't there; I don't know.  But I have no doubt that Feriin is right and Seht is wrong.  Neither does Ravienn nor any other officer in BoW.<br>
<br>
We need the information that Ravienn requested.  Not so much to say who is right and wrong in this matter, because that is becoming painfully obvious, but subsequently, how to appropriatly deal with Seht.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Rectifying the issue:</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Ravienn and I take some folks down to the plate house and get you a set of boots.  Ravienn doesn't currently have the faction to help with the turn-in, so I will MQ them with Feriin if he doesn't have the faction by then, cuz I live in Thurgy anyways.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Preventing future issues:</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
I'm not going to talk again in supreme detail about how BoW got started and give the entire history of the guild for the sake of brevity in this post.  I'll try to say everything I want to in a relatively concise manner.<br>
<br>
The founding folks (5 of us, myself included) are all Army guys situated on Okinawa.  4 of us are still here.  The founders are all former members of LoL, and we started this guild using the same principles that they do.  BoW started with less than 20 members and everything was great.  We grew some, promoted a few others as officers, and they sent this guild death-spiraling into total @#%$ chaos (very long story made short there).  You've all seen and read wonderfully written flames about some people who used to be members of this guild.  In fact, until this post, no member of BoW has completely survived a substantiated flame from this forum.  <br>
<br>
On May 28th, BoW leaders reshaped the focus, structure, and policies of the entire guild.  In a &quot;cut the @#%$&quot; effort, we have downsized the guild's officers back to the original founding 5.  We've completely stopped recruiting, and have placed every single member of the guild on a 30-day, zero-tolerance, no bullshit probation period, officers included.  This effort has been well-received by the guild, and attitudes have changed.  People have started looking at situations differently.  In short, the warning shot was fired and people are responding.<br>
<br>
Can I guarantee that the occasional jackass won't rear his/her head and put another blasting cap on the head of BoW?  No, but I wish I could.  I can only say that BoW is making an active effort to get rid of bullshit like this so that we can move forward and grow as a guild.  99.9% of the guild's current members are great people, and they're mature enough to know what *not* to do.<br>
<br>
Ravienn sticks his neck out and ducks the axe more than he has to, but he and I share the same goals with this guild, and we both know that letting issues like this just go unanswered isn't exactly good. <p><a href="http://www.geocitites.com/bowrathe"><img src="http://www.mygem.net/bloodofwar/imagesP/tahmayww.jpg" height=181 width=300><br>

I said, if you already had them then you must have the corroded still so you can MQ them for Feriin.

I, if I were involved, which im not, would have only one problem.<br>
<br>
Why are YOU multiquesting it?<br>
<br>
To be quite honest, Rav....you're treating this situation as if YOU made the mistake, and you didnt. To me...it seems thats not fair to you, and what does it teach Seht?<br>
<br>
Also, it seems that Seht has the attitude that the situation is dealt with, simply and ONLY because HE doesnt care. And that any resolution will come by his guild leaders hands (you) and not by himself.<br>
<br>
Its admirable that you're in tune with your guild tag enough that any pain to it is a stab to you....im the same way...but be damned if *I* ever do the grunt work for another guild members mistake.<br>
<br>
Take this into account, its apparently been established that its not your army buddy who ninjaed, but rather his brother, and im willing to bet that any of the testimony in the above threads was said by the brother as well. You might want to start by telling your army buddy that his brother needs his own character, because the &quot;my brother did it, not me&quot; excuse is so verrrry unnacceptable anymore. <p><a href=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Database/scripts/character-page.php?charid=5>Kluz</a><br><embed src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Flash/kluzsig.swf" quality=high pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="200" height="150"></embed><br><a href=http://www.fallenshadows.cjb.net>Fallen Shadows</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usummersnow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Summersnow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/7/02 1:58:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=576.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I hate to admit this...</span><hr size=1> I finally found the right log file on the right computer.<br>

[Tue Apr 16 20:42:49 2002] Feriin tells you, 'he said yes '<br>
<br>
At NO time did anyone congratulate Seht, in fact numerous people corrected him when he said he won.<br>
<br>
Plain and simple, weather Seht made an honest mistake or blatenly ninja looted an item he knew wasn't his only he can answer.  What is clear is that he KNEW he screwed up at the time and agreed to correct his mistake and then flat out DIDN'T.<br>

And yes he was wrong in not following through with his promise.<br>
<br>
Thank you for posting the log, it helps.<br>
<br>
And Kluz, you can blame the military for the officers feeling they need to take this upon themselves, its common practice that the supervisor/leader of a soldier is at fault.  Call it habit if you will and the price of rank/leadership.  Three of the founding five of our guild are non-commissioned officers in the Army, and we are used to this sort of thing.<br>
<br>
However, I've mentioned in an email to Feriin that I want to change what I posted here to the effect that Seht will most likely loot the boots and MQ them or the person of Feriin's choice.<br>
