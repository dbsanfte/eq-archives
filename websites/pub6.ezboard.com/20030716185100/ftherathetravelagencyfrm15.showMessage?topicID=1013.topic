<br>
ha, this coming from someone who tries to cyber each and every female character within a 40 mile radius of yourself. more on this later.<br>
<br>
you know people say some pretty stupid shit, but you just cease to fucking amaze me. what in the living hell do you THINK gives you the right to walk up to someone, call then a whore and slut.. and then talk about their PERSONAL PRIVATE business that has nothing to do with YOU, or your guild.. in public say. like you are some divine power that has authority over all living beings.<br>
<br>
you never have anything good to say, you never say anything worth reading at all. usually your posts consist of nothing but a one sentence bash on whoever posted, or whatever topic they posted about. you contribute absolutely fucking nothing to the RTA yet you post mass amounts of inane bullshit left and right. you're like a little fucking toddler who has to go around punching other kids in the eye and making them cry so you can feel all-powerful and wise. <br>
<br>
and about that slut and whore comment you made in public say, who are you to talk about who ebays what? and what does it matter anymore these days? christ half the characters on the rathe or ANY server for that matter are ebayed in one way or another these days, oh ya, i forgot.. that includes you you fucking dumbass. go on and deny it. better yet, go run to your guild and get them to come post on here and attempt to prove me wrong like you did before. it won't work, you can hide behind the truth for as long as you like but the fact remains that you're a fake piece of shit. go on try and prove me wrong.<br>
<br>
(note: not busting on the guild, i like most of the members)<br>
<br>
i know i can't prove any of this, but oh well.. not like you can prove any of this is wrong. fact remains that alot of people i talk to are sick of your rude lewd comments to them, and you're covering it all up with this &quot;i hate cyber&quot; gig.<br>
<br>
you say shit you mean for tells in public say or something and then try and cover it up with this &quot;oh we're friends, just messing around&quot; crap. it's so pathetic.. it's embarassing and you know it.<br>
<br>
&quot;uh hyuck i'm gonna bust on people that cyber&quot; give me a fucking BREAK! this coming from someone who constantly sends tells to female characters saying nasty shit, talking about your masturbation habits and what not.. again try and deny it, really i can't prove anything about this and well, you can't prove i'm wrong. but yeah i've seen the conversations and i also know about your little Yahoo webcam chat that ended up with you trying to spank it in front of said person. btw she says your hung like a cocktail shrimp in ice =X<br>
<br>
i grouped with you once in PoD and you seemed like a nice enough person but i've seen the way you act towards people in tells and etc, and i must say that you must be one of the most pathetic little pricks i have yet encountered in EQ, hell let me check my &quot;pathetic fucking pricks i've encountered&quot; list and get back with you on whether or not your're the biggest one i've EVER met.<br>
<br>
to cut a long story short Kluz, stfu already and stop being such a low-life perverted sick nasty freak, stop being so negative about EVERYTHING, and i'd like to say stop being an ignorant bastard but yeah that's kind of hard to change, so oh well i guess you're gonna be a loser the rest of your life. AND GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE. no you aren't the dopest motherfucker this side of Compton, nobody wants to hear your nasty cyber bullshit, nobody cares who ebayed what.. really, i couldn't care less that you ebayed Kluz, i'm only stating that to show that you have no fucking right to talk to people the way you did in nexus. and last but not least i'm not even going to bother coming back to read the replys to this post, because i could care less.<br>
<br>
attempt to disclaim my information all you like, you know it's true. whether or not you want to hide behind the facade some more is your call. i said what i wanted to say and i'm through. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=klurak1234>Klurak 1234</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/27/03 5:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1013.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kluz, your turn.</span><hr size=1> nice flame! gonna sick back and watch, this is gonna be interesting...  i give this an '8' !<br>

But what do you care.  If she logged off eq and willingly viewed his web cam, This dosnt make that girl very upstanding.  she stayed and watched, if it offended her she could have closed it out.  He obviously was not forcing her to stay.  No one can.  I don't know what system they use to see/view the cam but on yahoo you have to ask permission/accept to watch it.  <br>
<br>
What someone does in their personal llife.. who cares?  If someone wants to be chained up and beaten thats their personal life.  How can you knock on someone elses.  <br>

You brought this up for dick size?  HA..men are so amusing.  Go ahead and flame for game things.. but outside the game.. To each their own as long as its legal.  Yeah I will get flamed but who is anyone to judge anyone else in RL.  <br>

Zack might not come back under his nam, But he will probably live theough Jhester with this.

she closed out the yahoo webcam chat immediately. it's not like she sat there looking at it like she wanted to evenly remotely think of such horrors.<br>

She was apparently close enough in game to Kluz to at least view his face on the webcam.  Kluz would not be so bold enough as to flop it out without some form of coersion.  So whoever this said person is, is not so lilly white pure.  And who's to say this really even happened cause Kluz has a GF in RL, he doesnt need a girlfriend made of pixels.  And I know Kluz to be true and not a cheater.<br>
<br>
I really don't even know where this flame is stemming from, it was full of stfu's and accusations. was there any true point?  I know there alot of people who don't agree/get along with Kluz, but he has remained one of my oldest friends on the Rathe.

I rate this flame below a 2.  Only because flame  him on a game message board about his actions in game.. and how he is as a player.  Not his RL.. you dont know him.. No one has a right to judge him as a person.  <br>

<br>
The Kluz-Kam only goes on for men over the age of 50. And no one else. I'm sorry ladies. <br>
<br>
Second, Zaketh, has it been like....2 years since we've talked to you?<br>
<br>
I think when he's talking about calling someone a whore and slut in say, he was talking about Silienii, who I saw last night, and, as a joke in ooc said &quot;Silienii's a whore! ; )&quot; notice the smiley face after it. Then I went up to her in the Nexus, and said &quot;Hey slut. How ya been?&quot; and was talking to her, forgetting I was in ooc. Long story short, its no secret Sil and I are friends, and if I want to call her a slut, which I've been doing for about 3 years now, I will.<br>
<br>
Zaketh, butt the fuck out. Flame Central may be dying for a flame, and you may have some &quot;dirt&quot; on me or whatever, but none of this shit really concerns you, and none of it makes me a bad person. YOu saw me talking to Silienii as we have been for years, and decided to exploit it. That makes you lame.<br>
<br>
Youre simply a bitter fucking asshole who used to troll the Fallen Shadows Forums, posted something about how child abuse is the funniest fucking thing ever, we disagreed, you got banned, and now here you are drumming up bullshit.<br>
<br>
Frankly, in the long run, I really don't care what you think of me, or what anyone does. I care about doing the right thing, and making the game fun for people. I'm a friendly guy. And unless I make a direct attack on you, keep my name out of the FC topics.<br>

I live with Kluz, and what he says about only spanking it in front of men over 50 is true.
