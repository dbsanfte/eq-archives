Maybe in other guilds, but just think, I being a member of SoT, have good friends and long conversations with many BoTs, TL, NB and many others. Even during the most heated of arguements, I stood up for what I thought was right. I did get alittle flack from some guildies later on in the raid... when asked who invited Saas.<br>
<br>
I know many in many guilds who are the same way as I.<br>
<br>
I also seen people from guildes openly protest what they think their guild did was wrong. I have seen people /GR from various guilds for things they thought wrong or unjust.<br>
<br>
I have faith in people, and at times I am proved wrong, but I am happy when I am proved right. <p><p align="center"><map name="FPMap0">

<br>
In SoT as well as the other big guilds.  I have raided with all of you at one time or another.  It is normally the vocal minority that speaks out not the silent majority.  I have good friends in big guilds and the little ones but I also have people that hate me in each I'm sure.  What is said in tells amongst friends and what is said in /gu can be deceiving especially when the silent majority does not speak.<br>
<br>
I hope when you say, &quot;Maybe in other guilds...&quot;, you aren't implying that SoT members as a guild stand by their friends guilded or not.  Don't get me wrong some may and those are &quot;true&quot; friends.  But if you believe that every SoT member has the same virtues you describe then you are quite naive my friend.<br>
<br>
I, myself, have stopped attending raids with some guilds do to objections of a few members.  It is funny how you get tells from someone that guildie xyz doesn't like you and doesn't want you to attend.  Then you get another tell from guildie abc saying they are glad to see you raiding with them and encourage you to join.<br>
<br>
I still remember when life was more simple for me...  you, me, some really good ranger whose name evades me and Bathizarre (aka Tubbie) grouping in KC at zone in or LCY.<br>
<br>

I retract my words of &quot;Maybe in other guilds&quot;<br>
<br>
I will not act dumb that most people have opinions within my guild, but do not voice them.<br>
<br>
I try to encourage everyone to say their peace, and hold no grudges against them.<br>
<br>
I only hold grudges to those that personally wrong me.<br>
<br>
And I do agree, we all wish for the easier days. When things were so much easier. Kinda like an EQ &quot;Lose of Innocence&quot;.<br>

Sometimes I go wander North Ro and watch the group there, and think back to the days I was there. <p><p align="center"><map name="FPMap0">

<br>
The days when I thought &quot;OOM&quot; was someone roleplaying meditation......<br>
<br>
When a lockjaw tunic was easily the best piece of equipment in existance....<br>
<br>
When I saw a level 30 druid flying in the air running as fast as a train and thought &quot;someday I will be able to do that&quot;.....<br>
<br>
When I logged on and waited fully 3 hours to do anything at all, so that I would be ready when those three special people logged in, and we could begin our adventures....<br>
<br>
When a guild was not about Uber mobs, or phat lewts, or politics. But, merely a way for everyone to talk to each other at the same time .....<br>
<br>
When level 50 was &quot;end game&quot;.....<br>
<br>
When Efreeti was THE camp to get, and GEBs  were right below god loot.....<br>
<br>
Those days are gone now, we have grown and moved on. Yet we have lost nothing, we traded the simplicities in for maximum excitement, and adventure. We traded our giant chat room in for something that we could stand by and be loyal to, and that would be far more rewarding in the end, than seeing what Johnny did last friday when he was drunk.<br>
<br>
We can always remember the old days my friends, but we must never lose sight of the present, or the future.<br>
<br>
As human beings, we posess within us an innate longing to become stronger and better, with new strength comes responsibility, and along the road we find hardship, sometimes even lonliness.<br>
<br>
One post cannot hold all the highs and lows one has during their everquest life, but always remember the happy times you have.<br>
<br>
Remember when your friend finished their epic quest? How you helped them, and how happy they were? =)<br>
<br>
Remember when you killed your first God? =)<br>
<br>
Remember when you lost to some monster three maybe four times, it was so late you couldn't keep your eyes open, but you stayed for one last try. You won, finally, heh and now you couldn't sleep because you were so excited at having won. =)<br>
<br>
Remember when that piece of loot dropped, and you thought &quot;Wow that is so awesome, I wonder who will get it?&quot;, next thing you know....they call your name? =)<br>
<br>
These are joys that come only when you trade in the simplistic ways of your youth, and pass into what can be called &quot;EQ Adulthood&quot;<br>
<br>
So, in short. Always remember the past, for it holds grand memories, but never forget the here and now,   for in the end what you do now, will determine your level of &quot;entertainment&quot; (to put it lightly) in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>

Myself, I hold friendships foremost and history takes second place.  Unfortunately, some people consider guilds and &quot;fitting in&quot; more important in game rather than the reality of life as true friends are hard to come by.  I would be lucky to die with one 5 &quot;true&quot; friends in RL.<br>

Beds. Old days. Novel thoughts, but what it boils down to is, i still know the same people, still have the same friends, will still go on raids. And you know why this is?<br>
Because the people that DO know me, know me better than to believe a lie, even if i hadnt already PROVED it to be a lie.<br>
<br>
Boo hoo, ill never be &quot;invited&quot; to a raid you are on. That only leaves thousands of other raids, oh no, what will i ever do? And why would i want to hang around you anway? You are a lier. What does being a lier mean, you ask? That means if you will lie about one thing, you are capable of lieing about anything, which says i am not the 1st or the last person you will lie to. <br>
<br>
I made my bed. Thats right. I have made my bed, and thats why i have the friends i do. You know... its funny, its funny<br>
that i have done 1 thousand good things, but having made a mistake that is how ill be remembered by you, not that it makes that much of a difference to me anyway, just stop asking me for ports, help on raids, with cr's/rezes, loans, and spells (torpor, bane of nife etc..) I have met, talked to on the phone, and played EQ with some awesome people, been to some server 1sts, i am only missing 2 keys, i have one of a kind gear, and i have passed the 1000ac/attk  mark with self gear and buffs, have 255+ wis, 130+ to all svs, all thanks to the people i call friends... but wait theres more... <br>
the people i know GAVE me a Jade Reaver, and those are the people i will care about and what they think, NOT someone who is willing to tell or believe lies. i am not trying to brag, im just trying to say, that not many people would be able to achieve this being the kind of person you label me as!<br>
<br>
It is easy to @#%$ with somebodys reputation, a couple well placed/timed tells, oocs, shouts, and posts could do the trick, and apparently it doesnt even have to be true. Maybe its time i started firing back? Maybe?  <br>

Then good, I am glad I will never have to go through getting about 10+ tells from you asking about can you come explore Umbral Plains with us.<br>
<br>
At that point it seemed like a big deal.<br>
<br>
It seemed like such a big deal that you needed to come to numerous boards posting how this great &quot;injustice&quot; was played upon you.<br>
<br>
Obviously it meant such a big deal to ya to post.<br>
<br>
I am glad you moved on. <br>
<br>
Why start tossing in gear and stats and such into the fray. If you want to start a pissing match. I think you are severely underequiped for such a battle of wits my friend.<br>
<br>
Have fun on the &quot;thousands&quot; of other raids. I know I can sleep well with the thought that.<br>

Let me see...  I will try to make a better saying and not be so contrite.<br>
<br>
Saas sh!t in his pants now he has to wipe it.<br>
<br>
That better?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
New book will be titled, &quot;People Hate Me:  The Brutal Truth Friend or Foe&quot;<br>
<br>
Hey Saas,<br>
Like I said I don't know you and couldn't give a sh!t about what is said or rumored about you.  I judge people by interaction in game or their posts on these boards (which your posts are making you look like a dumbass).  Until you wrong me I won't say, &quot;Saas is a sh!thead.&quot;  People that judge others by rumors have not enough intellect to open a zip lock bag.  And btw I am unguilded.<br>

<br>
As far as the server firsts let me guess, first person to buy an ebay character. First person to kill a moss snake. First person to figure out where the flame boards were and make a &quot;im the hero&quot; post. Get a life.<br>
<br>
Saying that you have true friends left that give you a JADE reaver just stuns me to thinking that i've misread this whole post. Obviously if they are giving you that UBER of an item you have to be right.<br>
<br>
My question in all of this would be why are you no longer a part of your former guild if they didnt think what you did was screwed up in the first place? Obviously since you are no longer a part of your &quot;former&quot; guild you did something to make them /gr you or you felt the pressure and /gr'd yourself. <p> [b]Trivilus Nightblade[/b]
