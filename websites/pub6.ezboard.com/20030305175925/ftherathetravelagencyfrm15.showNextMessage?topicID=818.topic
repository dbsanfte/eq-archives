I can't stand liars.  Trranquil is both.<br>
<br>
Today we were tooling around in the Arena and killed the Gkrean Prophet which dropped the Gauntlets of Iron Tactics.  Not necessarily the most uber item in the world, but nice and certainly an upgrade to some of our members.  <br>
<br>
I did not loot the corpse because it had lots of stuff on it, we were dealing with adds, and in the fracas I didn't realize they weren't no drop.  Just as the loot coordinator realized we'd be tied up with adds for a bit and told me to grab them if they were droppable, I saw Trranquil standing next to the Gkrean prophet bod.  Ugly green robe.  Eyepatch.  Always bad news.  I immediately start trying to loot the corpse - rut roh.  Trranquil doesn't move and the corpse doesn't free.  It is only when I stare him down as only a Erudite High Priestess with a Hammer of Judgment in her hand can that he scurries off like the rodent he is - of course taking the gaunts with him (OK, OK I admit that I intimidate absolutely no one and that he was just waiting for the corpse timer to free up.  /sheesh) .  <br>
<br>
I send him a /t telling him to bring them back or else.  No answer.  OK, fine.  That's what  /report was made for.  So I /report and I tell my guildies what happened.  Another of my guildies then comes back about 20 seconds later to report elatedly that Trranquil is &quot;happy to give back the 10 pp he looted from the corpse&quot;.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for Trranquil, there was no money on the corpse to give back, since I'd already gotten that 2 pp when I looked on the corpse the first time before turning back to the adds we were dealing with.  But Trranquil's facile storytelling did have one real benefit -- it clarified for me and others that Trranquil was not just a common back-alley ninja thief, but was instead an irredeemably ignorant lowlife lying ninja to boot.  That, admittedly, is something special.<br>
<br>
I do not know what discussion my guildie ultimately had with him other than promising him not to report the matter to the RTA (a promise I made clear I was not going to honor since that's my call, not my guildmate's).  I do know the discussion I had with Trranquil, which amounted to &quot;I do hope those gaunts are worth your pennyante rep because I've /reported and am already writing my RTA post while I med up here&quot;.  No one will ever know whether it was the presumably-gentle moral suasion of my guildie or my threat to tear him a new reputational you-know-what combined with the soon-to- be-raised cain with the GMs, but ultimately Trranquil told my guildie he would return the gaunts.<br>
<br>
But not without some more lies and -- since he's clearly got the upper hand -- some demands of his own.<br>
<br>
Since I try desperately to understand people's motives for doing things that make no sense in anyone over the age of 5, at some point I ask him point blank why he lied to my guildie about having looted plat when in fact he took the gaunts.  I get no direct answer to this question. Instead, I get only the trademarked ninja refrain - the corpse was just lying there so I assumed you didn't want them.  (I guess watching 17 people killing multiple giants right next to the corpse which had 29 minutes still on it didn't give him a clue.)  OK I try a different approach, and ask him what he was doing up there near our group in the first place since Kael was practically deserted today.  He said he was pulling for his group.  Level 42 monk.  From the Arena.  Right....<br>
<br>
Trranquil then decides that he has gained so many points from agreeing to return the gaunts that he can afford to go from back alley lowlife thief and liar to high-level white-collar-criminal negotiator.  Although he's *already agreed* to return the gaunts to my guildie, he makes an attempt to condition the return on me *not* bringing the incident to the RTA or the GMs since &quot;your guildmate promised&quot;.  Needless to say, tactics like this do not work to smooth the waters when one has been caught with one's fingers in yon cookie jar.  And needless to say I don't keep my guildmate's promises about my personal conduct when they don't check with me before making them.  But, hey, at least I don't lie <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
In sum, Trranquil is a liar and a thief whose only redeeming quality is that he can be scared shitless into doing right from wrong.  He gets the latter acknowledgement only because he did finally give the gaunts back, to his (very small) credit.  That the &quot;truly right&quot; thing would have been not to steal and lie straightaway might become evident to him sometime in the next life -- since he's clearly talented at both in this one.<br>
<br>
Since he's unguilded (or was this morning) and could pop up at a corpse near you at anytime, I felt I should make sure everyone knows about him.  Sorry it's not as good a flame as others far more talented have posted.  But hey, I'm a lady <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bogfatherbellybarsh>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 947<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/2/02 8:14:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=813.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/other_stfuget.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Trranquil =42 Unguilded Monk = Thief and a Liar</span><hr size=1> Hrmm...A fungi twink, as I've seen.<br>

Appropriate use of name calling...however, I think style could have been a lil better, you know we can use the word fuck now on the flame board... -1 for no profanity.<br>
