(I'll prolly get flamed by some clowns who heard something from someone who heard something bad about me... more on this later) but I'd like to let peeps know what  and  guilds are up to currently.<br>
      I was in Umbral Planes early today soloing some named when I noticed that Rubblecrunch and Zelnithwak had just popped. I sent some tells and before long we had a group and a half. Long story short, we keeld those 2. Now Doomshade was ready to be triggered. I pulled all 4 DM's single, triggered DS, and pulled him single to zone. (who needs monks?) J/K! We had DS at 39% when one of our healers missed a CH, needless to say, we died.<br>
      A couple hours had passed by this time and a couple group members had raids on elem planes or some such thing. Slimenim tells the group, &quot; hey i can try to get a couple peeps to help out&quot; I said sure np we popped him might as well kill him or some guild will just do it. <br>
     5-10 minutes later the whole yamanooby and circles rearend guilds show up. I was like wtf, but I invited people to my mini raid. We started buffing and goin over strat when kenshirro (lead yamanooby joker) heard something he didnt like and told me to stfu or go home and told everyone to leave the raid. They formed a new raid and did'nt invite me or any of the original crew. Then, they proceeded to gank Doomshade. I realize this is not illegal or that anyone even cares about me, I just wanted people to be aware of the actions of  and .<br>
     In closing to the people who might flame me for this..<br>

     ...your opinion means less than nothing to me!!!<br>
     People say saas has a bad rep but I NEVER did anything to anyone who didnt start shit with me 1st! I am either THE nicest guy or THE biggest jerk, so if I was a dick to you... you DID do something to deserve it and I'm prolly not the only one who has had a problem with you.                                                                             And to the yamanoobies and circles rearends that will come here and post shit, what you did today was fucked. You're guild leader is a pos, and from what I saw today, your guild is also. You can LIE all you want, but deep inside you know the truth, seek therapy. And if any of you EVER get grow the nuts to duel me (tuvtonic the biggest shit talker of them all, lvl 65 wizard,) say the words, I'll make you into as many corpses as you're ego can handle. pwnt. Fucks like you are the reason I have a bad rep. Peac<br>

Thats how i read it...<br>
NOT that they had wiped and hours after the wipe the recruitment for help was done.<br>
<br>
Correct me if im wrong, but you and i are seeing the time passed differently. As i see it.. it was time passed since they started the whole raid.... you are seeing it as time passed since the wipe.<br>

When you actually grow up and join the rest of us in the real world, you'll realize we don't give a fuck about giving back what's due to some fucking prick, this case being you.  Cheers to CoN, SoY, and Ken for finally teaching this prick something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malakarude>MalakaRude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User and Abuser!</span><br>  Posts: 544<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/23/03 5:27 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dhbergen/malaka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &lt;Shadows of Yaman00bie&gt; and &lt;Circles rear End&a</span><hr size=1> saas was cool when he was in VoF.

If that's the case, then ye have no reason to gripe as ye seem to be expectin to hold that MOB fer as long as ye like.  Not happenin'<br>

If ye were huntin fer hours BEFORE ye tried him, folks died then left, and as folks were leavin ye started callin in other troops and were then ganked by SoY and CE, then I can see yer point.<br>

<br>
long story short<br>
<br>
<br>
If someone Spawns/Triggers Doomshade and pulls him to kill it and FAILS, that Mob is now Up for Anyone to kill..(Or somewhere along those lines, just making it understandable)...<br>
<br>
And i believe  that several Hours had Passed after your failure to kill him, sooo...who'se the dumbass here?..<br>
<br>
But Training him and several mobs (About 30) around the zone until your &quot;Friends&quot; ...showed up  was also explained to you by a GM as Not Kiting.. ( as you had called it kiting him).<br>
<br>
And I still wonder how you got in our ( SoY/CE/ED) raid, because first of all, you werent guild tagged with none of the  3 that were there ( Last i saw you were a nice guy that was in VoF and didnt take too many things seriously, small attitude issue all i noticed, Ebay?)...<br>
<br>
If i Had the Log info i'd post it, but i barely use that Function anymore, I at one point acually considered you as a friend that i barely know, which is how i know about half of the Rathe server like that...<br>
<br>
What ya Did Yesterday was something a 13 year old with a credit card would only do...( im Really really hoping you ARE Ebay and that im not Pinning this on the Saas that i know know..know)..<br>
<br>
/Bird_Saas.<br>
<br>
and your train on us after the DS kill was Easily moveable with the little  Cost of my Alt's life, which bought others time to get away and come back..<br>

Then why post here?<br>
<br>
As to your rep, it has been my experieince that an individual is responsible for their own reputation.<br>
<br>
And most people here would be very tolerant of your obvious inability to use punctuation properly and capitalization and spelling issues, if you did not turn around and flame someone elses post on that point.<br>
<br>
So yes please type slower and read what you post, before you hit add reply.<br>
<br>
