Remember Somilia, we went there to help, we were greated by guns.  In Iraq there are about 5 other factions that the Bathe party has suppressed, once Saddam is gone, the internal fighting for power will resume as it had been before Saddam's Coup.

Then just come back to the USA and watch the world from afar like we did before WW2, close our borders (or at least put a restriction on the inflow) and just build up our defenses and economy. Don't get involved again till we get attacked (if someone can get through and successfully attack us), blow who ever it is to atoms and come home. We did 90% of the work in Bosnia, 90% of the work in Iraq the first time, and 80% of all UN peace keeping missions and now we are barbarians. Well us barbarians should let the french have their ungodly unemployment rate, Russia can keep killing all its civilians by &quot;accident&quot;, Germany have its race riots, and china and north Korea can blow each other and everyone else to pieces for all we should care. Let the true animals wipe themselves out.<br>

They will come begging us to help them during a war, they will come asking where all our food and money aid has gone, they will come asking us for help with their business.

Ok, random France bashing done, but lets look at this. Saddam Hussein quite obviously poses a threat to many people, Arabs, Isreali's, Palastinians, Iranians, Americans, and yes, French.<br>
<br>
We went to war in 91 against saddam, and although victorious in terms of surrender, we didnt force the terms to include prosecution of Saddam for war crimes. I have heard many times that this war was for oil. This is rediculous. There are MANY other sources for oil than Iraq. Russia, Alaska, UAE, Iran...the list goes on. Iraq committed a crime against humanity for MONEY, in the form of oil. USA desided this wasnt an acceptable practice, and at the request of Kuwait and other middle eastern states, we intervened.<br>
<br>
Now Saddam has restocked weapons (why? if he doesnt plan to attack anyone else?), hidden them away, and so rumor has it, conspired to sell certain weapons to terrorist...again for money.<br>
<br>
Saddam wants 2 things...money and power. Money IS power on the world stage. He is willing to do anything in his current power to obtain these things. Therein lies the threat to the entire world.<br>
<br>
Yes Malaka, you and your fellow countrymen are entitled to your opinion. The fact that you are not secure in it enough that you have to spout off stats that others feel the same way as your ONLY defense of it though, doesnt lend it any credence in my eyes. <br>
<br>
I would also like to know where this 90% figure comes from. That is approx. 4 billion of the 4.5 billion people in the world...Not to even suggest that you go poll all 4.5 billion, but Id like to know where the sampling was taken? France? Germany? San Francisco? The Kennedy compound? 90% is a BIG number on ANY controversial issue...in fact I think by definition its no longer contraversial at a 90/10 split.<br>
<br>
I agree that we should remove Saddam from power. I fear though the repercussions of instating a democratic gov't in any country where the citezens didnt fight for it themselves. The countries where democracy has worked were countries that fought against dictatorial regimes. these people have no understanding of the ideals of democracy, and without that it is a doomed system. I dont know what else to do, but Im fairly sure that democracy wont work with these people.<br>
<br>
The Roman Empire also had a senate, but for a good portion of that empires existance, the senate had no power. Just because WE say they have a 3 branch democratic gov't with checks and balances, unless those in power understand and believe in it, it wont work.<br>
<br>
Regardless of these apprehensions about where Iraq will be after the war, ther NEEDS to be a war. Every day that Saddam has his weapons and means of selling them (which he does, dont fool yourself), he poses more and more risk to EVERY country in the world that he may be able to profit from.<br>

<br>
But i wont. Why you may ask? there are some reasons.<br>
<br>
1- It is a EQ board, and i read it not to argue over RL fact. i prefer some good flames about ingame characters.<br>
2- It has been already argued on every single messageboard.<br>
3- what would be the use of arguing over it?? would it have ANY use? would that solve the problem? No. Story is already written. UN will say no to the war, probably without the need of any veto, USA will still go because anyway, it is too late to back off, UN will probably disolve after that war, end of the story.<br>
<br>
So i prefer reading all those threads, and having a good laugh at all the things you invent on us.

But I see alot of you think the same way, you just sugar coat it with different words.<br>
<br>
This thread wreaks of Political bullshit. I'm surprised Alistriwen isn't here posting, he always loved that mindless politics babble. God, he was more annoying than I can be.<br>
<br>
Fench French French, blah blah blah. I dare someone here have the balls to flame the Middle East as I have once tried without it being snatched up off this board, sprayed with Lysol, and deleted as mine have a few times.<br>
<br>
I don't know where that thread is (FC has millions now) but I got responses something along the lines as..... Drache, if you can't learn to live in harmony other people, then you need some counseling d00d..... Drache, you are criminally insane (or sick, or evil...I forget) because you think we should melt the Middle East. <br>
<br>
Alot of you are saying the same things I have but you aren't getting graphic.<br>

I generally think your posts are very well thought out and site good reasons for your opinions. The statement about 90% didn't however, and I keep hearing that number on this thread and wondered where it came from. It may be a &quot;reputable&quot; source, but like you say about CNN, they are not always reputable. If their sampling was from the places I listed, then it will quite obviously be distorted.<br>
<br>
Barring my opening jokes, I didnt slam you or France...this just isnt the place for that. I tried to post some of the valid factual reasoning behind our current situation. We could go back 60 years, and say that its all our fault from the beginning (and MOST of this could have been avoided, hindsight is 20/20, but it all seemed right at the time). <br>
<br>
Fault doesnt change the current situation though. What do we do now to protect ourselves and the rest of the world? Appeasing an evil dictator in the name of peace has never worked before, and wont work now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkoak>DarkOak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Blade</span><br>  Posts: 519<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/13/03 5:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1092.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   oh.. almost forgot</span><hr size=1> Since you can't edit your posts here..<br>

But then we all knew that before, so that is no revelation there.<br>
<br>
We lead every relief project in the world. EVERY!!!  Earthquakes, Floods, regicide, etc. You name it.  It doesn't matter if it is across the world or even in an area that doesn't even like us (well until we are saving their asses that is).  We go and help.  In EVERY disaster relief project, the first people you will see is the AMERICAN Red Cross.  The UN Peacekeeper force is a total farce.  Our CITIZEN's go help, not just the professionals.<br>
<br>
Our citizens are not willing to sit and watch world atrocities happen just to save face in the world community.  Our citizens are willing to put themselves at risk to solve problems that only vaguely threaten our way of life.  Our citizens gladly wear our Nation's colors because we KNOW OUR WORTH TO THE WORLD.<br>
<br>
So you sit back and enjoy as we try to solve problems and issues that you are more than willing to sweep under the rug and try to forget they exist.<br>
<br>
Go ahead..Bash and put down Americans and the American way of life.  Guess what - We don't care.  We will still help where we are needed because we know that is what a member of the human race should do.  Because that is what we do. We Help..We always have and always will.<br>
<br>
Call us Barbarians and Warmongers.  We don't hear you.  The minute one other country puts forth the effort that we do to help others then we will listen to what you have to say.  Until then, STFU and stay in the shallow end.  The Deep End is for those with the courage to fight, scratch, and claw to make this world a better place.  <br>
<br>
Everytime you put us down or call us hatemongers or whatever, it just makes me more Proud to be an American.<br>
<br>
As I said earlier - WE KNOW OUR WORTH TO THE WORLD - DO <br>
YOU?<br>
<br>
Ohh and Europe - Why don't you pay us back the Billions of dollars in War reparations you owe us.  Ahhh that's right...We let you slide on that didn't we.  FUCK OFF.<br>
