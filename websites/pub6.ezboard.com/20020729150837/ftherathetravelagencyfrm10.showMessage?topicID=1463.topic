Even though it is not a conscious choice, it is still a choice and you CAN choose not to be repulsed.<br>Actually there is no way you can say &quot;I can't&quot; when it comes to feelings, it is always &quot;I won't&quot; because noone is ruling your feelings.<br>And if they do feel attacked they will have the guts to tell you that they do and take responsability for feeling that way - just like you are responsible for being upset.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Changing others</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Some people get upset because &quot;if he/she can't see what I want then he/she doesn't love me&quot; but love is not about guessing other peoples desires. Our mother did that, it was her job to know when we needed changing or feeding or sleep but our adult life involves a greater deal of responsability and if there is something that we need then we have to inform the world.<br>Example:<br>He goes to get something to drink and doesn't ask her if she wants anything, doesn't take anything back for her.<br>She gets upset because she is thirsty and is insulted because he didn't ask her.<br>This is easily solved by her saying: &quot;I would be happy if you would ask me if I am thirsty when you go get something for yourself&quot; or even better - she says when he gets up &quot;I am thirsty, will you bring me a glass of whatever?&quot; Remember that it is not the other persons job to fulfill your needs - so don't get angry if they forget it or say no...it's called freedom of choice. And if the other person says no, you don't need an explanation, demanding an explanation would be not accepting that the other person has a valid reason to say no.<br><br>You can never change another person to fit your desires, you can both make compromises to ensure that all normal and neurotic patterns are silenced - another example:<br>He lets the toilet seat up and she puts it down.<br>Forget making him take it down, if it means that much to you, ask him to do it, but don't demand it and don't get upset if he won't. Of course this also applies to the man who wants her to put it up.<br>If he won't or he doesn't remember then you'll have to do it yourself. This is quite fair as it is YOUR need to have it down, not his.<br><br>So I know a few women who might say at this point: &quot;But it's not just the toilet seat, it's his dirty socks on the couch, traces of soap in the sink, squeezing of the tube of toothpaste, not taking his glass out when done drinking etc etc&quot; How can I just &quot;accept&quot; all this?<br><br>You can because it is YOUR needs, you can either work with yourself to be less neurotic-tidy or you can spend your time cleaning after him. If you want to live with him. Because this is how he is and his way is just as good as your way, but don't dream of changing him if he's not wanting it himself. The only person YOU can change...is you.<br><br>Someone might say: &quot;Why do I have to change and he doesn't?&quot;<br>You don't HAVE to, but if you want to live with this guy who is not as tidy as you and does not see it as a problem, you will spend a lot of energy on being pissed at him over that - if you don't change - you're the one who wants a change of things - not him. And changing does not mean feeling like a martyr suffering from a tyran who is untidy and repressing your needs for tidyness. <br>It means you learn to see that the world does not collapse because he leaves traces of soap on the sink and lets the toiletseat up. <br>You can live with it and not give it a thought either because you simply clean up after him because you like the tidyness or you learn to live with it being a little messy.<br><br>This however does not apply to being in relationsships with people who have real problems like alcoholics, gameaholics, drugaddicts, psychopats and what not.<br>A totally different set of rules apply here.
