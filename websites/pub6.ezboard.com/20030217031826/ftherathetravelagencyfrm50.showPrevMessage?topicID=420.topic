First when guilds are working on getting on a new rotation there has been problems from the ones who are already on it. I'm going to stick with AoW and what I see as wrong in my views and if you want to damn me for it, go right ahead.<br>
<br>
VoF tried and failed on AoW. They did Idol unslowed and whooped his backside, so in doing that, they went for AoW and failed. The debate now is VoF may not do this again back to back, or possibly till they get their next Statue rotation, so that AoW will not be wasted. What the hell do you mean they can't try again or anyone else?<br>
<br>
How many times did the paving guilds try AoW, and fail? Back to back, over and over to get there. No one told you that you couldn't do that and now to bring out this hidden rule is crap. I respect the leading guilds of the Rathe and the leaders from it, but I do not respect the stance that if you fail then shut up, sit down, and we will tell you when you can try again. If the mob is up and you are not on rotation and the guild who is up doesn't do it, then it should be open for those who can try. The Idol has been up for days at times and no one did anything, so this rule is wrong as can be.<br>
<br>
Bots, NB, Sot, and TL I believe all got shots over and over to get on the rotation. They earned that spot thru hard work and dedication to doing the raid. They put in alot of effort to learn and kill him. Now why should anyone, tell, anyone else that they can't do the same? VoF failed on AoW and they have come under fire, but I can bet you that their next attempt they will not fail and they will become one on the rotation.<br>
<br>
Several times now have hidden rules been brought up to upcoming guilds and those rules that come up are for one thing. To insure that the progress of those guilds are slowed. This is not right and is wrong because not one person said, ok you cant do this, to the ones who tried first. The old argument that no one else was doing it so it was open doesn't mean much cause when two guilds got on then that went out the door. Now I know that posting here in this forum might piss off the admins but not everyone can post in the guild rep forum and others have a right to say things. <br>
<br>
As I have said the top guilds on this server earned their way and respect thru hard way and dedication to things. Don't you think that those new guilds coming up should have the right to the same respect and be proud of winning on those uber mobs like you did?  <br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>

You are wrong. Do you think that there is a giant 'uber' guild conspiracy to keep content from the other guilds on the server? Ok, lets imagine if this was true. <br>
<br>
Why, then, if the goal of the big guilds was to keep the little guy down, why would guilds ever leave a rotation? That is a simple, and easy way to delay content. It would only take BotS or Tindi an extra 40 minutes of their day to zap the AoW on their turn, if that. <br>
<br>
Firstly, anything at the velious level is now so far below the radar of &quot;uber&quot; that it may as well be old world content. United necros could be permafarming nagafen for all anyone cares, really, and that progression holds, minus the rotations, all the way to the highest end game. You think a guild in Vex Thal gives a flying rats ass if a mob they have no interest in is permafarmed? Hell no. <br>
<br>
There is no &quot;i'm so uber&quot; conspiracy. Just isn't. People who think there is have one of two problems; dillusions of grandeur or a thin grasp of reality. <br>
<br>

This argument is flawed on the basis that it does not account for the fact that conditions can change with time. The reason that no one said &quot;you can't do this&quot; to the first people to do it, is that there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>were</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> no other people on the rotation. Now that there are, there is a level of courtesy that must be maintained between guilds. Saying that the first guilds to kill the AoW didn't need to be courteous is at worst misdirection; at best, a misunderstanding of the reasons for courtesy. If I was the only one in the world with a car, I wouldn't have to signal before changing lanes, for example. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This statement weakens, not strengthens, your arguement, because it's true. <br>
<br>
As soon as another guild killed the AoW, the first guild in established a rotation with them; that is, began to be courteous to others on the rotation. If there are no others on a rotation, there is no one to be courteous to. Arguably, it's not even a rotation. <br>
<br>

Yeah, look at me, I'm spitting angry at you. Die die die. /yawn. <br>
<br>
Not hardly. The post was moved there because it was going to turn into a flame festival if not talked about by the leaders/reps of the guilds. Quite honestly, people talk differantly in differant forums. And in the reps forum, people don't flame (or at least try not to).<br>

No one is saying that we can't get on the rotation. All that is being discussed is how to make that entry as simple for the people trying to get on as possible, while making sure that those who have gone before do not get disrupted so badly as to make it *not* worthwhile to let new guilds on. <br>
<br>
That is in *everyone's* interest.<br>

Nycah's idea that you need to wait a rotation turn to attempt AoW again is a compromise. You won't like it, but guess what.. it's at least fair.<br>

<br>
BOTS/NB/SOT/TINDI<br>
Bots got thier first made as many attempts as they please till he was dead and had solo rights till another guild tried.<br>
NB/SOT<br>
Both killed withing the same time frame and tried ONLY on thier statue attempts, and had the ability to try mulitple times because AOW was NOT a spawnable mob at this point he stayed up till dead.<br>
Tindi <br>
Killed shortly there after and again only tried on thier attempts of statue.<br>
<br>
When your dealing with gettin on a rotation it has ALWAYS been understood that you didnt take back to back attempts on a mob to prevent perma camping.<br>
Shit if we didnt have this rule VOF and 10 other guilds could keep AOW Tied up for several months never to let the guilds who can do him.<br>
<br>
There is no big concert to prevent anyone from joining a rotation, shit if there was we would disband rotations and I garuntee you alot of guilds who see some content now wont see jack crap up for them to kill again.<br>
<br>
NB/BOTS/TINDI would be takeing stuff VOF/LOM/ED have thier sights on constantly and VOF LOM ED would be takeing stuff that CB/CON/VOLS etc... and so on everyone will be feedin off tier mobs of other guilds and in the end no one but the top3 maybe even less will make any type of progression.<br>
<br>
The system the way it is now is that EVERYONE progresses. If POP was the last Expansion for the next 2 years EVERY guild currently on rotations would eventualy hit the pinacle , the reason for this is because of rotations.<br>
If not for the rotations it wouldnt become a level ground it would be a pyramid, haveing 1-3 guilds at the very top and everyone else below them and others.<br>
<br>
Before you feel that you are &quot;robed&quot; from a attempt, or that our system seems unfair please go to other servers where there is no rotations, no community respect etc...<br>
<br>
As far as I can see this is the most fair system available. in all actuality I dont think anyone ever in a game enviroment such as this could come up with a more fair system of shareing. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lvcm.com/hasse/vincesig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>

I think it makes sense for AoW.  In theory a guild could try and fail 5 times in a row before actually killing him thus &quot;taking away&quot; content from other guilds for weeks.  Other mobs, like Statue for instance, are not &quot;taken away&quot; from other guilds just because another guild tries them...the only inconvenience at all is they need to wait until the guild is done trying.  Spawns aren't lost if a guild tries most other rotation mobs and fail, so it just seems odd that the back-to-back rule would apply to them.<br>
<br>
VoF doesn't feel other uber guilds have tried to hold them down...not at all.  If anything has troubled us, it's the fact that 1) There appeared to be somewhat of a double standard since LoM tried AoW twice pretty close together, and didn't get jumped on for it, and 2) The emergence of a fairly outdated rule that just doesn't make sense for the present situation.<br>
<br>
In the end, the main issue is that VoF and others want to take AoW down, but we (The Rathe community) need to decide what rules we (VoF) and others should abide by as to be fair to the guilds already on the rotation.  On the same note, we should try to sort out issues like these for other mobs BEFORE up and coming guilds get to the point of trying them (I believe Emil said he was going to think of other unwritten rules like these to do just that). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malakarude>MalakaRude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF Rep</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/19/02 3:18:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=410.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dhbergen/malaka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AoW and the Guild Rep forum</span><hr size=1> Darkoak, I never saw any whining from me. i just stated facts.

<br>
Ive seen (and my guild/alliance is only on 1 rot at this point) MANY concessions from the larger guilds to let new guilds onto various rotaions. In fact, this entire issue doesnt even stem from the next guild on AoW rot, but from the server reps as a whole. This is a valid concern.<br>
<br>
Because of the &quot;testability&quot; of this mob (which youve passed), and Sony's ability to stir controversy, we see yet another part of our gameplay that we need to monitor ourselves for OUR own benefit...(its obvious sony doesnt give a shit). <br>
<br>
Nycah's suggestion seems quite fair to me (and Im a long way off from AoW.) It practically PUTS you on rotation, as once you kill statue, you immediately have a chance at idol/AoW.<br>
<br>
I could be misunderstanding some of what the rotation/spawning entails, but I think Im accurate. Our system is truly designed and run to be fair to all...including the little guy, the gettin big guy, and the guy thats already there.<br>

<br>
Moving on:<br>
<br>
Yeah, the problem with making the statue/idol/AoW a ladder from one to the other is that the statue is little better than vindi once slowed, thus is a giant p00sae compared to Idol unslowed and AoW. As a result, more people can kill the statue than the AoW. That means that VoF would have to wait...(looking at the rotation) 9 pops of the statue instead of just skipping one possible attempt at the AoW. <br>
<br>
Since the idol drops zero loot and is very much like the AoW if left unslowed, it's coming to a general acceptance that the Idol/AoW should not be linked to the statue, BUT that there should be provisions to keep at least 1 in 2, and hopefully 2 in 3 pops to people on the rotation, considering the quality of loot that drops in that encounter. <br>
<br>
That's me tho. <br>

Why should we be allowed (at the time) to waste AoW after AoW until we get it right, when BotS at the time could kill him and benefit from the loot.  Thinking any other way about it, is greedy and selfish.  The AoW rotation isn't that big, so I don't see why VoF shouldn't wait for one cycle of AoW rotation or their next Statue (whichever is first) to try him.  I was unaware of LoM trying him close to back to back, and if they did, well shame on them.  That doesn't make it ok for VoF to try and get the rules changed for them.  Just because O.J got away with murder, doesn't mean you disregard murder as a crime.<br>
<br>
Additionally, as VoF learned first hand, killing Idol unslowed is *close* to AoW, but they are not one and the same.  AoW has a lot more hp, so you have to keep up your perfect healing rotation a lot longer.  Idol is exactly identical to the Statue, not AoW, so there is a difference of about 200k hp there.  <br>
<br>
I feel the same way about &quot;racing&quot; to AoW that I do about &quot;racing&quot; to CT.  While in the case of CT, I as a guild leader *cannot* enter the zone of Fear before the current guild is done, it technically isn't against the rules to be in Kael while guild X is doing Statue on my AoW rotation turn.  It wouldn't be against the rules, but how many of you want 50-70 NB, BotS, or Tindi waiting at the see invis giants near the arena while you're doing Statue, or worse, trying him for the first time?  &quot;Racing&quot; to AoW is thus different from Zland or Vindi, or Yeli etc, because there IS a rotation dependency here.  Until Statue dies, the guild up for AoW cannot take their turn, and thus they are &quot;beaten&quot; merely because of a dependency on others to take their turn on Statue.<br>
<br>
VoF being able to use a euro time advantage to try AoW after AoW isn't &quot;fair&quot; to those guilds who can already kill AoW and benefit from the loot.  As for whether or not it will take you 1 more or 10 more attempts is not the issue, as you can't guarantee either.  What I can show you is that every guild on the rotation HAS proven they can kill him and not blow the mob.  Until you can, you shouldn't expect your version of &quot;fairness&quot;.  Once you do, then you're on rotation, and you get your shot like everyone, and will understand how someone complaining they can't just keep trying him is a horribly unfair proposition.<br>
<br>
To summarize briefly, no guild not on AoW rotation should be allowed to try more than once per cycle (as it always has been), because of the rotation dependency of Statue.  Quite simply, until Statue is dead, NO ONE can kill AoW, and thus any &quot;race&quot; is a farce. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>

So you leave NB with a choice if LoL kills late tonight - let VoF try AOW a second time since we saw him last (yes, that's right, a *non-rotational guild* getting more turns than one a rotational one), or try with forces that might not be enough and wind up wasting an AoW ourselves. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>

When you, SoT, and TL started trying AoW, you 3 along with BotS were the only guilds on the Statue rotation.  You could make an attempt every 20 days, but probably faster with patches.<br>
<br>
Now, there are 9 active guilds on the Statue rotation, and that number will increase steadily in the future.  So guilds wanting to try now would probably have to wait at least 30-35 days in between attempts (and that's accounting for some patches speading it up).  Guilds coming on the Statue rotation now would probably have to wait as long as 50 days in between attempts by the time they are AoWable.<br>
<br>
We're bringing up points of what BotS, TL, NB, SoT have done in the past.  This is obviously done to provide the arguement of &quot;It worked for us so it should for you.&quot;  All things being equal, it would be fair to keep those rules.  Things are NOT equal though, and rules should be modified.  Just because a rule worked for guilds once, doesn't mean that rule shouldn't evolve with changing circumstances.  The past AoW rule is outdated, and should therefore be revised...it's as simple as that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karadin>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM<BR>

However, I fail to see the fairness where guilds that have not proven themselves capable of being on rotation get MORE chances at a mob that guilds that have proven themselves.  Killing every other AoW or every AoW till you get it right is downright unfair.  And citing LoM or FK or whoever as having done this already is by no means a proof of fairness.  It brings to mind when I was young and my sister would demand to get to stay up till my bedtime, just because I did.  Simply, two wrongs don't make a right, and LoM committing what is in my opinion, an infraction, doesn't mean that VoF gets to.  I just don't keep tabs on other guilds enough to track what they are up to on any given night.<br>
<br>
Rotations are about sharing content between those who can kill, making sure said mobs die, and maximizing the loot brought onto the server on a weekly basis.  Guilds that prove themselves capable get to be on said rotations - how is it fair that guilds NOT on a rotation can threaten to risk every or every other spawn of a mob they aren't on rotation for.  Guilds on rotation should see the mob on rotation at least as often as those attempting to get on, especially for mobs that are &quot;wasted&quot; when you try them.  Even on a mob that isn't wasted would wear my patience thin if night after night Guild ABC was keeping us from him by trying him time and again.  Escalate that to a mob that poofs when you fail, and it becomes even more heinous.<br>
<br>
Emp is the same way, so please don't complain how it's just the Big Three trying to keep the up and coming guilds down.  We are about to try Emp.  BotS got to do Emp to their heart's content until they got him right, that is the benefit of being first.  We have more information about the fight than they did, that is the advantage of coming along later.  I shouldn't be allowed to night after night keep popping and wasting chances for Tindi or BotS to get loot off Emp &quot;just cause we think we got it licked this time&quot;.  (Emp isn't wasted per se, but he can only be spawned once every so many hours - thus keeping rotation guilds from trying mobs they have proven they can kill).<br>
<br>
To summarize, I am ok with a change of the Statue rule, but you cannot deny the linkage of the Idol to Statue making any &quot;race&quot; a farce.  However, I will not watch VoF or any guild pop and risk multiple AoWs to NB's one per cycle.   We've proved ourselves, and once you do (not if), you will see things quite a bit differently than you do now.  You will appreciate not having to watch Guild ABC pop and waste 4-5 AoWs in 5-10 spawns so that you get to wait for them to finally kill it before you get to loot him again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bogarthamule>Bogarthamule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/20/02 4:09:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=410.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AoW and the Guild Rep forum</span><hr size=1> I understand perfectly that rules for rotations are made to help not only current rotation guilds but future ones as well.

That's a good point concerning a non-rot guild getting more chances at a mob than a rot guild.  Really, that does not seem fair, but...<br>

As I pointed out before, I don't think it's fair to use a rule that will eventually be harder on other guilds down the line.  When just BotS, TL, and NB were on the AoW rotation, then a guild trying to get on the rotation would only have to wait 3 spawns to get their shot.  The next guild would have to wait 4.  Now an arguement can be made that getting there first gives them that luxury of not having to wait as long, but when dealing with multiple guilds all getting on rotation around the same time, that issue shouldn't hold up as much (Just look at the additions to the NToV rotation lately...any one of those guilds could have cleared the following week or the previous week...was just chance that the guilds entered in the order they did).<br>
<br>
Even if guild A having to wait 4 spawns, then guild B having to wait 5 spawns, then guild C having to wait 6 is a fair rule...I do NOT think guild J (obviously way down the line) having to wait 13 spawns in between attempts is fair.  Controlling the amount of attempts by how many guilds are on a rotation is not going to be fair to guilds in the future since the rotations will generally always get bigger.  That's the exact reason waiting for Statue turn doesn't work now.  Maybe the fair way NOW would be to use Karadin's point of only trying AoW once per rotation cycle, but that rule will eventually become unfair the way the old rule has become.<br>
<br>
Like I said, the point of non-rot guilds getting more attempts than rot guilds IS an important issue, but setting rules that we KNOW will eventually become unfair will cause problems.  Who's to say how many guilds will need to be on the AoW rot before this idea becomes unfair?  You can bet the first guild this rule actually hurts will be upset because of it.  I really think the most fair rule is one that will not change.  Whether it is 1 spawn between kills or 10 needs to be decided.  Whatever rule is decided, I think it's best to make it so similar problems won't happen in the future. (I think one way of doing this would be to set a &quot;penalty&quot; of sorts for if a guild failed two or maybe three times in a row...then that guild has to wait a month, two months, etc until they can try again...this might make a guild think twice to try everytime the rule allows them to if they just aren't ready yet) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thundaxstormkeeper>Thundax Stormkeeper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/20/02 7:09:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=410.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AoW and the Guild Rep forum</span><hr size=1> Why should rules that have existed for ages be changed now so that guilds currently trying AoW should have a better chance at getting on the rotation.<br>
<br>
Surely the pioneering the earlier guilds did should be to their advantage and not used as an example to give the guilds following them new and easier rules to join them on that rotation.<br>
<br>
For a guild currently on a rotation, I don't think many people really care if another guild joins that rotation. Everyone is used to the fact that as time goes on, more and more guilds will be killing each mob, What people don't want to be seeing is mobs going to waste. This is most noticable on AoW because after someone fails, it is 5 days before anyone can try again. Let's look at the current situation where both VoF and FK are looking at trying AoW and joining the rotation. If these guilds rushed to the mob each time Statue was being killed, no one else would see AoW again until both those guilds were on the rotation.<br>
<br>
Part of the advantage of being on a rotation is it is a guaranteed shot. You don't have to camp the mob so you can engage as soon as it spawns. You have the ability to check when it is up and then go and kill it. For this reasonl there is often plenty of hours of a mob being up before the guild on rotation for it will go there and attempt it. For this reason, there will always be time windows for mobs to be attempted by new guilds. If these guilds tried these mobs all night, and then came back the next night to try again it would be unfair as they are barring the rotation guilds from shots at their mobs.<br>
<br>
Rules are made to protect guilds currently on a rotation and also those who will be on that rotation in the future. If everyone abides by them, things run smoothly. Otherwise, problems arise and everyone will end up unhappy.<br>

Because times change. The Statue rotation then was 3 guilds. Now it is 10 and will be growing again. A several week wait between attempts will not be palatable to any guild wanting on this rotation.<br>

We don't want an advantage, we want to NOT be penalized any more then you were however.<br>

You're being a tad alarmist, first of all assuming the guilds will just be slavering over the idol spawn, ignoring all over considerations like, oh, OTHER ROTATIONS, guild attendance that night, etc.  FK won't be taking a shot unless we are sure we can win without interference.<br>
<br>
And the flipside of that, I doubt very much that either guild will need more then 1 more shot each to enter the rotation.<br>
<br>
In short, there's no need to be obstructionary, and good reasons not to be.<br>
