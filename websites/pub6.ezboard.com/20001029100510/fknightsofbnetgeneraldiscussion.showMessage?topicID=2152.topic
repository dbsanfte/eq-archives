<br>
I havent been to busy posting to this forum since the EQ raid, I post alot on our EQ forum though and I have again started to think about something that I know some of us have mentioned earlier. I feel this is important and needs to be adressed by our guild.<br>
<br>
I think Natel said it pretty clear in his post where he wrote that multi online games in an ever changing world is the future of gaming as we know it. He also pointed out that we can fight it but it is only a matter of time until we all will be playing some kind of multi online game.<br>
<br>
I know why Diablo1 got so big and got some famous. It was basically because it was the best multi online game there was on the market at that time in gaming history.<br>
<br>
Todays edge on online gaming history when it comes to rpg games in ever changing worlds it is EQ that is on the top.<br>
This will how ever change and I would like for us all to have a friendly conversation about what will happen.<br>
<br>
First of all I want to clarify once again that EQ is the best as of today as we speek in what it offer and how the world is set up and so on amongst the Mulit player online games. Note that I am not comparing Diablo with EQ here, I am just saying that EQ is better than Asherons Call and Ultima Online1. If anyone feels anything else you are welcome to feel that way but by facts and measures EQ are the winner of todays multi player online games wich are rpg'ish.<br>
<br>
So imagine that EQ is teh real break maybe you can compare it to Diablo1 being the real break for rpg online, compare it with comand&amp;councer who was the first rts game(well dune was but still) you see where I am getting to. How will these games look in let say 5 years. By then all of us in this guild would be old and rich enough to be able to spend 10$ a month to play a game with friends online. <br>
<br>
I can how ever see 2 or 3 really big problems with this.<br>
<br>
First problem will be that there will be a bunch of games coming out soon wanting a share of the cake that EQ is almost dominating as we speak. So the problem with this is that people will buy different games and we might become split up.<br>
<br>
The next problem here is that all of us can buy all them games that come out and all of us can afford paying 10 buck a month for a game but not all can pay maybe lets say 40 buck for 4 games at the same time.<br>
<br>
Also these games do take alot of time investment since the it is a company behind them games they want to make money and how do they make money ? Yep thats right, by keeping you play. You play, you pay very easy to figure out why stuff takes so long in EQ if you think about it. If you stretch that thought abit there is no real concurance in the market right now and I can really see where the companies who follow can do great marketing plans stating that they have shorter downtime than EQ, and from there the ball will roll until you have a game like Diablo2 where interaction amongst players gets penalized since you have to fight non stop. Interaction amongst players are very encuraged in the multi online games as of today since they want you to get involved in the comunity to keep up the interest of the game so you can play more and pay more.<br>
<br>
So naturally we have the conclusion that EQ is not the best game of all time but I think some of us agree that it is the best choice we have as of today.<br>
<br>
But whith games that would whoop the floor of EQ around the corner we will have to talk about where we would like to move this guild so we can keep what I feel is the best comunity of all time.<br>
<br>
Here is list of some games I am reading alot about.<br>
<br>
Anarchy Online - For you that have played Mutant paper rpg's you will feel right at home in this game. It is basically EQ but 10000 years later so swap the elfs and dwarfs and magic spells with Robots, Genetic manipulated cybernetic gears and laser guns and swap the boats with space shuttles and you know what I mean I guess.<br>
<br>
Shadow bane - No need to mention this game I think since most of you probably have read more than me about it already. Basically it has taken all flaws from EQ and made a better game all in all with awesome guild support and functionality.<br>
<br>
Star Wars - This is a game where the name speak of itself. I will buy this game no matter how much it will cost, just to try it out. It is the same developers as EQ btw. Just imagine being a Jedi knight owning your own spaceship in a multi online universe based on Star Wars..wooohoooo.<br>
<br>
EQ 2 - This game might take along time but I guess the developers of EQ 1 will be forced to make this game one day if they want to keep their share of the market since of all the other planned games that are coming out.<br>
<br>
OU 2 - This will also be a killer I think. This is a game I am very interessted in. I hope it will get some good ground and I look forward to playing this game every time I read about it. <br>
<br>
There are even more but I get tired of listing all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Go read the web for more info.<br>
<br>
So what is wrong with buying all these games and trying them out and pic one we like.<br>
<br>
I can tell you what is wrong with that.<br>
<br>
55 days !!!<br>
<br>
That is how many days I have invested in my character in EQ.<br>
55 days is not something I just trow away like that.<br>
<br>
-Hey ! Look at this awesome new game called multi online killah, I just buy it and spend my 10 buck a month on this game and dump my 55 day wizzy from EQ in the trash.<br>
<br>
This is where I see a problem.<br>
<br>
I know some of you that only reached level 12 are already getting very atched to your characters in EQ. It only gets worse from there, trust me.<br>
<br>
So how is this all gonna end when we have members playing 10 different games and all are very atached to their characters within their game. I know that I will someday leave EQ for another game, it is unstoppable that it will happen.<br>
<br>
Another thing to think about is that it takes time to learn these damn games. Learning about all the creatures, all the lands, all the items, all the quests and npc's and so on. <br>
<br>
I can see alot of bad things happen to this guild as more and more of these games reaches the market. I just want us all to be prepared for it.<br>
<br>
I do not have any suggestion or I do not have any coments.<br>
I just want some friendly discussion about our guild in the future.<br>
<br>
Also I do not rule out that some will be playing Diablo2 for a long time to come and even I will pick it up again when expansion is out.<br>
<br>
...but the ever lasting question, where do we go from now ?<br>
<br>

In UO2 you are limited to 3 races...In Shadow bane, there are many more....and even more impressive is the fact that they take classes to a WHOLE new level.  There are sub-classes of subclasses!!!  heheh  You see, in Diablo 2, the Necro and Barb were quickly most peoples favorite because they were the most powerful.  In UO, the wizards ruled, and if you didnt have high level spells you could kiss your butt goodbye in PvP.  In EQ, the Necromancers are the most popular class hands down.  In ShadowBane, I think it will be much more difficult to determine if there is a singular most powerful class because they have 4 times as many as many other RPG's.  Just amazing.<br>
<br>
As for your guild change discussion...true, very true.  That was why I initially started that thread.  Change is a part of life, and people deal with change in many different ways.  Us EQ junkies have no right to tell the D2 players that they are stupid...because that is what they want to play.  In the future though, I dont see this guild staying as close without a common connection.<br>
<br>
My idea was to get almost every one of us to agree to play a MMORPG game like ShadowBane as soon as it comes out.  In this scenario, we would essentially become neighbors in the game...inserting ourselves into its economy and culture....and in our case because of our size...we would be able to AFFECT our surroundings and culture somewhat.  We would not be joining an existing gameworld that has been around for months and even years in UO or EQ's case.  We would grow with the game and the other gamers.  This type of thing appeals to me more than anything I can think of at the moment.<br>
<br>
Look friends....until you have really played an MMORPG, you just cannot grasp what it means to be in an area of a game with hundreds of people chatting, communicating, auctioning, and yes...FIGHTING together.<br>
EQ is nowhere near perfect, but I run across people every night that I have fought with, or sold High Quality Lion skins to, or asked for assistance from.  In other games like Diablo, Baldurs Gate, IceWind Dale, etc.  You are limited to 6-8 people, and must leave the game to get anymore socialization.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts, but I agree about one thing:  As the gaming industry progresses, the experience of immersion into your character expands so much.  10 years from now we will probably be sitting in our own computer chamber, self enclosed with surround sound speakers.  We will all be wearing body suits that and goggles that add to the realism of the event.....<br>
<br>
*knock knock* &quot;Chris! I told you to empty the fricking dishwasher!  Now get the hell out of your little Merlin world before I pop a cap in yo a$$!&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh well, I still welcome the day!<br>

As far as the MMORPG's are great comments go, I'd agree.  Still, I think that AC is the current cream of the crop, even though it's got the smallest membership of the three...besides, let's face it.  All three of them suck.  The next generation, and the generation after that, is where things are going to start getting interesting....</font><P>Lord Tiganos<br>

It's going to be out Q1 or Q2 of 2001. Its going to come with a kit for GM's to make there own games and worlds(rumor has it that you can purchase space on a server to have your world always running.). The game takes place in the Forgotten Realms setting just like Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate 2. <br>
<br>
The other one that might have potential is Star Trek:Bridge Commander. Finally we get to put our butts in the seat of the bridge. We finally can become our own Kirks or Picards...lol. Hopefully this one will offer muli-player options. If it does, expect to see the Knights of the Sacred Federation flying by in our own Enterprise E...lol.<br>
<br>
I agree about Fallout Tactics though. It looks awesome so far. The reviews so far say it plays great and I loved the first two games. In fact I still play them!<br>

Well, see you guys around,<br>

<br>
Yes, allthough I didnt forget Fallout Tactics since I have bean beating the first 2 games over and over since they came out I just dont feel the need to add it to this post.<br>
Last time I read about it I heard that it would involve multiplayer, but not Multi multiplayer in the terms of more than 2000 players at the same time.<br>
<br>
Also I did not include NeverWinterNights simply because it has to many limitations. Imagine I spend weeks on building up my world and put it on a server. Who is going to play on it. You all, the Kob will play on it. So there is 1 game world with 1 guild. Makes no sence to me. Also I wonder who is going to be able to get a full game going when we hardly can get a full game in Diablo2 or a full group in EQ. Neverwinter nights is a game that all needs to play at the same time as I understand it. Sure It sounds cool and all, but I see to many limitations for it to be really big.<br>
<br>
If it will come down to a vote one day I will vote for shadowbane as it seems today. Starwars I will get to try it out and I am very interessted in Anarchy Online I must say. UO1 was something I never liked but I hope UO2 will change that. All these games and all these choices.<br>
<br>
I feel that someday it wont be possible to hold this guild together anymore and I simply see the future in kob as an rpg guild with this forum in the bottom as it's corner stone. Well, maybe that day wont come until the next generation multi online games is out, but It sure takes for some good thinking and discussion to be prepared.<br>
