<br>
Actually, I didnt call anyone a lewt whore.<br>
<br>
Understand that my animosity lies with Deamentia and her brood. Mostly Deamentia. I'll never get said ex-FSer to admit it, but I'm pretty sure it was Deamentia.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, my point was moreso that its in huge offense that a Guild Leader, in an alliance would leave the said alliance on supposed &quot;good terms&quot; and then openly recruit members for all three of the other guilds in the alliance. Whether or not the recruiting was successful is irrelevant.<br>
<br>
5 OTHER members of Fallen Shadows were contacted by COMPLETE strangers wearing SOTE flags saying things like &quot;Leave that stupid guild and come join SOTE. &lt;name of EX-FSer here&gt; already joined us.&quot; and like I said, they responded with &quot;Who are you? Are you just doing a /who all &quot;Fallen Shadows&quot; 60 65, and asking whoevers names that come up to join you? Fuck off.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point, I take it upon myself to use some logic and dictate that at some point, somebody must've made it clear that FS was to be recruiting grounds for SOTE.<br>
<br>
As far as im concerned, thats a huge middle finger in my face. So THAT is where my animosity lies. If this is not a practice of SOTE, then fine. I honestly hope its not. But I will tell you this. It happened. And it happened by members of SOTE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kellek11@therathetravelagency>Kellek11</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/13/03 1:34:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=979.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shadows of the Eclipse......</span><hr size=1> First off, Shei isnt a leadership part of Sote.<br>
Second off they have not done anything obstrucitve towards any other guild. Third off if You gave Sote sot's reuptation you can go to hell. Coujo has very different rules Id imagine and isnt an asshole whatsoever. They respect peoples rotations and until some actually solid matter comes up I think you should STFU. Shadows of the Eclipse is Half SoT or Under, - Most of the bad people. Fablaar screwed up yes, but if u screwed up how would u like to be blacklisted for a dum inciddent like jboots? Im sure fab still doesnt do that noobish shit. Another factor being that Sote has progressed faster than any guild on the rather under bots within so little time is not a reason to bash them, and rather shows your envy for them.. -Kellek <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=princessabella>PrincessAbella</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/13/03 1:47:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=979.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.suburbanjungle.com/images/proud_furry_100_dk.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shadows of the Eclipse......</span><hr size=1> The way I heard it is Deamentia gave the FS member the offer to join Vampires at the moment the merge occured (FS member was on a raid with vampires/sote and thats how the individual got in SoTE with no aplication/vote stuff.

Im suprised this thread even came up, guess some people need to keep off other guilds websites and find something to bitch about elsewhere. Everyone knows Sote hasnt ever done anything, and doesnt have pure evil members that live to train / ks  like a certain shaman I know... After the Notouchie thread this compares to nothing and the people posting against Sote are a bunch of loosers anyways, If I was in a guild that had no future and saw a guild that did all this cool stuff under fast recovery and good leadership with all goals being met, i would bitch them out too... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=smeechboo>Smeechboo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/13/03 3:00:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=979.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shadows of the Eclipse......</span><hr size=1>  Well Kluz that didn't prove nothing to us officer.<br>

*sigh* Okay. I made it up. I made it up to flame you because I do that. a LOT. to people I dont know. In fact, Vamps were never in the alliance. They were never a guild. Neither is Fallen Shadows. Also, Everquest isnt a game. You're having a dream.<br>

What in the fuck does this have to do with anything?<br>
Look, if you dont want to admit your harboring trash, fine. I dont really care. SOTE matters to me about as much as I miss SoT. Truth is, theres a whole boatload of people in your guild that I love; That Kluz grew up with. My feelings towards those people extend past your guild tag.<br>
<br>
But if you dont want an explanation of hard feelings towards your members, dont express interest in getting one. And just to save you the post stating that you DIDNT express interest,<br>

There you have it.

Fablaar was never a member of SotE, only an applicant.  <br>

Like I said, if you kicked the guildwrecking dildo out of SOTE, then perfect. I prefer it that way either. Theres too many people in SOTE I like.<br>

However, I suggest you stop letting Krake come to Flame Central (of all places) as a public voice for your guild. He contacted me in game, telling me that Coujo instructed him to not flame here....so he contacted me in game. *sighs* If I have a problem, I'd rather be addressed by Kellek...or Coujo.

How is that low?<br>

a.) its flame central. What do you expect?<br>

c.) I cant understand a word he's saying. Im not going to pretend I can simply because he speaks broken english. I do my best, but I'm not perfect.<br>

Newp. not at all. Hutts a little more grudgemental than I am when it comes to stuff like that. I think his post was said in the heat of an angered moment. However, when an SOTE officer is openly spam recruiting from your guild, you tend to think thats what the guild represents. *I* was wrong in not coming to SOTE leadership sooner. I really should've.

Of course a guild has every right to their own recruiting business.  I tried to give some input on an applicant for FK and was politely turned away - I don't remember who it was exactly, but they were oh-so-nice in telling me it was none of my business ;-)  And now that applicant is in SotE...  Jurrassic tried warning SotE but got pretty much the same response I had.<br>

Every recruiting process I've seen so far on the Rathe seems to prefer only their own experience with the applicants.

I was also told in tells that pointing out that a post is damn near unreadable is a low blow. I thought this person was referring to a different post, but I now see which hes talking about. If you think it's a low blow, fine. Have someone that can communicate effectively represent your guild and do so outside of FC. In here though, there are no rules...Oh wait...nm, diff topic.<br>

Regarding my original post in this thread, It was directed at things that happend a short while back that I honeslty dont think all the SoTe leaders knew about at the time.
