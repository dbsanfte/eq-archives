Part One:<br>
The Betrayal<br>
<br>
        He sneaked into Greater Faydark unnoticed. A part of a contingency of guards sent to escort the Dark Elf Ambassador to the settlement of orcs on the northern border of that realm. The human shadowknight knew that he and his fellow humans were tools. They were being used by the Teir’Dal, but most of them were too young and bloodthirsty to know or care. He was different. He knew that once this “Dvinn” was installed in his position that the human escort was going to be slaughtered. They would most likely be fed to the pathetic pawns as a living goodwill gesture. <br>
<br>
        As they ran underneath the tree city of Kelethin, the knight of the dark chuckled to himself at the irony of the moment. All of us running beneath the city of druids and rangers. They claim to be so attuned to nature and yet we march directly under their noses. The fools.<br>
<br>
        At last the torches of Emperor Crush’s home came into view. The shadowknight bowed to the Ambassador and saluted the centurion that came out to greet them. “We will be returning to Freeport now.” He said to the two.<br>
<br>
        “But wait.” Dvinn bid them stay. “The other half of your payment is in the Emperor’s hands. He wishes to give you all your reward personally.” The sick, corrupt smile that slid across the Teir’Dal face almost turned the knights stomach. Had he not spent all of those tours based at the Kunark outpost hunting the abominations, the Sarnak, he might have been intimidated.<br>
<br>
        His mentor, the fallen avatar Sir Lucan, had warned the knight just before his first mission with the Dark Elves. He said, “Be wary of the Teir’Dal. Their evil is not like ours. We chose our paths with consciousness and conviction. Their evil is just not natural Their minds have been twisted more than they know by the Dark Lord, Innoruuk. They will use you until they use you up. Then they will throw you out.”<br>
<br>
        The evil elf sensed his reluctance and slithered over to his side, wrapping an arm around his shoulder as he led the men into the orc domain. “Come, Captain. We must not show any disrespect to the good Emperor. We wish to aid them in their struggle against the accursed tree-huggers.” A smile full of mirth crossed his thin blue lips then, a smile that never touched the man’s eyes.<br>
<br>
        Through the Crushbone encampment the humans were led. The knight glanced worriedly around him, finding nothing but the ugly, sneering faces of the wretched orcs. When at last they came upon the castle, there were several much larger orcs waiting for them.<br>
<br>
        Dvinn released the Captain and stepped towards the line of the orc leaders. He made a slow bow and the orcs raised themselves up in self-importance and arrogance. The Captain could see the contempt in the bow though. He knew this creature for what he truly was.<br>
<br>
        “Welcome, Dark Elf.” The orc at the center of the line began. He was somewhat shorter than the other monstrosities, but more solidly built. That must be Emperor Crush. “I trust you come in good faith?” He smiled around his yellowed fangs.<br>
<br>
        Dvinn turned to face the humans gracefully with a malicious gleam in his eyes. He began to walk around them, “Of course. We of the Indigo Brotherhood always show our goodwill.”<br>
<br>
        This set alarms off in the shadowknight’s head. He quickly began summoning his energies as he watched the orcs immediately leap in on the unsuspecting humans. They were being beaten, dragged off still screaming and praying to the Dark Lord for deliverance. He had to get away. His shadow began to elongate, and he wondered where the Ambassador was. Just as he stepped into the shadow, he felt a blade slip into his back. The pain seared in his mind, but he focused harder on his spell. He had to get away! The last thing he heard was the Ambassador gloating, “Hardly a worthy opponent.”<br>
<br>
        The shadows closed in around him and dropped him somewhere else in the camp. He was always a little disoriented after using that. This time it almost dropped him off of a cliff. He backed away from the edge, just out of sight of the hut near the bottom of the precipice, with a murky pond between the two. He dropped to the ground, bleeding badly from the knife wound in his back. The shadows of his eyelids closed in on him as his consciousness slipped away.<br>
<br>
The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Part Two:<br>
Chance Encounters<br>
<br>
<br>
        As the shadows parted the pain returned. The Captain had not expected to wake up again. He realized that he was on his side, but he had been laying on his stomach. There was a hand on his arm as well. He started to sit up, and the hand pressed down firmly but gently. The skin was soft and warm.<br>
<br>
        He maneuvered his arm free to scrub out his eyes. He discovered that his chest was bandaged tightly and the blood had stopped. He felt a warm energy rush into him and his wounds began to close on their own. <br>
<br>
        The shadowknight lifted his head to gaze into the eyes of a vision. Her auburn hair fell across graceful features, and her dark, almond shaped eyes peered into him with a strange mixture of concern and trepidation. The whole of her being seemed composed of beauty and serenity. The sun glared down so that she appeared to be wearing a halo of pure light almost as peaceful and stunning as she was.<br>
<br>
        He felt his eyes widen and he blushed. She chuckled lightly. The Captain had never imagined that a servant of Innoruuk could become enamored so quickly.<br>
<br>
        “I am called Uhrsalla Puresoul,” She smiled warmly at him.<br>
<br>
        He began sitting up slowly, felling much better as time went by. “My name is Amlik Shadowblade.” He fingered the wrappings around his chest, “I thank you for your kindness, but I am afraid that I cannot return the favor. You are a wood elf and I should most likely kill you.”<br>
<br>
        Uhrsalla shrugged, “Then I will meet the Mother of All with a clear conscience.” She studiously ignored the symbol of the Dark Lord dangling from his neck. <br>
<br>
        “How did you find me? It’s very dangerous here.” Amlik questioned.<br>
<br>
        “We came to free some of our captured countrymen. Some of them are lucky to be eaten.” She seemed on the verge of tears as if remembering a pain very close to home, a pain that would never heal.<br>
<br>
        This had been the first that Amlik had noticed the familiar sounds of battle going on around him. The races of Faydwer, the high elves, wood elves and dwarves were raiding the encampment and taking back their fellows. The companionship of the nations astounded him.<br>
<br>
The shadowknight laid a hand on his savior’s shoulder. “You do not have to tell me, but I wish to help you…” He clipped the sentence short as the word “forever” nearly escaped his lips. <br>
<br>
He grunted as Uhrsalla hugged him tightly, but oddly, it felt good. This was what he was meant for.<br>
<br>
The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Part Three:<br>
A new star in the sky<br>
<br>
<br>
        Amlik and Uhrsalla spent every moment together. The orcs in the slaver camp were never a match for either of them, but Amlik refused to venture any deeper. He told her about Dvinn, of course, but he had not told her that he wanted Dvinn to think that he had died. He was saving his strength for a time when he could exact his revenge on the treacherous Dark Elf. The hatred seethed in him, growing alongside his love for his druid savior. He pushed the hatred down though, muted it enough to marry Uhrsalla.<br>
<br>
        It was a joyous ceremony, marked with gnomish fireworks and far too much liquor. Still Amlik could not rid himself of that hate, could not allow the peace that emanated from his wife to soak into him completely.<br>
<br>
        Amlik had been sent to check on the camp of Master Wu, where reports said he had been driven off or killed by invading Teir’Dal. Their incursion worried him. It was almost like the Dark Elves were surrounding the Elven cities to catch them unaware. Sure there was the Estate of Mayong Mistmoore there, but Mistmoore’s Teir’Dal hated even their dark cousins. They were largely contained. The brownies helped make sure of that. They made travel through Lesser Faydark extremely dangerous.<br>
<br>
        He returned home to Kelethin to find his wife surrounded by several well-aged and respected druids. The women all had a somber look on their faces as they all turned to face him. His wife beamed a smile at him regardless of their reactions. He could feel the warmth in her heart radiate out to him as she lay a hand on her abdomen.<br>
<br>
        “You’re going to…” He couldn’t speak. She merely nodded. As they embraced, tears welled up in Amlik’s eyes. He was going to be a father.<br>
<br>
        Time disappeared and the pregnancy went well. Uhrsalla had never looked more beautiful to him. Soon, they had a new baby. A new baby boy.<br>
<br>
        “We’ll call him Uhrlik,” Uhrsalla panted and glowed while holding their new baby in her arms.<br>
<br>
        “It’s a fine name. And he has much of you in him. So when he’s old enough, he will take our combined surname, Pureblade.”<br>
<br>
        Amlik prayed to no one in particular for his son to have his mother’s nobility and spirit. He hoped that his son would be spared the unrelenting hate that poisoned his own heart. The once shadowknight of Innoruuk was a father now. It was difficult to adjust to that.<br>

The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Part Four:<br>
Night falls<br>
<br>
Several years passed and Uhrlik was developing well. Amlik showed him how to handle a sword, which he loved. He walked around with his small practice sword everywhere he went. He slay imaginary dragons on the way to the breakfast table in the morning, and defeated hordes of orcs alone on his way to bed at night.<br>
<br>
They could not get him to attempt magic, though. The boy should have had natural magical powers, but he refused to tap into them. Try as they might, he could not be moved. Another quality he had garnered from his mother, Amlik noted flatly.<br>
<br>
Since the boy was of mixed parentage, he found that some of the other children shied away from him. He became very introverted. Watching their son walking away from a group of children his own age because they didn’t want to play with a “half-breed” broke Uhrsalla’s heart. Amlik watched the boy clutch the sword in his little hands so tight that his knuckles turned white. He watched young Uhrlik mouth the words, “You are my real friend. You won’t desert me.” There was a strange sense of pride in that for the erstwhile shadowknight.<br>
<br>
So the boy spent his first years alone. He spent his days hunting in the woods, careful to avoid the orcs, and at night he cried while his mother sang him to sleep. One such night, Uhrsalla could take no more.<br>
<br>
“We should move away from here. Go somewhere Uhrlik will be accepted.” She whispered.<br>
<br>
Amlik considered the idea briefly, but could not think of anyplace that would be any more accepting than Kelethin. He told her so, adding, “Once he makes a name for himself, they will love him as a true Feir’Dal. You have done well with him, Heart, he is a true Good Elf.”<br>
<br>
“We have done well with him,” she corrected him as she curled up beside him.<br>
<br>
The subject was closed for that night, but it was far from forgotten. Amlik had seen much of the world in the service of the Teir’Dal. He knew that the half-elves of the world were wanderers at best. They had no society and the only way they could be accepted was to fight. They had to earn everything they got. It saddened him that he had subjected a noble spirit such as Uhrlik to this fate, but he believed that if anyone could overcome these obstacles it would be his boy. There was still that growing sense of loneliness in him though. That emptiness would be his biggest challenge, Amlik feared.<br>
<br>
The youth continued training on his own, making his best attempts to convince his parents that he was fine, that he enjoyed the solitude. He put up quite a show. Every once in a while, Amlik came around a corner just in time to see Uhrlik selling orcish weapons and armor. A mix of emotions filled him. There was pride, surely, but worry as well. He was sure that he wore the same expression now that his love had worn when she had tended his wounds so long ago.<br>
<br>
He planned on telling Uhrsalla that night as they sat down to eat dinner. Fate, it seemed, had a different plan. Explosions broke the song of the night birds, shouts from the guard outposts.<br>
<br>
“Orcs invading, to arms!” One of the ground guards shouted.<br>
<br>
Amlik rushed out the door, grabbing his sword on his way out. Uhrsalla and Uhrlik ran out behind him. The once shadowknight scanned the horizon. His eyes were no good at night. What he could see chilled him to the bone. These orcs were too organized. Their movements were too precise. This was Dvinn’s work.<br>
<br>
“You two stay here.” He ordered and stalked off. He knew that they would not obey, but he had to try.<br>
<br>
Leaping from the platform, Amlik tried to get a better fix on the enemy movements. There seemed to be nothing gained from this. Any orc that came within arm’s reach of a guard died quickly, without exception. Then it came to him. A small detachment of Legionnaires and four oracles were heading toward the massive tree trunks that held up the Tree City.<br>
<br>
At once the legionnaires turned on him. The oracles began moving into position, preparing to burn their way through the gigantic support. The orc warriors were no match for his steel, and they died quickly. Amlik rushed to find the oracles. He could hear the guards shouting for reinforcements. They had to do something to stem the tide of the misshapen beasts. Guards came leaping from their posts on top of the city, cleaving orcs as they hit the ground.<br>
<br>
Atop the city, he could see Uhrsalla’s hands burning and she pointed. Wherever her flaming hands pointed a massive explosion ripped the ground and anything else apart. Her druid sisters and brothers joined her, healing the rangers as they darted from orc to orc. The ranger blades flashed quickly and orcs died wherever they met.<br>
<br>
The blue skinned monstrosities did not stop. They kept coming like a terrible ocean. Wave after wave, all stronger and better armed than the last. It appeared that the city might not survive the night.<br>
<br>
Amlik ducked past a throng of guards slaughtering the invaders and found his quarry. The four oracles were chanting. He had caught them in the middle of casting. Reaching down as he ran, he picked up a shield and charged into them. As Amlik collided with them, the flame around their hands died. They prepared to unleash their fury on him, but he struck them down swiftly. The once shadowknight stopped for a moment, panting.<br>
<br>
Something familiar pricked the back of his mind, and his neck hairs stood up on end. Turning, an explosion illuminated the form of his nemesis: Dvinn. The slick Teir’Dal flashed his teeth at Amlik in a mock smile. The hate that had been seething inside him instantly surfaced and he rushed the Ambassador with a snarl. Dvinn merely twirled a strange black-bladed dagger in his hand and waved him on.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf parried the massive sword with ease, laughing the whole time. Amlik backed off to regroup and the sinister Ambassador nodded to him, saluted, and disappeared. The knight turned in circles looking for his dangerous prey. Things were going badly for the wood elves. The druids were running out of power to heal. Their energies were depleted. The warriors and rangers were doing their best to fight by the sides of the guards, but more seemed to be dropping every minute. The fatigue of war was setting in.<br>
<br>
Just then, Amlik felt the hair on his neck standing up again and he dodged to the side. From the corner of his eye, he saw the black bladed dagger darting past him, gleaming wetly in the firelight. He slashed to where the man had been, but found nothing there. Time after time, the twisted elf tried to pierce Amlik but found his enemy just out of reach.<br>
<br>
Anger seethed in the Teir’Dal’s blood. He became visible again, having lost his concentration. The two blades met again in a fury of blows. The hatred between the two grew until it was nearly tangible in the surrounding air.<br>
<br>
The Ambassador parried once more and hit Amlik alongside his head with the pommel of the dagger, stunning him. Dvinn laughed a maniacal laugh as he plunged the dagger into Amlik’s stomach. The poison burned into the shadowknight’s veins as he sank to his knees.<br>
<br>
“The Indigo Brotherhood always gets its way.” He laughed and turned away.<br>
<br>
“D…Dvinn…” Amlik spat weakly. The poison was working quickly. The Dark Elf turned around with a smug satisfaction on his face. “Y…You won’t get away…with this…”<br>
<br>
“But I will, and we both know it.”<br>
<br>
The shadowknight thought about his wife and son, thought about them falling into the hands of this monster, or into the cook pots like his men all those years ago. Their gnawed and meatless bones still littered the ground of Crush’s home. The desperation and hatred boiled over in him and he reached out once more to the power of the Dark Lord, Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
“You may have killed me, rogue, but my son will have my revenge. I curse you!” Striking out with all of the hate of his life he grabbed the man, draining the Ambassador in a flash of green smoke, crippling him. “You will never pose a threat again. Your fearsome powers will now only scare children. And one day, my son will find you and kill you.”<br>
<br>
Dvinn shook and sweated profusely. His power had indeed been stolen. But this man could not contain his power for long, or could he? There was no flow. He had truly been crippled. Realization of his weakness shot across his face and he retreated back to the safety of Crush’s tower.<br>
<br>
The dying knight clutched his wound tightly and convulsed in pain. He turned his eyes back to the battle and realized with horror the true purpose of the fight. He watched the pawns and centurions erecting tents and setting up camp. They had thrown themselves into the arms of death to gain a little ground on the wood elves. They were being driven back, now. The high elves had joined the battle with their paladins and powerful spellcasters. The clerics rushed through the battlefield healing the wounded and saying a prayer for the dead. The dwarves came with their powerful warriors and their own righteous knights. Dawn was coming in Greater Faydark, it seemed.<br>
<br>
“Father!” Uhrlik shouted over the din. His voice was ragged. He had been fighting. Amlik turned to face his son for the last time. The boy saw the wound and said one word, “Dvinn.”<br>
 <br>
Uhrsalla rushed up behind their son and dashed down to the ground, holding her love. She tried summoning her energies to cure the poison, but it was too late. She tried everything she could until she had no energy left. Then she cried. She held him tightly and prayed to Tunare to deliver him.<br>
<br>
Amlik laid a hand on hers and tried to silence her. He felt at peace then, felt the tranquility of her love. He let it wash over him as he slowly slipped into the night. He watched his son, with his arms bloody to his elbows and his little practice sword clutched tightly in his right hand. When did he grown so big? He asked himself absently. The young man turned to face the home of the orcs and his face grew severe.<br>
<br>
“One day I will kill you all. I will have revenge for my father.” Then he screamed with the anguish of the moment, “Do you hear me Dvinn? I am coming for you. Count on it.” He panted and said in a low voice, “I will destroy evil wherever I see it. This I promise to you, Father.”<br>
<br>
Amlik closed his eyes slowly, slipping into the night and he whispered “I love you…” Then Amlik Shadowblade, a dark knight of Innoruuk that became a hero to the wood elves; Amlik Pureblade, husband of Uhrsalla, father of Uhrlik, died.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Part Five:<br>
A Secret Revealed<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That night, Uhrlik’s father burned on a pyre next to so many others. The night was turned to day by the light of the dead. Uhrlik could not cry that night, pushing his emotions down, turning them into a ball of driving force, his own personal hatred. <br>
<br>
His mother, Uhrsalla, sang to the dead. It was a dirge that helped them find their way back to the Mother of All. What about his father, though? He had been a follower of Innoruuk. Where would he go? Certainly not to Tunare. Despite his efforts to be a loving father and husband, his hard work to keep the Faydark safe and protect the Feir’Dal, he had still been a disciple of Hate. He knew that his mother hoped she would see him in the afterlife, but Uhrlik did not think so.<br>
<br>
The answers did not come that night, but the youth watched his father’s pyre burn until the embers had cooled and the ashes were scattered on the wind. For three days he sat at the pile of scorched timbers thinking, reviewing. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The orcs had taken up residence to the north of Kelethin. The Elves and Dwarves were victorious in driving them back for the moment. There was also a rumor that the gnomes had sabotaged a Teir’Dal invasion force in Lesser Faydark that would have destroyed Felwithe, home of the High Elves. The world had changed in the course of one night. Nothing could ever be the same again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Taking up his short sword, his little practice sword, he stumbled home, exhausted and numb. He found his mother had not slept yet either, and her eyes were red and puffy from crying. He could feel her pain, feel her emptiness. She felt as if she was missing the half of herself that actually mattered to her. The boy embraced his mother, and he held her through the bone wracking sobs and fits of denial.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It took weeks for her to stop crying, but she was never right afterwards. Uhrsalla never went outside, never sang and barely spoke. She refused to eat. Like a wolf without her mate, she was slowly withering away.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik continued to hunt the orcs, this time with a new ferocity. He spent long hours on the newly usurped hill north of the city and went home late at night to care for his mother. She was pale and thin, and had recently developed a raspy cough that worried him. He cooked for her, a skill that he promised himself he would get better at one day, but she ate almost nothing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Watching his mother fading slowly away fueled the new hate within the youth. He ventured farther into the orcish encampment, slaughtering all that stood before him. He spent more and more time in the wild, unable to bear watching his mother die by inches. He joined others from the city that hunted the orcs. His reputation for killing the misshapen creatures with tireless zeal was becoming well known among the hunters. But inside the hate was growing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Soon, the young warrior was attacking Crushbone itself. He and his comrades forced their way into the quarters of the Slavers, where the ramshackle hut and the mine were littered with elves and dwarves taken prisoner in the all too common orc raids.  Rummaging through the corpse of one Slaver, Uhrlik found a key. He crept over to one of the slaves and tried the key on the poor man’s shackles. With a painfully loud CLICK the cuffs opened and the elven man was free. He spoke in hushed tones of Dvinn, warning that he had only seen the man on two or three occasions, but it was the time that he didn’t see the Ambassador that scared him. “Never turn your back on that one. And pray that you never meet him. Tunare bless you, I’m free!”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Other slaves, once freed, mentioned that Dvinn had orchestrated the mining operation. He had ordered the training of a Taskmaster. A powerful orc that could keep the other Slavers on their toes through fear, the only force that motivated the orcs aside from greed and hunger. Some of them believed that the sinister man was looking for something. A magical item or a powerful relic that his order could twist with their foul magic.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Days passed by and Uhrlik lost count of the number of slaves he returned to their families. He went into the orcish domain at sunrise every morning and staggered home with the moon over full rise. One night he was arriving home very late. The sun was rising on the horizon, turning the sky into a blazing show of color.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The young one stumbled off of the lift and began the trek to find his home while increasingly desperate for his bed. All of the guards smiled as he walked by. The same men that had shot distasteful looks at him as a child. He was very nearly home when he slammed right into the armored chest of Captain Silverwind, the captain of the Kelethin guards. Lurching backwards, trying not to fall, he focused his eyes on the captain. Silverwind smiled and salted him with the traditional warrior salute, sword over heart. Uhrlik bowed deeply and the Captain laughed and ruffled his hair.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At home, Uhrlik found his mother out of bed and clothed in the dress she had married his father in. The sun was shining brightly now and the birds were singing a lilting tune. His heart jumped into his throat and his stomach felt like it was full of ice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mother? What are you doing?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrsalla turned to her son with a wide smile on her face, “I can hear the Mother calling.” She cocked her head to the side, “Can you hear her song? It’s so beautiful.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik strained to listen, but heard nothing. “What are you talking about, Mother?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She appeared not to hear him as she lay down on her bed with her hands folded over her stomach. She eyed him for a long moment and the smile slid from her face. “You know, I worry about you.” Uhrsalla stated as she waved her son to her side.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik dashed to the stool that he kept next to her headboard and sat down, the same stool he sat on when feeding her, he noted. “Why, Mother?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have had a glimpse of your future. It troubles me greatly. I feel I must tell you before I go.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What did you see?” The boy inquired with tears in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I saw you knocking on the door to Innoruuk’s domain. I have felt the hate ebbing from you like a black sea these last months. Do not let the corruption that killed your father envelop you too. I will not be able to rest in peace knowing that you were following such a path to destruction.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Do not say such things, Mother. You will be fine. You just need to eat.” Uhrlik grasped desperately at any sense of normalcy he could find. He stood up quickly and started towards the kitchen, but Uhrsalla stopped him with a feeble hand on his wrist.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The Mother is calling me home. I have to go. I want to go. Do not turn your back on her. She loves you as her own child. She has told me this.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The young warrior sat back down slowly and lowered his head to hide the tears streaming from his eyes like rain, “I truly hope that Father is waiting on the other side for you.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrsalla smiled and closed her eyes, “I know I will see him again. I found him once after all.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And there, Uhrsalla Puresoul, faithful daughter of Tunare the Mother of All, Uhrsalla Pureblade, faithful mother of Uhrlik died.<br>
<br>

The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Part Six:<br>
Friends in Vengeance<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik did not wait for the embers of his mother’s pyre to cool. He snatched up his sword, his piecemeal armor and his meager belongings and locked the door to his house. He walked away without ever looking back.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As night rolled over the Faydark, the young warrior curled up underneath the platform of his former home. The night grew cold and Uhrlik shook in the darkness, alone and empty except for the gnawing hatred that seethed in his gut.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How could the Mother of All take his mother from him so lightly? How could he follow a goddess that could be so cavalier about death? Innoruuk was no answer either. He had taken his father away, too. There was nothing he could find in the entire pantheon of the gods to justify worship.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “My trust is in myself now,” he mumbled half asleep. “My trust is in steel.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shivering through the night, Uhrlik drifted between consciousness and deep sleep. He saw himself, only different. He wore heavy plate-like armor as mismatched as his emotions. The armor nearly glowed the magic inherent in it was so strong. A flaming reddish breastplate stood out almost as much as the weapons he wielded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In his right hand was a massive metal haft like a spear that ended in a blade crafted in the shape of a dragon’s head. In his left was a very light and obviously well made sword, the blade flaring like a leaf at the point.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a confidence and experience in the doppelganger’s eyes. He lifted his left hand and struck a massive door with the pommel of the sword. The door opened slowly and the shadows within cackled maniacally. His shadow self began to march into the door, his hate washing over the scene in bone-chilling waves. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, an army appeared at his back, as if the scene had not been complete without it. In the throng were races from all over Norrath, and they were all monstrously powerful. There were wood elves and high elves, half elves like him. Even the dreaded Iksar were there. Uhrlik felt a stab of fear as he felt the affinity that his other form had developed with the Iksar. Had he allied himself with the evil lizards? Had he seen the forbidden city of Cabilis with his own eyes?<br>
<br>
The army marched into the dark city and the doors slammed shut with a laugh that could only come from Innoruuk himself. It was filled with the embodiment of Hate. The sound like grinding bones etched itself into his memory forever. <br>
<br>
Somewhere through the night he had warmed up. He felt as if he wasn’t alone anymore. Shooting bolt upright and throwing off a blanket that hadn’t been there before, the young warrior faced a confusing scene. There was a campfire lit and rabbit was cooking on a spit over it. There was a young high elf woman sitting on the other side of the fire. She was attractive, but there was a hardness in her eyes that spoke of great pain and the desire for revenge. There was also something about her that spoke of class and distinction. Had she been a noble's daughter perhaps?<br>
<br>
The young woman looked up from the rabbit to check on him. She licked her fingers and smiled at him when she saw he was awake. “Good, I was starting to worry about you. That must have been a terrible sight to have caused you so much pain.” She saw the confusion writ strongly on his face and chuckled, “My name is Annastrianna Starflower. I am a paladin of Tunare. I found you alone and freezing out here, and something compelled me to stop. I can only imagine the Mother directed my feet this night.”<br>
<br>
“But I don’t believe in Tunare.” Uhrlik whispered absently.<br>
<br>
“Doesn’t matter. I do, and I believe she led me to you. So now I have to help you.” Annastrianna sighed. “There isn’t much I can do for you aside from the fire, food and blanket. I have an axe that I don’t use anymore, and you are welcome to it. Your strength is obviously greater than mine is so perhaps you can get better use of it than I did.”<br>
<br>
“I am grateful for any help you offer.” Uhrlik looked at the woman suspiciously. He found it hard to believe that anyone would help him without an ulterior motive. Sometimes he felt like the last soul with a shred of honor or nobility in all of Norrath.<br>
<br>
They ate in almost unbroken silence. Both stared into the fire with the same lost look on their faces. It turned out that Anna (As Uhrlik soon abbreviated her name to and much to her chagrin) had seen more of Norrath than he had. She had seen the massive continent of Antonica, while Uhrlik had never left Faydwer. He had only briefly visited the other races here. The warrior had seen the subterranean cities of Kaladim, home of the dwarves, and Ak’Anon, home of the gnomes. His time in Felwithe was short, though. They were far too puritanical for his liking. Casting sidelong glances at him when they thought he wasn’t looking. <br>
<br>
She told him stories of the Oasis of Marr and the deserts of Ro beyond the human city of Freeport. Tales of sand giants roaming the desert sands, massive tarantulas that instilled fear in the hearts of the desert beasts. She told him of men having lost their minds in the desert and wandering the sands until their death. They believed that everything was a mirage and lashed out. “The only humane thing to do,” She told him with a heavy heart, “Is to put them out of their misery.”<br>
<br>
After the fire had burned low, Uhrlik relayed his story to his new friend. “So now I am on a mission to avenge my father…and mother.”<br>
<br>
Anna nodded slowly, “The harbingers of Hate have taken much from me as well. But that is a story for another time. We should sleep now, I need to be on my way early tomorrow.”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik’s mind worked furiously that night, and sleep came in fits and spurts. Was that what his mother had seen? Was he fighting Innoruuk or was he going home to meet him?  The questions burned in his mind. Could he trust Annastrianna? He felt as if he could, but he wasn’t sure anymore.<br>
<br>
The morning came quickly and Anna was nearly ready to leave. She had donned her heavy bronze armor and was packing the rest of her gear. “Oh, before I forget,” she said as she began digging through her pack. “Take this.” The young paladin handed him an axe with a minotaur emblazoned on the shaft. It was a good weapon, with a fair balance and weight. It proved to be superior to his short sword after a few practice slashes. He thanked her heartily and thought about that blade biting into an orc, or better, Dvinn himself.<br>
<br>
“I believe we will meet again,” she started and smiled. “The Mother does not create such encounters without a plan. When you are ready to take your revenge, I will be there.” Annastrianna laughed, “Perhaps we will get strong enough to knock down the gates of Hate itself one day.” She continued laughing as she started off through the woods towards Butcher block Mountains.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik froze dead in his tracks at her statement. He began to breathe again once he could no longer hear her chuckling in the distance. He shook himself back to the moment and started off to the north for another day of scouting Crushbone castle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Part Seven:<br>
Diversions gone awry<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik spent days scouting the castle. He spent every waking moment trying to formulate a plan to get in and exact his revenge. Pushing the hate down, the young warrior tried to focus his thoughts but could not. Something was very wrong.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ducking behind a wall, Uhrlik stopped and listened inward. What he heard froze him in his tracks. Resounding in his head was the lullaby that his mother had sung to him as a child. It was the melody that had calmed his restless spirit and quieted his turbulent soul. A wave of peace washed over him, as strong and insistent as the hate that burrowed in his blood. The two clashed within him, vying for control over the destiny of the young man. His concentration shattered, the warrior ran from the domain of the orcs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His emotions raged between seething hatred and composed tranquility. There seemed to be no controlling it, no end to their struggle for his heart. Suddenly, Uhrlik heard a sound. A yell for help! One of the younger hunters must have ventured out too far.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik dashed out of the tunnel to find a young female ranger racing for the guards with three orc centurions hot on her tail. He unsheathed his axe and raced after them, shouting insults at them to make them turn. As each one did, the axe bit into them and one by one, the orcs all fell to his blade.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The young woman was very grateful, and thanked him endlessly between heaving gasps for air. As the warrior escorted the wounded girl back to the guards he felt something disturbing. The warring in his head had stopped for the moment. <br>
<br>
He had always been inclined to help people in need, even at the expense of his own safety, even at the risk of his own death. This natural sense of nobility had forced him to take action, but it was the killing of the orcs that had sated his hatred. The effect was only momentary, he found as the factions began tearing his consciousness apart again. The only way to calm his mind was to kill, but he could not bring himself to do it without honor, for the good of the Feir’Dal. Regardless of his nobility and honor though, there was still a dark part of his soul, darker even than the hate that crawled in his mind, where a new bloodlust was born.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik knew that this new confusion rending his mind would shatter any hope of getting his revenge if he could not learn to control it. He also knew that there was no way that he could focus on controlling it if he was still in the Faydark. He had to leave the forest, perhaps even leave Faydwer itself. He took a lesson from Annastrianna and began the trek to Butcher Block Mountains to take the boat over the Ocean of Tears to Freeport and the massive continent of Antonica. Maybe somewhere in the endless lands he could learn to control his mind, or at least forget himself in mindless slaughter.<br>
<br>
The boat creaked as it tumbled over the rolling whitecaps. Its masts groaned as their sails strained in the sobbing winds. Uhrlik had heard a tale that the Ocean of Tears had earned its name from a woman that lost her one true love in a vicious sea war. The woman, once she learned of his death, stole a ship and sailed into the sea he had died on and cried for a hundred years. She cried and cried until she, too, died. The story got somewhat muddled here, since no one was sure whether the crying came from her restless spirit haunting the ocean, or if the gods had heard her sobbing and instilled the very water with it to serve as a reminder of the horrors of war. Either way, the ocean had a saddening presence. The very air was oppressive. The warrior was glad to see the stone towers of Freeport coming into view.<br>
<br>
Freeport. The city his father had been born in. He never saw it again after that fateful mission. Breathing the salt air mixed with the horrid smell of the slums nearly made Uhrlik vomit. He was grateful to disembark from the boat and get his land legs back. The whole trip made him ill.<br>
<br>
He found that the guards here were no better than anywhere else when it came to half elves. They tolerated his presence, no more. He could see their shifting eyes and greedy smiles. They fingered cudgels and swords with roguish unwashed hands. These guards reeked with corruption. The Teir’Dal had a hand in this, he was sure.<br>
<br>
Regardless of the sinister guards, Uhrlik wandered the city. He listened to stories of underwater goblin cities in a far-flung corner of the continent. There were stories of fetid spiders raiding halfling lands with sadistic glee. Sometimes, it was said, if you killed one of the carrion spiders, you would find the remains of halflings. The stories ranged from the disgusting to the bizarre, but the youth listened to them all. Some he could tell immediately were complete fabrications, like the one about an ancient civil war. Humans wielding so much magical power that they created a bottomless pit that was rumored to lead to the God of Mischief’s domain. He laughed when he heard that one, but the drunkard telling the tale glared at him.<br>
<br>
Still chuckling, Uhrlik wandered some more through the streets, occasionally popping into a shop to see the wares being offered. As he wandered, he heard a man’s voice shouting and laughing.<br>
<br>
“Amlik! Amlik, is that you? Where have you been…?” The man’s question died as Uhrlik turned to face the source. A finely dressed knight, in full polished plate armor stopped a few feet from him. “I apologize, I thought you were someone else.” The knight’s tone turned sour as he turned to walk away.<br>
<br>
“How did you know Amlik?” Uhrlik asked the knight.<br>
<br>
“It has been many years since I mentored the man. I took him under my wing, once.” The man’s cold eyes warmed slightly and drew a distant cast. “My name is Sir Lucan D’Lere. I am Captain of the guards here in Freeport. Did you know Amlik, young one?”<br>
<br>
“I met the man once.” The warrior replied coldly.<br>
<br>
“On Faydwer, I presume?” Lucan eyed up the youth and dismissed the questions that were obviously burning in his mind. “No matter. I don’t suppose I need to tell you to keep your neck out of trouble here? If you aren’t careful in Freeport you might find your neck in a noose or worse.”  D’Lere’s face turned to a frigid scowl as he warned the young one. He could see the contempt in Uhrlik’s eyes, surely.<br>
<br>
It boggled Uhrlik’s mind as Lucan stalked away from him and he went on his way again. A knight that had given up everything he believed in for a scrap of power that barely extended beyond the point of his sword. His kind of authority, if it could be called that, never lasted. Tyrants like him were always put down like a rabid animal. It was said that the road to civilization was paved with the bodies of tyrants. Unfortunately, it was more frequently paved with the bodies of a tyrant’s victims first. Still, someone would come along and slay this Sir Lucan D’Lere, of that Uhrlik was sure.<br>
<br>
Wandering some more, the young one found a gate to the city. He meandered through the stone portal and the sand beyond and was glad to feel the grass under his feet. His back still itched from where the guards had been staring. They were most likely sizing him up, trying to find the best place to plant their swords.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik closed his eyes and recalled the tale that Annastrianna had told him of the oasis beyond this city. Step by step, he followed the story. He followed through the wasteland of North Ro, and at last finding the salty ocean that met the sand, he turned and followed the coast where he eventually found himself in the Oasis of Marr.<br>
<br>
There it was. The youth lumbered up the nearest dune and took in the sights of the oasis. The crocodiles that Anna had told him about crawled from the sea and roamed freely on the land. There were massive beetles and undead roaming unchecked through the sands. He could feel the hatred in those cold, lifeless eyes as they searched the sand for some respite. <br>
<br>
The hatred within pulsed in his head like a drum at the sight of the fleshless bones. One turned to face him as if Uhrlik was the embodiment of all of its torment. It cackled wildly as it charged him. Its eyes were burning maniacally as flame erupted from its hands. The skin on his arms began to smoke and smolder. Blisters opened on his cheeks as he hefted his weapons.<br>
<br>
The young warrior charged the thing with a roar of pure rage. He hacked at it with his axe and his practice sword, but found the animated bones to be far more agile than he had anticipated. It dodged and parried as it punched him with sun-hardened fists. It threw its arms wide every few seconds and new blisters and burns appeared on Uhrlik’s skin. With every punch he could feel his energy waning.<br>
<br>
As he slashed, it dodged, and the youth kicked the bleached bones with all of his might. The skeleton’s teeth ground in its hatred and it prepared to burn him again, but Uhrlik persisted in his onslaught. His axe blade caught the thing in its collarbone. Pieces of bone flew in all directions as Uhrlik used the momentum of the first swing to continue into a second. The blade bit into the long empty skull with a crunch and the bones collapsed in a heap of chips.<br>
<br>
Slowly the wounded warrior lowered himself into the sand and began to tend to his wounds. There was a salve that he had learned to apply to his bandages to cool the blisters and stop the bleeding. He was bruised and burned, but he was alive. <br>
<br>
Soon he found friends that helped him combat the dangers of the Oasis. There was a new rage in his head now, along with a new peace to war against it. His nights were spent restless at best. Nightmares haunted him with visions of the door to Innoruuk’s domain, the dark lord’s spiteful laughter echoed in his skull. This sight he had learned to expect, but now there were new visions, new horrors.<br>
<br>
He saw Crushbone castle, dilapidated and rotting. He was on the ground with Dvinn standing over him laughing. The sinister Dark Elf twirled the black bladed dagger in his right hand as he held something up in his left. No matter how many times he tried to focus on the glowing amorphous thing in the Ambassador’s left hand, the more it writhed into instability. The rage and Hate bubbled up in him so strongly that he could never see more than a few moments of that vision before they woke him up with a white knuckled snarl.<br>
<br>
The most recent vision scared him more than anything had ever scared him in his life. In the vision there was a set of eyes looking up at him. They held great wisdom, and they looked at him with adoration, complete devotion. Their shade was a blue so bright and alive that he could see his own soul in them. Every time he dreamed of them his mother’s song reverberated in every fiber of his being. Those eyes held the promise of hope, drowning his hatred and quenching his raging bloodlust. The whole of earthly emotion bowed to the love in those eyes as it echoed that in his own shadowed heart. The impossibility of this dream always made him wake weeping in the sand.<br>
<br>
The oasis was filled with cutthroat gangs and wandering ghouls, the insane men that Anna had told him about. The undead littered the desert almost as much as the breed of orcs that thrived in this hostile region. The Deathfist orcs, a rusty green rather than the sickly blue of their cousins on Faydwer, traveled a beaten sand road between two of their numerous camps so constantly that it was termed “the orc highway”. They wandered the desert preying on the weak and wounded, they grouped together with more ferocity and efficiency than their smaller cousins did. Even the cutthroat gangs traded with them and admitted some of the more clever of the breed into the gangs.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik and his friends had just finished clearing a camp of cutthroats when one of the friends mentioned a familiar name. “Annastrianna? You know her?” he asked the bronze-clad paladin as he removed the blade of a jagged sword he had recently purchased from the back of a female ogre. <br>
<br>
“Aye,” he replied. “She mentioned you to me as well. She told me to come find you and tell you that she will be waiting for you at the Estate of Unrest on Faydwer.”<br>
<br>
The young one thought for a moment. “I will have to seek her out soon,” he took out a cloth and wiped the blade clean before sheathing it. “But I am not ready to seek my revenge yet. I am not strong enough yet, and I do not possess enough control.” The last he admitted grudgingly.<br>
<br>
As the last of his words left his mouth, the group was suddenly beset by two of the wandering ghouls. They howled and shrieked in their strange language as they slashed at the group with their fetid claws. They were strong, and the situation was dire, but the group acted quickly and set themselves in their positions. Uhrlik laughed and swore at the ghouls, causing them to forget about the rogue that quietly slipped behind them. The cleric began to cast a spell to force the restless spirits back into their graves.<br>
<br>
The paladin, Baldaranian, hacked away at the ghouls while Uhrlik’s blades flashed through their rubbery flesh. The rogue, a massive barbarian that they had picked up along the way, smiled as he punched his harpoon into the back of one ghoul. He chuckled with glee as he watched it drop. The other ghoul turned and began rending the barbarian with a sickening fervor.<br>
<br>
After one slash the rogue’s arm began to turn a pale yellow and he started foaming at the mouth. The ghoul attacked him relentlessly and the cleric fell to the ground exhausted moments before the sly barbarian fell lifeless to the ground. The ghoul turned on the cleric next, but Uhrlik stepped in the way. He forced the thing to vent its fury on him instead. He could not allow another member of his raiding party to die by this abomination.<br>
<br>
He could see it was starting to weaken, but he was unexpectedly left alone to fight it. Baldaranian shouted to him from several paces away, “Run! There’s a sand giant coming this way. You’ll never finish the ghoul in time to escape it!”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik could not escape though, and he knew it. He would have to fight on so that his friends could get to safety. He forced Baldaranian to run regardless of him and fought on. He was getting weak, but the ghoul was nearly finished. Then the head of the giant came into view.<br>
<br>
The giant sneered down at Uhrlik with cracked, yellowing teeth. He had an unwashed face and a dirty whitish cap upon his head. He laughed and charged after the young fighter. <br>
<br>
The ghoul fell limp to the ground as Uhrlik finished it and he ran as fast as he could, already weakened and bloody. The giant caught up quickly and bashed him with a mighty fist. The breath rushed out of Uhrlik’s lungs and he gasped desperately for air as he continued to run. He dodged over the dunes with the giant on his heels. Abruptly the adolescent fighter tumbled down a dune and fell unconscious under the sand.<br>
<br>
When he awoke, there was a rusty green orc standing over him. His heart leaped into his chest and he tried to scurry away. The orc merely cocked his head to the side and extended a hand.<br>
<br>
Reluctantly, Uhrlik took the orcs hand, raising slowly to his feet. He found that he had been bandaged while he was insensate. A groan escaped him uncontrollably as he stood uneasily.<br>
<br>
“Few run from Giants and live,” the orc spoke fluently, not like the halting orc speech one could expect from a normal orc, as if they had learned the common tongue only recently. “I am Ortallius. I am not like other orcs. Rathmana saved me from the Dervish Cutthroats as a baby. Now I serve the Temple of Solusek Ro. I believe I can help you.”<br>
<br>
“How can you help me? I mean, other than what you have done for me already.” He clumsily fingered the wrappings over his wounds.<br>
<br>
“My emotions flare wildly because I am an orc. I once had to learn control over them, as you need to learn it now. Your nobility and honor is not enough. The hate and rage will destroy you.” Ortallius stated sadly.<br>
<br>
“Will you teach me?” Uhrlik asked hopefully.<br>
<br>
Ortallius nodded silently for a moment, then looked down at the young one and said, “It will not be easy, it never is. But I believe you can do it. Even if you hold no godly allegiance.” The last the orc mumbled apprehensively.<br>
<br>
So Uhrlik began to learn from Ortallius. The orc taught him to identify the feelings behind his actions. “This will unite you within.” He frowned, showing a great pain inside, one he reserved for himself alone.  “But it will not make you whole. I cannot teach you anything to fill that void, as I have never filled my own.” <br>
<br>
Some days later, the young warrior was ready to seek out Annastrianna at the Estate of Unrest. He had learned all that he could from the reformed orc. He found the rage that the Hate had given birth to danced with the peace of his mother’s Calm. Like some twisted opera they played on inside his head, and he – the poor player on the stage – choreographed his movements to their symphony.<br>
<br>
Soon, the Oasis was behind him as he made his way back to his home, made his way toward his revenge.<br>

<br>
The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Part Eight:<br>
The Rebirth of Hate<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sand gave way to grass, which in turn gave way to the sand again as Uhrlik strode through the gates of Freeport once more. He hoped that the wait for the boat would not be long. Just as he had the first time coming through the town, the youth was soon hopelessly lost. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hey boy,” A familiar voice laughed. “I figured out why you remind me so much of Amlik.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His stomach turned to ice as Uhrlik turned to face Sir Lucan again, “Oh?” He asked dispassionately. “Do tell.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You’re his son, aren’t you?” The look on Uhrlik’s face must have given him away, as Lucan continued. “Ha! I knew it! And you’re a half elf to boot. I wonder what Elven bitch your father ravished to sire you!” The once paladin doubled over in laughter.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rage burst out of control. “You know nothing of my mother.” The hate writhed in his veins as Lucan merely laughed harder. He was holding his side now he guffawed so hard. “Apparently you know nothing of my father, either.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lucan stopped laughing instantly, “And what do you mean by that, little half breed?” Growing more and more angry, he stalked after the boy as Uhrlik backed away from him. “I taught your father everything he knew. I was the one that got him that last assignment before his regiment disappeared. The Indigo Brotherhood has sent word all the way to the Kunark outpost to watch for any of them, and to kill them on sight.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik shook his head and continued to back away. “You still don’t get it, do you? Amlik Shadowblade got married to a wood elf, my mother. He became a legend to the Feir’Dal. He did everything he could to stop the Teir’Dal invasion of Faydwer.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So where is this legend now?” Lucan hissed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “He’s dead.” Uhrlik gnashed his teeth. “He died because of you for teaching him. He died because you volunteered him to be a sacrificial lamb.” Lucan looked dumbstruck. “That’s right, the bones of his men litter the Crushbone encampment. He was the only one to survive that encounter, and the Dark Elf he brought there organized the orcs for the sole purpose of killing my father. So now I hold you responsible for my father’s death.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “And what do you propose to do about it, boy?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nothing… yet.” The young warrior glared threateningly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t suppose your legendary father told you about his other missions in the service of Innoruuk, did he?” Lucan was obviously shaken by the news of Amlik’s death, and perhaps a bit remorseful for his involvement in it. He was hurt by Uhrlik’s words, now he had to hurt him back. “Did he tell you about the mission where he posed as a guard of Qeynos to corrupt the guards there? A mission that went very well, I might add. I bet he didn’t tell you about the high elven bitch that he took as a mistress there. Or about the child that was born of their union.” Lucan straightened when he saw the shock on Uhrlik’s face. He was satisfied with the results, casting a shadow on the perfect father’s memory. “No. I didn’t think so. He refused to care for the child, and the woman would have been outcast for having a half elf child, so she left it, I believe, on the steps of a Tunarean temple.” Lucan sighed whimsically, confident in crushing this child’s heart. “I wonder what ever happened to the boy.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I see you’re exerting your true power again, Lucan.” A voice called out dubiously from behind Uhrlik. “Picking on children, I see.” Another knight stood firmly with his sword bared, its point in the dirt. He was also dressed in polished plate armor but wearing a different livery on his tunic. There was something about this knight that was different from the shifty eyed, slimy guards that infested the rest of Freeport, and he obviously did not like Sir Lucan D’Lere.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “This is none of your concern, Valeron. The boy and I have some business to tend to.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The man shook his head and the patch over one war-lost eye gave the action even more gravity. “You will leave the boy alone. You may control the rest of Freeport with that disease you call a militia, but we control this part. You will leave North Freeport now or you will leave here in pieces.” Valeron lifted his sword and stood ready.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lucan snarled and backed away, sheathing his own sword. “We will meet again, boy.” Turning on his heels he walked away with his back straight and his head high.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik bowed deeply to the knight, “Thank you. I am not sure that I would have survived that encounter. My name is Uhrlik Pureblade.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The knight did not take his eyes from Lucan’s back until he was well out of sight. “I am Valeron Dushire and what I did, I did not do for you.” Valeron glanced at the boy and sighed, seeing the confusion on his face. He took on a lecturing tone and continued. “I lead the Knights of Truth, the Order that monster has forsaken for the promise of a scrap of power. He corrupts our children and tarnishes the name of Freeport.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So why don’t you just kill him?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The knight eyed Uhrlik askance with a look that said he had thought of it before, “The ways of our Order are not discussed so openly, especially not with one such as you. Now, please go in peace.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “One such as me?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes,” Valeron growled. “One that owes no holy allegiance, one that is not from our Order, or any Order for that matter. You are a drifter, a ruffian in the eyes of the Knights of Truth. We allow your presence here, and we will protect you should you deserve it, but we will not dispense our secrets to a thug and mercenary. Now good day, child. May the Lightbringer illuminate your way.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik took the dismissal for what it was and wandered back through the city, ever watchful for Lucan around every corner. He stopped occasionally for directions to the port, but few people deigned to stop for him. Those that did thought him a beggar and refused to answer any questions. He eventually found the port and the boat was just arriving. The youth noted that even though he may seem like a drifter and a mercenary, he was far more than that. He was a boy with a dark destiny, and while his heart was not as pure as his steel, he would always try to live up to his mother’s nobility and his father’s honor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a new hate breeding in his heart now. It mingled with the hatred for Dvinn. Uhrlik wondered whether killing Dvinn, the tool of his parent’s demise, would be enough to satisfy the hatred that seized his heart. The crying of the ocean offered no opinions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Part Nine:<br>
Counseling Caution<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Far to the south of Kaladim, buried in the Butcher Block Mountains, lay the entrance to Dagnor’s Cauldron. A mangled landscape bereft of life, the Cauldron was littered with jagged peaks and towering stone spires. The sun never shone here, and it rained almost constantly. An explosion of immense magnitude created the Cauldron, but the origins of the explosion escaped history. Its origins are not without their own fairy tales, however.<br>
<br>
There was one such tale that told of a great war against the Kedge, an ancient aquatic race that was thought to have disappeared from the world eons ago. It was said that the Kedge city extended the entire length of a pristine lake, its golden towers shimmering in the sunlight where they rose majestically out of the water. The Kedge were fiercely isolationist people, resenting any invasion of their lands and waters, including the estate of the dwarven noble built high on a hill overlooking the lake. <br>
<br>
The origin of the war against the Kedge is unclear, but it was generally believed that they attacked the noble’s estate, and the noble brought his political and military power to bear. The noble, the story went, brought a wizard of unsurpassed skill to put an end to the bloody war. The wizard, whose name also eluded the ages, brought down a hail of fire followed by a stone from space that was the size of an island. The rock slammed into the golden city, evaporating most of it and burying the rest. One small portion of the city survived the ordeal, underneath the newly created mountains. The surviving Kedge thrived here in their blessed isolation, their church of Prexus intact, for ages until recently rediscovered by some of the boldest adventurers.<br>
<br>
The detonation was so powerful that it completely upset the balance of the gods in the region, and one of the most foul deities reached down and snatched the lives of the inhabitants of the noble’s estate. Their minds were twisted to the point that they forgot what life had been like, feeling nothing but the torment of undeath and the desire to share that torment for a moment’s relief. Even the animals were changed into foul, aggressive beasts bent on the destruction of all living beings that invaded their domain.<br>
<br>
The god made its curse more horrid by cloaking the entire estate in eternal night. The undead roamed the grounds freely, trapped in their pain, but unable to step foot from the estate. This was exactly the kind of place that Uhrlik expected to find Annastrianna.<br>
<br>
Upon entering the tunnel, Uhrlik found several people crouching against the stone walls. There was a cleric of Tunare passing through the group healing as she went. Her eyes were sunken and heavy with exhaustion, but she continued with her duty. Uhrlik stopped and dug his bandages out of his pack and began binding the worst of the wounds until the cleric could regain enough strength to cure them further.<br>
<br>
“Be careful if you’re going in there,” a young wood elf druidess warned him. “Those creatures swarm.”<br>
<br>
“Aye,” a female half elf agreed gravely. She had been bandaging herself and several of her compatriots, but turned her attention to him briefly. “They attack in groups, as if they’re social in some way. And there always seems to be more of them, like they aren’t allowed to stay dead.” She shuddered uncontrollably then. Uhrlik noted that the bronze armor that this woman wore very nearly matched his own, and the giant two-handed sword at her side marked her as a warrior like himself. He chuckled slightly to himself that they looked like two Great Oranges of War.<br>
<br>
“I thank you for the advice.” He bowed slightly. “I’m looking for someone, she said she would meet me at this accursed place. Perhaps you know of Annastrianna?”<br>
<br>
The druidess and the warrior woman both nodded and exchanged glances. “And you are?” The druidess asked.<br>
<br>
“My name is…”<br>
<br>
“Wait. You’re Uhrlik, right? The druidess smiled. “I hunted with you in the Crushbone encampment.”<br>
<br>
“Amarante?” Uhrlik squinted and stepped slowly towards the girl.<br>
<br>
“Yes.” She laughed, “And the grump over there is Dauphine.” The warrior woman looked incredulous but the young nature walker went on, “It’s been a long time. I trust you’ve been well?”<br>
<br>
“It’s been hard without someone there to keep me out of trouble,” The young warrior winked and continued, “Where is Anna?”<br>
<br>
“Anna? Oh you mean Annastrianna. She’s still inside. I believe she’s at the fountains. Head straight in, follow the tunnel and you can’t miss the fountains.”<br>
<br>
“I thank you.” Uhrlik bowed. “It was good to see you again, Amarante, and it was nice to meet you Dauphine.”<br>
<br>
The warrior dashed down the long tunnel until it opened into a spacious estate. The grounds hinted at having once been well tended, with lush greenery and precisely cut paving stones. The fountains sat along the path that eventually led to the manor, slick and stagnant water festering in their pools. There were two cultured labyrinths dominating the sides of the walkway, their once carefully tailored leaves now sprouting cruelly barbed thorns. <br>
<br>
While he waited at the fountains, Uhrlik listened to the sounds of unrest. The shrieks of pain, the howling of eternal torment rending the stale air. The cacophony of affliction blended together like a tragic opera. Great people had been driven from this estate screaming, gripping to the last shreds of their sanity. Others had been made fully mad. Unrest was hardly the place to be if you were unsure of yourself or your skills, and those skills it forged in the fire of relentless combat.<br>
<br>
At long last, Annastrianna walked down the path from the manor with a smile on her face. She wore an old and well-used breastplate that looked quite sturdy despite its dusty appearance. The sword in her hand glowed slightly as if it defied the darkness of the accursed place.<br>
<br>
“I knew you’d get here sooner or later.” Anna chuckled. “You’re nearly ready to seek your revenge, aren’t you?”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik nodded, “I have learned a modicum of control, and I must put the hate to rest. Or at least, I must put that hate to rest.” He added, thinking of Lucan.<br>
<br>
“As I said before, when you are ready to go I will be there. Just ask.” She saluted him briefly and turned to face a howling ghoul creeping down the path towards them. “Shall we?”<br>
<br>
“Indeed.” The young warrior smiled, “I have to hone my senses as much as my skills, and what better place than this?” Weapons bared, he joined Annastrianna in slaughtering the denizens of Unrest.<br>
<br>
For weeks, Uhrlik fought against the undead tide. He joined forces with Amarante and Dauphine constantly, and other hunters as they came. Frequently they were overwhelmed, rushing for the tunnel for the safety of the open air. Uhrlik escaped bloodied and broken because it was not in him to turn and run. He could not allow any that hunted with him to come to harm while he had an ounce of energy left in him.<br>
<br>
The legends proved true about nothing that had lived on the estate had gone uncorrupted except for one thing: Death Beetles. Uhrlik could not figure out the relationship between the place and the beetles. Had the beetles been there before the war? Were these beetles just twisted representations of what they had been, like the rest of the estate? Were they drawn here because of all the rotting, fetid corpses? Were they like the Crushbone slavers? Did they serve as slave drivers, tormenting the souls of those imprisoned here, or were they nothing more than giant parasites feeding on the ample supply of dead and dying flesh? Whatever the case, they were as twisted and swarmed as aggressively as the corpses themselves. <br>
<br>
One day, Uhrlik was hunting with Amarante and Dauphine, and they met up with Annastrianna inside the manor. The mansion was worn and decaying, its furniture was ransacked and cobwebbed, though the warrior had never seen a spider here.<br>
<br>
They had just slain the last of the skeletons in what had been a large ballroom, its chandelier still hanging over the harlequin floor tiles. The fires still burned in one of the dead dancer’s eye sockets as the four turned their attention to the stairs at one end of the room.<br>
<br>
Annastrianna looked them over and said, “You three stay here, I’m going to look for something upstairs.” They nodded and she dashed up the right staircase.<br>
<br>
Moments later, Anna rushed back into the room, leaping over the small railing on the stairs, “Stand ready! I do not know what just attacked me, but I can feel my skin burning from within.”<br>
<br>
A skeleton rushed down the stairs with rigid inefficiency, straight for Anna. It bashed her as the two warriors joined the fray. Soon after, a black clad gnome strode down the stairs. He was pale and sickly looking, but there was an aura of power about him. He sneered as he looked over the group, “You three I might have forgiven for interrupting my studies, but this paladin,” he said with acid on his tongue as he eyed Anna, “must be destroyed. I cannot stand your type. So mighty, so righteous you make me sick.”<br>
<br>
“Who are you?” Amarante asked as she healed Anna again. She was growing weary, and it was showing.<br>
<br>
“My name is Khrix Fritchoff, and I’m conducting very important work here.” The gnome saw Amarante healing Anna and his face turned even more sour. “I see. If that’s the way you want it…”<br>
<br>
His attack was quick, a burst of flame around his hands and Amarante dropped to the ground. Her veins started turning blue as a poison raged under her skin. “Get her out of here!” Uhrlik shouted at Dauphine, who swiftly snatched the young druid over her shoulder and ran for the tunnel.<br>
<br>
Anna slashed the skeleton once again and it shattered into pieces. The gnome turned his attention on her as he had been eyeing Uhrlik after Amarante was evacuated. His fists turned into a blur as he punched the two mercilessly. They did their best to parry the blows, but the gnome was far stronger than he appeared.<br>
<br>
“You interest me, Warrior.” The little man stated as he focused his assault on Annastrianna. “I can feel an immense hatred brewing in you. It’s the thing that motivates your every action, the rage behind every kill. You try to convince yourself that you’re doing Norrath a service, that you’re being as righteous as this one,” he spat at Anna. “But in your heart you know the truth.”<br>
<br>
“We must get out of here, now!” Anna panted at Uhrlik. They were both wearing down, and his punches were having a harder effect now.<br>
<br>
The warrior nodded and they ran from the ballroom, out of the mansion, with the gnome directly behind them. He stopped as they ran breathlessly down the path to the tunnel, and he shouted to Uhrlik, “How can you kill the one responsible without becoming exactly what you strive to destroy? How do you get revenge on a monster without becoming a monster yourself?” Khrix laughed heartily at the conundrum. “This is my gift to you, little one. Learn well from my words.” The necromancer turned to go back into the dark recesses of the manor, still chuckling to himself.<br>
<br>
The words burned into Uhrlik’s mind like a brand. Amarante was resting comfortably, having cured her poison. The young one tended his own wounds mechanically. How could he kill a monster without becoming one himself?<br>

<br>
The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Part ten:<br>
The Blood of Innocence<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The necromancer’s words still troubled him. There seemed to be no way of getting his revenge without becoming a monster on some level. Like the riddles his father told him when he was a child, this seemed to be a question without an answer.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You look troubled, Uhrlik.” Anna whispered. Amarante still slept, but it was hardly a sound sleep. “Do not let the words of that crazed gnome get to you…”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik cut her off, “He’s right and we both know it.” Thoughts rushed through his head and his emotions were flaring. The rage and the song clashed together like oceans at war. “I have to go. I need to be alone.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You’re going to do it now, aren’t you?” Dauphine asked. “You’re going to seek your revenge in this state?” She shook her head. “I do not think that is wise.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The young warrior stood up and started down the tunnel towards Dagnor’s Cauldron, “Never let it be said that I was wise.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “May Tunare guide you this day, friend.” Anna bowed and sat down to meditate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dauphine still shook her head at the haste of his decision. Finally she harrumphed and said, “Fight well, we shall meet again.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Tell Amarante goodbye for me.” Uhrlik bowed and ran from the tunnel.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Loping over the blasted landscape, the warrior tried to block out all thought, all emotion. He needed to focus in this hour of his revenge. By the time he reached the pass to the Butcher Block Mountains only the Rage and the Song remained. <br>
<br>
By the time he reached the orc hill in Greater Faydark, his mind was like the blades he clutched in his fists, hardened steel and razor sharp. The little pawns and centurions sent to guard the hill cowered as he ran by them. They knew that they could not stop him and wisely stepped aside. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the Crushbone encampment, the orcs shivered as he ran by them. Only the legionnaires rushed him, shouting, “Your deeds are an affront to all I believe.” Or, “I shall rid the land of another infamous villain. You are no match for a legionnaire.” He had to smile at that.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At last the castle stood before him. It no longer seemed as ominous as it was once. There was a group of hunters preparing for an assault on the castle throne room, and seeing him rush the door, they followed quickly behind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The guards at the door died swiftly. They tried to run, but the warrior would not allow any to escape his vengeance. The group followed him into the throne room and immediately set to destroying the legionnaires within.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Time to die, Uhrlik.” A guttural orcish voice grunted.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The warrior turned just in time to parry the axe of the infamous Lord Darish, Emperor Crush’s younger brother. There was a bloodlust in Darish’s eyes as he lunged forward, pressing his attack. <br>
<br>
Uhrlik returned the attack and swiftly brought the orc on the defensive. Within moments, Uhrlik slashed through the orc’s defenses and his jagged sword blade sliced his foe open, mortally wounding him. Darish sank to the ground, whimpering as he died.<br>
<br>
Looking around, the warrior saw that the younger hunters had done well in taking the throne room. It was empty except for the last oracle, which they were engaging now. Again he smiled, the new hunters were getting bolder. The Crushbone empire would never extend into the Faydark while hunters such as these lived there.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik peered behind the throne and started up the steps to Crush’s tower. That would be Dvinn’s hiding place, he was sure of it. The rage was growing loud in his head as it thundered through his veins. He could feel his vengeance close at hand.<br>
<br>
In the tower, the Emperor was nowhere to be seen, but there was his quarry. The Ambassador stood looking out the window at the dig site across from the moat. He twirled the strange black bladed dagger in his right hand as he scratched his chin unconsciously with his left.<br>
<br>
The warrior crept up behind the Dark Elf as if to take him by surprise. Dvinn’s ear twitched suddenly, and he whirled around with amazing speed. The dagger thrust out with precision, just missing Uhrlik’s chest.<br>
<br>
“I remember you.” Dvinn laughed. “You’re that pathetic shadowknight’s son. It’s been a long time. How is your mother?” He sneered as if he already knew the answer.<br>
<br>
“She is dead and you are going to pay.” Uhrlik stated blandly as their blades met again and again.<br>
<br>
“And you’re going to be the one to kill me? Where others, much greater in strength than you I might add, could not. I highly doubt it.” The sneaky Teir’Dal ducked behind Uhrlik and kicked him with all of his might, sending the warrior out the tower window.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik crashed hard on the hard ground, flat on his back. He tried to get up but was horribly out of breath. He watched as Dvinn leaped from the window and stood over him, straddling him. Dvinn laughed mercilessly at the fallen warrior, and his laugh was like slime coating slime. It was a viscous, oily laugh that made him want to retch listening to it. <br>
<br>
He could not believe that his path had come to this. His planning and contemplation, all to die by the hand that had killed his parents. It made him want to weep as he saw the dagger rising above his chest. He had failed his parents, failed everyone that had ever died in this monster’s path. How many had he killed? How many innocents had fallen along this man’s way? And here he lay, breathless and weak, unable to do anything about it.<br>
<br>
“I’ve found something!” An elven slave shouted from the dig site.<br>
<br>
Dvinn shot a look over to the slaver nearest him. “Check it out, you fool!” The demented rogue nearly salivated with anticipation.<br>
<br>
“You have found nothing, slave.” The orc spat.<br>
<br>
“Then kill him.” Dvinn shouted. “I will not have this operation compromised because the slaves won’t accept what they are. Make an example of him.”<br>
<br>
It was all Uhrlik needed to gather his strength back. His breath came back and he heaved his heavily armored foot up into Dvinn’s back. Something crunched as his foot hit squarely in the man’s ribs. Dvinn staggered forward and Uhrlik stood up with his blades ready. He thought of all the people the man had killed before. Of all the people…<br>
<br>
From the corner of his eye, Uhrlik saw the other slaves raising their mining picks and squaring off against the slaver. He didn’t like his odds anymore.<br>
<br>
Dvinn stood before him, dagger at the ready. “Why don’t you just lay down and die? I promise I’ll make it quick for you. Not painless,” he laughed, “but quick.”<br>
<br>
“I can’t let you harm anyone else.” The youth dashed forward slashing at the sinister Ambassador. “You see, I’ve finally figured out the answer to the riddle.” His mother’s song reverberated in his ears so loudly that he thought that the world must be hearing it now as well, but the rage was nowhere to be found.<br>
<br>
“What riddle, boy?” Dvinn attacked the warrior again, kicking and bashing where his slick, poisoned dagger could not penetrate.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik slashed the Ambassador’s long coat open across the chest, revealing the dark blue skin beneath. A long red line opened on the man’s chest, and he began to bleed like a crimson waterfall. “I could not get revenge on you without becoming a monster myself.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed.” The monster sneered. “So then you’ve accepted your fate? You will become a monster to destroy me?”<br>
<br>
The two circled around each other, panting with exhaustion. They were both bleeding in a dozen places or more. They were bruised and breathless from the intense fighting, but they held their weapons with skill and readiness. Both were determined that this would be a fight to the death.<br>
<br>
Just then, a bluish aura surrounded Uhrlik. His wounds began to close and he felt revitalized. As they circled, Uhrlik saw a human, slightly older than himself with a patch over one eye. The man wore a symbol of Tunare around his neck and was casting his healing on the wounded warrior.<br>
<br>
“I have paid for your death with the blood of innocence, but I will not be what you are. I was blind to not see it before. You have killed too many people, and for that you must pay. This is not about revenge anymore.” He slashed furiously into the elf’s defenses, meeting with a waning resistance.<br>
<br>
“Then what is this, whelp?”<br>
<br>
“This is Justice.” Uhrlik made a final thrust with his sword, punching through the other man’s coat, the jagged blade running straight through Dvinn’s black heart.<br>
<br>
There, the Ambassador that had slaughtered countless people in search of an ancient artifact, the assassin that had enslaved an empire and murdered the dreams of a young boy, there Dvinn died.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik bowed to the cleric that had just saved him. “I thank you. You were just in time, I think.”<br>
<br>
“I heard the calling of the Mother. She told me to tell you that even though you have forsaken her, she has not forsaken you. My name is Brenidil Gentlehands, and I have some friends I think you should meet…”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Story of Uhrlik<br>
Epilogue<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So Uhrlik dispensed justice on the dark elf Ambassador Dvinn. Thus quieting the memories of his parents and allowing countless spirits to rest in peace. The accursed Hatred that infected Uhrlik’s blood did not dissipate with the slaying of Dvinn. He suspected that it would not until he stormed the gates of Hate and destroyed Innoruuk himself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He spoke at length with Brenidil about these friends. They turned out to be a guild, a collection of noble spirits like him that would welcome him with open arms. It was the guild that he would soon join, The Feir’Dal, The Good Elves. In Feir’Dal he found a home at long last. He found friends. Eventually, he would find a wife and lose a brother.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There were many stories in Uhrlik’s life that took place before, during and after his search for vengeance. There were friends along the way that were not present within these meager pages. There were stories that shaped his life and the face of Norrath forever. Those, however, are stories for another time…<br>

I am currently writing yet another chapter to this story. There are several chapters that have not been published here on NT yet, but exist on the Feir'Dal guild board (Haven't gotten around to posting them here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
While killing Inny would be the culmination of Uhrlik's search, he has not as yet been part of a raid that took out the big pickle. All of the previous chapters are somewhat dramatized versions of what has actually happened to Uhrlik in his misadventures through Norrath, so I can't just say that he soloed Inny and whooped his leathery butt.<br>
<br>
However, if anyone's offering to take me along when they kill Inny just so I can write about it I'm game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Uhrlik Mystblade<BR>

<br>
The Story of Uhrlik<br>
The whole of earthly emotion<br>
<br>
Uhrlik had spent much time on the lost continent of Kunark. He had slain the vicious Sarnak in the Lake of Ill Omen; he had teamed up with Amarante again to slay giants in the Frontier Mountains. He even went to the Overthere to combat the powerful creatures there, but he left soon after finding that the Dragoons in the outpost there had a particular hatred for him.<br>
<br>
His “little sister” had sent him a message that she missed him and needed to see him about a matter of some importance. Kinluianae was not his real sister, but he protected her like a big brother, and when she said as much, they just took it to heart.<br>
<br>
So he boarded the Maiden’s Voyage, that vast ship with its calico sails billowing in the wind like gossamer butterfly wings. The ship sailed through the dragon-infested waters known as Timorous Deep. Waters that he had swum once, but that was a story all to itself. The warrior was going home again, back to Kelethin.<br>
<br>
The ship cut through the water with a lazy grace. It lolled through the waves with amazing speed, but made painfully slow turns. Such a massive craft could not turn with any speed, but it certainly tried to. All aboard kept a watchful eye, waiting for any sign of the fish-dragon Faydedar. It was not entirely unknown for him to attack the boat and devour the passengers. This trip went uneventfully, and Uhrlik sighed in relief when he boarded the shuttles to take him the rest of the way to the docks in the Butcher Block Mountains. <br>
<br>
When at last he caught up with Kinluianae, the young druidess was tending wounds at the orc lift underneath Kelethin in Greater Faydark. She appeared haggard, but somehow wiser than he had left her. She seemed to have been exhausting her energies so that others could continue the fight for orc hill. That was always her way, though. She was selfless in the face of combat.<br>
<br>
She finished with her last patient and look up, weary and tired, and her eyes found his. Her face brightened as she rushed over to Uhrlik and hugged him painfully tight. “Brother I’ve missed you. We need to talk.”<br>
<br>
“About what?” Uhrlik asked in a wheezing gasp. The girl was stronger than she looked.<br>
<br>
“We need to talk about what I saw at that party last week. You know what I’m talking about.”<br>
<br>
Indeed he did. <br>
<br>
It was a loud party, with alcohol flowing freely. His guild mates were all around him, as was his sister. Kin, as he called her, loved parties. She danced away from his side to the music of a bard and joined with the shuffling throng. <br>
<br>
Uhrlik watched her dance for a while, to make sure she was safe. Something was not right inside him. He felt nervous without a reason, and his stomach felt as if it were a pit of ice. His mother’s song blared in his head, growing louder and louder. <br>
<br>
“She dances well for one so young.” A woman’s sultry voice said from his side.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik turned to face the dream that had haunted his nightmares since he first heard the Song. The blue eyes so bright and alive that he could see his own soul in them stared into his so intently that he began to squirm unconsciously.<br>
<br>
“She’s my… uh…sister, sort of.” He mumbled to her.<br>
<br>
The woman nodded, “I thought as much.” Her head cocked to the side slightly. “You remember me, don’t you?”<br>
<br>
“You’re Lamila, the leader of Feir’Dal, my home and sanctuary.” Uhrlik answered in a rush.<br>
<br>
“But you stare at me as if you’ve never seen me before. Did I suddenly grow a third eye that everyone is too polite to tell me about?”<br>
<br>
The warrior gasped and tried to laugh at the same time and his words came out in a spluttering cough, “No, no. I’ve… never been… this close to you.”<br>
<br>
She laughed, “So then I’m either hideous or I smell bad.”<br>
<br>
“No, just the opposite. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on.” He realized what he had said and he blushed profusely. He scanned the crowd to find some way out of the mess his tongue was making, but found only Kin staring at him intently and smiling widely.<br>
<br>
Lamila blushed, “Why thank you. I suppose you’re attractive underneath that silly helmet.” The druidess began removing his helmet and he backed away swiftly when her fingers grazed his cheek. The simple touch sent shocks through his entire body. <br>
<br>
Uhrlik shook himself back to the moment, “Sorry, what were you saying, Kin?”<br>
<br>
Kin threw her hands up in the air, “Ugh. Mother, give me strength.” She chuckled at him and continued, “I was saying you love her. I know it and you know it. I’d be surprised if she doesn’t know it. I’m sure she loves you, too.”<br>
<br>
The warrior blushed again, “You really think so?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, now stop blushing whenever I mention her. You’re a warrior for crying out loud. Aren’t you supposed to be a rough and tumble type?”<br>
<br>
“Sorry, I will try.”<br>
<br>
“You should know that I have been talking to her as well. Acting like your ambassador in a way.”<br>
<br>
“You haven’t?” Uhrlik shouted in terror.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I have.” She smiled mischievously. “She blushes every time I mention you to her. I suppose that’s a good sign. Either she loves you or she gets sick whenever she thinks of you.” Kinluianae laughed heartily at Uhrlik’s wide-eyed gape. “I’m kidding, really.”<br>
<br>
“That isn’t funny.”<br>
<br>
“Sure it is.” Kin pointed out, “You used to tease me mercilessly, and this is the only thing I can use to get you back. But seriously, she does love you and you love her, so have at it. Go get the woman. Make her yours forever.”<br>
<br>
“Gee, is that all?” Uhrlik shook his head as he weighed the enormity of the task in his head, still reeling from the news that Lamila was in love with him, too. “How exactly do I win the Great Lamila’s heart?”<br>
<br>
“I guess that’s for you to find out. You’ll be fine.” She smiled. “I have to go now, and you have some thinking to do. Good luck, brother.”<br>
<br>
“Thanks, I guess. Be safe, sister.”<br>
<br>
The warrior wandered the paths of Greater Faydark for hours. He reminisced about the party, about Lamila.<br>
<br>
Lamila leaned back into his chest and he instinctively wrapped her up in his arms, holding her close and taking in her scent. As she sighed and smiled, he felt a peace wash over him. They talked for hours and at the end of the night, Lamila kissed him lightly and said, “Goodnight, my warrior.”<br>
<br>
Like a flash of inspiration, Uhrlik got an idea of how to win her heart. The warrior ran as fast as he could back to the shuttles to catch the Maiden’s Voyage and head back to Kunark. Once he arrived in Firiona Vie, the elven outpost on Kunark, he set about trying to find the roses he had heard about from another old friend, Kalysha.<br>
<br>
The Rose of Firiona was a rare thing, indeed, and Uhrlik’s searches proved useless. He had no ability to forage for food like the wood elves and others like them. So he began asking the merchants around the outpost. Other hunters soon caught wind of his inquiries, and some stopped to ask why he needed the Rose. “A grand romantic gesture.” Was his response. Kalysha and Kin came to the outpost to look for the roses while he slept. After a week, he was finally ready with his grand romantic gesture.<br>
<br>
He sent Lamila a cryptic message stating that he “needed to talk to her about something”, and waited for her while hunting the elusive crazed goblins in the Butcher Block Mountains. Kalysha and another member of Feir’Dal hunted with him that night, but only Kalysha knew what was about to happen. <br>
<br>
Lamila finally tracked him down and sat patiently nearby while the three dispatched a final goblin. Uhrlik then drew up all of his might, all of his inner strength and stood before the woman he loved. He kneeled in front of her, looking into those crystal blue eyes that made him weak in the knees. He could see that she was nervous as well, as she laid a hand on her stomach to calm the butterflies within.<br>
<br>
If I don’t do this now, Uhrlik thought to himself, I’ll kick myself forever. He took a deep breath. Better do it now before we both lose our nerve. He handed her his gift in two small bags and spoke without a hint of the uncertainty that rolled in the pit of his stomach. The Hate and the Song were nowhere to be found, as if they both waited with bated breath for what was about to come. “Lamila,” he started, “I love you, and all I can offer you is forever. Will you marry me?”<br>
<br>
Tears streamed down Lamila’s face as she opened the bags to find one dozen Firiona Roses. “Yes, I will marry you, Uhrlik. Thank you for the dozen roses, I love them and you always.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you for forever,” he smiled widely. For the first time, he understood what his father had found in his mother. He understood the wave of peace that this kind of love could bring, the kind of love that his hatred could not stand against.<br>
<br>
Lamila laughed, her nerves finally settling, “So do you want to tell the family or should I?” <br>
<br>
Uhrlik saw more of Norrath than he had ever imagined in the coming months. He never left Lamila's side as she went about her guild duties. He loved to watch her work. Occasionally, it would all be too much and she would turn to him and bury her face in his chest, crying that she couldn’t do it anymore. He would hold her and stroke her hair and whisper a few words in her ear and she would stop crying and beam a smile at him, hugging him tightly.<br>
<br>
Lamila had motivated him as well. Uhrlik spent every moment of his sleepless nights hunting. Lamila was far more experienced than he was, and he desired nothing more than to rise up and be as near to her equal as he could. He would hunt with his guild mates when they were around, but more often than not he hunted alone.<br>
<br>
All too soon the date was set. The guests were invited, the food was being made and the alcohol was being brewed. Uhrlik’s stomach was uncharacteristically aflutter. He knew that they had planned this down to the smallest detail, but he felt as if something was missing. There was something he had to do.<br>
<br>
So one night, while staying at an inn in the Common lands, Uhrlik crept from the bed and left Lamila resting comfortably on his pillow. He left her a note telling her that he had one last errand before they could be married. He ran through the Commons to the Desert of Ro, at last finding what he was after.<br>
<br>
A small tent with a lone figure squatting under it, staring thoughtfully out at the stars. Ortallius looked as pained as ever. Uhrlik approached him and greeted the orc with a bow.<br>
<br>
“I had to see you again,” the warrior started. “To tell you that I have filled the void that once marred my heart.”<br>
<br>
Ortallius merely stared at him quizzically. “Do go on, Uhrlik.”<br>
<br>
“I have found a family with The Feir’Dal, but most importantly, I have found love. She has filled my dreams as long as I can remember, and my heart as long as I have known her. She was the part of me that was missing, cast on the winds of fate at my birth. Now I have found her, now forever begins.”<br>
<br>
The gentle orc smiled at the last, “At last you have peace. Good luck to you, brother.”<br>
<br>
The two shook hands one last time. As Uhrlik turned away, he saw the glimmer of a tear rolling down Ortallius’s face. Perhaps he would know peace someday, it wasn’t likely, but the warrior hoped with all his heart.<br>
<br>
The day of the wedding arrived, the sun just rising as Uhrlik crept into the room to slip back beneath the covers. Lamila woke just as he got his boots off and asked, “You’re up awfully early. Dressed too? I thought I’d have to drag you out of bed kicking and screaming.” She paused and mumbled, “As usual.”<br>
<br>
“Very funny. Will you be joining me today or will I be getting married alone?”<br>
<br>
Lamila chuckled at him and rushed to get dressed. Since he was dressed already, Uhrlik sat in a chair near the door and watched her. She was so beautiful. There was a rosy tint in her cheeks and she glowed in anticipation. He could not help but stare at this vision as she transformed herself into the regal wonder that she presented to the rest of the world. A truth much closer than most would know, Lamila was always very tight-lipped about her past.<br>
<br>
The warrior found himself blinking profusely to clear away the tears welling in his eyes. He had found his happiness, and he knew that she felt the same way.<br>
<br>
“What are you staring at?” Lamila asked and he shook himself back into the moment. She was dressed and ready to go now. She stared at him with an odd look on her face, but it seemed that she couldn’t stop smiling.<br>
<br>
“My future.” Uhrlik answered simply.<br>
<br>
She turned her back to him and said in a broken voice, “If you’ve settled up with the innkeeper already, we’ll be heading out now.”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik nodded as she began weaving her energies. She knew that he had settled their bill already, but it was an excuse for him to not see her cry.<br>
<br>
A portal of energy enveloped him and they swiftly found themselves in the Butcher Block Mountains. They ran west, to the ocean. The spot of their wedding was near the ocean, just south of the fishing village there.<br>
<br>
Guests had already begun arriving, and they milled about introducing each other when they found someone new. Annastrianna was there with her new little friend Bruska, the dwarven cleric. Amarante and Dauphine arrived, and most of Feir’Dal was running from all over Norrath to witness this event.<br>
<br>
Galanea, Lamila’s younger sister, sat with her back resting against a knotted old tree. Uhrlik sat next to her so Lamila could have the last few moments before the wedding to herself. Her nerves were a wreck, and there were still guests to greet and makeup to fix and prayers to be made. His last words to her before he left were “Calm, breathe.”<br>
<br>
“Are you nervous?” Galanea asked wryly.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik shook his head, “I won’t be nervous until it actually starts.”<br>
<br>
“You are a strange little man,” the druidess laughed.<br>
<br>
“I suppose I am.” He said thoughtfully. “You know that Feladin, my brother and best man, won’t be able to make it today?”<br>
<br>
“Really? Why?” Lamila’s sister asked in shock.<br>
<br>
“He is stuck somewhere on Kunark and can’t get here in time.”<br>
<br>
“That’s sad.” Galanea sighed.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik shrugged, “It’s ok really. Lamila’s maid of honor is my ‘little sister’ Kin, won’t be here either. She’s been missing on Kunark for a week or two now.”<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry to hear that. I’m sure she’s all right.” Her comforting words held a tone that said she didn’t believe them herself. Uhrlik merely nodded and grunted in response.<br>
<br>
A throng of women surrounded Lamila as she made her final preparations. They encircled her so completely that she was utterly obscured. Uhrlik couldn’t help but laugh as they all fussed over her. He had a constant line of men shaking his hand and saluting him. Two of them, a reformed Teir’Dal necromancer named Obien, and a stout little dwarf named Rabby, even gave him a cookie. Bright eyed and capable Kitanion rushed up to him and gave him a high five and patted him on the back. All three were members of his guild, and it warmed the warrior deeply to see so many of his family there.<br>
<br>
A black robed High Elf strolled confidently into the mix and stopped before Uhrlik. He smiled widely and hugged him. “Congratulations, Uhrlik. I have a present for you.” The man reached into a fold in his robe that hadn’t been there a moment before and extracted two wedding rings, diamonds set in the odd velium metal.<br>
<br>
“Thank you for coming, Valley. I’m honored that you came.” He bowed to yet another member of his extended family.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, there were three quick claps of thunder followed by a single bolt of lightning. The line streaked from the cloudless sky and struck the ground where the ceremony was about to take place. A woman stepped from the bolt as it disappeared harmlessly. She was a half elf in appearance, but it was clear that she was not normal. She was a member of a strange race of demigods that sought tirelessly to right the wrongs that the gods committed upon their creations. They led a weary life, as their limited powers often left them unable to help, leaving them as nothing more than observers and witnesses to the crimes of the Pantheon.<br>
<br>
She spoke in tones of rolling thunder, “My name is Aughisky.” The milling crowd stood silent as she continued. “I hope you don’t mind that I invited some of my friends.”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik stood wide eyed, “Of course not, the more the merrier.”<br>
<br>
In a geyser of flame two more of the Outsiders appeared. They introduced themselves as Kreena and Hawthorne and stepped off to the side, speaking in a language that he could not understand.<br>
<br>
“An impressive gathering,” Aughisky smiled. “Are we ready to start?”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik nodded, “Aye, now more than ever.”<br>
<br>
“Would you like to face the sea or your guests?” She asked him as if she already knew the answer.<br>
<br>
“We would like to face our guests.”<br>
<br>
“Do you have the rings?”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik nodded again and handed her the rings that Valley had just presented him.<br>
<br>
“Good. I will bless them and return them at the appropriate time. You have written your own vows, have you not?”<br>
<br>
The warrior laughed, “Yes we have.”<br>
<br>
The women began to depart to take their places next to their dates, and Uhrlik saw his bride. His heart skipped a beat as she strode nervously to his side. Every emotion he had ever felt paled next to their love as it mixed in his heart. There was nothing else in the world but this woman, nothing but the path that they would take as one from now on. Finally, he could understand the vision that had haunted him his whole life. This feeling was the whole of earthly emotion. This is what mattered.<br>
<br>
Aughisky cleared her throat and waved a hand over the assembly. People sat silent as her hand passed over them. When she came back to Lamila and Uhrlik, their backs to the crashing surf below them, she began to speak. Her voice was loud enough for the host of guests to hear, yet she did not yell or strain. Her tone reminded the warrior of a spring rain, soothing and nurturing. “'Let the four directions be honored that power and radiance might enter this rite for the good of all beings.<br>
<br>
“'We stand upon this sacred Earth and in the Face of Heaven to witness the Rite of Marriage between Lamila and Uhrlik of the clan Feir'Dal. <br>
<br>
“Just as we come together as family and friends so we ask for the greater powers to be present here within our circle. May this sacred union be filled with their presence.”<br>
<br>
A lush green energy poured from the woman’s hands, “With the blessing of the deep and fruitful earth, we call upon the powers of the North!”<br>
<br>
The green was replaced swiftly with a blazing inferno, “'With the blessing of the inner fire of the sun, we call upon the powers of the South!”<br>
<br>
A fluid blue seeped from her hands and quenched the fire, “With the blessing of the sacred waters of the pool, we call upon the powers of the West!”<br>
<br>
Her hands flashed with a white wind, “With the blessing of the clear pure air, we call upon the powers of the East!”<br>
<br>
All four of the magical energies combined into one flow that surrounded and permeated the couple before settling into the ground around their feet, “May the harmony of this circle be complete....Blessed Be.<br>
<br>
“As the Sun and the Moon bring light to the earth do you Uhrlik and you Lamila vow to bring the light of love and joy to the union and do you vow to maintain these vows in freedom, for as long as they shall last?”<br>
<br>
The two spoke in unison with complete conviction, “I do.”<br>
<br>
Aughisky nodded to herself and smiled, “Then at this time profess your vow one to the other.” She motioned to Lamila.<br>
<br>
“Uhrlik Before you came into my life my heart was lost and alone. Now with you by my side I am truly whole. You are my Champion my Future and my reason for Being.” She sniffed and her eyes welled up with tears, “Today I give you my heart body and soul, I will Love you till forever fades and beyond.” The tears streamed down her cheeks unhindered. She was not afraid of them, rather, they were a symbol of her love and its purity.<br>
<br>
There were tears flowing freely among the guests, and another flash of crystal blue water marked the entrance of another of Aughisky’s race. Uhrlik took a deep breath and tried to calm his jittering nerves. All eyes were on him now, and he began his vows while mustering all of his vaunted courage.<br>
<br>
“Lamila, Heart of my heart, I knew from the first time I lay eyes on you that there could be no other. In you I see my future. You are my motivation and my motive, the reason for my every breath. I am here today to pledge myself to you in words as I have in mind, body and soul. I will love you until forever fades and mountains crumble to dust…Then I will love you still.”<br>
<br>
A small cheer rose among some of the more rowdy guests, and Aughisky and her fellows glared at the interruption. The demigoddess addressed them again when the guests were quiet once more, “All things in Nature are circular, these things are part of the Great Mysteries. Lamila and Uhrlik, you have given me rings to bless as your symbols of these Great Mysteries of Life.” A small glow emanated from her hands as she handed Uhrlik his ring for Lamila.<br>
<br>
“Please repeat after me. ‘Lamila, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love for you. Let it remind you always as it circles your finger, of my eternal love. You are my beloved and I marry you today with this ring as I give you my heart, my body, and the very breath of my soul.’”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik repeated the words, remarkably keeping his voice from cracking.<br>
<br>
She turned then to Lamila and handed her the ring to give to Uhrlik. “Lamila, please repeat after me. ‘Uhrlik, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love for you. Let it remind you always as it circles your finger, of my eternal love. You are my beloved and I marry you today with this ring as I give you my heart, my body, and the very breath of my soul.’”<br>
<br>
Lamila intoned the words, her face more serious than Uhrlik had ever seen it.<br>
<br>
Another cheer rose from the crowd and none made a move to stop them. When they were finished, Aughisky continued, “Let those assembled here bear witness that Lamila and Uhrlik of the clan Feir'Dal are joined in love. May their love partake of the beauty, majesty and power of the sacred land. May they grow together in wisdom, joy, and harmony. My own blessings and the blessings of all those assembled be with you.”<br>
<br>
Their ogre friends Bhah and Klutzee led the resounding cheer. The party that followed the ceremony was filled with cake and liquor. Lamila and Uhrlik handed out what Aughisky’s friends had given them, and they personally thanked everyone for coming. The four demigods disappeared sometime during the celebration, waving goodbye to all and good luck to the couple.<br>
<br>
Annastrianna approached her old friend, “How does it feel being married?”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik stopped and thought for a moment, “Right. It just feels right.”<br>
<br>
Hours flew by and the party dwindled slowly. There was still much liquor left unconsumed when it was over. At the end it was as it had started, just Lamila and Uhrlik. They held each other and Uhrlik sighed in contentment as the peace washed over him. It had been a good day.<br>
<br>
And so, Lamila Earthmyst and Uhrlik Pureblade became married in name as they had already in mind, body and soul. They began their life together as Lamila and Uhrlik Mystblade, a life they lead still with as much love and conviction as they started with.<br>

The Story of Uhrlik:<br>
Oath of Steel<br>
<br>
<br>
        As every historian of Norrath knows, there can be no peace without war. There is no golden age that does not end in blood. There are no miracles without tragedy. Such was the case with Uhrlik’s heart. Aye, he was married, and happily so. But there was still a dark place in his heart, a blackness in his veins that terrified those nearest him.<br>
<br>
        As the song of his love for Lamila grew stronger, so too grew the Hate that roiled in his blood. The rage devoured conscious thought when he fought. His teeth gnashed and he snarled in fury with every mighty slash of his weapons.<br>
<br>
He stood over the last of the felled drachnids, the foul creations of Mayong Mistmoore that littered the Dread Lands, with a monstrous presence. The thing’s slick green blood coated the warrior’s arms to his elbows, with splatter marks marring his breastplate. He clutched his drenched blades tightly and his eyes shifted to find his next kill. Something caught his ear and he turned to listen to his friends talking.<br>
<br>
“What did you say?” He asked, rather insistently.<br>
<br>
Feladin, his near-brother, guild mate and paladin of Tunare, jumped as if startled. “I was saying that Thunderhart and I came from Freeport. We spoke with the Knights of Truth and we’ve been charged with getting a confession from a fallen knight.” Feladin stood of a height with Uhrlik, though somewhat thinner. He was a compassionate soul that had saved Uhrlik’s life on numerous occasions with a well placed heal or the coveted gift of life that lay in his hands. That occurred even before they found out they were brothers.<br>
<br>
“We’ve also been told to eliminate him.” Thunderhart smiled dangerously. A dwarven paladin of Brell, Thunderhart had a bearing about him that made one forget that he was significantly shorter and more stout than he seemed. He was an honorable soldier, and he held nothing but contempt for those that had given up their holy station for the promise of quick power.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik’s eyes narrowed, “Lucan.” The paladins nodded. “I have a score to settle with him. We should go now.”<br>
<br>
“Are you going like that?” Lamila chuckled. The rage subsided at the sound of her voice and Uhrlik smiled at her. He laughed at himself as he saw the mess that the spider-things had made of his armor. He took out a dry cotton cloth and began wiping down his weapons and armor.<br>
<br>
“I have spoken with some of my close friends, as I know Feladin has also. They will be arriving on the border of West Freeport shortly.” Thunderhart explained. “The time is now, he must face justice.” There was a sound in his voice that spoke of long buried pain suddenly crying out from his core.<br>
<br>
Tucking the cloth away when he had finished Uhrlik stood and nodded to Lamila. His reddish breastplate gleamed and his weapons nearly glowed in his anticipation. “Let’s go.”<br>
<br>
Lamila began weaving a portal and they found themselves standing at the druid rings in the Common Lands. The rings were an amazing sight, despite their dilapidated appearance. They were wide stone circles that focused the natural energies of Norrath, enabling the druids to magically transport their small hunting parties or themselves to a given location. Each ring had its own feel, almost like its own taste. Some rings were beyond a young druid’s use, the flavor hidden from them until they were deemed ready.<br>
<br>
The construction of the rings had been lost to antiquity, only marginally recreated when the wizards began building their monstrous spires. Much more technological than spiritual, the spires were created as symbols of mortal triumph over Nature and the Pantheon. They required knowledge instead of faith, and so only the most learned of wizards could operate them.<br>
<br>
The four ran across the Common Lands until they reached the very borders of West Freeport. The stone walls that led to the city gates ending with the clean lines and right angles that the humans seemed so fond of. They were pockmarked and weathered by a constant sand filled wind, the land between here and the city gates had been completely eroded and blasted since the town was built.<br>
<br>
Leaning on the wall was Lamila’s younger brother, Webberran. A lithe ranger, he wore a wry smile as if he hinted at some secret that only he knew. With him were two familiar faces, the Ogres Bhah and Klutzee. Bhah was a Shadow Knight, like Uhrlik’s father, and his mate (Uhrlik assumed) Klutzee was a Shaman. Both were extremely well traveled and had no love whatsoever for the arrogant knight or his corrupt minions. They had no love for the Knights of Truth either, but that was beyond the point.<br>
<br>
So they began assembling the forces. Another friend slithered into the group as they prepared for the battle. He was a tall, well-muscled Iksar Monk named Mephiska, and he sneered at them, baring his sharp fangs. This smile seemed disconcerting to anyone that was unfamiliar with the Iksar race. They hated everything that was not Iksar, and they were not afraid to admit it. Meph, as they called him, had ventured long and far from Cabilis, the home of the lizard people of Cazic Thule, and so he had become somewhat used to the outsiders’ presence. He didn’t necessarily like outsiders, but he acknowledged their usefulness.<br>
<br>
“Ah, Thunderhart. My good friend,” Mephiska hissed. “This seems an adequate force.”<br>
<br>
The time grew short, and several more companions joined them. As well as Mephiska, another druid and a cleric, both friends of Thunderhart’s, came to them. A bard came to the call of Feladin, as had the two Ogres and Webberran. <br>
<br>
As they prepared, the energies of the druids and the cleric and the shaman infused Uhrlik’s body. He felt stronger, faster and sturdier than he had before. His nerves were steel and his mind was razor sharp. He had been waiting for this fight for a long time. The fallen knight would pay, not for his words to a young boy, not for the truth he had shared. He would pay for the torment he had inflicted on a young boy and the doubt he had cast on the memory of a father.<br>
<br>
Feladin wore an uncharacteristically grim visage. To him this was a problem that had to be dealt with. It was a duty and an obligation sent to him by Tunare, one that he would follow absolutely, but he didn’t have to like it. He had his own quarrels with Lucan but the man’s execution was a very serious matter. Uhrlik’s near brother refused to take this matter lightly.<br>
<br>
Thunderhart wore an equally severe countenance. He sat cross-legged on the ground idly stroking his beard and staring at – or through – the symbol of Brell Serilis that graced the face of his shield. There was a feel about him that this was the calm before the storm. Perhaps he debated the morality of the slaughter to come. Judging from the man’s unwavering honor, Uhrlik doubted that this was the case.<br>
<br>
The warrior and Mephiska waited somewhat impatiently as the others meditated before the fight. His parents had never managed to get Uhrlik to sit still long enough to get any use of the skill. As his parents had suspected, magical energies burned in his veins, but he had turned his back on those powers long ago. Slaughter was what he was made for, to square off against an opponent and win or die.<br>
<br>
A pair of hands, Lamila’s hands, cupped his face as she stared in his eyes with concern. It was then that Uhrlik realized that he gripped the hilts of his weapons so tightly that he was quivering. He took a deep breath and relaxed. The perpetual knot in his shoulders loosened slightly. Glancing around, he found that the others were ready. <br>
<br>
Mephiska and the two Ogres appeared to be relishing in the mindless death to come. Webberran replaced his smirk with a thoughtful, far away look. The paladins wore the same sober facade that Uhrlik knew that he wore himself. Lamila chewed on her bottom lip the way she always did when she was worried about him.<br>
<br>
The time had come. The plan was that Feladin would coax the errant knight out of the protection of the barracks and into the open. As the paladin strode across the biting sand towards the West Gate, the others assembled near the grassy border of the Common Lands. Any attempt to slay Lucan in the open would be madness, his corrupt guards were everywhere and would jump to his aid without thought. Long moments passed and there was nothing but an eerie silence. <br>
<br>
“He’s been gone too long.” Lamila stated nervously. “I’m going to see if he’s all right.” She ran into the city and disappeared behind the stone walls.<br>
<br>
Moments later, Feladin and Lamila came into sight, running at top speed to outdistance the flood of Militiamen at their heels. Lucan was there, too, leading the charge like the first drop of water in a tidal wave.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Lamila stopped and began summoning her energies. A hole in space opened briefly and she and Feladin were gone. The guards began to walk back into the city, muttering dejectedly and slaying the snakes and bats that swarmed in the expanse back to the city gates.<br>
<br>
A few guards found the Ogres and the Iksar and rushed them. They obviously thought that the three would be no problem since they did not call their corrupted brethren back. That was not the fight that interested Uhrlik, though.<br>
<br>
Standing before him was an object of his enmity. The man that had cast a shadow on his already blackened childhood. The fallen knight eyed him warily, seeing that the son of Amlik was no longer a simple child.<br>
<br>
“You know that this has to end,” Uhrlik stated.<br>
<br>
Lucan nodded, “It’s time to put one of our memories to rest.” He shook his head dismissing any conditioned retorts, “I heard you killed Dvinn. Your father worked very hard to put that man in power.”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik cut the man off, “And died for the effort. We both know the story.”<br>
<br>
“Too bad that you left Crushbone when you did. They found what they were looking for after all.”<br>
<br>
“Which was?”<br>
<br>
Lucan shrugged arrogantly, “Whatever it is, it’s on its way to the Dark Lord Innoruuk now.”<br>
<br>
“Doesn’t matter. I’m here to dispense justice…”<br>
<br>
“Justice?” The fallen knight interrupted, “This is revenge, boy, plain and simple. Don’t try to play the Judge, you are a Dark Avenger, a monster as vile as Dvinn and I ever were.” Steel flashed into Lucan’s hands as he drew his sword. “Now either kill me or join me in the Dark Lord’s service, but don’t patronize me.”<br>
<br>
The Hate roiled in Uhrlik’s veins with such force that he thought he might see his skin boiling. “I will not stop until the last of you is destroyed.”<br>
<br>
The erstwhile paladin’s mouth twisted in disgust, “Why don’t I just kill you now and save you the trouble? Martyr you now instead of making you beg for death from Innoruuk?”<br>
<br>
“For that you’d have to kill all of us as well, foul deserter.” Feladin spat. “We’ve come for your confession.”<br>
<br>
“And your head.” Thunderhart added.<br>
<br>
Feladin quirked an eye at the stout paladin and turned his attention back to Lucan. “Repent now and your end will be merciful.”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik turned his head to find all of his friends with weapons bared and severe faces. The bodies of the foolish Militiamen littered the ground beyond them. Then all hell broke loose.<br>
<br>
Mephiska leaped over Lucan and landed lightly, turning his momentum into a spinning kick that sent the knight reeling into the two paladins. Uhrlik rushed in to engage Lucan as Feladin and Thunderhart hacked away at his defenses. Lamila summoned her energies and suddenly a black cloud of vicious insects surrounded Lucan, stinging him mercilessly. His skin flared and blistered, but the fallen knight never missed a step. His blade flashing in the waning sun darted from one attack to another, blocking all advances. Bhah and Uhrlik rushed in to close Lucan’s escape.<br>
<br>
Seconds dripped to minutes, but it became obvious that Lucan’s defense was waning as fast as the sunlight. He took on a hunted look and tried to back his way towards the city, looking for the First among his corrupted confidants, Brother Jentry. The cleric was not showing though. The fallen knight had been abandoned to his fate, it seemed.<br>
<br>
Spells flared and blades clashed, and all at once, Lucan’s sword dropped. Poison and disease ran rampant in his veins, the stinging insects jabbing away like a million tiny daggers. Fire and ice rained down on his head. Steel pierced his body from a dozen places. Sir Lucan D’Lere was dying.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, his skin began to turn to dust. His eyes and innards melted away leaving nothing more than a blackened skeleton. The corruption that had tainted the man’s soul had infested the man’s bones and given them unnatural life. He cackled maniacally and hefted his sword anew.<br>
<br>
The paladins and the cleric set themselves against the Animated Hate that was once a man. Chunks of bone flew apart from the remains as they hacked and blasted away and in short order, the thing screamed in rage as it finally released Lucan’s soul. The hate that had infected Lucan exploded out in a ring, and Uhrlik felt somehow dirtier for it.<br>
<br>
The last rays of sunlight faded and the group stood staring at the dust that had been a worthy foe. They left in ones and twos, but always in silence. They had executed a man that had once been noble and righteous, a man that could not see the way back, and it weighed heavily on them.<br>
<br>
There, Sir Lucan D’Lere, the man that had renounced his holy duty for the bloody hatred of Innoruuk, the man that had created the method of his destruction in Uhrlik, there, Lucan died.<br>
<br>
The next day, Feladin and Thunderhart appeared with their reward for accomplishing their task. Each held a greatsword blazing like the rising sun, a symbol of their faith and dedication. There was a peace in Thunderhart’s eyes, but Feladin’s carried a great sadness. It was unlikely that his near-brother would ever shake the feeling of that hate and the look in the eyes of a man that he had helped to execute. Uhrlik was not sure that he cared what the man had been, only that vengeance had been served…<br>
