This thread is not about VoS, its not about any other spawn besides VS and its not about flaming other people with your opinions of them. Nor is it this threads intent to point out what flaws their might be with a rotation system and what Verants policies are either for or against one.<br>

It allows those guilds in the &quot;association&quot; a more relaxed existance with regards to EQ since they &quot;trust&quot; that people who have agreed to enter the &quot;Rotation&quot; will not try to &quot;beat them to the punch&quot; and therefore minimizes the competition for that spawn on that day.<br>
<br>
It cannot stop any other guild/person/entity from attempting to kill VS (or any mob) at any point it is up (and it is correct once someone has engaged VS for someone else to try to take the kill is a KS).  <br>
<br>
VoS proved they were able to take out VS and because of it were offered chance to enter the &quot;Rotation&quot;.  AC proved they were able to do similar by taking &quot;an equivalent or harder mob out&quot; and were also offered a spot in the rotation.  Then for whatever reason they took the word of someone that the rotation was no longer in effect without bothering to check with the people that they had entered into an agreement with (be it a miscommunication, a misunderstanding, a lack of procedure, what have you).<br>
<br>
The result of that incident is that for whatever reason an agreement and &quot;trust&quot; was broken and that &quot;trust&quot; is also what allows others to base decisions on other dealings.  As I stated before an agreement only works when all parties trust the other members to deal honorably and fairly.  It is my understanding that the current leadership of AC is working towards repairing the &quot;broken trust&quot;.  It is my opinion that once that &quot;breach of trust&quot; is repaired that AC will most likely join the rotation if that is what they wish.  They or anyone has the right to choose not to do so but by doing so they will face more contention for VS then they would if they were in the rotation (a FFA if you will).<br>
<br>
Please note that I speak only for myself and my understandings of the current situation.  I am not representing my guild or that of any member of the rotation.  With that disclaimer made I wish everyone a safe gaming experience.<br>

<br>
As I stated, I do make a poor teacher because I lack the patience to deal with those whom simply lack the level of comprehension to which I am accustomed.  Never the less, I shall make one last attempt at it.<br>
<br>
As for these rules you speak of when you say VoS broke the rules.  There are no rules.  There are only guilds whom agree to work together.  VoS has agreed to respect the rotation guilds turns, the rotation guilds have agreed respect VoS turn. Even with my superior intellect, I would be hard pressed to make it any simpler then that.<br>
<br>
When you say and  I quote you here <b>"How is it that you need to get 'permission' from the other guilds to take a spawn now"</b>  I never stated that anyone needed to get permission to take a spawn.  Never have you ever seen me say that in print or otherwise.  I am appalled that you have intentionally or otherwise chosen to change my words which I had take great care to  select.<br>
<br>
I am disturbed now, my patience with you has all but withered away.  My gut tells me that you are seeking to cause trouble where there is none, however there is still a slight possibility that your comprehension level is inadequate to fully understand things as they truly exist.  My own shortcomings as a patient teacher prevent me from further instruction at this time.<br>

I am sure we all want to know why the hell he is interested in such a topic and why people will take the time to answer him, if he chooses to hide behind a name. Post your affilation here so we all can understand better your questions. Stop hiding behind a silly name.<br>

Unless he is in AC, or one of the rotation guild, then he has no buisness on this thread. (other than just to observe what the result is of the other guild working out a solution).<br>

As Valas has stated you do not need permission to &quot;take the spawn&quot;.  What you do need permission for is to &quot;join the rotation&quot;.  There is no way the rotation guilds can prevent anyone from killing Venril Sathir when he is up (other than beating them to the spawn).  I admit, from my point of view when I was outside the rotation it looks very unfair... but when you really come down to it... the rotation is not a monopoly and does not violate the PnP policies.  Hope that clears things up. <p>Nyatese Nivaro<BR>

<br>
<br>
this is what i'm saying kinda. just as far as it not being very fair to anyone outside the rotation. but once you're in it.. oh yah it's a great idea... cuz you always are assured of getting a couple pairs of legs to play with every week or whatever. when, you know if it were FFA, you wouldn't even bother going into karnor cuz you know some little level 50s are probably assembling to take him out when he pops or whatnot. or scheduled on the calendar. or the guilds that can't do ToV and can't get anything better than planes legs go to kill him. *shrug*<br>

What I was trying to imply is that no one is excluding guilds from killing VS.  It will certainly earn you a spot on the F&amp;R board... but no one is stopping you.  Just just have to beat a guild to the spawn.  The other alternative is to play by the rules the rotation has set up... and request to get in.<br>
<br>
Is it fair to the smaller guilds?  Well, yes and no.  Do they have an equal shot at it.  If they can mobilize faster than the rotation guild to take the spawn, then yes, they have an equal shot.  If not, well then learn to mobilize faster so you can get there before the rotation guild.<br>
<br>
Really... VS is an FFA mob... the difference only being that the mob is FFA between the rotation guilds, and all other guilds on the server.  The rotation guilds (in general), don't KS from one another... at least until now.<br>
<br>
BTW Yaen... at least I have seen the grass on both sides of the fence.  I'm not making judgements knowing only 1/2 the story.  Grow to understand the meaning of &quot;rotation&quot; before you critisize it.  NO ONE can keep other guilds from killing Venril Sathir.  But to kill him... you have to have quick feet. <p>Nyatese Nivaro<BR>
