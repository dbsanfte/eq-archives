 This system must address the points of:<br>
<br>
1. Having 1300+ people fairly share the few resources these planes have to offer.<br>
2. Each posting entity having their own uninterupted day in the plane they reserve.<br>
3.Each posting entity getting 1 plane day, before another posting entity gets a second.<br>
<br>
 For those that keep referring to all these people that  &quot; havnt had the chance to speak their opinions&quot;, i suggest you refer them to this msg at this time.<br>
 It is not the &quot; job &quot; of the people that take time to work on this calendar to get in contact with every member on the rathe, and if there are more than the 1300 people already represented on this calendar, then we have more of a population problem than anyone's realized.<br>
 This was asked before when these discussions of the calendar started, and i'm gonna ask for it again.<br>
 If those people that are referred to as not being able to voice their opinions after understanding the current state of the calendar as it is intended, they need not enter to bitch about it after an agreement is made.<br>
 Until such time as another fair compromise to all is agreed to on the calendar, the current state of the calendar has been agreed upon by approx 1300 planeable people on the rathe and will remain until those people present a better, more fair system for the rathe, or until we get a server split.</font><P><table width="50%" border="0">

The calendar is already in effect and being used.  If the only thing that is not 100% implemented yet is the BigBrother calendar, let's declare that system as it stands in full operation.<br>

And perhaps create a new forum for 'why the calendar sucks for independents and i know why, even though i'm in a guild of 40+ people' , since we keep getting more and more of these types of messages. 8P<br>

You don't want to give up anything.<br>

<br>
I'm sorry this server is too large and too crowded.  I personally believe asking for anything LESS then 40 people is greedy.  As do many other.  You don't even offer a comprimise.  You want to be able to take 6 people into the plane if you see fit.  I'm sorry, thats incredibly greedy of you.  We're trying to maximize the plane usages for everyone.<br>
<br>

My suggestion to you is to make some friends and join some raids.  It would take all of 10 minutes to get an invite.</font><P><hr></hr>

I am not sure who posted it or where it went. <br>
<br>
Essentially, have 1 day a month where people that do not have posting rights under the 40 person minimun be given a chance for. It is not a FFA, but people like Clept and others like him that have no alliance be able to post on that day. <br>
<br>
It is not an alliance, they choose to have access to it. In the end I am not sure how *right* it is to say 'you cannot go there'. I understand motivations for the 'greater good' is a factor, however, fair is fair . <br>
<br>
I honestly do not see why we cannot keep a day for those of us that have alliances for Epic items and cater to those that choose not to. <br>
<br>
It is somewhat arrogant of anyone to say 'thou shall do that and not this'. It is not in the spirit of this game nor the reason why I play it. Aye, my guild and its alliance allows us to book a date , however, I hate to see someone not be at least given a chance. <br>
<br>
Keep it if you must at 40 people. But saccrifice 1 day a month for others. There are many ways to organise this so that no one is abusing the system or taking advantage of the rest of us. <br>
<br>
Those 'unallied' guilds w/o posting access have their own forum, or they make one. But we have to be just and give up that one day. At least for now this is a win win. Combined with 2 more planes and possible server split, this can and should be done. <br>

Clept will want it for his group.  Zanthor will want it for his group.  Jamany will want it for her group.  Now... who's going to police it so whoever signs up will get their day, and everyone else will honor it?  The admins of this Calendar?  I don't think so.  <br>
<br>
This also means that the 3 of them will get 1 day in a Plane every 3 months, maybe.  Will they be satisfied with this?  I doubt it.  And what happens if more 'independents' want their day too?  1 day every 5 or 6 or 8 months?<br>
<br>
BUT if they get together a posting entity they will be in the rotation, and get 1 day a month just like the rest of the guilds of the Rathe who are willing to compromise.</font><P>Nycah Aries'Syrensong<BR>

But the simple fact of the matter is, with 5 planes effective this week, and a number of 40 minimum for the planes, EVERYONE will get to go once a month. <br>
<br>
On Clept and the others, they should be allowed to go up, together, one day a month. Simple. It is about doing the right thing. <br>
<br>
The only way this system is going to work is with integrty. If you let emotion into the argument, it will fail. We have to be fair to everybody. Crickey, this is not Rocket science, we want to implement a server wide agreement. This means we have to cater to EVERYBODY on this server. <br>
<br>
It is about doing what is right. We are all mature adults here. On say the first Tuesday or whatever of every month is a chance to give those guilds with 10 or less or something like that, a chance to go to the planes. <br>
<br>
It is doing what is right people. I like the calendar, and I can see you do too. Guess what, maybe the unaligned guild do as well, give them a date. Turn this into a win win for everybody. <br>

<br>
So there are 1300 planable chars. approx, while this is a very high number this doesnt take into account that probably 1/2 those peeps are already wearing full planes gear. Is it really greedy of small guilds to want a full day, when the uber guilds complain and yet (guessing) 70-80% or there primarys are in full planes gear and chances are there just equipping alts or lettin it rot in hopes of killin the god for epic items. The panes have been around over a year and many of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds had stopped posting until they added epic quests, as so many were already in full gear. <br>
<br>
I like the idea of needing less than 40 46+ peeps, but I also see the problems with smaller numbers. Who said you also HAVE to post once a month, if there are just too many guilds dont up the number of people required just make it 1 raid per 45 days. Or make raids last 12 hours. Most guilds clear in 6-8 hours (some less some more) but a 12 hour window basically allows a full clear. (many guilds only clear the zone once anyway leaving repops up for several hours at a time)<br>
<br>
Anyway here are some of my thoughts....<br>
<br>
1. Require a guild to have 18+ planable peeps to post.<br>
(Rosters must be sent in and verified, any guild breaking the rules get blacklisted)<br>
<br>
2. Guilds that havent killed a God or cant need to include a &quot;Big Brother&quot; guild with there submission, these guilds will be called to kill the epic mobs and recieve nothing but epic loot. (To be listed as a big brother guild they will need to prove themselves I.E SS's of X characters with an epic item (probably 4+ not counting ragebringers, and cleric maces)(Clearing Isle 6 in sky makes no sense as a goal since only 1 epic quest requires something from this high in sky and NO ONE has solved that quest yet.)<br>
<br>
3. Once a certain number of guilds are registered (Id say somewhere around 35+) THOSE GUILDS decide if they want to extend the calendar to 45 day period OR (I would recommend) setting raids to 12 hours, thus giving around 60 dates a month.<br>
<br>
I firmly believe most of the posting guilds only plan 1 clear in there 24 hour period, thus wasting a lot of open time. (After our last hate raid, we inserted about 2 hours before our start time and no one was in there and the next day after hour raid ended it was almost 8 hours after that the next guild started inserting.)<br>
<br>
But I'm sure it doesnt matter what I say as this forum appears to just be a cover. The issue is done and decided with this just being posted to make it look like an attempt to appease people. Im hoping my ideas will be good enough to warrant a &quot;good ideas but too bad, the new calendar is done, post but Im guessing it wont happen I'll just get a &quot;thats not gonna work cause I said so&quot; post like the last guy. </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulindara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lindara</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Wog</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>8</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12/4/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11:56:43 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://frontpage.home.net/lindara/qsmlindara.jpg WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=204></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Asking again.</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">The idear about 18 planeable people was brought up THREE months ago.....<br>

<br>
In order for this type of system to work we'll all have to depend on a certain amount of trust from each other.  I'd have to trust you Nycah and you'd have to trust me not to abuse this system.  I don't think asking anyone to &quot;police&quot; this is an option.<br>
<br>
Setting up a discussion topic on this board for a system like this would be great.  People that intend on entering the plane can meet up and discuss how they are gonna handle the break in etc.<br>
<br>
So, here's a breakdown of how this would work.  I'll use Clept as a guine pig, hehe hope he doesn't mind :P<br>
<br>
**A day is set asside on the calander labled &quot;Independant&quot;.<br>
<br>
**Clept see's this and rallys his troops (6-10people).<br>
<br>
**Another group that doesn't fall under the 40 limit see's this also and they rally there troops (1-8 people).<br>
<br>
And so on and so forth....<br>
<br>
**They all post on this board under a topic the administrator of this site creats for independants.<br>
<br>
**The group leaders get together and discuss how they will break into fear. yadda yadda....<br>
<br>
**Then the magik day arrives and they all get to play happily in Fear (or where ever) and everyone dies a bunch of times but in the end they all have fun, maybe even make new friends and possably even forge new alliances.  Then suddenly they figure out they have 40 plane able peeps and they fall under the 40 person rule.  They thereby get to enjoy more fear, hate and sky trips and everyone is happy )</font><P>Gumy Bare

<br>
The idea to split the plane, might work for some but not most as not everyone is around during the day time on a weekday when the plane will be popping. (that should be obvious)<br>
<br>
With the previous rules it already was over 45 days between same plane raids.<br>
First raid April 6, second raid May 30th.<br>
<br>
If you want to write up the code for that nightmare go for it. But I don't believe most who currently use the calendar will agree with those rules.<br>

Can you figure out a way around that? If you know the workings of fear, there's no way to schedule it without effecting someone elses raid unless you do it on a day to day basis. Least none that i've seen.<br>
<br>
Hate = a 4 hour wanderer respawn and a 9 hour static respawn. maestro is 24 hours. Having two raids per day could work, but again, that would depend on having 1 group in the morning, 1 group in the evening. that would also depend on a groups ability to clear that plane in a sufficient amount of time to allow that second raid to start early enough for those people to complete it. doesnt seem to realistic , good in theory though.<br>
<br>
&quot;So there are 1300 planable chars. approx, while this is a very high number this doesnt take into account that probably 1/2 those peeps are already wearing full planes gear.&quot;<br>
-- those guilds still have people that need epic quest items from certain mobs in these planes ( thanks verant ). if they didnt reserve a day like everyone else, there's no way to get those items except hoping the epic calendar rotation would allow them 1 chance a month for everyone on it. With the amount of guilds on the epic calendar atm, this would amount to a possibility once every few months. This being a greatly reduced chance for those items, those that have full gear, always have people on those raids to loot gear so that none is wasted. ( except maybe SK gear considering it pretty much rain.)<br>
&quot; if there are just too many guilds dont up the number of people required just make it 1 raid per 45 days.&quot;<br>
-- Tried this, people dont like waiting over a month for 1 day in the planes, EQ wont be around forever. 1 in 45 days, will soon be raise to 1 in 60, with the rising population of planeable people on this server. 45 days = 6 weeks = not acceptible to a lot of people which has already been discussed.<br>
<br>
 These discussions have been going on for two months.<br>
<br>
 Your thoughts:<br>
1. This is what the calendar was. 18+ per posting entity. This was created when there was around half the planeable population on the server. This was a lot of people's problem with it, way too much time between plane raids. Which, in effect, caused talked and threats of FFA.<br>
<br>
2. This, in effect is the same thing as the epic rotation. island 6 clearing is not difficult, but it is obtainable for any guild / alliance of people that are organized. Wasnt meant to be obtainable by only a couple guilds on the server, was meant to be obtained by any guild or alliance that works together, if they can clear island 6, they're organized enough to be able to take down other difficult mobs pertaining to some of these epic quests.<br>
<br>
3. The calendar with 18+ per posting entity well exceeded more than 40 guilds that met that requirement, and more were up and coming. This is the calendar that doesnt work with the now population of planeable people on the rathe. Read reponse to #1 above.<br>
<br>
&quot;I firmly believe most of the posting guilds only plan 1 clear in there 24 hour period, thus wasting a lot of open time.&quot;<br>
-- like i said earlier in this post, this &quot; might &quot; work for hate, but as for fear, i dont personally see this happening due to the respawn being greater than 12 hours. 14 - 16 to be a little more accurate. There is no way to clear fear twice in one day. a few respawns, sure, but those respawns would not be up for the next posting entity to clear unless there was a 14 - 16 hour lapse in between raid, which would only happen IF one posting entity was euro and did their raid at night, and the next posting entity  started late the next evening. As said before, contact that next entity reserving that day and ask them if they mind you killing some respawns to make sure it doesnt conflict with their plans.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I'm sure it doesnt matter what I say as this forum appears to just be a cover. The issue is done and decided with this just being posted to make it look like an attempt to appease people&quot;<br>
-- discussions lead to ideas, ideas lead to change due to circumstances. This has been repeatedly asked for. Problem is most of the ideas, if not all, that have been brought up, after 30+ current posting entities agreed to what we have currently, have been discussed. The idea of 1 or possibly 2 days per cycle was brought up 2 months ago or so, and put on the back burner until the current infrastructure of this system was redone to suit the needs of the 1300+ people that have agreed to it. The ones that had accepted the publically stated invitation to offer ideas and help hash this out. Those that didnt get involved, werent left out, everyone knew this msg board was up and this was happening. The idea of 1 or possibly 2 days a cycle is currently being discussed on another thread to possibly be added later. What isnt acceptable to these posting entities is waiting 6+ weeks between raids, which, was happening.<br>
 This isnt a &quot; thats not gonna work cause I said so&quot; post, this is a &quot; good ideas, but some of it isnt realistic&quot; post, due to it's been either discussed and turned down by most, or tried and failed, and people dont wanna go through it again.<br>
 Again, ideas are good, dont be discouraged from posting well thought out ideas or thoughts on the subjects when someone either disagrees, or says &quot; we've tried it, didnt work &quot; or &quot; that was already discussed and most didnt agree to it &quot;. remember, this isnt 1 person or 1 group of people or &quot; uber &quot; guilds only that are agreeing or disagreeing to this system, it's everyone from non guilded to large guilded. Some of the people here have been around ( maybe even you ) since fear and hate opened, and saw many of the ideas brought forward now, and dont wanna go through it all over again.<br>

<br>
Clept brings up his group (8-12 people)<br>
Jamany brings up her group (6 people)<br>
BotBH bring up their group (12-18, say)<br>
Random_independents00 (4-12 people)<br>
Xenth &amp; co come up  (6 people)<br>
J.Random.Player_guild (6-8 people)<br>
<br>
that's a minimum of 42 and a max of 64 right there.<br>
<br>
And that's just 4 of the supposed disenfranchised guilds.  If this is an open day for indi raids, there is going to be upwards of 200 people zoning in.  And there will be nothing anyone can do to stop them on that day.  After all, they should all get their shot at a plane raid, right?<br>
<br>
Unless you're going to say this 'indi' day should have a LIST of people ALLOWED to come up for a particular raid.<br>
<br>
in which case, why not just form an ad-hoc posting entity, get a 1-shot password for your provided list of 40 planeable people, and hit the planes that way?<br>
<br>
If people want to try a FFA day in the planes, I'll support it.  I think it's a bad idea, but if it will get people to stop asserting that things are 'unfair' only because the rules aren't precisely to their liking, that's fine by me.<br>
<br>
But what about the west coast guilds?  Won't the FFA day be UNFAIR to them, since the east coasters will be able to log on before them and start the raid early?  How far do we want to take this concept of 'fairness' ?  Perhaps we should just set a start/end time for the plane, and NOBODY gets to be in the plane from last spawn kill the day before to 7am the day of FFA.  Then at precisely 2am the FFA day is declared over, everyone out, to leave time for respawn and return to the calendar.  If you don't do that, it wouldn't be fair to the west coast players, and would just be catering to those people who can get up earlier just by virtue of being in an uber time zone.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm being a bit of a jackass here, but I'm serious.  If the whole issue is about fairness, then we'd better be fair to the people who can't get in early on the FFA day, or else we're just going to have this exact! same! argument! in a couple weeks, with a couple of other people who come here looking for answers or a fight (or both).<br>
<br>
And i *still* don't see what the POINT is for these FFA raids. they're the same as being invited to another guild's raid, only with less organization.  I think everyone seems to believe THEIR guild will be 'running the raid' on the indi day.  Should make for an interesting situation.<br>
