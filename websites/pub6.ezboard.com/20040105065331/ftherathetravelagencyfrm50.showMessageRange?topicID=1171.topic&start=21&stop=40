If a person had managed to level a Beast Lord to 65 and wanted to go and do an SK next would you tell him.  Enn.  Too bad you master 70% of the game, now you need to start over in newbie hell (but of course wearing 100K worth of armor).  That is not serving any real purpose is it?  What is he going to learn from levels 1 to 45 except possibly some basic SK functions.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, EBAY or not, there is no reason to abuse him or harass.  Everyone is well within rights to ignore, shun, and even chatise those the group with him based upon Guilds that may be part of RTA and voted for the Blacklisting.  But beyond that sending him a &quot;hey dude you suck ass&quot; tell in game serves no purpose at all.<br>
<br>
If we are going to make EBAY toons a blacklisting offense then we are going to be pretty damned busy.  Beyond that what about Plat Buyers.  That has become so damned common at to be a joke.  There are people that are making RL LIVINGS buying and selling plat.  Who is going to be the auditor of that?<br>
<br>
Blacklist, Avoid, Ignore, Shun, and dont group or guid and shun those that do, but we need to not be part of the problem by being asses to a person that is NOT the person that caused the stink.<br>
<br>
Lastly, what will you require for a person to get OFF the blacklist?  I mean you going to force server moves and name changes or do we EVER allow people to ask for forgivenance?  From everything I saw we had a ganked mob and so stupid verbal exchanges.  What will be the end of it?  3 months, 6 months?  I mean, DAMN.  What do you want to see from people?<br>
<br>
Lastly I know that people in RTA (Reps Even) have grouped with Blacklisted people.  I am getting the impresions that a lot of people want to move on.  <br>
<br>
When is it enough?<br>

<br>
I never said I condone harrassment or spiteful /tells.  I have never sent one of those in my three+ years of playing.<br>
<br>
And I agree a blind monkey hitting attack over and over again can level up in this game.  But it is the reputation you create while leveling up that can't be bought.<br>
<br>
So people taking the easy way and E-Baying a toon so they can don't have to slog their way back to 60 will never have my respect.  If that character has a bad rep, well IMO you equally deserve that rep. and the consequences that comes with it.<br>
<br>
Now taking over a fellow guildee or a friends character that they aren't playing anymore is different imo.<br>

<br>
Time heals all wounds.  This guy doesn't act like a tard, get involved in tardish behavior. Helps people, is generally nice. Eventually his rep will slowly change. Someday, he can come to these boards, and say, &quot;Hey guys, I haven't caused any problems, been a jerk, or KS'd anyones orc pawns. Would anyone mind if I get removed fromt he blacklist.&quot;.<br>
<br>
Till then, anyone can say they are ebay'd. It's the first excuase anyone has besides, &quot;My friend was playing my account/posting, it wasn't me, I swear it.&quot; Proof will come from actions..<br>
<br>
I hope this guy didn't pay too much for that account. Odds of him getting into many guilds on the Rathe, are slim and none. Make one friend at a time, work to change the reputation he has inherited with that name, and over time people will forgive him, one player at a time.<br>
<br>
For now, my best advice for this guy, is to take it with a grain of salt, try to have fun, play nice, and help people. Hopefully people will remember that help, and stand by him when he wants to be removed.<br>
<br>
The blacklist was voted on, and should stay till it's voted on to take it down. For vince or anyone to remove it now would once again cause a whole bunch of people to scream of the black helicopters and how da man is keeping them down. We gave enough of that already...<br>
<br>
It's enough, when the community decides it's enough. The agreements we have on the Rathe are very fragile really. If people are allowed to flaunt the rules in our faces, others will follow. That's why some work to defend them. <br>
<br>
Guys got an uphill battle ahead of him, I don't feel too sorry for him though, he got what he paid for...<br>

That has been tried by many people and turned out to be a lie.<br>
<br>
I am inclined to believe that this is a new Karasu. However, rep goes with the toon not the player. Whether this is right or wrong is not really important, it is just a fact.<br>
<br>
If in fact you e-bayed this toon, then you have bought yourself some serious issues to deal with. Regardless of who is playing the toon, you are going to have to deal with that.<br>

I agree with the sentiment I hope you did not pay a lot for this account. <p>Shariona  57 Cleric  Circle of Virtue<br>
