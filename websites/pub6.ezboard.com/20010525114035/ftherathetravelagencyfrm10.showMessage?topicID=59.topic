<br>
Ok, so a total of 17 people in Fear were on the raid (says 18 in Fear but I don't count since I am not part of the raid).  Out of that 17, only a total of FOUR are from the posting entity.  Check the calendar for 11/13 (date stamp says 14th but that is because it was past midnight) and you will see that MCoD has Fear.<br>
<br>
Now, according to Rewena's list:<br>
<br>
MCOD:<br>
Doom Tribunal<br>
Circle of Virtue<br>
Mirth and Mayhem<br>
27<br>
<br>
Ok, now examine the people who are there.  You will see the following:<br>
<br>
0 Doom Tribunal<br>
0 Circle of Virtue<br>
4 Mirth and Mayhem<br>
<br>
I even /guildstatus for Tindar and Winterburn who were anon and neither of them were from any of the 4 guilds which are part of MCoD.<br>
<br>
Dunno how much clearer it can get for you honestly.  They were there at the bowl at nearly 2 am pst.  This is why the 2/3 rule is good.  The new rules that state that you only need 36 planable but can invite anybody as long as you don't invite more than 6 from any 1 guild is a load of crap.  If MCoD can get another guild added to their alliance to bring their total to 36 then they can post dates under the new rules.  Then what happens when they do this again?  What happens when you got 4 people from the posting entity and 13 from outside sources?  Well there aren't more than 6 form any 1 other guild so I guess its all good then right?  Wrong.<br>
<br>
You asked for some proof so here it is.  I didn't want to have to name people but I guess my word isn't good enough.  If you still doubt me and think I have fabricated this then I will post the damn screenshots that I took of the /who to quiet you naysayers.  This IS happening on a regular basis.  Yeah I know that servers coming down in the middle of your raid or Cazic deciding to spawn the zone on top of you sucks, but this was a clear day.  There was no draco, no god, and they were at the bowl at 2 am.  The posting entity accounted for less than 25% of the people at the raid.  Personally I think that at that point the raid was officially over and they were there clearing spawns as a pickup group. If the people who had the plane the next day thought that they were screwing with the spawntime for the next day, then I think they should have been forced to leave.<br>
<br>
I don't have anything against the people who were there.  I am pretty sure none of them thought they were doing anything wrong and since our rules are sorta up in the air then I think that this is sort of ambiguous at best.  However you must agree that having 4 people in the plane is a bit absurd.  It was not after a wipeout, it was not before they were leaving.  They were actively pulling mobs and killing them so their raid was continuing even though they had 4 people there.<br>
<br>
Personally I think the requirements for posting should be very high to lower the number of individual guilds posting which would force more alliances.  This will help free up a lot of time and make the distribution of armor and items a lot more fair.<br>
<br>
Big_Guild00 has 80 people, Big_Alliance00 has 5 gulids in it that equal 80 people.  Well forget about guildtags for a minute ok?  Now you got Group1 of 80 people and Group 2 of 80 people.  Each group of 80 will get the same amount of time and the same chance at armor and items.  That seems more than fair to me when compared to the way things were operating before.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unanilyasilverwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanilya Silverwind</A> at: 11/17/00 2:09:47 am</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udiossynsweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dios Synsweaver</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>57</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11/17/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>2:29:08 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Question on 'abuse'</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Nanilya-<br>
I figured someone was gonna bring that up so I'm way ahead of you, I talked to Wung that night in tells before I left fear and after the MCoD raid was over...whoever is in the plane after that I cannot speak for nor should I be held accountable for.<br>
<br>
We had ALL FOUR of our clerics cancel that night so we had to call in guests...cleric guests mind you, raids dont happen w/o clerics. We started clearing at about 9pm central and by 11:30 central we had the western half of the zone clear, past the Boogey house and gorgon roost and were moving to the WW tower to set up shop to finish clearing the eastern half. Well we missed a froggie before we moved and he feared someone which somehow chain agrroed half the damn zone. We did CR and I went LD for nealry two hours...when I came back on I was told all the clerics had to leave and as a result everyone left. I found out that while I was LD I had died and a few of my members had stayed in the zone to try and get my corpse but it was bugged...when I logged on Shao and SS were in the zone, I zoned up, got my corpse expressed my regret that the clerics had to leave and urged my members to leave the zone because our raid was over. As you can see only 4 of those members didn't leave the zone and you were left with a small band from SS.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you wanna complain about something, complain about leaving the zone not 100% cleared but thats about it. We've always cleared all our mobs on all our raids, save the temple and Maestro on our first raids (which I would assume is commonplace when starting out). If you had a problem you were more than welcome to contact me in game.<br>
<br>
 &lt;&lt;However you must agree that having 4 people in the plane is a bit absurd. It was not after a wipeout, it was not before they were leaving. They were actively pulling mobs and killing them so their raid was continuing even though they had 4 people there.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Yup, 4 people from a posting entity is pretty absurd. As a matter of fact it WAS after a whipeout and it WAS after we left. Regretfully some people stayed behind to continue pulling with those who had came into the zone after our raid was over(after I announced our raid was over and urged all members in tells to leave...before anyone gets confused or upset about the matter..hehe too late). Nanilya, your concerns are valid and the fact that you logged the text is nice, but please contact someone beforehand you start pointing fingers. However, the text you logged was not during our raid and if someone wants to take the mobs we left up they're more than welcome to (and no i DIDN'T call in a BB guild because by the time I got back on it was nearly 2am )as long as it doesnt effect the next guilds spawns.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;If MCoD can get another guild added to their alliance to bring their total to 36 then they can post dates under the new rules. Then what happens when they do this again?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No need for another guild dear...have 33 toons planeable already <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ...what happens if we do what again? Don't lock the door to fear when we leave, so the janitor can open it in the morning to let everyone else in?<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rude tone in the post Nanilya but if you had a problem you should have taken it up with me...I think it's more than clear by your /w list that the raid was over and some people formed a pickup group. If you would like a list of our planeable toons or all the individuals and their guildtags who attended our fear raid on teh 13th I'd be more than happy to mail it to you...<br>

If your raid was &quot;officially&quot; over then there were 13 outsiders and 4 MCoD people there clearing spawns in between a raid.<br>
<br>
If this had been the temple or something at 2 am that is one thing, because I doubt anybody starts their raid with the temple and complains that it hasn't spawned.  However clearing the bowl area at 2 am can create a spawn problem for the people who are there the next day.  So this wasn't an &quot;MCoD endorsed&quot; activity since your raid was over, that is not my point.  My point is that you had people there participating in the clearing of the plane in between scheduled raids.  If that is acceptable behavior then please post that officially someplace so I can see it.  As far as I know you did not ask anybody in MFH if it was ok to clear mobs that late (I say MFH because MFH had the zone the next day).<br>
<br>
Read my post again please.  You will find that in no place have I mentioned that it was in violation of the 2/3 rule because there is NO 2/3 rule right now.  I simply stated that this is why the 2/3 rule is GOOD.  I also stated that it was my personal feeling that having 4 people there would officially end any MCoD raid, and you have stated that I was correct.  Then the issue is not about having 4, it is that due to the fact that you have 4 there it is no longer an MCoD raid.  If it is not an MCoD raid, and not an MFH raid, then it is an indie raid that was taking place in between raids.  Again if that is acceptable then I am wrong, however at this time I do not recall ever seeing that this sort of thing is acceptable.<br>
<br>
I am stating that this sort of thing happens alot.  So your raid is officially over when most of you leave.  That is perfectly fine.  However having people stay or having new people come in to clear spawns in between raids (especially in what is generally considered the &quot;middle&quot; of the zone at such a late hour) in my view is wrong.  It is compounded if your own guild/alliance members decide to stay and participate in that raid, in which case your organization would have to take some of the responsibility.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udiossynsweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dios Synsweaver</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>58</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11/17/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>2:59:36 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Question on 'abuse'</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Nanilya- to be fair your points are more than valid as are your concerns and I AM taking resposibility for the issue right now by discussing it and later speaking with those members.

I HATE leaving anything up, but due to unfortunate time constraints by our clerics there wasn't much we could do.<br>
The case is simple, the raid was over, some mobs were left up and a few people who didn't know any better figured &quot;why not call some friends and clear the rest&quot;. No reason to point fingers or make any accusations however...just a case of some mobs being left up imo.<br>
<br>
2am pacific is the time generally accepted to be out of a plane correct? the time you had on the log was central or mountain I assume so either way I don't think it was a huge problem...if you still have any questions feel free to contact me in game or at dios@doomtribunal.com <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unanilyasilverwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanilya Silverwind</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>12</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11/17/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>5:52:42 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Question on 'abuse'</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I was in the zone and my guildmate just helped them finish cr so they werre not in CR mode when I made this log.  In fact this was about a half hour after they finished CR.  Dios and I have stated before they were actively pulling and killing mobs so this was normal raid activity.  They were not leaving either because they were still there quite some time after I logged this /who.<br>
<br>
I live in California so the time was Pacific Standard Time.  The people were in the plane after that posted time as well because I logged back in really fast about a half hour later to check and they were still there.<br>
<br>
I didn't post this the moment I saw this mind you.  I spent some time talking with my guild about it and after logging in a few times over the next hour and seeing them still there, I was sure that any sort of CR/exiting activity was not happening.  I was asked to provide some proof of abuse and this is the most recent event that I had proof of.  There is no point in posting something form 4 months ago in any discussion about abuse right now.<br>
<br>
The facts speak for themselves here.  Whether it was intentional or not is irrelevant.  Whether or not you like leaving mobs up is irrelevant.  A little while back another guild was in Fear trying to get Cazic and the zone was actually starting to repop on them.  Sure they probably hate leaving Cazic up but there is no clearer signal that you should go than the zone starting to respawn on top of you.<br>
<br>
As far as I know it is unacceptable to kill mobs in between raids.  What happens when your raid dies and it takes 3 hours to get a new non-posted one going?  Well that means that there will be a 3 hour gap in the spawn.  If the people who are there the next day have the unfortunate experience of having to sit for 3 hours waiting for mobs then I would definately say you inconvenienced them.  That is not saying that every raid has to adhere to specific time constraints.  However I do feel that if a raid is over and you want to kill mobs in between raids you must contact whoever is there the next day and ask them if it is ok.  I also think that if you are still roughly half done and its 2 am pst then its time to go, especially if you are not part of an official raid.<br>
<br>
People are blowing this way out of proportion right now.  Somebody did something they shouldn't have, that is all.  Maybe they knew that they were breaking some rule or maybe they didn't.  This is nothing to crucify them over.  I never said anybody should be punished or that they are mean nasty people.  I am saying this is something that shouldn't happen, so please don't do it again.  For those reading this please do not repeat this sort of thing.  Finally to those that wanted proof you have it here.  I never said they were repeat offenders or that they do this over and over.  This is just 1 case of 1 group of people doing something that as far as I know is not acceptable.<br>
<br>
If the rest of the people who read this think that this was acceptable behavior or that it was an innocent mistake then thats how you see it.  Personally I see it as a breaking of the rules and I was asked to post proof of such activity and I have fulfilled that request.  Nobody said that you had to agree with me or that I am the law.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usheltim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheltim</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>37</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11/17/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>6:38:58 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://members.home.net/jdelan/eq/sheltimmsgbd.jpg height=225 width=180></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Question on 'abuse'</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">So, who are you slamming? the ones that had the trip or the people in the planes not on the trip? <br>

Is Pof a zone?  Is it an EQ Verant Game zone.  Why do they have to ask your permission to be there?  I don't care if it is high level.  I don't care that you feel you have the right to say who can and can't be there.  My point is that i pay as much if not more for this game as everyone else and I should be able to go to whatever zone at whatever time I chose.  This whole thing has become a power issue.

-- pay as much if not more for this game as everyone else? umm last i checked everyone paid $9.89 right? i dont think it's an issue of how many accounts you have as to how much you pay to play =) We all pay the same amount. </font><P><table width="50%" border="0">
