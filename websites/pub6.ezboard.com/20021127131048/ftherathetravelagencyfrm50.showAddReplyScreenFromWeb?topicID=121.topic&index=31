<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm surprised I'm dignifying that with an answer. First of all, there are five guilds of various size and ability on the Dozekar rotation. Of those five, I would doubt that any *one* of them would want to rewrite the conventions of the rathe server. To assume that all five are trying to somehow inflate their position, at the same time, and in complete concerted efforts, is obviously wrong, and borderlines being willfully ignorant.  <br>
<br>
Secondly, your question is meant obviously to only inflame, rather than spark, intelligent discussion. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That's nice. How long has SoY been on the Dozekar rotation? How long have you been familliar with the gentleman's agreement on Dozekar? Have you worked with it before to see the way it runs? Can you contest that the original gentleman's agreement was radically differant than what is being presented to the rathe now? <br>
<br>
No? <br>
<br>
Awww, too bad then, your lack of support for a 'last minute change' is irrelevent.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
You wanna make a change? Fine. Give all the Guild leaders and Guild Reps the chance to give their say so, then ill have no problem following the new rule. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why, exactly, do you think that any guild *not* on this rotation should be allowed to tell the rotation guilds what to do, or how to do it? Quite frankly, if those 5 guilds wish to make a new clause in their rotation that they kill doz, and give all the loot to ME, that's their business, since they are the only ones doing it. After you get on the rotation, and see the &quot;yeah, Roggulbuk gets all the doz loot, per our rotation agreement&quot; clause, then you can say &quot;well, that's bullsh!t&quot; and have it mean something. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Until then dont expect everyone to obey your new law because..umm.. you said so?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Every time some new guild gets on a rotation, we don't have a town council meeting, get every guild representitive together, and bang out the details of the rotation again. You know why? Because they don't change when a new guild gets added. If you, personally, or your guild, cannot abide by the conventions of the Dozekar rotation, and can't help but kill the named drakes for no practical advantage to yourselves, by all means, go ahead. You will, I suspect, have them all to yourselves, minus the dozekar rotation guilds. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I think its lame that because 1 guild came up a little short handed and they actually have to wait another week before they see &quot;their&quot; mobs again. Truth is those mobs were never yours, they were FFA <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I am surprized that I have to even explain this to anyone. The fact that you are in a guild, and one that participates in some rotations already, should indicate that you have at least a miniscule degree of insight into the rotation system. Your statement, however, contradicts my supposition. <br>
<br>
On this server, for the duration of your turn, those mobs *are* yours. No other guild that is capable of killing the mobs, will do so, unless they are racing to actually get on the rotation, as your guild would have had to do. On, to the best of my knowledge, every *other* server, even if you are pulling the mob, it still isn't YOURS. Quite frankly, with our rotation system, and knowing in advance the day and approximate time a mob is due, if you 'came up short handed' with 24 hours in which to gather and engage and kill a mob that you've *already killed before*, then you really shouldn't be *on* that rotation. Personally, I think it's a little lax that guilds are allowed to pass on their rotation mobs: however, it's a server convention, and I respect that.<br>
<br>
And again, waiting a week is something that does not happen anywhere else but the rathe. Quite frankly, for the low to medium teir guilds (Velious and before), saying *anything* dispariging about the rotational system, or the way that it works, is the online equivilent of shooting yourself in the foot, kneecap, stomach and head. <br>
<br>
Why? Well, because, quite frankly, the guilds that are up owning the boss mobs of luclin do not have to worry about guilds that are still struggling with the boss mobs of Velious: we won't be killing luclin major mobs any time soon. As such, they could go around, ganking all the velious content and then go back to their luclin content at will, especially now with the absence of one of the sides of the 'big three' triangle. <br>
<br>
The rotation system works to the *detriment* of the strongest guilds on the server. I find it almost frightning that some people forget that, and do not treat a rotational system with the foresight that it deserves. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
(except for between <br>
2-3 old school guilds who shook hands in a deal that didnt involve me), but now that it isnt working out for them, they decided its time to change the rules for their benefit. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You find this personally offensive because it directly affects you... how? The handshake agreement still doesn't involve you, being that you're not on the rotation. If it is so blatently offensive to you, don't abide by it. Seems simple enough.<br>
<br>
If you were on the dozekar rotation, and the other guilds changed it to &quot;all the guilds except SoY get to kill the named drakes. SoY gets to have them ganked at will&quot; then I could see your reason for indignation. Since the agreement is obviously fair to those on the rotation, get on the rotation or stop the whining. In the instance that you do get on the rotation, it begins to work in your advantage. In the instance that your guild never gets on the Dozekar rotation, than it is a moot point: what people do with the items from the named drakes is not an issue for you, since you will never be able to finish the quest. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
See when it was only the top 2-3 guilds doing it its easy to make a gentlemans agreement because they both made out, now that more guilds are doing it, they have to once again change the rules to suit them best.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Oh, hey, here's a newsflash... this 'change' is the written convention of the gentleman's agreement. That means that *shock* there was no change, except to tell people about it in a public way. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
If you want compliance, present it and deal with it properly, dont just make some last minute changes to cover your own asses to try and show that you are right.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Present it to who exactly? You? Me? <br>
<br>
Why? So we can bicker about the Dozekar rotation, a rotation that we havn't earned a place on yet? <br>
<br>
Yeah, that sounds fair. Oh wait, no it doesn't. <br>
<br>
The bottom line is fairly easy: The rotations are conventions. If you feel so strongly that they are evil and wrong, you are not bound by any rule of the game in an enforceable way to follow them. No one will stop you in any way from taking any and all the named drakes if that is your desire. You can at will, ignore any and all rotations on this server.<br>
<br>
The fact that people usually don't violate those conventions suggests to me that the people who feel they are horrible and wrong and unjust number in a minority so small, that they do not even have the numbers requisite to form a guild strong enough to actually kill one of the rotation mobs. <br>
<br>
That suits me just fine. Let the misfits go FFA on the frenzied ghoul while guilds of at least semi-mature people work within the community to advance and attempt new things. <br>
