Before you flame at me on this please read.<br>
<br>
There is a growing tension with the 40 planeable toons limitation.  It is casuing people to attempt things that will cause us all chaos and so far the number 40 seems arbitrary.<br>
<br>
At the request of my Guilds Leadership I am bringing this up.  It ahs been posted many times and we all get to see Bogfathers snide remarks to it.  <br>
<br>
Well, then vote it.  Just vote it.  Sweet and simple.  You will get to vote it every few months one way or the other but if there is a vote it quiets the &quot;Eubers are holding us down&quot; bullshit.<br>
<br>
Bots/Tindi  I want you to consider this. People blame YOU for &quot;holding the small man down&quot;.  I DO NOT agree with this.  Before I really LEARNED what the RTA systems were I fell into that same trap.  After I READ AND LEARNED I realize that this is a pretty good system.<br>
<br>
So there comes this issue.  This number.  40 (why not 42 then I would know the reference).  40 toons at 46.  Funny though we admit freely that 20 at 56 would be more powerful.  At 46 there are plenty of mobs I cannot even hit that at 56 I would make a pretty good dent into.  ANd when a guild has a dozen or so at 63 or better then you got a true raiding force already.<br>
<br>
That all said I have a few options I wish you to honestly consider.  To debate and to vote on.  As Brigade would have a conflict of interest on this vote I will abstain (except for a tie LOL).<br>
<br>
1. Reduce number to 35.<br>
2. Reduce number to 30.<br>
3. Allow for toons over 60 to count as 2 for the original 40 number.<br>
4. Leave things alone.<br>
<br>
If I were voting I would go for option 3.  It is not asking the admins too much extra when doing the 40 toons count and this would go a long way towards eliminating that &quot;Big Dogs holding the little man down&quot; chant.<br>
<br>
I welcome your thoughts.  Please, this is very important to me.<br>

Looking at November, there are 15 out of the 30 days with no reservations at all.<br>
<br>
The second thing to consider is that BotS, NB, TL, FK, ED, LoM, VoF and the other &quot;uber&quot; guilds do not even reserve Sky, Hate or Fear, or even go to them on free days.  <br>
<br>
The third thing to consider is that it's easy for the Admins to look at a guild Roster and count 40 over 46.  Plain and simple.  <br>

Trully I do...  <br>
<br>
1. The issue is for Calendar is that weekends are almost always tied up.  For my guild, we are mostly old farts with real jobs and weekday raids are impossible as we are split between 8 time zones.  We have to be able to get weekend access due to these items.  It is very diffcult to arrange that as it is.<br>
<br>
2. I did not say I had the perception on the 7 top guilds.  I said it is perceived.  I respect the top guilds a great deal.  I am trying to make other people see that.<br>
<br>
3. I tired to allow for a simpler concept with option 3 than I had done before.  I had suggested a progressive scale.  Here we are talking just two tiers. 46 and 60.  46 counts 1 - 60 counts 2.  Honestly it would be easier to count 20 levels 60's than 40 46's would it not.  LOL.<br>
<br>
I am still asking that people debate and vote it.  I do not beleive we get dozens of new Calendar Posting requests each week now and I doubt this would open any great floodgate. <p>Mixyplix Targeth<br>

I still remember going to Fear and Hate the very first time. It was incredible.<br>
I also remember that losing a corpse PERMANENTLY and thus losing all your gear PERMANENTLY in one of those planes, was a real threat and horrified lots of people and prevented them from going there. It was a VERY realistic scene to never ever see your corpse back.<br>
This is one of the reasons that the number of 40 (yes a fairly random number) was set back then.<br>
With the currently available equipment I think 30 planes able toons would be very well able to raid those planes. Planes able being: Characters ranging from level 46 - 50.<br>
If they are higher level and well equipped 60+ toons, then 6 - 12 people can break in and hold the planes succesfully. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kenau Kamikaze, Coercer of VoF ,  Levlenna, Archon of VoF.

<br>
We finally settled on a formal alliance with Mirth to do this.<br>
<br>
I know the number seems arbitrary, but it is a real ceiling. The reality is, you are never going to have 100% attendance at a raid, no matter what the level. A percentage will not be there.<br>
<br>
There is more than just numbers, after you pass 40 planable toons. You have a percentage of people in all classes, and some leadership types, etc... I have seen no evidence that level effects that. Number of members does.<br>
<br>
Having said that I am inclined to agree with Mixy, that lowering the number might be a good idea, now.<br>

I second the call for a vote on it. <p>Shariona Seerkin Circle of Virtue<br>

<br>
I know even in my own guild though, we know our limitations.  Heh, we're not going back to PoFear for a while *again, thanks KoO for the rescue!!*.  When we get some more levels and gear, we are going back, thats for sure.  <br>

Anyways, I agree that it should be more like 30-35 people for planable status, given that teir 2 PoP gear is as close as your local bazaar vendor.<br>

When DHG (then allied with RN under GotR alliance) first got the numbers together for plane reservation we were quite happy and scheduled a Fear Raid.  When our day came we were quite humbled.  We did the standard first attempt of going in and wiping, then several attempts at CR left multiple corpses for some.  Then rescued by one group from a guild farther in progression.  <br>
<br>
The post prior to mine is also an example of this very thing.  They have the numbers but aren't going back yet because it got ugly.  I can totally relate to that feeling.  I still don't like Fear because of those early memories heh.<br>
<br>
This day DHG can go in with one group, and even had occasion to return the favor twice (to different guilds than rescued us of course).  Both rescues we did were comprised of reserving entities I believe.<br>
<br>
So the fact remains that while many guilds CAN go in with one group and not even break a sweat, for others just reaching that point in progression that arbitrary number is not enough to avoid the possiblity of &quot;a rescue&quot;.   Which, IIRC, was one of the reasons for the number.<br>
<br>
If the current reservation system was keeping people that can go up as a smaller entity out of the planes I would entertain some kind of a change, but currently that is not the case.  If someone wants to go up as a group there are a LOT of unreserved days to do this.  The reservations primarily help those that are at the point in progression where those planes are challenging and they need maximum attendance.  It would seem that beyond CT, any guild/alliance that can one/two group fear only goes there for specific drops and is not really &quot;farming&quot; fear hence no real use of the reservation system would be used.  <br>
<br>
And I'm curious as to what things are &quot;going to happen&quot; as eluded to in the first post in thread.<br>
<br>
Kathartic<br>
<br>
PS, this is not an official vote for DHG as this looked much more like a &quot;comment&quot; thread than a vote thread.  My apologies if I'm wrong in that regard.<br>

I really would prefer to not air internal guild dirty laundry.<br>
<br>
This I feel I can say.  May of my guild are chaffing at this.  We have an entire crew of 65 toons that do not want to split off to a bigger guild and feel they can do these planar raids.<br>
<br>
It can be a guild breaking item and I would rathr see Brigade suffer from a major CR nightmare one day than fall to peices do to an inability to get an arbitray number.<br>
<br>
But as I see the rules I can go to Fear and get my ass handed to me anytime I want until I become a posting entity.  And I am sure we will.  Who knows, maybe I will post the date so people can come watch the fireworks and have a good laugh.  But, maybe we will survive.  The guild is tight crew and have gotten things down pretty good.  The last few raids have only seen ME get killed (I am pretty low compared to teh rest of the leaders being level 48 now so I tend to get picked on by mobs.)<br>
Anyway, I respect people's decision either way.  I am here to plea a case and ask for a fair vote.  If the &quot;7 eubers&quot; fvery the only ones that said NO then I would be hard pressed to defend RTA against people that are not happy with it.<br>
<br>
The C4 BS is a sympton of this in my opinion.  There is a fair amount of resentment.  I am a bit of a hard ass only rescues.  You get your ass into the zone then YOU get it out.  If someone wants to help great.  <br>
<br>
Guys you vote what you feel is right.  If you think that 40 toons over 46 is a legitimate number then great.  I liked the 60+ counts 2 as that does not allow a guild of 35 47's to get in Fear.  They woudl get whiped out EASY.  20 people above 60 propbably would crack that zone fairly easily.<br>
<br>
That is my feelings. <p>Mixyplix Targeth<br>

Even if you have 20 65 players.. the question is are all 65 going to be on at the time of the raid.  We have well over 50 planeable toons.. yet the most we have had at a raid is 30+.  RL always interferes, and the other thing is with (as an example) if of those 20 is 2 clerics and 1 enchy...say the clerics can't log in..ur done for the day.  Honestly fear can be handled easily, but the aggro range is still insane so the break in is usually the only &quot;hard&quot; part of the entire zone..the way hate has been changed...you would have to purposefully pull a train to wipe anyone out.  As for sky: anyone can handle islands 1 and 2: 3 and 4 get a little tougher; 5,6,7 all need a good raiding party to handle (namely a couple of good, hi level enchy's).   <p>You go ahead of me, we let you die.<br>

If you have one solid high level group that can do rescues, then you should be ok with 35.<br>
I think the 4 selections will leave us with too large a distribution of votes to come to a consensus.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. 40 members whose levels are 46+ or 35 planable members, if at least 6 of those members are 60+.<br>
<br>
2. No change to current posting requirements<br>

It is a simpler item for the admins than what I had originaly and it still looks at teh realities.<br>
<br>
The odd part for us is that we can drag whole groups of 63 and above but do not have the requisit 40 toons at 46.<br>
<br>
When a raid is called by us the full set of the highenders is not the issue.<br>
<br>
Given the chane I woudl go with number 1, obviously.<br>
<br>
I am hearing a feelign that a formal vote is warranted.  Some wil vote against some for.  What woudl it take to get this to a formal vote?  The conversation is good.  Can we move this to more action or do we need to leave it to discussion a bit longer? <p>Mixyplix Targeth<br>

Nycah said:<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
The third thing to consider is that it's easy for the Admins to look at a guild Roster and count 40 over 46. Plain and simple.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Even my compromise mean they have to first count 6 over 60, and then count determine whether teh guild need 35 or 40 over 46.<br>
<br>
So even my suggestion means more work for the admins. If they can live with that possibility, then I will be happy to call the vote. <p>Shariona Seerkin    Cleric<br>

<br>
Well perhaps we will.<br>
<br>
The player make-up on The Rathe today is different than it was 4 years ago.  <br>
<br>
4 years ago, most guilds had a large percentage of new players in their first guild.<br>
<br>
Today most guilds are made up largly of experienced players with a few new players.<br>
<br>
4 years ago the best gear in the game was to be found in the planes.<br>
<br>
Today most guilds go into those calendar planes with better gear from UP or other new zones.<br>
<br>
4 years ago, the old planes were the high end of the game.<br>
<br>
Today mid level guilds are entering the planes, but most players in those guilds have already been there.<br>
<br>
4 years ago, level 65 did not exist.<br>
<br>
Today a group of 60+ can probably survive in any of the calendar planes.<br>
<br>
4 years ago it took at least 35 players to survive a raid in the planes.<br>
<br>
Todays guilds are less likely to wipe out the first foray in to any of the calendar planes with half that number.<br>
<br>
Are there a lot more small guilds wanting in, yes.<br>
<br>
Is it right to keep them from being posting entities on the basis of number, just because<br>
“that is the way we have always done it”?<br>

<br>
That said, it still would take a vote, which obviously has at least some backing to do; I would suggest finalizing a wording and setting it out in a way that is straightforward (I found out the hard way the problems of a misworded but well intended addendum) and put it in a seperate thread for an official yes/no/option 1/2/3/4/5/6 etc vote only. This discussion however, is good, and might have some life left in it. <br>
<br>
The differance between 40 level 46 and 35 level 46 with 5 level 60+ is not *that* large; I might suggest something to the end of, say, 40 people 46 plus, or 30 if they're all 60+, as a balance. Now, having said that, I've been in groups of 63+ that single group'd fear to recover a body or three, but I've also seen literally over a hundred corpses in fear at the same time from a raid turned corpse run gone bad. <br>
<br>
Whatever end is ratified by vote, I know the admins will assist on definately, and any guild not getting posting privildges via the regular 40 people 46+, can email me directly with their roster and comments after/if a change goes in, so as to take that aspect on myself (seeing how I do jack all around here but postulate on rules meaning and post naked pictures to annoy Nyca in the admin forum). (satire).<br>

<br>
Well the difference between a guild dump and a roster, most rosters can be delineated by players.<br>
<br>
I thought the rules implied players, with the idea &quot;most&quot; people do not 2 box, excepting Thudd's of course.<br>
<br>
The reason I bring that up, is almost all of our planable folks have at least 3 other alts that are also planable<br>
<br>
So are you counting toons 46+ or players with toons over 46+.<br>
<br>
Our guild can if we brought everyone bring maybe 20 to a raid, 35 if the those who are somewhat inactive show, ussually is around 18 with a couple of folks 2 boxing.<br>
If on the other hand you count alts and inactives, we probably have somewhere around 100 planable toons.<br>
<br>
We assumed players, not toons when we applied as a alliance.<br>

With <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>one</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> &quot;Main&quot; toon 46 or over.<br>
<br>
When the rules were first postulated and implemented,alts were not the norm, and 2-boxing was way in the future.<br>
<br>
So if a Roster had, for instance, Nyca (wiz 46) and Nycah (bard 4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , they would have been 2 discrete characters played by 2 different people, counting as 2 towards the 40 46+ to post.<br>
<br>
So, herein lies the problem of changing the rules from 40 level 46+.  Should it be changed to 30 if 10 of the toons are 60+, or 20 if all players are 65, except on Tuesday, when players 50 + count as 2, except when they count as 1, if they're a 2-boxed alt? <br>
<br>
The simpler a rule is, the easier it is to follow.  The more complicated a rule gets, the easier it is to find loopholes.<br>
<br>
