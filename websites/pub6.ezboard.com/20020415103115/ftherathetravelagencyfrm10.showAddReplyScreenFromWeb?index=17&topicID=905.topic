the point is if you can't do it notify the next guild in line so they can go.  One purpose of the rotation besides the obvious bickering is to maximize mobs kills.<br>
<br>
Also without out a penal system why have rules?<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
You, &quot;Sir I didn't mean to run that red light.&quot;<br>
<br>
Officer, &quot;Oh you didn't mean too?  OK I understand just don't do it again, k?&quot;<br>

When we have a utopian society the above will happen all the time.  So that means never.<br>

Yes, going over by a few minutes is understandable. Going over by several hours I can't explain why and should be worked out by a civil agreement between the parties involved. But a penal system will cause more static than already exist. Someone had stated once before that if such a thing would be instated than other guilds will be counting the minutes to make sure guild X has accomplished there goal in such set time or pass. We are all smart enough to know that no matter what type of communications you have with guild X static will always exist between guilds, it will never change. It's obvious that many guilds can't stand each other. Instead of a civil  agreement the penal system will just give guild X and guild Y another way to get at each other’s throats. It's just going to open a whole new can of worms IMO. Guilds such as the one I favor to be in might not be on all the rotations, but I can assure you that once we do start doing more things more people will resent us like others do to high-powered guilds on the server. I by all means wish there was a civil system to handle situations such as these. You can only wish for so much though. Matters like what happened here should be resolved in tells and an agreement should be made such as giving up the next rot etc. I will guarantee that if the system is set in place people are going to start abusing it. <p>Volitile Spinaltap VoF

If a guild goes past the 24 hours, go kill the mob they missed.  There is NO reason a guildleader can't get a real good idea of whether or not his guild has too much on its plate.  It's also common sense to pass if you're going to miss it, thus freeing that mob up for someone else.<br>
<br>
SOT had CT, and passed it to us, knowing that CT/KT/NToV/Sleepers was more than they could do.  I don't know why they didn't pass on KT as well, since if I were Shei, the singlemost important rotation for me would be a FULL N ToV rotation.<br>
<br>
Arbitrary punishments lead to spying and blame-laying which doesn't fix the problem.  I know both Tindi and NB had an occasion each where we had problems getting Keeper, Doze, and Named all in one night (server hiccups) - in an arbitrary system, we both would have needed to be &quot;punished&quot;.  Instead, we worked it out, and as luck would have it, we've both been able to show each other that same level of leniency.  True this is in a rotation that only has 2 guilds, but I hope you see my point.<br>
<br>
Making a clause that punishes someone for killing a mob after the 24hours makes little sense to me and only complicates matters.  Do we go 2 times or three times before Guild X gets to go, and how many guilds are in the rotation, etc etc.  <br>
<br>
Here is a concrete example.  Trakanon is on rotation, but I can assure you, while BOTS, SoT, Tindi and NB all would like to take their turn, there are more important rotations on patch day.  I'm not passing Keeper and Doze on patch day to get Trak - not gonna do it.  So I pass, SoT passes, Tindi passes - everyone passes on Trak.  NB goes down to kill him on day 2, after our 24 hours are up - we get punished by not being allowed to kill him for the next two rotations?  /boggle.<br>
<br>
I agree if people are going to go for a new mob, and avoid their rotation mobs, they need to pass if they have a good inclination that it will be more than they can handle.  To me that is beyond self-evident.  If you can't kill everything on your plate, then let someone else go for it.  I'm a bit naive in that I count on people to be aboveboard and be fair.  I also know this isn't always the case, but I don't see the logic in complicating a system to address a single &quot;offender&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I've always been really good about NB passing when we need to, so its not a matter of concern about us being &quot;punished&quot; - but about complicating my planning to deal with this.  Things work best when I can plan a week ahead and just count on X Guild killing Mob Y on certain times.  Having to factor in mandatory skippings, and multiple ones at that is a problem.  What is less a problem is dealing with them &quot;forcibly&quot; passing and picking the mob up the next day.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I don't like forced &quot;skips&quot;, and I refuse to accept &quot;double&quot; or worse &quot;skips&quot;, as they impact my planning too much and don't seem fair to me.  Being fair shouldn't be that hard, let's all work to make our server a better place to play on. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

<br>
If you pay your bills late, the company you owe losing money, and in general you pay a late penalty to offset this loss.  This penalty is in place so that the company does not have to resort to taking you to court and suing you for breach of contract.<br>
<br>
When you play a sport, and your team intentionally injures another player outside the rules, you suffer a penalty.  This prevents the sport from dissolving completely into one huge free for all.<br>
<br>
When you break a rotation agreement, the agreement has been broken. (period)<br>
<br>
Without penalties, there are only 3 options available when a guild violates an agreement.<br>
<br>
1. Throw the agreement out completely.<br>
2. Ignore the infraction. (bend over and take it)<br>
3. Retaliate by violating the agreement. (defeats the purpose of the agreement)<br>
<br>
That is why penalties are needed, they provide a level of fault tolerance within the agreement.  No one is perfect, so why not design the rotation agreements to handle these problems?<br>
<br>
When one guild violates an agreement, they benefit while the other guilds suffer.  This only provides incentive for more abuse of the agreement.<br>
<br>
That is why their is a need for penalties.  With penalties, the guild violating the agreement suffers for their mistake, instead of benefiting.<br>
<br>
Penalties are not about pointing fingers and laying blame, they are about preserving the order of player made agreements, and keeping them from being them thrown out completely.<br>
<br>
If you think the penalties I proposed are too severe, propose alternatives, that is what this thread is about.  I don't care if  you hate me, in fact I encourage it.  But don't let that stand in the way of reason.<br>
<br>
If we can't agree on penalties, then I can tell you:<br>
<br>
1. I will not bend over and take abuses.<br>
2. I will retaliate by abusing the system in turn.<br>
3. The rotation agreements will be thrown out.<br>
<br>
If you hate me so much that you are willing to suffer to see me suffer, then power to you.  Cut off your nose to spite you face.<br>
<br>
Rotations benefit everyone.  Penalties help keep rotations alive.<br>

<br>
Why not a rule that states something like this:<br>
<br>
From the moment the mob spawns (or you are notified that the prior guild is passing) you have 24 hours to kill that mob or pass to the next guild.  After 24 hours the mob automatically passes to the next guild.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
If the same group leaves the same mob up every time, then odds are good they will be flamed here nonstop anyway.  If they do it enough, they will be ignored and effectively be out of the rotation anyway.  No reason to make it more complicated than it should be.<br>
<br>
It takes no effort to keep the next guild in the rotation informed of your plans.  Its a friendly agreement anyway. <p><center><table border=0 background="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/backg.gif"><TR><TD><TABLE border=0

I agree .. and don't ... the big problem is what happened with KT the other day .. SoT's 24 hours were up, so what happens if Tindi or Bots went in to rightfully take KT cause the 24 hours are up ... sot was still there .. this would have caused much havoc.    Havoc is what we are trying to prevent.<br>
<br>
Merloc is postiong his ideas on penelties, in no way is he god of the server and saying what he says goes.  He is giving out ideas in hopes everyone agrees on something.   So if you don't agree with Merloc, post your own thoughts ... again, these rotations are to benifit everyone on the rotation.  <br>
<br>
Some people are saying that punishment is wrong .. well okay, but if everyone agrees to a certian 'punishment' then it isn't so bad.     Yes I know its hard to get *everyone* to agree 100% ... but we are all civilized enough people who can come to agreements, I am sure. <p><CENTER>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  If we can't agree on penalties, then I can tell you:<br>

<br>
What does happen when such set penalty system does get ignored? Guilds start racing for mobs again? <br>
I still think a penalty system encourages laziness. Guilds should be more responsible on keeping track of what they are up for as part of the rotation system as to waiting to be notified. Keep at least some honor in telling the next guild what is going on if not the next guild can always send a tell to the prior guild asking what the status is on mob X. It's a two lane highway. Only thing that scares me is if people do start getting fed up like the above quote statement we will be back to square one, no system at all. Almost sounds like this is the goal intended.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Oh yeah lets not forget either. Euro guilds are much stronger today than a year ago capable of setting up on average 6 hours prior to state side guilds. Ignoring the rot system might actually leave you less to play with Merloc. I don't speak on behalf of my guild on this matter its just my opinion. My Air force recruiter told me 5 years ago that once I sign up to be careful what I ask for. I believe this goes for everything and we should all do the same.<br>

Try the FFA route.  I was told by a GM in RL that the Rathe has less /petitions than any other server because of the RTA board.<br>

Say Guild A has KT ,Yeli and CT. Guild B has NToV ,ST and Dain. <br>
<br>
While Guild B is clearing NToV they get a /tell from Guild A officer saying &quot;we pass KT as we want to kill Yeli and CT&quot; .Guild B now has time to fnish the NToV clearing ,go to ST and clear then the following day within their 24 hours go to Dain and since Guild A didnt pass until 12 hours into their time , KT killing has been given an extension well beyond the first 24 hours thus giving Guild B 36 to kill all thier mobs.<br>
<br>
Now say because of the recent late killing of KT the rot is bumped around and bots get next ,then TL then bots again then TL. What if those said guilds have  other rotations fall on those extra kt's and are pushed for time again? Say they pass. Is it passed to SoT? They are out of loop for punishment but the next in line is bots which means bots could get ntov yeli kt ct dain all in one day BUT theres no time to do all that so they pass one of their mobs to the next guild. Gets very confusing very fast.(I'm sure ssssomeone with a higher IQ than me will post to correct my post but you get my drift)<br>
<br>
You and we are not the law.We are all equal.We pay same money. Yes agreements are broken .If the people making them cant agree on the  forfeit when that agreement is broken then how can there be an agreement? Also breaking an agreement  because your guild has had multi deaths and the crowd are baying for blood does not constitute lying. It does mean an agreement was broken BUT as i said if no arrangement that ALL parties agree to on punishment has been made then it kinda sets the broken agreement asque.<br>
<br>
I would never IRL  sign a piece of paper stating yes i will do x ,y , &amp; z or else and leave that or else up to the crowd. I would want the failure penalty to be made know to me before hand. There might have been a general  assumtion that there was an agreement  on the punishment but this thread proves there wasnt.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is not N Ireland.Bots are not the Uk Gov.SoT are not the IRA. This is a game and we should lighten up a little ingame. Running around taking pictures of other guilds doing their mobs is kinda lame really lol. Why did it matter that guild A killed fippy using a tactic that guild B didnt like ? I bet i drive my car far faster than  you might like and certainly faster than law states but this doesnt make me  a liar,retard or deserve to be told to kill myself. <br>
<br>
We should be all cheering when Guild A or B kill a certain mob and get certain loot and have beaten what the evil Darkhand of VI set out for us. <br>
<br>
SoL is round the corner and I dont want to think we cant  sort out the mobs up there too.<br>
<br>
If there is a problem with a rot or  a guild  messing up rot or  a guild killing a mob in a way that you dont like ,then why not /tell the guild leaders/officers etc? It smacks of cowardice really. I havent and never have said something on the boards that i wouldnt say to you in tells.<br>
<br>
Anyway i think if a guild fails to kill their mob within 33 min 23 secs of spawning that the said guild  gives me all their ph4t l00ts !<br>
<br>
(BTW i really kinda feel that these agreements are gentlemens agreements which means  there is no REAL punishment just  broken trust ,disgust ,sadness and  perhaps a shake of the head of the general popution of the rathe)<br>
<br>
This is not a flame please dont read it as such.Its just my feelings with the the vegatables <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have to ask, for clarity more or less...<br>
<br>
What ever happened to the first guild there, setting up to kill XYZ mob, gets it?<br>
<br>
Good Lord! I can see the utter frustration that is/will be evolving from all the *rotation schedules and keeping up with who is up for what, when and how many...then we throw in the guild A /passed on mob V so guild B now has 4 rot mobs but they get 14 more hours for mob V since they were told late and AAAAAAAAAAAGRRRRRRRGGGGG....<br>

The first guild there setting up and getting wont work due to time zone difference.  See Euros and Asians have an advantage due to logging on when most Americans are asleep.  An since they are foreigners they have no restraint and are greedy by nature since their countries suck and they have ugly women.  So they attempt to make themselves feel better by taking spawns early.<br>
<br>
Ok seriously tho,<br>
<br>
Rotations are good for peace and eliminate time zone advantages.  This can be done peacefully without name calling and racial slurring.  We are still trying to figure out how tho.<br>
<br>
We do need to try the KISS princaple and just keep it as simple as possible and realize that if guilds are passing cus they want to do something else that week...the world does not end cus a mob doesnt get killed.  Does not having KT loot flow into the game one week really matter that much?  I think not.<br>
<br>
Until each side decides to let go of the past...stop worrying that a time or two they may get taken advantage of..and stop trying to be the Donald Trump of Spawn Negotiations...then this will be like pissing in the wind.<br>
<br>
Since it is just a game..if your guild comes out on the short end once in a while...deal with it. Noone dies..eventually all guilds will get shorted due to patches etc. <p><p><BR><center>
