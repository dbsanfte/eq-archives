This just makes me sick.  How can you people care so little about the children in the world?  Whether or not you want to admit it, it does take the village to raise the child.  You parents can not watch a child 24 hours a day 7 days a week no matter how great you are.<br>
<br>
Growing up I had my parents like everybody else.  As long as I can remember they were divorced.  Did that make them bad parents, no.  They did the best they could but they werent always there for me.<br>
<br>
But I also had my friends parents teaching me values.  I had my Grandparents teaching me their ages of wisdom.  I had my teachers trying to mold me into a citizen and now because of it I to am a teacher and hope to pass on morals and ideals to the children.<br>
<br>
Yes, the parents have the greatest responcibility to the children.  But we all have that responcibility also.  Are you so cold hearted that you wouldnt want people looking after your children?  That others shouldnt protect your children from the horros of the world and let them be children? <p><image src="http://endorean.org/guild/signature/jushiro.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udrainer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drainer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Group 9</span><br>  Posts: 503<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/14/01 12:06:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm not here to babysit your @#%$ kids</span><hr size=1> Not too sure Jubershiro. <br>

I'm 22 and have 2 kids.  I live in an apartment with them and my wife.  I drive a piece of @#%$ to work every day.  They're 1.5 years apart from each other.  They were both born on state money.  I now pay for their health insurance because I can afford to.  It's not because I'm stupid; I make a lot of money for a 22 year old.<br>
<br>
BTW, we also used the WIC system (Women, Infants, and Children) to help supply food for them and us.  That's part of the welfare system.<br>
<br>
GUESS I AM A PIECE OF @#%$!!<br>
<br>
Mommy and Daddy didn't put me through college, though.  I was thrown out on my own right at 18.  Heh, I wasn't even sure how the @#%$ I was going to stay alive or where I was going to live for a good while.<br>
<br>
You know what, though?  Thanks.  You're the kind of person I think of in my head when I'm striving to be more than I already am.  You make me feel like @#%$, and I feel the need to persevere so that I can feel better about being such a piece of @#%$.<br>

I love my 2 daughters.  Kids are innocent, IMO.

I would never let my kid read this message board, because of stupid people like you, that dont give a crap about other people and especially children in what they read cause you know there are plenty of children playing this game and reading these boards. So my advise to you is maybe look in the mirror, get off the computer and go to the nearest daycare and spend a day with all those wonderful kids that have a future and need to be shown good from bad to make there lives a lot more happier.

<br>
And to clarify something for you, children are a product of how they are raised by their primary care givers (minus those kids that are unfortunate enough to have screws loose to begin with). Peoples kids I know, I watch what they do and correct them, when I'm around them. Every child in the world? Can't possibly do it, and besides what's wrong with their parents watching them? They are the ones that decided to have the children not me.<br>
<br>
Does this mean I turn my back on a child in need standing in front of me, no. Just means I'm not going to willing do a parents job for them, so they don't have to. <br>

And, just when you've done everything you can to raise your children, they get exposed to bad behavior at school.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, I truly think the percentage of good parents is shrinking.  People just aren't willing to make the sacrafices it takes to be a good parent.  My daughter is in private school and I see a lot of spoilded children or parents so wrapped up in themselves, they put their children last and not first.

<br>
You are trying to support your kids and I salute you for it. There are others who grew up on state aid and have no plans other then raising their own families the same way. Helping is very different from paying for a persons entire life and the lives of the children the females birth just to make their government check fatter. <br>
<br>
If you cannot afford one child, why the hell would you have another and another and another and another? That is what I disagree with. It was not my intention to make you feel bad about yourself Cobee. Anyone who is at least trying to support their children deserves some respect <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Unless of course you also think that everyone around your children should pretend that the world is a happy shiny place that it is not and does not say anything that you consider offensive.

<br>
Those of you that are doing the whole &quot;raise your own kids, not my responsibility to have to moderate my own actions&quot; bit, let me suggest you actually have a child of your own before you have the insolence to even think about criticizing other parents.  You have no idea what raising a child is like.  No matter how vigilant you are, no matter how much you protect them, they are going to do things you don't want them to do because it is human nature.  They are going to be exposed to things you don't want them to be exposed to.  There's only so much a parent can control.  Keep them off the internet?  Sure, that works.  To an extent.  Then you get kids like I was, the ones that manage to figure out how to sneak through your password protection, deactivate your CyberNanny (or whatever) program, and look at whatever they want to anyway while you should both be asleep.<br>
<br>
Of course, on the same note, I've never sheltered my child from much of anything.  I know how I was, and I know that i found out about what life was really like in a much more painful and difficult way than most kids did because I didn't have anyone there to explain it, or to show me the good things in life.  My daughter knows the darker side of life, and she knows how horrible humans can be to others.  She also knows that life isn't all ugliness and filth, that there's good things too.  Interestingly enough, she's more well adjusted in general than a lot of other kids I know.  &lt;shrug&gt;  So who's to really say whether it's good or bad to be exposed to it?<br>

  Any person over the age of 7 that is not mentally challenged is 100% capable of making intelligent decisions for themselves for ~most~ issues.  Kids know what is right and wrong, you can blame society and their parents as much as you want for their upbringing, it boils down to the fact that kids aren't as stupid as we make them out to be at times.<br>
