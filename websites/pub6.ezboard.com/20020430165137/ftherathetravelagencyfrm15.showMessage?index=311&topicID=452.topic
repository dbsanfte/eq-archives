I don't blame NB or any guild for being interested in this thread. It effects the server as a whole. I find it funny that there was no apology untill Dwallyn posted the logs that showed just how bad this incident really was, and other than a select few in SoT being apologetic most are still trying to take attention away from the matter at hand.<br>

It may be wrong to judge a person by the tag over their heads... but even so, it happens.  The game has two currencies.. plat, and reputation.<br>
<br>
The actions of individuals wearing a tag are the actions by which that tag is judged.  And so, in my view, each member is personally responsible for building the reputation of their guild, by acts of kindness, fairness, etc.  And also, it is in the best interest of members to speak up against things which they know are wrong, and would tear down the reputation of their guild.  You can't just throw up your hands and be led.<br>
<br>
In the end, what's done is done.  All that really matters is that amends are made to Trompen, and that this doesn't happen again.<br>

<br>
Sorry, I was thinking of the Ring of Dragons CR on 3/9/02.  Thundaron and co were organizing, and he sent me a tell &quot;Grats on CR&quot; or something to that effect when you all left, and Slinkity made a mistell from /g into /ooc that kinda embarassed her (I'm not going into what it was, just want to refresh memories).  Ring of Dragons (Daia, the raid leader) asked for NB help, one other guild in the tri-guild alliance asked SoT.  She chose us since we didn't insist on taking over the raid for a CT kill (like you all did to Far Seekers).  We CRed, resed, and left.  You went in on Sunday and killed him, getting a cloak and choker.<br>
<br>
If you indeed CRed DFL as you describe, I applaud you.  Can you try and get the rest of SoT to do more of those and less of the RoD and Far Seeker-type CRs?  You are someone who has (over the last three years) gained my respect regardless of your tag, and I would point out as an exception, rather than the rule for SoT leadership.<br>
<br>
Also, for the record, every time I have mentioned NB's Ragefire stance, I have been very clear on us not KSing or campstealing.  Every time.  We don't support Nycah's list, but we do support the Sol B gentleman's agreement, and always have.  Using that as your reasoning for KSing Trompen is not based on anything I have posted about our stance.<br>
<br>
Malidar,<br>
<br>
The reason I keep posting is people keep engaging me in a dialogue or trying to refute important points.  NB cares a lot about this situation, because this is how you have been treating us and others for over 18 months with one exception (/bow Tzuten re Zland heads up).  Until now, we have seen your impressive PR machine attempt to derail and confuse the issues brought here against your guild on a continuous basis and even now try and paint this as a one-off &quot;mistake&quot;.  If all you can do is call me a lamer for making very valid points - so be it.  Show your maturity.  /sarcastic salute <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

You as a guild are jerks.  Individually, many of you may be fine people, but as a part of SoT, you contribute to being the lowest guild on the Rathe.  Largely due to the misguided leadership you have (not just Shei), but for whatever reason, you need to look at yourselves and what you're doing wrong instead of bitching and whining about the rest of us letting you know what fuqwits you are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufalconusdawnlight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falconus Dawnlight</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indy Raid Organizer</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/25/02 2:24:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Why is that Malidar? cos i bring to you hard truth? and for that i must be an idiot? rofl too funny.<br>

<br>
This doesn't just apply between Trompen and SoT.  This is a community issue, if this happens once.. it becomes all the easier to happen again.. and I don't just mean any specific guild. (No, I am NOT saying SoT will do it again.. I am saying that once something occurs.. it becomes 10x easier for someone else to rationalize)<br>
<br>
I think most of the guilds and folks on the Rathe are fairly proud of the low conflict environment that we've all tried to work towards... call it &quot;carebear&quot;.. or whatever.. but it's certainly more enjoyable from what I've seen.<br>
<br>
This wasn't some uber mob that only two or three guilds are competing for.. this was something that a large amount of guilds on the server compete for.  Right or wrong, apology or no apology.. this affected the whole community.<br>
<br>
That said, hopefully things will settle down some.  Imo, SoT leadership lost some credibility here with most guilds. It is going to take some time for that to heal.  My advice is to really think hard about how you handle things like this in the future... BEFORE any mobs die.<br>

<br>
I have to disagree here. Yes, what SoT did in Skyfire was not good, and it cannot be made un-done. But they DID help numerous guilds in Fear without any gain for themselves. Let me give you an example:<br>
<br>
After the Fear upgrade we, Visionaries of Fire, got wiped out at west wall. Corpses kept agro for some reason although the owners of the corpses obviously zoned after death and should have lost agro. They didn.t  I went back in with my resstick, that I am wielding thanks to SoT, but the mobs kept popping on my head where all the corpses were, so I died also.<br>
We called for help, and there they came, it WAS impressive for us, small guild, to see all those epics march in, to see how well organized they were and killed all mobs in the area. Never did they touch a mobs corpse. We got to loot them all. After all my guildies were ressed and buffed up, they left.<br>
That was pure, unselfish help.<br>
<br>
Again I say: they did wrong in Skyfire, and they know so. However they are not ALL bad and we are not ALL good. Also we, all of us, have our dark side. <p>DON'T attack that mezzed m.....

<br>
I know why you see SoT as you do, they have certainly helped you on many occasions.   The relationship between SoT and VoF is one of close friendship.  This doesn't explain why I get so many tells asking for CR from guilds all over the Rathe so they can keep their Fear Raid under their control.  Helping a friend is easy, some might say expected.  It's more generous to help those who ask, simply because they want help.  Read the post here from the Far Seeker member for his description of SoT's &quot;help&quot; - his isn't an isolated example either.  I think a tell I got from an SoT member at the 3/09 RoD CR helps explain this difference fairly well.  <br>

AnonSoT: &quot;Why are you helping if you don't get anything out of it?&quot;  <br>
(This was in response to me acknowledging we were not up for CT and thus not allowed to kill him)<br>
<br>
My Answer: &quot;There is more to the game than just loot.&quot;<br>
<br>
I respect your opinion of SoT, but I don't share it.  Just because someone is a friend of yours, doesn't mean they don't treat others poorly.  I understand your innate friendly bias of SoT, as anyone would have of a friend who has helped them.  My bias towards SoT is on the opposite spectrum - and for equally good reason. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

We had successfully cleared most of the plane, all but the Amy Temple, Terror, and CT when Thundaron decided to enter the plane although I had specifically told him we were not finished with our raid. After we died to Terror, I zoned into Fear and found close to 20 SoT members in the zone laughing about our guild wiping out. When I asked Thundaron why he had his members in zone he said there were only clerics to help with CR (which was not true, only a few were clerics). Our guild does not have a rez stick yet, so their help was appreciated although NOT necessary. I was already in the zone and fully prepared to start CR on my own. <br>
<br>
After CR they stayed and offered help in killing Terror once they found out we were going to try again. I once again told Thundaron that we had every intention of clearing the plane on our own but I accepted their help since I knew they were waiting to kill CT on the condition that they would not interfere with the rest of our raid. They pulled Terror before we were ready and killed him. Then they continued pulling the rest of the mobs in the zone. I once again sent Thundaron a tell asking him to back off and let our pullers continue with their job and he said he asked them to do just that. He then offered to have someone show our pullers how to pull the Amy Temple. This tactic consisted of pulling the entire temple and bringing it back to camp. When questioned what was going on, they laughed and said it was an AE pull. They didn't seem to care that people died, afterall they had rez sticks. <br>
<br>
At this point, our raid was ruined. Although Thundaron did apologize and he seemed sincere, it still had ruined the fun that we were having before his members came in to show off to a smaller guild. They wanted Cazic Thule and they were unwilling to wait for our guild to clear the plane using our own tactics - which although may not be as fast as SoT's they still work. <br>
<br>
I was very upset with SoT but I did not post anything here regarding the incident. Instead we learned a few things and used it as an example of what our guild will never do no matter how big we get. <br>
