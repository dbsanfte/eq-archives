last night i wanted to tag along with CB on their yeli kill. asked and was told no you can't cause RTA says, yada yada.<br>

i know it was done so that you couldn't drag a couple extra clerics with you to help them out. but come on, one warrior who just wants a faction hit?<br>

i think if you ok it with an RTA rep in game and explain your situation that exceptions should be made.<br>

moot point now, cause he's dead. guess i wait another 7 days to try and get faction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghalidsoulsaver>Ghalid Soulsaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/w/i/wilsonua/pstgif.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Legend of Marr</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/9/03 8:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1139.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Faction and First Attempt</span><hr size=1> Actually no..the exception can't be made unfortunately.

So does that mean that if they do it &quot;that one time&quot; the guild can have friends along after that encounter?<br>
Doesnt really effect me or my guild I was just wondering because it didnt make much sense to me. <br>

What happens if the guild you are going with, having never proven they can kill him, suddenly has their MT line go down and you are just &quot;one warrior wanting a faction hit&quot;, and you wind up tanking for them.  Yay, they win, but could they have without you there. . .no one will ever know.  It's impossible to know what your role there is, so its best if they kill it on their own, once, unaided, then there can be no question.<br>

As for 2box toons, I would have to say I see them the same way.  It's not a guild character, and I would question whether that guild had beaten him on their own.

It was SoY you are referring to, Karadin, but the warrior was an applicant for our guild at the time and had a temporary SoY tag for the raid (he was not part of another guild).  Statue ate our first three tanks (hey, we had never done this before) before that applicant managed to grab aggro and tank the mob for the whole 16+ minutes of the fight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roggulbuk>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><marquee>Newbie Admin!</marquee> <BR>

He was flagged SoY (temp or perm I dunno) between then and the next Statue kill, which SoY was again successful at.<br>

The point still stands, it's easy to say &quot;I'm just a dumb warrior, or bard, or whatever&quot;, but how do you differentiate who is there &quot;just for a faction hit&quot;, and who might actually play a pivotal role in a guild's victory that isn't a member.  It's best for the guild in question to do as CB did, and prove 100% upfront that they did it alone, and any time after that, can allow anyone and their brother's aunt's cousin's mother's cat get a faction hit without worry.<br>
<br>
Gromm is &quot;just a rogue&quot;, but I guarantee you, if he were at a guild's first KT or Statue or Yeli, he could make a significant difference just by sending tells or talking in raid chat, and no one would be the wiser.  Sure, he could send tells from Plane of Water, but if he isn't in the zone, he can't see the deployment of the guild, nor show them visually where to stand, where to move, etc.  And that's not counting the impressive DPS he might bring to bear were he there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roggulbuk>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><marquee>Newbie Admin!</marquee> <BR>
