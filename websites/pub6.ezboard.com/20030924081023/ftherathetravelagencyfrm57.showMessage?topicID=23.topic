Every class has the same list of &quot;General Archtype&quot; AA skills to pick from when they hit level 51.  There is some variance in what AA points players put their &quot;starting six&quot; AA toward, but almost everyone agrees that the first 3 AA points should go to &quot;Improved Natural Run Speed&quot;.  This skill increases your run speed by 30%, and is in effect at all times (unlike SOW, which can only be cast or refreshed in &quot;outdoor zones&quot;).<br>
<br>
Melee classes almost unanimousely put their next three AA points in &quot;Improved Natural Regeneration&quot;, and a great many caster classes do, as well.<br>
<br>
A better option for casters is &quot;Innate Natural Metabolism&quot;, especially if they use a mount (which EVERY caster should, since a mount is effectively a Flowing Thought VII item -- some argue higher -- in Outdoor Zones).<br>
<br>
Most players avoid the General AA that raise stats or abilities, since there are plenty of magic items that can obtained in the game to do this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Specialization of Planar Powers:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Now you've gained you're 6 AAXP, and you're ready for &quot;the good stuff&quot; -- how do you spend your points?  The secret in investing wisely is to specialize, not diversify.  You have to identify what your role in your guild or groups is.  Usually, if there are mutliple enchanters in a guild, they have special roles: Primary buffer, Crowd Control / Debuffer, etc.  If there are already high level enchanters in the guild, than those enchanters coming &quot;up through the ranks&quot; often find themselves as damage dealers (and backup to the other traditional roles).  High level enchanters who aren't guilded may fulfill a variety of these roles (depending on the group setting they find themselves in), or perhaps they are a solo specialist.<br>
<br>
Identify your speciality -- and then you can become more proficient in that speciality by focusing your AA points.  I've created six (6) categories of enchanters -- find which one you are, and then consider specializing accordingly.<br>
<br>
Debuffer / Crowd Control Specialist<br>
Group / Individual Buffer<br>
Damage Dealer<br>
Mana Preservation / Conservation<br>
God Complex<br>
Court Jester -- The Fool<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Debuffer / Crowd Control Specialist (Traditional):</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If your primary role in raid encounters is the MOB debuffer (tash / slow / cripple / weaken / DOT), then you expect that you're going to get &quot;hit&quot;.  No shame in that.  Your job is to minimize the amount of times you do get hit (by avoiding early aggro), and minimize the damage you take when you do get hit (by keeping yourself runed).  But you can't avoid the idiot melee who breaks mezz on the wrong MOB, or the early tash you HAD to get off on the mob (so the shaman could slow) would caused the MOB to come after you.  If you're primary role is Debuffer / Crowd Control, then specialize your AA in skills that will allow you to lower yourself on the MOBs hate list (spell casting subtlety), &quot;channel&quot; your casting through the melee knockbacks, increases your damage avoidance, mitigates damage and increases your hit points.  Focus on these, and you will be a more valued Debuffer / Crowd Control specialist for your guild.<br>
<br>
And when you die (because you WILL die), devote AA to abilities that will help you regain your mana faster (Gather Mana, Mental Clarity), so you can be on your feet quickly.<br>
<br>
- 55: Spell Casting Subtlety, Channeling Focus, Improved Natural Durability, Combat Stability, Mental Clarity<br>
- 59: Gather Mana<br>
- 61: Eldritch Rune, Lightening Reflexes, Innate Defense<br>
- 62: Mastery of the Past<br>
<br>
=================================<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Group / Individual Buffer:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Your primary role on guild raids is to buff the casters with KEI and haste all the tanks -- you're tapped for mana early in the event, and serve as backup crowd control as needed.  Because you are the Buff Master, you want to focus on AA that improve the duration of your buffs, and speed their casting time.<br>
<br>
- 55: Spell Casting Reinforcement, Spell Casting Deftness<br>
- 59: Mass Group Buff, Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery, Quick Buff<br>
<br>
=================================<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Damage Dealer / Nuker (also the Solo Enchanter's List):</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Often times the &quot;low level, up-and-coming&quot; enchanters take a backseat to the older enchanters in the guild when it comes to traditional enchanter roles (debuffer / crowd control / debuffer).  But they can still greatly benefit raid encounters by focusing on damage dealing aspects of their AA.  Abilities like Spell Casting Fury / Fury of Magic (to increase the chance of critical strikes), and improved charm / pet control (so your pet can help do more damage, rather than just sit there and stare over your shoulder all the time).  This is also the speciality list of the Career Solo Enchanter (yes, enchanters can solo -- quite well, in fact), along with their development of the &quot;Debuffer&quot; list..<br>
<br>
- 55: Spell Casting Fury<br>
- 59: Dire Charm<br>
- 61: Animation Empathy, Total Domination, Fury of Magic<br>
- 62: Suspended Minion<br>
<br>
=================================<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mana Preservation / Conservation:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
For any of the Core Specialities listed above, if you find yourself tapping out on mana while performing your primary role, you'll want to invest some skills in the mana preservation abilities.  These skills regenerate your mana pool more quickly, or minimize it's drain during casting.  If you die frequently (common for &quot;debuffer / crowd control&quot; roles), you'll want to focus primarily on regen -- so you can get yourself up and casting quickly after a rezz.  Buffers and Damage Dealers tend to not draw aggro as much, however, die less frequently, and benefit from Spell Casting Mastery first.<br>
<br>
- 55: Spell Casting Mastery, Mental Clarity<br>
- 59: Gather Mana<br>
- 63: Hastened Gathering<br>
<br>
=================================<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>God Complex:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
Enchanters how suffer the God Complex are a little less focused than the rest of us.  The focus on increasing various stats (that could just as easily be raised by magic items found in the game), rather than abilities.  Often times this is by purpose (if I increase my Intelligence, I can drop some of my Int gear in favor of mana gear), for some players it just seems like they rolled the dice and said, &quot;I'll pick that AA skill.&quot;  God Complex characters have usually (hopefully) completed mastery in one or more of the OTHER specialities, and now want to become &quot;god-like&quot;.  The focus on the stat and resist raising AA:<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Court Jesters - The Fool:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
These are the &quot;silly&quot; AA, marked such becuase they don't seem to have a lot of practical use in a realm of enduring breath spells / items, healing potions / spells, memorized spell lists that all exceed 52nd level, etc.  I know people are going to cry out &quot;but First Aid is IMPORTANT for the soloing enchanter.&quot;  Fine.  You're entitled to your opinion, I have mine.  First Aid is silly for an Enchanter.<br>

This is actually a very useful AA.  Get a druid to cast share wolf form on you and you then have SOW that lasts for a very very very long time.<br>
<br>
RS3 works great indoors.  But what works even better is share wolf form  =)<br>
<br>
The only downside is that wolf form is still KOS in some areas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=presstochango>Pressto Chango</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/12/03 5:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pressto.yourguild.com/pictures/pressto.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AA Specialization Lists for Enchanters</span><hr size=1> - 59: Permenant Illusion<br>

There are a few details in there I don't agree with, or feel should be alittle different, but it is a very subjective area to begin with.<br>
<br>
As a general rule, when I evaluate how useful an Alt Skill is, the two most important factors generally are:<br>
How often will I use this skill?<br>
How much of an effect will it have when I do?<br>
<br>
Skills like Gather Mana, aren't used very often, but make a huge difference when they are.  Skills like natural regen, are used every time you're not at full health, but only have a minor effect.<br>
<br>
As a fairly old enchanter (with just over 425 active days /played), I have come to respect survival over just about any other (player) skill.  All the charm and intelligence in the world isn't going to do a dead 'chanter any good.<br>
<br>
Some skills I feel are highly situational, and some are good at any time, but the two skills that I find to make the most difference to my game are: spell casting mastery and quick buff.  I'm not saying that the rest aren't good, but nothing else has had nearly as much of an impact. <br>
<br>
Spell Casting Mastery is useful anytime we cast a spell. Regardless of their role, fizzling less and using less mana is considered a &quot;good thing&quot;. This is, however, most useful for spells of your primary specialization.  Personally, I find that most of the mana I spend is used with Alteration spells, so that is what I have my spec set to, and I save a tremendous amount of mana due to SCM3.  Be it soloing, grouping, or raiding, I have alot more mana to work with. (However, if an enchanter has a role that does not involve casting spells, and then SCM3 will not help them in any way, and I usually tell them to start over.)<br>
<br>
Our 2nd most useful AA skill, in my opinion, is Quick Buff 3. This is used every time you cast a buff of any sort. Thats right. 50% faster casting of buffs. No, this isn't just a time-saver when trying to buff your group or raid (although it will do that too), but this skill is most effective when used with the Arcane Rune spell (self-only 1500 damage absorbtion spell). Quick Buff3 will take that 5.0 second cast time rune and turn it into a 2.5 second cast time rune. No other AA skill has added more to my survival than this one. I delayed in getting it, because I didn't see the value, but I wish I hadn't. Once I got it I never looked back.   <p>Tashim, 65th Enchanter<br>

<br>
I had not really put much thought into getting this aa until he suggested it. Since then I trained it up and it realyl does make a big difference. Eldritch rune is nice but often i find it not enough so a quick channel of arcane rune can really make a difference.<br>
<br>
I may not agree with his choice of spec but then we all have our favorite playstyle and Conj suits mine.<br>
