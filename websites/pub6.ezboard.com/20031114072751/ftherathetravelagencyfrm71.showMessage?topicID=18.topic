Donaldson? There were actually two &quot;Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot; series to this and I thought the first which is the Unbeliever was the best. If you liked trilogy's like the Lord of the Rings you will like the Unbeliever series. I have not met a single person who has read these and not liked them.  <br>
<br>
Book One: Lord Foul's Bane<br>
Book Two: The Illearth War<br>
Book Three: The Power that Preservers<br>
<br>
P.S. I almost forgot, you might want to have a erudite vocabulary for reading this. The first time I read it I had a dictionary at my side. <br>

I especially enjoyed how he portrayed the Giants.  You could not help falling in love with the character of Saltheart Foamfollower.  The Haruachi were maybe the biggest badasses of all time.<br>

I did like the first set of three the best (The Illearth War is my favorite book in my extensive library) but I certainly enjoyed the second set also.  The Sand Gorgons rocked.<br>

Yep, the best example of a literary anti-hero in Fantasy/Science Fiction I've ever read.<br>
<br>
If I didn't understand that the one scene when he first enters the Land was designed to set him up as an anti-hero, I think I would've put the book down there and not looked back.<br>

I was always amazed at Donaldson's expertise at portraying his &quot;Hero&quot; in such a 'Truthful&quot; light. (All my opinions btw -- I have no idea how a leper feels or what shit they have to fight everyday just to stay alive or to simply have the will to live)<br>
<br>
I never felt what Covenant did was mean or wrong. (Yes, The Lena thing at the beginning was pretty harsh).  I always bought into the idea that this is the way a leper might actually act if this crazy situation ever happened.<br>
<br>
He thought almost up to the end that this whole thing was just a altered mind fantasy that his brain had come up with to cope with his leprosy.  He always said he couldn't allow himself for even one instance to truly believe he could start feeling things again with his extremities because if he ever did and it was wrong - He would be as good as dead.<br>
<br>
He just didn't turn into your stereotypical idea of a hero.  The whole idea of The Land was such an opposite of how Covenant lived his live of Leper VSR.  The portrayal of Covenant as he has to start dealing with the fact that he can feel when he has totally comes to grips with the fact that he couldn't before is the real story of the books.<br>
<br>
In fact that was why the &quot;Creator&quot; said he chose him at the end of the first trilogy.  I think he said he needed someone that had lived with despair for so long that they wouldn't give into it but would fight back when it was forced upon them.<br>
<br>
In Short - I just totally bought into the way he acted; that it was the real way a leper would act in The Land.<br>
<br>
After eveything I have read; from Fantasy to Political - Only Dante's &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; even comes close to it in my opinion for the way it made me feel.  I always rooted for Covenant more than any other fantasy &quot;Hero&quot;.<br>
