<br>
You quoted me:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
All minority groups simply want to be treated and thought of as equals.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Then you said that you thought I was wrong.  That is fine.  But I fail to understand how you're linking what I said to what your reasons why I am wrong:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
And it will only be right until straight white males get to march in &quot;Straight white male&quot; parades, or have Straight White Male TV or until straight white males arent called bigots for announcing that they are &quot;proud of their heritage.&quot;<br>
<br>
No that im a hater, Im all about equality. Im just not all about minorities asking for handouts. Affirmative Action is a double edged blade, my friend. Those who don't see that, are close minded.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No where in the quote (or in my post) did I say anything about how minorities should get special treatment.  I did not say anything about any group of people having parades or getting special handouts.  Nor did I say anything about Affirmative Action.  Since the quote is no way related to any of those things and since you didn't supply any other information to show that it was wrong, how can it be wrong?<br>
<br>
What really struck me as odd was<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
... Im all about equality.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It sounds like you're agreeing with the quote.<br>
<br>
I think you need to reread what I said and then what you said.  Then, maybe, you'll realize that your response was in error. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leilaya>Leilaya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/14/02 3:27:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> Anyone ever thought about the phrase 'Hate Crime'?<br>
<br>
Not only do I find it a stupid, stereotypical label, but I think it tends to lower the importance of crimes not stuck with this little title.<br>
<br>
If Trolo(a_white_guy_01) is rolling down 5th Ave. and sees Roggulbuk(a_white_guy_02), whom he hates with a fiery passion, and kills him... Well, that's a murder. Let's switch it up tho.. <br>
<br>
If Trolo is rolling down 5th, and sees AGayEQPlayer(whom he's never met in his life) and pops him for giving him an awkward eye at a red light.. Well, AGayEQPlayer's mom is going to make sure that the authorities know he was gay, and it'll be labeled a hatecrime. <br>
<br>
So, Trolo hates Roggulbuk and kills him.. Trolo doesn't like the way AGayEQPlayer looks at him, and kills him.. 2nd crime gets worse punishment...<br>
<br>
White guy kills black guy = Hatecrime<br>
Black guy kills white guy = crime<br>

<br>
Fitz,<br>
<br>
I know you didnt say minorities want special treatment. I said it. And my response wasnt in error, I can elaborate though.<br>
<br>
First, though, let me disclaim myself by saying that yes, I realzie to every group, there is an exception. So I will simply speak ABOUT what the media, and minority groups have made us aware of.<br>
<br>
You said that minorities only want equality, and I disagree. They dont want equality. They want handouts. Apparently, to people like GLAAD (the stupidest fucking group ever), Jesse Jackson, and NAACP, Free lunches = equality.<br>
<br>
My response about &quot;straight white males&quot; marching in parades and having their own TV show was basically a satirical jab at the fact that minorities are waving a banner in the face of America to express that they should have rights, while if you are straight, white, or male, and proud of it, you're apparently immediatly thrown into the same box as the KKK.<br>
<br>
I find that ridiculous. (even moreso considering the KKK have ditched their robes and replaced them with suits. They're non-violent, and preach purity, not genocide.)<br>
<br>
Sure, the KKK are still simply rednecks who are bent on keeping themselves alive and prosperous, which is, in its own, ridiculous. But how much different are GLAAD, and the NAACP, with the exception that the KKK isnt asking for handouts?<br>
<br>
It comes down to affirmative action. Minorities beleive that this disgusting little loophole will give them equality in America, and it doesn't. It potentially, and most likely yeilds unable people in the workplace, and higher qualified people unemployed, for starters. AA gives people reward where there is no merit, payment when there is none due.<br>
<br>
I will say AA does some good things. They do take legal action in situations where bigotry has interfered with employment and such, and that is where they should focus on. But sorry, I will not sit here and accept that minorities want &quot;real&quot; equality when they're getting the free lunch that I worked hard for.<br>
<br>
Ever watch Fox news? Some rep from the NAACP wants monetary reprecussion from the government for the slavery that took place 400 years ago. The guy was actually telling Bill O'Reily that HE, being white, owed HIM, being black (yet not a ex-slave), reprecussion, and that ALL white people owed the entire black race wages for the work ensued.<br>
<br>
Just a small example. Fucking ridiculous. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/kluzsig.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bogfatherbellybarsh>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1016<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/14/02 4:30:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=126>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/other_stfuget.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: tibert the fag</span><hr size=1> [quote]Homosexuals are an abomination before the Lord, says the Bible.

First of all - this opinion, in my opinion, is bloody disgusting.  However...<br>
<br>
[quote]Pour a gallon of cum in YOUR ass and see how far you advance the gene pool.

Or...for the ladies...eat some clit and watch your precious "evolution" take place.
[/quote]<br>
<br>
Then don't &quot;fucking flame&quot; us for not believing you.<br>
<br>
[quote]And before you pull "Love thy neighbor" on me I doubt it means Im supposed to go next door and poke Steve in the ass.
[/quote]<br>
That quote - in no way at all - reflects on being homosexual at all.  However, it means that you are meant to [b]love thy neighbour[/b], meaning RESPECT AND CARE FOR, just in case you can't see a word having two meanings.  <br>
<br>
You are directly and deliberately dissobeying the golden rule that - if you so ardently believe in the Bible - you should try and adhere to.  If you think that being Homosexual is wrong (and, I believe, there is a very vague mention of it, prove me wrong, by all means.  Bring me the actual quote.) then that is your perogative, but to deliberately hate and persecute people because they are homosexual is directly invalidating the golden rule, because you are not loving your neighbour as you would yourself.<br>
<br>
Think of it like this, to take it into a narrow-minded perspective.  You live in a town predominantly made up of people who are homosexual.  One day, you are viciously beaten because you are heterosexual.  Is this right for them to do this, because they have read it in a religious text (this is completely hypothetical), and believe that it is correct to do this because of their religion?<br>
<br>
Think carefully now. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mmmonkeybusiness.com/sigs/bogsig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bogfatherbellybarsh>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1017<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/14/02 4:31:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=127>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/other_stfuget.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: tibert the fag</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ARGHHHHHH</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

With the replies here.  Give me a break.<br>
<br>
You think he wants 'God-Loving' people like Trev (What a joke that sentence is - That post was about as far from the moral of the bible as one can get) spamming him all day long calling him an abomination.<br>

<br>
Two - I wasnt mis-interpreting the Bible, re-read my post.<br>
<br>
Three - If you know me in-game, and called me friend, then go ahead and send /tell.  My opinions dont change about people's sexual orientation, I was just putting down how I felt in relation to previous posts.  Posts about fuggin genetics and shit like that back on like page 4.  I just dont see it as getting the human race anywhere /shrug.  And no Im no junior Hitler.<br>
<br>
Four - I have yet to assault a single person for their race/sex/religion/sexual preference/marital stats/creed/etc.  Nor would I ever.  Live how you want to, and I'll live my way.  Just dont try and force me to accept it in a world thats become TOO accepting.<br>
<br>
Five - You wanna talk about discrimination and beating?  Try being a white boy from Detroit.  Thats all Im saying.<br>
<br>
Six - I expressed the views of MY religion.  If you dont like it, dont pay attention to it, it's that simple.  Never said I followed it 100% either.<br>

There, Im done, get your flame on and write down a buncha BS that wont matter tomorrow or in the next 20 minutes, just like this post. <p>Trevelain Dor'Seth<br>

And I don't post on chat boards to try and garner respect. I saw a chance to offer a different perspective on a topic of conversation and I took it. I'm certainly not here because I'm somehow looking for respect. Respect...on a flame board...riiiight. <br>
<br>
I think if you read back over many of the posts in this thread you'll begin to see why I choose not to post under my in-game persona - I play EQ to escape the problems I have in the real world. I'm not looking to drag any of them along with me. And its not just because I don't want the endless stupid /tells, its also because I don't want to be treated any differently in Norrath than I am now. The people I am friends with, group with and am guilded with know me as a certain persona and I'd like to keep it that way.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trevelaindorseth>Trevelain DorSeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/14/02 7:53:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=133>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: tibert the fag</span><hr size=1> Whoever you are, Anon, if you contact me in-game nothing will change between us as friends (if we know each other).

<br>
Heres the thing. You should stay silent about it. Not because it offends me, but because I don't care. If you're a friend in game, then great, I'll still tell you the same thing and still be a friend. All im saying is that I don't march around, and refer to my &quot;straightness&quot; as &quot;coming out&quot; because honestly, nobody cares. Im sorry if this offends you, but I dont see being gay as a feat or a phenominal accomplishment. At the same time, I dont see it as an offense to me.<br>
<br>
If you wanna be gay, be gay. But if you truly think about it, I don't think that telling the world that you fuck men is really ANY of the worlds business. If you should be offended at anything, it should be at the fact that your expected to wear homosexuality on your shoulder. (my own personal theories dictate that the media is responsible for that one. They just cant seem to just LET someone be gay.) <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/pictures/kluzsig.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calinthalus>Calinthalus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/14/02 9:38:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=135>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: tibert the fag</span><hr size=1> Well, someone asked so here it is:<br>
<br>
New International Version of the Holy Bible:<br>
I Corinthians 6:9,10<br>
&quot;Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.&quot;<br>
<br>
and for the purists out there, the same text in the King James Version:<br>
I Corinthians 6:9,10<br>
&quot;Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind; Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, use that as fuel if you wish, but if you are going to throw in the Bible at least take the time out to look it up.  That took me all of 5 minutes to find in my bible, and 3 of that was finding where the hell I left it.<br>
<br>
It is not your job as a christian to decide what anyone else should believe.  You are commissioned to be a &quot;witness&quot;.  Which in it's base terms means live your life as God has told you, and live as an example to others.<br>
<br>
Now the disclaimer, I am personally a Christian in my base beliefs, but my life is much more complicated than that.  If you want to get into it send me a tell sometime, I'll be happy to talk about it.  However, it is not my place to judge anyone elses actions.  What other people do is between them and God, no business of mine.  I have personally spent quite a bit of time as an drunkard, a fornicator, and in my past an adulterer.  That has no bearing on my life as it stands right this second.  If you want to take a stand against homosexuals that's your business, but saying you dont' want them near your kids is no different in God's eyes than having that teenage girl from down the street, who goes out on prom night with her boyfriend and blows him in the backseat, babysit for you.  You tell me what makes her better in Gods eyes  than a homosexual, or a mass murderer, or a pediphile.  There is no degree of sin in the Bible, a sin is a sin is a sin......and none of it is any of your fucking business if it isn't you doing it.<br>

As for everyone else, it is good to use religion to build up your morals when you have none.  Religion is like a parent telling a young child what is good and what is bad.  But you should try to support your morals without religion.  You need to grow up and develop morals for yourself.  It is one thing to follow blindly what someone said is good or bad, and it is another to understand why something is good or bad.<br>
<br>
If you understand the why, then you can explain your morals to everyone.  You aren't limited by the boundries of religion, parents, or whatever system you got your morals from. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 637<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/15/02 11:03:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=139>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: tibert the fag</span><hr size=1> I've been an abuser of myself since I was about 11 till I got married, I hope God dosen't stay too pissed about it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Using some jingoistic collection of ancient Judiac scrolls as a basis for a system of belief has always struck me as a bit silly, but whatever gets you through the day I guess.<br>
<br>
I too believe homosexuality to be an aberration of nature, it's an evolutionary dead end. <br>
<br>
Is it wrong in society?  Not in of itself, what 2 people do is their own business and dosen't really bother me that much. I think being overly sensitive and wearing a chip on your shoulder to be a bit silly however.<br>
<br>
Where it becomes my problem is when 2 gay people, men or women decide it's their right to circumvent evolution and adopt a child to raise in a gay household.  If you choose (or are chosen, whatever you believe) to live in a lifestyle that dosen't let you reproduce the species, you forfeit that ability no matter what. <br>
<br>
And since that lifestyle dosen't produce new taxpayers for the system, I don't see how it should be legally recognized for marriage and benefits either.<br>
<br>
Expecting the label of 'hater' and 'redneck' any moment, I hope i've gotten 'religious zealot' clearly out of the way in the first paragraph however. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59628">Jurrasic Epoch</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>
