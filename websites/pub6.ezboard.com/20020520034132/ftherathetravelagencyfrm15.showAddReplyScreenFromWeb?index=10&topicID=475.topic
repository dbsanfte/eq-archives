[Sat Mar 23 23:38:40 2002] Malidar tells you, 'we can talk about the situation, and what occured' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:39:24 2002] Malidar tells you, 'sound good?' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:40:02 2002] You told Malidar, 'not sure that talking will help the fact that i waisted 6 days camping a mob, vacation days, friends time and have nothing to show for it but i will read your post' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:40:15 2002] You told Malidar, 'who was the cleric that got the epic' <br>

[Sat Mar 23 23:41:20 2002] Malidar tells you, 'i assure you he was' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:41:40 2002] You told Malidar, 'before i read this is it your position that RF was not KSed?' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:43:06 2002] Malidar tells you, 'my position isnt determined fully yet - however, after almost losing a Rage myself, due to rules of camps - i am not sure it was ks. I do not feel that it is shei's fault however, because he wasnt on more then 5 mins before engagement' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:45:03 2002] You told Malidar, 'the logs do show allot, pretty clear it was a ks and no one from SoT would even respond to any /shout or /ooc regarding the camp, we did have enough to kill him with the help of NB, i just hope Wood realizes everytime he clicks his stick....' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:45:13 2002] You told Malidar, 'he obtained it in a very dishonorable way' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:46:11 2002] You told Malidar, 'and i dont see how having a RF taken from you can justify the same action' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:46:36 2002] Malidar tells you, 'it doesnt justify anything. But the rules to camping' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:46:44 2002] Malidar tells you, 'i dont like the situation man' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:47:12 2002] Malidar tells you, 'IMHO things like this - suck - and shouldnt be forced to be like this by verent making a rediculous bottle neck for us' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:48:18 2002] You told Malidar, 'that is just more justification for KSing, if i cannot get a job because the governement does nothing about making jobs, would that justify me to rob a bank to feed my family?' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:48:33 2002] Malidar tells you, 'my purpose to this /t is not to discuss the issue till you read my post. My reason for /t'ing is to try to make ends meet, and it will come with time' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:49:33 2002] Malidar tells you, 'to say it is a KS is debatable and is not the reason for my /t' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:49:45 2002] Malidar tells you, 'people will have a difference of opinion' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:50:02 2002] You told Malidar, 'not sure that will ever happen, many guilds do not plan to honor your guild in the future from the tells i have been getting, and to say it is or is not ksing is decided by the majority and that has been done' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:51:07 2002] You told Malidar, 'there is talk of SoT not being in rotations and such but i do not have anything to do with that, actions are judeged and people react accordingly, if nothing wrong was done then no one has anything to worry about' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:51:43 2002] Malidar tells you, 'by the rules of camping, i dont feel it was a KS, however - is debatable amongst the community, however i am writing to try to rectify the situation not stir a flameing kettle' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:51:51 2002] You told Malidar, 'and the more people try to justify it the more enflamed it makes everyone' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:52:11 2002] Malidar tells you, 'i am not justifying - i am rectifying' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:52:22 2002] You told Malidar, 'i understand that but this tell nor the post will change what has happend' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:53:05 2002] Malidar tells you, 'For the records, i am sorry you lost your camp. IF there is anything i can do - i will help you.' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:55:16 2002] Malidar tells you, 'also - if your /logging this, which im sure you are - make sure you note - I am against the fact it was a KS, however i want to rectify it knowing that you think we were wrong along with others.' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:55:57 2002] Malidar tells you, 'and to say we are gonna be held from rotations, i have no info on that or anything is the first that we have heard' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:56:06 2002] You told Malidar, 'it is logged and you have stated that many times so no need to make sure that is restated' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:56:23 2002] Malidar tells you, 'i just wanted it to be cleared for when you post it is all.' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:57:35 2002] Malidar tells you, 'all i wish is that you at some point will forgive for what was done, not now - but in the future, so the community will go on - im not into game politics' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:57:53 2002] Malidar tells you, 'but wish it could have went down different now' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:57:56 2002] Malidar tells you, 'hello' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:58:04 2002] Malidar tells you, 'oops' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:58:32 2002] Malidar tells you, 'what are you thinking man' <br>
[Sat Mar 23 23:59:34 2002] You told Malidar, 'i dont see this as game politics, this is something doen directly to me, i will not forgive for something such as this and like many many others have a no help policy with anyone wearing your tag....' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:00:02 2002] Malidar tells you, 'that is your option, and your views and cannot be changed' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:00:05 2002] You told Malidar, 'yours and others in SoT with there continured efforts to justify this shows the caliber of your guild' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:01:48 2002] Malidar tells you, 'again, i understand your upset - my only purpose was to try and settle a fire that obviously is too out of control. My point was not to discuss this now but to discuss it in the future after you read my post. Which all i did here was gener' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:01:53 2002] Malidar tells you, 'alize it greatly' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:01:59 2002] You told Malidar, 'the majority will decide and that they have, just read the posts and talk to guilds, actions do effect how people are treated' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:02:22 2002] You told Malidar, 'i will read it' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:02:25 2002] Malidar tells you, 'yep, im sure they will...' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:02:45 2002] Malidar tells you, 'this was not the intent of the day in SF... i guerentee you that' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:04:33 2002] You told Malidar, 'i will say that the reaction from your own guildmembers surprises me, some are pissed at me for all the posts against them, others are dissapointed with the actions, and some choose to justify it to make themselves feel better' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:04:58 2002] Malidar tells you, 'pissed at you?' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:05:02 2002] Malidar tells you, 'i dont understand that' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:06:02 2002] You told Malidar, 'Malidar is not online at this time.' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:06:05 2002] You told Malidar, '[queued], Daesun ( not sure on the spelling of his name) sent me a tell kinda accusing me of posting stuff but i have yet to post anything if i do at all, he wanted to talk to Bindor i guess but directed it at me as if i did something ' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:06:37 2002] Malidar tells you, 'odd' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:06:42 2002] Malidar tells you, 'oh well that isnt me' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:06:49 2002] Malidar tells you, 'what would you consider me' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:07:39 2002] You told Malidar, 'but the same tag, anyone with your tag reflects you just as anyone in CoN reflects upon me, if u dont believe that you should not have a tag' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:07:58 2002] Malidar tells you, 'i have pride in my tag, and will back it' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:08:22 2002] Malidar tells you, 'but i also feel there is individual actions in a GUILD' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:12:03 2002] Malidar tells you, 'so.. what shall i make of this conversation overall - what is your thoughts' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:12:55 2002] You told Malidar, 'it changes nothing that heppend' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:13:00 2002] You told Malidar, 'Malidar is not online at this time.' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:14:18 2002] Malidar tells you, 'no it doesnt that wasnt the point' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:15:14 2002] You told Malidar, 'the only point i see is to justify SoT actions, and the fact that u need to do that shows that what happend was not right, i really dont know what u want to hear from me' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:15:50 2002] Malidar tells you, 'i expected this kind of responce especially, seeing how i think we didnt KS' <br>
[Sun Mar 24 00:17:00 2002] Malidar tells you, 'my point again, is not to justify, cause i know your upsset' <br>

<br>
CoN engaged the mob to kite around but that person died(as i understand), Therefore the mob is open.  SoT was the next group to engage the mob, which gives them claim to the camp.  Camps mean nothing to VI, nor does the calendar, those policies are put in place by the players.  Disbanding SoT for this is very unlikely.<br>
<br>
Morally what they did is wrong, yes but they have continually apologized for their actions.  What woudl you like them to do?  Camp the mob for you?  it doesn't work like that.  Verant won't transfer the item simply because it was a legit kill for SoT, in the eyes of verant.<br>
<br>
On Zeb server, CiW formed up to kill one of the dragons for the sleepers key (Zlandicar i think it was, unsure though).  DH formed up right behind them while CiW was still buffing up, however CiW was first to the grounds.  DH did a quick buff and a GM told them it was ok for them to move in.  DH ran right over CiW and killed the dragon.  Lawfully correct, but morally incorrect.<br>
<br>
You can't expect everyone to be perfect, and you can't call SoT an evil guild for one instance, that's just plain juvenille and ignorant.  If this became a habit of them &quot;ksing&quot; mobs, then yes, it would be grounds to accuse them of being a bad guild.  However, this is their first instance in a long time.  its just silly that people are making this into a bigger issue than it really should be.  6 hours of your life are taken, great, take your hits and move on.  Your whining and complaining isn't going to get you anything.  SoT will still have a place on the calendar, they will still get ports, camps, spawns, whatever.  All you are doing is wasting time out of your life making continual posts regarding this.<br>
<br>
Yes i'm wasting my time writing this because i know half of you are going to flame me (this is a flame board, its expected) and its not going to change anything because you are all consumed by your own rage that you will hate on them as much as possible.  My advice is to just get a few friends and camp the mob again, take turns camping for like 3 hours at a time and just get the spawn again, as you're just wasting your time here <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upashun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pashun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/26/02 11:55:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=475.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: SoT KS</span><hr size=1> omfg...<br>

The uproar isn't over what Verant has in the ToS.  The uproar is over the fact that the rules of the community (much like the planar calendar) were broken, and that the little guy was walked on.<br>
<br>
No one is arguing who engaged first (though I bet it's alot muddier than your post reflects)... actually no one is arguing over the incident at all.  SoT has apologized, and state they are trying to make amends.  Good.  When the amends are made, then possibly people can start forgiving.. and at some point forget.<br>
<br>
But showing up and playing word games or letter of the law stuff is as worthless as me posting the reply that I have. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
SoT did wrong by the community, not Verant.  That's been agreed (even by SoT, with the apology). <br>
<br>
The one part you hit upon that isn't wordgames was that Vaylin will almost absolutely NOT transfer an epic or epic piece.<br>

Groont, the ragefire camp is 5-7 DAYS long, and Trompen was apparently there for more like 10 days. Maybe you have to be a cleric who's done the camp to realize just how draining, emotionally and physically, this camp can be. I wouldn't wish that camp on anyone.<br>

No words are going to bring Trompen's epic back.  We live in a violent world, violent deeds have made us who we are...<br>

For too long peace has reigned between the guilds, for too long we have used words that, however initially eloquent, generally dissolve into character assasination and personal attack...<br>

And as was pointed out, that is not possible, Vaylin will sit there laughing his ass off<br>
<br>
second, who said anything about a 6 hour camp?  I'm full aware of the camp's length, thats why i suggest get 8 friends who you trust, and take 3 hour shifts, so you still go to work, go out with your friends, whatever.  CoN is a good guild and most of them i know as trustworthy, so why can't trompen have a guildie set up another computer for 3 hours or however long the average play time is and camp the spawn.  This lets trompen have a life and go to work and stop wasting vacation hours.  This allows someone else to still play there character (or better yet use trompen to powerlevel in skyfire or whatever).  Trompen gets epic piece, and not much of that time used was his own.<br>
<br>
We sit here glowering over unrealistic solutions, which is a waste of time.  The real solution needs to come through instead of this wasteful whining and bickering.  Trompen is most likely, not going to get someone to camp the mob for him from SoT.  I don't think its worth their time, but that's just speculation, as only they can answer that.  The best thing he can do is take his hits and move on.  Life will only get harder for him if this bashing of SoT keeps going.  Pretty soon they get pissed and say fine, don't expect any help from us.  Then who do you call to CR you in fear?  BotS?  it makes you wonder if this is truly worth it.  If all this flaming of SoT is truly worth the possible outcomes.<br>
<br>
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.  Watch, when SoT finally says no to a CR assistance, you all gonna be right back here telling them how evil and stuck up they are.  I don't blame them if they say no.

Refer to Grul's post.  If you have never @#%$'ed someone over, then feel free to post, if you have, then stfu.  No one's perfect.<br>
<br>
Now you sit there and try and attack me.  Yet what have i done aside from trying to break up an appearant fight.   You're blinded by your own hatred, Graal.  You can't do anything to the people you're really angry at and you just take it out on other people.  I don't know all the details as to what went on, I just know that i see people acting like morons flaming a guild that helps them half the time over one instance.  Grow up is all I say.  and yes.. OJ was guity<br>

Defend your honor, regain the respect of your peers! Taste the blood of an adversary who will not see that your way is the one true path! <br>

MIGHT IS RIGHT IN THIS WORLD.  It always has been and always shall be.  The rule of law has always been bent to the will of those who have the power.<br>
<br>
Make alliances! Plan battles! Gather together and make those who defy you and sneer at your weakness feel the true wrath and scorn of LEGION!<br>
<br>
Agree upon appropriate restiution by the vanquished if that seems the only way to resolve the issue.  For example, SoT could agree to assist in camping the zone again so Trompen can get his epic if they get beaten down...<br>
<br>
Sure, even now, SoT could say, &quot;Hey, we're sorry, we're gonna help you camp your epic now, we see that we we're wrong&quot; etc... but overall they really don't see how they have done wrong...  <br>
<br>
This is a two way street and I can see truths to both sides of the disagreement.  Release that stress and kill one another people... don't give yourselves an ulcer over a (dare I say it?) silly game.<br>

<br>
I've seen people continually saying SoT made a mistake, that they should be forgiven (I'm not saying it's my place to forgive).  This wasn't a mistake - a mistake is where you go &quot;oops&quot;.  There was no oops here - it was premeditated.  The logs bear out that there was no remorse - they went in knowing the CoN guy was going to be screwed.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unicolaiironcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicolai IronCross</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knights of the Iron Cross</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/26/02 6:56:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=475.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: clarification</span><hr size=1> First, a reply to Grulnick:<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate to inform you of this, but trompen's loss was not that great, he can camp it again, he doesn't have to start all over.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow, Grulnick, I thought maybe you could see farther than yer own nose.  No, this wasn't a loss that compares to losing something valuable in RL. But, it was a HUGE loss of time.  You really have no concept of community or shared gameplay space.. do you?<br>
<br>
I can't even fathom how you can straight-faced type that, other than just to troll.<br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
And now, Groont:<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know all the details as to what went on, I just know that i see people acting like morons flaming a guild that helps them half the time over one instance.&quot;<br>
<br>
One instance can easily outweigh 100x itself in good deeds.  I trust Dwallyn's log post, and that is easily enough reason for this to be more of an outrage than you give it credit for.<br>
<br>
Second, the only moron I see is the one who doesn't take the time to learn the basic details presented here and then posts how we're baselessly flaming.. is you.<br>
<br>

<br>
This may come as a shock to some of you.. but mmrpg's aren't single-player games.  You're playing with a large amount of other live people.. any action you take has a consequence.  Simply explained.. this is called c-o-m-m-u-n-i-t-y.  Some communities evolve into no-holds-barred ffa fests, some evolve into communities that try to benefit more than one dominant group.... but they're all communities. No, you don't just get to pay yer $12/mo, and do whatever you feel like.  You can try.. but there are in-game consequences to your actions.. and these effect the people behind the screens emotionally and psychologically.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, but Nicolai, it's just a game!&quot;  Yeah.. whatever, this ain't monopoly, Jack.  It involves a large amount of real people (gasp! with real feelings!) who spend an enormous amount of time interacting with each other.  The emotional attachments to other people and the attachment to the time invested are only trivialized by dimwits that say &quot;It's only a game&quot;.  To those, I recommend going back to Diablo or Quake.. it better suites you, and the rest of us can actually take responsibility for our actions and realize there are consequences without you @#%$ it up for us.<br>
