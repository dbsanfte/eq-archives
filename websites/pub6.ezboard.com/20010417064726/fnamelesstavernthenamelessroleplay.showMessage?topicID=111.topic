Just to see if anyone notices.  This is done in installments as I get time btw.<br>
<br>
NEW:  Episode 4 has now been added.  Enjoy.<br>
<br>
Episode 1. &quot;The Quest&quot;<br>
<br>
Lord Qyzar surveyed the young Iksar standing before him carefully. While it was true that Sarkokrul had been successful on every previous quest that he had been given, this would be the most difficult yet, and he wondered if the Shadow Knight would be up to it. The young dark knight was different from the rest, he shunned using the traditional shadow knight khukri and instead wielded his preferred wurm slayer, a large and cumbersome weapon Qyzar thought, but used with precision and deftness by this Iksar. Reports back to the Lord of the Iksar Shadow Knights had told of Sarkokrul easily cleaving the heads of Sarnak knights from their bodies in single precision thrusts. Yes this young Iksar was different from the rest, and that was the reason he stood before the Dark Knight Lord.<br>
<br>
“I have dispatched crusaders Golin and Fodcod to retrieve an ancient ceremonial dagger from within the underground crypt of Dalnir”, Lord Qyzar stated. “They have been gone for more than 3 full moon cycles and have yet to return, I fear that they have fallen prey to the Kly that inhabit that vile place now.” <br>
<br>
Qyzar watched Sarkokrul intently, looking for signs of apprehension from the young Iksar, but if there were any signs of emotion they were hidden behind the stoic face presented. Qyzar continued, “If the crusaders have fallen to the Kly in that place then they are minions to the Kly now and are forever gone, and should you see them they should be released from their torment.”<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul knew what was being communicated. Should he encounter either of the two fallen crusaders in his mission he would dispatch them to Cazic Thule and thus end their pain of failing to complete their assigned task.<br>
<br>
Qyzar noticed a perceptible rise in the corners of the Iksar’s mouth, and realized that his command would be fulfilled if Sarkokrul came upon the two crusaders. He nodded ever so perceptively at the young knight to show his approval, and then continued his orders. “You will proceed to the home of the Kly and retrieve the ceremonial dagger from their lair.” Qyzar continued, “I give you but one moon cycle to complete this task, you may take with you who you wish, but be cautious that they are strong of mind for the Kly are treacherous and have means of controlling those who are not of strong will, thus using them against you.”<br>
<br>
“I understand Lord” Sarkokrul snapped to attention in answering.<br>
<br>
“Return the dagger to me here, and the khukri that was to be Golin’s will be yours.” Qyzar stated flatly. “Who will you recruit to assist you on this?” He asked.<br>
<br>
“I can think of only one who I would trust my life to,” Sarkokrul announced quietly. “My brood brother.”<br>
<br>
Qyzar held in check his impulse to smile at this irreverent Iksar. It was highly uncommon for members of one brood to be indoctrinated in the ways of more than one arcane art, the two brothers had taken different paths in life, yet were joined by family blood. Young Talokrul was proving to be a formidable and adept Shaman within the Iksar shaman guild from what Qyzar had been told, and the two brothers together were said to be a most lethal combination. Stories of their raids on the Sarnak were becoming lore in Cabilis, not only for their success, but for their ferocity as well. The stories were told of two Iksar raiders invading the land of the dark elf outpost and leaving no less than seventy-five headless Sarnak corpses in their wake. The viciousness of the raid is said to be of Talokrul’s doing. The shaman had been caught by a small band of Sarnak near the lake of I’ll Omen as an initiate, and had been tortured for nearly three days, before he had escaped their small encampment, but not until they had removed his tongue by burning it out with the end of a heated sword. Since his return, the young Iksar was voiceless, but utterly vicious in any encounters with Sarnak since. <br>
<br>
Lord Qyzar knew that the two together were more than formidable, they were ferocious and single minded. “Go then young Shadow Knight and return within the moon cycle.” Qyzar stood and returned Sarkokrul’s salute.<br>
<br>
“May the spirit of Cabilis and Cazic Thule be with us.” Sarkokrul whispered, and quickly turned and left. He would seek out his brother, and once again they would go forth and taste the blood of the Iksar enemy.<br>
<br>
Episode 2. “The Joining”<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul slowly made his way through the shaman guild house on his way to the lower levels. He had passed through the guild hall a number of times since his brother’s return from the Lake, and each time the looks of surprise and nervousness from the number of adepts in the hall amused the young Shadow Knight. As he made his way to the door leading to the stairway a voice from behind demanded his attention.<br>
<br>
“Shadow Knight. What business requires your presence in our hall?” The voice of Hierophant Dexl demanded.<br>
<br>
“I have come for Talokrul Drokraken Excellency.” Sarkokrul answered solemnly, slightly bowing his head to the great Shaman in a show of respect as he spoke.<br>
<br>
Dexl viewed the Shadow Knight in front of him warily. Sarkokrul Drokraken had visited his brood brother a number of times, each followed with the two leaving the confines of the Shaman hall and Cabilis and venturing into the dangerous lands near the dark elf outpost on the far side of Warslik Woods and beyond. And each time they returned, there would be rumors of some calamity that had befallen an enemy of Iksar, and each calamity was of more violent, and vicious nature than the previous.<br>
<br>
“I understand that you and your brother recently visited the lands surrounding the high elf compound in Firiona Vie.” Hierophant Dexl stated more than asked of the Iksar before him.<br>
<br>
“Yes Excellency.” Sarkokrul replied.<br>
<br>
Dexl knew that asking the purpose of the excursion would be futile. Neither of these two of the clan Drokraken spoke much unless directly asked. The young Talokrul had had his tongue taken by low life Sarnak, and his older brother Sarkokrul either in sympathy with his younger sibling, or in respect to his pain had taken to hardly speaking out loud as well.<br>
<br>
From what Dexl had heard from the few travelers that were allowed to enter Cabilis and from brief discussions with Lord Qyzar, he had pieced together a fairly complete story of the results of the last “Drokraken” raid as they were beginning to be called. The crusaders had learned of a traitor in their guild and had sent the young Sarkokrul to investigate and eliminate him if he could learn his identity. That was the last time that Sarkokrul had visited the shaman guild hall in search of his brother, and they had left immediately and returned within only a week. According to what Qyzar had said, the two had located the traitor, and after killing the drachnid spy whom he was dealing with the two had disposed of the traitor crusader, and then left an undeniable message to the drachnid and high elves of their recent presence. <br>
<br>
The two had severed the torso of the drachnid and placed the torso and lower body on spikes inside the area of the valley controlled by the spider people. The traitor who had been masquerading as one of the elf trackers of the outpost, they staked his headless body just outside the great bridge surrounded by seven or eight bodies of dead pilgrims who had the unfortunate luck to encounter the two as they prepared their message. Needless to say the spider rider and high elf compounds were thrown into panic at the impunity of an Iksar raid so deep into their lands, and at the viciousness of the resultant messages. Qyzar said that Sarkokrul had returned the stolen tomb to the Shadow Knight Lord and that the family of the traitorous crusader had been given a present of the severed head to ensure his shame was theirs as well.<br>
<br>
Dexl shook the images from his mind and returned his attention to Sarkokrul. “Your brother is in his room in meditation. Shall I send an adept to fetch him?”<br>
<br>
“No Excellency, I must speak to him alone.” Replied Sarkokrul as he bowed ever so slightly and quickly made his way through the door leading to the stairs.<br>
<br>
Hierophant Dexl thought to himself that he must watch the brothers closely, Talokrul was becoming an excellent shaman, and Sarkokrul was becoming a strong force in the Shadow Knight guild. While leaders of the two guilds maintained a mutual respect, they were always just under the surface at odds with each other. Should open guild war breakout, Dexl knew that only the brood blood ties of the Drokraken clan would direct the way of the two young Iksar. And the two were becoming a powerful force to be reckoned with in such a case. Hierophant Dexl thought to himself in retrospect. Should a war between shaman and shadow knight develop, it would be best for both sides if the two Drokraken were removed from any equation at the outset. <br>
<br>
Sarkokrul stood before the rough wood door deep below the shaman guild hall. A light tap of the sword hilt to the frame announced his presence to the room’s occupant. Footsteps on the other side approached the door, and slowly it opened to reveal his brother in full armor.<br>
<br>
“I see you expected me again brother.” Sarkokrul stated with a bit of surprise once again in his voice. How his brother knew of his visits before hand puzzled Sarkokrul. If there was one thing the Shadow Knight prided himself on was being unpredictable. Yet his brother always seemed to anticipate his arrivals and be waiting in full armor readiness.<br>
<br>
Talokrul nodded, and with a slight smirk crossing his face made a small number of hand gestures and then pointed back down the hall from which Sarkokrul had come.<br>
<br>
“We go to meet the Kly, and should be back within the next moon.” Sarkokrul quietly answered to his brothers sign language questions. Since the unfortunate encounter with the Sarnak by the Lake, the two brothers had developed a simple sign language between them to communicate. Though seldom was even that amount of communication necessary when on the hunt. The two had a natural sense bond between them, and they always anticipated each other precisely.<br>
<br>
The two Iksar quickly strode up the stairs and out of the guild hall, ignoring the inquisitive glances of the remaining Hierophants and Adepts scattered about in prayer or meditation. Sarkokrul however, noticed the cold and penetrating gaze of Hierophant Dexl as he strode out the gate. There was something about his gaze that troubled Sarkokrul. A small hand gesture from Talokrul confirmed that he had the same sense. Whatever troubled them about it would have to wait. They were a good three day trip from the Kly stronghold, and they would need to be careful of the Giant stronghold along the way.<br>
<br>
The two stopped just outside the gates of Cabilis to inspect their packs, and ensured that all the proper provisions were taken care of.<br>
<br>
“Shall we go then brother?” Sarkokrul whispered quietly into the night air.<br>
<br>
A perceived nod of his brother’s head told him they were ready for their journey. Sarkokrul stepped forward but felt the firm grasp of Talokrul’s hand on his arm. Turning to face his brother, Sarkokrul could read the face before him and knew the question being asked.<br>
<br>
“Yes brother, the family of Goxnok received our present.” Sarkokrul stated flatly, and stepped off along the trail leading to the west. <br>
<br>
A look of satisfaction crept across the young shaman’s face, and he quickly stepped off behind his brother. Once again they were together and on the hunt he thought to himself. The blood of the Kly would be new to them, but he was sure that they would see much of it. And quickly the two Iksar disappeared from view from the entrance to Cabilis.<br>

<br>
Sarkokrul and Talokrul stood quietly at the edge of the small waterfall.  From their vantage point they could see the small river flow south, under the small wooden bridge, and past the large fort with it’s massive wooden walls and large hovels within. Squatting down on his haunches, Sarkokrul put his nose to the air to sense his surroundings.  More than once had this simple precaution saved the Iksar from unexpected encounters in the past, and now he did it out of habit.  The trip from Cabilis had been uneventful so far, and Sarkokrul intended to keep it that way until they found the hidden entrance to the Kly crypt.<br>
<br>
A low guttural  hiss emanated from Talokrul resting on his haunches next to his Shadow Knight brother. “Yes brother.” Sarkokrul acknowledged.  “The air is full of their scent.”<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul glanced at his Shaman brother, and watched as Talokrul’s nostrils twitched at the vile attack on his sensitive nasal passages.  The stench from these large skinless beings saturated the air in all directions, they would not be able to pick up other scents until they were well past this outpost of the Greenwoods.<br>
<br>
There had once been a time when the two Iksar hunted the large skinless giants around the fort when they were traveling through Warslik Woods, but those days were long since past.  There was no longer sport in the kill.  Only if one of the dumb creatures were careless and attacked them would they end it’s miserable existence.<br>
<br>
A small hand gesture from his brother caught Sarkokrul’s attention, and he gazed up the winding path to their left in the direction Talokrul indicated.  At the same instant the sound of metal on metal reached his ears, the unmistakable sound of sword against sword began to grow louder as what ever fighting was ongoing made it’s way closer to the two Iksar.<br>
<br>
As they watched the trail where it crested the hill to the left, a glint of steel in the sunlight could be seen as a small group obviously in the heat of a battle formed a line abreast just this side of the small hill.  Sarkokrul watched intently as the pursuing foe crested the hill right behind the first group.  Three of the large greenwood giants lumbered up the hill and stopped as they reached the ridge and confronted the defensive stance of their prey.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul squinted into the setting sunlight to make out the scene developing before him.  One of the initial four stepped quickly behind the other three and began some sort of incantation.  Sarkokrul looked at the heavy armor on the small creature and realized it was a Dwarf.  As the Dwarf continued his incantation, a blue mystical shield enveloped the easily recognizable Elf.<br>
<br>
“Bah..  Dwarf Cleric and an Elf Tracker,” Sarkokrul hissed quietly.<br>
<br>
 Sarkokrul noticed the small number of hand gestures from his brother out of the corner of his eye.  “Aye brother.”  Stated the Shadow Knight flatly, acknowledging his brother’s identification of the other two members of the group as Dwarf Warriors.<br>
<br>
The two warriors stood their ground in front of the advancing Giants and wielded their blades in near unison as the first of the Greenwoods charged the small group’s position.  Quickly encircling the slow moving oaf the two warriors and tracker slashed at the giant’s legs cutting deep into the meat forcing it to fall to its knees thus bringing its more vital areas within reach of their well aimed thrusts.  A final dual thrust from both behind and in front by the two warriors ended the foolish giant’s life and it fell forward to the ground with a loud and mournful groan.<br>
<br>
The two remaining giants, stopped their advance, taking stock of their comrades demise for a moment.  Sarkokrul thought they might give up the attack at this point, but knew better.  While these were extremely large and dangerous, they were not the most intelligent of creatures.  They would press the attack, if only to be slain in the same fashion as their friend.<br>
<br>
As Sarkokrul watched the inevitable demise of the remaining giants, a new scent in the air made his muscles tense, and his eyes quickly scanned the low brush just behind the small band caught up in their current fight.<br>
<br>
“Goblins brother.”  Sarkokrul whispered, and could sense that Talokrul had picked up their scent as well.  Quickly moving from their perch over looking the waterfall the Shadow Knight and Shaman made their way below the small bridge and up the bank to a small rise to the south of the continuing giant battle.<br>
<br>
As the two Iksar breached the ridge they spotted the group of five goblins huddled in the undergrowth intently watching the battle taking place in front of them.  Sarkokrul slowly crept forward towards the unsuspecting ambush careful to remain down wind from the filthy creatures. <br>
<br>
Another of the giants had fallen to the swords of the warrior dwarves and the last of the large dumb creatures was easily surrounded and thus his fate sealed.  Sarkokrul could see the goblins beginning to prepare for their attack on the unsuspecting and tired troupe, and moved slowly closer, now within striking distance of the witch doctor obviously leading the raiding band.<br>
<br>
With a loud groan, the final giant gasp his final breath and fell forward to the ground expiring as he fell.  The elf and dwarves slumped to the ground obviously exhausted from their battle.  They would be easy kills for the goblins.<br>
<br>
The four goblin battle masters quickly came to their feet, intent on the scene to their front.  But as they started to step forward to attack the unsuspecting group on the trail, one by one the ground around them became alive with motion and they found themselves entangled in various vines and roots springing as if by magic from the very earth.  Sarkokrul stepped forward swinging the large wurmslayer blade in a large arc centered on the unfettered witch doctor.  The blade struck home slicing deeply into the side and back of the unsuspecting goblin.  The force of the swing balanced with the weight of the large weapon nearly cleaving the goblin in half.  As the goblin leader expired, his shriek of surprise and pain filled the air.<br>
<br>
As Sarkokrul moved past the now dead leader he took aim at the larger of the remaining goblins intent on eliminating the threat from most dangerous to weakest in short order.  The goblin raised his sword in defense, but could not pull himself free of the entanglements at his feet to escape the oncoming Iksar.  Sarkokrul once again moved quickly and started the large blade in a arc with the larger goblin as its intended target.<br>
<br>
As the blade sliced through the defenseless goblin in front of him, Sarkokrul saw the next goblin in size to his left shudder as he was struck with a cold blue wind that tore at his skin, nearly killing him instantly.  As Sarkokrul wheeled to his right, he brought the large blade streaking to its mark on the second goblin,  the blade sliced deeply into the chest of the creature smashing ribs and severing lungs and heart as it made its way home. The shriek of pain escaped the goblin and  Sarkokrul knew it was a killing blow.<br>
<br>
Just to his left Talokrul had stepped forward and thrust the large spear like Chokidai Prod deep into the goblin half dead from the force of the frost wind that had struck him.  The third goblin expired as the Chokidai point completed its passage through its shuddering body and exited through the goblin’s back, another more muffled shriek announced the goblins demise to the rest.<br>
<br>
The elf and three dwarfs were now on their feet and preparing themselves for an attack that they could not quite locate.  The shrieks of death emanating from the goblins steeling them into a defensive half circle on the trail.<br>
<br>
The two Iksar stepped back from their kills and turned their attention to the two remaining goblins struggling to free themselves from the entrapments at their feet.  The wide eyes locked on the two Iksar in fear.  Sarkokrul muttered a quick chant as he stepped forward to one of the remaining creatures, his hands beginning to glow in a sickly yellow hue.  The thrust of the blade entered the goblins side, but did not break through the rib cage protecting the vital organs beneath.  The goblin shuddered, and as Sarkokrul smiled quietly at the defenseless goblin, he could feel the life force flow from his enemy and fill him inside with strength and vitality.  As the two stood facing each other the goblin slumped to his knees with an audible whimper.  The movement dislodged the blade, breaking the life draining spell that the Shadow Knight had invoked.  But a quick wheel and the large blade sliced quietly through the neck of the goblin, releasing its head from its body which shook violently and collapsed forward.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul noticed the blue force wind strike the final goblin directly from the front, and it too collapsed whimpering at the feet of Talokrul.  It however was not yet dead, and lay on its back gasping for air as the Iksar Shaman stepped forward standing over its expiring body.<br>
<br>
The eyes of the goblin locked on the eyes of Talokrul.  The panting of the goblins gasps for air were audible now that the carnage was nearly over.  Talokrul stood quietly over the defeated and helpless goblin staring into the eyes of his prey.  A small crease of a smile formed on the Shaman’s face, and the goblin relaxed noticeably on the ground in front of him.  The Chokidai was a long and heavy weapon, but wielded nimbly by Talokrul.  With the goblin focused on the face the Iksar standing over him, the movement and thrust of the large piercing point was never seen.  Suddenly, the brain of the goblin understood, and the eyes grew wide with shock, as the Chokidai pierced its chest and impaled it to the ground underneath.  Talokrul pulled the weapon from its victim and stood facing his brother, the crease of a smile still formed on his face.<br>
<br>
The two Iksar stepped through the bush and onto the trail facing the now prepared elf and dwarves.  Under normal circumstances Sarkokrul would have struck the tired and weary group in front of him.  But these were obviously young creatures and would not be of any sport.<br>
<br>
“You are on Iksar land.”  Sarkokrul stated quietly.  His gaze focusing on the tracker.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul noticed the dwarves relax ever so perceptively, calculating correctly that if the Iksar were to attack they would not be ones to give preliminary warning.<br>
<br>
The cleric dwarf stepped forward cautiously and addressed the two Iksar before him.  “My apologies for this intrusion.” He started. “But we were passing through the woods in pursuit of a band of Kly who attacked our camp and were beset upon by these giants as we followed the trail to the south.”<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul kept his stare focused on the elf as he asked the next question.  “You know of  their Crypt lair then?”<br>
<br>
“Aye we do, and have no need to linger on your lands.”  The cleric answered.  “My name is Stubble Frey and we have no quarrels with your kind that I know of.”<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul continued to focus on the tracker who maintained his defensive stance.  “True we have no quarrel with your kind, but you bring this one with you.”  Sarkokrul said tipping the point of the large sword in the direction of the elf, hissing perceptively as he spoke.  <br>
<br>
“My name is Galien.” Spoke the elf as he came forward to stand next to the cleric. “I am from the land of Antonica, and take no side in your blood feud with the High bloods.”<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul pondered this elf as he came closer.  He had heard stories of elves other than the High and Dark elves that populated the enclaves of the Fironia Vie and the Overthere but he had never actually seen one before.  The scent was markedly different from his blood enemies that was true, but high elf or not, Sarkokrul continued to be cautious.<br>
<br>
“You say you are tracking a band of Kly that attacked you then?”  Sarkokrul asked, for the first time turning his gaze from the elf and facing the cleric Stubble Fey.<br>
<br>
“We were camped in a valley near the lake to the north, when we were attacked by one of their raiding parties.”  Responded the cleric matter of factly.   “They killed our out guards and stole off with two children of our clan.”<br>
<br>
Stubble Fey continued, “My brothers and I along with Galien hoped to catch them before they can make the safety of their lair.  But I’m afraid that these giants have delayed us too long and they may have made good their escape.”<br>
<br>
Talokrul made a few quick gestures with his hands, obviously confusing to the dwarf.  “My brother reminds me that night is approaching and that the goblins from the encampment will start patrolling the trails to the south from here.” Sarkokrul easily interpreted.<br>
<br>
“Then perhaps we should camp for the night and be fresh to start out in the morning.” Stubble Fey said.  “Perhaps you would join us in our camp, I am sure that the six of us would make for a secure and quiet evening of rest and story.”<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul glanced at Talokrul to sense his inclination to this unusual offer.  Seldom did the Iksar share encampments with outsiders, but these had knowledge of the Kly, and they would need to know all they could before they encountered them.  Sarkokrul turned to the cleric, “Your offer is indeed generous, and perhaps you would tell us of your encounters with these demons.”<br>
<br>
Soon a small fire burned at the side of the trail as the cloak of night fell over the sky.  The voices of the group were low as to not be heard more than a few paces away from the camp.  The two Iksar listened intently as the cleric Stubble Fey told stories of the Kly and their evil ways.  In the morning they would head south along the mountain foothills until they reached the ocean, where the cave entrance to the crypt would be found.  But until then there was information to be gotten, and Sarkokrul listened quietly to the Dwarf,  occasionally lifting his nose to the air.  <br>
<br>
Precautions were never wasted Sarkokrul thought to himself.  <br>

<br>
A warm breeze coming off of the hills and out to sea covered the two Iksar as they knelt hidden in the bushy growth off to the side of the masked cave entrance.  Sarkokrul and Talokrul had been watching the entrance to the cave now for a couple of days, noting the comings and goings of the Kly inhabitants, evaluating relative risks and their soon to be opponents.  While there was only an occasional excursion of the Kly from their haven, there had been a large party of Kly returning to the den the day before, with obvious prisoners or slaves.  They had quickly herded them into the entrance without either Iksar obtaining a good view for any type of recognition.  The wind had been blowing across their position from the west so that even a sniff of the breeze could not provide a clue as to the poor unfortunates being led presumably to their demise.<br>
<br>
“It will be daylight soon brother, we should start.” Whispered the Shadow Knight to his brother Shaman.  “They seem to be most active during the night so we should have some advantage in our first encounters.”<br>
<br>
Talokrul nodded his head in agreement, while continuing his observations of the cave entrance.<br>
<br>
Slowly, without a sound to be heard the two began gathering their provisions and stilling themselves for the upcoming raid.  Once packed and prepared, each of them started a quick flurry of hand gestures.<br>
<br>
Wisps of air encircled the two, and slowly their body’s began to shimmer and then fade into the background of the surrounding fauna.  Within a few seconds, all that could be seen where they were standing was the telltale signs of bent grass, lightly marking their presence. <br>
<br>
Quickly making their way into the cave, they followed the carved tunnel for a few minutes until it diverged into two opposite intersecting paths.  Talokrul sniffed the air about him and gave a small hiss as he started down the path leading directly to the right.  Sarkokrul followed his brother’s lead and took a quick sniff of the air as he moved to follow his brother, and could discern the scents of the Kly and slaves who had passed through the cave in the intervening days.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul, following closely behind his brother, tried to recognize the various scents wafting in the air around him.  The Kly scents were easy, for they had the peculiar odor of Sarnak about them.  Sarkokrul figured the Kly were a relative race to the Sarnak, and decided that they would be easily tracked once they entered the crypt proper.  The other scents combined into a mishmash of odors from nearly every race he had encountered in his journeys.  Dwarf, Iksar, Elf, Gnome, Erudite, and even a scent of Dark Elf could be determined.    These he figured were the slave population used by the Kly.  Unlike the Sarnak, the Kly appeared to be significantly more intelligent, which made them significantly more dangerous.<br>
<br>
Slowly, the walls of the rough tunnel began to show signs of more careful excavation.  As the two continued down the tunnel, the walls began to be more smoothed and worked, eventually opening out into a well formed hallway wide enough for the two iksar to walk abreast as they continued.<br>
<br>
As the two Iksar rounded a small bend in the hallway, the tunnel split into two separate paths.  Carefully examining the floor of the hallway, Sarkokrul noticed that the floor of the two paths appeared equally worn as opposed to the tunnel they had just been in.  Sarkokrul took a quick sniff of the air, the scent of Kly was weak, and only the scents of the slave races could be strongly noticed.   <br>
<br>
Following the contours of the winding hallway Sarkokrul began to hear the sound of movement farther down the passageway.  Moving silently along the wall, he came to an abrupt end to the hall.  Peering cautiously around the corner, he noticed that the hallway quickly expanded into a large cavern, with oil lamps lining the walls at various intervals.  At the far end of the cavern, a large massive structure stood lighted against the surrounding darkness.  The large columns easily fifty to 60 feet high, supported a massive and highly decorated roof structure, giving the building the appearance of a temple.  The steps leading up and through the large columns ended at a large ornate entrance with a much more intense light emanating from within.<br>
<br>
As Sarkokrul stood quietly surveying the massive temple, he noticed a number of small creatures hovering in and around the columns.  From the distance they seemed to behave like fish swimming in a lake, but Sarkokrul knew that these creatures were floating in the air as if by some magical power.  Taking note of the positions of the creatures and following their ebbs and flows around the entrance to the temple complex, Sarkokrul counted at least three of the creatures.<br>
<br>
Moving his focus back into the large cavern a number of creatures could be seen simply standing in various reposes throughout the large expanse of the cave.  Another four creatures occupied the cavern in addition to the floating things near the temple.  A Tier’dal stood quietly in the far corner of the cave nearest the steps, a skeleton at it’s side.  On the far right, a single Dwarf stood motionless.  Closer to the Iksar, two Goblins faced each other in a trance like state, neither moving or speaking.<br>
<br>
“Prepare yourself brother.”  Stated Sarkokrul flatly, holding up two fingers and gesturing to the area occupied by the two Goblins.<br>
<br>
Talokrul nodded his understanding, and prepared for the attack.<br>
<br>
Quickly moving to their right and along the wall of the cave, the two Iksar closed on the unwary Goblins.  Sarkokrul reached his target first.  Grasping the face of the Goblin from behind, he quickly brought the end of the large blade around in front of the unsuspecting beast and brought the blade effortlessly across the defenseless creatures neck, severing arteries, muscle, and wind pipe in a single effortless stroke.  A small gurgle of a sound could be heard, but not loud enough to be heard more than a couple feet away.  The first of the two Goblins slumped to the floor of the cave, drowning in it’s own blood.<br>
<br>
Talokrul timed his thrust of the Chokidai with the rapid movements of his Shadow Knight brother.  The long slender point of the weapon easily entered the Goblin, sliding through the spaces between ribs as they joined the backbone near the spine of the creature.  An instant later, with an additional thrust of the weapon, it continued its course through the chest cavity of the creature, puncturing the lungs, effectively silencing any possible sounds the beast may have attempted to utter.  Pushing farther the Chokidai found the heart and burst it within the body of the creature.  The body of the Goblin shuddered as the point exited the heart and struck the backside of the creatures breastbone, and it slowly fell to it’s knees and expired.<br>
Talokrul extracted the weapon and heard the sound of air rushing into the vacated wound.<br>
<br>
The two iksar now visible to all who could see in the dim lights turned and faced the remaining Tier’dal and Dwarf.  Prepared for an immediate attack by the two creatures, Sarkokrul was surprised to see that they had not moved even slightly.  The Tier’dal stood exactly where she had been, and the same was true of the Dwarf farther along the wall to the right.  The only movement from any of the remaining creatures in the cave that Sarkokrul could determine was the continual swimming of the beasts near the columns.<br>
<br>
“Either they will not move against us, or they can not move against us.”  Whispered Sarkokrul to his brother.<br>
<br>
Talokrul gestured quickly with his hands explaining what he planned to do.  Sarkokrul nodded his agreement, and pulled his bow from the quiver and notched an arrow.  <br>
<br>
Talokrul stood and walked directly to a point halfway between the two living statues, prepared to move in either direction should movement be forthcoming.  As he reached the center point of this first move, neither of the creatures moved, nor even gave notice of his presence.  Cautiously moving sideways, Talokrul neared the Tier’dal until he was but a few feet away and standing directly in front of it.  Still there was no movement in defense or attack from the creature.<br>
<br>
Talokrul gestured quickly and a purple haze enveloped the skeleton standing next to the Dark Elf, the ground seeming to come to life and engulf the feet and legs forming a hard grasp of the creature ensuring it’s inability to move farther.  Sarkokrul let loose the notched arrow at the Tier’dal, the bladed point entered the Dark Elf just below the center of the creature’s right eye and exploded the skull as it exited the back side.  A shower of bone and blood splattering against the cave wall behind it.  The force of the impact threw the creature backwards against the wall, a dull thud reverberating through the large cave.<br>
<br>
The skeleton seemed at that instant to come to life and struggle against the grasp of the ground surrounding it’s feet and legs, lunging in a vain attempt to reach the Iksar Shaman standing only a few feet away.  Talokrul stepped back and then forward bringing the Chokidai around in a large swinging arc impacting on the dead creature’s skull.  The brittle bone shattered at the impact, and the remaining skeletal form crumpled to the ground in a pile of dust.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul glanced at the remaining Dwarf.  It still had not moved during the second attack.  The lack of action puzzled the Shadow Knight.  “What is the purpose of having these evidently soulless creatures as guards, when they stand in silence without defending themselves.”  Sarkokrul thought to himself.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul moved his focus to the air swimming creatures near the steps, relegating the stoic Dwarf to the category of “non threat”.  Cautiously Sarkokrul and Talokrul approached the bottom of the giant steps watching the apparently aimless swimming of the three rather benign looking beasts.  Sarkokrul had never seen creatures such as these in his travels before, and cautiously watched them swim in the air around the columns at the top of the steps.  The creatures had dull gray and tan bodies, about the size of an Iksar torso, with long whip like tails streaming behind them.  No facial features could be discerned, nor limbs of any kind.  A small crease ran from one side of the front around to the other side, but Sarkokrul could not determine if this was an indication of a mouth as such or just an marking along the sides of the creature.   <br>
<br>
Sarkokrul cautiously placed his foot on the first step.  Quickly he noticed a change in the nearest floating creature.  It had turned sharply and stopped, the front of the creature facing directly at the intruding Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
The long crease around the edge of the creature began to open revealing several rows of large dagger sharp teeth.  As far as Sarkokrul could tell, the entire creature with the exception of the whip tail was nothing more than a ravenous mouth designed to rip it’s prey into small pieces of easily digestible pieces.  <br>
<br>
The nearest creature moved through the air quickly towards Sarkokrul, mouth gapping showing the many rows of sharp teeth each nearly the width of his hand long.  Sarkokrul thrust the wurmslayer forward intending to impale the creature on its two pronged point.  But the creature moved with exceptional quickness and agility and circled the reaching point of the weapon, closed with the Shadow Knight and bit savagely down on Sarkokrul’s left arm just below the shoulder.  The chain armor kept the teeth from penetrating the Iksar’s arm, but the strength of the jaws of the creature caused a sharp pain to rocket to Sarkokrul’s brain.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul released his grasp of his blade with his left hand and brought the weapon around and under the creature with his right, slicing the underbelly of the creature, releasing the beasts internal organs from their floating encasement.  At the same time a blue hue enveloped the creature, causing an involuntary shudder at the force of the cold blast unleashed by Talokrul.  The jaws of the creature became slack, releasing Sarkokrul’s arm from it’s grasp and sunk slowly to the ground, quivering in it’s own internal organs as it died.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul noticed another of the creatures beginning its attack, and the third moving to the left in an attempt to gain access to their flank.  Remembering the agility of the first creature, Sarkokrul waited until the second beast was nearly upon him before sidestepping to his right bringing his blade down across the back of the creature, opening a large gaping wound.  As the blade struck flesh, the ravenous looking beast turned sharply, attacking the Shadow Knight under the damaged left arm.   However, the creature was unable to acquire flesh, but the force of the impact knocked Sarkokrul to one knee, forcing the air from his lungs in a loud hiss.<br>
<br>
Talokrul saw his brother slump to one knee at the force of the second creature’s attack, but stayed concentrated on the third creature rapidly approaching from the left.  Talokrul gestured quickly, the blue hue of the cold force striking the creature head on stopping it’s advance.  Moving quickly while the creature sat stunned, Talokrul bashed the mouth of the creature with his shield forcing the front up and away from him, exposing the soft underbelly of the creature to his weapon.  Which penetrated easily from beneath, and exiting the top of the creature acting as a skewer, locking the large mouth shut.  The creature flailed against the air around it, trying to free itself from the impalement, but to no avail.  Slowly, Talokrul could feel the life of the creature ebb away as it slowly settled on the ground on it’s back, the handle of the Chokidai pointing toward the ceiling of the cavern.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul gasp for air, regained his feet, and faced the attacking creature preparing for the next lung.  The creature was moving slower now due to it’s wound, but was still intent on it’s prey.  The beast came directly at Sarkokrul at eye level, allowing Sarkokrul to see deep within the large dark mouth of the beast.  Side stepping to the right to protect his now broken left arm, the Shadow Knight thrust the blade tip inside the creatures mouth penetrating the roof and exiting through the previous wound.  The beast thrashed violently on the end of the large blade, like a fish on the end of a fishing pole, the tail and body convulsing in opposite directions.  Sarkokrul spoke a quick chant, his hands glowing in a yellow hue as he spoke.  A crease of a smile crossed the Shadow Knight’s face as the remaining life force of the creature passed through the blade and into the Iksar.  The life drained out of the creature, it slowly sunk to the ground.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul started to remove the arm protector over his broken left arm when a movement out of the corner of his eye alerted him to the presence of the oncoming Dwarf.  Turning to face the attack, Sarkokrul noticed the fury in the eyes of the approaching Dwarf, filling his expression with the rage of the tormented.  The eyes were wide, the mouth snarled, as if filled with true blood hate.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul stood his ground, awaiting the force of the attack he knew to be coming.  The Dwarf let out a scream of rage and anger, that filled the cavern, and leapt upon the Shadow Knight.  As the Dwarf leapt, Sarkokrul closed his eyes and struck the oncoming creature with the palm of his hand, fingers spread, making contact directly over the attacking Dwarf’s heart.  The room exploded in a crackling sound of thunder and the Dwarf fell writhing in pain on the ground at Sarkokrul’s feet.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul stepped forward raising the sword to strike the killing blow.  As he focused on the face of the Dwarf, Sarkokrul recognized the Dwarf as cleric Stubble Fey, whom he and his brother had shared camp with only a few nights before.  The shock of recognition, caused the Shadow Knight to slowly lower his weapon.<br>
<br>
“Please. Kill me friend.  Please.” Begged Stubble Fey as he lay on the floor before the two Iksar.   His face alternating between rage and pain.  “Please.” He sobbed.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul raised his weapon again and brought it down against the neck of his recent acquaintance, easily cleaving the head from the body.<br>
<br>
The two Iksar turned and faced each other.  Neither needing to speak or attempt to speak of what had just taken place.  The Kly had captured the cleric and possibly the rest of the small group, and had been the slaves taken into the cave the night before.  The rage on the face of the Dwarf spoke of his torment and requested relief from it’s bond.  <br>
<br>
Sarkokrul thought to himself, “What manner of creatures are these Kly, that they can take the mind of others and move them to their own purpose?”<br>
<br>
The two iksar moved around the side of the temple, out of sight of the entrance, where Talokrul began to tend to the broken arm of his brother.  The small alcove was obviously unused from the thick layer of dust on the floor.<br>
<br>
“ We must be more vigilant brother.”  Said Sarkokrul, “The treachery we face appears to be great indeed.”<br>
<br>
Talokrul nodded in quiet agreement.<br>
<br>
Sarkokrul looked at his arm carefully.  The regeneration would take some time.  They would rest in the alcove and continue once it had healed completely.   Sarkokrul closed his eyes and saw the anguished face of Stubble Fey in his mind’s eye, and slowly slipped off to sleep.<br>
