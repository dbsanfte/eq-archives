<br>
I do agree however, who ever was the leader of the group should have had the balls to tell you that they replaced you. Depending on how much time was between each LD would determine when i would have kicked your ass out of the group. 3 times in an hour = you are out plain and simple, dont care if you are my best friend or som dumb fuck i dont know.<br>
<br>
As for it being done with a named up /shrug who knows will let others take this challenge.<br>
<br>
But i have grouped with mud before, and i agree with Rug he is a dam good cleric, no question asked. He is one of the few clerics i dont have to worry about if he is watching the game of tv when my health is low.<br>
<br>
But lets all face it, if this had happen with no named up it wouldnt have come to the RTA, all this is, is a lootwhore cat fight.<br>

<br>
  The point here is courtesy between guilds.  Yes I am Muddlerezzer's RL brother, I do live in the sam house with him and was able to see his computer the whole time.  In the 4-5 hours he was in the group he had a total of 3 &quot;LD&quot; if you count his /q attempt to avoid getting killed when group was wiping.  <br>
<br>
  I was also told I would be contacted by the guild leader, and was not contacted, Even though I was on for the rest of that day and late into the night.  Orrocuar sat in a group with me to talk to me about it after I had spoken to the officer, and claimed Muddle went LD repeatedly... I know this is not true because, as I said, I can see Muddle's computer and we share the same router.  <br>
<br>
  And to those of you who agree that kicking a group member out of the group to replace them with a friend or guildie is ok, maybe you should learn something called common courtesy.  This is a game, we are all here to enjoy ourselves and have fun, but there are people behind each and every one of the characters.  You should treat people the way you would like to be treated. <br>
<br>
  I have been playing this game since before Kunark, and as an enchanter I have met every type of person, from the overgenerous nice guy to the complete Ass.  I still do my best to treat each person as that .. A PERSON.   All actions have repercussions in life.   <br>
<br>
   If this was the first and only time this type of incident had happened I would not have cared, but this is not.  It seems taht it is standard KoO policy to boot non-guildies from groups to replace them with guildies.  You say you have aresponsability to the members of your guild, and I agree with this. That responsability also includes giving your guild a good reputation with other people on the server.  Actions of this nature will not do that. <br>

Which has nothing at all to do with being thrown out of a group.  Which is the point of this thread.<br>

If you invite someone to a group cause you 'need' them, because no one of that class is on from your guild, don't throw them out when someone from your guild does log on.

Muddle was kicked out because he kept going LD.  The keepers didnt tell him they were kicking him as well as they could.  Fault can be layed on both side.  And crist almighty, how many times a day does a ld'er kicked out of a group?  we'd have to start a whole new board just to keep up with them.  i notice his logs dont make any mention of the number of lds. the group does need to be a damn bit more diplomatic about kicking people out though.  they were within their rights to remove him from the group, no need to them pussyfoot around it.<br>
<br>
Loot my ass.  Re-read the thread, named mobs werent mentioned untill muddle started taking a beating for a stupid thread.  If it was such a goddamned issue he would have mentioned it off the bat.  how long was the damn named up anyhows?  woulda been one helluva coincidence for mud to relog at the exact same moment a named pop.  the group offered to go to /raid so that he could participate in the named takedown.  <br>

<br>
So, if what you say is true, and this event occurred the same day you posted, I want to congratulate you on how you chose to handle this, Flyer.<br>
<br>
I'm not difficult to find.  Your brother found our message board.  My E-mail and Personal Message box are available 24 / 7.  But instead of trying to handle this like a man, Guild Leader to Guild Leader, in a choice example of diplomacy you chose to take this to Flame Friggin' Central within hours of it happening.  Smooth move.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;The point here is courtesy between guilds.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Considering the above, I'm having a hard time keeping a straight face when I read that remark.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I was also told I would be contacted by the guild leader, and was not contacted, Even though I was on for the rest of that day and late into the night.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And now, without even attempting to contact me to present your issue, and having instead decided to publicly disrespect my guild on the RTA boards, you expect ME to contact YOU?  Dream on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;You should treat people the way you would like to be treated.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You reap what you sow.  You want this forum?  You got it.  There's a right way and a wrong way to handle issues such as this between guilds, and in my opinion you chose the wrong way.  Reading the way this thread is going, it's not exactly enhancing your chances of being appointed Ambassador to Finland, if you get my drift.  Probably for the best.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;It seems taht it is standard KoO policy to boot non-guildies from groups to replace them with guildies.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I'm not even going to discuss with you the right or wrong of this issue in light of ridiculous and irresponsible comments like the one above.  You have no idea what our policies are because you chose not to engage me in conversation.<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say that in a game with thousands of unique individuals participating, I'm surprised that it functions as well as it does with all the personalities involved.  We are not employed in Everquest (well, maybe Cheeztwo *shrugs*.)  No one has an employment contract that stipulates they have a &quot;right&quot; to participate in *any* grouping of individuals in this game.  If it's working, it happens.  If it isn't, it doesn't.  Plain and simple.  There are no *rights* being trampled here.<br>
<br>
Could it have been handled differently and smoother?  Without a doubt.<br>
<br>
Is it worth flaming an entire guild?<br>
<br>
Apparently, in your eyes.<br>
<br>
A wise man once gave me a very valuable piece of advice:<br>

<br>
As for me, I was on one night, which is unusual these days, but I noticed my connection seemed sluggish and as we began to take out whatever we were raiding (royals I think, may have been vindi), I went LD several times. When I realized I was going to be a hinderance to everyone, I did the right thing and excused myself and logged.<br>
<br>
I would have booted you with a lot less tact than the current leadership of KoO and as far as putting the guild on your &quot;do not buff list,&quot; that would be foolish considering KoO have more to offer you as allies than as enemies. But by all means, put me on your &quot;do-not-help-list.&quot; It will save us both stress. I won't feel guilty for leaving you out of loot when you are offline *boggles* and you will have the vindication of not helping someone who thinks you are a pathetic whiner who can't maintain a good connection.<br>

<br>
Muddle's a decent guy, he can play a cleric well, he doesn't fuck people about, and I've known him for a long time - ever since my Opalline Eternity days, remember Muddlefoot, Drache? That's him.  <br>
<br>
He wasn't owned.  Ageist insults are as poor and backhanded as &quot;your mum&quot; jabs.  <br>
<br>
While I don't advocate him bringing it to their boards, nor do I completely damn them for kicking him out, I understand where he's coming from, and why it seems a little shit that he was unable to get anything from the named that he worked for a great deal. <br>
