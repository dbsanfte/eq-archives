<br>
There is an individual - Break Dance (level 53ish Iksar Monk) who was recently booted from our guild for stealing.<br>
<br>
He stole a CoF from Nanok of Lightbringers.<br>
<br>
He is now claiming that this CoF droped from Naggy and he won it.<br>
<br>
I have some friends, RL and in-game who were there and assure me that no CoF dropped.<br>
<br>
Additionally I wouldn't mind hearing about any comments about said individual showing up at the raid for the first time at the Buff room, winning some gaunts or something then trying to get in on Naggy loot when he clearly couldn't participate in the battle as he would have been banished due to his level.<br>
<br>
This individual is of a dispicable disposition, and I want everyone on our server to know it so he is unable to repeat his vile actions. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=84239" target="_blank">Aramus Maximus</a><BR>

<br>
And I did allow him to join in the raid, around the time we were buffing. He had said he was lvl 52. Which would have provided another Melee against the dragon. Nothing ever was brought up to me about his true level or character until after Naggy was dead and loot was rolled on.<br>
<br>
I have already discussed WHY I allowed them on a seperate post. About the 9th post down.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=211.topic&start=1&stop=20">pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncil...=1&stop=20</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Last night ( 2/28 ) we had a Vox raid. Once again Break shows up. This time I was aware of his character and people also voiced thier opinions early on (unlike at Naggy). He asked if he could join. I said no. He asked if he could help even if he didnt roll on loot and I told him no, that people would be offended. He left it at that. I continued getting tells etc..with concerns of him NL Vox. I put in a petition just as we finished buffing as a forewarning that he was in the zone and many were worried about the situation, just in case something happened.<br>
<br>
He was in the zone when we were rolling for loot, although I never &quot;saw&quot; him throughout the evening. To my knowledge, Vox's corpse was intact.<br>
<br>
I can see him happeneing to be in the same zone as a raid going on... but twice in a row??? It seemed as if he was &quot;following&quot; us around... or maybe just anyone who had a large raid going on. Either way it did seems vulturistic to me and not a quality I want in a raider.<br>

after first hand witnessing some things, such as his behavior in DL, what happned at Nagafen 2/26/02, and then the addition of Anamar's comments... here's the deal...<br>
<br>
not only does he play multiple accounts at the same time ( not against verant rules ) but i ( <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> and this is my own suspicion, not a fact</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ) believe he is not only using 'Show EQ', but possibly another hack program...<br>
<br>
Break....if i am wrong, and your a victim of circumstance, i apologize, but i would not have posted this here without justifiable suspicions...<br>
<br>
Being /anon all the time raises my suspicions... as does lying to Azure about being level 52..<br>

Break is banned from any of the KCoG events i lead, untill i am proven wrong ... <br>

 If there is a hack, are there any steps to avoid it. Such as not using the standard 100-500? <br>

Once detected, your account is banned for life, and sometimes even your credit card that is being used is banned. And personally, i know break in real-life, i have always talked to him everyday, i don't know if the cof thing is just made up or not, but, still i think people accusing him is wrong, someone was told that they had their cof stolen by so and so. then that person spreads a rumor, not knowing if it is true. break has never had a cof before this rumor. i have checked his account, and nothing, no cof anywhere. i don't know where he got it from, but, people, make sure you can prove something before blaming someone on one person's word, otherwise, it is just wrong.<br>

I don't think that such a think exsits.  Some people just get lucky, you can't win every roll.  The only kind of &quot;hack&quot; I know is when someone tires to trick you by doing a shout, so the numbers are red, like a shout if you have not changed your defult colors, and have a macro set up to look like a high roll.<br>
<br>
Of course there are other things that people do to try and cheat, like using the wrong numbers, or rolling more then once.<br>

I had a rez request the other day.  When I got to the body I found out it was Break.  So I chatted with him a little bit.  He did admit, after initially implying he didn't know, that he was aware of this site.<br>
<br>
From what I see here and talking with him I don't trust anything he says.  I also believe he's fully aware of this discussion and isn't defending himself because there is no defense.<br>

Cynimon, my druid, was casting Circle of Winter on people in the buffline.  I noticed that Break con'd yellow to her (she's level 52, by the way), and commented on that to him.  He gave some particularly lame excuse about how he was going to take hits without fighting back or something equally as stupid - a tactic which would not work as he would be booted out as soon as Naggy saw him.  I didn't make that big a deal out of it because I was engaged in chat-room stuff on the machine that I run Kommisar from, and wasn't paying too close attention (except for buffing groups) to what was going on with Cynimon... and after having a few arguments with other raid members about issues like camping out, I didn't want to start a brand new argument with some brand new moron.<br>
<br>
Thinking back, I probably should have asked Azure if she knew Break was level 53 or higher.  I didn't.  I assumed that she already knew or didn't care.<br>
<br>
I won't let something like that go without comment in the future.  Neither should anyone else.  I'm sure Azure won't make the mistake of allowing someone on a raid without them going un-anon in the future (I kicked a few people off who either wouldn't do so, or admitted to being outside level requirements when pressed) - frankly, I can't blame her for taking Break at his word after all the other crap she had to put up with on that raid.<br>
<br>
But, while it is ultimately the raid leaders responsibility to make sure everyone on the raid is of suitable level, it is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> OUR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> responsibility as raiders to support the leader in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> every way that we can</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  If you see someone on the raid who you think shouldn't be there... tell your group leader.  If you are a group leader, tell the raid admins.<br>
<br>
Most of the people I booted off raids for being under- or over-level were brought to my attention by someone else on the raid... I think I only caught one of them myself.  Raid leaders need our support folks.  They aren't super-human. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for Break... he has most likely done himself more harm than anyone else.  It gets awefully hard to play the game when you have established a reputation so bad that most guilds won't take you in, give you a res, port, group with you, etc...<br>
<br>
Yeah sure, he may have a CoF and Gauntlets of Fiery might... but are those items worth the price of so many people dis-trusting you and being unwilling to help you? <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

You know what he did, you've informed everyone.... There is no reason to sit there and stalk him and inform everyone where he goes, is there?<br>
