 Is This where I am supposed to turn into Haisamma (sp) and ask you for your address? <br>
 Either way like I said. I am now the wiser and set forth my explanation before the rants began. What's more important to me is that people know I am original and not ebayed. Thanks once again. <br>
<br>
Your attitude on the matter just proves another point I have been making with other people. Don’t to turn your accounts over to your guild leaders or anyone else. When you hand your account over you think you are doing a good deed when in actuality you’re just creating more greed. Stick with what you got and don't get into the same mess as I did. <br>
<br>
Just boggles me that there are more greedy people like her in game. I would have assumed it would come from some noob or board troll and not someone who has been around who you think would understand that people quit and often come back.<br>
Re read the posts several times if you like and see if you actually made sense of it the first time because it doesn’t sound to me as if you understood or read the whole thing by making statements and questions that have already been answered here.<br>
<br>
Well I'm off of work now see you all in game. Ta Tah<br>

<br>
Anyone that doesn't understand that just doesn't want to accept the fact that you did wrong.  You tell yourself that you were justified in &quot;taking&quot; the account back.  The simple fact still remains that you had NO right to do so.  You stole the account back, nothing less.<br>
<br>
Your warning to other guild leaders to not give away accounts is laughable.  Selling or giving something away can't be taken back.  If you CHOSE to sell OR give the account away, then from that point on it did NOT belong to you.  So to right the wrong (in your head I guess), you decided to steal something back that didn't belong to you.<br>
<br>
You seem to be hung up on the issue of ebaying.  Unfortunately, that is not why any rational individual considers you scum.  You were the original owner of Xienna, praise the Lord!  Who cares?  The issue is not that you aren't the original owner, it's that you are a thief.<br>
<br>
Friendship with SoT:<br>
<br>
I, like most everyone else, and most of SoT considers what they did wrong.  I was very disturbed by what happened for a couple days.  After reading logs, posts, and talking to people in game, it was pretty obvious SoT acted on instinct (in this case their instinct that NB + SoT = racing/kiting/ksing).  They were wrong in their assumption, and needed to realize that and apologize for it.<br>
<br>
I consider many in SoT my friends, and I have a lot of respect for them.  After the RF steal, I was hoping they would come out and apologize...if they hadn't then there wouldn't have been any sign of remorse, and thus no reason for respect.  Whether it was Dwallyn's post or being forced into it, they apologized.  To most on the Rathe, they are damned if they do or don't anymore.  If they didn't apologize then people would hate them...when they did apologize people still hate them.  It's not easy to act when stuck between a rock and a hard place.  People either need to accept their apology, or don't accept it and move on.<br>
<br>
I've told Dwal and Galu both that I respect the decision they made.  It took a lot of guts to stand by their beliefs and fight back.  It's not really fair for people to think they were bad members or swine for leaving when they did.  Remember they had guild members bashing them and at that point very few members (if any?) that were on their side.  I can understand that it is honorable to stick with your guild during tough times, but why stick with a guild (at any time) if you have lost the respect of its members?  The sad part is why they lost the respect to begin with...because they posted their opinion.  If that is thought of as their &quot;mistake,&quot; then SoT should forgive Dwal and Gal (and ask forgiveness at the same time) the same way they want everyone to forgive them.  If some members (obviously not all) of SoT refuse to forgive Dwal and Gal for what they did, then they shouldn't expect anyone on the Rathe to forgive SoT.<br>
<br>
Lastly about SoT (the &quot;evil empire&quot;)...<br>
<br>
I have known many in SoT for over a year.  Shei was the first SoT I ever met and got to know.  I know many others from when they were in VoF, and met many others that have always been in SoT.<br>
<br>
They helped us kill Ragefire at a time where we stood no chance to kill him.  That was LONG before most of their clerics had epics, and like I said we would have had no chance...yet they came to help on a moments notice.<br>
<br>
They have given away countless no drop quest items that they could have just as easily kept for later.<br>
<br>
They gave me and many others multiple pieces of armor from ToV long before I (and others from bunches of guilds) could have ever gotten them.<br>
<br>
They have done CR for different guilds in almost every zone you can name.<br>
<br>
They changed their goals to become one of the top tier guilds, and because of that, people seem to forget or ignore the above.  All most see is the bad (usually thanks to this board) but never the good.  Most time the bad is all about how a mob can be killed by someone else before some other guild can get a shot at the next mob on the list.  Guilds want to succeed so naturally losing a shot at a mob gets frustrating, but the same can be said of anyone that plays this game.  Losing one of the 100 big mobs for a week is usually thought of to be such a bad thing, but I bet it's no different than the frustration someone fighting orcs in oasis feels if an orc is pulled before they can get to it...they just have to move on and find something else to kill.<br>
<br>
SoT is bashed and hated for needless reasons like just killing their share of mobs (don't tell me there aren't enough mobs out there for BotS/Tindi/NB/SoT to kill...every one of those guilds gets their share of big mobs per week).  Unfortunately, this one TRUE mistake they made makes people think they are just assholes and deserve to rot in hell.<br>
<br>
Before you decide that SoT is made of greed and their goal is to spite the Rathe, know that EVERYONE makes mistakes.  For whatever reasons, we ALL do it EVERY day.  SoT has done countless good deeds and will continue to do so.  Try not to judge them by their mistakes if you never intend or care to find out how often they do right.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion<br>

Me, Levlenna.<br>
You quit EQ due to some RL stuff. You wanted to cancel the account and not play again. So I asked you if you were not go to play again, if I maybe could buy the account, because I liked the toon, Xienna, very much.<br>
Then you told a few days later that it would be a naked toon because you sold all the equipment to fellow players. I said I didn't care and that if it was an empty toon, I wanted to at least pay you back for the CD's. So you sent me a bill for $100 through Paypall. I had to create an account there to pay you, and I did. You left EQ. Few days later your wife told me how you bought UO (I think it was) and that you were playing that, later on you played DAoC. Fine.<br>
The transaction with the accounts occurred july 2001. I reequiped Xienna, leveled her to 60 and had much fun than let another guildy play her who really really liked her. We payed the monthly fee and we bought Shadows of Lucin. Then in january you want it all back. 7 months later. <br>
I think the account was rightfully mine. you SOLD it. period. So when you asked the person who was playing her, he told you he liked the toon too much to just hand it back. <br>
Then you e-mail or phone verant and have the password reset.<br>
So not only you received $100 also you got SoL for free along with the equipment.<br>
When I send you mail that it would at least be fair to give me my money back, you threaten that you will have your friend do the same with the other account if I ever send you email again.<br>
Surprised you got no answer?<br>
And no, I did not start the flame war. You did.<br>
Thanks.<br>
Also I will not respond any further to this subject. I have learned my lesson. You seemed a nice guy at the time. I could not have been more wrong.<br>

And give back to your guild whatever you feel you didn't earn, but if you feel like you earned hell keep it, that would be like returning your pay check at work and saying &quot;Hey thanks for the money, I know I earned it but since I like you you can have it back.&quot; lol<br>

<br>
All the tradable items were given back to different VoF members in e com. Lev, as she said, never got with me so I dispersed all of it. Whether they gave it back to the guild or kept it I have no idea nor do I care. I also gave her an opportunity to get back what she &quot;sent&quot; that is true. She sent me money to cover CD costs of her own &quot;free will&quot;. I will admit that I didn’t take any thought into having SoL installed on my account and I will cover that as well. My intentions were not to rip anyone out money or loot. She handed my account over to Crockychips (level 60 epic necro RL friend of hers). The only items that were left on Xienna were no drop gear 1/2 which I attained while in VoF (thanks for pointing that part out). The extra items were PoG BP, and ToV boots and arms. I could have destroyed it, but I have switched factions and I am simply replacing it with CoV armor. Soon there will be nothing left which she acquired. As for as making a big stink about getting her 60 well she was already 1/2 through 59 and half way through 60 when I got her back. Thanks for 1 yellow bar. Her own guild members have sent me tells thanking me for taking my account back. She had been trying to Equip Xienna with gear for her own purposes while giving full time players the shaft on loot during raids. She is not as innocent as people think. She probably gets it from the SoT members out in Holland where they hang out. <br>
<br>
Now that Lev has made me realize that SoL &quot;was&quot; installed on the account. I guess I can send her 100$ &quot;donation&quot; back without having to return Nikkimus (the cleric account she also got from me which she logs on for her raids). Like I have stated before Nikkimus was not mine to begin with and I can't control whether he decides to have his password reset so the gamble is again on Lev in that matter.<br>
<br>
As for starting a flame war I think not. I simply posted on the original subject here knowing full on that you and Maly would come out of the woodworks. You are as predictable as my 7 year old. Not once did I or anyone else mention names or guilds here until you guys came lashing back out. Feeling bitter?<br>
<br>
I will have your money to you ASAP. Just don't think for a minute that everyone is a fool. At least I can come out and admit what I have done and not make up halve truths.<br>

Last time i checked, Outpost was still in Antwerp, Belgium, and NOT in Holland. I think The holland vof crew have only been there like once or twice.<br>

And Croky did not have epic when Xienna was sold to VoF. Nor is he Level 60.<br>

Lev hardly played Xienna as a matter of Fact, Croky did. and croky IS a fulltime player. During the time croky played X, Xienna was MA/MT on smaller raids.<br>

<br>
If you hang with a gang, you will be looked at as the gang is. Any organization in the world is like that. When you see someone wearing a blue police officer's uniform, you expect a certain sort of behavior.<br>
Right now, when people see the SoT tag, they are thinking of the shameful acts recently. No way around that. They are not being &quot;racist&quot;, they are relating incidents with an organization. <br>
If you don't like that, than either help change the guild's rep, or /guildremove. If you love the guild, make effort to change the public outlook toward it.<br>
As for ending friendships, and calling them fake. If I were in SoT, and my buddy tells me:<br>
&quot;Look man, you rock and all, but with what happened recently, I will not group up with SoT. Nor will I port/rez/sell/buy from them. Nothing toward you bro, just the actions of the guild&quot;<br>
That is not ending a friendship. That is a friend taking a MORAL stand for what they believe in. If YOU are a REAL friend, you will understand and know where to put blame for this. I personally would raise holy hell in /guild if something like this happened. I would make sure a massive change took place soon. If my friend was forced to make such a difficult decision due to my guild's actions, I have to put blame on the guild. (Especially when so many others seem to feel the same way.)<br>
<br>
So don't blame your friends. Be a real friend, and respect their moral decision. If it bothers you that much, make a change!<br>

<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
P.S. If my intentions were to get Xienna back it would have been done long ago seeing how I still have all the original info and CD keys.... <br>
seems like VoF is trying to reach a bit to far  <br>
Voltile Spinaltap The artist formerly known as Xienna <br>
----------------------------------------<br>
No no names here at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
Levlenna do you remember who logged on Volitile to help me multi my Jboots boots months ago? Hmmm could it have been Levlenna?<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
Nope. No names here either. And I helped you because I am so bad and I take all loot for myself from the guild, and I probably steal from SoT also, or make them give me items.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
Vryu Hadoken purchased Blaal Battroll<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Again no names.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Of course you post this after countless attempts to get Blaal from him which don't work so you try to ruin his name ... wtg. <br>
<br>
Soltari Raaptor<br>
Arch Mage<br>
Officer of Visionaries of Fire<br>
The Rathe server <br>
<br>
 <br>
Volitile Spinaltap<br>
<br>
Yep thats right.<br>
<br>
I rather see no Blaal than one that was equipped by true effort be used as a tool for Visionaries  <br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
No names at all. Never mentioned any.<br>
BTW, if you didn't get it yet by his signature: Volitile Spinaltap, the artist FORMERLY known as Xienna....<br>
Volitile is now Xienna (the stolen one)<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
I would hardly count giving Xienna and Nikimus to Lev E-baying she gave me 50 bucks out of her own free will just for my troubles. <br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
No names at all. And here it was 50 bucks, but wasn't it 100? Who is telling half the truth again?<br>
Oh wait, now people point out that you are simply a thief, you are going to give me back my money? Does that make you less of a thief?<br>
<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
Ok Ok<br>
So does Ebay ass licker who still admin the VoF boards sound better? LOL Lev should find better management. With no respect to you whatsoever you serve em more justice than I thought. har har<br>
<br>
btw when your done with your dads next session send your pal Mak a nice big /finger for me will ya?<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
I have never ever mentioned a name, never did I say it was Lev or VoF involved.... see?? no name at all. And ofcourse no insults either. Why would I       <br>
ehhmmmmm?? Xienna?? What's about all those names?<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
part of my own reply on those very boards concerning the Vryu/Blaal/Xienna thing:<br>
<br>
I flood you with e-mail?? huh?? ehh when?? You send me an e-mail 14 jan. I reply. You send me an e-mail again 17-1. I reply again. You send me an email the 21st. Again I reply.<br>
You send me 4 emails today which send me to this board. I have not replied you today by email.<br>
<br>
Here is a copy and paste of your latest of the 4 e-mails to me. so everyone will know what you are going to do.<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
You know what after careful consideration on what Malaka and Bog have <br>
brought up it might sound like a good idea anyway if you gave me back my old <br>
account. Take all your belongings and delete the no drop gear you guys got <br>
if you want off Xienna's account and I'll paypall you your 50$. You can keep <br>
Nikkimus for what its worth. After all is done you'll have my word that you <br>
will never hear from me again. Problem solved as long as they stay out of <br>
what does not concern them. Keep in mind I am not the one that came up with <br>
the idea you can take it up with them if you so desire. Also keep in mind <br>
you could run the risk of losing any other toons you or anyone else have on <br>
the same credit card you guys used to maintain your accounts if I report <br>
Xienna stolen.<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
Well, that's exactly what you did, STEAL Xienna.<br>
<br>
<br>
And part of your your reply:<br>
-----------------------<br>
Clever..<br>
-----------------------<br>
Yes, I am not the idiot you think I am.<br>
<br>
<br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
As soon as you got Xienna back, you went to House Calenture. Makmut asked you to return all the non no-drop items to me and pay plat for the no-drop items. You simply refused. A week after you were kicked out of HC.<br>
<br>
Now you are in League of Levity and play the *I am so nice guy*. Fine with me. Sooner or later they will find out what you REALLY are, if there EVER arises a problem, you will show your true nature to them also. <br>
<br>
Oh, and replacing your armor by other ToV armor, does that make it ok you stole it in the first place? but now that you don't use it anymore, it's no more stolen?<br>
<br>
<br>
Have fun Jeff (Xienna). <br>
<br>
I know I posted I would not reply anymore, but I think this makes it a bit more clear what we are talking about. And this is truely my last reply.  You can post whatever you like, what scum I am, how deceitfull, how I rip off my guild etc etc etc.<br>
We all know it isn't true and I have friends here that step up for me. I asked them also NOT to post here anymore about this issue. You say you have friends. I have NEVER seen anyone step up for you.<br>
<br>

I'm sorry to say but I don't agree with your stand nor Xrofts on because you &quot;hang out&quot; with people doesn't make you bad. I have tagged along on a couple SoT raids by invite of one of my friends. And at that time, and still am, attempting to join NB, and I have yet to have anyone from NB say &quot;well Nelly you hang with SoT, you must be bad news for NB so bug off&quot;. I don't have a problem with SoT at this present time, yes what they did wrong, and by they i mean those who actually participated in whatever the hell took place in Skyfire with Ragey. I see lots of SoT people running around Luclin and Norrath, I don't see anything bad about them, but thats because I don't let things like that effect my judgement for a single person. I have friends in every &quot;major&quot; guild on the Rathe. Because I'm associated with people from SoT or any of em I have yet to have anyone say anything wrong about me. If you assume because your associated with people in a guild, then you lack the ability to look past a tag (which was what my original post was about) and then your lose on possibly a good person friendship. Most people on the Rathe now have a biased mindset against SoT, which is a sad thing from my point of view. Nothing I can do, but the whole point was to not break of friendships because of a tag. If you know that person in SoT and they talk to you and have helped you or given you advice then you don't deserve that person's friendship. <br>
I hate sheep...<br>
PS. Would you please bickering about someone buying/selling there account on this post?? This thread was meant to express my opinions on the people wanting to break friendships because of a tag not about someone's past mistakes.<br>

<br>
  Brumpy yes a tag is LIKE (this a simile) a uniform, it identifies a person as a part of an organazation, when SOT/BOTS/TL/NB achieve something the members say, &quot;WE KILLED CT&quot; and are rightfully proud, so conversely when a guild does something wrong they should be collectively ashamed.You can't have it both ways if your are proud of a guilds acheivements, then you have to be ashamed by their ill deeds.Yes guilds are a collection of individuals, but a certain amount of individuality is given up much like when a person joins a sports team or a club.<br>
<br>
  I Never endorsed harrassing people or hating them for wearing a tag I just stated that when you wear a tag you are identified by it to a degree.<br>
