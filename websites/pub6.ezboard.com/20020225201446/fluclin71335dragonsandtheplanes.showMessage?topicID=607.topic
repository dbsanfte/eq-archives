More than half the days either PoF or PoH is available (pick up raids, baby!).  Weekends suck a bit, but not much you can do about that.  Was one of the new rules allowing only one posted weekend raid?  If so, I like that one.<br>
<br>
Naggy + Vox to list, good idea.  Calendar is a bad spot for them.<br>
<br>
48 hours on lists?  Bad idea.  Remember, the amount of time you're given to kill them isn't *preparation time*, it's *oh god we suck we need to try again and again and again time*.  Preparation time is keeping in touch with who's above you on the list and finding out exactly when the spawn died, paying attention to messages on upcoming patches, etc.<br>
<br>
Not including patches, the 48 hour limit effectively takes away 16 of the 52 Naggy/Vox spawns a year.  And I have a feeling most people will actually use most of that time just because people are lazy.  Do you really want 30% less of a chance of getting a Cloak of Flames, a White Dragon Scale, a Torbin's Eyepatch?  I'll take all the chances I can get.<br>
<br>
Vox &amp; Naggy, 24 hours at most in my opinion.  That's, on average, EIGHT DAYS of preparation time.  At the very least it's TWO DAYS of preparation time.<br>
<br>
Getting used to a 24 hour limit would be good since most of the bigger stuff you'll end up making agreements on later will be 24 or even 12 hour limits.<br>
<br>
The uber mobs in Kunark are already basically on a list.  The problem with making this list open for anybody to jump in is lots of lost spawn time I guess.  Probably best, for now, to simply contact the people you know are killing the mob and attempt to get a shot.  Once you can prove that you can either kill or come close to killing them, simply ask to be put into rotation.<br>
<br>
Closing thoughts..<br>
<br>
It's Verant's job to enforce PnP.  It's our opportunity to never let it get that far.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I'm watching you open raid people closely (remember, I'm one of the biggest advocates of open raids).  If I see these open raids being cancelled too much, being traded or otherwise abused, your posts on the calendar are going to start disappearing. <p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#000000"><tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><img src="http://everquest.estoncom.com/noj/images/bishsign1.gif" border="0" alt="Get yer foul tallard mouse cursor OFF OF ME!"></td><td rowspan="2" align="center"><font color="#FFFFDD" size="1" face="tempus sans itc">and...</font><br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=44611"><font color="#29FF29" face="tempus sans itc" size="3">Kraket</font></a><br><br><font color="#8888FF" face="tempus sans itc" size="2">The<br>narcoleptic <br>lizard</font></td></tr><tr><td align="center" colspan="2"><a href="http://pub30.ezboard.com/bnuggetsofjustice"><font color="#FF0042" face="tempus sans itc" size="2">~ Nuggets of Justice Message Board ~</a></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=3814"><font face="tempus sans itc" color="#0024FF" size="2">Level 52 Vicar</font></a></td><td align="center"><a href="http://pub30.ezboard.com/fnuggetsofjusticefrm3.showMessage?topicID=14.topic"><font color="#00F824" face="tempus sans itc" size="2">Want List</font></a>  </td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usorrowsend.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorrows End</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/15/01 3:36:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=607.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /raise.</span><hr size=1>     I abuse the calender!

It's great people are trying to work together and plan and schedule raids. No problem here...<br>
<br>
The problem is after that... When the rules and guidelines come in. Players that don't have the right trying to govern the server take it upon themselves without Verant's permission. That in itself is causing the problems. _NOT_ The players stepping on the raid calendar rules. NO player has to follow these rules. These rules shouldn't even be here in the first place.<br>
<br>
I hope you, Bish, and whoever else is responsible for the raid calendar realize how much anger it's caused people. EVERY time someone's stepped on someones toes with the raid calendar thing, broke the raid calendar rules, ect ect was no their fault at all. It's all your guys'... I'm not saying the raid calendar shouldn't be here, but I am saying the raid calendar rules and people trying to make rules and guidelines shouldn't even be considered, or here in the first place.<br>
<br>
When players accept the 'Everquest agreement and software licesce' thingy upon entering the game, we don't agree to any of this. I know you guys aren't trying to stir up trouble at all, and only trying to make things go smoother... But ask yourself who's REALLY at fault here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubicrius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bicrius</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 357<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/01 2:24:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=607.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://students.hamilton.edu/2002/bschulte/eqpics/bicanime.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: MY thoughts...</span><hr size=1> Hmmm... funny, I only see one person who has a problem with it. But just out of curiousity, if noone has to follow 'guidelines' that representatives from all large guilds except LOS were there to help create and accept, then why follow the calendar either? I mean, it's a 'rule' that you should post your raid on the calendar, and it's a 'rule' not to have a raid during someone else's time. Makes me curious... the calendar has 2 main 'rules' as I see it. First, post the date and time of when you want to have your raid. Fairly simple, not hard. Second, don't post a raid at the same place at the same time as someone else, because that's their reserved time and place. That also seems simple and fair.<br>
<br>
What has followed is 'guidelines' of how the calendar should be used above and beyond those simple 2 'rules'. Most of these 'guidelines' have been in place for some time now, and noone had had too much of a problem with it, and some have deviated from it from time to time, but on a whole it's worked well and has been <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> fair to all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
Now, that the council of guild's has come back into action, everyone can come and have a chance to rework and tweak the 'guidelines' so that they are as fair as possible to every individual and guild on the server. Quite frankly, I think pushing for fairness and an equal chance is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> good thing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
The problem is that this stuff is difficult to work out on a message board, and better off done in a meeting where everyone is there in real time and can have the floor to speak where everyone will hear them at that very second. In messageboards, people pick and choose what to read, if to read at all- thus they miss lots of important stuff that makes them have incomplete info to make assumptions and oppinions with. <br>
<br>
Thus, it is my conclusion that the council of guilds (and individuals are allowed of course... what the hell do you think this is bougeious of only the powerful and privalleged in guilds?) is a good thing, and something that everyone who wants to be involved in should be involved in. The voices and knowledge of the many are the key to the answer for the whole. Farming guilds and groups that dominate whatever plane/uber mob they want <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is wrong and a thing of the past</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->... Everyone has a shot now, the way it should be. Free and equal, where everyone has a say. Is there something wrong with that, honestly?<br>
<br>
PS. Verant's stance on everything is none-involvement, unless people are being harrassed, abused, or they're abusing flaws in the game. Verant doesn't support or enforce calendars, but they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>NEVER</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> said that we couldn't organize them ourselves. They probably never even thought that a server would organize enough to create something like a serverwide council open to all. And quite frankly, I'm sure they can't/won't/wouldn't want to do anything about it. They'd probably be tickled pink to see everyone working together and solving their own problems rather than acting like asses and petitioning all the time.<br>
<br>

People have said you can just do a &quot;/who all XXX&quot; to see if a plane is being raided.  That just doesn't work.  Last time I checked, &quot;/who all fear&quot; doesn't work.  But maybe if everyone was issued a list of all the guilds that go to the planes and force them to be non-anon it would work.  Oh, sorry, forcing people to be non-anon isn't part of Verant's rules.<br>
<br>
It still amazes me the number of people who want to abolish a system just because the system isn't perfect.  In this case specifically, we want to abolish a system that by far is solving more problems than it is creating.  That is just moronic.<br>
<br>
But like Deris said in another post, some people are just closed minded and refuse to see reality.<br>

You don't think the toes would have been stepped on without the calendar?  Two groups of people contesting ANYTHING will cause friction, and to blame a calendar for that is laughable.  The calendar is there to minimize this sort of BS; as long as people who do NOT respect it are out there, toes will be stepped on, simple as that.  <br>
<br>
You don't want rules?  What happens when a guild wants to farm Hate for their epics?  They should be allowed to book all the slots on the calendar, just to &quot;let everybody know their intentions&quot;?  We just had a problem with open raids filling the calendar; how did we solve that problem?  A &quot;rule&quot;, so toes wouldn't get stepped on.  We had a guild book Hate for every Saturday until May (though I believe it was an accident).  How did we solve that?  We invoked the 3 posting &quot;rule&quot;, so no toes would get stepped on.  No, those rules aren't enforceable, but through consideration and a desire to work together, problems were avoided.<br>
<br>
There aren't enough toes in the game to handle the stepping that would happen without some sort of guidelines.  Blaming the calendar guidelines for inconsiderate behaviour is like blaming the law for people robbing banks.  Well, if there wasn't a law against it, he wouldn't be doing any wrong, would he?<br>

Really getting frustrated with the level of intelligence some of the people have on this server.  They are all afraid that something is being taken away from them, when in fact it is trying to be made better for them.<br>
<br>
/heavy sigh<br>
<br>
I am doing everything in my power not to go off anymore about this subject.<br>
<br>
I for one love the calendar.  It shows some form of organization and thought for others when coming to Radis etc.  It has worked great for the times I have used to post guild raids on zones like MM, Unrest, RE, etc.<br>
<br>
As with anything it is going to take time to work things out.  However the lack of being openminded by some folks who refuse to see both sides, myself included sometimes,  is what is the real root of this problem.<br>
<br>
IMHO, Verant has left how we run our server up to us as long as it does not cause harm to anyone. (I think that Bicrius mentioned something about this)  We are the society.<br>
<br>
I say if push comes to shove we just get one big multi- guild war going and last guild standing from whatever side controls how things on the server are set up.  At least that is how I feel about it at this time.  Now tomorrow I may be all fired up again and ready to take on the people that oppose the guidelines that have been set up for the calendar etc.<br>
<br>
Bish,  Keep up the great job on the Calendar, do not abandon it.  Things will work out.<br>

<br>
Bic, I think it's rather rude and untrue of you to say all representatives of all guilds except LOS were part of making the rules and guidelines.  The guidelines as I read them looked a lot like the things we had all been discussing on the board for a long time, one of the rules in particular looked almost exactly like a certain person who's name starts with a U's input to these boards.  I also believe a lot of guilds were not present at the council, It's certainly not a bad idea to meet and talk from time to time, but if there were 50 people there all trying to talk it might not go as well and you can miss stuff.  The message boards are still a great way to discuss these things and should not be ignored for a council of guilds to decide rules.  And in fact I believe the actual intent of the council of guilds was to create guidelines as a basis for discussion on the message boards.<br>
<br>
P.S. nobody needs Verant's permission to set up any guildelines, it's up to us to create and follow or not follow whatever guidelines we wish.  Only rarely does a GM step in to enforce a PnP policy, I can only remember one major situation myself.<br>

But, I was just stating that the majority of the 'larger' guilds were there. But, as I've said before, I wish more were there. There issue of everyone talking at once is no problem, Milynna does a good job explaining how it works, and how only one person at a time gets to have the floor and use shout. It's actually quite organized. Whenever the next one is, you should come by and give it a look-see! <br>

<br>
Farming guilds and groups that dominate whatever plane/uber mob they want is wrong and a thing of the past... <br>
<br>
I wish people would stop making claims such as this, it's been going on a long time now and it's probably not your fault for buying into it.  There was never a time when anyone forcibly took control of the server not allowing anyone else to do things.  we always ask for evidence but nobody provides it.  I also wish people would refrain from calling people who do stuff like that newbies, it's not that they are new to the game, it's just that they weren't around when this all started and missed all the previous attempts at a solution.  I don't know if this is your first character on the server or not Bic, if it is you probably missed the fact that Bish's statement<br>
<br>
Probably best, for now, to simply contact the people you know are killing the mob and attempt to get a shot. <br>
<br>
is very similar to Brizah's statement that got her pretty much flamed off of the server. (Except I think Large pointed that out to everyone a few weeks ago).  <br>
<br>
Avoid the blanket statements and labels that fly around about LoS and hopefully you will avoid people wrongfully labeling you.  Please remember that people on both sides have been trying to work on this stuff for a long time and many have gotten sick of it and given up.  I hope not everyone has, it's good to see Segal back in the fray and other people who left it a long time ago.<br>
<br>
But after all that rambling, I disagree that the council is the best way to voice opinions.  You must make the meeting or your voice is not heard.  The message board gives everyone the chance to be heard as long as they get in on the first few pages before the stupid stuff starts.<br>

Whatever rules we set today will change in a few months, that's the way it should be.  It is up to people then to follow/not follow and/or complain as they see fit.  Regardless of the complaints however, I'll bet you our system for all it's faults is working a heck of a lot better than what I am hearing from friends on other servers.  Believe it or not LoS doesn't go looking for people to step on, Elitists/Vagrants on my old server does.  the same might be said of KGC but I don't know the Karana politics like you all do so I won't say it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=luclinkarmic>LuclinKarmic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/01 2:31:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=607.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lol too fast for me</span><hr size=1> was supposed to be 2 consecutive posts but you snuck in, glad to hear it though, I certainly misunderstand things myself all the time, comes with the territory I guess <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulorrux.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lorrux</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/16/01 3:52:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=607.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Also</span><hr size=1> you have to look at why the server had the CoG meeting in the first place. I think it came about because of the overuse of Open Raids, people saw a issue which needed addressing, hence the meeting. Lack of attendance either says you are disinterested or perhaps had other things to do. I don't think the folks at the meeting had other ulterior motives and while the decisions made I don't completely agree with, they were done in a completely democratic fashion. <br>
<br>
When people invoke PNP that usually is a last straw, no other compromise can be worked out type of situation. The calendar ensures that we don't come to that. The calendar just ensures that guilds like Apex and LOS(who I have no beef with) aren't able to monopolize the spawns. What goes on in the planes, can't be compared with what goes on elsewhere cause they are seperate situations. <br>
<br>
Last, it's fair to have open debates by all means. I only ask to not skew one point without offering anything valid in place of that. I other words, saying the calendar sucks monkey balls, blah-blah while never giving me or the rest of the folks on the server a example of how FFA or any other system might work. I have played on Luclin for a year and on Cazic Thule for a month before coming here back in Jan. 2000 so I'll admit not being familiar with the practices of other servers but I've heard some not so pretty stories and hope Luclin will evolve for the better.<br>

Simply because a calendar system has failed numerous times in your experience Deris, does not necessarily mean it will fail on Luclin.  However perhaps the Calendar will die at some point...but not now. The Calendar continues to serve a good purpose, one of facilitating communication between many Luclin guilds and groups.  As long as the Calendar remains a valuable communication tool for many Luclin players, it will remain.<br>
