Just in case there was some confusion, when someone <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>asks</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>permission</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it usually indicates that they will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>respect</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>reply</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, have some <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>consideration</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for those they are asking, and not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ignore</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the answer if it didn't suit them. <br>
<br>
Don't pretend to care what the answer to a question is, when you have already decided what you are going to do. <br>
<br>
If you are going to race, bless you and good luck. If you are going to race no matter what the answer is, don't jerk people off by bothering to ask. <br>
<br>
The obvious implication to asking, is that you intend to abide by the reply. If I wanted a reach around, I'd volunteer for 'woman duty' at my local prison. <br>

Its in our rights to race you (even after asking) and we decided that we didn't care what you said.  If you wanted it that much, you'd be there killing it.  It was ready on tuesday night.  We had enough online when we asked.  This wasn't let us have a shot late tonight.  Courtesy, it seems, doesn't always pay off.<br>
<br>
As it were, (and for the record I am not blaming anyone in CB) when we got to SSRA, someone had killed some of the taskmasters and we had to wait 40 minutes.  Funny that it seemed just over an hour after we said we would race you.  If it were you guys, that is the lowest of all fucking lows.<br>

You even gave us some breathing room and trained us from left.  I guess those details evaded your scarey officer powers, as well as the fact that the last Rhoz wasnt up and another guild was forming for emperor or some other large mob, so we decided to move on rather than crowd the zoneline and lag everyone to hell.  We figured to get a shot on Wednesday. <br>
<br>
Maybe if you checked into the G/E/C rotation you'll see that we have actually been up for them no less than 2 weeks.  We were asked by another guild last week in a timely fashion for a shot, and we happily agreed. <br>
<br>
Also, if you take that big fat dick outta your high riding ass, you'll figure out that CB wouldnt gank the TM's to delay you because that would mean being in the basement on a rotation attempt which would be a violation of the RTA and also claiming camp for CB cause we would have posession of the basement, denying you entrance.<br>

Bullshit, I had a tracker in there all fucking night Tuesday, and the mob popped at 12:07am mst to complete the cycle of all mobs being up on *WEDNESDAY*.<br>
<br>
As for asking us to get a shot at a mob the day we're up for it, fuck off.  If you ask in a civil manner, with a few days notice (like EotF did)  you'll never get a no.  Time allows us to change our plans.<br>
<br>
GG you on winning the race.  That's what races are about.  Fuck for not having the respect for us to either a) give us more fucking notice on asking (even 24-36 more hours would have got you a yes) or b) abide by our saying 'no' because we were already getting set up to do it that night.<br>
<br>
So, in closing, you can:<br>
<br>
/target self<br>
/goto corner<br>
/sit<br>
/gofuck<br>
<br>
and if that wasn't clear enough, go sit in a corner and fuck yourself, Kranok. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=beathhail>beathhail</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/2/03 1:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1397.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Some definitions that might help some people...</span><hr size=1> /sigh <br>

There's a little thing called respect and courtesy. If you cant respect others and act with courtesy towards them then please don't expect any from now on.<br>
<br>
You want to race? Fine, tell us and good luck to you.<br>
<br>
You want to ask for a shot a mob? Ask in advance, Rog is a pud  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and never (or at least hardly ever) refuses anyone.<br>
<br>
Asking and ignoring an answer you didnt like is at best rude and at worst childish.<br>
<br>
You might have tried taking a look at the history page before you asked- we just gave EotF their shot so good manners might have surgested either -<br>
<br>
a) letting a guild that just gave somone a chance a go at their own mob.<br>
<br>
b) asking before the evening that the mob was due- honestly, you know CB, when have we ever refused somone a shot when they had the courtesy to ask us ahead of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If you wanted it that much, you'd be there killing it.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, it wasn't ready on tuesday, as some asshat had killed the main trigger mob causing us to sit in ssra rotting for 2 hours before we decided to go kill somthing else. Of course you should know that allready from the CE members in ssra on Tuesday, you know, the ones that trained us as we were gathering.<br>
<br>
As to the remark about killing TM's- fuck you and fuck your implication, anyone in CB who did that would be GR'd in an instant.<br>

Or, you can actually let the guild ahead know a couple of days in advance and show some respect for others.  This was a particularly heavy rotation week for CB, had you asked, it would have been a blessing to give you a shot in advance.  But without any advance, you basically commited people to be online for an event that would not take place.  Like you, we are not a large guild, we need to plan our events to make sure we have the numbers present.  Show respect for others and you will find that they will show respect for you.  That is all what this post was about, nothing more.<br>

Yes, frankly, should you or anyone else, in the future, not care about what our answer will be when you ask the question, please, do just go ahead and do it. At least your lack of respect for anyone other than yourself wouldn't be quite so apparent. <br>
<br>
That said, and I'm going to be crystal fucking clear here:<br>
<br>
At any time a guild wishes to attempt a rotation mob that CB is up for, if you give us an appropriate amount of notice, so that people do not rearrange their schedules to be online for *nothing* you will <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> get told no, just like when we have asked with reasonable notice we have never been told no. <br>
<br>
I don't hold people to standards that I would not hold myself to: On any occasion that we have asked on short (or advance) notice and been refused, we respect that we asked, and not demanded. <br>
<br>
Next time, you're right, if you're going to ignore any answer you don't want to hear, don't ask. <br>

This server has become way too much like a fucking Waltons episode if there is something wrong with that.<br>
<br>
Granted, maybe you didn't like it but to call it disrespectful is over the top imo.<br>
<br>
To bring something like this to FC is just plain vindictive and shows much less class (Sorry Rogg - I am a big fan but this was a worthless flame) than racing to a mob after you have been denied permission by the guild due up next.  How is that wrong?  Racing has always been a fair way to get on rotations.  If a guild not on the rotation wants to sit and camp out with their entire guild so they can kill it (or its PH's)when it spawns, they are well within their right to do so.  Albiet the timeframe was short, but since they are not required to ask you in the first place, that isn't a real pertinent point.<br>
<br>
And :<br>
