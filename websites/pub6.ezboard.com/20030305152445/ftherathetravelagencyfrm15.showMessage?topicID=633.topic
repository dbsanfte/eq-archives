I got a tell the other night from one of Grimus's RL friend, defending him.<br>
Here is some of the things Mistagrim said to me.<br>
<br>
[Mon Jul 08 00:05:36 2002] Mistagrim tells you, 'So you think this other person could have logged onto grimus without him knowing'<br>
[Mon Jul 08 00:20:33 2002] Mistagrim tells you, 'Actually I do know that he wouldnt, Ive known him for a very long time and he is a real honest person and would tell the trut <br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Jul 08 00:28:20 2002] Mistagrim tells you, 'I think what was said was grimus met drache once or twice. he never said that he knew him'<br>
- Unless Drache/Spiel/innsanicon  happened to be an acquaintance in the same guild as Grimus. More than likely they know each other well. I've even seen Innsanicon and Grimus in Najena together in the same guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
Be extra careful for either Drache and his alts; Innsanicon/Wodin/Spiel/Haunt/Taijitsu. He's a greedy weasel that will try to make friends with you, then take your stuff. Talking to Drache, being a coward he is... pretends to be another person on and acts like he's just got the game. A level 56 Shadow Knight that is new...  <br>
<br>
Grimus... you may not have the items, but your account was involved with stealing the items. The logs and pictures there shown that you traded with Tirent. Care to explain that? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bottom Line is: Never hand out your info for ANY Reason at all... Corpse Run, Rezzes and Etc. It will bite you in the arse and you will regret it. Like I have. <p> <b><li>The Wandering Slacker of Norrath</li></b>

<br>
It was from another post &quot;Watch out for Grimus the lying Thief&quot;<br>
Wodin/drache/spiel/Innsanicon was the only person who had Tirent's account info, asked to go login and Rez one of his buddies corpses. Thats the day when the items were gone.<br>
<br>
After the day the items were missing, Wodin started acting like he was someone else. One time when he was on Drache, I asked how he was. His response was &quot;I dont know&quot; Another time when he was on his chanter; Innsanicon. He claimed he was new to the game and claimed how nice people were treating him. <br>
<br>
I've known Wodin for quite sometime, at least seven or eight months. Back when he had Drache  level 20 in the Overthere.<br>
<br>
All I can say is that Wodin was the only other who could log on Tirent that day and traded items to Grimus. After that incident he has been very evasive and used the &quot;I'm someone else&quot; trick trying to get me to believe that he's not who he is.<br>
Either Wodin sold his guy or gave it to another friend, pretended it was the original and decided to take Tirent's stuff. This person is not the same anymore. <p> <b><li>The Wandering Slacker of Norrath</li></b>

<br>
My point is someone i knowned for so long and hes played so many hours on lvling toons and he never asked me for one single item. He earns his own money in EC with potions he makes with shaman.<br>
<br>
He does have friends that use his account once in a while to farm gear for thier own toons. You guys should get more facts together before flaming him like this here. I havent had time to talk to him since i saw this. I'll get to the bottom of this.<br>

<br>
I knew Wodin/Drache for quite sometime as well, when he had his Shaman in the 40's in OT. He would not be like the person who would do such a thing. But now he doesnt even talk to me, even before I started accussing him of logging in and taking the items.<br>
<br>
At first I did not want to belive that it was him that logged on to my cleric and cleared all the dropable items on him. I'd figured that first it was some sort of joke...I even gave a tell to him days after the incident.<br>
He was evasive and did not reveal that if he was the oringal owner of the account or one of his RL friends he let on to his account.<br>
<br>
Even if it wasn't Drache but his friend that did, why wont he try to fix or say something about the items that were taken? <br>

I've also trusted Drache with 10kpp to transfer it, he followed through honestly and even joked about how he already spent it on a silvery belt of contention. But now it seems to be a diffrent Drache....<br>

I don't need people like you in my life so I add your alts to my ignore list. After all this time I pass tons of items back and fourth to your alts (including 10K in cash), you treat me this way? I do not play Grimus, I do not know how to hack people, I only know how to play EQ, and get free music/movies/porn. I'm not out to do anything except that so STFU and stop threatening that &quot;a GM can trace the ISP that a character was logged onto&quot; and DO IT ! Please do it you retarded little mental case ! And I refuse to take your apology when you find out that I am not involved in your crappy little items being missing. I sit in EC the last 2 hours of my night everynight to buy/sell/trade things to make cash. I'm not worried about you and your shouts because the GM said just to /report you and it will record the last 10 lines of typed material and your slandering of my character will come to an end. Play rough and you go down kid. You make a character named &quot;Drachesuxxors&quot; and give me a tell and talk you BS, phuck you kid i'm tired of being nice to pissy little geeks like you. Think REALLY hard about the things you have Emailed me, I could use some of that material to tear down your reputation but i'm not a feeble little whiney biatch like you so I go on living my life and playing EQ and /reporting your ghey ass when you create characters and call me a faggot. Didn't you know that you can delete a character and a GM still has info that it was created at one point? I dare you keep making the fag remarks and all your little &quot;highschool&quot; antics. I NEVER ever for any reason ask a player to borrow cash or items because I would feel like its always in the back of his mind if hes going to get the item back so I don't get involved mixing money and friends together. How many hours do you think I spend a week in EC ? I would estimate 15ish a week. I hate you for saying i'm a thief, I bust my ass sitting there and staring at words fly by to find something cheap I can resell to build up my bank account. So until you can get computer material to get info about how I did this then STFU and  pursue a different person because I will fight back bitchboy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utherealdrache.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TheRealDrache</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/18/02 1:55:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=633.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Innsanicon = Drache?</span><hr size=1>  Your turn, come on !

If anyone WAS accused of stealing things in a matter Wabba described it, that person would investigate on what happened, possibly petition themselves and defend themselves on a professional level; <br>
<br>
As of right now Mr. Drache you sound like a little punk kid caught doing something wrong and do allot of screaming hoping people will just get annoyed and leave you alone...<br>
<br>
Well, id suggest you doing some investigation, talking, petitions... log them on, take screenshots and come back here to present yourself because as of right now your reputation isn't any better than it was before you started posting... <br>
<br>
Maybe you don't realize it, but your reputation does matter later on, unless of course you do love EC so much that you can buy everything, not to mention You will end up sitting in that EC all by yourself if you get my drift.<br>

I would recommend taking Vhalis' advise. <br>

  I don't care who wants to post in this, go for it. Have you ever had someone think you did something and you didn't? Didn't it make you feel like you were betrayed? Well, I grow tired of explaining myself to people that I shouldn't give a @#%$ about if they are going to be closed minded and keep this fire lit.<br>
  Sorry Vhalis, but i'm not going to play Perry Mason because I don't have time to discover who  the real killer is. Maybe you would take time out to do it, but I don't care about someone who doesn't  care about feelings enough to start tossing out accusations. High School is over, i'm living my own life. I have no more time to play on with this &quot;Flaming&quot; thing anymore. <br>
  I have a temper and I probably shouldn't be so quick to tear people down but theres nothing worse than people making me into Frankenstein over some bullshit drama. If I offended anyone besides Wabbajack, then I will write you you an E-Mail appologizing for my adult language and I will have Mickey Mouse and Snoopy sign the @#%$ for me.<br>
  If I become a prick then so be it, I refuse to play this &quot;Oh you must be guilty because you don't send a full scale investigation and find out who stole a couple gay little newbie items from a kid who slanders you and degrades your character because hes engry. Wabbajack should be mad and want to find out  who took his things but not attack someone he &quot;thinks&quot; could have taken it. <br>
   And by the way, there is no &quot;new player formerly known as Drache&quot;. I didn't sell the account or some other run of the mill, weak ass idea thats pulled out of Wabbaspank's feeble mind. Give this another week and you will find some other @#%$ to gossip about, I will be old news and you will grow tired of this pre-pubescent kiddie @#%$, I promise.<br>
  Btw, do you like my new sentence structure and paragraphing and correct spelling of things? Yeah I decided to be the ass you want me to be and spell out the &quot;curse&quot; words as you call them. /Powercry off &lt;Hit Enter&gt;<br>
  Notice Wabbajack isn't posting anymore responses yet? Maybe it's you fucks that are dragging this on. Just like any &quot;Flame post&quot; you people carry @#%$ too far. Anyone who wants to make characters with dumb names to avoid /report, then go for it. I have an ignore list and I have ALOT of slots left. So, whats next? More harassment? More tells with racial comments? More &quot;Flaming&quot; me? Go for it, you only entertain yourselves and I have alot of friends and only a couple enemies ( All Wabba's friends /sigh. )<br>
  I used alot of badboy, Innoruuk language. You people might not want me to post anymore, all I will do is be &quot;the bad guy&quot; of the RTA. I have enough fuel in me to carry on for hours about stupid ass peons that want make some BS talk in a &quot;rumors chat site&quot;. Are we going to play pingpong with our dicks all night or stop this bullshit? <br>
  Come on people, if I sat around and made rumors about a certain person/guild, and showed no proof of it, would you drool at the chance to flame them? Yes I think (some) of you would. The rest would be mature enough to journey onward with their lives and not play into this stupid @#%$. Yeah it was fun to burn him but now i'm feeling bad about the heavy frontal nuclear assault, because he is a victim as well. I picture him being mad, lashing out, and now still has no gear, gets flamed, and now has a battle on his hands.<br>
  Wabbajack, after tonight I will think more about how your feelings were hurt and I shouldn't have dropped the bomb on you but... I have a bad temper and a man is innocent till proven guilty because im in USA now and thats my right while I live here. I'm not  just some &quot;German Veetard&quot; as you put it before. BTW, &quot;W&quot; is pronounced &quot;V&quot; not an &quot;R&quot; as retard is spelled,@#%$. <br>
  You can teach a man to be smart, but you cannot teach him his own attitude. Mine happens to be excellent to people who are honorable, and foul and disgusing to ignorant slanderers.<br>
