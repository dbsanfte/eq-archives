<br>
Noble Blade's limited interest in the AoW has no bearing on the situation: When Clan Bashemded attempts the AoW, I want to get on the rotation with as little hassle to the guilds already on it, and after we are on the rotation, I want other guilds to enter the rotation with as little hassle to us. <br>
<br>
If/When you kill the AoW, it will be nice for the next people to not kill 2/3/4 AoW's before your turn again. <br>
<br>
The entire conversation is about a balance between guilds on, and guilds off who are looking to get on the rotation. It has nothing to do with noble blade's limited interest, or VoF, or United Necros. It has to do with people offering valid suggestions that seem entirely reasonable. <br>

<br>
Please, tell/show me of ANY time where NB has either passed AoW or left him stand more than 24 hours and we were up for rotation?  <br>
<br>
To make it easy here is a link to the rotation history:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/RotationDetail.asp?ID=5">www.jakefitch.com/rta/Rot...l.asp?ID=5</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
You keep going on about how Idol was up for a week?  When was this?  Who was up for him at the time?  And if he was up for that long why didn't YOU make an attempt at him?<br>
<br>
As for why I proposed waiting at least 2 spawnings between attemps was for simple curtosy for the guilds that are on the rotation.  Not just currently, but those that will be on the rotation in the future.  This isn't about VoF trying to get on the AoW rotation... this is about any guild trying to join any rotation where the mob despawns on failure.<br>
<br>
Lets say you do kill AoW next time, and get on the rotation.  Will you then want another guild despawning AoW every other spawn until they get on?  Would you want say Clan Bashemded poofing AoW every other week for 5 attempts until they finally win?  Or do you think it might be a bit nicer to the guilds on the rotation, to wait 2 spawnings before trying again.<br>
<br>
As for where 2 spawnsings came from, thats the minimum wait EVERY guild that is on AoW rotation currently between thier attempts (until recently).  <br>
<br>
BotS had to wait 2-3 weeks between thier first attempts because at that point Aow was triggered off Statues death (no Idol), so they could only attempt AoW on thier Statue kill.  (They did have a few attempts off other guilds Statue kills, but coordinating these was a very difficult process.)<br>
<br>
NB's first AoW attempt was after the Idol was added (the easy Idol), which we failed on (someone else killed Statue, but BotS hadn't gotten around to killing AoW yet).  Our second was 2 spawnings later on our Statue kill, and we won that time.<br>
<br>
SoT had a few failed attempts on thier Statue turns before the Idol was added.  Then when they did kill AoW after Idol was added, it was on thier Statue kill.<br>
<br>
When Tindi started trying for AoW is when the rule of only making attempts on your own Statue turn was first actually voiced.  I believe at this point there was 5 guilds on Statue rotation even.  (At least there was before Tindi successfully killed AoW.)<br>
<br>
So every guild that was on the AoW rotation, had a wait of 3-5 weeks between thier attempts.  I can agree that only 1 attempt per Statue rotation is too long a wait... and I'll even agree that a 3-5 week wait is too long for a rule.  Hence my suggestion of 2 spawning wait between attempts. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milambus>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 876<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/19/02 9:32:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/profile/fist1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: About VoF AOW attempt last week : </span><hr size=1> As for the rules not being posted in the Etiquette... truthfully I thought they were there.

I am not lying on this, we were at a point where we needed vindi BPs a lot, and we were killing vindi nearly everyday for like 2 weeks. Lev even posted what was happening with AOW rotation at that moment. Why we didnt try AoW at that moment? because we would have failed, we are now AoWable thanks to the new PoP levels and spells.<br>
<br>
As for waiting 2 pops, well, after thinking of it, it is indeed what other guilds that are on AoW rotation had to wait with a few exceptions, and it *seems* fair. Again as i replied on the thread in general, i am not a VoF rep on RTA, Nycah just gave me voice because i started the thread and she moved it here, so what i sat wont be VoF last word. but i think it is fair.<br>
<br>
Our main concern was that a guild tried 2 AoW within a week, and noone told them not to, but When we wanted to do the same, we were told not to, and we didnt like this double standard. <p><center><b><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=156296">Malaka's Profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malakarude>MalakaRude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF Rep</span><br>  Posts: 392<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/19/02 10:15:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dhbergen/malaka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: About VoF AOW attempt last week : </span><hr size=1> -so what i sat wont be VoF last word. but i think it is fair.<br>

As you can see NB killed oct 19, then AoW did not get killed untill nov 6, again by NB. That is almost 3 weeks of no AoW kill. Then TL killed on 17 nov, again 11 days in between, NB killed in tiem again, 21 nov. Then LoM tried on the 26th and AoW depopped on their fail, then LoM tried again on 5 dec and succeeded. Noone killed OR passed in between those 2 dates. Hello?? 2 times in a row! I have seen noone post here or heard of any guildrep talking to them about this. After that he got killed normally again untill we tried. After our attempt  we killed Statue because we were up for him and left Idol up for TL.<br>
<br>
This is where the *idol was up for over a week* came from, and also I KNOW by experience. Like Malaka said, we killed Vindi a lot and got jumped by him every other kill or so. That is why I posted HERE in THIS rep: ehmm guys?? noone killing AoW? See the link in another post that Malaka made.<br>
<br>
We have no problems at all to NOT attempt 2 times in a row and we WILL respect that and HAVE respected that.<br>

Thats thier right.<br>
<br>
Are you going to start tellin BOTs hey you left Vallon Zek up keel it please!<br>
<br>
At the time there were no other guilds who wanted on, POP had just came out, Attendance was a bit rough for some nights. I mean come on its none of anyones buisness what they did with thier mobs, wich at the time it was only thier mobs.<br>
<br>
As such you ask why should they care more now?<br>
Well pop is out, its been explored, and now the routine is back in. And AOW loot is still nice, I know alot of NB casters want ROD's after gettin 10000000 BOCs and Helms for thier warriors.<br>
<br>
My point?<br>
Dont preach to guilds on how they left thier mobs up for weeks when no one else is killin them then callin foul when they dont want the mobs that since nov6 has been killed regularly to be waisted when they do have them planned for the days.<br>
The Arguement &quot;well you guys didnt care before&quot; holds no weight, at the time they had no reason to care it was uncontested. <br>
VoF will get thier AOW, just like they got thier Tunare, its a simple fact.Patients though needs to be worked on , you are garunteed the ability to join, attempt and kill AOW, but you want it on your time table , not everyone elses, I think thats selfish.<br>
Maybe its selfish of the other 4 guilds who kill AOW to want to do him but 4&gt;1 and in the end VOF seems selfish to me gripeing about there inability to attempt AOW in a certain time frame that they want.<br>

I don't tell VoF what is important for them, I would appreciate the same courtesy.  I put us on autopass for every mob that isn't important for us.  On every single time we have been up for AoW, we have killed him.  Those times you cite for &quot;Idol being up for a week&quot;, were before BotS listed themselves as autopass, and so some slippage occured with them and Tindi.  NB has always killed AoW on our turn within 24 hours of his spawning short of once, and that once was long ago and was on a holiday weekend, when all guilds got some leniency on rotation mobs due to numbers.  Dain is important to us, AoW is important to us, Yelinak is important to us.  Until you see the little * next to our name on the rotation page, don't EVER tell me a mob isn't important to us.  It is not your place, period.<br>
<br>
And as I said before, you can have all the confidence you want, and cry about no mod rods, no necros - well let me clue you in a bit, AoW has 200k more hp than Idol, so there is a big difference, and new mod rods will only work 1-2 times in that fight and necros can't mindwrack AoW as he has no mana.  Until you kill AoW, you don't get the benefits of a rotation, because until you prove you can kill him, there is only one reasonable, logical conclusion - that you will fail, and waste loot that could be used by the current AoW rotation guilds.  There is no reason guilds already on rotation should be punished by having to wait for you to try every other AoW.<br>
<br>
I will not support every other AoW, as it is unfair to the guilds on rotation, and due to a very real linkage between Statue and AoW (namely, show me one guild on ANY server anywhere that killed AoW before Statue was killed - can't happen), any &quot;race&quot; is a farce. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>

As I've said multiple times now, the issue from VoF has NOT been the fact that he was left up whenever.  The mentioning of that fact doesn't help this discussion, and it should just be dropped.  The issue for us has been the fact of the apparent double standard.  You need to just try to think how it looked to us...we see a guild try AoW twice within a week, killing on the second try, and no bitching happened because of it...then you have us WANTING to try twice within a week (and probably a good chance of killing on the second try as well), but then stopped in our tracks being told it isn't right to do.  I really don't know why VoF was watched so much closer concerning AoW, but we were.<br>
<br>
As for what mobs are important to NB, only Karadin can decide that.  If anyone thinks a mob isn't important to NB, then they should just talk to Karadin, and I'm sure he'll be willing to discuss whether they are willing to pass or if they insist on killing this round.<br>
<br>
I would support waiting at least 2 spawns in between attempts.  We really need to decide if that's fair though, because some people seem to think 1 spawn wait is enough, and some seem to think waiting 2 spawns isn't long enough.  I'd really like to see some kind of consensus from the reps on what rule is best.  VoF will support the two in between rule if others do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 727<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/20/02 2:39:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=235.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: About VoF AOW attempt last week : </span><hr size=1> As stated by Fere FK supports no back to back attempts, thus a 1 spawn wait to attempt rotation again after failure.<br>

MY name is Levlenna and /or Kenau. YOUR members name is Mianiel.<br>

Yout told me not to talk to anyone about guildmatters but Karadin or Milambus.<br>
If you want to discuss things about VoF you will have to talk to Levlenna/Kenau or Bogarthamule. If we are not on you can also talk to Malystryx but he is not as moderate as we are.<br>
Malaka is NOT a guildrep. although she does know a lot.<br>

We DO agree on the: *do not try back to back pops of AoW and other mobs LIKE AoW that will despawn if you fail*-rule.<br>

I maybe made a mistake by telling you had no interest on AOW, it was just an assumption as we saw idol up for more than 1 week without anyone killing. you prolly had your reasons, and i am sorry to say you had no interest in him.<br>
