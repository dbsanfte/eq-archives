<br>
I just have a question.  <br>
<br>
Champions of Norrath is currently second in line for Severlious on the rotation behind LoM.  We've been second in line for Severlious for several spawns now ...because LoM keeps 'passing' to allow other guilds the chance to be placed on the Rot.  This is NOT IN ANY WAY A FLAME to LoM!  I commend them on allowing the younger guilds their chances.<br>
<br>
However ...something seems to be wrong with the rule as I understand it.  LoM 'passes' their rotation to a younger guild, yet doesn't lose their place in line, correct?  This means that LoM can pretty much 'pass' their rot forever?  ...effectively keeping those guilds who are on the rot their fair chance?  As near as I can see, LoM will always be 'next on the rot'...<br>
<br>
In all fairness, we have posted on the LoM guild forums prior to the 11/30 spawn asking if we could push ahead of LoM on the rotation, since they seem to be passing anyways, but were told that they would be 'taking Severlious down as soons as they see him up' ...and then they passed again.<br>
<br>
I'm new to the inner workings of the server guild relationships and this board, so if you want to flame, flame away ...but I do respect the policies here.  I do not have now, nor ever have held any ill will towards LoM.  I just wanted to clarify the rotation rule for my own quest for knowledge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dovelyngoldenheart>Dovelyn Goldenheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 653<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/2/02 3:15:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=887.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Severlious Rot</span><hr size=1> Sounds like they're not 'passing', but rather, letting another guild have a shot getting on the rot.

I commend LoM for allowing younger guilds their chance, but multiple allowances negates the purpose of the rot (that being that no one guild/entity etc. can dictate who gets what spawns when). <br>
<br>
If one guild has the turn and can allow unlimited other guilds chances and take it when they want, then in all practicality, they control the spwan for the whole server.<br>
<br>
This is something that perhaps should be discussed in rep forums, that a guild is only allowed to offer 2 other guilds &quot;in on&quot; their turn. <br>

We are trying to watch for him as best we can.  Sev the past 2 spawns has spawned 2 and 1 day earlier then the projected time on the Calendar.  We do check before those days though as well.  I often take my roomate's druid but have not found him.<br>

This particular mob is the worst on the rot - it's an epic bottleneck and there are now 23 guilds on rotation.  By not aggressively pursuing their turn on Severlious, a guild causes the guilds behind them to wait indefinitely.  How is it that on successive turns on rotation, LoM has let three guilds beat them to Severlious?  It sounds like a matter of priority over.  We all know that there is a random element to spawn times for these mobs swinging to both early and late.  This particular mob is now, for all intents and purposes, a twice a year shot for guilds.  SOE/VI has ignored the mountains of feedback concerning this ever-increasing bottleneck.  It comes down to the player community to excercise some level of responsibility.<br>
<br>
I agree with the two chance and pass suggestion.  It will promote the type of aggressiveness that a guild on rotation *should* have while still leaving room for situations that make it impossible to take turns on rot.<br>

<br>
What has LoM done wrong?  They were asked once for a chance at Sev, and they allowed it, because they did not have the force on at the time, and it was very nice of them to let that guild have a shot to get on the rotation.  The next two times, Sev spawned 1-2 days earlier than he was supposed to.<br>

I would think that after you (tupic) posted on lom's board asking them to pass so you can get your epic that you have been waiting forever for, and getting a response.. that you would not need to post about it again, here. /shrug.<br>

<br>
Just to confirm what Ghalid reported about this most recent spawn.  EvD did not &quot;prearrange&quot; with LoM to take Sev down and LoM did not formally &quot;pass&quot; to Evolutia Draconis.  Our guild spies found Severilous up a day early at an extremely early hour on Saturday morning (around 7:30 AM Pacific) -- most LoM were not even online at the time from what my /who's could discern.  Yet since we were scheduled to be up in Sky starting at 9:00 AM, a killing force of our members *was* online.  We decided we simply couldn't pass up the rare-for-us opportunity.  <br>
<br>
I know for a fact that LoM was intending to take Sev on their turn (and surmise that they probably would *not* have agreed to wait), because on Saturday night, an LoM member who is close friends with my husband but had not yet heard that EvD had taken Severilious was jumping up and down with chat excitement over the fact that LoM was finally again up for Sev the next day and with luck the green meanie would finally drop a warrior scale for him.  Imagine his surprise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Given that, I simply cannot conclude that LoM was not &quot;vigilent&quot; or &quot;dropped the ball&quot; on this particular turn.  Obviously I know nothing about the others but I would hate to have a situation where LoM or any other guild in their situation gets fussed at solely because they did not immediately buffalo over us with whatever forces they had online (not many, believe me -- I was checking, much as I love you, LoM &lt;giggle&gt;) solely because they heard that EvD had found Sev up and was mobilizing, just to avoid a claim that they were &quot;passing too much&quot; without &quot;regard&quot; for the guilds coming behind them.  In the end the vigilence to kill the mob before its scheduled spawn time should not have to rest *too* much with those already on rotation - after all they have proven themselves and rightfully have earned the right to the &quot;24 hour leisure&quot; that the rotation creates. The vigilence fairly rests with guilds like mine who are just now &quot;up and coming&quot;, for us to seize unexpected opportunities like the one we seized on Saturday unless we do pre-arrange something with the rotation guild (BTW I like the idea of having a maximum limit of 1 or 2 formal &quot;arrangements&quot; per turn).  After all, EvD might have failed at Sev or LoM might have spotted him first.  In that event, this entire thread would have been moot.<br>
<br>
I empathize with the frustration of guilds who suddenly find themselves &quot;bumped&quot; because someone took advantage of an unexpected spawn timer shift on the turn of the guild before them.  But I'm not sure what you can do about that, other than to eliminate the rotation altogether or have a requirement that guilds start camping their anticipated spawns days earlier than scheduled.  If that happens, it would guarantee that &quot;up and coming guilds&quot; would never have a shot, and probably guarantee that some guilds who are not 24-7 guilds would be tossed from the rotation because they simply do not have the membership for that type of hypervigilence.  While that's convenient definitely -- nobody likes to wait, after all -- it seems to defeat the spirit of the rotations to begin with.<br>
<br>
Since I didn't run the above by my guild first, all the above is just Daia and not EvD. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigorre>Rigorre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/2/02 5:35:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=887.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Severilous Rot(ation)</span><hr size=1> First of all, Aandiian, I'm not Tupic ...I'm Rigorre ...Rigorre Morrtisse, Necromancer, Champions of Norrath ...at your service.

Sure Aand, I asked if LoM was taking their turn or if not please pass.  Sure I find it frustrating that this particular guild has on two consecutive rotations allowed at least three other guilds to jump in (allowed due to kindness or getting beaten).  After Ghalid's response, I expected LoM to be ready to jump Sev.  Sure Sev spawned a day early (I think I already mentioned the random aspect of such mobs).  Why would someone then question vigilence when we see the same result of delay repeatedly?<br>
<br>
The question *is* vigilance as Daia mentioned.  EvD was vigilant enough to watch for their opportunity as were, what you seem to be claiming, five other guilds.  If mobX is not a priority, simply pass.  If mobX is a priority, take the mob down.  How hard is that?  <br>
<br>
This isn't the first post on Severlious frustration.  This mob is a bottleneck, arguably the worst now since Ragefire was addressed.  Hell, if I had the time I'd personally camp EJ night and day and call your members at home just like the old Ragefire camps to help you get your turn.  I'm sure their are other folks waiting just as impatiently and watching with forlorn expressions as they see the rotation for Sev growing and their wait increasing.  Perhaps the rotation cap proposal should be enacted - you may only belong to X number of rotations - would that help to prioritize?<br>
<br>
Being nice to the &quot;up and comers&quot; is all well and good, but it is fructifying at the expense of not being nice to those already on rotation waiting for their turn.<br>
<br>
Let me clarify &quot;allow&quot; and &quot;be nice&quot; - a guild on rotation has the &quot;right&quot; to a mobX as per the concept of the RTA.  Just because guild_not_yet_on_rot is gathering for a shot doesn't mean that by right, guild_on_rot can't come along and take down mobX - they are on the rot, it is their &quot;right&quot; to do so.  &quot;Allowing&quot; or &quot;being nice&quot; to guild_not_yet_on_rot as I use those terms, is *not* steamrollering that guild and letting them take a shot that they have been gathering for.  I think I recall LoM letting CoN have such a shot at Zlandicar (which we blew).

If Sev was taken of the rotation it probably wouldnt be an entire guild camping him that you would need to be concerned about.  I think he would pretty much become a new lodi (32k hp mobs have been severly trivilized by PoP).<br>
<br>
Just my view on the situation most higher end guilds that people would worry about farming would have bigger things to do than sev.<br>

<br>
This may not belong here in this thread, for that, I apologize and ask for leniency for a short while.  I will get up to speed quickly because these matters interest me.  <br>
<br>
Could someone please point me in the general direction of the 'rules', per say, for rotations?  I'd like to look at them in general, but I'm specifically interested in if there is some kind of 'clause' defining a guild's responsibility to their rotation if they are top of the list.  <br>
<br>
Seems like you would have to show somewhere that <br>
<br>
1) a guild must be 'actively' interested in the destruction of said mob (I doubt their presence on the rotation does this as there are many guilds on 'autopass') , <br>
2) that they would be making some effort to know of its presence when it pops (what, exactly, defines &quot;vigilence&quot;), and <br>
3) that they would have some kind of time frame from which to effect the killing of said rotation mob or 'passing' (either way, removing themselves from the top of the list).<br>
<br>
Not sure where the 'passing' comes in where another non_rotation guild is allowed, in what cases, and the overal restrictions.  Surely, the rules cannot be written to allow a guild to simply allow another guild to step in front of them for eternity?  Seems to me ...especially in this case ...that doing so would be the death of this system.  Eventually, you will have so many guilds on the rotation with literally no forward moment (no one is dropping off the list, nor are they progressing to the top for their turn ...all you are doing is adding to the end) causing a complete break down of the rotation itself.<br>
<br>
I'm probably wrong here in my thinking ...which is why I would like to read the rules.  IF I am right ...and that's a big IF, I acknowlege, then I do believe 2 things need to be done:<br>
<br>
1) find some means to remove guilds from the rotation, voluntarily hopefully, but involuntarily if necessary.  The restriction that any guild can only be on a certain number of rotations -maybe half? - would deserve a bit of consideration here.<br>
<br>
2) find some means to move the rotation along in a forward moving progression ...again, voluntarily hopefully, but involuntarily if necessary.  The suggestion in this thread was to adopt a &quot;2 strike rule&quot;.  Once you are on the top of the list, you have 2 spawns to take your turn (you can opt to pass on 1 spawn in leiu of a smaller guild if you choose) or forfeit your rotation.<br>
<br>
From a newcomer, these ideas seem fair to me ...fair for everyone ...and sometimes old processes that have worked before need new blood and solutions so that they continue to work for the future.  <br>
<br>
Might just be me, though.<br>

From Rotation Etiquette, the guild up for rotation (guild a) has 24 hours from time of spawn, to kill said mob.  If this guild choses to pass, they are to notify the next guild in line for the rotation (guild b), and guild b then has 24 hours from the time they were notified that guild a has decided to pass their turn for the spawn.<br>

<br>
Firstly, I would like to lend my voice to the chorus that has commended LoM for their fairness. By allowing others a shot, they are certainly not trying to control the rotation for the rest of the server. That may be an unfortunate side effect to generosity, but with a rotation as large as the Sev rotation, one must expect delays and speed bumps. I am certain that in upcoming weeks, the sev rotation will be talked about in great length, ironically having to do with it's great length. <br>
<br>
For the moment, however, I would like to examine a few suggestions coming out of this discussion. <br>
<br>
First, it is a very bad idea to suggest an involuntary removal from a rotation, on several levels. <br>
<br>
The rotations on arguably &quot;easy&quot; mobs like Sev or Trak, which also are our most congested rotations, are long waits on mobs that have very little to interest most guilds that can kill them... *except* one piece that a guild either needs *many* of, *OR* that is a rarer drop and requires multiple kills. <br>
<br>
We, of the RTA, should *never* forget, that we are a convention, and a powerless one when it comes to *actual* in game actions. I believe SoY said it best when there was issues with their entry to the Statue rotation: (I'm paraphrasing here, but it's approximately right). <br>
<br>
'If you want us to kill another one in a week, rather than 2 months, that's fine by us'. <br>
<br>
If we remove guilds from a rotation, where there are obviously already capable of killing the mob, we cannot enforceably keep them from killing that mob over, and over, and over. Hell, we really can't stop that from happening now, aside from dropping flame bombs on those who would violate the rotations. <br>
<br>
At no time can the RTA say &quot;you are not allowed to kill mob X anymore&quot;. It is a public game, and as much as it would clear up the rotation, it would also undermine the authority of the RTA's, as people said a big 'fuck you' to the restrictions on them. <br>
<br>
I know, personally, as a guild on the sev rotation, if we were removed, it wouldn't keep us out of the Emerald Jungle. If anything, we'd be there more often, to force our reinstatement. <br>
<br>
I would ask any guild who no longer needs trak or sev to leave the rotation *but* I would also argue that guilds short of the AoW rotation would not be able to field a warrior that is as effective as possible, without their epic hate proc. I *believe* the BoC is the first obtainable hate proc that is not the epic. Perhaps that club from the plane of innovation will fit into that category, but the point is really moot at this point: people want, and will fight to get, their epics. <br>
<br>
In any event, removal, in an involuntary way, will lead to a FFA mob, not a less cluttered rotation. It may work in theory, but people will always be the variable, and when I say that we would still hit sev repeatedly if off the rotation, it speaks to the amount that others would as well. (Keeping in mind that I am the biggest pussy about confrontation on this server.)<br>
<br>
I would suggest that we adopt a rule that does not discourage fairness, but that also keeps a rotation moving along quickly: <br>
<br>
Guilds may only allow one guild to go ahead of them per turn around the rotation; after that, if they are beaten to, or allow another guild to go ahead of them, that guild is inserted AFTER them in the rotation, in effect, forcing a pass. <br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Clan Bashemded up for Dozekar: We pass to United Necros as a courtesy, they win and get into the rotation *behind* us. <br>
<br>
The next week, we're up for dozekar again, and we pass to let Fallen Shadows kill Doze. They dead him as well, but this time, they go into the rotation after Clan Bashemded, making sure that SoY will get a go, or an opportunity to pass at their discretion in at least a semi-timely fashion. <br>
<br>
I think this will create a higher level of competition to race to, and kill faster, the rare spawns that we have on rotation, while also allowing a guild to still be generous without major penalty. <br>
<br>
This may *sound* harsh for a moment, but really, lets examine what it comes down to here:<br>
<br>
From the moment they allow another guild to kill a rotation mob, the guild up for that mob has between 3 days and 7 days to plan to be ready for that mob to pop. If, given between 72 and 168 hours to prepare for a mob pop, a guild still either cannot bring sufficent numbers or has better things to do with those numbers, then they are holding up the rotation in one way or another, and should be moved over to continue the timely addition of phat lewt to our server. <br>
<br>
This obviously is not a retroactive suggestion, nor is it an official word on the subject, just one man's suggestion. But I think to foster a more goal-oriented playstyle, there should be at least *some* degree of urgency to getting to a mob, and I think this suggestion will create that, while not fostering the hate and rush of a FFA environment. <br>
<br>
As it is, it just creates a situation in which a guild *knows* they are going to get a mob within a set amount of time after they are &quot;due&quot;. <br>
<br>
But again, this is not a slight against any guild, but something that would allow a rotation to continue moving ahead with some speed. <br>

I was in Valor in a group and get a tell from a person in CB telling me that sev was up and would like a shot at him. Well after checking the RTA boards I see he is up 2 days early. I was told CB could mobilize and have him dead in the hour. After checking the forces I had on at the time I told them to go for it. Congrats CB makes the RoT. A few days later once again I get a tell from an officer in X saying Sev is up, after checking RTA once again he is up a day early from the date he was due up. X had the forces on at the time once again I did not and made that decision to allow X to go for it, mind you they asked us they did not have to do that and went on and killed sev anyway and got on rot that way. I thank X and CB both for asking us before going on and killing Sev and the respect that was given to LoM for it. I'm sorry maybe it was LoM's fault for not "actively" scouting for Sev. We also have warriors needing their epic, I am one of them, however if I don't have the forces on at the time to call a raid to kill a mob I am NOT going to hold someone else back who has the forces on to attempt it. But its all about a respect thing to me, who am I to actually tell someone NO YOU CAN NOT ATTEMPT HE IS OURS, but I was asked and that means more to me. As far as ED goes on the Sev rot, Well once again expecting him to pop one day he popped early once again. My guild was happy it was going to be our first attempt at Tunare and we spent the whole day clearing PoG and killing Tunare, once Tunare is dead I get a tell from one of the LoM members telling me that Sev is dead at 8am that morning. No there was no one asking and yes I had planned for LoM to kill Sev the next day when he was sue to pop. I am sorry CoN that the rotation has been awhile for you, everyone wants their epic as do I and understand how you feel about it. I can promise you, as Ghalid has stated, we will send trackers out checking EJ on a regular basis. If anyone does see Sev or any of the rot mobs that we have up feel free to send me a tell. LoM will be killing Sev the next time he pops and I am sorry for all that has had to wait.......<br>
<br>
Rogg once again I do like your idea. Sev and Trak rots are way too clogged up atm and feel that may help out a lot of people....... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=209599"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://prodiac.sin.net/images/ray_sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

First let me emphasize, this is not a witch hunt to get LoM.  I don't see anyone 'pounding' anyone here.  This is a discussion on policy ...it should stay that way.  LoM has no reason to defend themselves in this matter.  I'm almost sorry I brought them into this as an example, but it's the only one I know about.  <br>
