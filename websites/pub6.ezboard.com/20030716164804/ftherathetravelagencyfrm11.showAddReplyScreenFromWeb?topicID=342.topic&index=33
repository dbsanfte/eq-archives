<br>
It really isn't that hard to keep track of who is up for what and when.  Any time I am close to being up for a rotation that my guild really benefits from, I always check what else the guild in front of us might be doing.  If guild_03 is in front of us for G/E as an example, I will look and see if they have anything else due on the same day...if they are due for G/E, HP, Blood, VT, Shei, NToV, Dain, and KT (obviously can be any combo of any rotations), then I will make sure to ask them which they plan to get to.  If they say they are skipping some and doing others, I will prep as needed.  If they say they will get to them all, I'd definitely watch their progress because it would be impossible to get all of that done in time (unless playing 24/7).  I think most others would watch that kind of thing in at least some way.<br>
<br>
My point there is that yes, others are usually paying attention to what a guild is doing, especially if they are up for several rots at once (Even if it's a simple &quot;Hey, did you guys get to mob_x tonight?&quot;).  So I think if a guild was doing a 2 day rot, other guilds would have a pretty good idea when they started, and be able to know when they should be out of the zone.  You're allowed to wait up to 24 hours to enter NToV after a patch because of the randomness of the spawns, and after that you are given 48 hours to kill the mobs.  So I guess I don't see the problem with killing mobs c, d, or q during that 48 hours as long as you STOP killing in NToV (VT for 3 days) once those 48 hours are up.  After all, you have 24 hours from spawn to kill regular rot mobs, and I could see 5+ single rot mobs killed in the same day...and if they all popped at the same time you still have every bit of that 24 hours to kill as many of them as you are up for.<br>
<br>
It looks to me like this rule sprung forth from the old Trak/VS convention, but I really don't think that should be set as the standard for multiple day rotations.  With Trak and VS it involved a non-rotation mob so those rotation guilds agreed that it would be easier to just have that convention than form a rotation on VS...that's the same thing as leaving many/most of the flag mobs today off rotation so that it is easier on all of those involved.  I guess my point is that just because a convention (a convention used on a non-rot mob as well) has been used on something in the past that it shouldn't necessarily be applied to other things in the future (especially when they have totally different circumstances).  It might have been the perfect solution for Trak and VS but that doesn't mean it's perfect for multiple day rotations.<br>
<br>
From what Karadin said in his first reply to this thread, it seems to me like NB was forced to pass on a different rotation on their first VT run, and that's when this multi-day rotation rule came into effect.  It was never in place before (I understand the logic came from the old convention) which is why a couple of NToV runs ago we finished clearing the first day of NToV, went and finished the day killing CT with our mage camped up in NToV still...then we CoHed up the next day to finish like we would have had we killed CT or not.  The NToV mobs wouldn't have died any faster because we were at the only safe place I know of to camp a mage in NToV (and there was no way we could have finished clearing that day) and CT died as well all in our given time frame.<br>
<br>
I guess I don't understand why NB would have had to pass on a mob during their VT run or we would have needed to pass CT that time.  Again, VoF wont be doing VT, and hardly cares much about NToV anymore, so I don't argue this because I think my guild is being held back...I just don't understand why the above situation wouldn't be acceptable.  If the logic came from sharing the content, then no one should ever be able to kill more than 1 rot mob per day.  Yes, back in Kunark there were only 2 raid mobs, so the convention made sense...but nowadays there is plenty to go around.  If the convention is applied to multi-day rots on the basis that it's not fair to get those mobs as well as your other mobs on the same day, then it should be applied to single mob rots as well.  Maybe it takes some guilds an entire night to kill one mob.  If so they used their rightful time and killed their mob.  Guilds that don't need the same time to kill that one mob shouldn't be held back from killing another mob though (and they aren't), and the same should be applied for multiple mob rotations.  The time limits were made what they were for a reason (so I'm sure they were well thought out).  Guilds that need all of the time should be given it, and guilds that don't need all of it should ALSO be given it (IE kill whatever they can, as long as they leave said zone within their time limit)<br>
<br>
Not trying to stir things up, I just don't see the need for the rule. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kelonybc>KelonYBC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadows of Yamabushi</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/22/03 10:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=342.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Some Curiosities about RTA Rules?</span><hr size=1> Thank you, Bogarthemule.  You so clearly expressed what I thought myself.   Once you enter a multi-day rotation (let's take NToV), you have 48 hours to kill everything there, without another guild able to enter.  The rules go even further and say no other guild may go in after you to are done there to &quot;clean up&quot;.  Every rotation that you managed to get on is giving you the right to kill that mob on your turn.  If you can do it within the 24 hour time frame for normal mobs after they spawn, then you have every right to do so, no matter what else you take.  You can kill half of NToV on day 1, port out, kill KT and Statue, and continue clearing NToV on day 2.  This is NOT unfair, you earned the right to kill all of those because you made it on rotation.  <br>
<br>
The rule in its present form is unnecessary.  As long as you can kill mobs within the time frame given (24 hours after knowing they are up), you have every right to do so, in whatever order you chose.  The only time you should pass on a mob is if doing another rotation prevents you from killing the mob within those 24 hours. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
<br>
The rule doesn't apply to single mobs, because no one stops mid-KT pull and runs off to whack Yelinak.  It just doesn't happen nor make sense.<br>
<br>
In VT, there really is no good place to stop, run out for rotation mobs, and then come right back to, and a little bit less so, N ToV (there is more than one safe spot for a COH mage, but they are spooky).  In VT,  you could stop after DXXT like you would on any first night of your VT clearing, and in N ToV, you usually would stop at Aary pit, even if you killed Vyemm or Fesh before stopping for the night.  In both cases, you get the protection of your mobs from other guilds running in and killing what you have left up.  Running out to kill other mobs, while holding those mobs &quot;hostage&quot; if you will, is hoarding.<br>
<br>
Another &quot;fear&quot;, especially with VT, is people might jump out to grab Cursed or Emp (the only mobs I can think of on rotation that might possibly be worth leaving VT for), and having a patch or server crash keep them from getting Aten, and then asking for an additional VT spot.  (Currently, if you clear day one, and there is a server down on day two before you get to Aten, you get another turn usually.)  So running out to whack Cursed, and then losing Aten, and insisting on a second full VT run is also quite a bit unfair.  You chose Cursed as being more important, and the server lost an Aten because of that choice.  This rule keeps that from happening.<br>
<br>
The rule didn't start when we passed mobs on our first VT, it started back in the N ToV days with SoT and BotS.  Before this rule, there was a lot of mob jumping when one guild would stop for the night, as people tried to grab whatever was left up.  The result, once SoT was fully on rotation (for a while, N ToV went dragon by dragon), this rule came into being, so that SoT (raided on euro time) and BotS (early EST) wouldn't have to worry about their mobs being taken over &quot;night&quot;.<br>
<br>
Since VT is much the same, the same rule applies.  NB has a mage logged out in several places in VT, so if this rule wasn't in place, we could easily wait till SOTE or FK stopped for the night, and run in and clear Named.  That wouldn't be very gentlemanly, and the rule makes sense.  However, much like the argument with teaming, it isn't very fair to the rest of the rotation guilds to grab a bunch of other mobs midraid while having those other mobs protected.<br>
<br>
It's really easy to deal with actually - if there is a mob up you really want (say Emp or Cursed), and it's before you start your VT run, you go grab them first, then head to VT.  If it's on the last day, finish VT and then go whack them.  If it spawns in the middle, and you take three days to clear VT, you probably won't be able to port out, kill the mob(s) and still clear VT in a timely manner anyway.  So this rule keeps mobs and multi-day rotations moving forward and keeps hoarding to a minimum.<br>
<br>
I completely agree that some guilds are capable of killing 8 mobs a night, and some take all night to kill 1, and both guilds should be protected under the system.  But let's remember one of the basics of the system - the faster mob X dies, the sooner he respawns for the next group.  Hoarding 6 named in VT while clearing 2-3 mobs outside is taking a tad bit advantage of the guild next up on rotation for VT who would gladly go in and clear those 6 Named (especially since one of those would be Aten).  It also risks that while hoarding those 6 VT Named, the server crashes as I pointed out above.  Basically, it comes down to priorities - which is more important, the named in VT or mob X, Y, or Z outside VT.  Make your choice if you won't have enough time to clear both, and pass the others.  If you can finish VT and the other mobs, more power to you.  The simple rule of thumb I use in choosing priorities: always choose your targets as if the server was going to crash imminently (which with SOE is always a possibility).<br>
<br>
So I would have to say that these factors lead me to continue to believe in and support the idea that if you leave a multi-day rotation spot, your rotation turn for those is done.  That way, the server is guaranteed, as much as is possible, that the best loot mobs will get killed as quickly as possible.  What I would say as a caveat, is that if you are able to kill a rotation mob with a small force, while STILL killing in VT or N ToV (think Trak or Statue), then I would have no problem with that.  Both rotations are moving forward, and you have not left VT or N ToV (in essence).  Obviously that applies to very few rotation mobs (i.e. you won't dispatch a Cursed or Emp force and still have numbers for VT).  The important deciding factor (for me) is, are you still actively killing in VT or N ToV? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kenaukamikaze>Kenau Kamikaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF - GL</span><br>  Posts: 354<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/22/03 12:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=342.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Some Curiosities about RTA Rules?</span><hr size=1> What Bogarthamule is referring to, is this situation, that indeed actually happened:<br>
We were up for CT, but since we are the only european guild, we will have to book fear ourselves and clear it and then kill CT in the same run. If we do not do this then there is no way we can kill CT, because when any USA guild finishes their turn in Fear, we are already sleeping. So we had fear booked for Monday since the weekends are always booked solid.<br>
Saturay before that our turn on NToV came up so we went in, cleared our way and then killed Eashen, Ikatiar, Aaryonar, Vyemm, Dragarn and Feshlak like we always do and were about to camp for the night, when we received a tell from the guild in Fear that they were done and that we could go in and kill CT.<br>
So a couple of us camped in NToV and went to sleep anyway, others camped and logged in other toons, and some simply ported out and we went and waxed CT. Thereby speeding up the CT rot by 2 days. Because now he died saturday evening, while otherwise he would not have died untill monday evening.<br>
Sunday we logged in again at our normal raidtime, CoH'd up the people who had left ToV to help kill CT and/or exp and we went on and cleared the rest of ToV.<br>
Would the server have crashed that night then we would not have been up for NToV again, because we already had killed Aaryonar and some of his friends, so nothing would have been lost. We would  NOT have been able to finish NToV that day, because we were about to camp already when that tell came.<br>
It just costed us half an hour extra to start the next day to CoH the people that had left. <br>
I do not think we did anything wrong or were *hoarding* mobs. <br>
We have also had it happen that, while we were clearing PoG to get to Tunare, a call for help came to kill Ragefire from a cleric who's guildies were not online yet. I guess  she did a /w all cleric and saw us in PoG. (This was before the spawnable RF obviously, when clerics sat for weeks on end in Skyfire to await *their* turn). We went out and helped her kill Ragefire, and then returned to our business in PoG. <br>
We actually left the zone, totally abandoned, and then came back to continue. I still don't think that this *should* have costed us our turn on Tunare, and it didn't.<br>

In your PoG example, Tunare is not a multi-day rotation.  And even were she, one could argue that you could have left 2-3 groups clearing, and sent 2-3 groups for Ragefire and been able to do both.  Especially in regards to the old Ragefire setup - which I would pass Tunare for to keep one of my clerics in line (assuming Ragefire wasn't one groupable).<br>
<br>
<br>
As for N ToV, any time a guild gets less than 2/3 of the spawn, and the zone crashes, they are within their &quot;rights&quot; to ask for another turn at N ToV.  The 2/3 number was created to keep guilds from leaving the triplets up (for lack of wanting their risk vs reward) and then claiming they &quot;lost&quot; mobs to a server down (which yes, happened).  However, Aaryonar isn't 2/3, and if that is all you got up to (Feshlak and Vyemm included), you would be well within your &quot;rights&quot; to ask for a second shot at N ToV if a server crash happened.<br>
<br>
Your specific CT example is a shade of grey to me.  You didn't stop N ToV to run out and go kill a mob and then rush back to N ToV.  You were done for the night, and those members left on, went to go take out a rotation mob.  You then went back in and finished your second day.  Having done N ToV and VT countless times, I know that no matter how much you might like people to camp in the room for a fast start the next day, someone (actually many someones) will want to go to the bazaar, xp, arena, whatever, so there is ALWAYS a need to COH for day 2.  What you did, as you point out, didn't take any time from N ToV than you already would have (you had finished for the night), and still kept CT rotation moving.  However, I would put CT closer to the side of Statue/Trak than I would Emp or Cursed in difficulty.<br>
<br>
What the rule is meant to do, is keep people from, mid-evening, TLing their whole force out of VT and running to kill Emp, Cursed, Tallon, etc (mobs that require significant numbers and are on rotation), and holding the VT mobs &quot;hostage&quot;.  If those other mobs are so important you would dump VT Named mid-raid to go grab, then you should let the next guild up have their shot at the VT named.  (N ToV could be substituted for VT in my above example).  You are risking a server crash eating Aten because these other mobs are so important. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kenaukamikaze>Kenau Kamikaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF - GL</span><br>  Posts: 355<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/23/03 6:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=342.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Some Curiosities about RTA Rules?</span><hr size=1> Oh yes, forgot Kreizen, yes we always kill him too and camp in his lair.
