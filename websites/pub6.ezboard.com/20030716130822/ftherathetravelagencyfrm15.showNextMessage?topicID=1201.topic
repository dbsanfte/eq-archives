<br>
Its no big deal. Its just the stupid factory flag. I could care less, and I never hunt there anyway. Just wanted to show everyone how quick this guy was at trying to get rid of me before doing what I know is his job.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/1.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Here i am. Just petitioning the fact that we didnt get our factory flag. Now, everyone knows the Gnome is bugged, no biggie, however, the point here is that a guide was rushed to our aid when Xanamech died in the wall, he pulled it out, then witnessed the gnome not giving the flag, told me to petition because flags can be given, even while you're offline.<br>
<br>
Incidently, I already knew that. I used to be the Guide Training Coordinator over on the Innoruuk server until I left for....(anyone wanna guess) conflict of interest. I wanted to help people and SoE didnt want me to. Moving on..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/2.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Its the guys SECOND fucking tell to me and hes already selling me on the infamous &quot;is there anything else I can do for you?&quot; For all intesive purposes, and because its true, keep in mind that already, this GM is done with me. (trust me, I know how it works). He gathered minimal information from me. in fact, he gathered none. The Gnome could've depopped. It didnt, but he doesnt know that. He never asked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/3.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Bug report it? Im not petitioning to do you a fucking service and tell you that your game is broken. I wanted my flag, and now, Im forced to look like a noob and argue with you over a measly FACTORY flag based solely on the principle that youre being a lazy asshat.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/4.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
I was too angry to remember that Kazann quit. Probably for the same reasons I did, which is why everyone liked him so much.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/5.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
here you see I petition again, knowing full well that this guy would not keep my petition in red (for those who dont know, petitions get escalated to different levels. Red being the highest, which it was already at) and sure enough, he doesnt, as I can petition again. He had deleted my petition before getting a &quot;No thanks, theres nothing else I need&quot;. Huge no-no in the program. Reason being is if they DO need something else, the higher ups like you to tack a NOTE to the existing petition saying their new problem so they dont have to wait thru the queue again.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/6.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Jessla trained me to be a guide, then insisted I be moved up to Mentor within 4 months, then a month later, made me TC on Innoruuk. This is shameless namedropping, and Im ashamed I even did it, but when you operate on anger, things slip out.<br>
<br>
However, I would just like to point out that at this point, the GM is handling my post similar to how my mom handles a brand new install of Microsoft Office. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wait...I cant find my document. I think I lost it. Okay, whats it called again?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/7.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
And of course, he says it again. YOu ever take apart that sentence? &quot;Is there nothing else I can do for you?&quot; Thats one word away from being &quot;Can I fucking go now?&quot; and that word is YET. &quot;Is there nothing else I can do for you yet? cuz im fucking tired of talking to you&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/8.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Okay, heres the thing. He really didnt gather any info, and I know firsthand that GMs can give flags. Ive seen it done. Ive taken a petition where someone needed it, and Deyvon checked it out, and flagged them. If it were a PoT flag, you can bet your ass I would've been flagged within minutes along with 50 guild members. Guides have a narrow window for whats important, and that window is generally only big enough to fit the high end content. Basically, since its not that hard to get the Factory flag, its less important than if 50 BOTS missed out on a Plane of Time flag. Only thing is, when the gnome is pretty much perma-broken, its fucking impossible to get the factory flag.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/9.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
This is where I pretty much give up. Because he's lying, and obviously he's stupid. He doesnt know that I know hes lying.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/10.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Thrown in for humor, and for anger.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/11.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
I really dont give a shit if your sorry. I didnt petition to get an apology either. At this point, i decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that SoE hired this guy on the basis that hes stupid, and never gave him permission to do that, or maybe he was just a Senior Guide taking out a red petition. (Which I was never told) So I ask him. He never answered.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/12.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
This is kind of funny. An Apprentice Guide took my petition at this point..you know..the one I had to put in because Svart deleted the one he checked out? YOu can bet your ass I'll use that email. GMs are still under the impression that email address goes to a snakebot or a trashcan. It doesnt, and Sony is really trying to boost their CS right now.<br>
<br>
Also, notice, in every tell, he wants to know if he can leave yet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/GM/13.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
and here it ends. He sends me another tell, with ONLY &quot;can I leave yet?&quot; and I tell him he's a jackass.<br>
<br>
Lets get one thing straight. Im not a guide-hater. In fact, Being in the program, I have every right to BE a guide-hater (and every reason as well) and im still not. There are many guides who are truly helpful, and god bless them, they will leave the program for the same reasons I did. <br>
<br>
Also, I understand that there is an enormous amount of stress being put on these people every day. Players do, in fact, get annoying. <br>
<br>
But when it leads you to the point where you can press a hotkey to your playerbase as a response, you need to call it a day, and come back refreshed. or quit. You're serving no purpose by not doing your job. I dont LIKE yelling at Guides and GMs. I hate it, in fact. I know what they go through. Its just this laziness that I find appalling and offensive. And I really thought Rathe's CS was cleaning itself up. I hope thats not gone now that Kazann is.<br>

<br>
Anyways, The Rathe, since Vaylin left, (with the exception of the short time we had Kazaan) been totally fucked in the Guide/GM department.  I swear they hand pick the total morons from the training process and send them over to us, where they last about 2 weeks, then we have none on for months.  <br>
<br>
I saw Vaylin the other day, I told him how missed he was, how we've been fucked since he left.  Some people thought he was a dick, but I sure would like to have him back being our GM today.  Nothing gets done around here to help us, it totally sucks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kluztzul>KluzTZul</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows- 3 years of FS!</span><br>  Posts: 638<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/26/03 6:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1262.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heh...</span><hr size=1> Little update:<br>

However, as you likely know having been in the Program, a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Guide</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> cannot give flags.  What he <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SHOULD </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->have done is gather the data, and go to chat or EQIM/ICQ to get a GM-Admin or GM-Lead Admin (the priviledge level required to flag people).<br>
<br>
Honestly, what he should have done was note the names of the people in the raid by joining the raid and dumping the raid roster to file, then appended that on a post to his board.<br>
<br>
Then again, Rathe Guides are a mixed bag.  Some are very good, quite helpful.  Most are clock-watching douchebags that just push green through the queue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pwnkoleto>pwnkoleto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/26/03 1:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1262.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heh...</span><hr size=1> how come you have a ragebringer as your mousepointer <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=desseray>desseray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/26/03 2:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1262.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heh...</span><hr size=1> Because the arrow is ugly?
