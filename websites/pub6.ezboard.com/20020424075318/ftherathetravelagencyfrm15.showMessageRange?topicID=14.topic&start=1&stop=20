All I have heard and read on this January 4th date is 98%, 60%, 89% of people on the RATHE.  Why don't you just say it like it is.  Everyone who is a posting entity has decided.  Because you are not listening to anyone else.  All you are doing is beating them down for stating their opinions.<br>

I know you are tired of hearing me but I am tired of all of this.  You DO NOT own the Rathe.  You DO NOT own the Planes.  You ARE NOT Verant.  So stop acting like it.<br>

<br>
All anyone is asking for is a posting date like everyone else.  Whether they have 40 or not.  Zanthor is at least trying by telling you he would like Jan. 4th.  Instead of thinking about it he was told it is FFA and there are guilds who are planning on starting problems.  Is this what your calender is for?  Bullies?<br>
<br>
Please think of what you are doing.  This could start a war that will never end.  All anyone wants is a fair shake.  I commend Zanthor for even telling you he wants to go on the 4th.<br>

But I still think you fail to see the issue. 3 months ago, the required numbers to post were like 18 or so. All people were waiting about 2 months to even get an open date any day of the week. Not only that but a lot of these posting entities were inviting each other thus using it as a front for more dates and the amount of waste was horrid. Its hard to swallow when you hear about 30 percent or 40 percent of a zone only being cleared and the rest left to sit and not be cleared.  Zanthor is not asking he is demanding per his own words. Eq is a social game of interaction, therefore dealing with people is required. But he cant have his cake and eat it too. As stated before compromise comes off both ends. And the indy day idea was being discussed. But I have yet to see what gives 19 people more rights that a grp of 100 (FOR for example) the number 40 was set due to pure numbers on the server. Once we get our server split Im sure it will be revised and lowered but we have to play with the cards we were dealt. I understand your anger and frustration but we offered him an inch and now he wants a mile. Im not worried about what is fair for him but is what is fair for the server itself. verant doesnt set any rules or guidelines (at least ones the players can swallow) so we are left to do it ourselves. No they dont endorse the calender. Yes they do support player made agreements. Its not perfect but its the best we can do for now. There is a saying &quot;you cant make everyone happy&quot; Its true, so all we can do is try to do the best we can with what we have.<br>
<br>
As far as numbers, there are over 1200 planable people supporting calender(check links) and that is an under estimate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unyca.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/12/00 5:59:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rockcitynews.com/art/artstill/valwarriorfem1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: HOLD ON</span><hr size=1> Jamany says:<br>

Zanthor was given every opportunity to tell the Calendar Admins (and only them) the names of the characters (not the RL names) of the 40 to make a Posting Entity.  We all want a day, so we gave our names.  He wants a day, but refuses to.<br>

<br>
Please explain how a non-posting entity like me supports the calendar and has been arguing against you.  Use both sides of the paper if necessary. For extra credit, show how I can bully anyone on this or any other server.<br>
<br>
I find your attitude towards this whole situation quite offensive, to be honest.  You belong to a guild that has posting rights, yet you claim to know what the 'little people' want.<br>
<br>
You don't know, and don't claim to speak for us.<br>
<br>
Zanthor doesn't know.  Yet he claims to speak for the independents as well.<br>
<br>
This calendar system is agreed to by people who are in KEG, CiW, RoS, MFH, TLA and loads of other big guilds (including yours).<br>
<br>
This calendar system is also supported by Rewena &amp; her guild, which is not a posting entity.<br>
<br>
This calendar system is supported by me and my guild, which is not a posting entity.<br>
<br>
Your attempt to draw the moral high ground is dubious at best, and duplicitous at worst.<br>
<br>
I ask again :  Please stop trying to claim you know what's best for the smaller guilds.  you don't have a clue.<br>
<br>
Maybe next time before you declare yourself champion of the little guy, you'll ask some of us what we think.  <br>
<br>
As for the actual content of your argument about the calendar, that has already been addressed by others to my satisfaction.<br>

You also are not grasping that there are bullies on both sides of the argument; it doesn't invalidate *or* validate anyone's position.  You, Zanthor, and Clept all claim to speak for hordes of the &quot;little guys&quot;.  The only difference between your claims and the claims of the posting entities here is that the posting entities actually have numbers that can be totalled to back them up.  You don't.  Simple really.  <br>
<br>
If you want those numbers, it's up to you to poll the entire server as you have suggested, not up to the calendar admins or the posting entities.  I'd be interested to see how you accomplish that.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umortyeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MortyEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/12/00 1:03:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: HOLD ON</span><hr size=1> For the record...<br>

<br>
It simply requires a great deal of organization amoung the smaller guilds.  (Gee, seems like a reasonable test to me...if you are too disorganized to handle it, I serious think you will be too disorganized to handle a plane raid)<br>
<br>
Think about it.  You are a member of a guild of 12 planeables who want to go to the planes...there are quite a few smaller groups of 6-12 wanting to go as well.<br>
<br>
You ally with the other guilds to get a posting date.  Then you take turns with who actually is in the plane on that posting date...Or you all go and die together trying to break the plane, and call in a BB guild to get yer phat lewt.<br>
<br>
This plan requires trust in your fellow guilds/allies, as well as a lot of organization....both of which are required to do a plane effectively.<br>
<br>
However since this is indeed a multi-player game, those of you who have solo'd to 50+ and not made many friends will in fact have a lot harder time at this, especially when the &quot;mega-guilds&quot; suck up almost anyone who is proficient at the game, and not a social outcast. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzanthor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zanthor</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/12/00 7:02:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/45/1255445.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: indie raids...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Yes, it involves organizing twice the number of people required for the job.<br>

Any arbitrary number is unacceptable.<br>

I'm sorry it's come to this, but it was the &quot;calandar&quot;'s choice, not mine.  I tried working within the system, and for it I get insulted, flamed, slammed, etc.  I post that I'd like to ask the others for ONE day, the first day I've asked for in the planes in nearly 2 years of play.<br>
<br>
I tried asking, and I'll play by Verants rules if thats what people want.  The PNP has an insane manner of solving this, but they DO have a manner of solving it, which is fair, almost.  At least it's a better solution than not being &quot;Allowed&quot; to go.<br>

For ever action there is a reaction, Have you even considered this and what you might be incurring to YOU and your guild? This is not a threat or anything in that way but we are a community and you are CHOOSING not to be a part of it not that you cant YOU are choosing not to be. YOU have the means to join this community yet YOU refuse to do so. The system that is in place is about as fair as anyone can get to at this point without a server split why ohh why can you not see this?<br>

You are the one making this a pain in ass for everyone not us you. Email your guild members names to the admins. Im sure you would have a password in about a day.<br>

(I AM NO LONGER GUILDED).  Not that that is any of your business but I think for this argument you should be aware of that.<br>
<br>
Second, I was simply making a statement that if you intend to NOT put up an indy day immediately, and NOT going to let others post without 40+ names, then you ARE going to start people like Zanthor into going anyway and claiming PnP.  That will start arguements over you posting raid as well as start problems in the planes yet again.<br>
<br>
Third, to MortyEQ, Are you denying that Bots interferred in a posted raid and bullied people.  Alkiron was sent there by me to keep an eye on my guild because of things I heard from certain Bots people.  The train was not the only thing they were disbanded for.  They broke your calender rules and are still able to post.  Where are these &quot;police&quot;  you keep talking about?  They sure weren't there.  They should have had all the toons involved deleted.<br>
<br>
As far as the math goes, I could care less about your so called 98%.  It is rubbish.  If 98% of the server voted on this than I think you need a math lesson.  Because I have talked to a lot of people who became planeable within the last 2 months and they never got a vote.  Also, a lot of 50+ never got votes.  You are stretching what you want to get what you want.<br>
<br>
Now, let's get back to my original post:<br>
<br>
Zanthor wanted Jan. 4th for a raid.  There were NO posting entities on that day posted.  Yet, he was denied, flamed, and argued with over his &quot;right&quot; to have a raid.  <br>
<br>
Right is not something you people can give or take away.  It is up to Verant to do this not You or your board.  It is my RIGHT to go to whatever zone and plane I chose.  If I die it is on me.  Not you and not anyone else.<br>
<br>
You speak of unintentional trains.  Hate to break it to you people but they happen in every zone and people die.  And in some it is hard to get there corpse.  And people often have to have others go and get it.<br>
<br>
You speak of retribution if someone goes up there without a date.  Then turn around and say it isn't a threat.  What else would it be.<br>
<br>
And as I stated before although now I know you don't hear me, I speak for myself and my other toons as well as my husband and his other toons.  No one else.  Some of my toons are not associated with ANY guilds.  Because occasionally I like to solo and be left alone so I play those.  As to the amount of friends I have, you have no idea.  I have a lot of high level friends.  But although I have been asked to go on raids because of your unfair system, I have declined.  I will go when I chose and when I want.  Not when you deem it ok for me to go.<br>

What the heck are you smoking? Give me some.<br>
Zanthor was flamed by a few, and his claim was debated by several people. Of course Zanthor feels he is being left out of the loop (even though this calendar debate was on almost every fan site and whineplay), and getting the wrong end of the stick.<br>
<br>
[bold]Right[/bold] is something the calendar can give or take away in the following context. This is where you don't seem to clue in. If you want to use the calendar in order to post for raids, follow the rules. Simple enough. If you want to go on raids whenever, then do it. But don't try to use the calendar for them.<br>
<br>
Of course if you pop in on a date that is on the calendar and disrupt whoever is there, well expect [bold]retribution[/bold] (that's a good word) from the community.<br>

This is deffinetly not a coherent thought.. hmm<br>
Let's twist some words around shall we..<br>
BoTs zones into Fear to assist Rogfear and troupe (don't know the exact details about the exchange), an unintentional train occurs and Alki disbands the guild.<br>
<br>
Now using your &quot;brain fart&quot; what BoTs did was unintentional, since unintentional trains happen in every zone, so should they have been disbanded? No.<br>

This is a real kicker, and will get you ignored rather quickly at most social gatherings. It has already been asked of you to come up with a fair and equitable solution. Can you? No? I thought not.<br>

As EQ has demonstrated so well, a great number of people are jerks, and will act like jerks regardless of which side of an argument they fall on.  Let's face the reality of the situation; 1200+ high level people have compromised on the calendar and they fall across a wide spectrum of behavior.  What should you, Zanthor, or whoever breaks the gentlemen's agreement of the calendar reasonably expect to see happen if you mess around with that agreement?  Well, for starters, most of the people who support the calendar will be turning a wary eye your way due to your own selfishness when you show up anywhere they are playing.  They will talk about you in group, spreading your name to anyone in those groups that didn't know you already.  Many of those will shun you outright and refuse to assist you to various degrees.  Some will ignore you outright.  Some will berate you in /ooc and /shout, and will mess up their own reputations in the process by publicly arguing with you.  A very small minority will take actions directly against you, and most everyone will look unfavorably on them for doing so, as they look at you for taking actions against all 1200+ people who have reached this agreement.  <br>
<br>
That is not a threat.  That is observed consequences of what Zanthor is about to do to himself and his entire guild (whose reputation, I might add, has never been stellar), and what you support.    <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uscytheeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScytheEQ</A> at: 12/13/00 12:31:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unaelyablacktalons.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Naelya Black Talons</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/13/00 12:51:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Seems we have a Martyr-wannabe here.... *sighs heavily* I hate those....<br>
<br>
Jamany WAS part of a posting entity but still fought for the &quot;little guy&quot; and opposed the Rules even tho as a whole his guild accepted those same Rules... and benefitted from them. *looks a little baffled with this tactic* Is it just me or does this appear just a TAD hypocritical? His posting entity (and one would assume he as well by default) benefitted from these Rules but still he posts vehemently opposing the very Rules that allowed he and his friends to benefit.<br>
<br>
Jamany has been INVITED to attend Planes raids by those who are adhering to the Rules... but has &quot;declined&quot;... I would suppose its based on his &quot;morals&quot; here... and his desire to say &quot;See?!?... the Rules dont let ME go to the Planes!! They are UNFAIR!!!&quot; I suppose this is some sort of half-assed attempt to get us to change the rules to suit HIS desires by claiming he's being prevented from going to the Planes by &quot;showing&quot; us it isnt &quot;fair to EVERYONE&quot;.  *shrugs*<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Jamany... I hate to inform you of this... but your statemants have proven that in your case the Rules ARE working. You were part of an entity that followed procedure to get posting rights... by default you did as well by being in the same entity... that shows this part is working as intended. (You later quitting said entity is irrelevant since you make no statement as to WHY you left.... for all we know you were kicked out  *shrugs* ) Then you claim you've BEEN invited by others to attend the Planes... but you refused.... this is ALSO working as intended... whether you choose to accept the invite or not is irrelevant... the option was given to you. Refusing invitations then claiming the rules are unfair and prevent you from going to the Planes doesnt hold up to scrutiny.<br>
<br>
I know Jamany will continue to post... but as far as I'm concerned HIS specific issues are a closed matter. In both of his scenarios the Rules as they are currently worked FOR him... not AGAINST him... by his own statements he has shown us this.... and that was the intent of the Rules... and the reason they were so thoroughly debated prior to implementation. If anything he has PROVEN the Rules are working to the benefit of the &quot;little guy&quot; he claims to represent. <br>
<br>
Perhaps the Little Guys need a new spokesperson =)<br>

Several posts say that making an indy day is not able to be &quot;POLICED&quot;.  Check the posts.  You will find this statement made more than once.  You don't police it or punish those posting entities that break it.  So what are you talking about?<br>
<br>
As far as what I am smoking?  A gentlemans agreement or player made agreement is only good if between the two parties involved.  If Zanthor goes to planes he has no agreement to uphold because none was made.  If you or anyone else attempts to do anything other than rant and rave, you can follow other guilds who have been disbanded for these acts.<br>

This is not a &quot;threat&quot; either.  But a verant noted fact!<br>

Let's make it really ugly so the server split is forced because we can't get along.<br>
<br>
Going to the  planes and essentially initiating a FFA is going to be almost comical,  I am sure you will not have benefitted anywhere near as much as if you had worked within the existing framework.<br>
<br>
I expect that everyone and their brother/sister who is planable will be there on Zanthor's FFA day.<br>
<br>
Of course you in your infinite wisdom have already taken this into account I am sure.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ohh and this part makes me laugh...<br>

&quot;you can follow other guilds who have been disbanded for these acts.&quot;<br>

Grundall, you're not getting it!<br>
<br>
Zanthor wants a raid that he can run with the minimum number of people that he picks, so his guild can run a raid solo.  Anybody going up there will be stepping on HIS toes, because HE RESERVED THE DATE.<br>
<br>
Of course, per zanthor, this calendar system is a joke because nobody can reserve a date and verant doesn't support it.<br>
<br>
Unless it's Zanthor reserving a date.<br>
<br>
I am still amused that someone like Zanthor or some of the other dissenters think that:<br>
<br>
* indy days 2x a month with a separate signup for guild raids and a 6-8 month wait between raids<br>
<br>
is a superior solution to<br>
<br>
* 2 guilds/groups of nonguilded people get together, get their numbers to 40, and make an agreement to swap fear/hate dates so that each guild gets to go to hate/fear every other month.<br>

I also noticed you made no attempt to refute anything I said Jamany... did I perhaps strike a chord with you that you didnt like? I've noticed the truth often does that to people... puts them offguard and all... *shrugs*<br>
<br>
What BotS did or did not do that day in Fear is not up for discussion. What IS relevant is the fact that Blades of Destiny has met all the requirements put forth to obtain a password for posting... my personal opinion is of them as a whole is irrelevant... they met the requirements... period. If BoD breaks the Rules they agreed to by obtaining a password then they will be dealt with accordingly... until they do I will treat them as any other valid posting entity.<br>
