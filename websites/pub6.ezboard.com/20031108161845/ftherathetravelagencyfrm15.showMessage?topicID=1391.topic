Sorry if it sounds like I'm whining, but I'm completely pissed off in general)<br>
<br>
I HAVE ABOUT FUCKING HAD IT WITH EVERSTRESS!!! I don't know what the hell it is, but I spend waaaaay too much time LFG in-game, to the point that I'm starting to wonder why I've invested so much money in the G-damn game in the first place!<br>
<br>
Zyrtryx is a lvl 43 High Elf Magician. And ever since I made it to lvl 40, finding a group is like a blind man searching for Jimmy Hoffa's corpse! I took a break from EQ for about a month, because I got tired of spending about 80% of my time LFG, 10% of the time working on tradeskills and cursing the entire time (I resort to doing tradeskills when I get fed up of LFG), and the other 10% actually grouping. <br>
<br>
The thing is, when I AM LFG, I either get people telling me to solo (even after I tell them plainly why I can't), cracks about me being a Magician, silence, or things that plainly tick me off. (I know two or three people who have pissed me off to the point that they are going to be up Shit Creek if they ever need corpse run gear or other summoned items and I'm the only Magician around....)<br>
<br>
I can't solo due to bad lag spikes that hit me at random. I always get a spike right after zoning, and it usually lasts around a minute or so, but the random spikes often last well over a minute, and sometimes close to a minute and a half. This makes soloing, and travelling through particular zones (DL, for one) very dangerous. The last three attempts at soloing ended in two deaths and a near-death (I was near the zone-line and made it out with 10% hit points left - Pet got wiped during one of the lag-spikes, or I would likely have won the fight), so I've given up on it.<br>
<br>
As for the break I took from EQ, I ended the break when I bought LDON this past Friday. (I got the retail version, had an alt claim the satchel) Friday night I spent time looking around and did the quest to get the Adventure Stone, but didn't try to find a group at all. I was mostly checking my alts' inventory, catching up on stuff I missed in guild chat, etc. Saturday and Sunday nights, I managed to get LDON groups. Unfortunately, both adventures (assassination missions) ended in failure. During the first adventure, one person went LD right after starting the adventure and never came back, and most of the party got wiped by a train (mobs resisted the Chanter's mezzes). Two of the people decided to quit rather than go back in. Second one, the party got the mob with 5 minutes to spare, but the 6 mobs in the room with him either resisted mezzing or broke free quickly, so it ended in almost a total party wipeout (I Gated out with less than 30% hit points left right after my pet got wiped - Only the Cleric was still alive, but with 6 mobs on her and me almost out of mana, well.....).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I've spent every night since Sunday unsuccessfully LFA\LFG. I've OOCed and advertised on the ldon channel, and even tried to form a group last night, but gave up when the Monk decided to go join some friends in KC. (There weren't any other decent tanks available) I decided not to log on tonight, because I'd probably go postal if I couldn't find a group. <br>
<br>
If this shit is going to continue, then I may just fucking QUIT!!!<br>
<br>
I should be AT LEAST lvl 60 by now, but its awful damn hard to lvl up when no one will group with you! <br>
<br>
I'm either going to:<br>
<br>
1. Quit EQ, throw the software in the trash so I'm not tempted to try again, then mentally give everyone who could group with me but won't the finger.<br>
<br>
2. Find someone willing to PL me for a few levels until I can actually group with people who care about DPS.<br>
<br>
3. Look for another guild that has a shitload of people in it who are around my level, are willing to group with me, and play around the same time I do. <br>
<br>
4. Abandon this character and just use him for tradeskills, level up my DE Necro (currently lvl 11), carry a lot of coffins for corpse summoning and try to solo as him, and ignore anyone who needs help. Ever. (Unless they're willing to pay for a corpse summoning) Because if I have to go that route, you can bet I'll be permanently pissed off. <br>
<br>
Anyone needs a lvl 43 Magician for a ldon mission and I'm on, give me a tell. I'll be in it for the adventure points and exp, not necessarily the loot (other than cash, that is - I'm saving to buy a horse, and I'm not even halfway there yet).<br>
<br>
(Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go load up Legends of Wrestling II on my PS2 and go beat the hell out of someone in a match with TKOs allowed in order to calm down.)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=halfbakedcleric>Halfbaked Cleric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 3:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1391.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   heh</span><hr size=1> The Rathe server is too old, everyone on the server except for a few people like you have 1 or multiple 65 toons for mains, and they just have alts that they twink to all hell and solo to 50+ then have easier times finding groups.

I hear people complaing about lfg for hours all the time...yet when I turn on the /lfg tool I see a cleric, warrior, shaman, and lots of DPS to choose from all LFG as well. Start sending tells and get people organized yourself. <br>
<br>
If you spend all your time with your LFG tag on and hope groups will come to you of corse it will take forever...but if you start shooting tells to everyone, you can get a semi decent pickup group together in 30 mins. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tejers>Tejers</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.homestarrunner.com/hsicons/sbdance.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 10:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1391.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   heh</span><hr size=1> 40s and 50s are a hard time for any Everquest player to find a group, IMO.

I'm kind of confused on why you can't solo, my husband has a young magician alt (ok, it's like level 24) and he solos with him all the time.

I agree with the other posts. Make your own group. When everyone is sitting around waiting for someone else to do it, nothing happens and 6 people log off because they can't find a group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emilsinclair>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GL-BoTS</span><br>  Posts: 495<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 11:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1391.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I can't solo due to bad lag spikes that hit me at random. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=repomankevarin>Repo Man Kevarin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LoM or die!!</span><br>  Posts: 525<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 11:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1391.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hallo-spass.de/avatar/avatar107.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heh</span><hr size=1> I can't solo because I am a rogue =( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nazrak69>Nazrak69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 1:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1391.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heh</span><hr size=1> I can't solo because the ladies won't leave me alone.<br>
<br>
WAKE UP AND DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE IT!!!!  <br>
<br>
Nothing personal but I'm sick of reading from people that bitch about being LFG for hours.  I hear it every damn day and usually they spend 5 of those 6 hours they are LFG being so annoying its no wonder they can't get a group. There are reasons I log on and get tells asking if I'm LFG before I can even check the guild motd.  I assure you its not my looks and most of the time I'm a grumpy bastard.  Here are some suggestions for you.  You can ignore this and go on feeling sorry for yourself and whining about it or actually try and do something to fix your problem.<br>
<br>
#1  Do exactly what you already said about changing guilds or joining a guild that is closer to what you are already.  You will meet people and make friends to group with as well as possibly going on some raids and experiencing another whole side of EQ.<br>
<br>
#2  Go to more than 1 zone when LFG/LFA.  Can't find a group in LGuk for 6 straight hours? get off your ass and go check Great Divide or Dreadlands or wherever people xp in the 40's these days.  Do a &quot;/who LFG&quot; everytime you zone into a zone besides just shouting that you are LFG and see if there are enough to start a group.  Do a &quot;/who all 40 50 Cleric&quot; if your group needs a cleric or whatever other class you are missing.  See if any of them are in PoK, PoTranq, Nexus and send them tells seeing if they are LFG besides just using the LFG tool.<br>
<br>
#3 Make some friends.  When you are in a group with a really good warrior tanking that you are getting along with add them to your friends list.  Do this enough and you'll soon have 30+ people on it.  When you log on check your friends list; if people are on send them tells asking if they need DPS or if someone leaves their group to please send you a tell.  This means while you are running around LFG you also have 4 or 5 groups that will contact you if a spot opens up.  Not only that but you know you aren't going to end up in a gimp group and you will strengthen those friendships, the game may take on more meaning than just getting new spells and loot upgrades.<br>
<br>
#4  Leave this server and start over at Stromm or somewhere else where the average level of mains isn't 63 and 90% of toons under 50 are rediculously twinked out.  You'll fit in better there.  If you play at odd hours consider joining a Euroserver where more people will be on during the times you play.<br>
<br>
#5  Stop being a jackass.  I don't know you and you may not even be one but if you are that hopeless at getting a group you may be getting a bad reputation.  Reputation is everything in EQ and yours may be fine but coming here and spouting off about how wronged you have been isn't going to help anything for sure.  When you are in a group pay attention, do your job, be fair and considerate and I promise you that people will notice and remember.  Keep that up and soon you will get tells from people that have added you to their friends list and want you to come join them for a LDoN adventure.<br>
<br>
Specifically for Zyrtryx I would say get a better connection.  If you are getting spikes so bad you can't solo contact your provider and have a tantrum like this with them, that might help.  Get DSL or a cable modem or see what other options are available.  Make sure your computer can handle EQ too or the lag might be your own fault.  Change your setting to turn off spell effects, turn of particle effects, use /showname 1, turn down your clip plane, turn off the new models, turn off sound if necessary, turn off emotes and about 10 other things you can do and atleast see if that helps with the lag at all.  I wouldn't want to group with someone that has minute long lagspikes either, especially in LDoN.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS.  5k pp says I get a response saying something similar to, &quot;I have tried all of that and it did no nothing.&quot;  Thats what happens 90% of the time and that just shows me that those people are not only pathetic but always will be.  Hopefully you aren't one of them becuase doing some of those things will only benefit you.<br>

All of my sympathy.  I played a beastlord until 56...and quite honestly, I couldn't get a group for love nor money.  I offered both.

<br>
1. I have Comcast High Speed Internet, which is a cable connection. The lag, I suspect, isn't due to my connection, because my zoning times have gotten noticably longer after a few EQ patches. I've adjusted my display settings, and they have had *some* effect on reducing lag, but not enough.<br>
<br>
2. I have tried to form groups. The other night, I was in the process of trying to form one, but it fell apart when the Monk decided to leave and go join some friends in KC. There were no other tanks on (or at least responding) at the time....<br>
<br>
3. The LFG tool is, in my experience, useless to me. When I look at it, everyone on is usually either high level or at least high enough to be hunting in planes, or low levels hunting in Paludal or one of the newbie zones, like Crushbone, EC or North Ro. I've only ever received one response while using the LFG tool, and to make matters worse, it came when I had to log off, or I would have definitely joined.<br>
<br>
4. I do generally check more than one zone when running around trying to find groups. Mainly GD and DL, but also a few others. I pretty much stay out of Dawnshroud most of the time for three reasons: 1. I've had almost no responses there since I was level 40. When you've had 2 groups out of about 30 trips to LFG in a zone, its not worth visiting. 2. I hunted in that zone for about 7 or 8 levels (soloing the shrooms over near the entrance to Sanctus Seru for about 3 of those levels - I'd always cast dmg shield on myself and my pet in case of a lag spike, and would bind right inside SS), taking up about 3 times the amount of time it would take for someone else to gain those levels there, so I'm sick of the place. 3. Wolves. `Nuff said. I've grouped in GD a few times, but the majority of the time I visit, the people there are either high levels probably doing faction work or soloing Druids in Wolf form. I grouped with a Chanter from my guild in DL (we'd travel together and join an existing group, or he'd run over to the zone-in and bring me to the group if he was already in it) a few times, but he has long passed me by in levels and no one I know is hunting there at the moment.<br>

<br>
As for the grouping situation, the only other people around my level besides the Monk were a Cleric, a Chanter and a Rogue. I was considering grouping with the Chanter and Monk, but the Rogue apparently logged before I could send him a tell and invite him. And since you can't do ldon with only 3 people....<br>
