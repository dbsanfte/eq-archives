Guilds give up their intentions to kill something when they get on rotation for the guaranteed shot of a kill every X amount of time. Its fine and dandy to make a rule only allowing one guild into the rot per turn, but a guild not on the rotation (even one on other rotations, who are thus supporting the rotation system) cannot be forced to not kill the mob. So now you have the same situation as before, but now the second guild doesn't get on the rotation, and can purposefully *not* get on the rotation so they can race the rot guild every time someone gets on the rot.<br>
<br>
It is definitely likely that more than one guild will get on sev rot per rotation over the next year+. A prudent guild with good timing could kill sev 2, 3, 4+ times more than any rot guild by simply waiting till someone enters the rot, and racing the guild up that the new rot guild inserted prior to.<br>

And no a guild cannot be forced to NOT kill a mob, they can't be forced Not too now.  If the guild works within the rotation guidelines, then there should be no problem.  Nobody is forced to be on the rotation, but its how this server chooses to keep things civil and gives other people chances for specific Mobs.  All this would be doing is limiting the number of New additions to rotations per each turn to keep it flowing.  This will prevent a guild from delaying their turn for a significant amount of time.<br>
Its like getting on the highway, you yield to the cars then merge in, and in most instances, each car will let one car from the on-ramp on at a time.  This slows traffic a little but it keeps flowing, as opposed to those cars that slam on their brakes to let 5-6 cars on, basically causing a traffic back-up.<br>
Other than that their is absolutely no difference than what is being done now. <p>Dembire Deadbones<br>

If people are aware of the rotation guidelines which seem most are, then how would it be a problem for someone to check with the guild on rotation, or RTA for status?  No one can stop anyone from just killing any mob they want, but people respect the guidelines set here by the Rathe community.  These guidelines are based on expectations that all will adhere to, to allow everyone to have the same opportunities within the game.  So I don't see how one more expectation is any different. <p>Dembire Deadbones<br>

<br>
One of the other suggestions was that guilds that can kill higher end mobs should drop out of the Sev Rot.<br>

Oh, and.. this is a discussion of how to allievate the situation, not necessarily to get the rules changed.<br>

There is nothing keeping one guild from doing whatever it pleases, ignoring the RTA rotations, killing stuff whenever they find it up ...and simply NOT getting put on rotation so that they can continue to kill stuff because they AREN'T on the rotation -they technically aren't doing anything wrong- thereby sliding in under the rules- while everyone else is waiting their turn in rotation.<br>

<br>
Dembire and I are saying the exact same thing...<br>
<br>
I think the RTA underestimates the respect given to it by the guilds of The Rathe.  We can sit here until pigs fly south for the winter coming up with individual 'what if' scenarios ...the bottom line is, most of those scenarios can exist today, and they don't.  People know the rules and they follow the rules, provided the rules are fair and equitable to everyone concerned.  Certainly you don't want to 'restrict content', but you have to be able to adapt when a rotation is getting freakishly huge like the Sev rotation.  The RTA adapted for the cleric epic, everyone followed that adaptation ...I see this as no different.<br>
<br>
Implementing a &quot;one new guild added to rotation per turn&quot; rule, leaving the second spawn of a turn to the rotation guild for a full 24 hours, seems to me to be a very fair compromise to all concerned.  One new guild gets added per turn (provided they can race the rotation guild to the spawn) and the rotation guild gets their 24 hour shot at the mob.  The rotation keeps rotating ...no one is being discriminated against because their guild only plays between 5:07pm - 5:38pm each night... <br>

<br>
 So far the RTA rules are based on everyone gets a fair shot (yes it is time consuming), and that a first time guild is not being denied the chance to experience content.  <br>
<br>
The RTA is about fairness and sharing, not telling up and coming guilds &quot;sorry we have ruled that you cannot try that&quot; <br>
<br>
If you want to fix the sev rotation do it from within.  Change the rules of the sev rotation, but once the RTA starts trying to impose itself beyond fairness it will start to be ignored.<br>

Do we not do that now with planes?  Do we not tell a guild without the required numbers that they cannot schedule a day without the 40+ planesable people?  There is no difference than what is being done now.  The RTA IS the community, It is my understanding that it is the Community that makes the decisions, not just a few people. <p>Dembire Deadbones<br>

There is nothing that can be done about that.<br>
<br>
The RTA isn't the mafia, no one can come and break your legs if you don't play ball. The rotations are initially set up by the guilds that can kill the mob (if there is no rotation, and one guild that kills the mob doesn't want there to be a rotation, there isn't nothing that can be done about it other than the other guilds killing the mob to go out of their way to keep other non-rotation contested mobs unavailable to the guild, as a sort of blackmail), not by the RTA. Those guilds set up the rotation for several reasons, including prevention of fighting over it, better control over their own scheduling, and sometimes even *gasp* a willingness to share =) The RTA just keeps track of everything in one place.<br>
<br>
By joining the RTA calendar or rotation you give up your &quot;right&quot; to race for mobs/planes, for the trade of of a guaranteed shot at the mob and being able to schedule the plane. The reason the rotations are respected is because:<br>
<br>
1) They are set up by those that can kill it at the time the rotation goes into effect, so at the onset, the larger guilds are respecting the rot because they created it<br>
<br>
2) Smaller guilds respect the rotation because it is to their benefit to do so, they *will* be able to get onto the rotation if they can prove they can kill the mob. After the first kill, the &quot;race&quot; aspect is pretty much taken off the map, and smaller guilds are allowed to develop without the &quot;race race race!&quot; component smaller guilds on other servers have to deal with to progress content-wise.<br>
<br>
3) Various rotations that might not otherwise be respected due to whatever reason (like length of rotation) are respected because by breaking the rotation you are pretty much done with all rotations and must now race everyone all the time for anything.<br>
<br>
If any guild got together and said, screw rotations, we are going FCFS. There is nothing that could be done about it other than people going out of their way to not help or screw over that guild or prevent them from ever seeing some mobs. You can't petition for a gm to come punish BotS if they went FCFS and kept emp dead so that NB could never get into VT. That's just the way it is (and what happens on other servers).<br>
<br>
We all agree to be civil because the rotations allow for fair equal access. We give up the right to monopolize content so that we don't have to worry about content we want being monopolize, as well as it just making planning easier, some things less stressful, etc. The moment you take away the right of any entity to get that fair access, that entity is free to kill that content as much as they want and there isn't anything to be done about it. Regardless if they are on other rotations or not.<br>
<br>
Sure, you could put in provisions into the rotation rules to force guilds to respect such a rule, and that by racing and killing a rotation mob where another guild has already beaten/been allowed a shot at mob X, they get kicked off of other rotations. However, that just opens the door to bad feelings because you go from just administering the rotation that is self-imposed to governing the rotations as an imposed system. You are saying to entities, &quot;No, you *cannot* kill mob X, even though you aren't on the rotation and so don't have a fair equal chance at the mob as of yet, even though you can kill the mob and are there in force when the mob spawns.&quot; It partially removes the incentive for a guild to respect rotations, guaranteed access to the rotation if and when they kill the mob.<br>

You are saying to entities, &quot;No, you *cannot* kill mob X, even though you aren't on the rotation and so don't have a fair equal chance at the mob as of yet, even though you can kill the mob and are there in force when the mob spawns.&quot; It partially removes the incentive for a guild to respect rotations, guaranteed access to the rotation if and when they kill the mob.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The thing is we already do this as a community.  We have a Calendar for the planes, and when a person who schedules that day, the rest of the guilds let them have it out of respect to the guidelines.  Again you do not have to abide by the RTA, but for this community we all do.  But aren't we saying that Guild A has the planes reserved, so guild B cannot enter the planes?  This is not a verant rule, this is by the community, and for the sake of fair game we abide by them.  <br>
So by limiting one guild to enter the rotation at a time, is really no different than allowing only one guild in the planes at a time, cause both are saying Sorry Guild X you have to wait til next time.<br>

<br>
You don't have to &quot;race&quot; anyone to get onto the Calendar, you only have to meet the Criteria.  You can then book a day that is unreserved.  Your reservation is then respected by the Rathe community.<br>

We all know that comparing a timed spawn like Sev with a scheduled zone like Fear\Hate\PoA is like comparing watermelons and tomatoes, but why can't the rotation be considered a 'reservation' system ...or, as proposed, some kind of hybrid system where the first spawn of a turn is a race (as it is now) and the second spawn per turn is a reservation?  This is exactly what is being proposed as a compromise.  It would let one guild into the rotation each turn (via the current race policy) and would let the rotation guilds get their shot in a timely manner (via the current 24 hour reservation policy like the Planes enjoy). <br>
<br>
Yes, it is possible, perhaps even likely that there will be more than one guild wanting in the rotation at any particular turn.  Yes, this new proposal would be like telling the second non-rotation guild, &quot;no, you can't kill him&quot; ...but, truly, how is that different than the planes are now?  How, exactly, would this not work?  Guilds, even those who are not on any other rotations know of and respect the reservation system of the Planes ...why is it a leap of faith to expect them to honor a 'reservation' of Sev?  <br>
<br>
The rotation itself is a schedule ...people should be able to look at it weeks in advance and determine an approximate time where they will need to be ready to drop Sev.  That's impossible now because any number of guilds can be put on the rotation at any given turn ...throwing the whole rotation literally an unlimited and unknown number of weeks behind.  <br>
