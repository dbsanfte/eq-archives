Now having said that..I didn't get mad at the person who pulled it...didn't even bother sending a tell,  why..uh cuz I figured out after crushbone, that zone lines=trains. Rez go back start over, rinse repeat...or find another camp spot.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is very nice to shout or ooc a warning if you are pulling a train...but sometimes, the person may not even be aware they have a train..they might even have been invised when they started in your direction. And in any case, if you set up your picnic on the freeway, don't be surprised when a truck spills your lemonade.<br>

Guess what, when people follow the zone lines, avoid the bats and pay attention to where they are going trains ARE avoidable. <br>
<br>
But when you have auto run on, typing away, picking your nose or whatever the hell it is people do.. you will train. <br>
<br>
It's really easy to follow the zone wall.. People should learn how to do this imo.. both invis and non invis classes. <br>
<br>
Having one or two see invis robie guys come disrupt a grp is alot easier to handle then having a karnors style train, on the first day of summer, heading towards them.<br>
<br>
Common curtesy.. shoot out a warning, make a hotkey, follow the zone wall.. <br>
<br>
Then, for the grp that is camping inside the dome/at the zone line, whatever. Be prepared that a train will come your way. Be ready to run when you see more then you can handle. <br>
<br>
If both sides did their part and learned to comprimise, then we wouldn't have people coming here to the flame boards *hopefully*.. <br>

Lastly, yes, camping at a zone line is just begging for a train to happen. We aren't going to train you on purpose but if you're in the way and don't move fast enough, all we can say is that we're sorry, and rez you. Which we did.<br>

You mean, the 2 cloaked guys, the 2 aliens behind them, the 2 aliens at akheva zone, then depending if you got left or right, One of these 4 arms guys+1 alien, or 2 of the 4 arms guys + 1 alien.<br>
<br>
That means 8 mobs each time, and 9 you went the wrong way. You better have a damn good chanter.<br>
<br>
Back to the topic, i always follow zone line and invis when I go to akheva. But when one of these cloaked guys see invis, i wont call train, be sure of it, i will be too busy running like hell to the zone line with 8 mobs on me, 3 of them possibly being SKs and HTing my ass. <p><center><b><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=156296">Malaka's Profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ughalidsoulsaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghalid Soulsaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/w/i/wilsonua/pstgif.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Legend of Marr</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/14/02 12:46:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=771.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Our Bad</span><hr size=1> It is unfortunate we did happen to train you.

<br>
But I guess times have changed. It used to be people were castigated for not having a &quot;Train to zone!&quot; button made. Used to be common to see those big capitalized letters saying &quot;TRAIN!!!&quot; occasionally followed by an &quot;/ooc oops, wrong button&quot;. We don't see that much anymore, probably because people are too lazy to make a button. Everyone trains occasionally in their EQ lives. Not everyone trains every damn time they move through a zone. Not everyone has their superiority stick shoved so far up their a$$ that they refuse to say, &quot;hey, my bad, I'm sorry&quot; when they f uck up.<br>
<br>
The whole issue of &quot;don't camp a zone line&quot; is bullsh it too. That's as stupid as someone telling a woman &quot;don't wear skimpy clothes or walk the street at night&quot; after she gets raped, ie. blaming the victim. Do you take a risk when you camp a zone line? Yes. Do people expect to have to deal with trains? Yes. Do people expect to have to deal with train after train from lazy people that can't make it anywhere without aggroing mobs and never use invis? They shouldn't have to.<br>
<br>
I admit I don't feel a lot of sympathy for someone camping a zoneline on the train tracks of common traffic. But the attitude that it's *their* fault and not yours when you run them over is crap, and shows a distinct lack of common courtesy and respect for your fellow players.<br>

<br>
In my experience, most groups that are set up near a zone line don't do anything when they hear the word TRAIN shouted or ooced. They instead wait there to see what is about to happen. There is nothing better than yelling train and then there still being people standing at the zone to get killed.<br>
<br>
Most people who are camped at a zone line do not zone over when you call the train, and sometimes get killed because of that. Most people don't zone away when they hear that a train is coming out of some morbid curiousity or something.<br>
<br>
It is really irrelevant whether or not people should have used invisi or followed the zone wall or whatever, as it is quite obvious that people will always continue to train zone lines. Setting up near a zone is neither safe nor sensible.<br>

It isn't hard at all to hit and really helps others. This applies everywhere, not just to ME. I've noticed that people rarely call trains, even in Seb these days. <br>
Put the train key in a separate hotkey bank if needed, IE: Hotkey bank 2. Then just hit control 2 or whatever the key combo is to switch to that group of hotkeys.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uspynaltapp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spynal Tapp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>OotBR - GL</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/15/02 12:45:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=771.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.the-blackrose.org/clipart/sig1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> LoL Dove <p><BR>

We've all trained, we all know the reasons why.<br>
<br>
The trouble arises when said trainer sees he's got a train on his ass somewhere in the middle of ME, picks up a few more, makes an educated guess that some un-lucky sod is parked at the akheva/UP/DSP zone, decides &quot;Well, that sucks for them.  How sad.&quot; doesn't bother to type &quot;/ooc train akheva&quot; and gets a few people needlessly killed.  Have a little common courtesy.  It goes a long way.  If typing 10 characters is too difficult for you, make a hotkey.<br>
<br>
But it has to be said there are bad places to set up an XP camp.  One of them is the first bridge in KC.  Another is the ssra zone in the grey.  Another one of them is the akheva zone in ME.  Feel free to set up a camp there, no one's stopping you.  But please keep in mind the risks, start with the basic assumption you'll get trained, and don't be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> disappointed when someone piles 10+ mobs on you that you flame them on the RTA.<br>
<br>
Still- my sympathies lie with those who get killed needlessly, not those who have so little respect for other players they won't type &quot;/ooc train&quot; when they know it will save other peoples' lives. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It is really irrelevant whether or not people should have used invisi or followed the zone wall or whatever, as it is quite obvious that people will always continue to train zone lines.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Im not saying that all trains are avoidable...they happen, but this fucker thinks that its the TRAINEES fault if they get trained, when in fact its attitudes like this that make EQ life  a bitch.<br>
<br>
You wanna train me...fine, Ill remember, and Ill amke DAMN sure others know about it. Im a REALLY small fish in a REALLY big pond, but there ARE big fish in this pond that DO give a shit about the little guy.<br>
<br>
I was very &quot;PC&quot; in the first thread on this subject, and I wont be anymore. If you (or your guild) is too damn lazy to to run zone walls or make sure you have invises, then *I* for one will never respect you OR your guild...remember, you represent your guild at ALL times, PERIOD. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen
