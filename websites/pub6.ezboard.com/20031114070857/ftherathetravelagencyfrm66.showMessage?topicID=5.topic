Thats pretty decent for your level, and ToV etc will help that even more. As an AC whore I found myself well over 1270ac unbuffed, but that was a waste of HP since the benefit of AC over 1200 isnt that much, so I dropped a few high AC items in favor of stamina/hp items (stamina being my weakest point as a human../grumble) I've netted quite a few extra HP at the expense of just a few AC in reality, which can be made up for in raid buffs. <br>
<br>
So to make that rambling incoherant response clearer, I'd shoot for HP/Sta items at this point, and quest armors will shoot up your ac along the way, but you're doing fine in the AC department as far as I can see.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Zutfen Valorblade<BR>

As you level, your defensive cap increases will raise your ac as well, so in your shoes, I'd be digging around for HP first, ac second. <br>
<br>
I used a belt of contention until I was level 59 (Thanks again to El'lar a year and a half ago, that sky raid was supurb), but I've fiddled with a couple of belts since then. <br>
<br>
If you want to keep belt haste, get yourself a RBG or RBB, better haste and the HP is considerably better. If you go back haste, get an abagoroths belt of defence to tide you over for a better hp/ac belt. But 20 ac and melee stats is nothing to scoff at. If you stay at belt haste, go with an ancient sea horse hide, ac 20 and 25 hp, not bad for the availability. <br>
<br>
Back haste, however, is what I am convinced is the way to go: look at a shroud of the dar brood (the zlandicar quest jobby) or a CoCW/CoF. CoF is obviously better for the HP. <br>
<br>
You could go the route of my guildmate Gorgar, and get a Cowl of Morality, for head haste, but since we can drop a champions crown on our head for 7 stam and 35 raw hp, that's the way I went. <br>
<br>
after 1136 ac, you can hit 1250 buffed with cleric/shaman/ranger buffs, so ac after 1136 is candy. HP are king. <br>
<br>
Mosquito leg earrings are godlike, pearly sarnak bauble is a very good substitute for one, 96 hp instead of 106, for 40k less, give or take. <br>
<br>
Upgrade those fingers! get the velium versions, the extra 20hp and 2 raw ac is worth it, long run. You may want to look at a shrouded medallion/dragon tooth choker/(tracking wolf collar? I think that's the name) depending on your price range for your neck item, Shrouded Medallions are Maidens eye drops, and fairly regular off the four armed guys.<br>
<br>
Speaking of range, try either an idol of the thorned (10 stam, 10 ac, 7 str, very nice) or a grodan's idol (15 ac, 25 hp, and something else for stats-it's no drop, butyou can get it with two level 50+ warriors and a shaman out of maiden's eye, the coataries drop them fairly often, 1 in 50 ish.)<br>
<br>
Cut out the 2hs though, what are we, paladins? Get thee a Swiftblade of Zek, or a fleshgrinder or two, or a shadowheart, or, or, or.. basically anything with +stamina and/or +raw hp for dual wielding. If you can add 175 hp in your weapons, that's just pure vanilla!<br>
<br>
Gloves: Skyshrine have 90hp raw, that's the winner for a while, I think for us warriors. Trade up the champions, when you can. <br>
<br>
Crystal spider eyes are 35 hp on the face, or an elesium death mask, I think they are called, is also a good face piece for hp.<br>
<br>
but yeah, whatever you do... earrings first man. Van Shir claw, or pearly sarnak, or anything up from 2 orc fangs. They will be big upgrade areas for you, because they are currently (along with the helm) probably the 3 weakest areas you have.<br>
<br>
For shoulders, if you get really ambitious, go for the crystalized acid pauldrons that drop in the ring of slime in cazic, they are very nice hp melee shoulders. <br>
<br>
You're pretty well set in terms of ac, especially with 11 levels left to go, but 2868 hp probably isn't where you wanna be right now. <br>
<br>
You *may* depending on your AA goals, want to start with Natural Durability instead of Combat Agility(I'm a com. agility warrior myself, but only cause my stamina is at like, 235 unbuffedish. If you go the route of ND, you may want to think about a couple of levels of stamina (for real) since at level 60, 1 stam = 6 hp. 10 points of stam for general aa and then, what, 10 more for PoP aa, be 120 hp, not including your ND additions. <br>
<br>
who knows? Anyway, you'll see a very nice hp jump by 60, I'd say, but there also is some gear for you to look at getting.<br>

HP/sta is the way to go, at least in the perspective of a guild warrior.  I think against larger mobs your AC means precisly dick, ever caught agro off of Statue?  I doubt any amount of AC in the world would have made a difference.  <br>
<br>
Rogg, you meantioned some items that I agree with, and others I don't (imagine that haha) like the upgrade of rings and earings are definite.  Mosqito legs (don't I wish) and Pearly Sarnak Baubles (alms....alms for the poor) are the way to go.  Of course I'm a poor ass level 56 warrior and can't afford either, so I went with Velium Bloodstone Earings, the only stat is 7sta, not much but sta=hps.  As far as shoulders go, the ones I'm shooting for are <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6989">everquest.allakhazam.com/...?item=6989</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Just need two more pieces for those (wish me luck on Master Yael).  And I've also come to the conclusion that back haste is the way to go.  I haven't gone there yet, as that again, I'm a poor ass wood elf; but I agree that's the way to go unless you can get your hands on some of those incredible NToV haste belts (which most of us can't).  If I had the cash I would go with CoF and a <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10440">everquest.allakhazam.com/...item=10440</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
And I'm not sure about the whole 1hs vs 2hs debate anymore.  I was MT in a UP group the other day, and decided for fun I was going to switch out to my Black Acrylia Halbred and see if I could hold agro.  I could, and I didn't parse for damage output but it seemed comparable( course that could be cause my 1hs weps suck ass).  Realize I had competition for agro, I had a 61 Ranger weilding Swifty in his offhand and a prenerfed LoSEE in his main, and a 59 Pally with his Epic in the combat as well.  This is leading me to believe that with the addition of the bonus damage all those months ago that taunt is equal between 1hs and 2hs.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just thought I would put my 2 cp in.  I just woke up and my medicine has gotten me high.<br>

I've been wanting a Pearly Sarnak Bauble and I know the whereabouts in Chardok where it drops.<br>
<br>
I also want a new helmet.  I am shooting for a Thurg or SS helm.  If I can't get either of those, I normally try to go to Umbral Planes to get the Helm of Raldukan.  My budget isn't very big.  I usually make slow cash by way of SolB hehe.<br>
<br>
As for the rings, which ones are you talking about exactly?  I've seen some nice rings, but a lot of them no longer drop, and the Coldain quest is kind of hard to get started on.  The Dragon Ring quest in the swamp looks kind of need neat.<br>
<br>
I will probally have to keep this haste I have for a while, unless something just drops into my hands.  Its really whichever haste item I get, I will probally keep it and upgrade accordingly.<br>
<br>
The face slots is something I want to upgrade as well.  I'm looking for something that I can get that I can acquire easily.  Because I can't buy any of my stuff to be honest.<br>
<br>
As for weapons go, I'm not too worried about them.  I think I will try to get a Windblade next.  Usually when I duel warrior my level who use 1hs I win.  So I want to stick to 2hs(plus I love the big crits and cripplings).<br>
<br>
The I may shoot for some more Underfoot armor to upgrade some of my stuff.  I actually use the dwarven smith in your guild, Ragrog(who rocks), and he has really good prices.  I will probally get the neck slot, and maybe the face slot from Ragrog next.  He has made 12 things for me, and never failed.<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd thank you for helping me with this, and responding to it.  Thanks. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=296342">Calhoon Jugganaut,<br>

Helm of Raldukan, I think is nice too, but something is nagging at me that says Champions is still better. <br>
<br>
And yeah, after you get a bauble out of chardok, do what I'm doing and take the long, annoying, hard road of chardok faction and drop a regal band of bathezid quest on your finger. 85 hp ring! BOOYA. <br>
<br>
Anyway, m0 suggestions. <br>
<br>
You're right about 2hs probably doing better in duels (you riposte for more, they riposte less often, etc etc.) If you're going pure damage, well, I dunno, couple good 1hs's I still think will own a 2hs, but /shrug whatever floats your boat. <br>

But 1HS will hold aggro much better, especially if you use proccing weapons.  Keep your 2HS skills up in case you are ever in a situation when you do not want aggro at all, but keep your DW skills up for when you are MT.<br>

I have always valued HP over AC even prior to ntov. As you can see by boards such as FoH and other uber's, they all try and brag about how high their highest warriors hp are. <br>
<br>
AC is very easy to obtain once you get to the right zones, hp just helps you in the fights that get you to those zones.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=miondalshar>MionDalShar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/21/03 7:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.virtuallandmedia.com/flags11/pirate2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HP or AC?</span><hr size=1> Personally I went the way of AC.. to my sheer disapointment.  If i could do things differently i would put points into sta and dex.  Now that I am working on AA i am dumping a buncha pouints into Natural Durability.. its good to know that things can be fixed at least a little.  Today my Hitopints..raid-buffed were 6123 and ac was 1367.  Not too shabby, but i think for a lvl 62 warrior my hitpoints should be a  TON more then that. We shall see.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/miondalshar/siggypoo.txt" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I'm at 7.4khp when raid buffed and still gotta get nd3 and pd3 though.  Then hopefully I'll be at 8k hp.<br>
<br>
I still need a few things, a mask, new bracers, and a new arm slot though.  Might go for some new booties too.  A helm wouldn't be bad either heh.  Anyways, just giving a small update. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm66.showPrevMessage?topicID=5.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm66.showNextMessage?topicID=5.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm66.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm66.emailToFriend?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm66.threadControl?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm66.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm66.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm71">The Book Shelf<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm68">Current World Events<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm69">Elemental Planes<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm66>Warrior</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
