Please don't be a moron and mess with this and get me any more requests for information and bannings.

Please listen to me on this one and find something else to waste your time on.<br>

[EDIT - Released this from sticky. Everyone got the message loud and clear... whether they agree with it or not is not for me to decide. I'm not sure if this is going to help or hurt AC or encourage more idiocy, but like always I'm just trying to help someone out. I've removed passwords to IB and Triad boards posted in here before, and I'll keep doing the same for AC, as well as removing material that's private that is posted here (most likely only pics). Don't know how else to handle this, I'm no lawyer, and I'm not looking up the laws for this. But I think it falls under the rules for this messageboard about private information that the owner wants off the boards, so, at least I'm not doing it for nothing. ~Bic] <p><CENTER>&nbsp;<TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000000" WIDTH=370>

1) n. the exclusive right of the author or creator of a literary or artistic property. As soon as a work is created and is in a tangible form the work automatically has federal copyright protection.<br>
<br>
The copyright trademark is only needed for stuff below.<br>
<br>
On any distributed and/or published work a notice should be affixed stating the word copyright, copy or ©, with the name of the creator and the date of copyright (which is the year of first publication). The notice should be on the title page or the page immediately following and for graphic arts on a clearly visible or accessible place. <br>
<br>
 Not subject to copyright are short phrases, titles, extemporaneous speeches or live unrecorded performances, common information, government publications, mere ideas, and seditious, obscene, libelous and fraudulent work. For any work created from 1978 to date, a copyright is good for the author's life, plus 50 years, with a few exceptions such as work &quot;for hire&quot; which is owned by the one commissioning the work for a period of 75 years from publication. <br>

<br>
Copyright is not that simple. AC does technically &quot;own&quot; the posts there, however there is a registration process they need to take up with the appropriate federal agencies before it can be enforced. I'm sure they haven't done this, as it costs money and takes some time. The reason people use publishers is that this sort of hassle is taken care of for you.<br>
<br>
If they haven't posted the equivalent of a legally binding one-click agreement on their site that forces you to agree NOT to distribute their data (the kind you MUST accept in order to view the material) then there is absolutely nothing they can do legally. Copyright itself doesn't prevent copying, it is just a mechanism to insure that the author is the only party allowed to make a profit or take credit for the work.<br>
<br>
Cut/Pasting that information on a message board is not in any way costing them any money or taking away any credit from them. Nobody has clicked through on any license agreements either, so that's out. I'd also bet real money that whatever EZBoard-like system they are using has a superceding copyright agreement on their contract for site useage that transfers copyright to the company that owns/developed the boards. In that case, AC must contact them for enforcement, and there is no way in hell that any company is going to pay money out to lawyers over something this ridiculous. So, that's out.<br>
<br>
They have no real legal recourse. Posting messages saying not to reproduce content don't do it, it takes a MUST click agreement. All others have not held up in court. Heck, even one click agreements are on somewhat shaky ground in court, but that's another issue.<br>
<br>
Bottom line Bic, whoever threatened you is blowing smoke up your ass. IANAL, but for this, you don't need to be. I've a friend IRL who's just finished his masters in IP Law at Franklin Pierce... we have the most amazing conversations, since he's a die hard republican and I'm libertarian... he likes Microsoft and I like linux... closed vs open on every issue. I can't for the life of me figure out how in hell we became friends. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've had this exact conversation with him many times, there isn't a doubt in my mind about this.<br>
<br>
It's up to you Bic, you are the mod, you decide if we want to honor their &quot;request&quot; to remove information. If they asked me nice, I'd think about it, if they asked me mean, I'd fsck them hardcore... but that's just me.<br>
<br>
Now, back to business... /flame on<br>
<br>
Fscking AC shitbags know less about the law then they do about the game (who knew THAT was possible?!). They can't send any real flamers here, and they are far to poosae to take the heat, so they hassle our mods with bullshit legal threats. They can't even handle jsut WALKING AWAY from the FnR. Now they've got to try and &quot;beat the system&quot;. What a load of shi.t. What's wrong, AC? The blood getting in your eyes? Your ears ringing? Run crying home to mommy? If you had any damned quality control in your playerbase maybe you wouldn't have 10 spies from every guild in your own and on your message boards. Don't come here whining to Bic to fix your problems when you could fix them yourselves if you had an ounce of brainpower, class, and skill. Get the f.uck off our server, honestly, your whole guild is an embarassment and a nuisance. Go over to Torvo, you'll fit right in with those fscking nimrods. <p>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>

For those defending the ability to post website content intended for a restricted audience ask yourself if you would like the same done to your own guild.

The stuff is all good and fun for the normal lurkers here but I'm sure the folks whose privacy got violated didn't appreciate it. I'm neutral to all this guild politicing and don't think this approach becoming a legal issue. Folks just need some common sense and courtesy cause I'm sure most guilds have their moles.

Sorry Lifey, that's technically obscene, so not covered.  It's also self libelous. It isn't a Short phrase, as I believe it meets the noun/verb requirement for a true sentence.  Still falls under the not subject to copyright part tho.<br>
<br>
On the plus side, Sig-Cow #2 could also 'Moo', as Sig-Cow#1 is obviously being seditious.  Plus I think that was in a government publication...<br>
