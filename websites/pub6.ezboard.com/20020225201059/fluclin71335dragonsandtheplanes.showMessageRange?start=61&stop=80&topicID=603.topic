Just like there are always kids in the playground who would like to share their marbles, and those who would rather horde them. Luclin just happens to be fortunate enough to be comprised of a population where the majority of us would rather work together and create a positive gaming environment for all as opposed to people solely out for themselves at the expense of others.<br>
<br>
Council of guilds is one means to that end.  These message boards and intra-game communication are other effective means.  Our Calendar is probably the biggest and most successful attempt to keep the server working together(and I have yet to see anyone provide a system that works better than our Calendar--unless you are an advocate of FFA, then you advocate no system at all).  Yes, everything has flaws.  Yes, things always need to be hammered out.  New situations arise (i.e. Zordak) where people have to create a different way to work things out.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, we are a better server due to the work of so many who care about keeping server unity, and I commend these individuals.  The majority of this server has chosen to work together.  No, you dont have to work with anyone or abide by any 'rules' other than those set forth by Verant.  What you do is always your choice...just remember choices always have consequences.<br>
<br>
As for the newbie guild comment...be careful who you call newbie.  Many of the guilds who post here date back to the days when my small guild, Endorean, existed.  I raided with many of these people.  Just because they may not have the numbers of Apex or the experience of LoS doesnt mean they are &quot;newbie guilds.&quot;  Additionally, with as long as EQ has been on the market, that level 6 warrior you saw in Ecommons yesterday probably has 3 or 4 level 50 plus characters spanned over various servers.  Level 6 warriors also become level 60 warrios, so the decisions being made now will effect these individuals down the road.  It really doesnt take very long to become planar capable.<br>
<br>
Im glad to see that there are still so many of us interested in keeping Luclin such a wonderful community to be a part of!<br>

This thread will suffice. Why not flame other people that didn't show and shared opinion here?<br>
<br>
The guilds i am calling 'newbie guilds' aren't necessarily newbies. In comparison to other guilds, they probly are. I'm sure alot of the lower level guilds don't know planes and alot of the other popular raid spots quite as well as Apex or LoS. Me calling guilds 'newbie guilds' is far from me trying to rag on any guild. <br>
<br>
Why must you flame me? I explained my position and you flame? There is NOTHING wrong with doing planes and such EXACTLY like exp camps. Not hard to do /who all's, see whats raided, then take your forces somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Again, IMO you guys are making it more complicated than it needs to be. Verant's rules work perfectly fine.<br>
<br>
If you want to flame, take it to the flames and rants board. Otherwise, STFU! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukaldan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaldan</A> at: 2/15/01 1:03:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukaldan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaldan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/15/01 1:06:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=603.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> All i'm really saying is...</span><hr size=1> All i'm really saying is...No need for the calendar.

Nothing has changed, except all my predictions came true and the Calender is being abused (albiet mildly) still to this day. =) sucks to say i told ya so. People still think Calender systems can/will work...the only reservation system that can work (trust me on this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It can't fail) is a rotation system, one goverened by a Council of Guilds, where<br>
<br>
PoF - Friday   PoF - Saturday  PoF- Sunday<br>
Guild A        Guild B         Guild C<br>
Guild B        Guild C         Guild A<br>
so and and so on, so forth and so forth...<br>
<br>
This system also inherently cuts out any multi raids, unless your multi raid has checked in with the Council, recieved its approval to raid, and call your merry band of multi's an alliance..<br>
<br>
This does become very tedious work, but really can't be exploited if done right. You break a rule - you lose a raid. <br>
<br>
For new guilds to join this Council, they will need to demonstrate that they have the power to ______ and ______<br>
<br>
I was a part of one such alliance on Karana, Alliance of Valiant Blades...Had maybe 5-6 near uber guilds..the total alliance had maybe 300 people total..was kinda fun.<br>
<br>
I don't remember all the rules/stipulations etc..but this is the basic gist of it.<br>
<br>
input/flames appreciated.<br>
<br>
Oh and btw - the message board this was all run on, was a restricted msg board, with acess to only guild officers/guild leaders. (A limit of 4 officers would be prudent.) Spots were allowed to be traded, etc, etc..(swapping slots directly, not trading a CoF for a shot at trak.)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately under this system gods were reserved in a similar manner, meaning we couldn't touch Cazic because it was Combine's turn next week, etc...prolly just change it to Cazic = he's up, you got lucky he's all yours.<br>

That idea is a good one.  However, and not flaming you, the CoG does not want to Dictate.  We just would like all to work together and follow guidelines that a majority of the server agrees upon.<br>

I like the idea though.  Seems it would be quite a bit of work.  I am also not trying to sound Condescending either.<br>

<br>
Whatever, I'm not gonna dwell on it, because it's not worth it.  Just keep in mind that with a population of 2000 or so people, an alarming percentage of whom are NOT &quot;newbies&quot;, FFA is just going to take the enjoyment out of the game for a whole lot of people.<br>
<br>
And Deris, if your definition of &quot;closed minded&quot; means &quot;doesn't agree with you&quot;, then I guess most people are closed minded.  Nobody's trying to dictate anything here, they're just trying to agree on some guidelines.<br>
<br>
It really burns my ass to see honest efforts rewarded with &quot;I told you so's&quot; and veiled insults.  At least they're trying to look out for the server as a whole, rather than that small percentage of players who have enormous amounts of time and in-game resources.<br>

I'm not sure how much you actually read, or if you just check to see if people are responding to you. Whatever, anyway, here you go:<br>
<br>
Hmmm... funny, I only see one person who has a problem with it. But just out of curiousity, if noone has to follow 'guidelines' that representatives from all large guilds except LOS (not flaming, you just weren't there! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  no biggy... come next time!) were there to help create and accept, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> then why follow the calendar either</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->? I mean, it's a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 'rule'</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that you should post your raid on the calendar, and it's a 'rule' not to have a raid during someone else's time. Makes me curious... the calendar has 2 main 'rules' as I see it. First, post the date and time of when you want to have your raid. Fairly simple, not hard. Second, don't post a raid at the same place at the same time as someone else, because that's their reserved time and place. That also seems simple and fair.<br>
<br>
What has followed is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 'guidelines'</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of how the calendar should be used above and beyond those simple 2 'rules'. Most of these 'guidelines' have been in place for some time now and were agreed upon, and noone had had too much of a problem with it, and some have deviated from it from time to time, but on a whole it's worked well and has been fair to all.<br>
<br>
Now, that the council of guild's has come back, everyone can come and have a chance to rework and tweak the 'guidelines' so that they are as fair as possible to every individual and guild on the server. Quite frankly, I think pushing for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> fairness and an equal chance is a good thing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
The problem is that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> this stuff is difficult to work out on a message board</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and better off done in a meeting where everyone is there in real time and can have the floor to speak where everyone will hear them at that very second. In messageboards, people pick and choose what to read, if to read at all- thus they miss lots of important stuff that makes them have incomplete info to make assumptions and oppinions with. <br>
<br>
Thus, it is my conclusion that the council of guilds (and individuals are allowed of course... what the hell do you think this is bougeious of only the powerful and privalleged in guilds?) is a good thing, and something that everyone who wants to be involved in should be involved in. The voices and knowledge of the many are the key to the answer for the whole. Farming guilds and groups that dominate whatever plane/uber mob they want <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is wrong and a thing of the past</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->... Everyone has a shot now, the way it should be. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Free and equal, where everyone has a say.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Is there something wrong with that, honestly?<br>
<br>
PS. Verant's stance on everything is none-involvement, unless people are being harrassed, abused, or they're abusing flaws in the game. Verant doesn't support or enforce calendars, but they <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NEVER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> said that we couldn't organize them ourselves. They probably never even thought that a server would organize enough to create something like a serverwide council open to all. And quite frankly, I'm sure they can't/won't/wouldn't want to do anything about it. They'd probably be tickled pink to see everyone working together and solving their own problems rather than acting like asses and petitioning all the time.<br>
<br>

<br>
You either have:<br>
<br>
a) A server with one dominant guild that takes whatever it wants and everyone fights for the leftovers<br>
<br>
b) or a server with a number of large guilds who make agreements among themselves<br>
<br>
c) or global rules (no different from the calendar).   On the Rathe (my old server); Dragons, Trak, and VS are all FFA spawns.   The dragon rule is the first to kill a gaint has rights to the Dragon spawn.  The VS rule is the first to have 12 in the prep room has right to the spawn.  As you can imagine, the races to these spawns get very nasty far beyond anything we have ever seen on this server.  In fact, The Rathe has far more rules than I hope we ever see on this server.<br>
<br>
Note:  From my experience of high level play on two different servers, PNP is widely considered the worst possible solution.  I have only seen PNP invoked once on this server, the players that tried to PNP the Arch Mage spawn no longer play as far as I know (couldnt handle the shame I guess).<br>
<br>
Kaldan, at least know the rules before you start spouting off.  The rules are not that you see if a spawn is taken and then just go somewhere else (those are player imposed rules, FYI).   The Verant rule is that you have to share, thats what PNP is all about.   Yes, that means Derv camps, Arch Mage spawns, Vox, Naggy, Trak, and the Planes.   It is player rules that have made these servers playable.  The reason you can hunt hunt in the crypt and not worry about another group come try to take it away from you is player made codes of conduct, not PNP.   Again, if PNP is invoked, you get to share the crypt and I know you dont want to do that.<br>

<br>
Kind of off subject but.....<br>
<br>
I have had PnP invoked on me once.  I could not believe it.  I had a full group killing guardians in GD.  We had just received the camp from another group that was there.<br>
<br>
Shortly after pulling the first guardian and killing it a player walked up and said she was pulling the other one for her group which then mysteriously appeared in front of us.  We told her the camp was taken.  To this she invoked the PnP policy.  I laughed and said whatever.  This group she had was all about 10 - 12 levels higher than us. So they were not getting any exp. She asked me if I wanted her to petition a GM so I said sure.  Well needless to say we pulled another guardian and had an elder spawn in the room and join the fight.  Our group got wiped out with absoluteluy no help from the other group.<br>
<br>
To make a long story short.  THE ONLY TIME I have ever seen someone invoke PNP is from players that are frigging greedy pharmers.<br>
<br>
I have always shared spawns with lots of people if they ask in a way like this.  &quot;Larisian, would you guys mind sharing the spawn with us?&quot;<br>
<br>
9 out of 10 times the answer is yes.  I want everyone to have a good time and that is something stupid to start arguing about.  But on the other hand when someone comes right into a camp and states we are taking the other spawn or next spawn and invokes PNP that is just not right or courteous especially if they are pharming.<br>
<br>
MY 2cp on PnP....it causes more problems then what we are trying to do with the calendar and server guidelines for Named Mobs, and planes. <p><FONT SIZE="+1">Be Safe!  Have Fun! No Dying!</FONT><BR>

I've camped the guardians before, and there are NO elders that spawnin that room, and no wanderers come in there, either. I've been in there for up to 6 hours at one time, so I'm sure I would have seen if there were any strange spawns or wanderers.<br>
