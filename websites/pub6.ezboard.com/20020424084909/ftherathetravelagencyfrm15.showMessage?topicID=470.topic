That has been admitted and actions are being taken to try and rectify.<br><br>To those of you that disliked SoT or had a bone to pick with them about something else...and you used this as another chance to take a shot at us...grow some balls.<br><br>To those idiots who expected members of SoT to log onto EQ and ./gr after reading the RTA board without finding out what happened and talking to their guild members...well your just @#%$ stupid.  I suppose you would have just @#%$ your friends over like that...friendship meaning so little to you?  Oh yah  to some of you  it does...you wrote of friendships with people in SoT  who werent even online at the time.<br><br>To those of you who think Shei is a horrible leader.  Your just uniformed.  Does he make mistakes? Yes.  Oh is he the only one who has that flaw?  Social graces might not be high on his list  but then again...its not high on mine either.   Shei has been a good friend to many of us in SoT for a long time..and id back him up in a heartbeat.  So @#%$ on his name all you want..he has his friends.<br><br>To you idiots out there sending harrassing tells to people  ( yes this includes any SoT person who sent any tells..)   you are childish and need a nice ass whooping. Grow up.  Personally Im sick of the tells i got.  Made me feel like acting like Haisama and threating to come kick you ass.  /shudder.<br><br>To those that think that the actions of the last week validate and confirm some of the gibberish written on these boards in the past few years..you  are  wrong.  Most of that crap was written with goals and objectives that were self serving in mind.<br><br>Sad to think that people forget all the good things a guild has done to help people..but thats human nature i guess.<br><br>Trompen , Im sorry for what happened.  If ya ever need anything let me know...altho it seems id have to get in line as half the server has offered you that lol.<br><br>SoT is a good guild...that makes some mistakes.  <br><br>Flame away.

I also must say alot of my negativity comes from others news/rumors that I hear, so im human i guess. Anyways good post this is getting old to alot of people im sure. I will say that I am definetly not agreeing with the whole &quot;KS was ok&quot; side it sucked and Trompen was @#%$ and didnt even get kissed first.<br>  Just an idea I had  to help sooth Trompens hurt and frustration. Maybe SoT takes him on a Big Raid that his guild cant do and gets him 1-2 pieces of very nice equip as a peace offering. Im sure if he gets a nice BP or Hand held item it will help his want/need for his new Epic for a little while(mind you epic is far better than this but....)

But don't expect people to take the apology at face value.. expect a long period of time where people will question your motives and actions.  <br><br>It will take a long time to forgive.. and an even longer time to forget, I suspect. (Not to mention you've given those who benefit by bashing you some amount of justification and ability to continue indefinitely without community lashback against them.)<br><br>By indirectly threatening the stability of the community with such a high profile mistake, the lashback was and will continue to be tremendous for you.<br><br>If nothing else, this will be a painful lesson.
