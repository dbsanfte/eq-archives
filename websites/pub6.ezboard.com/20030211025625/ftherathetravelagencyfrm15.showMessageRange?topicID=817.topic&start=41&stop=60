<br>
Why? Don't I have the right to not like something and speak out against it? Is anyone here against abortion?<br>
<br>
Now I am some horrible person and deserve the fucking torture rack because I think gays ask for too much privilage and I point out the obvious fact that it just isn't right.<br>
<br>
I guess that is the biggest tragedy of it all, people prejudge me for publicising my beliefs in this context. And they do so by saying how disgusted they are that I believe that way.<br>
I am supposed to be open minded about the gay lifestyle, but when I say how I really feel about it I become Satan himself and noone should have an open mind about my beliefs, because well they are wrong by default right?<br>
<br>
You can sit by and take a politicly correct stance if you want, but let's see how you feel when you have children and they come home and tell you about how homosexuality is a great alternative to a normal lifestyle, and in the same breath they ask why people are dieing of AIDS.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are lots of really cool people who are gay, unfortunatly there are lots of gays who need to just shut the fuck up and go about there business. Just as there are people who feel the way I do and manifest it with violence. I think they need to shut the fuck up and sit down as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seerfamily>Seer Family</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 10:41:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Grullin the homophobe</span><hr size=1> &lt;I wouldn't even consider them to be part of the human race, &lt;let alone a social race with their own rights and privilages. <br>
<br>
This is your truth?<br>
<br>
You confuse truth with your assinine opinion.<br>
<br>
Are you satan because you have this &quot;opinion&quot; , no you are just insensitive and ignorant.<br>
<br>
However, those who try to enlighten you are not going away and have just as much right to voice their opinions.<br>
<br>
As to your being offended by the equation of racial issues being more important that homosexual rights. Homosexuals are not granted the same rights as everyone else. That is reality and in some states as archaic as it may seem, even some things heterosexuals do and consider &quot;normal&quot; are technically illegal, but it is only enforced on homosexuals.<br>
<br>
And as to your uninformed judgemental attitude about AIDS, there are lots of heterosexuals dying from that disease, in fact the original population effected was heterosexual prostitutes in africa.<br>
<br>
<br>
And as to the original point of this thread, glad to hear th problem may soon be resolved. <p>Caitsith  53 Mage<br>

However, the law thinks differently, hence they have marches, and pride rallies and all that other shit.  It is illegal for them to marry.......why?? what effect does that have on me??  As far as I can tell none, so let them get married, it doesn't effect my tax dollars, it doesn't change what they are doing, hell it doesn't even matter short of what happens when one of them dies(or get's hospitalized etc.etc.etc.)  If a straight person that is married ends up in a coma, who takes care of their bussines?  That's right, their spouse.  If a homosexual ends up in a coma their parents take care of it.....even if they are 50 years old and haven't spoken to their parents in 30 years.<br>
<br>
Also, it was alluded to earlier that it is illegal to have homosexual acts.  This is true, in the state that I live in, any sexual act that is not penile/vaginal is illegal.  This also makes Blowjobs illegal, so you can imagine how long this law has been ignored.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the law on the books is against their way of life.  Therefore they have a right to be upset, and march, and petition the goverment.  <br>
<br>
On a side note, I wanna have a little experiment in double standards.  I want all you straight guys out there to picture in your mind two guys, muscular adults making out.....I mean really picture it.  Now in your mind you are saying eeewww.  Now, clear that image out of your head.  Now I want you to picture two really hot women naked, kissing and fondling each other.<br>
<br>
That's a double standard, and yet still it's a way of life <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I know it's a cop-out, but sometimes it's true....that's just the way it is.  Anytime we have one standard for some, and others for others, it's considered unfair and biased.  Welcome to the human race.  Everyone is biased, everyone covets their own belief system.  Everyone thinks they are right.<br>
<br>
What Homosexuals want to do on their own time is none of my damn business (unless I get a phone call from those hot lesbian chicks, and they need a little help).  On the flip side of that, I am sick as fuck of hearing the term &quot;breeder&quot; in a derogetory fasion(sp?).  I try my best not to inadvertantly offend anyone.  But the same doesn't apply across the board.  If I'm ordering dinner in a resturaunt and some homosexual refers to me as a &quot;breeder&quot;, and I in kind refer to him as a fag; which one of us is being insensitive?  If I'm walking down the street and a black guy refers to me as &quot;cracker&quot; am I within my rights to call him a &quot;nigger&quot;?  Why is it if I do I'm the racist and not him??<br>
<br>
People in general just piss me off<br>

So now I am insensitive and ignorant because of my views on homosexuals. If you think that then I guess that you are insensitive and ignorant as well. Seeing as how you disagree with my way of thinking, that MUST make you insensitive and ignorant.<br>
<br>
Homosexuals aren't granted the same rights as everyone else? I did not know that. Please tell me what rights they are missing out on, Are they not protected by the Bill of Rights? Are they not allowed to vote? I know, maybe they have no right to bear arms. Do they not have the right to free speaach? Please inform this insensitive ignorant moron of the rights that these people are being denied.<br>
<br>
Please tel me what a homophobe is? Am I supposed to be offened by that term or flattered? What exactly is it that the homophobe is suposed to be afraid of?

<br>
The laws you guys are talking about are stupid, very very very stupid.<br>
<br>
They are still laws, how the police or whatever choose to enforce them and whom they enforce them on has nothing to do with me.<br>

<br>
When my friend died, his life partner (they can't marry by the way..) was not acknowledged in the obit, was not allowed to take the ashes in spite of a will to the contrary, and had some of his belonging confiscated by the family who had not cared for dearly departed in over 15 years.<br>
<br>
And had the family had their way, fortunately there were some folks at teh hospice who thought differently he wouldn't have even been allowed to be there when he died.<br>
<br>
Try treating a married spouse that way.<br>
<br>
And it is police officers with your attitude that bias how those laws are enforced. Everytime you voice your attitude you reinforce for someone out there that you are right and these are facts. <br>
<br>
Your bigotry isn't based on facts it is based on your revulsion of something you don't understand.<br>
Homophobia isn't fear of homosexuals, it is fear of being homosexual and the emotional reaction created when confronted by individuals who arouse that fear.<br>
<br>
It was ok to abuse blacks until people started speaking up ...and speaking up everytime someone voiced that kind of hatred and ignorance.<br>
So yes you can bitch and whine and I can continue to explain to you why you are part of the problem.<br>

<br>
He was not the spouse, so the next of kin had all the funeral rights etc. I didn't make the law, I have no problem if they want to get married. I find it difficult to believe that there was a legal will and it was not followed, If you are in someone's legal will it doesn't matter what the relationship is, by law it is followed. Maybe you should look into whether or not the will was legal or not.<br>
<br>
I don't hate anyone, I don't despise anyone, and I don't want to see anyone get harmed. What I do want is for them to shut the fuck up with their bitching. If homosexuality is mentioned in schools I want it to be in a way that promotes acceptance or tolerance, not in a way that promotes it as an alternate lifestyle. If you are gay then I'm sure there's nothing you or I could do to stop you from being gay, but I'll be damned if you're going to cry about it and teach MY kids that it's cool to be gay.<br>
<br>
There is a difference between having a conviction about something and having a burning hate about it, and to be quite frank I am sensing hatred from you towards my way of thinking. You seem to hate me, because I am personifying something bad that has happened to you or to someone you love. Maybe you should think about why you feel the way you do, is it because your friends died of AIDS? Or is it because you really feel like gays are getting screwed over. (no pun intended)<br>
<br>
It sounds like you may need to see a specialist, and work on your anger issues. I'm done with this thread, all you do is look through my posts and try to rip slurs out of my posts that make you angry. I listen to you but you don't return that favor. If I can open my mind and accept that there are gay people and that they are even people, I think that I deserve to be heard as much as them, but if I say anything I am a biggot and an insensitive homophobe.<br>

What's the difference?  I see zero.<br>
<br>
Why hate gay people?  They aren't bothering you.  They don't &quot;want&quot; you, so relax.  <br>
<br>
Try worrying about important stuff that affects you and your family directly, (ie, taxes, healthcare, etc.) when you run out of those things then waste some time worrying about the little shit that has absolutely no bearing on your life.<br>
<br>
Stop being scared of gay people, jeesh.  Climb out of your caves people, there's a whole world out there that does things differently than how your Ma and Pa taught you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grullin>Grullin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 3:13:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Grullin the homophobe</span><hr size=1> I' m not scared of gay people, but it seems they are scared of me, why else would they be crying so much about the rights that they al-fucking-ready have......<br>

What if sexual preference really is determined by something that happens in the womb. That would put homos in the same category as mentally retarded people. Then they could have their own special &quot;Gay Olympics&quot; and maybe they would shut the fuck up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=euminenchantiflyer>Eumin Enchantiflyer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 3:59:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=52>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://monkey.thirty4.com/images/eq/tindi/450.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Grullin the homophobe</span><hr size=1> Gay people are gay.<br>
<br>
Now .. was that an insult, or a fact!?  You decide!<br>
<br>
I belive that any and all people should e able to marry.  I don't mind gays, I have gay friends ... I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO for gods sakes!   I do see what Grullin is saying.  He is being shot down, and called names because of his views.  Just like some people shoot down gays for thier views =P<br>
<br>
The only thing gays don't have that the rest of us have, is marrage.  Otherwise, they have the same rights.  Sure, sometimes there are hate crimes, but they are not the only ones who have hate crimes agesn't them.  <br>
<br>
Everyone is going to be hated by someone .. some people hate me, i'm not gay or a minority, it happens (I wish it didn't), but it needs to be accepted. <p><CENTER>

This does not provide the same benefits as marriage; social security death benefits, tax breaks, and several other benefits to being married do not apply to these civil unions.  Vermont is currently the only state which allows anything approximating marriage for gay couples.<br>
<br>
Until gays have all the SAME rights as straight couples, they have every right to be vocal about it.  Equal rights are not special rights.  I've never heard one gay person say they wanted something more than what straight people have; they just want the same opportunities and to have their unions legally recognised.<br>
<br>
When women marched and protested to get the vote, I'm sure a lot of people wished they would stfu.  When blacks protested and marched on the capital for equal rights, I KNOW a lot of white people wanted them to stfu.  The situation now is that there is again a specific group of people in this country who are being denied the same basic rights that everyone else in this country has.<br>
<br>
As for the issue of using gay, queer, and fag as insults . . . when someone is viewed as being &quot;cheap,&quot; it is no longer socially acceptable to refer to them as being a &quot;jew.&quot;  It's rude and disrespectful at best, and quite a slap in the face for Jewish individuals.  Jew and gay/fag/queer are both terms used to describe a specific group of people by the members of those groups and others in society.  Both groups of people deserve the same respect.  If you're still not understanding why it's rude and disrespectful to call someone a fag because they're a thief, then I really don't know how else to put it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=324074">Sionach An'Talamh</a>, Outrider of Tunare

<br>
I don't think that being able to marry whoever you want is really a civil right, I mean social security is not a civil right by any means, if you ask me social security is stupid. That's just my opinion. I can see the governments side of it as well, social security was put into place for families, if the man who put it into place were around to see it benefitting same sex couples I think his heart would seize.<br>
<br>
They are wanting to be able to rip off the government by accepting benefits from social security and in no way shape or form even being able to increase the base of tax paying citizens.<br>
<br>
To say social security is a civil right is assanigned, so please find another word to call it bacausethe term &quot;gay rights&quot; applied here is just plain poop.<br>
<br>
As for saying that calling someone a Jew is rude? At fucking least being a Jew is something that a person can be born into and be proud of. Just like being Black, Hispanic, Anglo, Asian, Indian, Australian, American, Cuban whatever. Things that in the past have sometimes set us apart in a negative way, but in a way have allowed us to be special people and part of a group. Things that define who we are. Being fucking gay does NOT fall into that category.<br>
<br>
Noone is born into a race that is defined by trying to screw a bolt into another bolt, or put a nut onto the other nut. <br>
<br>
Half of the world is afraid they will lose their job for saying the word gay out loud and not because of the lack of same sex marriages, it's because of crying, whining, bitching homos who cry when someone calls them a bad name and who have no idea of what real oppression is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therealdrache>TheRealDrache</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 9:06:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ....</span><hr size=1> I don't think everyone and thier mom needs to have a new law protecting them because they want to do something.<br>
 I really don't see a reason to pass out new laws for people that are crying for new ones. Gays don't need any new rights, they are just humans that choose to inject semen into each other's anal passages and sample each other's mansauce. <br>
<br>
Think of it this way..... If I fell in love with a dead woman's corpse, do I get the right to marry it? Do we actually need new laws that provide us with the options of doing any fucking thing we feel like? If each person of the Native American community wanted rights to execute one white man each under a vendetta law for what happened to them in the past, I highly doubt they will get that law passed.

<br>
I dont think in all my time around gay men, that I have EVER heard one refer to the other as a fag or gay.<br>
<br>
They generally describe them the same way a heterosexual male/female would describe the other sex, as hot/sexy/cute/etc./etc.<br>
<br>
Secondly, there are plenty of gay people, and I have met them, who hate straight people for the same reasons there are straight people who hate gays, so dont act like they are perfect.<br>
<br>
That doesnt mean all gays are bad, nor does it mean all straight people are bad. Know what it means?<br>
<br>
It means you can still be a complete ignorant fuckstick nomatter your sexual preference.<br>
<br>
Also, that thing about imagining two girls together and two guys together...I dont see how that relates at all.<br>
<br>
I can imagine two girls together without cringing because I am straight, therefor girls please me, and guys dont.<br>
<br>
Just like a straight female may or may not enjoy thinking about two guys giving it to each other.<br>
<br>
I fail to see the double standard here, I just see another example of personal sex preference. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Comic Sans;font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK
