Not just those who can come up with 40+.<br>
<br>
I would support this too Jamany, and probably everyone else on the server would support this also.  This would be a great system!<br>
<br>
&gt;I have tried writing it out several ways and you CANNOT include everyone on a server.<br>
<br>
/ponder<br>
<br>
Here lies the problem Jamany, let's take a closer look shall we?  You would support an idea that would include EVERYONE but it is impossible to do that.  What is the next best thing to do in this case?  <br>
<br>
/ponder<br>
<br>
I KNOW!!!  How about the calendar system?  <br>
<br>
&gt;Once again you fail to realize that I do not now nor will I EVER agree, use, or consider this calender valid.<br>
<br>
Well shit, now what...<br>
<br>
&gt;I am stating the fact that I have the right to go.<br>
<br>
Geezus Cheeerist Jamany, so does everyone else!<br>
<br>
&gt;I am also stating that there is NOTHING you can do about it.<br>
<br>
Your right, there is nothing I can do about it.  But once again, if I am in a plane, and you come in and train me (and it WILL happen, no way to avoid it) YOU will be reported for disrupting my game play.  YOU will be removed from the zone by the GM, just like &quot;that one guild&quot;.  And you will be added to my shit list.  It's plain and simple that you are unwilling to cooperate here Jamany.  You said yourself that there is no way to include everyone, so in your mind that puts the planes in an FCFS status.  So I guess that is the way you must hope to enter the planes, because if someone else is there first you will train them and disrupt their game play.  You tried to come up with a plan to include everyone and said yourself it couldn't be done, but you refuse to go to the next best thing, thus making the planes FCFS when YOU decide to go.  You refuse to budge/cooperate/adjust/bend/tweek/ or anything else concerning the calendar.  You have no more input and you refuse to offer any sort of alternative for bettering the current system.  As far as threats go, the quote...&quot;you made your bed, you lie in it&quot; comes to mind.  Had you been more reasonable and willing to cooperate perhaps you wouldn't FEEL so threatened (how one can feel threatened in a GAME is beyond me).  Now that we all know where you stand, I see no further reason for you to post concerning this matter.<br>
<br>
&gt;I have every right to post here and every right to read the posts here.<br>
<br>
Yes you do, but since you are obviously offering no constructive input concerning bettering the current calendar system you are &quot;trolling&quot; this board and your comments are no longer welcome.  And if you continue to annoy me here on this msg board I will just save myself the trouble of seeing you in-game and add you to my shit list right now if you continue to do so. (see my sentence above about making your bed...)<br>

None of us likes the idea of someone taking over a plane which your guild has waited a month for, but your constant posts which add nothing, but criticism (sp) are really not welcome.<br>
<br>
The fact is about 90% of the people on this server either agree or live with the policies of the calendar.  You have stated yourself that there is no way to include everyone in planes raids, so why not try to work with the system we have now which has been up for almost two years.  It can be made to work better, but going against the grain doesn't help at all.  If and when you actually post something constructive in this situation perhaps then people will look at you differently, until then most will just think of you as a troll. <p>  Only in death are our souls set free.<br>

I know it is falconus and I did type the wrong name.  But I do need to make a few valid points.<br>
<br>
Seeing as the people on here seem to want to stoop to a low level fine.  But I am letting you know that after a brief conversation with a GM today (which the text is saved) it will be noted and sent to verant that you are considering me zoning into a plane at anytime of my choosing an interuption of game play and that you are claiming a zone.  (I copied your text and emailed it to him).  <br>
<br>
Also, when I started commenting on the calender I was as polite as I could be.  I tried to make alternate suggestions to make the calender work for all but instead of getting a simple &quot;I cannot see how this would be able to work&quot; or a simple &quot;explain how we can accomplish this&quot; , I got the plain and simple &quot;you are a troll&quot;  &quot;leave the calender alone it works&quot; and the ever popular &quot;you cannot come in here and tell us what to do because the entire server backs this calender&quot;....these are all remarks in which I had gotten months ago when I started to question the calender.  So maybe just maybe you can see how things have gotten out of control.  I do NOT threaten, harass, insult, or degrade anyone.  I state simple facts.  And instead of intelligent responses I get name calling and pathetic attempts at humorous insults.<br>
<br>
That is why things have gotten the way the are.  And point blank if you don't think anything I have to say is valid then why.....why do you bother reading let alone bother responding to my posts? <p>JAMANY FUGMZELOR<br>

If you INTENTIONALLY start zoning in when certain people are there thats harrassment.

This will be based on past posts between us and your comments of im coming and you cant stop me. I have said it once and will say it again, do what you want as long as you dont stick you nose in my face were cool. The only action is that you get ostricized. Send that TEXT to a gm. I listened to your idea and told you why it wouldnt work but you were the one who did not send constructive critism back. You assumed i was closeminded. I have the tech, leadership, and education background to PROMISE that what you suggest is not feasible. Now if you were to have every 40 people choose a rep to speak for them of all the server then its feasible.

The Calender system is a modern way to handle a democraty (typo?) problem... <br>
Sure this system do not benefit the 46+ players without a guild/posting rights etc, but that's such a small amount of people and you can't look at all concerns. There for you choice to go with the majority...<br>
Without the Calender system you choice not to have any laws (which is also known as Anarchy) and most people, including myself will not support this kind of system.<br>
With the calender system you have to have rules, and you have to be punished if you do not follow the rules (very ordinary way to handle a problem, which is supported by 99% of the people on earth <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
I might be a little way out of the topic here, because I didn't bothered to read all the threads, but anyway I kind of like Jamanys statements. It's indeed a different opinion which by the way I do not support at all, but always nice to see well thought statements (supported by facts) and just not the ordinary &quot;F (insert flame name here)&quot; <p><font color=#345618>
