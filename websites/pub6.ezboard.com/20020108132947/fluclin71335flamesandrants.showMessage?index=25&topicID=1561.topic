<br>
- Grew up in a strict Irish Catholic neighborhood where most parents had no compunction about beating your butt. Some of my best friends were *never* allowed out on school nights. Ever. One even had good enough grades to finish 10th in his class. It didn't matter. After 6pm, they were in for the night and no one could come over.<br>
<br>
- Same for nuns. I once watched my 8th grade teacher finally snap and beat someone about the head with his hardcover math textbook because he would never do his homework. If you took the time to get to knw her, she could be pretty cool, but she had a *really* short fuse. She had a habit I have, constantly pacing around the room when thinking or speaking, so when teaching she would roam about while tapping her yardstick against her palm. I never saw her use it on anyone, but it was intimidating <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  In grade school you always knew which nuns were &quot;safe&quot; and which ones would snap you in half if you got out of line.<br>
<br>
- In HS both principals (the first one got transferred to run another school when I was a junior) would break up fights half by separating the two (or more) combatants and half by beating them into submission. No exaggerating, folks. Ive seen it.<br>
<br>
- I saw HS teachers *deck* students in front of God and everyone if the kids really crossed the line (telling them to go **** themselves, for instance). For lesser stuff you might get beaned by an eraser, or one teacher would crack some real troublemakers on the head with his class ring. The philosophy there was, make an example of the troublemakers and the rest will stay in line. And for whatever reason no one complained (shrug).<br>
<br>
- Of course, St. James didn't have any girls, and all the teachers were guys, so there was no one to impress and it was pretty darn regimented. Add a strict dress code with slacks, dress shoes, dress socks, shirts, and ties to that.<br>
<br>
- One teacher's nickname was &quot;cat&quot; because if you ever messed with him he would hit you so fast (like a cat) you'd never see it coming. Not that the rest were pushovers either...<br>
<br>
- And if none of the above was enough to keep all of us little cretins in line, the dean of the school was a MAJOR IN THE U.S. MARINE CORPS RESERVE. I kid you not. He made Lt. Colonel sometime after I  graduated. He was actually a very nice guy, but you did *not* mess with him. Ever.<br>

Then the next time he was alone you couldtell from the look in his eyes he knew he was gettin it bad<br>

Unfortunately Meren you can't fight a flame war with anyone because you are too busy talking about their goals and/or their RL sexual experiences.  You come off like Ms Moet who posts &quot;yo mama ass stink&quot; except that you're not anon when you're doing it (And you can speak english, which I have to concede to you).  Next time you attempt to write a flame, use actual examples like &quot;Meren is an ex-EQ player and loser who shows up once a month and posts dumb hateful drivel&quot; or &quot;Meren can't post quality flames at all because he's an idiot who thinks a girl in a red suit is a funny personal icon.&quot;  I think you've pretty much worn out Luclin's patience with your dumbass posts (You've certainly worn out mine).  Time to shut the f*ck up! <p><EMBED src=http://darkrad.homestead.com/files/newsig.swf loop=true quality=high

It was interesting seeing how people change when you live with 'em 24 / 7.  Like the first week or so, all the girls got all made up and the guys wore cologne and junk.  After awhile, though, people just got tired of it and were coming to class with curlers in their hair and some people in their pajamas.  It's funny how you just don't care about impressing people after you've lived with 'em for like 3 weeks straight.  <br>
<br>
The coolest thing was the freedom we had in class.  We could bring sodas or food or whatever as long as we didn't disturb the rest of the students, and if we wanted a course taught, like say astrophysics, we just found a willing teacher and got them to put it on the curriculum for the next semester.  Of course, it helped that all of the teachers had at least a Masters degree in the subjects they taught (not a Masters in education), and each department head had to have a PhD as part of the job requirement.  So you could actually talk with them about the subject material and they didn't have to rely on the teacher's manual.<br>
<br>
As for the dorms, they were seperated into boys floors and girls floors, and we weren't allowed to go to the other.  Though one of my friends had a totally genius method of getting his girlfriend to his dormroom.  He had this large box his TV had come in, and every now and then he'd get a &quot;new&quot; TV.  Funny that security never caught on that this guy was getting like 3 &quot;TV's&quot; per week or something. <p>Sbik Swashbucklugget<br>

Most anyone that has taken any type of martial arts class should know that the best way to fight is to incapacitate the other person but not to harm them in anger. <br>
<br>
This being said, I am most likely one of the few girls you will meet that would have a hard time living up to this. I am not buff, I am not butch, not in shape in the least but I have a lot of agression built up. <br>
(and just because I haven't posted a RL pic isn't reasons for anyone to say that I am most likely a bull dyke chick, I just have co workers that I don't want knowing that Miyon is me) <br>
I am that rare girl that would love to get in a brawl with someone, male or female. And it wouldnt be a hair pulling thing. <br>
My point in this is, though I don't like to see other people hurt, and I live and play my character to help people, a good fight in RL would be exciting for me. Now if a girl can feel this way, then for the others out there that dont agree with some of the stuff posted here about fighting, just understand that it is pretty much in the genitic makeup for men to be agressive and fighting if just something they are going to do. <br>
<br>
It is not an unintelligent man that fights, its just a unintelligent man that starts fights to hurt people. <br>
