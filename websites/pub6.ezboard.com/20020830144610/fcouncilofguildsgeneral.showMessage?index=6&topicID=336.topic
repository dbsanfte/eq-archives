<br>
However, this body really doesn't have much sway over the issue anyway. It is an issue more the Karana Guild Central, who controls the player-generated rules for rotations. I can tell you that even in my time in the game, Ragefire was hotly debated there, including the possibility of setting a rotation for it. I'm not too sure that a rotation would help all that much, given the importance of this camp to most guilds.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

My guild used to be a mid level guild of friends and yet this week we joined the NToV rota... there was no one holding us back.<br>
<br>
Of course the big guilds aren't going to support a rotation on RF because it is a waste of their time. It isn't greed and spite and it certainly isn't Skrim's fault.<br>
<br>
Guilds will not ever leave the RF rotation bacause cleric's come and go its not like you equip all your clerics with epics and then you are set forever. People retire and new people join. So every guild knows that in the future they will need RF.<br>
<br>
If RF was on rotation then guilds would get cleric epics at a rate of 1 per year which is a joke where as if an up and coming guild really gets its act together it can grab a few in a couple of weeks and get a real leg up.<br>
<br>
When my guild wants to finish a cleric epic we get a group in SF and keep them there 24/7 till RF pops and then gather quickly. I don't think we have missed out on a single one as yet.<br>
<br>
The system isn't perfect but in my opinion it is better than the alternatives. And it does work. <p><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bthesilentwatchmb ><img src=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/chris.thackray/warder.jpg border=0></a>

But there are alternative solutions that are being discussed on KGC.  The one that I am really pushing there is a Semi FFA idea, of forcing guilds to sit out so many weeks between kills, in order to spread the wealth yet leave enough room for ambitious guilds to be able to get the ones they need.  There are some other modified rotations that are out there, that are interesting and could work in a pinch.  Unfortunately the fact is that a solution is not going to happen on these boards, they will happen on the KGC boards.  So you will have to trust your Guild Leaders and Officers to speak for you, and tell them to speak up because too many are being quiet. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

<br>
I would have no problem with a semi FFA rotation sounds fair to me but we all know GH NB etc etc can mobilize the entire guild in 5 mins and be there. Then you have the guilds that can kill ragefire and perhaps weaseled a scroll from the king by trading or another guilds help in chardok. You dont need many people to kill rage hes pretty damn easy as far as dragons go perhaps the easiet. Then the cleric goes to camp ragefire he pops but his guild is not online or cant get there quiet fast enough and bam GH or NB (which im using as examples not accusing at all have the utmost respect for GH and NB) swoops in kill rage and leaves just as quickly. Something needs to be done but the old clerics that suffered from ragefire camp in solb like skirm refuse to acknowledge that there needs to be another alternative. Either the KGC supports all requested rotations or they shouldnt support any at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>KCoG Founder</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(8/16/02 2:18:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.godwinclients.com/sd/haemish_new.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rf can something be done??</span><hr size=1> First off, again, THIS BOARD IS NOT THE KGC. This isn't really the place to discuss the KGC because that is being done over there quite well. <br>
<br>
Secondly, the ragefire problem is not one that can be solved by a rotation. There is just too much at stake for all guilds involved in it to come up with an equitable solution. The problem isn't with the KGC, it's with the spawn itself, which means it is in Verant's hands. And they will not recognize any rotation on non-Stormhammer servers. So the players will have to agree and on this mob, FFA has been the only solution that can be agreed upon. Again, take up the issue with your KGC representatives, they are your advocates in this matter.<br>

RF isn't gonna get &quot;fixed&quot; or thrown on &quot;rotation&quot; because there is no way to set one up and no one is interested. And by the way, just because a guild has the ABILITY to swing in and kill RF out from under your nose, does not mean they do. I only know of 2 guilds of questionable ethics that have knowingly KSed RF and were both aptly punished for it with GM interference. <p><center> <img src=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/flarren/LagKommipic.gif> </center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udreamswalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DreamsWalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Companion</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(8/19/02 5:40:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rf can something be done??</span><hr size=1> I personally dont care wheater you consider it tasteful or not I simply spoke the truth so that even those people outside the KGC know what goes on instead of being treated like mushrooms. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulaldiien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>laldiien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(8/20/02 10:32:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rf can something be done??</span><hr size=1> Wow.

<br>
While speaking the truth is usually a plus, sharing information that was divulged in confidence *IS* distasteful, and demonstrates an extreme lack of character. Court cases are lost that way, and people are executed for treason for the same reasons. <br>
<br>
Personally, I am not overly concerned with the Ragefire debate. That doesn't mean it isn't important, just not something that I need to take notice of. If it were something that I, or by extension, my Guild was concerned with then I would request access to the boards and chuck my opinion there, where it belongs. At that point, I would leave the boards, and allow those with the privilege of reading debate.<br>

Yes this server does need a split, but i don't forsee it SWG is nearly out EQ 2 will follow it if anything i see fewer servers and customer support over the next 1 to 2 years Verant doing the very minimal to support EQ1 after EQ2 and SWG have a solid customer base as the already stated last expansion Exodus looms closer every day.

<br>
-KGC is not secret, but it is the council of the leaders of Karana.  Does that mean that you should not know anything about what goes on behind those doors?  No, it doesn't, that is for your representatives (Guild Leader and Officers with access) to KGC to inform you about however, not an anonymous troll with a chip the size of an ogre on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
-Are there things about KGC that I would like to see changed?  You bet there are, but this isn't the place to gripe about them.  I think things could be changed for the better, but I will say that the system there allows things to be discussed a lot better than a FFA system.  Without KGC those small guilds that get &quot;brushed aside&quot; wouldn't even be able to exist, just look at other servers and see what happens there.  I value being in a small guild with people I know I can trust while still being able to do targets like planes and Naggy/Vox, and if I cannot get everything my way I am not going to whine.  As one of the guild leaders of a small guild that has had ideas &quot;brushed aside&quot; by GH/NB and numerous others (including on the RF topic itself), I at least go to the effort to understand the reasoning behind it.  What you don't seem to understand the enforcement of anything, because the fact is that if Nightbane, Valoran, and Grey Hawke (Just names picked out of the air) all decide that they don't agree with KCoG and go rogue, then there probably will not be enough support levied against them to make them regret it.  That is what it comes down to unfortunately, is that there has to be a way to punish a guild in order to enforce order, and if there is not enough support for a rule then how does it get enforced?  If one rule is not enforced, then what becomes of the others?  If something like that happens then the system will crash, and personally I like the system, as most people on the server do.<br>
<br>
-How do you have access to the KGC boards?  Sounds like you got access to them by some accident and have been trolling around.    That is just my gut feeling with no supporting evidence since I don't even know who you are.  There is a reason that access to KGC is restricted, and from this thread I would say that people like you are basically that reason.<br>
<br>
-Again, let me repeat what several people have already said.  This is KCoG, not KGC.  This discussion does not belong here.  It belongs on KGC.  If you have a problem with it either go there yourself if you can, or get your officers to do so and speak for you. <p>Farrnusno <BR>

The KGC information may not be &quot;secret&quot; but it is &quot;private.&quot; Thus divulging the particulars of discussions within there is somewhat ethically suspect, especially if it is without the involved parties knowledge or consent. Kind of like posting private emails. <br>

I would also like to point out that SWG has recently been delayed until at least 2003, so don't count the EQ Doomsday clock up yet.  <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>

A splinter guild from FoF that I am embarassed to call old guildmates. Some of the rest of FoF has reconciled, but obviously animocity is still rampant.<br>
<br>
If you would mind please Haemish locking this thread, and if someone could post to the KGC board linking this thread, I believe Skirm needs to know about his breech of security and what was said about him so he can have his own fair chance to respond to Yizelar's obvious lack of respect for others. <p><center> <img src=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/flarren/LagKommipic.gif> </center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=336.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=336.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=336.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=336.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.threadControl?topicID=336.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=336.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=336.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="councilofguildsgeneral">General<option value="councilofguildscouncildiscussions">Council Discussions<option value="councilofguildsevents">Events<option value="councilofguildscogplanesraidschedule">CoG Planes Raid Schedule<option value="councilofguildsfrm8">CoG Dragon Raids<option value="councilofguildsguildwars">Guildwars<option value="councilofguildshelpitemswanted">KCoG Bazaar<option value="councilofguildsintroduceyourguild">Introduce Your Guild<option value="councilofguildsguildalliances">Guild Alliances</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsgeneral>General</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
