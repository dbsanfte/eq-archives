<br>
To also totally disregard someone's post and tell them they are whiners is a touch rude as well. There are a thousand ways you can say the same thing...sadly some people's vocabularies are painfully limited.<br>

<br>
My first instinct when I hear a small guild, is a guild with maybe 40 members that are levels 50 to 60 and the majority of those low 50s.  I'm thinking of a pre-HoT guild that is still having raids in KD for gear, and Sev is the only rotation mob it can kill.  However, &quot;small&quot; is not a good term for this becuase a guild of 12 people, that are all level 65, could be considered small and could mobilize quite easily against Sev at any given time.  So for lack of a better term, lets call this type of guild a &quot;hoodlie&quot; guild.<br>
<br>
If a guild is forced to pass after two guilds beat it onto a rotation, then I think these hoodlie guilds would most likely be the ones ending up having to pass.  The 24 hour window to kill Sev was set up for these hoodlie guilds to allow them to kill the mob in their prime time.  This is becuase the hoodlie guild can only manage the force capable to kill Sev during its prime time.  To force a hoodlie guild to pass, Sev would have to spawn and be killed twice in a row, each time before the guild's prime time.<br>
<br>
There are many guilds out there that have the members and the levels to kill Sev at any moment of the day.  These guilds don't have to wait for their prime time.  They only have to send out a small force to take out the mob.  Now how often do you think these guilds will be forced to pass on Sev?<br>
<br>
One of the main purposes of rotations is to give guilds, who would normally get &quot;out raced&quot;, the oppurtuntity to kill highly desired mobs.  If Sev was FFA, Hoodlie guilds would be the guilds that would get out raced.  By making a forced pass rule, you would be making it more difficult for them to participate in the rotation which in turn nullifies one of the main purposes of having a rotation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hutterr>Hutterr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/5/02 5:57:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=887.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rotation Rules?</span><hr size=1> I have to agree with rogg on every point. This really has become more of a heated issue than it needs to be.<br>
<br>
Sev, in my opinion is simply the first (because its the easiest) rot mob to see this problem. It wont be the last. More and more guilds are becoming strong enough to enter various rotations.<br>
<br>
The &quot;new&quot; system as it has been suggested would not limit content for anyone. Its sole purpose is the exact opposite. If guild A is up and loses a &quot;race&quot; once, then they know they HAVE to be ready the next week. If they are busy &quot;frying bigger (or different) fish&quot; perhaps they should think about scheduling the bigger fish around their rotation obligations.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt even be opposed to allowing 2 guilds per &quot;turn&quot; to enter without penalty, but guild A MUST kill on the third spawn or lose their turn. If 10 guilds enter all at once, the practicality of the rotation is destroyed because NO ONE can plan for their kill.<br>
<br>
Im all for new guilds entering rotation (as we're not on Sev yet), but I dont want my guild to enter the alliance as one of many holding back people who have been planning for a month to finally get their epic. If I push em back a week cause im the only guild jumpin in, so be it, but 3 or 4+ weeks is a little rediculous. If a guild on a rotation loses that many times, it seems fairly obvious that its not much of a priority for them. <br>
<br>
The chances of an &quot;off time&quot; spawn 2 (or 3 as I said before) weeks in a row where other 24/7 guilds that arent already on rotation are ready is so unbelievably slim its not funny. Im a guild with about 50 members, 40 of which are 50+ in an alliance with guilds that bring our numers up to around 100. We couldnt take Sev at 8AM EST either, so there is one fairly powerful small to mid end guild/alliance you dont need to worry about. I assure you most of us ready for Sev are in the same boat.<br>
<br>
Im not sure if this lends any credence to the argument, but *IM* the one youre defending Abaz, and Rogg's arguments make more sense. No need to be upset, but we have rules that force a timely kill already for the purpose of moving things along, why would it be wrong to have rules to enforce that a guild progress the rotation? <p>Hutterr Verbruggen<br>

Please show me where I desregarded a post and just called someone &quot;whiners&quot;. This mythical post would be amusing to read. If you would get past the perceived slights and just read the posts, you would see I made it painfully clear why i thought the way I did and why I thought the proposed change was unfair.<br>
<br>
Trying to deflect attention from the points I was trying to raise by acting as if I just made a huge flaming grulnick-like post is disingenious (like that would better than &quot;bullshit&quot;?). The amount of personal attacks and this stated &quot;You're showing yourself who you are in your posts blah blah blah&quot; crap is unwarranted, and immaterial to the discussion. I would love for you are rog to show where I am just flaming and where all these posts are I am showing myself to be the kind of person you seem to think I am. Being opinionated and willing to meticulously defend that opinion for as long as you hold it is not something to be scoffed at. If my wording offends you, then hey, I apologize. I rarely intend to offend anyone. But a thicker skin would do you well if that was the case.<br>
<br>
This issue *has* become far more heated than necessary, but why is that? I recommend people read this entire thread over from start to finish and make up there own minds, as there are far too many posts that seem to be addressing posts that don't exist, or personal interpretations of intent in posts, rather than what was actually said.<br>

Lets be sure we understand each other: Abazagaroth started this discussion with a jackass tone, when everyone else was trying to talk rationally about the situation.

Ah, I see. My saying &quot;the rotation is so big that eventually people will get fed up with the wait, and go FFA on the mob&quot; is the same as saying &quot;Your hair is brown, you're wrong.&quot; <br>
<br>
I'm sorry, how would you like me to argue? Would you like me to start abusing people's ideas? <br>
<br>
Alrighty, I can do that. Watch to see if you can spot the similarities of my post and another's that you may recognize.<br>
<br>
This whole conversation is bullshit.<br>
<br>
The rotations and the rules are in place to allow people to get on the rotation and continue to have access to the mob. These guilds can kill the mob and wanted on the rotation. Oh, what's the problem? You might have to actually mobilize for a mob that you claim to want, but don't want to go kill if it's not totally 'convienient'? Boo Hoo.<br>
<br>
Movelog to a smaller server, or accept the fact that in this particular instance the rot will become longer and longer because (Verant) has decided to keep limiting the number of green scales entering the game via sev, and the rotation won't hold up as they get to a four, five, six month wait, and will collapse to FCFS/FFA on this server. <br>
<br>
The simple fact that some guilds have other things to do is immaterial, and whining about it is the attitude of someone in a small guild who is not yet on the rotation, and wants to make sure that the big guilds always move slowly on the rotation so that they have a better shot of getting on the rotation. <br>

&quot;Wow, now who's trying to talk about credibility? &quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to bash your credibility with that, just telling you what it makes me personally think when I see a post that just flames instead of argue. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I see. My saying &quot;the rotation is so big that eventually people will get fed up with the wait, and go FFA on the mob&quot; is the same as saying 'Your hair is brown, you're wrong.' &quot; <br>
<br>
No, you saying &quot;Your previous totally unrelated posts means that you are wrong in this current post.&quot; is the same as saying &quot;your hair is brown, you're wrong.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I think i get it now though.  You're trying to win over Abaz, here i thought you were just trying to show the rathe community why a change in the sev rotation was needed.  But yea if you're just trying to come out on top of Abaz, you went about it the right way.  <br>
<br>
As for abaz, i dont know the guy or how he posts, but just cuz he uses words like bullshit and boohoo isn't a bad thing necessarily because he uses them to make a point (example, peopel who would complain about having guilds added in front of them are selfish and whinny, they should just suck it up and realize this is how things work.  Note:  I do not necessarily agree or disagree with this statement, its just an example of a point :P ).  He might come off as offensive but you CAN be offensive.  I don't notice him anywehre (and this is through skimming posts mind you, I hven't read an entire one as of yet so I may be wrong) attacking the people behind the presented opinions.  He didn't say You're wrong because you're whinny, so boohoo.  You on the otehr hand, did say something along these lines with that post of yours.  <br>
<br>
Anyway this is making the thread change directoin too much :P  I think the best idea on seb right now is the current one.  Even if what you propose, Rog, is &quot;fair,&quot; I can't see telling a warrior in my guild &quot;no sorry we got unlucky with sev spawning at bad times so now you gotta wait ANOTHER year before we can try killing him.&quot;  Fair or not, its not doable in my view.<br>
<br>
Or how about this... Assume you have this rotation setup... Guild C, Guild B, Guild A.  Guild A is up for the kill, followed by Guild B, followed by Guild C.  If a guild (guild A) fails to kill him twice, the mob becomes a race between the guild A and the following guild on the rot (guild B) for any and all subsequent spawns until guild A kills him.  ONly those two guilds can participate in the race (or even talk it out and decide on who will get him) as well as any guild trying to enter the rotation of course.  If guild B kills him they move ahead of guild A on the rotation and then teh mob is a race between guild A and guild C, (guild C being the one following next on the list.)  Same rules apply.  So in essence, if a guild is not really interested in sev, the rotation rotates aroudn that guild, but they never lose their spot.  Just a though, not sure how well this woudl work however.   <p>Juryiel Shadowangel&lt;br&gt;<br>

If guild A is up and loses a &quot;race&quot; once, then they know they HAVE to be ready the next week. If they are busy &quot;frying bigger (or different) fish&quot; perhaps they should think about scheduling the bigger fish around their rotation obligations.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I agree.  Rotation obligations should come first.  A guild up on rotation should try to kill the rotation mob as soon as it's capable.<br>
<br>
What about guilds that must wait until a certain time before they have a force capable of killing Sev?  Slissia had a good example:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Example: Sev spawns at 9 am on a weekday...I'm at work, so are most of my guildies...we do not have the force at that moment in time to take him, although we would within the 24 hours as we all come home from work. Guild Z has more folks on than we do, and kills mob before we manage to clock out and zip home. Okay, no problem, there's a next time. <br>
<br>
Next time Sev spawns at 8 am on a weekday. Again, other guilds looking to get on the rotation have a good 8 hours before I and my other guildies get home from work and get our happy little toons logged in. So Guild Y kills him before we can. <br>
<br>
With the 'two strikes' thing going, we would then have to wait another half a year, to hope and pray that Sev picks a more appropriate time of day (for us) to spawn. This seems to kinda penalize people who have no choice but to go out and work for a living.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Her example guild did everything right, and was forced to pass.  The example guild simply was forced to pass becuase it was a less mature guild.  (Note - less mature is being used to mean a small membership guild with the average level being low to mid 50s.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If 10 guilds enter all at once, the practicality of the rotation is destroyed because NO ONE can plan for their kill.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't understand this.  When the guild before you kills the rotation mob, I thought your guild was at that point on watch.<br>
Your guild is supposed to be on watch until you kill the rotation mob or pass.  How your guild sets up it's calendar and plans for killing a rotation mob is not the RTA's concern.  The RTA's job in this matter is to simply keep track of who's turn it is on the list and then inform the guilds participating on the rotation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roggulbuk>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The new Admin in Town</span><br>  Posts: 1051<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/6/02 1:05:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=887.topic&index=69>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rotation Rules?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
After reading all the pros and cons..and being one of those small guilds that must wait on the pleasure of the rot guilds, I have a equally small opinion on the matter.<br>
<br>
My opinion of no consequence is..status quo is ok. The guild leaders of the rotation guilds are nice honorable folks, and we are always patting ourselves on the back about how civilized we are to each other.<br>
<br>
I think everyone is presuming some evil intent where none was intended, or assuming some guild might decide to hold a rot on a semi permenent basis. I don't think either is true,..and from what I have heard so far we are only talking about a few weeks...not a year as implied in some posts.<br>
<br>
So unless this actually becomes a serious problem, why change the system. <br>

I dont frequent these boards because its not to my taste, however I felt the need to throw in my 2 cp on this thread.<br>
<br>
I know others have suggested this already, but allow me to do some simple math here and illustrate the dire situation this rotation is in.  There are currently 23 guilds on the rotation.  <br>
<br>
7*23 = 161  <br>
(spawn time * # of guilds on rotation)<br>
161/30 = 5.3666~ <br>
(no days between kills per guild / ave days in a month)<br>
<br>
This means every guild on the rotation will get one shot at Sev approximatly every 5 months assuming he spawns once every 7 days and he is killed the day he spawns.  Thats only 2 killings in any given year, and with other guilds joining the rotation so quickly, its only going to get worse.  I know its been suggested elsewhere in the thread, but perhaps it is time for Sev to go FFA or FCFS?  Again I really dont care what happens,  Just throwing out suggestions.<br>

I am in what you would call a small guild (approximately 40 members with about 25 members 50+) and allied with another guild.  We are not on any rotations, never even tried to take down Sev, but I try to watch the goings on here on the RTA because I believe the entire server's attitude and relationships revolve around the RTA and it's compromises/agreements more than anywhere/anything else.<br>
<br>
That being said, I would hope that the Sev rotation does not go FFA.  For I believe that this would lead to other mobs doing just the same and thus would start the downfall of the RTA and what it's managed to do in 3 years.  That is, to maintain an atmosphere of equity, fellowship, respect...<br>
<br>
Can you find this on any other server?  I doubt it.  Chaos is found on alot of other servers when it comes to what we call Rotation mobs.  Or control of those mobs by Uber guilds on those servers.<br>
<br>
While I had a belief that having a guild autopassed if they could not take down a mob on their Rotation turn, I find myself in a quandry because people have brought up the point that, like my guild/alliance, they may not have the capability to take down said mob if they were up on the Rot and the mob spawned at a bad time for them.  This would then force said guild/alliance to wait until their turn came around again, which may not be for 6 months or so.  Some guilds, like ours, might be force to pass due to not having the numbers when their turn comes around, but it would be their choice to do so, and not one of inconvenience.<br>
<br>
Will a situation arise in the future, similar to the one concerning LoM and CoN?  There is that possibility, but I hope that it doesn't.  Maybe it was a fluke, a strange occurrance, a rare chance for multiple guilds all within a few weeks time.  Lets not go off hastily and decide on something that can affect so many who might not know of these goingson.  Give some time, watch and see if it reoccurs in the near future.<br>
<br>
Now... I have a question concerning how getting onto a rotation happens, or for that matter, how not getting onto a rotation happens as well.  Situation is as follows:<br>
<br>
My guild does not have the numbers to take down Sev, nor do we with our Alliance... unless we make plans and everyone shows at said time and we get lucky with timing and with the fight... but since we don't have the numbers we call in people from other guilds (Example: My guild has 5 members, Alliance members are 4 more, we call in help and get 2 members from Circles End, 3 from Haven's End, 3 from Greyhaven... you get the gist, and we end up with 4 full groups 50+).  We manage to find Sev up and kill him with someone who needs the Scale winning the roll...  what constitues the rightness of this, the wrongness, how would it give you the ability of getting on the Rotation, or for that matter the lack of ability to get onto the Rotation?  What's to say a guild, if they had the numbers and were able to take down Sev without assistance, decided not to go onto the Rotation and kept to themselves that they killed Sev?<br>
<br>
