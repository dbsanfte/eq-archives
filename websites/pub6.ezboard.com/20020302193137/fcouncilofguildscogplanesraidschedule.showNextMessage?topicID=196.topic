We came, we saw, we kicked some pretty major ass.<br><br>Well, I got on a bit early and surprisingly enough the tells to me were quite small.  I think I only had about 15-20 before noon.  Of course they were almost all people trying to sign up early or see what time the raid was.  Folks, the times are posted and I dont take names till the sign in times.  Early tells aint going to help ya.  Heh.<br><br>Anyway, moving on.  Got to SRo about a few minutes before noon PST.  And lo and behold a lot of people were there.  So at 12pm PST I promptly began the attendence call.  And got spammed.  Heh.  Well, thats what I get for not having a management team.  Anyway, within 15 minutes I had about 55 people.  Thats a good 11 groups since on Hate raids we need to keep a slot open for the wizard to port.  Its also quite a bit more than I wanted to take, but oh well.  Unfortunatly the actual break down of classes was kind of strange.  <br><br>I had 1, yes 1, wizard show up.  Ummm...its kind of hard to go to Hate without wizards.  They're sorta important.  Still, another one showed up later and another person brought another wizard online for ports, although they didnt play it once they were there.  We were also somewhat short on tanks.  Well, backup tanks anyway.  But we hada bunch of rogues and a few rangers so it was good.  There were also 8 mages.  Which was a first for me.  I guess everyone heard about our taking the Magi last time.  Heh.  We also were short a puller.  We didnt have one.<br><br>Yes, at 12:30pm PST it seemed Zellex was a no-show.  Slacker.  Course, I didnt see him over the week to ask him to come..but those are just details right?  However, Gruz has pulled in Hate before and volunteered to be our puller.  Then, right as I was about to start sending groups up...who should log on...but Zellex!  Woohoo!  We now had 2 pullers.  I saw visions of non-stop pullnig ahead!<br><br>As is often the cast, however, we had some unexpected problems getting to camp.  It wasnt anyones fault this time, no one trained the camp for instance, it was just bad luck.  Zellex ended up dead but our 56 cleric camped so it was all good.  Until Zellex decided to check out to see how much damage Gruzznot did in ThurgB.  Yup, without any buffs or equipement the monk went to see if he could FD in under a second.  Alas he failed.  I bring this up, because if anyone ELSE tries this on one of my raids they'll be kicked out so fast they'll be able to report what happens when you go FTL.  I mean it, this delayed us a bit while we sent our highest remaining cleric to rez him.  Unfortunatly this meant breaking up Group 1 for a few minutes while we got a port there and gated back.  Still, I had to deposit the port stone part of the raid fees so I could move, so it sorta worked out.<br><br>The next major snafu was that a ranger, Shadowbreeze went LD in the last group to go up.  We did try waiting a good 10 miinutes for him(?) to log back on, but Shadowbreeze never did.  The clock was ticking and we couldnt safely start the rezes till all the groups were in camp, so we ported up without Shadowbreeze.  I'm sorry, but there is only so long we can wait.  I've marked Shadowbreeze for attendence preference for the next raid.  The final groups made it to camp without a problem, and rez's too a remarkbly short time.  And we were ready to roll by about 3pm PST.  This was a good hour and a half later than I wanted, but the unexpected happens sometimes.<br><br>One note.  During the port ups and CR I had a run in with a raider that wanted to help.  Unfortunatly this person was someone without FD.  Okay, I dont want to go through this again.  So, if anyone EVER again questions me once I've made a command decision, your gone.  Period.  Question the removal decision and your permanently banned from any future raids I run.  I dont have time to explain the dangers of CR without FD or the possibility of training the camp, or another group training you, etc.  I dont care how experienced you are at it, or how many times you've done it for other raids there.  I know my raid and the poeple on it.  If you dont trust me absolutely, I dont want you on the raid.  I dont have time to argue.  Not when I have 20 things to do at the same time.  So simply, if you agure your gone.  Sure, I dont mind people questioning me sometimes.  I dont claim to know everything.  However, when I make a decision I expect people to follow it.  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong and you can have a field day on the boards at my expense.  But I think my record speaks for itself.  But after a few minutes we sorted things out.<br><br>And so the pulls began.  And never really let up.  After a good hour and a half of this, we realized that with close to 60 people up there, we had tanks just getting in the way of each other.  So the decision was made to try splitting the raid.  We sent several groups south and set up a mini camp in the south corner.<br><br>Now this CAN work.  We actually made several nice pulls like this.  However.  People need to listen when we do this.  I saw many people running back and forth between camps.  We authorized 1 person to do this, and yet I kept seeing people passing me.  This is important.  Because right about then, Zellex accidently pulled a train.  This happens sometimes.  It ended up wiping out the south camp.  Unfortunatly with people running back and forth they came into aggro radius of the train, after it finished with the South camp they came over and wiped the West camp as well.  This is why you listen to your raid commander.  The next time this happens I will call the raid right then and there.  I had people telling me for 30 minutes after that we could've taken them.  Folks, there were 2 Sprite Golems that are unmezzable, and another 6 mobs, and our level 60 enchanter was the first casulty.  We were also short 3 groups that were at the South camp, many of whom died very quickly.  My main job is to assess the situation in times like this and make sure we dont get our asses kicked.  Fortunatly the clerics listened to the first camp call and they camped out.  <br><br>Now some strategy.  In situations like there there are very good reasons to camp the clerics first and keep everyone us standing up.  When the call for clerics to camp comes up, everyone else's job is to KEEP THE CLERICS ALIVE.  This means engaging individual mobs, sometimes on an individual basis.  Yes, you'll die and you'll probably die quickly.  But if you die giving that cleric the extra 5 seconds they need to camp we'll get things rolling again quickly.  If you simply panic or chicken out and camp we might not get ANY clerics camped and we'll all be dead.  So the call goes out for the clerics to camp, and then, only after they've camped do the rest of us camp.<br><br>Still, we camped 2 of our 3 56 clerics so it was, once again, all good.  Within 20 minutes we were back up and rolling.  This time as a single camp.  Heh.<br><br>And boy did we keep rolling.  From this point on, we never stopped.  The pulls were fairly constant.  There was only one loot snafu and that was over the Rogue BP that dropped.  One of the rogues had been killed and we were in the process of rezing him.  As it turns out, he won the lotto on it, but shortly before he could loot it, the person who came in second apparerntly looted it before him, thinking he was the one that had won it.  Okay, once again, No One Loots Without Express Permission from the Loot Master.  I dont care if you're afraid it'll rot.  I spent 20 minutes ironing things out after this.  I dont want to go through it again.  Loot isnt why were here, but its a touchy subject with a lot of people.  Its why I'm not listing who acually got the piece since I dont want people getting upset overwhat *might* have been an honest mistake.  Still, everyone did listen after this, even to the point of the only bard in the raid asking before he looted any bard stuff.  Same for the lone Iksar Shaman.  Thats how its supposed to go.<br><br>Other than that tho, things went very smoothly.  We quickly dispatched the mobs north and south of the camp and moved to the Maestro's house.  There we pretty quickly dispatched both the Hand and the Maestro himself.  Wussie wanna-be Phantom of the Opera boy.  The amazing thing is, I believe we took down the Hand with no casualties and the Maestro with perhaps one.  This was while we had several pulls between them.  That just rocked.<br><br>Now if anyone was getting the impression from the above that we had problems, far from it.  99% of the raid went so smoothly people probably didnt realize we HAD any problems.  And the ones we had were quickly smoothed over.  Amazing since by the time we'd taken the Maestro down we'd been going for over 8 hours.  Yes, we started at noon and killed the Maestro at around 8pm PST.  Woohoo!  And remarkably few people had left.  So we finished clearing out the area.  By just before 9pm PST we had CLEAR THE FIRST FLOOR!  Yes, once again, CoG totally cleared the First Floor of Hate!  Yes, I know many if not most guilds/alliances do this all the time and pretty quickly compared to us.  But they dont do with with 60 people, most of whom are below 52 from, in this case, 10 or so different guilds.  Thats teamwork.  And it doesnt always happen on CoG raids.  Congrats to all.<br><br>So by around 9pm PST we were ready for the Second Floor of Hate.  This is where things bogged down.  Now for those that dont know, the second floor has majorly uber drops.  Unfortunatly they're pretty rare.  Like perhaps 10 pieces of good loot on the entire floor with about 150 mobs that are at least twice as hard as the first floor mobs with crappy pathing.  And we have to do it with less people.  So I consider the second floor to simply be a bonus.  Unfortunatly this time the bonus round didnt yeild us much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  It DID, however, yield us a few nice pieces, AND we managed to rescuse a trapped SK.  This poor soul had been trapped up on the second floor LD for almost a week.  Because of how the second floor is, not a lot of people go there and he wasnt able to get out till we got there.  So while we might not have managed to get a lot of second floor loot, we saved someone who was trapped, and I think thats just as good.  We're all about having a good time and helping people.  And really, you dont get much more helpful than getting someone out of a plane.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Congrats to Zigzager of the Children of Virtue for finally making it out.<br><br>We did get a few good things on the second floor, I'll detail those in the loot list tho.  Now then, we continued to kick much butt on the second floor till about 11:45pm PST.  By this point we were down to about 35 people, no wizards for TL, and people who were getting very tired.  Also Zellex was making noises about calling the Last Pull.  We ALL know what happens when Zellex shouts Last Pull, so we called the raid then.  Heh.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We then divided up the gems by lottoing them.  There were 8 Blue Diamonds, 9 Diamonds, and 12 Black Sapphires.  Enough so that everyone who stayed got something.  We also had a bunch of jacinths left over.  Going to have to figure out something to do about that.  Perhaps make a bunch of resist jewelry and lotto that off...  <br><br>Reagent Users.  I believe I caught all of you.  However, if I didnt, please get in touch with me with any of your costs minus whatever cash items you might have gotten.  The CoG account isnt huge or bottomless, but we are able to make sure no one got shorted.  Its why these fee's are taken after all.<br><br>Special Note to those that managed to get this far. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Congrats to Gruz the Shadowknight for not only volunteering to pull, for not only staying to the end like so many, BUT for achieving his EPIC!  Yes, tonight we also helped a raider complete his Epic!  The last piece he needed was the decrepid Hide from a Ashborne Drake, and it dropped.  Although Gruz did not roll the highest for it, he did roll second highest and Vivitar who won, ceded the Hide to Gruz to complete his Epic.  Congratulations to both Gruz And Vivitar for being so generous to a fellow raider.  That is what CoG is all about.<br><br>Also, Congratulations to Odini for getting the very rare Essence of Vampire for his Epic!.  While the Shisshar is the main hold up on his epic, the Essense is almost as bad.  Also, congrats to Tedain who actually won the roll on the Essence, but traded the loot rights to the Enchanter BP that also dropped and let Odini loot the Essence.  Once again, this is what CoG is all about.  While I consider everyone equal in epic rolls and I dont care who is closer to completion than who, it is always nice when those who are in direct competiion with one another volunatarily give up their win to someone else who may be closer.  Congrats to all, you were all winners and I hope we can help others finish their epics in the future. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>For a raid that could have had so much go wrong.  For a raid that had a lot of expectations, we did very well.  We actually did a lot better than the last one.  As I said.  We had a few problems, but those were quickly ironed out.  For the most part, I hope, with no bad feelings.  We kicked ass, and got a ton of loot.  We wont be back for awhile, due to the rotation and I'll probably have to take a break for a week or two, but we will be back.  Hopefully to kick ass again.<br><br>Everyone who came should be proud of themselves.  We did what we did because we all worked together.  It isnt about leadership so much as teamwork, and we've all had jobs so we know as long as you have good teamwork you can even get around a terrible boss.  But no matter how good the boss is, without that teamwork nothing will ever get done.  You all did great, and I apologize for any ranting above.  It is somewhat necessary, but never forget that in the end everyone came together and worked together.  That is what CoG is all about.<br><br>Kellory Silverstar<br>KCoG Plane Raid Liason <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kellory>Kellory</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Unguilded Sexless Drood</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(9/30/01 11:12:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 9/29/01 Plane of Hate Recap!</span><hr size=1> And...As promised...the loot list!

No worries.  As I said, we finished the Maestro a little after 8pm PST I believe.  Thats a good 8 hours since the start.  Thats not really leaving early.  While I do want as many people to stay as possible, and the second floor is a lure <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , I dont hold it against those that least after putting in that kind of time.  You just miss out on possible loot later <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Its those that leave after an hour because of a bad break-in I have problems with...  Fortunatly I havent had any of those in a long time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We all rocked.<br><br>As for pets.  Frankly everyone on the raid is over level 46.  I expect everyone to know how to control their pets or their spells or aggro.  If that proves not to be the case, then sure feel free to talk to people or bring it to my attention.  I dont want to be telling anyone how to play their class.  While I know, and have played to high level, most types I dont claim to know the best way of doing anything.  I wouldnt even tell a fellow druid how to play his class.  We all find our own ways here and no single way is the best.  But if you do see people endangering others, feel free to point it out.  Please be polite tho (I believe you were <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) or else send me a tell (or two, sometimes they get missed in my chat spam) and I'll talk to them privately.  <br><br>But the thing is, everyone did great.  When I do these raids I trust people to know what they're doing.  I dont have the management team or time to watch over what individuals are doing.  And so far, I've yet to be disappointed by anyone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Congrats again to all.

I had a blast and the drops were amazing as well as the organization compared to other raids I've been in with CoK. I look forward to bringing ALOT more of CoM to the raid. <br><br>   On a side note , I was the one who wanted to assist with the CR after break in and I know that its risky for a druid to do this. I'm just very comfortable in the Plane of Hate. I was told not to and I complied after a brief discussion with Kellory. Sorry bro , was just trying to help. No biggie , was fun. Next time if I happen to offer my assistance for a CR , just slap my silly ass and say HELL NO!!! hehe , well thanks again for a wonderful raid. <br><br>                                                    Mechy Himeros<br>                                                    59 Druid <br>                                                    Circle of Mist<br>                                                    <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="Http://www.eqcircleofmist.homestead.com/COMmain.html">www.eqcircleofmist.homest...Mmain.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showPrevMessage?topicID=207.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showNextMessage?topicID=207.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.emailToFriend?topicID=207.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.threadControl?topicID=207.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="councilofguildsgeneral">General<option value="councilofguildscouncildiscussions">Council Discussions<option value="councilofguildsevents">Events<option value="councilofguildscogplanesraidschedule">CoG Planes Raid Schedule<option value="councilofguildsfrm8">CoG Dragon Raids<option value="councilofguildsguildwars">Guildwars<option value="councilofguildshelpitemswanted">KCoG Bazaar<option value="councilofguildsintroduceyourguild">Introduce Your Guild<option value="councilofguildsguildalliances">Guild Alliances</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule>CoG Planes Raid Schedule</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-freecouons&BL=print>PRINT FREE COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
