I will be buying the game ... <br>
<br>
If your looking for a game that can take up massive ammounts of your time , and not bore you to tears , this game is not what you're looking for. <br>
<br>
If your looking for a game that you can log on for shorter amounts of time period , and still feel like you got something accomplished then this might be something for you. <br>
<br>
If your looking for a game that you can solo in , look elsewhere . Even worse than EQ this game completely geared for grouping . There are ways to solo in this , but soloing is definately not the main thing , and you will take penalties for it , that in the over all outlook of the game , aren't worth it in my opinion . <br>
<br>
The Game is Broken down into 6 classes (at least in beta)<br>
<br>
Terran Enforcer : This is your Melee Hybrid . They Are the second best in Combat and Defense. Special Abilities of this class , are :  Hacking - The chance of disabling oponents Shields , Weapons , Engines or Reactors ...   Enrage - Taunt... and a couple of others , but those are the Two Main ones that stuck out for me .   The Enforcers Main Weapon systems are Missiles . <br>
<br>
Terran Trader: This is a Caster equivilant . Masters of Most Repair , and Trading . They recieve the Negotiate skill , which allows them to buy items from NPC Merchants and sell back to other NPC merchants for a Profit . They also recieve several repair skills which can be beneficial in groups . They also have the most Inventory space.  Their main weapons are Beam Weapons . <br>
<br>
Projen Warrior:  The Slowest of all the Classes , but also the most durable . They have access to all types of weapons in the game , and the best Shields .   Their Special Abilities include Reflect Shield (or something close) , which equates to a damage shield .  They also have an Auto Destruct shield , which while in the process of destroying you , and your friends , destroys the enemy as well . <br>
<br>
Projen Sentinel:  Stronger than the other Caster equivilant classes , but with a price. The Sentinel , are the Projen Prospectors , they get prospect skill which allows them to mine ore and materlials . They have the Benefit of the Projen warriors of having better shields , and better combat skills , but they like the speed and stealth that the other Caster classes would have.   They get a skill called powerdown - feign death . They also get a skill called jumpstart which is the equivilant of Rez<br>
<br>
<br>
Jenquei Defender:  Another Hybrid Class . I have a bias on this class , as it is my Favorite .  Not as strong as the Projen Warrior or Terran Enforcer when it comes to combat , but definately stronger than any Caster class.  The Jenquei get a unique ability of that allows them to summon NPC's . Unlike the Enforcers Enrage skill which is just a taunt that causes the NPC to attack . This skill actually has a good Chance to summon a NPC or Group of NPC's to Point Blank range.  They Also have the Ability to Cloak , Put up some Heavy Shields which can absorb alot of damage , and they have a fold space skill which allows them to extend range from the enemy , and eventually Teleport friends back to their last bind point. <br>
<br>
Jenquei Explorer: The Weakest of all the classes in regards to combat, however they are the best at avoiding conflict when they don't want it . They have access to Cloak , Navigate , WormHole , and Prospect Skills . The Prospect skill is the same as the Projens so they can prospect minerals and ore . Cloak is exactly that , the ability to hide , and eventually hide the entire group . Wormhole is the equivilant of Porting , however Porting does stand a chance of causing damage to items that are in your inventory . They also get a skill called jumpstart which is the equivilant of Rez<br>
<br>
<br>
Because of Beta Pwipes , I wasn't able to get any of my Characters past level 33 , so I don't know what the max level in the game is , I believe its somewhere around 150 or 200. <br>
<br>
The Leveling / Skill system is broken down in 4 different ways. <br>
<br>
Overall Level = Combat Level + Explore Level + Trade Level<br>
Combat Level = EXP and Levels Earned by Fighting or Doing QUest that are Combat Related or Warrior Faction related<br>
<br>
Explore Level = EXP and Levels Earned by visiting points in the Different Sectors and Solar Systems that You haven't been to before . Prospecting Ore or Minerals, and Quest that Involve <br>
Exploring or Explorer Faction<br>
<br>
Trade Level = EXP and Levels Earned by selling your Phat Lewts that you don't want and don't really care about to NPC Merchants , or Doing quests that are Trade or Trade Faction. <br>
<br>
<br>
Each of these are Important , because your skills are based on these , and whether or not you can upgrade certain skills, as each skill as Certain Level Requirements before you can improve that skill again .  This Level requirement can change between One of the Sub Levels , and your Overall Level . <br>
<br>
Each Time you level you gain 1 skill point . Regardless of what type of EXP you got the skill point on , a skill point is a skill point , and can be used to upgrade any skill so long as you are of the appropriate level , and have enough skill points. <br>
<br>
Of course by default you start with some skills . And you gain your other skills by either questing for them or Paying for them at the appropriate level . When you initially gain the skill , you do not need to spend a skill point . However to raise the skill from there , you must. <br>
<br>
Each Level of skill is cumulative of the last. So to raise from Level 1 to Level 2 skill you need 1 point . From Level 2 to level 3 , you need 2 points . etc. <br>
<br>
The Main issue that exists with this type of system is that , You can only Epxlore so much , unless you are a Sentinel , or Explorer . <br>
<br>
Whenever you Die , you recieve an EXP penalty . Prior to one of the last patches . If you recieved a Jumpstart this EXP penalty was practically negated , because you didn't have to have the station at which you are bound come 'Tow&quot; you back.  This was changed , and Jumpstart now relieves only a little bit of the exp penalty , with that ammount going up as the Jumpstart level raises . <br>
<br>
And herein lies the issue , that you cannot determine what type of EXP your EXP penalty comes from . So during the lower levels , if you have an EXP penalty . You are loosing massive ammounts of Exploring EXP for your Exploring Level , repaying that debt.   <br>
<br>
If you play a class that can actually do combat somewhat decently you can easily recover from the EXP Penalty by fighting, however if you can't fight well , your going to be hurting to get rid of the exp penalty without burning to much of your Explore EXP on it. <br>
<br>
Whether or not this made Live I don't know yet , cause I haven't picked up the game , however the game did have an EXP Penalty forgiveness system . Each day that you were logged off the game , a certain ammount of EXP was forgiven. <br>
<br>
It was not uncommon for me to see chat scroll across my screen indicating that people wouldn't be on for the next couple of days because they had a 45k exp Penalty. <br>
<br>
<br>
Again I will be picking up a copy of this game . It makes for a quick time passer for an hour or so when you have absolutely nothing better to do , yet you don't have the time to log into EQ and Camp something. <br>

I'm hopefully picking up my copy today and am playing in Orion.<br>
<br>
Got in the final phase of beta and love the fact I can just log in for 20min to do a couple of trade runs rather than having to wait an hour to find a group, group for 3 hours, then log off.<br>

You don't seem to have the requirement of spending a ton of time playing when you can spend a few minutes. <p><HTML><BODY><center>
