<br>
Staging Strategy :<br>
<br>
Attendance will be taken at 5pm PST / 8pm EST. If it falls on a weekend it will be at - 3pm PST / 6pm EST. Attendance stops half an hour after that time at the lavastorm ring. Pls be off anon or roleplay and put an LFG tag on for ease of identification. If you will be late be sure to inform us or post it here or your space will probably be filled by the time you get there. This in no means discourages latecomers, it encourages people to camp at the ring. (so camp at the ring <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       ) Durring attendance pls refrain from drinking or emote spamming. All it does is makes our job harder which means raid goes on longer which means you're up later, so dont do it.<br>
<br>
Resists will be a minimum 70 fire and magic unbuffed.<br>
<br>
Attendance fee is 50pp each to go to enches and clerics for stones. When you enter the group pls give the money to your group leader. Only enches and clerics are exempt from the fee. (correct me if I'm wrong but I dont think any other buffing class requires a reagent)<br>
<br>
As soon as groups are assembled we will start moving into Sol 2 groups at a time and will start staging from the spider room thingy (I didn't hunt there much) with the stone guy in the web, room. Muji has graciously volunteered to pull for us where needed if he is available that night. We will then make our way to the dragon head room for buff line.<br>
<br>
All rolls are based on previous SB rules.<br>
<br>
At this time all pallies will roll for the Book in case it drops. For safety sake the top 3 numbers will be remembered. In the dragon head room buff line will be done and we will then proceed to camp out to a chat room called - Naggy Karana. All casters and healers WILL bind on the staircase behind this room.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nagafen Strategy :<br>
<br>
Reform groups as quickly as possible upon return. We dont want buffs wearing off so this part will go fast. Mages are to use Fire pets. Other pet classes if you can find someone to throw a FR resist on your pet it may help.<br>
<br>
Triage (healing) line will be held in the buff room in a U shape around the mouth ent to his cave for optimum efficiency. Healers are allowed to sacrifice a bit of fire resist in favor of wisdom but try and keep your FR as high as you still can in case. Healers being Shamans, Clerics and Druids. If there are several druids then those over 50 become nukers. This will be said in advance to prep your correct spells.<br>
<br>
When the attack command is called 2 groups of tanks will run in and get to the back of his room to get him back there. 10 seconds (or as fast as I can type) after that the rest will go in. REASON - so that not all tanks are running back for a heal at the same time simultaneously overloading the healers and pulling Naggy to the front.<br>
<br>
Tanks with Taunt are to taunt until he hits you, soon as he does take 1 step back and if you have to, go heal up but be SURE he is not on you when you leave.<br>
<br>
After the rest of the tanks rush in, count to 15 and send all pets in, this should spread the tanks and pets out evenly so he is always being hit. Casters stay to the walls to leave room for the tanks to go heal.<br>
<br>
At about 45% life all casters will rush. (hint - fire based spells do nothing so use ice or if you have to then magic based) All mages will Malosi like crazy and whoever lands call it. NOTE **You must be standing UNDER him for a spell to land. He and his sister resist by distance so the closer you are the better chance you have. If you die, mem only your dmg spell and run back in. I realize lev is important but by that point there is no time left for it.<br>
<br>
At this point if all goes well Naggy should fall to our amassed might and we will be able to distribute his prizes for us. Exp group looter will tell the lootmaster of all items and then let loot master deal with it from there.<br>
<br>
Aftermath :<br>
<br>
Do not deny a rez, thats a quick way to not get invited back again. As soon as rezzes are complete and not 1 minute before, all lotto's will be done. All rolls are based on previous SB rules. it is a random roll of 1 200. Dont practice rolls or roll twice, its rude, needless and I dont put up with it. (yes I can be a pain but none of us should have to listen to you spout off) If you roll wrong, roll again properly.<br>
<br>
*NOTES*<br>
<br>
I dont think I need to go over etiquet with you guys but we'll be brief about it anyway. Do not swear, emote spam, practice roll or make lewd comments. As some of you may have gathered I am very much against all of those and will be using the baseball method if I see or hear it. I believe 3 chances is more than enough to clean up behavior. If all 3 chances are used up you can be replaced on this raid. Next raid you can try again. Simple.<br>
<br>
We are going for 8 groups of attackers, 48 people. I would like to have 1 extra group of 53+ ers who can volunteer for buff line. (Clerics, Enches, Druids, Shamans, etc.) They WILL be allowed to lotto since they used their mana for the cause and to deny them would be truly unjust. Just because dragons cap at 52 doesn't mean we cant find a way to include everyone possible.<br>

I hope all will go well for you and FoF and everyone at the raid! <p><HR>
<font size=2>An Alliance is...."in interguild relations, a formal agreement between two or more guilds for mutual support in case of war. An alliance provides for combined action on the part of two or more independent states and is usually defensive in form, since it obligates allies to join forces if one or more of them is attacked by another guild. Alliances are typically defined by a treaty, the most critical clauses of which are those that define the casus foederis, or the circumstances under which an ally becomes obligated to aid a fellow ally..." The Council of Guilds is not an alliance. Basta.</font>

<br>
Now the question.  I once asked Haemish about Shaman attending the Dragon raids.  At the time, the level required was 40 and if on the healing line the Fire/Cold resist could be neglected (not waived, just not a hard low limit of 70).  Is this still the case, and will it be the case in the future?<br>
<br>
I am close to 40 (39 with 2 yellows full) and I am starting to seriously work on resist gear.  Just wanted to be sure what to get.<br>

Thanks. <p><hr>

yep, you can sacrifice fr for wisdom as a healer but try not to go too low, lets say a minimum 45 fr unbuffed.<br>

<br>
First:  With the 50pp...is that 50pp for both an enchanter AND cleric (100pp total) or 50pp total?  I'm guessing the later, but the wording on that could be taken both ways...just wondering for clarity so i don't show up to a raid with too little.<br>
<br>
Second:  With mage pets...why are they using fire and not water pets for Naggy...wouldn't he resist the damage spell that the pets cast?  I know there's other variables to consider with pets...just curious<br>
<br>
Plan sounds good...never been on a dragon raid before...and i'm going to have to pass up Naggy this round (gonna be out of town by the time he shows up =\...sorry for the inconvenience).  Whoop that wurm for me...I'll be ready for Vox! <p>Good Journies,<BR>

<br>
The 50pp is flat for everyone. Clerics and enches alike along with everyone else hand in a 50pp fee. The only people getting money back are those that use stones. No one should be paid to go on the raid in my opinion so if you use a component you get reimbursed for it.<br>
<br>
As for pets, the reason for using the fire pet is because they have an incredibly high FR. This makes it so that every time Naggy uses his AE fire attack they don't die. They also put out the most dmg overall making them the best choice since rooting is unnecessary, stunning is always resisted and the likely hood of being hit is minimal so their lower life is of no concequence.<br>
<br>
Questions are always good, I would rather have someone ask than not know and have something bungle up.<br>

It is well worth the read and gives great advice on what to expect and how to handle yourself. Well if you've been on this sort of raid before then you probably know most of the stuff but if your new like me check it out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
