The fog clouds roll out of the underground, as I stand in front of the door, letting the pulse of sound roll over my back, encompass me and then move into the street. Technically I am violating the noise ordinance by opening the back door for no reason, but the police have been by already tonight, and they won't come back at five am. I feel as if I could sit down against the pressure of the voluminous clouds that push against my back, sit in them as if they were an easy chair carved from human humidity and heated by the steady, rhythmic breathing of two thousand people. I could fall back against the sound and the sweat, and be lifted on it. I stood away from the door, almost in the street. Had I been paying attention, I could have stopped anyone from going in behind me. But I wasn’t paying attention. Tonight didn’t matter; the overwhelming force of the crowd inside had pushed me outside, seeking relief and solitude. The empty street was enough. <br>
<br>
We were running under capacity, the bitter cold and ice storm that had covered the early evening the night before kept all but the most serious ravers away. There would be no fights tonight, no shoving matches between drunks from downtown. No, this was the culture of the rave that I liked. The music was almost enough of an intoxicant, almost, for the people in the building. Whatever they were doing, these would be the ones to be calm. Even at five am it was still purely night, in the middle of December. This far above the equator, a December night starts at 4pm and ends at 7am. They could be left alone, inside, until daylight was actually bearing down on the door. <br>
<br>
It hung open being me on the hinges, people walking out slowly, often stopping and going back in for a short time. I may have let people in without knowing, I may have let people in for free. Tonight, though, no one would care. Five am, barely two thousand real count, no matter what happened, it would be a slow night. <br>
<br>
The music would shift and change, just as I would tune out one throbbing beat, another would whirl up to assault me. I’d taken out the earplugs for the night, our DJ’s lowered the volume after 4am, to bring the night down a notch, and to introduce sounds they believed best played as quietly as they’d ever get. <br>
<br>
I often wonder where I was on those nights, the nights when I’d consider tilting myself backwards into a cloud of steam and mist, recline and lose myself in the murk and damp of human sweat, and be swept away by it. I often wonder if I’ve ever come back from that. Would ever the all too frivolous afterbirth of a rave like this ever hold comfort for me? The huddle of ravers leaving at nine in the morning, tired and sore, cold, almost purple sometimes from the dawn’s chill. Where was I on those nights that I would walk ten feet away from the back door and feel like I was standing on another planet, looking up at the same starts and dreaming of a sound filled life, a pulse that no one else could feel. <br>
<br>
Picture Elvis (Moist)<br>
<br>
She reads through the book, <br>
Measures her picture there. <br>
Picks up a knife, <br>
Cuts it to wallet size…<br>
<br>
Now she has lived, <br>
Now she has breathed<br>
Now she’s tasted heaven but the trip doesn’t stay<br>
And all she wanted was a photograph.<br>
<br>
Rain on my tongue feels like I’m tasting God. <br>
Silver and Gold, drinking the riches up<br>
My back to the night, and if I died,<br>
I’m going to taste forgiveness on the other side<br>
<br>
All she wanted was a photograph<br>
<br>
Mask of the city hangs in mock deliberation<br>
Step outside the wire while the sun strips off my cocaine<br>
Baying like a banshee, oh my cup is overflowing;<br>
Another brutal ending, they say, don’t want any more story telling<br>
<br>
She reads through the book<br>
Said that she never knew<br>
The question is easy; the answer is hard to take<br>
The bindings crack, the words will fade,<br>
But she keeps the picture in the frame that she made<br>
<br>
And all she wanted was a photograph<br>
All she wanted was a photograph.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The coals blacken as I watch the fire die, I know they will cool if I let them, if I left them. <br>
I stir them with the end of the poker, <br>
splitting them to their red centers, sparks dancing. <br>
I make a bed of the hottest -coals, <br>
and frame it with the burned husks of two… <br>
dead lengths of wood. I catch some kindling in the ashes, in the new flames-<br>
They catch, spark, writhe in motionless, silent agony. <br>
Over this bed of burning wood, a full foot thick block of cut wood. The sides burn as the underneath is scored away by flame, carving the middle like a forgotten canoe. <br>
<br>
It will lay there, on the top of the bed of fire and ashes, coals and heat, until the only combustible left is itself. The sides will keep the top burning, and <br>
the bottom will keep the sides burning, until it settles, and puts itself out. <br>
<br>
Hollowed out and blackened, tomorrow, the ashes will be cooled, <br>
black to the core, carbon and soot. <br>
Rather burn red and twist into sparks, <br>
Than lie in the darkness, collapsed and fallen in on myself, burnt through the center, pierced by the dancing lights and popping in the veins. <br>
<br>
Soon the time of year, will be of sleepy looking hamlet houses, <br>
Suburbia denied by the low hanging chimney smoke, white from the pellet stoves, <br>
barbecue stoves that light with electric switch, dimmer slide, to make the flames<br>
rise. <br>
<br>
Break the middle, and be under the collapsing weight,<br>
Pushed to the ground, eternally, <br>
Flames licking at that strong center already, <br>
Tasting but wishing they could bite, as they lick all hope away. <br>
<br>
<br>
She is still there<br>
                                                             Hidden. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cleverly hiding from me,<br>
Right under, &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp left under,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My flesh, <br>
<br>
Breathing into my ear, whispering love and <br>
hope and happiness as her breasts swell against the inside of my chest, <br>
pressure on my heart <br>
to stop the beating, stop the violent beating. <br>
<br>
Her fingers and hands still hold tightly to my bones, curled, <br>
<br>
again as the ivy, <br>
<br>
again as the oak, <br>
<br>
into patterns mysterious that could be<br>
<br>
The Good Lord if only he would speak through her, and answer my unanswerable questions,<br>
The transcendent quality of being dea(alive)d, and not caring that neither nor isn’t<br>
Always open to finding another. <br>
<br>
<br>
Already the coals falter, fault her, <br>
<br>
As they have spilt away from the solid form, and broken themselves,<br>
burn up trying to find a way to be again what they never were. <br>
<br>
<br>
Cleverly hiding from me. <br>

You capture the imagination of the reader and bring your reader into the setting, there are few who can do this on <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">this</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> level.<br>
<br>
Reading these things always makes me think of those moments inside moments that you have to yourself to ponder sometimes the smallest of things, sometimes the largest of things, and sometimes, nothing.<br>
<br>
There is a part of your soul in them, and thats what makes it connect with your reader's souls. We all can see/feel something in your writing that evokes emotions/memories that often we try to subdue. <br>
<br>
It's a pure and wonderful experience reading these. Thought provoking would be an understatement, and I look forward to your next work.<br>

<br>
If you want some criticism I can provide that. I can tell there aren't many members of MENSA reading these boards. <br>
<br>
All I have to say really is that it seemed to me after reading it that you started with sort of a short story format and by the end you merged it with what seemed to be verse or poetry.<br>
<br>
I wonder if that was your intention from the start? Or, are there two distinct works posted?<br>
<br>
You did a great job with setting the environment, excellent use of adjective. I guess that after leading in so wonderfully it seems like a story is promised but never delivered.<br>
<br>
But like I said, you don't have to listen it's just some guy who really has no clue and enjoys antagonizing others.<br>

<br>
Wow, hey <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Yeah, I did start with the intention of a short (though longer than what I posted) story. As often happens with me, a song came on as I was writing that caught my attention (Picture Elvis, by Moist) and I wrote it in to use as a pivot point in what I was writing. <br>
<br>
After it, I couldn't really find my original direction again, and went off in an alternate direction. I'd agree with the assessment that there are two differant works in that, for sure, though not my intention from the beginning. <br>
<br>
I almost never have a problem getting something started, but I find I falter at a very short length, even when there is more that I'd like to include, it just doesn't seem to flow for me after 500-2500 words, depending on what I'm doing. <br>
<br>
I don't mind pickin each other apart on the flame boards, we both do it quite well *grin*. <br>
<br>
Thank you for the reply Grullin, I appreciate the thought you put into it. <br>

Yours,<br>

<br>
Then at some point take several of them and find a story line to string them together, and then re-edit.<br>
<br>
hehehe now I will take my dumb suggestion back to my study, where I have lots of stuff I don't have the guts to post.<br>

<br>
My advice is to write whatever, however, and in whichever format you like.<br>
<br>
Writing is the most personal and soul searching thing you can do.  You find out quite alot about yourself and your thinking when you try to compose a story or poem.<br>
<br>
In my experience as a writer, it is vastly more important what you get out of writing it, then what a reader gets out of reading it.  Write for yourself and if other people like it..it's a bonus  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
