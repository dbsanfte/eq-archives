<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  My take on EQ</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
EQ... undisputedly a fun and enjoyable game, and a great way to spend that spare or 'inbetween' time during the day. All the time I'd spend watching tv or getting into trouble I now spend trolling messageboards and playing EQ. I've met many good people, and have done many amazing things that I could only dream about doing. EQ is a fantasy world full of interesting and diverse people. It's the game that makes the world, but the people that make the game. This is EQ's success. Their motto is, &quot;You're in our world now...&quot; and that's true. But just putting me in their world wouldn't be much of a game without all the amazing people, guilds, events, and raids. I enjoy every bit of it. If I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't play. I have nothing really to complain about with EQ. EQ is what it is, and I knock on wood everyday that in the summer of 00 I went to EB and chose it over AC and UO when I was looking for a long term adventure. I found exactly what I was looking for, and it's been a great ride. When will this ride end? I don't know... do I want it to end? Nope. If something better comes along will I get it? Maybe... If I get something better will I scrap EQ? Hell no...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Poor in game antics</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The obsession that Everquest creates in us sometimes leads a select few of us to do things that are not moral, ethical, or 'nice'. This can be seen in RL too. Behind those polygon models are humans, real honest to goodness humans who are falable in every way that anyone else is. People break the law everyday, abuse each other, backstab each other, quarrel, lie, cheat, steal, KILL, and at the very least manage to tick each other off. This is normal human behavior, as sad as I am to admit it... The only thing that can be done about it is to let others know of bad deeds done, and try to lead by example. If someone does something bad to you, don't retaliate by stooping to their level. Be the bigger person, be uber, have the balls and control to be good and honest. Sure, you can sit back and say, &quot;It's only a game, I'm going to ninja loot this l33t item and then go stomp on some newbie for not knowing the game well enough.&quot; But if you have that attitude then you're missing the point, and I'm not going to waste my time explaining it to you. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Complainers about EQ</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
For those who can sit back and say that EQ has a poor design, it sucks, the expansions are worthless, and that it's graphics are the worst on the market, all I can do is laugh at that. Nothing personal, but all you have to do is look at obvious facts. First off, EQ has over 300,000 subscribers. No other online game boasts numbers like that... Asheron's Call has less than half that many players (last time I checked). Second off, look how many people play endless DAYS (not hours, days) in order to either level up one or more characters or to work on getting valuable and helpful items. But, if that's not good enough for you, look at how many people will spend DAYS of their lives to help other people do just that. EQ's graphics are far superior to that of any other MMORPG on the market right now (although that may change soon) and has been so for 2 years running.  [edit] I forgot to finish this thought! LOL!! Anyway, if you think that camping sucks, quests are retarded, and that everyone should have a fungi tunic, epic, and phat lewtz at level 1 then you've got a problem. I would be just as happy playing this game with NO gear at all. It's not about gear, and if you think it is then YOU have a problem. Should everyone in RL have a personal jet, mansion, the newest $200 nike sneakers, a wardrobe of $5,000 suits, and season tickets to the Lakers? People have a problem today with material worries. It's always me me me, mine mine mine, and if I don't have something I don't need but I still want I'm going to whine about it. RL nor EQ is about material possessions, and if it is then once again, you've missed the point entirely.[/edit]</font><P><CENTER><A HREF="http://elementsofpower.20m.com" TARGET="_top"><IMG SRC="http://students.hamilton.edu/2002/bschulte/eqpics/newestsig.gif" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=110 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom></A></CENTER><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubicrius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bicrius</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=35101068&img=5 BORDER=0> at: 5/5/01 6:47:50 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#F5F5DC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulorrux.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lorrux</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>175</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>5/5/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>7:02:10 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: My take</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">/agree with Bic<br>
<br>
I hold my tongue when trying to complin about EQ cause hello I've been playing it for well over a year now, others nearing 3 years. It's easy to point out flaws in a game this size, but for me personally there are an extraordinary number of things in EQ which are great. I agree Verant gets heavy handed in response to player tactics evolving further than Verant intended, but in my mind it has never stopped players/guilds from adapting to the new ways. Uber mobs still are dropping after the Cleric breastplate nerfs and so forth to name one example. *sidenote: didn't Furor threaten to quit around that time also* <br>
<br>
I personally like the fact that Verant has to patch cause the users of their products are alot smarter than they thought and abuse their product/mobs. Realistically, how boring would the game be now if they had stuck to their original plans without developing the Planes, Kunark, Velious and so forth. Many of us would have quit awhile ago. So I have to cut Verant slack on that one cause the customers always have a thirst for new products, and if they hastingly put stuff in game that doesn't work as it should I can slap them on the wrist and let them try to fix it. I think most of us take this gameworld for granted like things we may take for granted in RL. Not understanding game programming I'm still sure it tooks lots of manpower and hours to get to the point we are at. *hey Absor, gimme back my keyboard* Man, I must be drunk taking up for Verant like this. At this point I'm not sure if Verant has the resources to try some of their ideas before putting them into game but I guess their rationale is we have 300K people who we can try this on, and if we screw up oh well, a patchin' we shall go.<br>
<br>
To sum things up, I probably give my overall gaming experience a B- so far. Obviously they have provided a great game for me to get lost in, but they still need to strive to be more efficient in their quality and delivery.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#CCCCCC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulieah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lieah</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=70896971&img=5 BORDER=0></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>714</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>5/7/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>6:04:47 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: My take</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I'll start off by saying I still love this game else I wouldn't have been playing it for over 2 years.

<br>
This guy has it all wrong and I'll tell ya why.  His whole reason for his not liking EQ is because of kill stealing.  Kill stealing doesn't even come close to the real problem issues in this game.  I was talking to Trystwich and several others about this last night.  The problem with the game doesn't start till 51.  There are two big huge things wrong with the game that could easily be fixed if they'd pull their heads far enough out of their asses. <br>
<br>
#1. Apparently Verant has it in thier heads that classes are somehow balanced.  Well they are in no way anywhere near balanced, AT ALL.  If classes were balanced you wouldn't REQUIRE an Enchanter, Cleric, and Evacer for everwhere you go but Karnor's Castle post 50.  A necro would actually have some use after 51 besides summoning corpses and pumping mana. A group of 6 warriors should be able to do the same damage, perhaps with a small amount of downtime as a &quot;balanced&quot; group of a cleric chanter evacer 2 tanks and a wizard type.  Warriors IMO should have twice the HP/AC they do currently.  As it stands right now Warriors have a mere 300hp more than a Paladin or SK.  How is this an advantage over having spells??? 300hp disappear in one round sometimes.  I have 300 hp less than a Paladin or SK as a Ranger, and almost as much AC.  <br>
<br>
While I admit the game should be somewhat difficult after 50, but not so time consuming as to sit for 3 hrs pulling your hair out trying to find that REQUIRED chanter when you have a good balanced group of 5 ready to go, only to have them all get impatient leave when you finally get one.  It would probably work out better if every one of those 5 people worked to find one but some people are too lazy to bother and expect someone else to do all the work for them. Thats another thing I hate, lazy people that complain about not finding groups, sitting around LFG when they could be WORKING with others to form one.<br>
<br>
#2. World size vs # of portals.  This is probably the #1 cause of the fantastic time sink in this game.   The problem may not be finding the people you need to hunt a certain dungeon.  The problem is actually getting them all in one spot w/o going through all kinds of hell.  One portal in Kunark just DOESN'T CUT IT.   Sorry 3 more bind spots wont make up for it Verant.  For instance, I had a group of 5 ready to go into Howling Stones yesterday but we ran into a snag, our Cleric was stuck way the hell over in Trakanon by Seb, and of course the only way to get there is to port to DL, run all the way to Karnor and Evacuate to EJ, then run all the way to Sebillis and get the person, port to DL run all the way to OT from there or port from Karnors to Skyfire (same distance).  What kind of sick minded idea did Verant have here? Why not just make a portal spell to EJ and Skyfire?  I have no idea why they did this and my only conclusion could be that they have never played the game before, either that or they are some pretty sick and sadistic jerks.  Do they expect us to spend one day rounding people to one spot, camp for the night and start the next day?  I mean what the hell? It doesn't work that way.<br>
<br>
Well, another view is that the 51+ game was intended for people with at least 12 hrs of playtime per day on their hands.  Its obvious.  I sure hope the next game takes these things into consideration.<br>
<br>
This guy in the review has no idea.</font><P><center><a href="http://www.silentsentinels.com"><img src="http://www.vanitey.com/profile2sig.jpg" border=0 align=bottom></a></center><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#F5F5DC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufayenae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fayenae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>273</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>5/7/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>8:06:06 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Community Supporter</FONT><BR></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: My take</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Lieah, I read it 3 times.<br>

I hate the time sinks in EQ as well.  In the old world there seem to be a set of druid stones in every zone. I remember thinking why in the heck can't they make all of those active. (especially the one by Kelethin).  I would say if VI really wanted to eliminate a lot of stress on thier customers they would make travel a lot easier.<br>
<br>
IMHO, there should not be a portal any farther than once zone away from anyhere.  This would cut group and CR times to nil and none.  I am not saying anymore classes should get ports, just make more of them.</font><P>Fayenae <BR>

I'm always bitching about picking people up at the Seb nipple.  People stay bound there to save themselves time, but expect druids to run 20 min everytime they need to go somewhere. *sigh*<br>
<br>
I hate hate HATE picking people up anywhere in Kunark except for the ring in DL.<br>
<br>
At least they did it right in Velious for the most part, cept for Wuoshi.<br>
<br>
About the topic, it never ceases to amaze me how much people complain about EQ.  The old message boards were filled 24/7 with people bitching about how much they hated the game, hated Verant, and wanted them to change everything.<br>
<br>
It's obvious that VI has done a LOT of things right in order to get this far.  VI Grosses $3,500,000 a month just from the subscription, no one is forced to pay them.  Personally, I'm paying $20 of that $3.5 mil.  Even though it appears as though 1/2 of the active EQ players hate the game, they keep playing, and keep paying.<br>
<br>
Honestly, EQ is what you make of it.  <br>
<br>
If you want to solo all day and relax, you can do it.  <br>
<br>
If you hate your Magician, you can start another char.<br>
<br>
If you hate camping, then don't do it.<br>
<br>
If you don't like twinking, then don't twink.<br>
<br>
If you hate having to kill hard stuff for your epic, then don't do it.<br>
<br>
If you hate the planes, don't go.<br>
<br>
You don't have to have uber stuff to be successful in this game.<br>
<br>
VI doesn't tell you that you need uber equipment.  VI doesn't force you to camp rare spawns.  The players choose to do these things in order to advance themselves or their friends.  But everyone always talks about how VI &quot;makes&quot; them do these things.<br>

As for the article.  I have always found that being courteous to others no matter what level you are will bring you good fortunes somewhere along the road.  It is sad that there are some a$$holes in game.  Most of the time I just stay clear and try not to become a target for them.<br>
