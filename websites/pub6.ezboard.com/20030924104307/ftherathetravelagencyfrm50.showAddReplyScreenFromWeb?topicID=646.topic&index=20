These are from personal experience (or told to me by the people invlolved), some were sorted out like adults and we now get along fine. Guilds will not be named because this is not the flame board.<br>
<br>
1. Ubah_Guild_00* (could be any of them) - Come join our guild we need more clerics. We wil give you your epic, (insert list of current hard to get spells) and such and such other ubah_items. <br>
       Is this what you mean by wait a year till we can do it ourselves? So you guys can poach more players to zerg through zones?<br>
<br>
2. Ubah_Guild_001 Enchanter In need of a shard for VT - He trains us who are holding the camp to try and get rid of us (no chat beforehand) His train dreails on himself and the we  save him. His thanks is to then try and train us again, same result, we  asked him wtf he is doing (insert shard remark here). We say just sit here we see them drop fairly commonly and we dont need them so you can loot it, he then tries to ks us. <br>
       The  fact that a lvl 60 enchanter (pre pop) could not do any of these things succesfully nor mezz the 4 mobs he was training when it went wrong  speaks loudly for the skill of such a guild. When I spoke to a friend in said guild he said this guy has a rep in the guild for that and nothing would be done about it. Enchanters attitude was I need this to go here so you people in a lesser guild  have to leave so I can get what I want. Sounds familiar? <br>
<br>
3. Ubah_Guild_002 - Members (all lvl 60 or near) ksing  people in The Hole and then proceeding to wipe (zerg one could say) every mob they could find so the xp grp there had nothing to kill and thus no xp. When asked in tells their response was we are bored.<br>
        These are the people already in said zones and your worried about us going there? I Talked to an officer in that guild he sorted it but would he if I had not known him for  a fair while? I doubt it from other things said.<br>
<br>
4. Ubah_Guild_003 Paladin - Working on his faction for a zone trains people xping. His statement as gate was casting was &quot;thought you could use these&quot; <br>
        Seeing as  the duo were already engaged in a melee  and this was said in say (very easy to miss with battle spam and after he had trained us) it is very hard to see this as a kind and thoughtful act more of a you are killing mobs I need for faction. You are worried about us training a graveyard?<br>
<br>
5. Ubah_Guild_004 Member - I turn up at a pop camp fully spawned, only one other person in the zone and I know where they hunt pretty much every night and they are not around this camp. I proceed to start killing, after about 15 mins this person turns up and pulls 2 mobs from my camp I go and get one  back and I get tells I am camping these. I reply No you were not in the zone when I arrived and the camp was spawned so obviously you weren't here before me. He replies yes i was  I just went and played another toon for a while but I'm back now. I ask so is this another case of Ubah_Guild_004 wanting a camp so everyone else  has to leave. His response was if you want to see it that way yes.<br>
        Have since sorted this one out with this person and he's a nice guy but the attitude of  I am in Ubah_Guild_00*  you can just piss off was there at the start. Same attitude as Ubah_Guild_001  Enchanter.<br>
<br>
6. Ubah_Guild_005 attempting AD had that many people in the zone no one else could play there because of lag (would that be zerging) <br>
          This is one of the things you guys are saying will happen to you if others gain access to HoH, yet did you guys show courtesy and leave the zone to try again later when so many people not in Ubah_Guild_005 were complaining about the lag? No.  When CB and VoLS attempted AD no such complaints where made.. if they had more people there than you why wasnt the lag worse?<br>
<br>
Do we complain to Ubah_Guildler_00* - I see your posts here that  my guildies dont do that (news for you guys they DO) or if they do tell us we will deal with it.<br>
Why bother see point 2 and point 7.<br>
<br>
7. Ubah_Guild_006 Guildleader Whilst defendng  one of his members as a notorious trainer - Something along the lines of this;<br>
If your not in my guild you obviously cant play your toon and were not worthy  of consideration.<br>
      Whilst it might not be fair to paint all members of a guild because of the actions of one member, the guild leader tarnishing his is another matter when he publicy states such opinions.<br>
<br>
All this being said as a rule my dealings with people in thes guilds on a day to day basis is very good and I have nothing but praise for the majority of the ones I run across but as you can see every guild has some bad apples and just as you dont like to be tarred with the same brush as  the bad apples in you guild we dont want to be tarred with the same brush as  bad apples who arent in YOUR guild let alone if they were in ours.<br>
<br>
That being said the common theme amongst these incidents is my Guild is Ubah and yours isn't so therefore if we want something we should  have it. I also wonder sometimes how proud some of these guys are of their Ubah_Guild_00* status... Pre LoY it was amazing how many of these members where fully anon, sometimes a whole group of them and yes even officers. Either they are ashamed or they had something to hide.<br>
<br>
Easy to see why the same conclusion is jumped to again right ?  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94690"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.dilligaf.com.au/faerar/faerarbanner.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eriadoc>Eriadoc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/10/03 10:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=177>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> Well, it has been mentioned in many places, but I would like to state that this Rathe &quot;community&quot; that is continually referred to seems to have striking similarities to society class wars.  98% of the people (non-wealthy) are not represented, while the 2% set rules and standards that best serve their own interests.  This &quot;community&quot; has not taken into consideration the smaller guilds, and in most cases, even the mid-sized guilds.<br>
<br>
I will never support PoP flag mobs being on a rotation, nor will I frown upon teaming up to get flagged for higher level planes.  In the end, if two guilds team up to get into a plane, they still have to survive in that plane on their own.  I don't think you will be seeing Far Seekers taking on Solusek Ro anytime soon, but we would do fine in the 3rd tier planes, and possibly higher.  If the elite guilds on this server want exclusive access to certain content, simply go where the lower-tier guilds cannot go yet (Elemental Planes, PoTime).<br>
<br>
This is not intended to be a flame, by any means (I seldom post here, and those who know me would know better).  However, I don't see too many different ways to read this situation, when it's the high-powered guilds making such a fuss over other people experiencing public game content.  If &quot;cockblocking&quot; is the term of choice for many here, I can certainly understand that viewpoint.  I really can't classify the counter argument as anything but elitism.<br>
<br>

Your insinuation that I can't possibly know what I'm talking about because I have never killed it is shallow to the point of being draught ...and your ability to kill it first does not give you automatic rights to control it in any way you see fit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The community as a whole is more than welcome to talk about and propose general rules regarding rotations or server rules or whatever else, but rotation rules should always be determined by the guilds that are on a rotation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Apparently we can make 'general rules regarding rotations' and 'server rules' (dammit, ah tuld y'all ta stop shit'n in da durn woods!) ...but really, rotations are above our level of intelligence to comprehend y'all's big wurds?  We'z too stoopid ta knowe how ta surf dat der new fangled infoormatun hayway...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A guild that joins a rotation is more than welcome to have input into the rules of that rotation and ask the guilds involved to vote on it, but why should you vote on that rotation if you have nothing to do with it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is like the U.S. Government asking Bill Gates to rewrite the federal tax law! ...lol ...and once you surpass $20 billion ...you too can help re-write the tax law too!  OMG!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The entire idea of joining a rotation is that you are breaking into that rotation. Now in most circumstances, many guilds are willing to give a guild who asks a shot at the mob, but in some cases they may not. This is where racing to that mob may be necessary. You don't have the right to call for a rule change to a rotational mob just because it might make it easier for you to join that rotation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Really?  Wow.  Absolutely wonderful expose'.  What rotation mob are we attempting to make a rule change on again?  I forgot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is absolutely no logic in asking for a vote by the guilds of the server each time a new rotation is set up. The majority of the guilds would be voting on issues they knew nothing about. If an issue affects two or three guilds only, then why would it be necessary for twenty guilds to vote on it? Seems slightly absurd to me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Because ...maybe ...just maybe ...the other guilds might want to have a say in their future?  Naaa... that's silly.  Why would any other guild want to have a voice in their future when you are doing so well in looking out for us and always making sure that we aren't hampered in any way?  Hey!  I have an idea!  The next time there is an abortion bill introduced, lets only let women who have HAD abortions vote! ...truly, they are the only ones who know what they are talking about.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is absolutely no way to argue that having rotations slows down the progress of up and coming guilds. As has been stated thousands of times before, rotations give guilds who are capable of killing a mob a guaranteed chance to kill that mob every x amount of time. If there were no rotations then sure, some guilds might get to kill one mob more often, but they would also probably lose out on other mobs that they wanted to kill.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->1001 now ...and it still has nothing to do with the discussion of Aerin'Dar, Grummus, and Behemoth who are not currently on rotation.  I would have thought after 1000 times, it would mean something by now ...hmm ...guess not.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
...and I think I have previously made a very clear and logical argument using rotations (of Aerin'Dar, Grummus, and Behemoth) as a means to slow down the progression of up and coming guilds.  I've made the argument several times ...should be hard for you to find. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What you currently see is that when a guild decides a rotation is no longer valuable to them, they move to autopass on it. This means there are more kills available to the guilds still on the rotation, as well as new ones joining it.

Yes, I really don’t give a damn what your opinion is on the issue of whether or not sharing Emperor Rifts is appropriate or not among rotation guilds.  You don’t have any, you don’t kill Emp, and your opinion on the matter, while you’re entitled to it, doesn’t mean jack or shit.  Get on rotation, ask if you can have the leftover rifts from other guilds, and when you are told a resounding no, don’t be surprised.  Just because you want to make a change, doesn’t mean it’s going to happen and for good reason.  If you’ve done the work to get there (VT), as FK has, I have no qualms about sharing.

The double standard being an alliance at whim, and of taking two shares of loot off rotation mobs, while needing to team mobs that drop even better loot, but insisting its just “flag progression”, and its all ok because “Hey, there’s a quest”.  Then do the quest. . .last I checked the quest didn’t drop Aerin Dar items, AND it prevents further progression to further gimping of the system by guilds teaming HoH trials or Mith Marr.<br>

<br>
This is fine, I understand your point and find it a positive thing that you have chosen to do this.  However, you (as in those who have killed these mobs) need to determine a way of demarkating who is up and who has killed last.  A mob that has been up for several days is just begging to be ganked by somebody, and I suspect that despite this discussion, CB/VoLS will not be the last to assume that nobody is interested in a mob that has spent half a week unclaimed.  I suggest that you put your heads together and determine a suitable method of removing this mob from FCFS status.  It will likely not be long before complete pick-up raids start forming with people of those 35+ guilds you mentioned to take him and other PoP bosses down.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I would also point back to Emil’s listing of the loot off Aerin Dar, and repeat, that just because a guild bristling with Ssra weapons and VT gear finds those to not be much of an upgrade (and in some cases not an upgrade at all), doesn’t mean that guilds who have never even seen Arch Lich, High Priest, or Creator are going to find his drops anything less than amazing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This may be true, but you will agree that we could care less about what the drops were when compared to the value of another place to gain decent xp (and the spectrals that I am having a hard time buying from large guild mules for 10 to 50K).  With 2 guilds working toward killing AD, the division of one weapon each did very little to improve the overall of dps potential of our guilds.  And the 4 ethereal parchments that dropped were a wonderful joke.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yet no one teams on either of these mobs, why?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Speaking for CB, we don't team them because we can do either without aid.  As for other guilds, I cannot guess<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And again, pointing at content that was once on rotation (Yes, LTK was rotated between TL and NB for about 8 months), and is no longer because it isn't new anymore doesn't have any correlation to new content that is actively desired by 35+ guilds, their sole problem being they can't kill it solo.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sorry, I was unaware that LTK was rotated.  Regardless, you will agree that it is a better example than Trakanon that people keep mentioning.  And the new aspect of PoP that you brought up is not really relevant, is it?  Although ST is three expansions old (ignoring its update), all but two of the 35+ guilds mentioned in your post are still interested in drops from there and only one guild has backed out of all rotations that provide keys for that zone.<br>
<br>
Having strayed a bit off topic, I can see how everyone gets sucked into FC here, something I do my best to avoid. LOL<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to the topic at hand . . . something explicitly agreed upon regarding these flag mobs needs to be hammered out.  Obviously I would favor seeing something that allowed teaming, so we could get the rest of our guild flagged, but anything concrete at this point would be a positive development.  Pointing to several flame threads in various places on the RTA would likely be insufficient evidence of a hard and fast rule.   <p>Gatori Vonhinx<br>

What does that really mean?  It means that 2 guilds of 30-40 people can team up as an alliance (as one entity) for that one mob rotation, while your 1 guild of 72 people can be placed on the same rotation ...essentially now getting twice the amount of BETTER LOOT, by your own admission, because there is only one of you and two of them.  They have to either divide the loot equally among the two, or alternate loot on each cycle.  Either way, each guild in that alliance is getting half of what your one guild is getting.  THAT is the price they pay to be an alliance on that one particular mob.<br>
<br>
So, in the big picture, yes ..they are doubling up on one mob (getting half the loot from that mob ...loot that you say is BETTER than loot from mobs currently on rotation) and still maintaining their individual guild rotations in the old world (1 to 1 ratio compared to you on loot that you say is CRAP compared to what can be found in PoP).  Comparing them any other way is wrong ...in this case, you can't look at the 'big' picture and extrapolate comparisons from it.  That's like saying there should be two attempts per rotation cycle on Mob #1 because his loot is about half as equivalent than Mob #2 who you only get 1 attempt at each cycle.<br>

If your answer is near to or equal to zero, then why was an exception made in this case?&quot;<br>

This is new content I remember Bots and other teaming up for first vox kill at 1 point and I know noble blade has teamed up at 1 time or anther on other mobs.  In fact Noble Blade formed from 2 seperate guilds at 1 point.<br>
<br>
Reason we don't team other mobs?  Well only mobs i think that we couldn't kill are on Rotations thus not allowed and we will abide by these rules.  And if there was a rotation needed on AD then we the same would be true.  <br>
<br>
IF Bohemouth has this ubber loot and everyone wants a piece of him put him on a Rot like other mobs. If someone knows he's goning to spawn they can ask for a shot at him like we do on ALL other rotations or race for him. Or is there only 1 guild wanting his loot?.  Again if this is so it's not hard to send your guild a tell and say hey we would like a shot at mob X when he spawns. <br>
<br>
This is how everything currently works and works well.<br>
Rather a mob flags u or not should not any affect as to rather it's a rotation mob or not. The only thing that matters is rather or not the mob is highly contested.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah we killed Sont as Sladin posted. <p>Tammasoul<br>

Rigorre,<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I particularly enjoy your method of quoting half-sentences and removing all context.  People may groan about the length of my posts, but at least I keep the context of what I quote.<br>
<br>
I don’t enjoy you putting words in my mouth:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> So, in the big picture, yes ..they are doubling up on one mob (getting half the loot from that mob ...loot that you say is BETTER than loot from mobs currently on rotation)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have said, several times, that the loot is as good as VT/Ssra gear, and for guilds not on those rotations to claim Aerin Dar A) doesn’t drop items, or B) those items are subpar, is completely inaccurate.  I’ve already gone out on a limb, and with a fair amount of confidence of being right, that regardless of what items dropped from Aerin Dar that day to CB/VOLS, those two items are among the best those two guilds have seen.  Quite simply, dismissing the quality of his loot as non-existent or subpar is not being accurate.<br>
<br>
Your idea of those mobs being on rotation AND allowing teaming is a step back not forward.  You fail to account for the fact that yes, while they “suffer” by only getting one item each from a mob they normally couldn’t touch on their own, they are getting double the loot every other guild gets on *every* rotation mob they are currently on.  Let’s look at that again, in case you missed it – net gain: 1 item each they can’t get on their own, and one full complete set of loot from all other rotations they are on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> And, once again, you are on the wrong track.

<br>
No, you are demanding my restraint, and I agree it makes sense to show that restraint, but within reason.  I don’t permakill Behemoth so that other guilds can get access to content that isn’t fomally rotated, but because of that restraint, other guilds take advantage of its status of being “up” as a sign no one is interested in it.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Who told you it wasn't?!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So which of this week’s brand new players did you personally set out to make sure they had their input reflected on what goes on here?  Your “registering to vote” if you will.  Since not every player on the Rathe has input on what goes on here, and I mean, *every* player (that guy you watched walk out of the store and who logged onto the Rathe yesterday, yah, him too), that makes it not a representative democracy of the Rathe.  So be careful which way you wave that elitist paintbrush, because we have all agreed to this system for the last three years, and where exactly you fall in that is only determined by what mobs you’ve killed, unassisted.  Haven’t killed Rallos Zek?  Guess what, you don’t get to say one meaningful word about what goes on in running it.  Want input?  Kill him and get on it, then see if you can convince the others that your idea is better.  It’s not a perfect system, but it sure is better than what people on other servers have to put up with.  <br>
<br>
The rotation system was setup to organize sharing between guilds that could kill certain content.  It makes no sense to share with someone who can’t kill said content.  Think I’m the only one who realizes this?  Last time you killed DesireableBigMob X, did you ask the other 3 people in the zone if they wanted to take their fair shot at the mob?  If you didn’t, why not?  Aren’t we all about sharing and complete altruism?  Isn’t that the high horse your riding on?  <br>
<br>
So to answer your question, yes, those guilds who killed it first get to set the precedents on the server – that is how this game has evolved on all levels.  Where and how do you think various zone conventions came from?  Why are the Arch Magi and Ghoul Lord separate camps on our server?  Why does the Frenzied Ghoul get the Sentinel as well?  From the first people into the zone making up common sense, fair rules that make sense.  Trying to claim King and Lord at the same time is impractical (back when the level cap was L 50 and King was a 2 group camp).  If you look beyond your own drive for “new phat xp zones”, you’d see that these are fair rules we’ve played by for the last three years.  Inflating your numbers for one encounter, while rotating other content as separate entities just isn’t fair to the rest of the people who remain separate entities for all content and play within the means their guild’s abilities and skills can provide for them.<br>

<br>
Who made those RTA rotation rules you list as the Constitution?  Were you even playing?  If you were, was it in a capacity that had anything to do with the high end game on the Rathe?  If you weren’t, you honestly think it was our responsibility to go to each of 5-10,000 players who log on at various times of day playing from all around the world and make sure to ask each and every one what their vote was on matters that they had absolutely no understanding of?  No, it wasn’t, and in such a free form society as EQ is, that is not how you make order out of chaos.  You create a system that the strong will buy into, or else the system won’t work.  Fortunately, our system dealt with how people would later be added to the “exclusivity” of the rotations, so that it had buy in from the smaller guilds knowing that diligence and effort would pay off and if they followed the rules and conventions of the system, that it would pay off.  It’s a delicate balance, but make no bones about it, it’s not a democracy based on making sure everyone gets unlimited guaranteed chances at whatever content they might desire, nor on people giving input into rotations they aren’t participants on.  I’m not going out of my way to wait on United Necros to get enough keys to kill Emp before I kill him again, nor is FK nor is SoTE.  When they get the keys, and can kill Blood, then they can take their shot, having shown they at least understand what is required to win.  Once they are on rotation, they can give ideas on how to better run the rotation, but as its fairly simple and very effective at sharing content between those who can kill, it’s hard to improve on.<br>
<br>
As for you referencing the EULA and PnP policies, be careful, there is a LOT of leeway on what can be done there that doesn’t violate those.  And even violating those, doesn’t seem to carry as harsh a sentence as you might hope (sadly).<br>

<br>
Noble Blade and Spirit of Tunare teamed up on one Avatar of War, one hour before server was coming down, AFTER both of us had already killed it ourselves, several times each.  This was done to prevent loot from being eaten by the patch, and it was made very clear that if BOTS or Tindi wanted Avatar of War, he was all theirs.  You kill Aerin Dar on your own, even once, and I don’t care who you bring to your raid.  Chances are if you could kill Aerin Dar alone, you wouldn’t begin wholesale flagging of people from 35 other guilds.<br>
<br>
As for us forming from two guilds, yes, we were Noble House and Silver Blade.  We were one entity for all rotations and reservations.  We are now one guild, and have been since Dec 5, 2000.  We are still one entity for all rotations.  I practice what I preach.<br>

<br>
The unwritten, backdoor room conventions made up by the big guilds and the smoking man, is that you don’t back to back kill FCFS mobs, especially PoP mobs so that we can all get what we need.  Its made easier by the fact that if a guild has extra flags they don’t need, you can send along a few to get them taken care of.  It’s a really nice system when you’re done with needing flags and another guild has a recently player return from retirement because they hit new content they want to check out.  And as for that tell, you can’t begin to understand how amazingly difficult it is for other guilds to do that.  I guess it’s pride, I dunno, but recently I had a member of a guild try and work out a shot on a rotation mob and that member got chewed out for being civil and asking.<br>

I disagree.  I don't think BotS cares one way or the other as long as the definition is clear and will not allow creep.  I can't claim to represent BotS but I can raise questions to anything I think needs to be questioned.<br>
<br>
I see some folks who do not think the question is moot.  NB has said that they would like to kill AD every chance they get but do not to prevent anyone from accusing them of cockblocking.

<br>
Please see above at the countless times the similarities between PoP flag mobs and other rotation mobs have been made.<br>
<br>
1)  Rare spawn (3+ days)<br>
2)  Contested spawn (35 guilds+ looking to kill)<br>
3)  Desireable loot (for ANY non-VT/Ssra guild)<br>
<br>
Just because you can't make the internal connection between the similarities doesn't invalidate the argument.  We are not talking about two guilds teaming up on Orc_Pawn01 who respawns every 10-20 minutes and there are 31 of in the zone, and has been in the game since 3/19/1999.  We are talking about a precedent that could allow 3, 4, 5, guilds to permafarm Aerin Dar for flags and loot until everyone on the Rathe got their HoH flag and they all got their respective desired items.  This would have the increased negative impact that guilds that can and do still want access to Aerin Dar would lose that same access, at which point, the teaming guilds would lose the right to do what they have been doing.  So you're suggesting, that simply because people COULD, but haven't, teamed on Burrower, THO, TIV (all of whom have no keys to any zones, so their relevance to PoP mobs is questionable), we should go on a merry-go-round that winds us right back where we say we should be in the first place:  No guilds teaming on PoP flag mobs, UNLESS they become a formal alliance for all mobs.<br>
<br>
And make no bones about it, those of you who insist we've all moved on and don't want or need Aerin Dar ever again, and should only need to kill 2-3 times, &quot;MAX&quot; - we're at 7 kills, and still need 1 member and 4 new recruits flagged.  Two of those ID 4 necklaces wouldn't be bad, nor would two of those almost Emp quality 2H. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karadin>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM<BR>

And Gromm, its not AD for us, its Behemoth.  Aerin Dar only has good necklaces (for us), and maybe a few 2H, as VT is not stocked with weapons and Ssra rotations have become quite full.  However, we do still need 5 more flags off Aerin.  Behemoth by contrast has a very nice ring, shoulder, and belt that we have seen thus far. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nyca>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Singing Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 1553<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/10/03 7:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=204>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/slllyonec/EZemo/LeahHarp2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> The word is &quot;moot&quot;, not &quot;mute&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigorre>Rigorre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/10/03 7:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=205>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So, because some day I might move to New York, I should get to vote for thier Mayor?

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your idea of those mobs being on rotation AND allowing teaming is a step back not forward. You fail to account for the fact that yes, while they “suffer” by only getting one item each from a mob they normally couldn’t touch on their own, they are getting double the loot every other guild gets on *every* rotation mob they are currently on. Let’s look at that again, in case you missed it – net gain: 1 item each they can’t get on their own, and one full complete set of loot from all other rotations they are on.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I do see what you are saying, Karadin ...and comparing apples to apples, you are wrong. You really gotta let go of this picture you have of an alliance.  Think of it as entries on a rotation.<br>
<br>
Tindi is a player on ...oh, lets just say (because I'm too tired to do more homework) ...15 rotations and lets just imagine for a minute that Aerin'Dar was a rotation mob but without the 'no team' rule.<br>
<br>
Team_Guild_01 is a player on the same 15 rotations, but one of those rotations is Aerin'Dar in which they SHARE their rotation entry with ...<br>
<br>
Team_Guild_02 who is also a player on the same 15 rotations as Tindi and, as stated, shared rotation for Aerin'Dar.<br>
<br>
Tindi = 15 rots, Team_Guild_01 = 14.5 rots, Team_Guild_02 = 14.5 rots.<br>
<br>
Now, what YOU are doing ...and what I contend is wrong ...is that you are adding the two guilds together (14.5 + 14.5 = 29 rots &gt; 15 rots).  Not exactly sure what the logic is behind combining all of their rots together, simply because they share 50% on one rotation... a rotation which, by the way, you have a full 100%.  You could probably get away with this if the alliance was taking up 2 rotation entries - one each per guild on the alliance, which would put them teaming up for the same 100% as Tindi ...that's not happening.  They are still taking a 50% penalty for teaming, no matter how you slice it and dice it.<br>
<br>
Nope, I don't see it.  You aren't taking into account the 50% penalty, me thinks.  And when you think about it on a rotation by rotation basis, each guild is only getting 1 rotation on every other mob, just like Tindi.  How do you see that Guild_Team_01 is all of a sudden getting 'double the loot'?<br>

Don't we HAVE RTA Representatives from each guild (well, you call them posting authorities ...and I know that doesn't include every 10-person guild ...but the theory is somewhat sound)?  And, don't those representatives speak for their respective guilds on matters of RTA policy?  And, when a policy is brought forth, do those representatives pass or fail said policy by majority vote?  What part of that isn't 'representative democracy' again?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So be careful which way you wave that elitist paintbrush, because we have all agreed to this system for the last three years, and where exactly you fall in that is only determined by what mobs you’ve killed, unassisted. Haven’t killed Rallos Zek? Guess what, you don’t get to say one meaningful word about what goes on in running it. Want input? Kill him and get on it, then see if you can convince the others that your idea is better. It’s not a perfect system, but it sure is better than what people on other servers have to put up with.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Hmm... brings back memories of &quot;I'm bigger than you are so I get 2 votes!&quot;.  Apparently, after 3 years, the natives wanna rebel.  All of this would be fine and dandy if you were 'elected' to be Masters and Lords, but I somehow doubt that's what happened ...more like you appointed yourselves and it's been that way ever since.  Note to self:  I'll need to start all of my posts from now on with &quot;oh, Lord of on high, I am not worthy to be questioning you yet again, but ...&quot;. <br>
<br>
You know what, you paint a very bleek picture of what I believed this community was about, and truly, I'm beginning to question whether our less than perfect system is better than what people on other servers have to put up with.  At least then, when you are getting slapped in the face and kicked in the balls ...you know you are, rather than having to follow some archaic &quot;I am holier than thou&quot; laws meant to manipulate and control your progression.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I see SOTE, LoM, and VOF against teaming as well. Thus far, everyone who has killed Aerin Dar on their own is on one side of the argument, and everyone who has teamed or wants to team, is on the other side. What does that tell you?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Actually, let me put some words in your mouth.  I think you meant to say &quot;Thus far, everyone who has killed Aerin'Dar on their own is on one side of the argument, and ...well ...hell, everyone else is on the other&quot;.<br>
<br>
It tells me ...and it should tell you ...that you are going the exact wrong direction when it comes to Aerin'Dar, Grummus, and Behemoth.  I've said it before, I'll say it again, rotating those mobs with a 'no team' rule can only be seen as a direct and definitive measure to control and restrict progression of Tier 1 and Tier 2 guilds into the higher PoP planes.  Rotate those mobs, but exclude the 'no team' rule ...everyone will be happy.  It is a compromise that I thought you would be able to live with given that you get your rotation (happy happy joy joy) and we get our access to a few more zones.  I mean, really, you act like the freaking world is going to blow up if you allow this one proposal to come into existance.  I can assure you, your game will continue on almost completely unhindered.<br>

<br>
I can't read all this but I think I see what you are saying.<br>
<br>
However, you forget the penalty of not teaming up... which means that both guilds get 0% and the other guilds get it all.  By teaming, they get *some*.  If they didn't team, they would get none.  So... anything &gt; 0.  After all, if they could kill the mob on their own, why are they teaming to begin with? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50>General</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246f<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
