<br>
There was a little dwarf who was born from a poor family. Mama and Papa did all they could to make life easier for this dwarf, but that wasn't enough. One day this little dwarf decided to venture out and make a living for himself. He began his life killing little critters and selling off what he could acquire off them to older folks around the neighboring towns. He did fairly well for himself. After a few weeks he was ready to venture out and join other young dwarfs and elves. This went quite well for him. He made many new friends and increased his riches nicely. He returned home to tell his parents of his new achievements. <br>
Many years later the young dwarf grew into a fairly notable rogue. He was well liked and very welcomed where ever he went. He has made many more new friends and one or two enemies. But the one person he has grown attached to was a young cleric named, Moore. Moore taught him the way of life at this fairly young level and informed the young rogue that life will only get better. The young dwarf was also introduced to the way of the guilds. Moore told the young rogue of a great guild named &quot;Valorguard&quot;. The dwarf was excited and every day waited with anticipation of the new and fabulous stories Moore would tell of Valorguards conquests and travels. The one thing that the young dwarf wished for more than anything else was to find a Family like the one Moore has told him so much about.<br>
The young dwarf grew older and wiser. Many things has been seen and heard about this dwarf. One day he was asked to come with Valorguard and introduce himself. This made the dwarf very happy and nervous. He kept thinking to himself, &quot;what if they don't like me?&quot;, &quot;what if I make a fool of myself?&quot;, and mostly &quot;how will I conduct myself in the presence of what I hold most dear?&quot;. Moore told this rogue to relax and be himself, for he is good the way he is. The day has come for the rogue to join Valorguard in the field of battle, there were many of them. Most of them were great people of noble stature. He felt out of place. &quot;What is a rogue like me doing amongst these valiant people?&quot;, he thought to himself. The battle was over and Valorguard was victorious. The dwarf was proud of himself for holding his own and aiding when it counted. His actions were recognized and appreciated. The rogue was welcomed to join them again in future battles.<br>
A few years go by and the rouge felt a part of him really belonged in the family known as Valorguard. He lend his heart and dagger whenever needed without a second thought. Both he and the guild got along well. One fairly calm summer afternoon, a great and powerful enchantress came to this dwarf and sat down beside him. She told him that his actions were a great asset and he was very prompt to help when needed. She gave him an offer he couldn't refuse. &quot;We would like to invite you to join Valorguard..&quot;<br>
The dwarf fell head over heels as he heard this soft spoken voice say the one thing he yearned to hear. He eagerly accepted and was offered the invitation. Tears ran down his cheeks as a smile from ear to ear crossed his face. He was overwhelmed with joy as he heard the guild welcome him to their family. The rogue finally knew what it was like to have a family. <br>
AS the years passed by, the rogue and his family defeated great beasts and many monsters. The rogue was always anticipating the next adventure. He knew not of what lies before him, but knew that in the end he and his family will prevail with riches and fame. Valorguard was victorious against monsters such as giants, wurms, and dragons. Many, many riches was earned for himself as well the guild. The young rogue forgot all about the past and worked for nothing but the future. <br>
During the times of the great wars, the rogue become very close to a particular person. Some one he considered as a brother. As a matter of fact, his new brother is also a rogue. The two of them got along very well and grew closer as they grew together. They respected each others goals and achievements. They never thought of themselves as one better than the other, they were equals. Each as excited for the others acquirements as if it were their own. The dwarf rogue studied and learned from this halfling rogue. It was fore seen that Deeleeryous and this dwarf were inseparable. They worked together like clockwork, as if they knew what the other was thinking.<br>
Recently, this dwarf rogue has been seen venturing on his own tasks. He has taking on the challenge of finding new things to do and training his skills. He sat many days and night in the cold lands and often times in the heat of the desserts. He traveled all over this great world and often times to the lunar planes of the moon. He has seen many wonderful things and fought many powerful beasts. He alone would never had experienced this, but with the help of Valorguard, he has. For this he is grateful and will never forget the great times he had, nor the people he met. They will always be a part of him forever.<br>

Shanenagans is no more.  Shane will be rotting at the bottom of the ocean in Oasis with all his no drop equip on.  The rest of the dropable was distributed through the guild.  Shanenagans WILL NOT be EBAYed nor sold to anyone.  In a few weeks he shall be deleted and my account will be canceled.  I want to take this time to Thank everyone that I played with.  You all made this game fun and entertaining, all I hope is that I shared the same feeling to you.  I want to also Thank Valorguard for helping me put Shane to sleep.  You guys made it so much easier.  So go enjoy the game and make friends.  <br>
