I can guarantee CoG has more than 1 cleric. There's one in my guild who has been going with a couple other guilds on planes raids. He took a deep breath and signed up for the CoG raid. When he arrived all was going well, attendance being taken and people being polite. Then groups were formed and he was sent a VERY rude tell to join up. Granted some may have taken it as a compliment what was said but NO one is to be sworn at NO MATTER WHAT. He repeated what was said in ooc, I relayed it to a couple of you, it was talked about in guild speech and he camped out with the comment &quot;well looks like CoG has lost a cleric for the evening&quot; GOOD JOB GUYS he was a lvl 54 too. Its more like they are being made unwelcome than anything else. Now the person who said it you know who you are and yes I am TICKED to think you thought that was ok. When our cleric gets an appology for the comment I'm sure one of us can twist his arm into coming on a raid with us again rather than going with his other friends who want him.<br>
<br>
and PS. I would have GLADLY taken a 39 rez just to get back in the right zone a couple times and not lost everything like an un rezzable corpse.<br>

Pippi said the Sacred Band has only one cleric +46, not the CoG.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As for the incident that happened, I'm sure none of the raid commanders who run raids here condone that sort of behavior, I'm certain that the Sacred Band does not.  Did you speak with the raid commander at the time?  If this happened on the Fear raid which this thread is discussing, it was never brought to my attention, I can assure you I would have dealt with it.  Sometimes raid commanders are too busy to read all the stuff that floats through /ooc and in a situation like this, a direct tell is certainly called for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub68.ezboard.com/uplangstrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>P Langstrump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/18/01 11:02:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interlog.com/~wings/jane/a_lindgren/lindgren_pics/pippi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR RAID CONCERNS I HAVE</span><hr size=1> Ok ... one thing .. I think people have to realize that this is a huge gathering of strangers ...<br>
<br>
Lag, you know quite well that after you told me about the incidence, I talked to the person who uttered the insult in tell, I've asked you to tell him to cut it out or he is off the raid, I warned Zellex about him, and, finally, I spent 10 minutes in OOC (right after you told me about it) warning people that swearing and being rude will not be accepted and that it should be reported to me or someone else at the raid.  <br>
<br>
Remember, this is not a legislative or executive power, if there are people that don't know how to be civil continuously, off the raid they go. And that applies to mostly OOC, shouts, says, emotes and groupsays (if we can catch it)... if it's something uttered in tell, and noone else speaks up about that person's rudeness, how do you expect us to kick someone out based on that?  It is your responsibility to bring it to light and get enough evidence to get the person booted.  Otherwise, there is an easy way to get rid of people someone doesn't want on the raid (&quot;Hmm, too many druids, can't get a good chance at the loot... &quot;(in OOC)  druid xxx just insulted me in tell!!!&quot;) ... how enforcing would you like us to be? Not sure exactly what you expected.<br>
<br>
The only thing I can promise you is that if you want an apology from the rude person next time, please let me know, and I can personally oblige to that ... if someone is rude to me, I typically pursue getting an apology myself off of that person, and I would be more than glad to do it for anyone else.  Logging because no apology is offered is just one way of dealing with it.  <br>
<br>
Please remember, every single individual person at the raid has a responsibility to deal with these types of situations, it's not a &quot;report-this-person-and-have-the-raid-leader-boot-him&quot; straight up. <br>
<br>
Btw, yea, I was talking about the number of clerics in the Sacred Band alliance, the only grouping that has so far stepped up to run these plane raids.  I am sure if another alliance / guilds runs it, we would get more clerics for certain just due to the fact that that alliance / guild has more clerics to start with. I hope this clarifies it.  The CoG is really not a consistent body of people by choice, it only appears so because not many people are bold enough to step up to this type of challenge.<br>

Sadly I was not available on the evening of mention, but the screenshot of the controversial tell was sent my way:<br>
<br>
[I have edited this image out, because it should have been sent to me to deal with and not posted on a public forum. I will make sure that the person who said this is at least talked to. - Haemish]<br>
<br>
Does this show their entire conversation?  No.<br>
<br>
From my understanding, this was the tell Iluvatar received and reacted to.<br>
<br>
 If it was unprovoked, I cannot blame him for logging - his intentions have always been to heal and help, I do not see how this day would be any different. He had worked all day, was tired, and had no reason to go along to Fearplane but to help.<br>
 If it was provoked on behalf of Iluvatar, I would be very interested if you could share the entire story. I believe my guild members, this does not ensure that it is the entire truth.<br>
<br>
From my own perspective as a bard:<br>
 I love breaking and pulling in Fear. There is nothing there for me, and generally as the puller, you die more often than you see experience text. I do it to support friends, and because it is both fun and dangerous.<br>
 When people are rude, the game gets frustrating, or things get boring - there is no reason to play for me.  Everquest is a game that I play for fun, not for grief.<br>
<br>
Where are all the clerics?<br>
 Some may feel that they only need to visit Hate.<br>
<br>
 A few are much more selfless, and patient. They are in it for everyone else, and to strengthen the alliance.<br>
<br>
Perhaps those are the ones that be kept close, and given the bit of respect which they deserve. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub68.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 2/18/01 3:53:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub68.ezboard.com/uplangstrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>P Langstrump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/18/01 10:02:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interlog.com/~wings/jane/a_lindgren/lindgren_pics/pippi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR RAID CONCERNS I HAVE</span><hr size=1> what alliance? <br>

As for respect of individuals, that is what the CoG about.  But the CoG cannot protect everyone from everything ... sometimes you have to be responsible for personally ensuring the level of respect you wish, for yourself or other people - that's something no alliance, guild, loosely-based-forum (CoG) can do for you.  They can deal with blatantly obvious damage and malicious intent, but everything else, if someone wanted to control for it, is bordering close to tyranny. <p><HR>

In my opinion his tell wasn't even something that was offensive enough to be ashamed of. I don't think it is even a matter of being so offensive to pull someone aside and talk to them - many of us are in countries of free speech.<br>
<br>
However, I could see how you could be discouraged from playing - and that was the point I was trying to bring across.<br>

This is mostly for tanks, but I suppose it applies to nuking-type casters as well (never played one, couldn't say...)<br>
<br>
1) Always make an &quot;/assist &lt;name of main assist person as stated by raid admin&gt;&quot; hotkey.<br>
<br>
2) Use your hotkey.  Always.  Never enter combat by targeting a mob and hitting auto-attack.  This will get everyone killed.<br>
<br>
3) If the main assist is dead or not present, target your group leader and type &quot;/ass&quot;.  If your group leader is on the wrong target, at least your whole group will be fighting it.  If you have a low opinion of your group leader, typing &quot;/ass&quot; while targeting them can be fun, too.<br>
<br>
4) If your group leader is dead, target a tank already in combat and type &quot;/ass&quot;.<br>
<br>
5) Never, never ever, never never never NEVER N-E-V-E-R enter combat by targeting a mob yourself and hitting auto-attack.  This will get everyone killed (see rule 2).  We really mean it about getting everyone killed.<br>
<br>
This ain't rocket science folks.  If an enchanter mezzes a mob, and you poke it with the sharp pointy thing someone was dumb enough to let you hold, it's gonna go kill the 'chanter right quick.  Being dead makes it difficult for an enchanter to continue mez'ing mobs, so you end up fighting multiple creatures, and everyone dies.<br>
<br>
Sub-point to those folks who are the main assists:  try to make sure you are in melee range of a mob (and preferably already auto-attacking it) when you call your targets as this tends minimize /assist bugs in my experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
Section 2: Listening to directions and asking questions.<br>
<br>
If you are getting directions on how to drive through a nasty part of town, you'll probably listen pretty carefully and make sure you get it right the first time, yeah?<br>
<br>
The Plane of Fear is a pretty nasty part of town.  Listen up, think about what you are doing, and try and get it right the first time.<br>
<br>
If you don't understand something, or are unclear about ANYTHING, ask.  Ask your group leader, ask someone in raid admin, ask in OOC, but ASK!<br>
<br>
Remember: Stupid questions are much easier to deal with than stupid mistakes!<br>
<br>
Corrolary (sp?):  Don't make fun of someone for asking a dumb question... if you do, they might not ask next time, make a dumb mistake instead, and get you killed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Section 3:  Courtesy saves lives.<br>
<br>
Be courteous to others, if not for the sake of being a nice person, then for the sake of staying alive longer.  Think about this:<br>
<br>
If you are frustrated or angry, you are not thinking as clearly as you normally would be, your judgement is worse, and you will make more mistakes and poor choices.  Making mistakes in places like the Plane of Fear gets everyone killed.<br>
<br>
If you are rude or disrespectful to someone, they may become angry or frustrated.  This will make them think less clearly and make more mistakes.  This will get everyone killed, including you.<br>
<br>
So be nice to everyone, you'll live longer.<br>

<font size=2>An Alliance is...."in interguild relations, a formal agreement between two or more guilds for mutual support in case of war. An alliance provides for combined action on the part of two or more independent states and is usually defensive in form, since it obligates allies to join forces if one or more of them is attacked by another guild. Alliances are typically defined by a treaty, the most critical clauses of which are those that define the casus foederis, or the circumstances under which an ally becomes obligated to aid a fellow ally..." The Council of Guilds is not an alliance. Basta.</font>
