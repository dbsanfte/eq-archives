<br>
I personally feel that KCoG dragons and planes raids SHOULD be restricted to those smaller guilds who do NOT belong to alliances. Guilds who belong to alliances, such as mine (Haven of Light/AoVB), will always have the opprotunities to be on rotations for dragons, planes, etc. <br>
<br>
After all, isn't the purpose of KCoG to give smaller guilds the opprotunity to experience these types of raids who otherwise might NEVER get the chance?<br>
<br>
Guilds who belong to alliances generally do participate in rotations for dragons, planes, etc. By letting allied guilds participate in KCoG, I feel and think we take spots from those smaller guilds who can not normally participate on these types of events. <br>
<br>
Please bear in mind this is only MY personal opinion and does NOT reflect on the views of my guild or alliance. I think its safe to say that we have enjoyed the opprotunity to be part of KCoG and are thankful that you have included us your events. I do, however, feel its time for some of us to be a bit more considerate to other smaller guilds. For some people and guilds, KCoG is the ONLY chance for them to experience these events.<br>
<br>
Bearing this in mind, I will in all likelyhood not be attending any KCoG events in the future. Please do not misunderstand me. It is not because of anything that has transpired within KCoG, but rather its because I feel its selfish for me to take a spot from someone else who may not ever have the same opprotunities as me. With that being said, I truly wish all of you the best of luck in KCoG. Haemish keep up the great work!<br>

ALL of the CoG events are for all on the server. The ONLY events that are restricted are dragon raids, and THOSE are only restricted because of KGC restrictions on who can make up the majority of the raid team on those raids. The planes are NOT currently restricted in this way because KGC doesn't require it. <br>
<br>
However, the CoG runs events that have nothing to do with KGC rotations and I would hope you feel comfortable going to those because you are welcome at any of them. Chess tourneys, Mixer Hunts, the Mixer Dance, etc. I only put this poll up to get the general idea of what people who visit this forum feel. <br>

I like the idea of CoG raids that bring together lots of people from diverse player segments, whom someone might not otherwise have a chance to meet.  Tho I am now a member of Valoran, and we are a guild capable of supporting our own plane raids, I would like to still attend CoG events.  On the one hand you are saying I can, and on the other you are saying I can't.

<br>
Currently this is the way the CoG works:<br>
<br>
Planes raids<br>
-------------<br>
Ex. 1: Valoran member (a guild that does Planes Raids all on their own, without any other guilds, i.e. not in an alliance) should not sign up for planes raids sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
Ex. 2: Sign of One member (a guild that currently does planes raids, but they do it as part of an alliance with the Silent Watch, I believe) CAN and SHOULD sign up for a planes raid sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
Ex. 3: Mist Walkers member (a guild that does not currently do planes raids either by itself or in an alliance) CAN and SHOULD sign up for planes raids sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
<br>
Dragon Raids<br>
------------<br>
Ex. 1 Valoran member (a guild that is in the dragon rotation by itself) should not sign up for dragon raids sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
Ex. 2 Sign of One member (a guild that is in the dragon rotation in an alliance with Silent Watch) should not sign up for dragon raids sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
Ex. 3 Mist Walkers member (a guild that is not currently in the dragon rotation either by itself or in an alliance) CAN and SHOULD sign up for Council of Guilds dragon raids<br>
<br>
ALL OTHER Council of Guilds Events<br>
----------------------------------<br>
Unless specified by the organizer, ALL other CoG events are open to ANY of the above examples<br>
<br>
Now what the question above is asking is this:<br>
<br>
In the planes raids examples above, should the Sign of One member (and I'm just using them as an example) sign up for the Planes raids, since his guild can already do the planes, albeit in an alliance? <br>
<br>
The Current Karana Guild Central guidelines (which is the body that keeps the schedules and rotations for planes, dragons and gods) say that if you are in the dragon or god rotation, you shouldn't have a lot of (or even more than 2 or 3) members at someone else's dragon or god raid, because that's giving you an unfair amount of chances at something we've all agreed to share. There is no such restriction on the planes (except that guilds doing the planes by themselves shouldn't be on other people's or alliances planes raids). <br>
<br>
Please keep in mind, the Council of Guilds DOES so much MORE than just planes and dragon raids. They just happen to be what most people seem to fixate on, but it's really just a small portion of what we do.<br>

<br>
But then again, you can usually recognize those easily as being the ones not coming to any other CoG events or complaining about the quality and efficiency of CoG plane raids by comparing them to &quot;their&quot; raids <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p><HR>

I think the CoG is a wonderful group of people, and I had so much fun at the Chess Match. It was fun listening to Skrim and Adol go at each other in fun.

<br>
I feel VERY lucky to have the AoVB to do raids with, and the CoG to kick back and get silly with. I think Haemish, and the governing body of CoG does a GREAT job. I have a lot of respect for them.<br>

<br>
Seriously, I want to address another thing about the CoG... there is no governing body. There isn't anyone that makes up the rules, those rules are pretty much made up on the spot by whoever happens to be in charge of whatever event.<br>
<br>
I've actually heard buzz out there that people think the CoG is some body of law that can be turned to when someone KS's someone else, or ninjaloots, and people that think we control planes raids and rotations. I have no idea where people get that idea, and am horrified by it. Is there something I've done to make people think that? <br>
<br>
We're all making this up as we go along! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'm betting Cretar is not the only one out there who is loyal to their guild, yet unable to attend certain events due to time constraints. We of the CoG are not about penalizing someone due to their guild affiliation... quite the opposite, in fact. To that end, I voted to restrict those guilds in alliances to six signups. I think that's enough to keep it from being overly abused if someone was of a mind to, and at the same time keep the door open to make sure we're not needlessly excluding people from being able to attend these type events.<br>

<br>
- Any Guild, or major alliance that frequently attend plane raids are not allowed to go on CoG raids.<br>
<br>
Now, if one person from another alliance, or major guild signs up, I usually look the other way.  As long as the numbers are not extremely, causing me to turn away CoG people I don't care.<br>
<br>
Also, sometime I recruit people from my management staff from other major guilds.  Originally I was thinking of having my plane raids being sponsored by all the other major guilds, and sort of make it Server wide interaction.  However, that never really worked out.  But I still reserve the right up to 12 people of my choosing to help out.  I have only been using like 3 to 4 slots.  And if I bring them along, I have them do some sort of management task.<br>
<br>
Then, there's a few guilds that do not go to planes frequently because all their members except a few have all plane armor.  Again, there's a fine line here, but the whole purpose of this raid is to give the people the chance to go to the planes that couldn't get a chance (primarily because they are in a small guild).<br>
<br>
Afterall, if we want to be technical, I can't go on CoG raids myself, as the The Watchmen are part of the CoK alliance.  They go to the planes just about every week, and are on rotation for the big targets.<br>
<br>
So it is an interesting and valid question.<br>
<br>
Whether they should or should not?  I think it's alright, unless we get to the point we have to turn away people from small guilds because they are attending.  One or two people here and there isn't a big deal. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzellex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zellex</A> at: 2/2/01 6:25:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umigg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Migg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/4/01 12:51:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Should Alliances be allowed on CoG Planes Raids? </span><hr size=1> Ok simple answer to this ..<br>
<br>
Do they allow us to go with them on raids? if so yes then let them come with the same rules as they apply on us. <br>
<br>
IE <br>
<br>
they let us go but no loot unless all there do not need.<br>
then the same should apply to those who join us on a raid.<br>

Or if they do not allow us to go with them then I say NO they are not allowed to go with us<br>

It hasn't really come up before, at least not that I know of. <br>
<br>
How about it? Any of the alliances that are doing planes on their own have some representatives that would like to address this? <br>

Well since my posted response, I have had the time to talk to many others and have read many repsonses on this subject. In retrospect, I guess I was a bit hasty in saying I would or should not participate in future KCoG events. My concern was with myself and possibly my guild taking up many spots from other people and guilds. In actuality, there isnt a huge chunk from my guild that usually do participate. Its usually just a couple, if that. So based on what I have read and what has been said, I appologize to you all for my hasty remarks and I hope I didnt offend anyone. If you guys will have me, I'll glady participate with you guys when I can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And even then I saw people getting a backup set of armor before letting a guest get something in some cases.  I heard some cases where guilds allowed guests (especially if they are close friends of members) allowed to roll on things no one cared even if they lacked.<br>
<br>
Also may I have an explanation as to why members from guilds who book one plane solo every week are treated differently from a 2 guilds alliance who book one plane every week?  If you are to allow folks, even in a limited number, who are already doing their plane raid in a given week you need to clarify this I think.<br>

Since one of the stated purpose is to allow those who aren't able to get to the planes with their guild to be able to experience a plane raid, I would hate to know that there are folks who are being denied this privilege by those who already have this privilege in another form. <br>
<br>
However, looking for every person's guild affiliation and then checking it against the number of alliance out there is a BIG organizational hassle. I would only attempt to restrict it in this if I felt that there were those missing out. <br>

<br>
1. I would have to do at least 3 raids with them before i got a chance at any loot.<br>
<br>
2. after the 3 Raids I would be allowed to Roll on an Item that i was told i was aloud to roll for (so i would get to roll on Rare gems and Trinkets/Words).<br>
<br>
3. I would not get to Roll on Armor, I would only get armor if no one else needed it.<br>
<br>
I have been told this by friends of mine in a couple different guilds that i have gone along with to either  Planes or even Raids to places such as Dragon Necropolis, where once again i was not alowed to roll on anything.  But i did get the Cobalt scar tooth while going there.<br>
<br>
As to being able to join them on these Raids, it wasnt as simple as a Sign up. I had to leave a post on their Site begging (which I am not good at) to go and if the Guild Leader thought that they could use me i would be alowed to go and only then if they had the space for another person.<br>
<br>
If we have to go through that to go with them, why should they go with us? They have their own space in the rotation and as to timing, I have stayed up till 9 the next morning a couple times to go on raids with my guild leader who plays at the oriental times. Those raids started at 2 in the morning for me. If you want to go on a raid you find a way to do it. The purpose of the CoG raids I'm gathering is so that us smaller guilds who aren't in major planes capable alliances can actually go. I believe VERY strongly that since we cant do 2 raids a week why should they be allowed to? Just because they didn't sign up to go on their own alliance's raid they still had the chance to. Its not like we dont already have waiting lists with CoG as it is.<br>
<br>
Anyway I've ranted long enough.<br>

Similarly, I've always thought of CoG as a place where individuals were seen and respected as individuals rather than belonging to a specific guild. <br>
<br>
CoG is not an alliance, and as such, anyone who is willing to volunteer their goodwill and join the fun has an equal say in the events - well, ok, the person organizing has a bit more of a say <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   but who says that you can't organize your own thing for the CoG?<br>
<br>
Verant has set some basic intrinsic game rules, and there are a few additional ones set up by the CoG, but as you may notice, there are only a few limiting ones.  All these rules are publicly and openly discussed here, and if anyone else wants to try out new approaches or systems, here is the forum to suggest and do it ... I've done a couple of atypical rulings and raids on my own, and it's always fun to swim a bit against the stream <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
... just always keep in mind that open and upfront communication is the most critical part of any of these &quot;experiments&quot;<br>
<br>
oh yes, I am making a guess that people who clearly obsess over items won't enjoy CoG events at all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
