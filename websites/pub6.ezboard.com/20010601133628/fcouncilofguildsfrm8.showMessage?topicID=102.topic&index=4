<br>
Unfortunately it is the whiners and complainers that make the most noise, but believe me when I say that everybody there was impressed by the way that you lead an unbelievable number of players on that Vox raid.  Discipline was great although there seems to be problems that may never be solved: pushing giants through walls (didn't happen this time), and keeping Vox in her lair.  <br>
<br>
There were MANY people on that raid who had never been on a dragon raid, or never been on a Vox raid.  4 out of 6 people in my group were first-timers.  Your patience and ability to deal with all the problems this creates for raid leadership is simply amazing.<br>
<br>
Thank you again for another great SB/CoG victory.<br>

I had that cloak in the palm of my hand, it was so close.  I was jumping up and down in my chair, then holding my breath, I was getting tells from everyone &quot;woohooo Cre&quot; and then bam, Brisos out-rolled me.  Well done Brisos, truly.<br>

I am just very happy that I was allowed to be a part of it.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately due to computer problems, I was not able to turn over the crystalline blade that I looted.  Therefore, Benolyen or Briyn who ever did not get their blade, I appologize.  Please look for me in game and I will try and get the blade to you.  Thanks.<br>

In the case of Vox over 66 individuals went.  Really you could do this with probablely 30 to 40 people.  We take so many people because the raid is supposed to provide an oppurtunity for those that can't do these events otherwise, we realize that lower numbers need people used to working with each other to be successful and to a certain extent we can't say no.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately people can slip through and not be included properly or at all.  This has never been done intentionally to anyone, ever. I understand your being upset when this happens and your disappointment, you want to go, you signed up and you made the time.<br>
<br>
It would seem to be necessary to point out some of the obstacles to doing these sorts of events.  They are as follows:<br>
Most people have not grouped with each other before<br>
Many have never done this particuliar event as yet<br>
We don't have an universial method of commnication that works well, just shout, ooc and say.<br>
The people do the organizing have only the little chat window to collect the information they need<br>
Everyone likes to, understandablely, do something while they wait.<br>
<br>
We can't respond to each person to acknowledge their presence and it is very possible that someone may be missed.  Recording people means fighting with a constantly scrolling chat window while recording peoples' names, after doing so the names are once more well up in your chat history.  <br>
<br>
I know when I have missed someone, the next time I remember and make an effort to insure they are not again overlooked.  So please, if you get missed on these remember its not your last chance ever and we do try our best.  Its another human behind that toon and is just as disappointed to have missed you as you were to be missed.  <br>
