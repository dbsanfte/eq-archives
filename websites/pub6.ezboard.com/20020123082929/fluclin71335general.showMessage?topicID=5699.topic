This was close second for me because I really liked this one because it had the &quot;My dog is dying&quot; sub story going on.<br><br>HOW LUCLIN CAN SAVE ME, AFGHANISTAN, AND OUR PLANET       <br><br>To the 'un-educated' I may seem to be a 'liar' or 'moron', however <br>with this plan I hope to show all of you how a single Christmas <br>present can possibly change the course of history. Firstly, I'd like<br>to point out that my dog needs a $29.99 brain surgery. However<br>since I am a poor man, I will not be able to save my dog unless I<br>were to 'somehow' receive a free copy of Luclin. This is because I<br>was beaten as a young child for my democratic and free world <br>opinions. My father, a devoted communist, claimed I was an enemy<br>of the people. I was traumatized. Therefore I require a daily dosage <br>of artificial happiness, according to my doctor. So I need to purchase<br>a copy of Shadows of Luclin because it is the only game in the local<br>Al’s Pawnshop. If I received a copy as a gift, then my dog’s life would<br>be spared. However, I do believe all companies are founded on greed<br>so I have worked out this equation to prove how the gift would<br>actually profit Verant Interactive:<br><br>9.99x-29.99=$p<br><br>X, the number of months a would play Everquest upon receiving Luclin,<br>we’ll say about for the rest of my life, since I will die without happiness,<br>so 70, 12 months in a year, makes x=840, $9.99, I believe the monthly<br>fee, multiplied by 840 would be about $8,392, subtract the cost of the<br>gift, $29.99, equals a total of $8,362 and one cent profit to Verant.<br><br>Who in their right mind would turn down an offer like that? Well, about<br>98.6% of citizens living in countries outside North America, because they<br>would most likely go bankrupt within 1 year, so it’s a good thing that I’m <br>not done…<br><br>How would this save Afghanistan?<br>Well, let’s say for every one hour of happiness I donate 1 cent to the <br>Afghan government, because I love how they overthrew the evil Taliban<br>with an American gun to their heads. Well, earlier I said I would play <br>for about 840 months, right? Well there are 30 days in a month and<br>24 ‘potential’ hours of happiness within them.<br><br>So, 24 multiplied by 30 by 840, $6,048 American dollars, or $6,048,000<br>in Afghan currency… or barely enough to pull their struggling country out <br>of the jaws of peril.<br><br>All right, Adam, you can save yourself, your dog, Verant, and the entire<br>nation of Afghanistan, but how will you save the planet? <br>Very carefully, No just kidding, actually quite quickly and carelessly. <br>While I play Everquest I like to eat large amounts of unnecessary candy,<br>most of this candy comes in plastic wrapping. Upon finishing each piece <br>of candy I will throw the wrapper out the window, instead of recycling it.<br>Not so fast! By doing this eventually, after 840 months, a large wastelands <br>will have formed between my house and the curb. The sight will bring tears <br>to activists and just people driving by, thus inspiring a great recycling revolution <br>among Americans, deeply moving the rest of the world to pitch in and do their<br>‘part’. Within 841 months the planet Earth will be saved from certain spontaneous<br>combustion due to pollution.<br>(Adam)<br><br>3rd Place goes to Mr. Germany (Finstermond Flammenmeer). Don't worry, I won't try to order McDonalds in Germany. I prefer Taco Bell anyway. BTW, I opened your entry up while I was at work. I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw your 'invention', and the two co-workers that saw it at the same time said that they would kill me if I didn't give you one of the copies. <br><br>4th Place goes to Alex P. Dude, you spend way to much time at the mall if you're homepoint is right outside the entrance to the mall.<br><br>Congratulations to everyone who won a copy of SoL. (I will be working on a page to get all entries up so that y'all can read them.) Please make sure y'all respond to the emails that I send out. As for James, please contact me ASAP so that I may get this out Friday to you before Christmas (Domestic shipping only for overnight delivery). If anyone does not respond to my emails within 10 days of my sending it out, I will have to choose another name from the list to send the copy out to, or use the cd's as coasters.<br><br>Reghis Philban  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ureghisphilban.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reghis Philban</A> at: 12/21/01 6:49:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzyce.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zyce</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wily Vulak Droppings</span><br>  Posts: 369<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/21/01 2:08:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5699.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Winners of free copy of SoL</span><hr size=1> shut up <p><center><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~dancaslr/zyce.jpg"></center><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=25754" target="_blank">Magelo Profile</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=5703.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=5687.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5699.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.emailToFriend?topicID=5699.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.threadControl?topicID=5699.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5699.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5699.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
