Except it was SINS (Sins Is Not ShowEq.) There was a GREAT advantage actually. Although I know it probably wasn't fair - and you couldn't really talk about it in game (or ban.) Most new items have built in light sources. So, as well as being able to see anything they have equipped, you can see a light source. So take for instance you're in umbral plains. It's not UBER gear, but to help even a small or decent guild get their members upgraded. Pulling a mob that shows a Light source, Any weapon, any equip, and knowing what type of mob you are pulling can even more define the type of armor it would drop. It also showed HP in a %, but you pull a mob with 5% or 12312931%, you get a higher chance. Either way, it was a REALLY cheap way to get ahead of the game, and even though in the simplist sense it was morally &quot;ok,&quot; because it was to help someone else - friends, guildies... it takes a lot of the adventure out of the game. <br>

This response is a huge load of rubbish. <br>

No where did Mantik mention someone's name or Guild by name to accuse. Being that this is the Flame Forum *should* not mean one is not accountable. He most certainly was not the one to make accusations.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1.3 - What information does ShowEQ actually show?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Anything that the EQ client knows, ShowEQ knows. This includes things like EVERY mob position in the zone, its level/class/race, items it is HOLDING which affect the way it looks, an accurate map of the zone, ground drops/spawns, traps... the list is very large. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1.9 - Can ShowEQ tell me what loot a creature will drop?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
More no than yes. The only information ShowEQ can display is that which the client receives. Loot info is not sent until the mob is actually looted. That being said, you can get a half decent idea if it is carrying something. An orc with a sword will probably drop some sort of sword. The shard wurms in GD that glow carry a light source, and that actually means they will drop the glowing bile. <br>

<br>
Interesting question, very little substance or real debate here where I was hoping thier would be, just the typical mud. In the history of EQ real cheating has been very contained to a few cases of duping plat and the recent case of transferring/selling no drop equipment. I would not put SEQ in that catagory. Back in the early days when it could tell you the loot on a mob I bet it made planes raids a lot less of a time sink for a few guilds. <p><p>
