<br>
In a nutshell, once your guild/alliance is capable of killing a mob (shown by killing it, on your own) you are entered into the rotation (on request).  This covers dozens of mobs in the game, and has been shown to have quite success.<br>
<br>
There is one rotational mob in particular that needs to be addressed today:  Dozekar the Cursed.<br>
<br>
Dozekar is a boss mob in the Halls of Testing, in ToV.  Killing him yields quest items, that eventually lead to fufilling various +CoV quests for various items.  In addition to Dozekar, the 'other fraction' of quest pieces are gained by killing the named drakes, in the Halls of Testing.<br>
<br>
Dozekar has been on rotation between TL and NB for well over a year - TL and NB laid out the rotational rules on this mob, and every entity who has entered the rotation has abided by these rules. <br>
 <br>
With that said, here are the rules:<br>
<br>
1) Dozekar and the named drakes are a package deal, and are to be treated as one rotational mob.<br>
<br>
2) You have 24h from spawn to kill Dozekar, and the named drakes, or you auto pass.<br>
<br>
3) To get admitted to the Rotation, you must successfully kill Dozekar the Cursed, without aid from an outside source.  (meaning if you are a single guild, you must kill Dozekar w/o invites, and if you are an alliance, you must kill Dozekar w/o invites)<br>
<br>
This is very straightforward, and simple to follow.  The underlying difference with the Dozekar Rotation, and other mobs is that the drakes are treated as the 'mob' for the rotation.<br>
<br>
This is because:  <br>
<br>
1) Doz/drakes are all on a ~7 day spawn.<br>
2) Without killing Dozekar, the drake symbols are useless to you.<br>
3) Without killing the drakes, the Dozekar tears are useless to you.<br>
<br>
So, as of late many guilds have been killing in the Halls of Testing, and some of these guilds have been killing the named drakes, but not Dozekar.  This is in violation of the Dozekar rotation (albeit I am willing to believe these violations are done in ignorance, rather than self-serving greed - e.g.: these rules needed to be posted publicly, which is what I am doing now!).  I would like to formally ask guilds *not* on the Dozekar rotation to please leave the named drakes up, for those who are on the rotation.<br>
<br>
Bear in mind, this rotation is set up to protect the spawns for the guilds on the rotation, making an already frustrating endeavour (the task of finishing these quests), a bit more palatable.  If you have plans for Dozekar (I can only assume the drake killers do), try to envision the hassle-free time you will enjoy when you are on the Dozekar rotation, by not killing off the drakes who are protected by a formal agreement. <br>
<br>

<br>
Bear in mind that in the fourteen months that Noble Blade has been killing Dozekar (Tindi started killing him a few weeks earlier), with roughly 40 kills (Lots of patch kills), we have completed 39 quests. <br>
<br>
Of the 60+ people we started with over a year ago, more than a quarter of those people have seen NOTHING for their time.  Silver symbols have been so rare for us that we haven't seen one drop since February, yet non-rotation guilds have been killing these mobs out-of-turn when they can't even use the symbols. Those guilds may think that by banking up symbols, they put themselves in a better position once they start killing Dozekar, and this may be the case, but it's incredibly disrespectful and unfair.<br>
<br>
Have some respect for the rotations, and if you need to pull in HOT at LEAST contact the rotation guilds and inform them that their rotation mobs are up.  We will have the same consideration for you when you are on the rotation.<br>

   I believe this is why the topic was started on the Flame forum... which lead to the posting of this topic in the first place as no where before did it *state* that those named were *part* of the Doze rotation. So Emil linked to this post from the Flame forum where it was brought up.<br>
   Tis also why i asked if there was a way to consolidate the 2 posts , as we now have folks posting here and in the flame boards upon the same subject, as the Flame forun is where this was 1st addressed *Officially*  <br>
  Just trying to stop some multiple cross posting and get all the beans in one barrel as some might say <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So All interested can discuss or rant or whatever in the same place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Courtesy of some trains and HoT door openings, ED got to do several mass CR's before we finally gave up and left. The Far Seekers got pushed aside on Friday (don't recall who they said did it) so they came back on Sunday and fairly beat ED to the HoT entrance...know what ED did? We didn't shove them out of the way. We didn't curse at them. We didn't train them out. We left TOV quietly and killed Vindi and UP names instead.

I realize that when Dozekar is up, people want a shot at him. But please just think about who made plans, who got up early, and who was in HoT first before you try moving in. And for cryin' out loud, if you do have to move in, DON'T train the other folks out. It just makes a bad situation worse, especially for the smaller guilds.

<br>
ToV can only be zoned into if you are level 46 plus. Sound familliar so far?<br>
<br>
Dozekar is a fairly difficult mob in the zone, which can really only be reached, if another guild is raiding for armor, by moving over that first guild. <br>
<br>
Anyone see where this is going?<br>
<br>
Just as you would not run over a guild in fear to get to cazic thule on your rotation day, shame on those who feel that because it is an easy run to doze's lair, that anyone in the way deserves to get pushed out, or pushed around. <br>
<br>
Try asking if the door is safe. Try understanding that other people were there first, and that frankly, if they let you run through their camp, they are doing you a favor.<br>
<br>
One very pleasent experience I can relate was how League of Levity handled the sharing of the Halls of Testing with us:<br>
<br>
They asked if we had intended to try dozekar, and finding that we were short clerics for the attempt, asked us to let them know when they could move through our camp. They told us any armor drops they had while moving to dozekar, or from adds in the fight with dozekar would go to us, then they would move to the areas with the named drakes, and that would get everyone out of each other's way. <br>
<br>
If only all guilds would be so considerate, frankly, the HoT would be a much less stressful area to raid in. <br>
<br>
I know, for a fact, that members of my guild cringe depending on who is up for dozekar on days that we raid in the HoT. <br>
<br>
Often for good reason. <br>
<br>
FCFS does not have the clause &quot;until a bigger guild runs in and wants a named mob&quot;. <br>
<br>
And as a side note: I couldn't support a rotation on gorenaire. Everyone and their dog would be on it if we did it retroactively, and if we didn't do it retroactively, you'd find small groups of people able to monopolize it all the same, but in this case with the guise of legitimacy by restricting the number of attempts someone could make to get on the rotation. <br>

/nitpick on.<br>
<br>
FYI, the door in HoT is meaningless.  The only thing doors affect in Everquest is whether or not a player character can run through them.  That's it. (well, they block archery and throwing weapons)  99.5% of the time, trains in HoT by the non-kos mobs on the other side of the door are the result of someone dragging a corpse that doesn't belong to them.  If anyone drags a corpse in ToV that doesn't belong to them, they will aggro any nearby mobs, independent of faction of the dragger and the faction of the corpse.  The only way to drag corpses their is by either running 5 steps forward, feigning, dragging, standing up, run 5 steps forward, rinse, repeat, or by dragging your own corpse.  For whatever reason, people choose to ignore this rule, and in the course of any given HoT raid you need to spam this warning over and over and over to not only the new invites but the people who have been to HoT 50+ times.  It's analogous to telling people to not bash PoH mobs up the wall and aggro'ing the second floor, or to not bash mobs onto firepots and/or trees, or to not attack the mezzed mobs.  You can ask every single individual member of the guild &quot;what did I tell you to not do 50 times?&quot; and each of them answer it right, but no matter what, every other time you go to hate you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> bash a mob up the wall and get trained, you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> get CT stuck in a tree, you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> get mobs stuck on firepots, banners, or stairs, and some fuktard <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> consent his cleric buddy and his cleric buddy <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> drag the corpse out of ae and train your ass to freeport.  The real insidious thing about this is for whatever reason, said cleric and said dead person really honestly didn't see &quot;DON'T DRAG IF YOU'RE NOT A MONK&quot; spammed into raid chat 40 times and is wondering who the queefstain is that opened the door and got the guild trained.<br>
<br>
But yeah, the door being opened or closed will not affect the dynamics of aggro, spellcasting LOS, melee, or NPC pathing in any way.  Not sure where the HoT door myth came from but I really wish it would go away.<br>
<br>
/nitpick off.<br>
<br>
Trains can also be caused by the ae of the HoT kos to all mobs in camp hitting one of the hub CoV aligned mobs, which would cause trains that are seemingly without reason.  We've run into problems once or twice with kos to CoV people being CoH'd up and getting hub aggro a few times. (though this hasn't been a problem any time recently since we hosed our CoV faction and kill all the hub mobs to get to HoT) <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

This is compounded because there are 3 mobs there, and one of them is named.  The other two mobs will assist the named (who is the one who will be hit w/ the AE), and that for most guilds who are camping the door area, rather than having moved in some, will be a wipeout.<br>

<br>
Thats why when NB was farmin HOT we moved in and farmed, there are spots you can farm from other then right at the HOT door, Back in the day when NB/tindi were farmin HOT so was KIC and some other guilds. HOT can support 2-3 guilds (no more) farming though if its a very accomplished guild they can clear more faster and share less but it is possible.<br>
<br>
As far as the doz rotation someone accused the rule as being &quot;new or made up recently to keep down the smaller guild&quot; <br>
<br>
This is False, DOZ/Named have always been linked , only recently have guilds been placed on the rotation and the word we --thought-- got past down, it obviously didnt to some. You can Ask KIC though they havent been on rotation (they autopassed since last year) for some time but I bet they remember the rule and it would put to rest the &quot;accusers&quot;.<br>
<br>
Another Thing is up until the last 2-3 months HOT has been relatively empty , now there is up to 12 guilds attempting HOT for better armor. We didnt pass down that named were part of a rotation because it up until now was a non-issue. Its like Blood of Ssra, he is on rotation but the details of the rotation are a NON-issue because it only concerns Tindi and Bots.<br>
<br>
Another thing compareing CT to Doz or hot isnt equal. CT is in a zone that is lagged by mass numbers and the entire plane is under a reservation, HOT can support mroe then one guild (72min respawn) then their is TOVN and TOVW, TOV west being able to sustain multiple armor farms as well.<br>
Haveing a Guild Camped at the HOT door for thier farmin is fine, but when DOZ and named are up a Guild can come in and kill them all with minimal issues ----IF---- the guild doing Armor farmin would learn to position themselves accordingly.<br>
<br>
Its kinda like SSra now, NB will be farming lvl 1 /2 key peices and Tindi will be doing High priest, we change our direction of pulls and move out of the way (incase of an accidental train). its part of a raid zone that is designed to hold many guilds.<br>
<br>
Fear was not designed to hold multiple raiding parties, it has a 12+ hour respawn. In my opinion the 2 are not comparable, but feel free to convince me otherwise. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upetruccib.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Petrucci B</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 10:13:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dozekar Rotation: an FYI</span><hr size=1> The HoT named and Dozekar spawn is pretty spaced out, I believe that named will be spawning on Thursday-ish and Dozekar around Sunday.

----IF---- the guild doing Armor farmin would learn to position themselves accordingly.<br>
============<br>
<br>
Are you saying, &quot;you should get out or our way?&quot; How should we position ourselves? to your tactics? should we just leave the zone? no. you should adjust your time, tactics and most of all be polite to the guild that is there before you.<br>
<br>
For guilds that are hunting HoT at the door, opening the door while they are fighting can aggro the drakes in the hub. (I have seen it). Your numbers can cause lots of people to go LD as well.<br>
<br>
You should ask nicely to move past them. You should talk to their puller so you know what has been cleared. Then you should move by without a fuss, quickly and quitely. Your late commers should be CoH'd past them. I have seen a guild move past one and then for about the next 20 minutes the door would randomly open and a person would run through. No concern about the issues they would cause while doing so.<br>
<br>
I also dont agree with the statement of &quot;we didnt need to tell you the rules because no one was hunting there&quot; Why did it come up now? There have been many guilds hunting in HoT for several months now. If you guys create a gentlemens agreement amongst yourselves, that is fine; dont expect all of us to agree to it. This governing body was set up as a voting group made up buy the guilds to operate for the guilds. Two or Three of you deciding what is best is not in the best interest for us all. We will probably agree to your requests, give the illusion of participation.<br>
<br>
I have also see the named drakes up without Doz. The guild I was in, we had cleared all the way to them and were looking for something to pull. Yep, we killed the named. When you look at the rot list and rules, nothing was wrong with that. (again an agreement between three guilds should not be binding upon the whole community here.)<br>
<br>
I'm not saying the named should be FFA or not, but that you decide to let us know how you have set up the rules and expect us to &quot;yes sir&quot; to them is BS. Ssra is an example, you will have guilds go there soon. You need to post what you expect of a guild that can go there before you whine that someone is breaking the RTA rules.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I think we should make the drakes on the same Rot list with Doz. The rot shoud be renamed to indicate this change. (yes it is a change).  I would agree that these  mobs should be combined because quests really suck. The drop rates for some items is insane and this will try to ease that.<br>
<br>
Maybe a read only forum that states what each rot is and the particulars about each rot can be set up to avoid such issues in the future.<br>

<br>
Yesterday (Sunday) as we were helping our clerics get shards for a possible ragefire attempt, I got a tell from a Tindi Losi (Egrim (sp?) if I recall correctly) member asking if we have been killing named drakes since they heard we have been. We've only killed the named drakes once and that was Saturday because Far Seekers was at HoT entrance.<br>
<br>
On Saturday when we went into ToV, Far Seekers was at HoT entrance and LoL was moving in, but they let us to take the zone out camp. As we were making our way towards the zoen out and into Doz's room, we saw that the named drakes were up. We are aware that named drakes are needed to finish the quests, but we DID NOT know that they were part of the rotation. Dozekar was not up, so we killed the named drakes.<br>
<br>
I've been playing this toon for roughly a year now, and I just found out about the RTA last Decemeber. I cannot speak for other officers, but as I read through the rotation stuffs, it was never stated that Named Drakes WERE part of the Dozekar rotation. Rules was, Dozekar was on rotation, and if you are on rotation you should not kill it until it's your turn. Now if the named drakes were part of a mutual agreement between NB/TL/BoTS before, than as guilds were put on the rotation or as Dozekar rotation was formed, they should have mentioned something about the named drakes. As far as I and other officers of SoY knew, named drakes were FFA just like any mobs in HoT. We did not think we were in any violation in anyway. Like I said, only thing mentioned about Dozekar rotation was Dozekar.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to get into any of the other arguments as to whether you should kill quests mobs before you can finish it or not. I'm just saying that if Named drakes WERE part of rotation, than make it known now so that it doesn't get confused. <br>
<br>
One suggestion if I may suggest. If there are any existing mutual agreements between NB/TL/BoTS that other guilds need to know about the higher end mobs (Arch Lich, AoW, Blood of Sshrazara, Burrower, Glyped, etc...) that you 3 guilds are only on, let us know now before this happens again in the future. Any mutual agreements should be laid out in the open where guilds can read and understand it, it doesn't matter if other guilds are not on the rotation yet, just make it known so that we don't make this mistake again.<br>
<br>
One last thing. Ever since I found out about RTA, I have respected the RTA rotation, and our members do respect the rotation. I just felt that we were in no violation on Saturday as we killed the named drakes.<br>

<br>
This may not concern alot of us today but look what just happened to the named drakes in HoT? Had there been a written rule to reference you bet my guild would not have touched those drakes. All guidelines that are to be part of the RTA rotation need to be written so that the newer guilds being added to the rotation can reference and follow said guidelines.<br>
<br>
While we're on the subject...who gets to come up with these guidelines? I'm not saying that 2000 people should be able to hash out the guidelines but their should be a handful of representatives from all walks of Norrath--that meaning not just the guilds who are on the rotations (P.S.

When only 2 (or perhaps 3) guilds are able to kill a certain creature, then a &quot;Gentlemen's Agreement&quot; seems adequate.  Really, only they know what is involved in killing the creature (and his cohorts, if any).  This also has the perk of letting them work out the nuances of this particular rotation quietly and thoroughly.<br>
<br>
It is the responsibility of the 2 or 3 large guilds to be continually looking behind them for those other guilds that may be ready, or close to ready, to enter the rotation.<br>
<br>
Once more than those 2 or 3 guilds start nearing the capability of killing those same creatures, then the agreement needs to be brought to ALL member guilds of the RTA to discuss and vote.  The best place to begin the discussion is with the then standing &quot;Gentlemen's Agreement.&quot;<br>
