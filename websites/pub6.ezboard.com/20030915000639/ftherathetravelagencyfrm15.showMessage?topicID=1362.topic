How long has he been back?   Don't know but from what everyone is saying he just came back recently. <br>
<br>
I knew Notouchie from way back in the day that the KC hand room was some of the best exp outside of Seb.  He was the shaman that would run in on us while invis and then melee each mezzed mob that was in the room while we exped there.  Same shaman that would train the room while we exped there, guess he wanted the camp huh.  So now he comes back after a break.  I read the multiple page flame on him and was like hmm, not enough there to condemn a man, hell he might have changed...lets give him the benefit of the doubt.  <br>
<br>
So I log in today and the guild has a group in MS of BoT.  I always 2 box my cleric and they had him there, I happened to log in right as cleric was killed so I got control of him back, was pretty cool actually lol.   So I bring Granitfist there and we continue exping.  About a hour later after I had gotten there and after the guild group had been there for about 5 hours, I saw someone pull a mob through the far side of the room.  Since I was unfamiliar with the camp I said in group that someone was on the far side out of the room but in the next room over pulling mobs.  They responded that it was the DS camp.  We had been killing the krigers and keeping the room cleared and alot of the surrounding area clear.<br>
<br>
Our tank was pulling and he pulled 2 and both clerics died and the tank.  We were running 8 toons there one cleric out of group.  So the Rogue runs the cleric's corpse to DS for rez, you know about 15 sec's away.  Get rezzed and all 3 monks were still in camp.  Run the clerics back.  The whole time there was a mininum of 3 monks in the camp and this whole CR took all of 5 min, ya I know its weak but they both died.<br>
<br>
I was running around the room a bit while the clerics medded back up and wham..almost ran into Notouchie pulling.  Hmm I said to myself I dont remember him being in DS camp.  I ran back to camp, as I was going to bring this up in group and wham our named popped.  What do I see 15 sec later?  Ohh there is Notouchie looking at the named, looks over at us and pulls the named.<br>
<br>
Now I call this pure and simple Bullshit because this distance from the named spot to where we set up camp was about the same distance that most people camp DS from the named.  There is absolutely no way you could miss us.  None.<br>
<br>
So I /ooc Get off our named Notouchie (or something like that)  Btw we had answered every Camp Check there was also proclaiming MS camp.  His group continued to kill the named and it happened to gate.  I have a nice screen shot showing where the named gated back to and our camp.<br>
<br>
Hmm what to do....well shiat I said its easy...Lets contact a LoM Officer....To my surprise and probably everyone else's surprise low and behold...I should give Notouchie a break pretty much because he just got there and doesnt know the camps but &quot;hes pulling for his group&quot;.....Ok lets think about this comment...He doesnt know the camps at all but hes pulling for his group, but take it easy on him...  Then its said well their group (not Notouchie) is saying that they didnt know you were there.  <br>
<br>
Ok so after calling MS to every camp check and almost running into Notouchie...and being within sight of their group and they were pulling through a cleared room.....they didnt have a clue that we were there...lol OOOO K<br>
<br>
So now that I said in OOC how shitty I thought this was, that group starts apologizing, about ... guess what at ...Notouchie...yep a few of his group was apologizing to me about his actions.  <br>
<br>
Then Notouchie apologizes...what do I get though....a load of shit, you can see this is evident though as.......From Notouchies mouth himself...I asked him what camp are you in atm...he replies immediatly &quot;MS&quot; ohh ok so HE does know what camp area hes in....then 41 seconds later he says...you got it, &quot;I dont know the camps, poor poor me I just got back from a break&quot;  <br>
<br>
Dude STFU with your weak ass excuses and playing dumb routine.  Its old, if people couldnt see it before they sure the hell should see it now, your nothing but a lying, conniving piece of shit.  You knew we were there, there is no way you could miss us, its not possible, you knew the camps, it took you 5 seconds to respond you were in MS camp.  You didnt say I am in MS1 or MS2..why??? Cause you knew it didnt exist, that was a pure and simple piece of shit lie.  My God dude wtf is your problem. <br>
<br>
Conculsion, this is the same old Ass of a Shaman that he has always been.  When he is caught at something he plays dumb.  I can remember at least 2 or 3 seperate flames on him before he took his break and now there is 2 more started on him.  Before LoM backed him 100percent....no matter what he did, why?  Cause he was a good shaman and his actions did not matter cause he was a good shaman.  Man step up and take responsibility for your actions and I challenge the LoM leadership to step up and take responsibility for your players next time.  Here is the log, I chopped a shit ton of the OOC and guild out, I can send them whole if that is prefered.  Also included is the screen shots.  Have a great day and watch out for Notouchie if hes around your camp.<br>

<br>
Weither or not the area is an actuall &quot;camp&quot; ( what makes them and official camp? ) or not, it still has been taken by a group.  If a group wanted to camp a single spawn point, by all means, that might not be an actuall &quot;camp&quot;, I'll still respect them though, and not take that spawn.<br>

I have seen Notouchie for 2 weeks now and have grouped with him several times . . .he always pulls<br>
<br>
I've seen him in south, DS, and MS . . . so he knows the area and he knows the camps<br>
<br>
If you look in a room and its empty except for a named and you havent pulled that room . . .then someone else is and you shouldnt pull that named . . . if you see 6 ppl in a corner (not hard unless your blind) that area is probably camped and its not right to pull a named mob from about 50 feet away. . . <br>
<br>
Any numbnuts can see 6 ppl in a corner . . . but 8 ppl?? how hard can it be to see 8 ppl in a corner . . . its common sense <br>
<br>
Notouchie is a good shaman and an ok puller . . . but he does very . . how should i put this . . reprehensible things<br>
<br>
He knew what he was doing yet he did it anyway . . .he needs to stop doing these things or take another break<br>
