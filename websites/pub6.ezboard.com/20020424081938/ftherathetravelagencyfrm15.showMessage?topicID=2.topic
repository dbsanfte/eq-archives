DELETE THE CALENDAR!!&quot; is not helping.<br><br>If you and your guild want FFA and you think you'll be ok with it, then just go FFA already.  But be ready to be in the same camp as people like Xenthor if the rest of the server isn't happy with that decision.<br><br>it looks to me like you want the calendar gone, but you just don't want to be the one to take the heat for turning the server FFA.<br><br>Either way, there are a lot of people doing what they can to make this work.

Have your guild go do what you want.  But I know and you know that the calendar system isn't dead.<br><br>Why else would you keep calling for its destruction?  If it was dead, nobody would respect the calendar, and you could safely FFA to your heart's content.  But ... apparently it isn't.<br><br>Maybe this little story (with names removed) will warm your heart a bit.  Who knows.  It's the story of a tiny guild with maybe 4 people in it who are planes capable.  A guild with no real ties to any of the uber guilds.  A guild with no way to really do any raids at all on their own.<br><br>A member of this guild got a chance to go to a plane, and went.  they had fun.  The next day, someone from another guild that was significantly larger and able to mount raids contacted them.  The offer was made to take the little guild on many planes runs, if the little guild would act as a front organization for posting rights on the calendar.<br><br>The little guild declined.  At the risk of potentially losing their one known invitation to planes/dragons/other raids.  And you know why they declined?<br><br>BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN THE CALENDAR.<br><br>If someone who has that much to lose can stand behind this calendar, I hope you will decide to work to fix the system, instead of trying to tear it down.<br><br>Bias Schmias<br>48th Warrior<br>Glossolalia<br><br>Disclaimer:  I am not accusing you or anyone from your guild of trying to be 'uber-uber' or 'ruin the server'.

If you knew inny was up for 2 days and did nothing to notify anyone of it are you not as much to blame as everyone else? Why was nothing posted? Look we can throw blame around all day BUT for anything to work it requires support on both ends of the spectrum. People are busting their butts trying to make this work and everytime you scream ffa it takes the appearance of an attempt to undermine all our efforts. The calender is in beta.

So i apologize for that. i agree with the big brother system.<br>Shoot me.<br><br>Stygar/Qwai, i respect you as a player, so dont take this personally, but everyone of your posts has to do with &quot;lets trash the calendar&quot; if you hate the calendar so much, offer a solution. Be part of the soluition, not the problem. <p><p>-------------------------------------------<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">Mikjo Wynterwolf</font></font><br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">Wanderer ofthe 53rd Circle</font></font><br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">Spokesdruid of the Crimson Fyre Alliance<font></font><br><font face="Wingdings"><font color="#000000"><font size=-2>the unkemptshall rise again</font></font></font><br>-------------------------------------------</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udarkoak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarkOak</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/13/00 3:04:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   :)</span><hr size=1> If the noob leader of CIW can't see that their isn't an Epic calendar or even a rule at the moment for BB guilds, he's two sandwiches short of a picnic.<br><br>I even went and checked to see if there WAS anyone posted on the Epic Calendar. The only name on their was KEG, and that was for PoA.<br><br>How hard is it for you to do a /tell to person in Hate..<br>'Heya, how goes the raid?  Do you have enough for Innie/Maestro, and/or plan to kill them?'<br>&quot;No, we don't have enough for them.&quot;<br>'Ok. Are you almost done in Hate?'<br>&quot;Yeah we have about 20 minutes left.&quot;<br>'Ok cool.'<br><br>The alliance I'm in is not even listed in the BB bit, yet I usually like to find out if the current guild in the plane after the server just came back up was able to kill X God / mob, or will be able to.<br><br>For now, the onus of finding out is on you Stygar, and the other BB guilds/alliances, until everyone knows about and the majority agree to the current rules. Even after the finalization, etc a quick /tell to whoever's in X plane can usually yield a lot of information about how the raid is progressing.<br><br>If you don't like the small responsibility of finding out from X guild if they will be able to kill the 'boss' mobs of said plane, then perhaps the BB troupe isn't for you.<br><br>As for seeing to the deletion of the calendar? Maybe far off in the future it will need to be revised, possibly dismantled, but we aren't there yet.<br><br><br>Now onto Sirth and company. I spoke with Sirth and Rogfear a fair amount, and according to them, had received a login/password from Aegirson. They also claimed to have enough planeables to post a raid. Which I couldn't really fathom, until finding out they had somewhat of an alliance with Intrepid Spirit and possibly other guilds/organizations. Which gave them maybe 20 planeables tops. But they don't seem to want to post that they are allied with Guild Y and Z anywhere, which seems somewhat suspicious.<br>So, I'll ask you, who was in Sirth and company that went into Hate last night to try and grab Innie/Maestro from (obviously) CIW?<br>I wasn't there so I don't know who was in the Plane, were you there? Was a member of the previous nights guild there? Sirth and company did have Hate last Thursday night, perhaps they had camped out for whatever reason or only some did and the rest gated?<br><br>Right now the only thing we have is you receiving reports from ESP about Sirth and company 'sneaking' into Hate last night. They may very well have been there. What were there intentions? Did Sirth or Rogfear themselves say they were going to grab Innie/Maestro? Or was it an interpretation? They are in Hate! They must be going to kill Maestro/Inny.<br><br>Hmm. Anyways.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Darin DarkOak<br>&quot;The above is my own, not my guilds stand/viewpoint.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubiasschmias.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bias Schmias</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/13/00 3:28:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: part of the problem, redux</span><hr size=1> <br>Ok, last thing i'll say and then i'll try to not post much more in this thread if i can help it.<br><br>Aegirson:  by continuing to threaten FFA but not actually doing anything, you are part of the problem.  You are undermining the work that is being done RIGHT NOW to keep the calendar going.<br><br>I agree, it sucks you couldn't get help six months ago to keep the calendar running and make things better.  That bites.  6 months ago, I was a lowbie who didn't even know what the hell KEG was, except a thing you put beer in.<br><br>I want to thank you for taking on the thankless and unenviable task of trying to run the calendar system for as long as you have.  But do you really want to tear down what you've worked so hard to maintain?  I don't know you, or your guild, or anyone on this board in-game.  And yet, I think highly enough of your current &quot;broken&quot; calendaring system that I'm risking losing my one invitation i've gotten to a plane raid by standing up for it.<br><br>Isn't that worth preserving, Aegirson?  <br><br>All I am saying to you, to all of CIW, to BOTS, to KEG, to everyone who reads this messageboard:<br><br>State your intentions.<br><br>If you are going to go FFA because you are fed up with the calendar and you honestly don't believe it will work anymore, DO IT.<br><br>if you are just honestly sick of working on the calendar, but think it could work if someone else were to run it, and would support whatever decisions were made without your input, SAY THAT.<br><br>If you want to have a hand in making the calendar better and you aren't totally burnt out yet, DO THAT.<br><br>It is your (in my eyes) lack of commitment in either direction at this point that is what makes you &quot;part of the problem&quot;.<br><br>I hate that choice of words, because it turns this into an even more combative discussion than it already is.  ugh.<br><br>All I think anyone wants at this point from you, or from Stygar, or from anyone else who has been espousing FFA every time something goes wrong lately is for you to make a stand. <br><br>Make a stand, make it public, and live with your decision.  Even if your stand is to stop providing input into changes and enforcement of rules.  Even if you choose to plunge the server into FFA and (imho) chaos.<br><br>Pick a side, and start swinging.  Choose which one you truly believe in, and fight to the bitter end, or the triumphant conclusion.  Or both.

Qwai, perhaps you'd care to give some input?<br><br>Aegirson, when you asked 6 or 8 months ago for assistance, I said that I would.  When you asked 2 months ago for assistance, I again offered mine.  You took on a world of shit to uphold the calendar set up almost a year ago, with very little support, and I applaud that effort, and have offered over the months to share that burden so that it was not quite so heavy.
