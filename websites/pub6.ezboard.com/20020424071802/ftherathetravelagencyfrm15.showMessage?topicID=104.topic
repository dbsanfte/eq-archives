I was hesitant at first, since I knew absolutely no one in the guild.  After the breakup of my last guild, I wanted something better.  I was getting invites to several guilds, but I wanted to try something new.  Xedd kept harassing me often to join, telling me of the great bard loot I would be getting, what dropped in some plane today for bards that they had to destroy and so on.  LoM seemed to have a good reputation and I wanted to go on raids, so I chose to join LoM.<br>     After joining, I attended raids almost daily and faithfully for 3 weeks.  It was during the time that the servers were having problem and were down almost daily, so epic quest mobs were up everywhere.  Everyday I logged in, I found out where LoM was and did what ever it took to get myself to where they were at so I could help out.<br>     The first day was okay, a few people made me feel welcome, mostly just Xedd and the induction officer.   Since LoM is raid-orientated, we are expected to attend raids whenever we are online.  I play EQ often, so everyday I was logging on and doing whatever it took to get to where ever these guys were raiding.  This required a lot of traveling and gchat would be full of requests for ports.  Whenever I asked for port or anything other information, I was generally ignored in chat.  I attended anyways, finding my own means to get to where I needed to be on time.<br>     Once I got to the raid, I would turn lfg on as requested and start trying to get into a group or listen to groups being form, hoping I would be included.  Mostly I was ignored and had to solo.  A few times, when mana was needed, I was invited to a group, then dumped solo again once they were all FM.  Its kinda dangerous for a bard to go solo and group-less in planes and many of these high level dungeons, but I didn’t complain excessively, just tried to find a group and help-out where ever I could.  Once the raid was over, people and groups would start porting out and I would be begging for someone to take me with them.  Few places I was left to find my own way out.   It got so bad that I felt I needed to keep a gate potion with me at all times with LoM.  I’m a bard…we don’t get gate or teleport.<br>     For 3 weeks, I followed LoM like this, feeling rather alone and left out.  I tried everything I could to get notice and make friends to no avail.  The only comments people would make to me were how I was there just to pickup loot for bards that would rot.   I felt like a garbage man for LoM after a bit of hearing this enough, following these ‘ubers’ and picking up the trash they leave behind.<br>     When chasing epic mobs, nothing for bards ever drop anyways.  In that time I was with LoM, the only bard loot that dropped, that I received, was a dark wood piccolo and bard plane armor bracer.  Both items are not uber loot.  The piccolo is just an instrument for bards and bard plane armor is crappy, my cheap Ry’gorr chain is way better.  Just look at the quality and quantity of drops other classes get.  Bards don’t really get much but crap anyways that I have seen.  This is a fact about bards I have long ago learned to accept.<br>    The only reason I join LoM or any guild is to feel part of something, accepted, and make friends.  I am or never was after loot or anything of sorts.  I am not greedy and Korsen’s gear shows it.  I don’t have a single item on him more than a few Kpp and all my gear I own could probably be traded for a FBSS.<br>    But I do feel that anyone or I should be justly rewarded for their hard work and loot distributed fairly.   Anyone who knows me knows that I’m a hard and stubborn about being fair and just.  I felt the piccolo justified the 3 weeks of time I given to LoM attending raids, paying for ports to get to location of raids, and all the expensive gate potions I bought.<br>    So, I wasn’t felt too welcome with LoM.  It may take these guys a bit longer to warm up to me.  But after 3 weeks, I expected to fell a bit more welcome, though.  Some groups of people are like that, I guess they feel someone new needs to prove themselves, or pass some sort of initiation.   I’m not like that, I welcome new people always and give them the benefit of doubt.  No one ever has to prove anything to me, I accept people as they are and judge them by their actions.  And I fit in with people better with that attitude.<br>    I left LoM because I did not feel I fit in with them.  I explained my reasons rationally on their forum just as I did here for leaving.  Guess Xedd didn’t except my reasons, because I was immediately flamed and accused of joining entirely to get loot.<br>   I had also decided to just retire Korsen and play some alts, since playing him has just been too depressing.  But since I have left LoM, every time I log on Korsen, I get harassed by Xedd or some other officer of LoM for leaving.<br>     Recently, they have begun to accuse me of ‘stealing’ the piccolo they asked me to loot in Fear off one of the golems while guilded with LoM.  I was the only bard in attendance to that raid that I was expected to attend as a member of LoM at the time.  The piccolo is a common bard only drop in Fear, has no displayed stats and is simply a bard only instrument.  It was also the only item I received, that I could use after attending 3 weeks of required LoM raids other than a no drop bard only plane bracer that joins the other one rotting in my bank.  <br>    The moment I log in Korsen to work on a quest for an alt or try to play Korsen for a bit, I begin to receive harassing tells from Xedd or other LoM officers accusing me of being a thief and to return the piccolo.   If I am not /anon, Xedd follows me to what ever zone I’m in and group I have joined to continue harassing me publicly and demanding the piccolo.  They also have posted on their private forums, inviting their members to continue to harass me for the piccolo and for leaving.<br>    Now the piccolo in question, I gave away the day I left LoM.  I gave it to a newbie bard friend of mine that needed a decent wind instrument.  I figured since I was retiring Korsen, he would have more use than me and his joy of receiving the piccolo was enough reward and compensation for me enough.   I will not ask him for the instrument back.  It is not right to ask back what was given freely as a gift and without expectations.<br><br><br>I am stating now publicly on this forum to Xedd and those of LoM harassing me:  <br><br>   If you, Xedd, or anyone else continues to harass Korsen, I will immediately stop what ever I am doing, leave to a safe place, and begin /petition GMs and continue to do so, until the matter is totally resolved.<br><br>  You guys DO NOT intimidate me and I WILL NOT allow you to continue to harass, bash, and spread rumors about Korsen.<br>  <br>  And I am not interested in any epic item or any loot that makes people just resent me for.  That’s not why I play EQ or join any guild with any of the characters I play.<br><br>- Korsen Solosong <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvincecross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vincecross</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 252<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/22/01 9:54:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: To Xedd and LoM:  Cease harassing me.</span><hr size=1> /ignore,<br>/anon,<br>/petition <p><p><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left">Vincecross Dhark'baen 55 Necromancer <br>Vincecrs Dhark'baen 46 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugorgash.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gorgash</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/22/01 10:31:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: To Xedd and LoM:  Cease harassing me.</span><hr size=1> I agree with Vince.<br><br>Use your ignore list and petition any overt harrassment.

All I can say is keep the piccolo I don't care man just get a nice reality check because the story you told was an over dramatization filled with some things that happened like you not fitting in with LoM and the like and things that did not happen at all like my going to the zone you were in and badgering you and your group. <br><br>Oh well if you reached anyone with your slandering me congratualtions I'm going back to deal with more important things now.<br><br> <p>Xedd Zerous<br>Tactical Masta Legend of Marr<br>Revenant of da ghetto<br>"Buy me bonestorm or go to hell!'"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxeddrc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xedd RC</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif  BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LOM</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/22/01 7:55:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Answers to non korsen posts.</span><hr size=1> Everyone who said /petition /ignore /report.<br>I agree 100%<br><br>Slitz:<br>In LoM we like to have fun we say hi to people and such but we don't just start including people in things we talk about because, we don't know what to say to them. Infact its because of this korsen incident that we changed our induction policy. You see our old policy was apply wait hang out a little bit you get in. This left a lot of people who would get in not knowing anyone and the like and when they left it was understandable. We welcomed Korsen with open arms just the same way we welcomed everyone else, with a smile and a &quot;hi&quot; and an open mic to say whatever you want.<br><br>Deeznutz:<br>Nice flame, I think? or was it just more recycled trite put downs that you've used like 100 times already. <br><br>Banisher:<br>Yup you bet the beginning members of LoM were a couple of people from Righteous heroes and some people from Edgedhonor. What did we persue? A good time and thats what were all having, when you have a big guild and an attitude like ours its not about loot its about having fun but, for some of us the best way to have fun is to persue the higher aspects of the game then just attaining levels. Were just a guild of people who like to play EQ. Were not an uber guild were not a guild that can do nothing were a bunch of people who enjoy doing things together and we get better as it as we do more things together and more people join our guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>And finally, Korsen I'm sorry you fell through the cracks and LoM just wasn't for you.

In our guild (as I thought was pretty standard with most), if you can use it and you are given permission to loot it, it's yours, NOT guild property unless stated VERY CLEARLY at the time.  Besides we often have &quot;guests&quot; on our raids that only one or two people know (if that even) and they have rights to loot also (may not be exactly equal, hosting guild often gets first crack at loot, then guests but no loot rots if SOMEONE can use).  Basic rule is:  If you attend the raid you have more right to loot than someone who did not (in the case of items that are NOT no drop).  If someone later leaves the guild, we don't ask them to return loot they got on raids with us.  But then we try to be careful when recruiting so we don't get people who only join us in order to get one or two items in particular (and new members are down the list of loot order--no new druid will be awarded a verm bp over a druid that has been in the guild for several months etc.).<br><br>And 9 or 10 tells can be considered &quot;harassing&quot; depending on the content and if the person has requested you cease sending them tells.  If Xedd sent 9 or 10 tells and two other officers/members of LoM sent a few tells each, I can understand how Korsen could get a bit pissed.<br><br>Sabelle<br>Ranger in Service to Tunare<br>The Rathe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usolareesmarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solarees Marr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Legends of Marr</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/23/01 2:11:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: To Xedd and LoM:  Cease harassing me.</span><hr size=1> OMG, Korsen having 2 pity posts at once?<br><br>Let me fill the rathe community in on ur saintly ways since you obviously left out some details<br><br>1) If you have a problem with harrassment, take it up with a GM and dont try dragging an entire guild into it when its only 1 or 2 people involved. They can have that person banned if you provided the necesarry logs. If youre qualm is with Xedd, then do the rest of the guild a favor and leave us out mmkay?<br><br>2) Arent you missing a detail here with your pity post?<br><br>Korsen was awarded the piccolo under the assumption that he needed the item. Mind you he did not say anything but a Thank you to the guild when he was told to loot it. What we found out AFTER he left the guild was that he ALREADY HAD the item and took the 2nd one REGARDLESS. LoM at the time had 2 bards on the roster, Korsen and Reighn, the latter being only 43 but had no item nowhere near the quality of the Piccolo and clearly needed it. Korsen took the piccolo knowing full well he had one already, probably in the hopes of selling it for phat cash or giving it away for cybersex fav0rs. The RIGHT thing to do was tell us that he had one already and we wouldve given it to Reighn (our other bard) who could clearly USE the item. The WRONG thing to do was to take it away from our other bard for personal gain by taking the item despite the fact he had one already.<br><br>Now when i confronted him with this, he DID in fact tell me had the same picollo already and confirmed it, and also told me that he gave away the one he received from our raid (most likely a lie). Now, if there is someone else in the guild who clearly needed the item why would u deprive them the chance to receive it which is clearly what Korsen did and DID so RIGHT after he received the picollo by choosing to leave the guild? Under my personal assumption, he left the guild in an attempt to get away with it and was nothing but greedy. If he didnt leave the guild I wouldve booted him out myself regardless knowing what I knew after the fact.<br><br>Now lets see. He already had a Piccolo. He took the 2nd one anyway when we had another bard who needed it. No, he didnt tell us that he had one already until AFTER he left the guild in a poor attempt to gloat over pulling a &quot;good one&quot; over us.<br><br>Next time you want praise Korsen, make sure u include all the facts. You may be nice to strangers on the rathe but deep down ur just another greedy prick looking for attention. Now do LoM a favor korsen and stop harrasing US and our guild boards with your copy-and-paste posts that dont even have half the facts and get on with ur life. Go make a Jackass video if you want attention. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrulnick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grulnick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/23/01 4:24:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: To Xedd and LoM:  Cease harassing me.</span><hr size=1> /sarcasm on<br>/asshole on<br>/smartass on<br><br>Funny how people never wait to hear all sides of a story before they react.<br><br>Sabelle, Thank you for informing us how your guild works; however I really don't give a damn how your guild works, but thanks anways.<br><br>Just because Korsen wasn't up to par with the rest of us.
