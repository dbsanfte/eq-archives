If you have the balls to take the middle south camp... be prepared to keep up with your spawns.  You never know when DS or LS are going to add dps to their groups and decide they can start pulling more.<br>

MS is not a camp in there eyes. Therefor its ok that they took the mob seeing as how you were camping something that is not allowed to be camped. Next time I would hope you would be smart and 'considerate' enough to have your group wait till notouchie and gang sign on and send them a tell asking their permission to camp somewhere. How disrespectful of you not to check with the all knowings first geez. What? You thought you had the right to have opinions and kill anywhere you wanted to kill outside of rotational mobs just because you are the first ones there? Pfft, dream on. And even if they allowed you to camp there, you were not able to pull him yet. You were not set up. They were. Oh you thought there was honor and respect for others takin into consideration in those cases? LOL Dream on again. Only the strong survive baby. And I swear to God if anyone else gets onto Notouchie about anything, proof or no proof I'm going to flip. What don you people understand...he didn't play the game for a period of time. It doesn't matter if he does know the camps, or if he has been back a month or so (which if he was such a great skilled player doesn't mean he should be able to pick up a game he played so much and be able to deal with minor changes in the game within a month..) so get off his case. Your all just made he gets the phat loot and you don't! Would you send a criminal back to jail for shooting someone if he had just got out of jail having spent 3 whole months there? Hell no, he didn't realize what he was doing, you have to give him time to get use to how things work again geez have some respect. <br>

Notouchie wasnt in DS or S, Notouchie and group set up their own MS camp, after Granit and his friends had been there for several hours.<br>
<br>
Obviously this other group felt that MS was a camp, or they wouldnt have set up camp there...so...<br>
<br>
They were completely disrespectful because they didnt recognize or respect the group that was there.<br>
<br>
If they had been in S or DS and Notouchie pulled this, you could say MS isnt a camp and isnt respected by S or DS, but, the other group was camping MS too.<br>
<br>
It really doesnt matter what other people think about MS or DS or S or West or East or whatever, all that is of importance is that the opposing group, (Notouchie's group), feel that MS is a camp, so they camped it.<br>
<br>
The problem is there was someone already there, so they disrepected them and stole their named. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slimenimsoy@therathetravelagency>SlimenimSoY</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/22/03 2:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1362.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Repo man</span><hr size=1> I meant someone from LoM that means a fook, not just anyone from LoM.

<br>
All mobs are FFA til engaged.  There is no camping in EverQuest as stated bythe EULA.  I understand the rules.<br>
<br>
But after playing for 4 years, I've learned to gain a certain amount of respect even for people I don't know, because somewhere in the past someone who didn't know me, respected my camp.  Its called the Play Nice Policy.  Apparently this is more of a yield sign than a stop sign tho.  Those who don't play nice can continue to do so without any GM or Guide stopping them.<br>
<br>
Notouchie isn't breaking the law, but I don't think that proving he broke any EQ laws is the point of this thread.  The point is Notouchie did something disrespectful.  Notouchie walks on a pretty thin line of what is right and wrong.  In the GMs eyes, he would say that Notouchie did nothing wrong, that he engaged the mob first and yes because so it was his groups kill.  Ok so we finally all admit, Notouchie broke no rules of the EULA.  But I think over the last 4 years, EverQuest players have all created a mutual &quot;SOP&quot; manual of our own.  Notouchie just simply does not follow this manual, even know he knows it all too well.  Notouchie rides by the seat of his pants, singing the song of glory that he can wreak havoc in EQ all he wants, and there isn't a damn thing anyone can do about it.  There are more people on the server that dislike him than there are of people who do like him.  This only makes him want to wreak even more havoc.  He feeds on threads like this for breakfast unfortunately. <br>
<br>
Alot of people say oh its just a game.  6 HOURS PEOPLE.  I don't care how much of a game this is.  If you camp something for 6 hours, you expect to atleast have a chance at getting what you came there for.  Lets say I like to work on cars as a hobby.  I have an old 57 Chevy chasy that I work on on the weekends.  Even tho its not running yet, and even tho its just a hobby, if someone came and stole it from my drive way, I'm not just going to so oh fuck it.. Thats a bummer..  I've put HOURS into that car..  I don't care how much of a hobby it is, it has alot of sentimental value.<br>
<br>
I would blame Notouchie because he was the one that made the ultimate and final decision to pull that mob.<br>
<br>
Shit this is long enough.  Have fun guys!  Hope u get over this quickly Granit.  Notouchie, the Dennis Leary of EverQuest isn't going away I don't think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slimenimsoy@therathetravelagency>SlimenimSoY</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/22/03 2:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1362.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> Let me explain what I meant by &quot;means a fook&quot; BTW<br>

Expand your lungs, inhale air. Hold for 2 seconds or so. <br>
Release. <br>
