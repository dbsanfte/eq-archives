In some he sees looks of admiration,<br>
                      in others, fear. Looking through the crowd he spies a few that look bored, anxious to<br>
                      be doing something else. He notes their location so he can see how they react to<br>
                      the lesson he plans to deliver.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Hello, I am Krowbarr.&quot; All mumbling ceases in an instant with these words. The<br>
                      sense of the crowd is now not unlike a classroom. &quot;I have been asked to speak to<br>
                      you who would call yourselves Gemchopers. You will listen when I speak and you will<br>
                      answer any questions quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
                     &quot;What does it take to be a Gemchoper?&quot; Krowbarr asks the group.<br>
                      &quot;It takes Courage!&quot; Says a young Gnome sitting up front.<br>
                      &quot;It takes Honor!&quot; Says another nearby.<br>
                      &quot;It takes Strength!&quot; Says one close to the rear.<br>
                      &quot;You must be fearless!&quot; answers one who looked freighted when the assembly<br>
                      began.<br>
                      &quot;Stop, You, fearless one stand up.&quot; Demands Krowbarr, looking angry and slightly<br>
                      tired. <br>
                      The young gnome near the middle of the group stands up, sweat beading on his not<br>
                      yet balding brow. &quot;What are you doing here if you think a warrior must be without<br>
                      fear? And what is your name.&quot; Krowbarr asks the nearly quivering gnomeling.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;I am Morls sir. Warriors are brave; they do their duty and protect their friends.<br>
                      Surely they cannot do that without fear. I want to learn how.&quot; Morls finishes his<br>
                      statement weakly, wishing he could sink back into the crowd.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;You will know fear. From the moment you leave this blessed city to the day you are<br>
                      put to eternal rest you will know fear. The ones who don't will not survive Steamfont<br>
                      much less the greater world beyond. Fear will be a constant thing, like eating and<br>
                      sleeping. Fear will be a part of your everyday life. Oh yes, you will know fear. Until<br>
                      the day you sink your blades into Cazic Thule you will know fear. And on that day,<br>
                      you will know fear most intimately.&quot; Says the Gemchoper; a glimmer of joy passes<br>
                      over his face remembering when he heard that last bit as a young gnome.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;But how can we do our duty if we are afraid?&quot; Asks one of the front row group, his<br>
                      face puzzled now.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Fear is a tool to be used. Fear warns us when danger is near. Fear prompts us to<br>
                      action. Fear propels us when it is time retreat.&quot; A smile crosses Krowbarr's face, the<br>
                      whole group sits in rapt attention.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Fear is a tool to be used. It only becomes deadly when it uses you. You will know<br>
                      fear, but you MUST know how to use it rather than be used by it. Fear will use you<br>
                      by causing your brain to freeze up and lead to inaction, this will get you, and your<br>
                      friends killed. Fear will try to use you to make you run instead of fight. You must not<br>
                      become a tool of fear.&quot; The class sits motionless; the sound of breathing is the only<br>
                      sound that can be heard. A thought passes through the Gemchopers mind about how<br>
                      much fun it would be to yell 'Boo!' right now and see who scatters.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Not all of you will learn how to use fear. Only a very few will ever become<br>
                       Gemchopers. Of those who do, not many will ever leave Steamfont or Fedwer. On a<br>
                      good night throughout the world there will be but 10 Gemchopers fighting on any of<br>
                      the four known continents. You will find yourselves fighting alongside a wide variety<br>
                      of races.&quot;<br>
<br>
                      &quot;You will likely team up with creatures whose very friends and family consider gnome<br>
                      a delicacy.&quot; Krowbarr pauses, the group shocked and mumbling to each other. &quot;You<br>
                      will also find that many of the females of any given race think we are truly special&quot;<br>
                      He says with a knowing grin. &quot;Barbarians will want to pick you up and throw you at<br>
                      the enemy, Erudites and High elves will somehow make you feel that looking down on<br>
                      you is a negative thing, not a given. Dwarves will learn to respect you in battle, and<br>
                      you will be welcome within the city of Rivervale as if it were your own home.&quot; A sigh<br>
                      escapes Krowbarr's throat before he can catch it. &quot;And you will come to think of the<br>
                      companionship of another gnome as a special occasion.&quot;<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Morls, does that frighten you?&quot; A quizzical glance at the still standing gnome lets<br>
                      him know he should answer promptly.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Aye sir, it does.&quot; Morls answers weakly.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;It should. Will you be leaving now? I understand there are still applications being<br>
                      taken at the other schools.&quot; Krowbarr asks sincerely.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Nay sir, I will not let my fear send me away.&quot; A hint of self summoned courage<br>
                      drifting through his words. Krowbarr nods and indicates that Morls might sit down. A<br>
                      gnome in the front row that had looked so eager to please in the beginning raises his<br>
                      hand.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Yes boy, you have a question?&quot; Krowbarr asks.<br>
                      &quot;Aye sir, I don't think I am Gemchoper material. I, I don't ….&quot;<br>
                      &quot;You may leave. Seek out the Clockwork Administrator he will see to it that you are<br>
                      placed appropriately. If any of you think at this time that you do not wish to become<br>
                      a Gemchoper, please go now.&quot; Krowbarr says, many of the class get up and leave to<br>
                      pursue schools of magic. From a group of near fifty potential trainees, fifteen remain.<br>
<br>
                      Krowbarr sits on the edge of the raised platform, grabs a jug of Gnomish Spirits and<br>
                      takes a long drought.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Now we get down the nuts and bolts of it I think.&quot; Krowbarr surveys the remaining<br>
                      group. Of these he can still see two of the bored ones, and young Morls. He sits<br>
                      silently waiting on a cue that he knows will soon come. Memories of his youth when<br>
                      he was not asked to train but made to by the King run through his head. He knows<br>
                      that in this group, perhaps four will become Gemchopers, and of those, maybe one<br>
                      Will survive his fifteenth level of training. He waits that ones voice.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Pardon me sir, but is the speech over?&quot; Asks one of the bored looking gnomes<br>
                      Anxious to doing anything other than sitting here in silence.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;What is your name boy?&quot; Krowbarr asks sounding irritated.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;I am Dryl sir.&quot; Responds the impatient one.<br>
<br>
                     &quot;Dryl why do you wish to become a Gemchoper?&quot; Still sounding irritated, Krowbarr<br>
                      glowers at the young gnome.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Sir, I could tell you I want to defend Steamfont and a number of other things, I<br>
                      could go to mage training, my aptitude is good enough for that, but I like action.&quot;<br>
                      Says Dryl.<br>
<br>
                      Krowbarr nods then motions for Dryl to sit down. &quot;I will continue in a moment Dryl,<br>
                      you must learn some patience.&quot; Inside of Krowbarr a chuckle remains suppressed.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Morls, why do you wish to become a Gemchoper?&quot;<br>
                      &quot;Sir, I wish to honor Ak'anon and defend people.&quot; Responds Morls, having overcome<br>
                      his fear.<br>
<br>
                      Krowbarr nods again then tells the remaining group &quot;You will all go visit with Manik in<br>
                      the Warriors guild, he will issue you a sword. Meet me at the opening to Steamfont<br>
                      in one hour. If there are any among you that are having second thoughts, I suggest<br>
                      you take your leave at this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
                      After a lengthy discussion with Manik and others within the Gemchopers guild<br>
                      Krowbarr begins his walk toward the exit of Ak'anon. Knowing that the youngsters<br>
                      had all gotten there sword, and received a training pack that includes bandages and<br>
                      some small rations he feels confident that today he will find at least two who will<br>
                      become Gemchopers, and a couple that will go on to another noble trade.<br>
<br>
                      Passing the majestic waterfall he looks down the long corridor that leads to the exit.<br>
                      To no great surprise he sees a young gnome running his way.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Stop boy!&quot; Krowbarr says in his best commanding voice. The youngling in question<br>
                      all but trips over himself trying to come to an abrupt stop.<br>
                      &quot;I can't do it sir, I thought I could but I just cant. I looked outside sir, it is vast and<br>
                      there is no cover from the sun. I can't go outdoors sir. I can't.&quot; Said the now<br>
                      sobbing youngling. A frown crosses Krowbarr's lips, this one might have had promise<br>
                      for another trade, but will instead be made a mechanic to keep the Clockworks<br>
                      running.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Very well. Return your things to Manic. He will redirect your training.&quot; Krowbarr tells<br>
                      the youngster in an even and measured tone. As he returns to walking for the exit,<br>
                      he thinks to himself. &quot;Well, now there is fourteen of fifty left. Before this day is<br>
                      done, I suspect two to four will be ready for there next round. At least my part in<br>
                      there training will be at its end soon.&quot;<br>
<br>
                      The small gathering of young gnomes are busy playing and chatting with the<br>
                      Watchmen outside entrance. From where he is now standing Krowbarr can hear<br>
                      things like &quot;Wow! You can remember when Krowbarr made his first trip out here? Was<br>
                      he scared?&quot; Krowbarr chuckled at the response from Nylz . The answer was part<br>
                      fiction, part truth, but told in a way that made Krowbarr look like he was a master of<br>
                      arms on his first trip out. <br>
<br>
                      Krowbarr looked over at the Clockwork spider awaiting the faint noise that would tell<br>
                      him it was one hour to the precise second from when he left them to gather there<br>
                      gear. When the sound came he strode out the passageway as if going to fight<br>
                      something very large and deadly. Stopping only briefly to salute the three watchmen<br>
                      (Nylz had come away from his post to see the youngsters.) Krowbarr ordered the<br>
                      youth to assemble.<br>
<br>
                      Precision is expected out of Gnomes in general, and even without training, all but<br>
                      one of the present youngsters fell in together like seasoned troops. The one who<br>
                      didn't was one of the 'bored ones' that Krowbarr had noted earlier during the lecture.<br>
                      There is no room for sloth or stupidity in the world of a Gemchoper. For this one, the<br>
                      day was over. &quot;It is time for you to return inside. See the Clockwork administrator,<br>
                      you will be re-assigned.&quot; Said Krowbarr, his voice one of command. Without a word<br>
                      the slow one stalked back inside. Never meeting Krowbarr's eyes. Beyond a doubt<br>
                      that one would find his way to the mines of malfunction, or perhaps a life of crime.<br>
                      With a shrug of disappointment, Krowbarr looked at his assembled group of<br>
                      youngsters.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Today I will teach you the rudimentary forms of sword usage. After that, you will be<br>
                      faced with your first fight.&quot; Krowbarr, knowing there where Clerics on hand to heal<br>
                      those who mishandled the blade, wasn't too concerned about the youngsters health<br>
                      during this stage of training.<br>
<br>
                      After going through basic thrusting and slashing, Krowbarr was pleased with the<br>
                      ability of all present, but noted that Morls was ill at ease holding the sword. From<br>
                      observations earlier, this was to be expected. Now, the fun would begin, and the<br>
                      true Gemchoper trainee's would show themselves. It was time to kill a rat.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Line up single file, and follow me, we head for the druid ring.&quot; Krowbarr issued the<br>
                      command as if they were about to go fight a dragon. He could feel the air was<br>
                      charged with anticipation, and no little degree of fear. The creatures present out<br>
                      their where often killed by trained and accepted Guildmembers, not younglings<br>
                      without any training at all.<br>
<br>
                      Once the march was complete, Krowbarr ordered the youngsters to face the valley.<br>
                      &quot;What do you see down there youngsters?&quot;<br>
                      Morls: &quot;Vile Skeletons, and rats sir.&quot;<br>
                      Dryl: &quot;Things to practice on. Sir&quot;<br>
                      Korl: &quot;I see things I've only read about. Sir.&quot;<br>
                      Glasdorm: &quot;I see death.&quot;<br>
                      &quot;Death did you say? Good, you have assessed the situation correctly. Down there<br>
                      lies death for each of you as an individual. No matter how strong you think you are<br>
                      right now, no matter how well you handle your weapon, individually each of you<br>
                      would die in an encounter with any of the creatures you see below. Each of you,<br>
                      from first in line to last will meet one of the creatures below. Step forward according<br>
                      to your order in the line. Watch what I do, this is part of what will be expected of<br>
                      you later in life.&quot; Krowbarr said just before dropping into the valley. He quickly found a<br>
                      rat, kicked it so that it would chase him back to the youngsters. Heavily injured he<br>
                      had no doubt that any of them could kill it. When he topped the ridge, Dryl had<br>
                      somehow made it up front.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;This one is yours Dryl, remember slash, then thrust.&quot; Krowbarr said, before the last<br>
                      word was out, Dryl was slashing and thrusting, calling the rat names to pull it off of<br>
                      Krowbarr's leg. In a matter of seconds, the rat was dead. Dryl had a long gash from<br>
                      the rats biting on his leg. And to no surprise, Morls was administering a bandage.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Next&quot; Krowbarr yelled to the youngsters as he dropped down the hill to fetch<br>
                      another rat. As he got closer he yelled the customary &quot;Incoming Rat!&quot; The recruit<br>
                      looked brave for all of a second until his first slash missed the creature, and slashed<br>
                      his leg. At that point he began to run. Moving with out a thought, Dryl was on the<br>
                      rat oblivious to any danger present. When all was done, Morls was once again<br>
                      bandaging Dryl. Krowbarr looked at the group now one fewer.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Next&quot; He yelled. Over the course of the day the scenes went from tragedy to<br>
                      triumph until the group was down to only five. Morls, the last in line had not yet had<br>
                      his turn, and Krowbarr had a slight smile on his face when he guessed the outcome.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Your last Morls!&quot; Krowbarr once again dipped off the ledge and hollered &quot;Incoming&quot;<br>
                      Morls stood frightened, but ready. He slashed as trained, and thrusted, but nothing<br>
                      touched the rat. Morls had fought and fought but was now bleeding from several<br>
                      places. Looking weak he never took his eyes off of the prey. Once it was clear he<br>
                      couldn't kill the beast he yelled &quot;Assist me!&quot; and Dryl killed it quickly, now more<br>
                      proficient in the use of his sword. Clumsily Dryl applied his bandages to Morls right<br>
                      side and Morls did the same to his left. Krowbarr Told the group to say there, that<br>
                      he would return in a second.<br>
<br>
                      When he returned, a powerful gold clad cleric returned with him. All of the remaining<br>
                      5 would be completely healed. Krowbarr whispered into the Clerics ear and the Cleric<br>
                      handed him a mace. &quot;Now, Morls, Warriors must be proficient with a variety of<br>
                      weapons. Take this mace, the next thing pulled is all yours. You will not be assisted<br>
                      by anyone. If you fail, you die.&quot; The fear in Morls eyes was mixed with obvious<br>
                      respect for the Cleric in attendance, and comfort when he looked at the mace in his<br>
                      hand. <br>
<br>
                      Krowbarr grabbed Dryl by his shirt and brought him off to the side. &quot;Since you<br>
                      cannot just sit back and watch, you now have a new task before you. You will go<br>
                      down there. Be mindful of the creatures below, they can kill you. I want you to run<br>
                      down there, Hit a skeleton and run like your pants are on fire. Bring the Skeleton<br>
                      back to Morls. This is your last test for the day.&quot;<br>
<br>
                      Nodding in agreement Dryl quickly dropped out of sight. No sound was heard for<br>
                      several minutes and Krowbarr began to get worried. If the young recruit died he<br>
                      would be resurrected, but would likely prove of little use there after as a Gemchoper.<br>
                      The trauma produced by such an early death would likely scar him for life.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Incoming!!&quot; Screamed Dryl. The sound both frightened and excited. &quot;I have more<br>
                      than one on me!&quot; Krowbarr hurriedly instructed the group what to do. They must fight<br>
                      as a unit if they wish to survive this. As he crested the rise It was easily seen that<br>
                      he had one skeleton, one rat, and a kobold runt. Looking at his now very small<br>
                      group, he noticed it become two people smaller. Down to just 3 people Krowbarr new<br>
                      He would have to intervene.<br>
<br>
                      Before he could say a word, Morls was on the skeleton crushing it with his new mace<br>
                      As if he was born to the tool. Dryl had turned and attacked the Kobold runt, showing<br>
                      Signs of prowess with a blade that would one day make him a Gemchoper.<br>
<br>
                      Korl was set to destroy the rat. Above them on the hill, the Cleric looked to<br>
                      Krowbarr, Krowbarr nodded. If his trainees were close to death, the cleric would heal<br>
                      them. But not until they fell to the ground.<br>
<br>
                      For over a minute the battle raged. First the skeleton dropped into a pile on the<br>
                      ground. Morls looked up and saw that Korl was nearly dead from his injuries. He<br>
                      rushed over and instead of trying to kill the creature, he instead bandaged the more<br>
                      severe wounds on Korl. During a fight that is tricky at best, but Morls did it in a<br>
                      manner that never seamed to hinder Korl's fighting ability. Once done Morls looked at<br>
                      Dryl and back at Korl. It was clear Korl would need the assistance more. Moving<br>
                      closer to the rat, Morls began to work his mace. He and Korl working together to see<br>
                      the thing dead. And die it did. The two now turned to find Dryl. Dryl was standing,<br>
                      barely, with one foot on top of a now dead Kobold runt. Tears of happiness mixing in<br>
                      with blood from the battle streaked down his face.<br>
<br>
                      Krowbarr motioned for the three recruits to sit down in a circle near him and the<br>
                      Cleric. Once seated. Krowbarr took a long drink from his Jug of Gnomish spirits and<br>
                      passed it to the Cleric. After blessing the jug by drinking deeply from it, the Cleric of<br>
                      Brell Serillis passed the jug on to Morls who was seated next to him. When the jug<br>
                      made its way back to Krowbarr he smiled.<br>
<br>
                      Standing up Krowbarr began to speak. &quot;Dryl, you are first in this class, leave now<br>
                      and visit with Manik once again. You will receive your tunic and a newer sword. I am<br>
                      proud to count you amongst the Gemchopers!&quot; Looking to Korl Krowbarr spoke again.<br>
                      &quot;Korl, even when it was easy to see that the rat was besting you, you never gave<br>
                      up. Why is that?&quot; Korl responded &quot;Had I given up I would surely die, and the rat<br>
                      would go after Morls or Dryl. I did what I must to save them. I wish to thank Morls<br>
                      for his effort in keeping me alive sir, and aiding me in killing that rat.&quot; A smile broad<br>
                      and full of happiness now rested easily on Crowbar's face. &quot;You Korls are second in<br>
                      this class. You are brave and fierce in battle. I am proud to count you amongst the<br>
                      Gemchopers! Go now and receive your tunic. Wear it with pride.&quot;<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Morls, It has been apparent from the first that you are not a Gemchoper. You are<br>
                      brave and strong, fierce in battle and seem born to the skill of a mace.&quot; Krowbarr<br>
                      paused, the look of dismay on Morls face obvious and sadness pressed small tears<br>
                      from the young gnomes eyes. &quot;Was I not good enough in battle?&quot; Morls said pride<br>
                      forcing him to push out the question rather than sob.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;Indeed you where. You were as handy with the bandages as the Mace. Not a one<br>
                      amongst you noticed when others wounds needed taking care of.<br>
                      Not a one of them. Only you. Your spirit does not lie with the Gemchopers, neither<br>
                      does your career. Tell me, what God do you follow?&quot; Krowbarr asked, already<br>
                      knowing the answer.<br>
<br>
                      &quot;I Follow Brell sir.&quot; Answered Morls meekly. &quot;Then by all means boy follow him! You've<br>
                      the touch of a cleric no doubt!.&quot; Krowbarr looked over at the Gold clad cleric. &quot;What<br>
                      say you Fyxer?&quot; Fyxer replied &quot;Aye this one definitely belongs with us.&quot;<br>
<br>
                      &quot;So I am to be a Cleric?&quot; Relief showing deeply on his eyes. &quot;Oh Aye.&quot; Said Fyxer<br>
                      and Krowbarr. &quot;You will leave now, and follow Fyxer. You have done well this day,<br>
                      and the Gemchopers will all know you as a friend. Fyxer here was a part of my<br>
                      recruiting class. His use of the sword was worse than yours though.&quot; Krowbarr<br>
                      chuckled at the memory. &quot;I seem to recall him dropping it and cutting off a toe.&quot;<br>
                      Fyxer bonked Krowbarr on the head in myrth. &quot;You aren't supposed to tell my<br>
                      trainee's such things Krow.&quot; The four of them stood up and walked back to Ak'anon.<br>
                      Laughter could be heard throughout the night as Krowbarr and Fyxer Drank to the<br>
                      success of finding not only two Gemchopers, but a cleric in the mix as well. This was<br>
                      a good class indeed!<br>
