Seen something about the incident that happened with ED, KT and Us, and I couldn't reply and was told to vent here.<br>
<br>
Anyways, what happened was we asked VoF not to kill him so we could try, could have easily killed him when he spawned, but we couldn't and asked them to give us a chance.  We arrive at Kael with noone in the zone, just a few of us, was very early for us on a Saturday.  We minding our own business killing the mobs on the way to Tormax, when ED jumps up into that little alcove up by Tormax, we were at the bank, since some of people don't know their way around Kael.  We run up to pull more mobs, and there is a bunch of ED standing in our way.  What can we do?  We pull past them, they whine train we get banned.  These rotations starting to piss me off, and the fact that the people that made these rules never have shit to say when something goes bad, says to me they just care about themselves, and can give a fuck about what's going on.<br>
<br>
You wanna make rules, you need to inforce them and deal with the problems not just tell people to go away, you made these fucking rules not us.  Rules cause problems.  When your parents tell you the rules, do they never ground you if you break them?  Closing a thread about this where the guild representatives section is, is you being lazy as shit about dealing with problems cause by your fucked up rules.<br>
<br>
So ED get's to the Alcove, so we were in the zone first, we train them by pulling past them, we get banned, we go kill Sev right now out of rotation, nothing will happen people will just get pissed off, and say oh you can't get on any more rotations.  Good, I guess that means we can kill anything we want whenever we want.  Welcome to chaos, it's gonna happen soon if you don't look at the rules and redo them, or at least deal with the fucking bullshit that happens due to them.  I for one am not going to get banned on the server cause I am following rules made by some retards that can't deal with them.  And I was ready to just pull, since we were there first.  But then realized oh, I can't, cause GM's will actually ban me for following the server rules made by the high end guilds the reap the benefits from them all day long. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dytren>Dytren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/3/03 8:31:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ED and KT</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But then realized oh, I can't, cause GM's will actually ban me for following the server rules made by the high end guilds the reap the benefits from them all day long.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Actually so long as you are not breaking SOE Policies .. GM's can do exactly squat if you decide to go against the RTA ... **Big News Flash** You can do a ton of stuff against the RTA , without breaking SOE Policies. <br>
<br>
If they do ... Well then it, they aren't following their own policies , and can get themselves in trouble or fired. <br>

Anyways im sure it pissed you off but its easy all you have to do is ask VoF again if you guys can have a shot at it next week, its not like anyone was trained or died.

So what because the rules worked against you this time do you get mad, the rules say that A) you needed to be ingaged to KS B) that you race to the mob because just because you get permission doesnt mean its yours by the powers that be.<br>
<br>
On rot mobs there is one guild who can kill him that is on the rot list, now there is a trillion other guilds who arent on the rot that all have an equal shot at him and just getting permission doesnt mean crap because if im not mistaken if you guys fail then the guild who said go ahead still has to pass or kill in 24 hours.<br>

If you are in an area of a rot mob, and you are on that rot AND if you are not up for it; you should be mindfull of others around you. They might have permission to try the mob. You should get out of the way.<br>

<br>
Ok if you got banned, then you would not be on line to do anything else.<br>
So I am guessing what you mean was you were petitioned and the GM told you to behave, that is not banning.<br>
<br>
This also kinda sounds familiar, was this the day M&amp;M and COV joined ED midway through the afternoon for a possible Vindi ..which we then conceded to Yama?<br>
<br>
If this is the same day I am thinking, you pulled the mob from teh icehouse to the bank through a COV group who had a couple of ED with us. And I told you to control your pulls or we would kill them for you. If that was the initial situation..we were by the fisherman and boy were you lost...may I suggest a map.<br>

Shadyn, to help clear that up... ED was not on the King Tormax rotation at the time. We killed Tormax that day to get on the rotation.<br>
<br>
Seer, I'm sorry to say but unless I misunderstood, you are very off-base of what went on that day.<br>

<br>
Well, I was at the raid and I personally didn't see it like that. We came into Kael in full force very quickly and started moving to the Tormax area. Most of the AD people were still at the zone and there were a few standing around the bank area. I hardly see that as blocking. Tormax was dead within the hour, we were ready for him.<br>
<br>
I don't officially represent my guild. Hopefully one of our officers can respond soon, but I wanted to try to clear some confusion about this up before people went off flaming blindly. Anyhow, I think thats it.<br>

I got there and saw some AD at WL and some at the bank. When i got a tell from an AD rep they said they were clearing tormax's area. So in turn i went up to Tormax's area past those 2 troopers, saw my guild there, and everything was up from those two guards to everything inside KT's room. So i assumed they were &quot;planning&quot; to pull the Tormax area but did not start yet. We were in our spot, pulled stuff, killed KT.<br>
<br>
Not much else i can think of that was already stated. Just because a guild offers a chance at their due mob does not mean that no guild period can try also. It was FFA for both of us.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadynstormsurge>shadynstormsurge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/3/03 4:28:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: in response...</span><hr size=1> Thank you for clearing my comments up.

AD had 30 people in Kael and had already started pulling KT mobs, ED was at WL zone when we started pulling ( Glamaz and company as well as the first 4 Sentinels had already been pulled by AD )...  Our monk and MT go back up to Tormax area to pull another mob and ED is in our pull path....  We were forced to stop pulling so that we WOULDN'T get banned for training them (i.e. pulling THROUGH them) so they were able to get the kill and we have to wait...  <br>
Nevermind that if WE hadn't gotten VoF to back off, ED would NEVER have been able to get in our way that day because VoF would've already nailed his ass to the wall... The point is, AD HAD already started pulling KT area and when ED did a camp check, AD CALLED KT....  When we found ED in our pull path, our GL sent a tell to the ED GL and was told that he had just logged on and had no clue so our GL then contacted the ED raid leader and was basically told to piss off... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jathan1>Jathan1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/4/03 1:40:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re</span><hr size=1> I really don't want to get into this again.

If you still feel that we slighted you, ED will give AD a chance to kill KT on our next rot turn. <br>

If VoF hasent killed it any guild can go for it. It would probably be the same if it wasent our guild that went in and Dropped KT before you, you would just blame another guild and try to make them look bad. <br>

We were trying to figure out if we should or not.<br>
<br>
ED is Ally to Kael or was at the time, we had to actually clear mobs to get up to the area, they just ran by us while we were clearing, as I said in the first post the reason for people standing at WL is they simple are not familiar with the zone.  They don't go there everyday.<br>
<br>
Not pissed off because we were given permission for the mob, was pissed off because we were there first, we had to actually kill mobs and they block our pulls by sitting in the way cause they can just walk past everything.  Is this jealousy?  No.  Ask VoF for another shot?  ED gives us a shot?  Point is, my guild is very very very small, and often times we can't field enough people to raid anything, when we do get enough people we have taken out mobs with very little people such as Statue and our first Vindi Zlandicar etc.  List can go on, and it's not like we have 50 lvl 65's in my guild, we have 7 or 8 lvl 65's the rest are lower level, we have the skills we lack the people.<br>
<br>
If you have seen me post before, you know I ramble a lot, and the main thing for me was, I wanted to have a civil conversation about this not in the Flame section, and the people that make the rules on our server tell us to take it to the flame board, more than anything I am flaming them for ignoring the situation and asking us to take it to flames.  I would have much rather talked about this in the boards with guild leaders and the people that make the rules on the server, rather than having everyone that plays the game give their own little opinion of what happened that day.<br>
<br>
Honestly I can give a fuck, I just thought it was quite rude, and even more rude for the people that run these boards to force us to take this to flame boards to discuss it.  This is just a game afterall, even though real people get offended and hurt.<br>
<br>
Anyways, just have some fun people, quit being dicks to the smaller guilds, who did nothing to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=extrafth>Extrafth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Altus Domini</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/5/03 7:51:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> Also, whoever said it was 2 weeks ago and we obviously didn't wanna fight about it then.<br>
<br>
Most of us don't read these boards.  When we do, it's usually once - twice a month or so.  We aren't sitting on these boards all day.  And most of my guild lives in the same area, so we have get togethers, and do things other than play EQ all day and sit on these boards all day.  At the time I told everyone to just STFU and we'll get our chance someday.  They listened, they came to boards and just blew it off.  I came here to have a conversation with the leaders and the people that make the rules, and am told to make this a public discussion.  I don't feel that is right, but I wanted to say something, if you noticed my first post, I hardly spoke of the situation with ED and KT, and more so on the fact that the people making the rules, don't gives a shit about anything.  If it is not directly making them better, fuck you.<br>
<br>
Since I am sure they will come here eventually and ask how this betters them, here is just one example.<br>
<br>
When VoF LoM FK LoL was all trying AoW, the &quot;rulemakers&quot; were saying they can only try AoW on their Statue turn, cause that is the way it's always been.  The problem with this was, back when they were all trying AoW, there was 4 guilds on statue rotation, now there is 20.  With VoF LoM FK LoL and whoever else was trying AoW at the time not on the AoW rotation, I guess the guilds that been farming him for a year, just get to keep killing him more often.  Who does this better?  The guilds on AoW rotation?  or the guilds trying to get on rotation?  Nuff said. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1133.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1133.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=1133.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=1133.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=1133.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=1133.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1133.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1133.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm68">Current World Events<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm69">Elemental Planes</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15>Flame Central</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.238<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
