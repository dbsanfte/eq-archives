I would hate to think what position we would be in if she did not run this list. Even if Verant did allow GM's to run it I hardly see how they could do any better.<br>
<br>
That being said is there any validity in saying that those without a pearl make the list seem suspect? I think there is to a small extent. I also understand how it happened and would hate to see anyone punished for a rule change. So maybe some discussion to see if we as clerics think it should be altered at all would be good. I am not advocating any of these but merely posting ideas that may allow this list to continue to be a success.<br>
<br>
The main injustice with the list would seem to be that those with pearls are so far behind those without them. How would you feel in their place? Yes they have plenty of time to finish before their turns come up but still I think you can see what I am talking about. So what should/could be done to remedy this?<br>
<br>
One suggestion would be to move all with pearls up in line while keeping those on the list without the pearl. Then set a deadline for the pearless to get the pearl. You could do it one of two ways.<br>
 a) As they get the pearl they are moved up on this list. This would place alot of initiative on getting it done because it would allow some of those with no pearl to pass up some of the others with no pearl.<br>
 b) Or they keep their positions but the ones that do not get the pearls are removed at the deadline. With this option NO ONE would fall very many places unless they just did not get the pearl at all.<br>
<br>
Does that make sense? It would place initiative on getting the Pearl and make the list look better in the process. <br>
<br>
Another option would be just to place a deadline for those on the list to get their pearl or be removed. Say one month or something. Again this would create initiative to get the pearl. After one month all those left on the list would have a P after their name.<br>
<br>
Last option. Leave it how it is, shut up, and dont worry about it.<br>
<br>
The ONLY reason I bring this up is because it has to hurt those that are finished with pearl in hand to see so many infront of them that concievably may have not even started the quest. If we start getting a bunch of disgruntled clerics then the list has a higher probability of failing and that is the last thing I would ever want to see.<br>
<br>
I also think that swapping places should only be done between the cleric up and the cleric behind them. I can really see no good reason for people to be able to move around in the list if everyone has there pearl unless they cannot do Rage when there time comes up. For instance if someone will be out of town when their turn at Rage is up then they could post to skip them until they return. Also with no swapping if someone leaves the game it will just be a bonus that everyone gets to move up a slot.<br>
<br>
I hope no one takes this the wrong way. The last thing I would want to see is cleric removed from the list, well almost the last thing. The last thing I want to see is the list ever fail.<br>
<br>
I apologize if this was in poor taste for me to bring up when the list is going so well, I just want to head off trouble before it starts if at all possible.<br>

I did not have my pearl before I added myself to the list.  I had assumed that I was not allowed to add myself unless I had the pearl.  I learned otherwise and added myself.  Mainly becuase I felt that I could get the pearl before my time on the list and I did not want to wait 6 months as I plodded from the back of the line.  Sure that may be selfish, but I was only working within the rules.  The plain fact is, to move the people without pearls now, would defy the trust they put into this system as they asked to be added.  I don't mind waiting.  Then again, I dont know how many in front of me do not have their pearls.  Thanks for listening..<br>

<br>
The list will remain as is.  I have suggested those without a pearl volunteer to move themselves, but in no way will i move anyone for getting on the list under the loophole at the time.<br>
<br>
Just a side note.  I get about 4 - 5 emails a week from folks who want to get on the list.  None of them have thier pearls and I have added none of those people.  Since the pearl rule has been enforced hard I have added 1 person in 5 weeks to the list, and 4 people have gotten thier epics and moved off the list.  So any more great fear of a huge list swelling is curbed for the time being.<br>
<br>
I have found that a few folks get angry at first when I tell them I won't add them without a pearl.  After I explain it to them most seem to calm down and Understand.  I get the reply that they know of a few on the list who have not even started the quest, and while that may be true they got in before the enforcement.<br>
<br>
It is true, I do have my epic and have had it since February.  I keep up this list due to popular demand and support.  I even saw somewhere in this thread or an email I got that I maintain this list so my friends and guildies can get special treatment.  This boggles my mind.  I have 2 guildies on this list and they were added to the last open slot at the time.  I like to consider all the clerics on this list my friends, so that arguement does not hold water.  I get no compensation at all for this job.  I get no PP under the table to move stuff around.  I do this simply to help out.  I know how much my epic meant to me, and I think everyone should get a fair shot at it without having to worry much about KSing and all the nasties I read about on other servers.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for your support and kind words.<br>

As I said in my earlier post, in no way was I questioning Fayenae's ability or integrity.  I know that no GM would ever give us real customer support; my previous comments were more rhetoric than anything.  However, I would like it if they did.<br>
<br>
I do have a few more comments that I would like to add to the fray of discussion.<br>
<br>
First, the lack of communication to clerics beginning the quest.  How are they supposed to know about the list?  How are they supposed to know that they are supposed to get on this list before they start camping Ragefire?  Is there a way to communicate the need to be on the list other than putting up with the dunder heads at the spawn that won't show any consideration for lack of knowledge on this spawn's protocol?<br>
<br>
Second, I agree with Troy that the clerics on the list without pearls should be given a time frame to work within.  One month should be a sufficient amount of time for those on the list without pearls to get them (the fact that I go that far even surprises me), however, there are some that do not have that long because they should get to the top of the list before then, Bijinko being the first of that category.  For those that reach the top without a pearl, I suggest removing them until they do get their pearl.  When they do, they should be put at the back of the list.  Some of you may wonder why I seem to be so harsh.  I would compare having the pearl to going to the store to buy something.  Imagine, you get in line to buy your items only to discover that you don't have any money on you.  What are your options?  1) Get out of line, go home, get your money, then get at the back of the line or 2) borrow the necessary materials from someone else so that you don't have to resort to option number one.  Unfortunately in our case, the second option does not exist.  If the second option did exist, then there would be a plethora of people capitalizing on it.<br>
<br>
Third, I have a problem with people that respond irrationally when someone questions why and what other people are doing.  I will leave that up to the rest of you to determine who responded that way to my earlier post.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, and this is intended more as a response to Mystala than anything, anonymity is a wonderful thing.  I knew there was going to be some person or people that would respond irrationally to my questioning.  Knowing that, I intentionally created an account to preserve that anonymity and to save myself the effort of putting anyone on my ignore list.  However, you must remember that not everybody participates in the message boards nor does everyone know that this particular thread exists.  In fact, my earlier post was my first.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueayenaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eayenaf</A> at: 5/11/01 7:52:05 am</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#F5F5DC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufayenae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fayenae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>302</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>5/11/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>7:22:48 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Community Supporter</FONT><BR></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re:  Ragefire spawns:  reservation/rotation list</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Oh, and to address one more concern. No one has made it to the Rage part and not had the pearl, so far.  If someone does do that there will be NO waiting on them. They penalty is harsh, to the bottom they go.  Why?  Because they wasted our time and a spot on the list for a quest they were either A) not really into doing, or B)not capable of doing.<br>
<br>
So I make this warning to the people on the list without a pearl, get to it. Don't let your time sneak up on you and you not be ready, the penalty is not good.<br>
<br>
Hope this answers your question.  We will accept NO excuse from anyone who gets to Rage and has no pearl.<br>

<br>
Let me re-iterate my concerns here.  What Fayenae has just suggested is not a harsh penalty; they are still on the list.  The only penalty you are suggesting is to move them to the bottom.  With your suggested punishment the problem still exists -- people without pearls are still on the list.  With the mentality of what you have suggested, a case could be made to keep people on the list that fail at the attempt to kill Ragefire, which is wrong.  My solution is as it was in my post above -- remove them completely from the list if they reach the top of the list without a pearl.  The second stipulation I suggested is to give those people on the list without a pearl a time frame to get the necessary quest materials; this is to prevent people without pearls from exchanging places with others on the list that do have pearls indefinitely, perpetuating the problem of having people on the list without pearls.<br>
<br>
Now for my other concern which was not addressed, I will re-post it here.<br>
<br>
BEGIN REPOST:<br>
First, the lack of communication to clerics beginning the quest. How are they supposed to know about the list? How are they supposed to know that they are supposed to get on this list before they start camping Ragefire? Is there a way to communicate the need to be on the list other than putting up with the dunder heads at the spawn that won't show any consideration for lack of knowledge on this spawn's protocol?<br>

<br>
Ok, here we go again.  If you were to get to the top of the list and not have a pearl you would fall to the back, BUT would it not make sense that that could not happen since no one is being added to the list with no pearl?  So more or less it would be a &quot;bye, come see us when you do the quest&quot;.<br>
 Again, my concern over what you think is diminishing with each anon post you make. Sorry.<br>
<br>
Now, as a matter of communication, this works the same as the caleneder.  Sure some may not know about it, but most do.  This list is pretty famous, and I stay on top of each and every person that is on it.  They all tell me when they have killed Ragfire and most of the time the tell the next cleric in line.  I get emails and tells from folks who I have never heard of or seen, but they all know me and they know of this list.<br>
<br>
I am glad to answer any questions that anyone has, but there are 14 pages to this thread that contain just about any answer you need.  I also am going to stop debating with an anon poster.  You do not have to change your account name, just add your sig to your post.  Make you a more respectable debater if you have the balls to reap the hell or praise from your posts.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

I dont expect any of the few pearless in front of me to not get their pearl. My thought are more directed at the large group of pearless between the three pearl holders at the back of the line.<br>
<br>
Anon poster - I promise you that no Cleric that has their pearl is unfamiliar with this list. There are some things you just learn in EQ. If it was just a list that every cleric needed to get on to reserve a place I would agree that it would not be fair to all. <br>
<br>
My thoughts on a Deadline - I do not think it would be unreasonable to set a deadline for the Pearl, as long as it was at least a month. You could do start to pearl in that amount of time fairly easy. The idea would just be that it would seperate those that are truely moving forward with the quest from those that are not, I would not expect anyone to not get this done if they asked to do so. After all they have all been on this list a while and I would hope they would at least started. If the clerics without a pearl work together they could all get their staffs one day and get their notes in a couple of day long trips to Chardok.<br>
<br>
I want to see this list to be a success for a long long time. I dont like feeling like I am pushing this so hard. That is truely not my intention. I just feel like we can get it done and not only the people on the list but the people signing up will all be better off. I mean we are talking about clerics here. I know we can help each other make a push on this and in a months time there would be a lot less tension when someone comes to sign up. The only gripe they would have at that point would be that they did not get their Pearl sooner.<br>
<br>
One last thing. Fay could you post you thoughts on swapping places? If someone leaves do you think it is ok for them to give their spot away? Or what if nothing changes and they are getting close to Rage and they swap places with someone behind them? I know this has been brought up several times and I dont recall ever seeing a good reason for allowing swaps. I also know this has not been a big problem but it would be nice if it was spelled out in the rules that if you quit EQ you lose your spot.<br>
<br>
Man I feel like such a trouble maker. I will make this my last post on it. If no one can see any logic in what I am saying then I am obviously alone in my thoughts.

Just disrequard my post as it is obviously not what anyone thinks would be in the best interest of a successful list. Heck the list is already a success. <br>
<br>
Also Lerwin I know you swapped places and that is fine. However I also know that it would make everyone feel better if they all got a free move up in line rather than one person getting the move up. Does that make sense? There is no way in the world we will let Bjinko get to the top with no note. She has a thousand friends and though she does not know me well I am one of them.<br>

It is often in the light of rational thinking that irrational and derogatory remarks are made, even by Fayenae.  As I said in one of my previous posts &quot;...anonymity is a wonderful thing.

<br>
If it is a debate, then nobody has given any logical arguments as to why we should keep those people without pearls on the list.  However, I am not trying to debate, I am trying to institute a change where I see a flaw.  The flaw is in the thinking that putting someone without a pearl at the back of the list is a punishment -- they are still there.  In fact, they will still be in front of anybody else that comes along after them with a legitimate claim to Ragefire.  Why not remove them completely and only re-add them to the end of the list when they do get the pearl?  In the context of my shopping/check-out example, those people should not be there at all, but even I am willing to give them a time frame to get that done.  I don't think it should be an indefinite amount of time though.  That is why I have stated that there are two reasons why those people without pearls should be removed: 1) they reach the top of the list and still don't have a pearl or 2) they don't get the pearl within a specified amount of time.  Is that too much to ask or are you performing this role so that you can tell people what they can and cannot do?</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#CCCCCC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucayleustarshine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cayleu Starshine</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>104</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>5/11/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>10:36:03 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re:  Ragefire spawns:  reservation/rotation list</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">It doesn't matter if I agree or disagree, an anon poster is someone who did not have the courage to stand up for what they believe in.

Please do not post anon, a big reason you are being &quot;flamed&quot; as you see it, (its really not that bad of a flame) is your anon status.

<br>
I am going to type this out for you one more time.<br>
1. NO ONE will be removed from the list.<br>
<br>
2.  IF they get to Ragefire with no pearl they will be dropped and have to wait to get the pearl to get on the list.  That pretty much is understood.  I the beginning they would have fallen to the back of the list, but no one can be added to the back of the list without a pearl now, so they can't be added until they get a pearl.  Then they wil be at the end of the list.  Hence, they will fall to the back of the list.<br>
<br>
3.  This list is famous, well known, and works well.  Most on Luclin know about it, not saying all, but they will find out about it at some point.  <br>
<br>
Again, i listen to all suggestions, but please don't come here anon because you don't want to get ingame tells and start saying you have found problems you want fixed.  It don't fly.  Part of solving a problem is taking all the flak and praise that comes with it.  I have NO ONE on my ignore list and I head this thing up. (well no one that has to do with this list)  If anyone would get flamed in game it would be me.  I have had heated discussions, but part of working through a problem may be a heated discussion.  Facts of life.<br>
<br>
Oh, and don't start that &quot;ban Fayenea for flaming me&quot; crap.  Anyone reading this will see I flamed no one. I only stated the obvious.  Oh, and the last person inthis game who would flame and torture you in tells is me.  I am a cleric, i am too busy to argue in tells with someone for no reason.<br>

Troy,<br>
<br>
AsS far as switching places goes it is allowed as long as I do not see an abuse of it.  Yes, that is a good idea to not let non pearl holders do any switching (real real good idea in fact).  I use my judgement when it comes to switching names around, especially when it does not affect the people around the switchers.  If i ever hear of and selling spots both people will be booted from the spot.  People who leave the game are immediately removed.  Example is Jascenta; she made a huge post about her leaving so the day I read that i removed her.  If she returns to the game she can get her spot back, after she gets the pearl.  She made no note in her post to give he spot to anyone else. I have had some /tells asking for her spot, but she was removed so  in essence has not spot to give away.<br>
<br>
Trading is ok in the right circumstances, as I said.  Going out of town, sickness, emergency's, or anyhting along that line.  If you are leaving the game and are on the list you can give the spot to another ON THE LIST as in Lerwin's case.  He could not have given that spot to a person not on the list already.<br>

Raistlin coughed and shook his head sadly.<BR>
"Do you see hope?"<BR>
"Hope is the denial of reality.  It is the carrot dangled before the draft horse<BR> to keep him plodding along in a vain attempt to reach it."<BR>
"Are you saying we should just give up?" Tanis asked irritably.<BR>
"I'm saying we should remove the carrot and walk forward with our eyes<BR> open," Raistlin answered...<P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#CCCCCC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueayenaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eayenaf</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>5</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>5/11/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>1:05:41 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re:  Ragefire spawns:  reservation/rotation list</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Business is more than making financial decisions, it is also working with people -- often with people you don't know.  To run a business effectively and efficiently, you need training.  With that training, you would be able to determine whether the anonymous person was giving you sound advice or blowing smoke (although this would probably be the more likely case).  If you cannot trust yourself to listen to other people with good ideas, regardless of who they are, then you should not be the one leading these efforts -- you can't trust yourself to listen to others and still be able to make good decisions.  In the context of this discussion, this is not a business.  If it was a business, then can you honestly say that you have training for managing the people of this server?  Do you know what is best for everyone?<br>
<br>
If you would have said that you were going to remove people in the first place, then maybe we wouldn't be having this discussion at this point Fayenae.  A simple, &quot;I agree that they should be removed&quot; would have sufficed.  Why then did you drag this out?  Saying that people will be moved to the back of the list is one thing, removing them is another.  You had NOT previously said &quot;IF they get to Ragefire with no pearl they will be dropped and have to wait to get the pearl to get on the list.&quot;  What you did say was &quot;If you were to get to the top of the list and not have a pearl you would fall to the back&quot;.  If you want to convey a point, then be clear about it.  Falling to the back of the list is a completely different concept than removing people from the list.<br>
<br>
Lastly, what does &quot;NO ONE will be removed from the list&quot; mean?  Nobody will be removed from the list even if they still don't have a pearl in a month's time frame?  A month's time frame seems to be a poplular choice -- one that was suggested by someone else.  Is not a month's time frame enough for a player to fully demonstrate, using your words, &quot;A) really into doing [the quest], [and] B) capable of doing [the quest]&quot;?  Honesty and integrity may be virtues that you hold, but clear communication and logical thinking are not.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueayenaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eayenaf</A> at: 5/11/01 2:10:04 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=95%><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Page</FONT>&nbsp; <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>1</FONT>&nbsp; <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=587.topic&start=21&stop=24><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>2</FONT></a></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT> &nbsp;<A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=786.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Next Topic >></FONT></A> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR><TABLE WIDTH=95% BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=587.topic&index=279><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=587.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/images/email.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Email This To a Friend"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;Email This To a Friend</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.threadControl?topicID=587.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Topic Control Image"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic Commands (Moderator only)</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=587.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Subscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to receive email notification of replies</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=587.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Unsubscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</FONT><BR></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER><BR><FORM ACTION=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum METHOD=POST><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Jump to: </FONT><SELECT NAME=forumName><OPTION VALUE=luclin71335general>General<OPTION VALUE=luclin71335trading>Trading<OPTION VALUE=luclin71335frm7>Spell Trading<OPTION VALUE=luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes>Dragons and the Planes<OPTION VALUE=luclin71335frm8>Scars of Velious<OPTION VALUE=luclin71335roleplaying>Roleplaying<OPTION VALUE=luclin71335grouping>Grouping<OPTION VALUE=luclin71335guilds>Guilds<OPTION VALUE=luclin71335flamesandrants>Flames and Rants</SELECT><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=Go></FORM></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>- </FONT><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Luclin</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000> - </FONT><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Dragons and the Planes</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000> - </FONT></B></CENTER><center><a href="http://www.luclin.com">Luclin.com</a></center><P><BR><CENTER><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.free-irewards.com/cgi-bin/ezboard/games.html?id=ouuIcESe" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/banners/iRewards120x30-08.gif"></a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=7279965&siteid=33932331&bfpage=roleplaygames" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
