<br>
I noticed that if from the mission booth near West Athens if you select as hard as it gets, and select Newland.  You can take the whompa there and probably do all 3 missions in an hour or so and walk away with 15-20k credits.<br>
<br>
Thats what I figure they are doing.<br>

They panic when they start to lose money and are forced to find some means of making a profit, well EQ did the same thing, though most the bugs in EQ are fixed, it is just fundamentally broken now.  <br>
<br>
Aside from the massive amount of bugs, (ESPECIALLY the memory leak which forces me to reboot every 30 mins) the gameplay concept in general is ingenious compared to EQ.  In comparison, everyone being able to walk into karnors with your group and have the zone to yourself and being able to actually dungeon crawl and hunt through the zone from room to room to the end boss is nice, even determining the level of the zone perportionally to your group size (easy to hard).  The same fun with fewer people works for me.  This game caters to the casual player enabling me to not spend 30 hrs organizing a raid that goes disasterously wrong because too many people that can't listen.  It rids the boredom of pulling mob spawns to a &quot;camp&quot; over and over.  It gets rid of the hours of corpse retrieval and waiting on GM support for corpse bugs.  All of that to me adds realism and fun rather than stress and boredom.  I know some people like to hunt the outdoor zones and I like that the option for that is there as well rather than doing missions.  I love doing missions with my RL friend, she and I can do it just us two with it set on 80% difficulty.   I'm just bored at work and blabbering though. Sorry to get on a tangent.  My point being regardless of the bugs and lack of support and security, just trying point out all the good concepts.  I see people bitching so much but if AO has managed to pull me from EQ as much as I'm not into the sci fi game thing, then there is definately something about it that is good.  Although the only time I play is when my friend is playing. <p><center><a href="http://www.silentsentinels.com"><img src="http://www.vanitey.com/signature.jpg" border=0 align=bottom></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udreadstar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dreadstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dervish Cutthroat</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/23/01 6:50:09 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AO hacked(???)</span><hr size=1> Lieah, I agree with you.  It's one reason I stay away from aoforums, even though it has a lot of information that you have to weed through all the crap.<br>
<br>
People complain about the economy, the community, bugs, exploits, lack of support and the list goes on.  But like you said when you rush a product out, you'll have these problems.  I also think to an extent they *had* to release the game to the public eventually to find these problems.  In a small controlled environment, some problems won't show themselves..<br>
<br>
I have to admit, lately I've been really angry with the game only because of the memory issue.  I too need to reboot every 30 minutes or so.  Or several times just to get through a city.  That gets really old.  Last night while taking the whompa from Athens to Newland, I made a left hand turn to bolt to the exit.  I went ld due to the memory problem.  When I tried to get connected again I couldn't for over an hour.  I would log in.  Start seeing the graphics load and then it would pop me out to the desktop. I called it a night since I couldn't get in. This morning figuring that if it was due to the load and a lot of people being in there, that it would maybe work.  Needless to say I was able to move my char out of the zone.<br>
<br>
But all in all.  This game suits me a lot better then EQ.  Even though I spent a long time playing EQ...<br>
<br>
I thought you weren't too pleased with AO, from the few posts I remember reading of yours.  Sounds like your more-so enjoying it now...<br>

Great post Lieah I agree whole heartedly, although now I have been doing so many missions that I am way ahead of all my rl friends, I may have to make an alt to just play with them since I get so much of a rush out of soloing a mission that I can't help myself and am now 8-10 lvls above all my friends.  I just hope that at high lvls I became an EQ warrior, where I am entirely group depenedent and can't do crap other than sitting around taking hits.<br>

Shitloads of people quit UO and EQ when they began for similar reasons, no game is ever perfect, and with the hype AO had its no wonder people were dissapointed, I feel bad for the people working on Horizons, the hype for that game is absurd and you know what, at least half the people posting on those boards are going to hate the game at first and most likely quit before the game even gets a chance.<br>
Right now I am loving AO, finally a game for the casual player.<br>

I'm not sure yet if there are raids in AO or not, if there are I expect them to run alot smoother and faster.   I'm hoping DAoC will be the same, they say it is. <p><center><a href="http://www.silentsentinels.com"><img src="http://www.vanitey.com/signature.jpg" border=0 align=bottom></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhuffwinwindbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Huffwin Windbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Legionairre</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/24/01 10:57:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AO hacked(???)</span><hr size=1> I think that large scale raids in this game will be more impromptu and will involve attacking other factions, so its not likely uber guilds will fight over who gets to camp Omni-1 or anything of that nature. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.showMessage?topicID=122.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.showMessage?topicID=120.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.emailToFriend?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.threadControl?topicID=119.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=119.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=119.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9>Other games (super condensed)</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
