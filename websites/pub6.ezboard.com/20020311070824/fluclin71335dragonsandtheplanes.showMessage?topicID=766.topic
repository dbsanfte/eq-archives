He only pops once a week, yet there are reservations on the 23rd, 24th, 25th, and 26th for him.<br>
<br>
Um. Excuse me?<br>
<br>
So what are we doing with him now? Just pick a day and if you are lucky enough to be the one who reserved the day he respawns, you get to kill him.<br>
<br>
If we are going FFA with Naggy, then fine. Whatever. I know he has to die ASAP to get the Ragefire spawn up, but this &quot;reserve it maybe&quot; system is not working for me.<br>
<br>
Naggy died last night under Sharia's raid, so he is next in line to be killed this Thursday. Elendil and I were going to try and take him down tomorrow but since there was a patch last week, it threw the spawn off and since I was otherwise committed to a Hate raid last night, she took Naggy down as soon as he popped. I have no beefs with that at all. However, does this mean I can try for next Thursday for him? Not likely as there are those 4 reservations for him next week.<br>
<br>
My suggestion? One of two things. Either ONE Naggy reservation allowed per week should be honored with a couple alternates in line. If the spawn day is altered, that person must be Johnny on the spot to take him down or else surrender the reservation to the next person on the list.<br>
<br>
If that doesn't work for you, we go FFA. If he is up and you can get a group together to take him down, do it.<br>
<br>
What say you all? <p><p align="center">

So if he pops on Tuesday he should be dead no later than Wednesday night.  If you had a raid planned sounds like you should get next crack at him.  I would post your intentions on the boards and then post a time you will kill him when you have an idea of when he will spawn.<br>

He was taken down way to late for him to spawn on Wednesday. I posted to make sure he is taken down for all clerics to get maximum time on Ragefire. He popped Tuesday afternoon but Sharia had him reserved for Wed. so I let him alone and had some ppl complaining he was up too long. I also decided to host this raid based on what happened at Sharia's raid. I felt things were done inefficently and she claimed a red dragon scale was reserved on message board when it was not and looted to help someone that wasnt even on raid nor helped with raid. The previous raid she led (against Vox) she claimed since noone got a major upgrade on the spear Vox dropped she was keeping. <br>
In my opinion this is wrong. If it is a raid where a guild or person has a definate need for an item (like pally book) then it shouldnt be reserved and if noone can upgrade an item then it is randomed to all persons not given to someone because who they are. I asked Torlan to help with buffs if he can and he said he would be happy to. For those who have done Naggy in the last 2 months you will probably know that I have been helping persons make groups and Torlan has been helping with buffs and we have led a couple of raids on naggy when the server was coming down daily. Im not saying we are perfect in raiding Naggy but let our record speak for iteself. It is effecient and usually done start to finish in less than 2 hours with FGs up and my raids average 2 deaths per fight with less than 40 ppl. Last night there were 25 deaths with 52 ppl and took 3 hours just to make groups and buff with no FGs up. <br>
I hope everyone understands why I am doing this I have had at least 50 ppl in the last week ask me why im not leading or helping lead Naggy everyweek. Im not sure thats a good idea since it doesnt let others have a chance at learning how to organize raid. I am always willing to give advice and help when i can. I will continue to try and lead em when Naggy is up if noone else has him reserved on the day he is scheduled to spawn. If you reserve him for a particular day then I think you should keep up with when he will pop and move your raid to that day. Spawns dont wait on persons to come kill em you need to take the initiative and at least talk to persons and ask when he dropped last and make a simple amends to the reservation. Oh well maybe we can get this thing done more effeciently so more clerics can get shot at ragefire. any suggestions I will listen to post or send me a tell in game im a good listener <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Let me just say that I was not digging on you at all. I have been on raids with you guys and you sure know what you are doing.<br>

It's the chaotic nature of how Naggy and Vox are &quot;reserved&quot; that bugs me.<br>

Sure we could have buffed, gone to chat and waited around to find clerics (in the beginning we had 3, only one of which was above 49), we had 2 druids I believe, and one shaman.  Do you seriously think that was enough people to take naggy? And at that point remember we had no high level cleric buffs either because Torlan came when half of the groups had already camped to chat.  I don't think we'd have succeeded with the forces we had when we first got to Sol B.<br>
<br>
I've tried organizing naggy raids myself and I have run into the same problem.  This problem arises from the last minute nature of these raids.  I'm sure if people had a week to plan, then things like this wouldn't be a problem, but with the attitude of having to take Naggy down on the day he pops, combined with the level cap on the people who can attempt to take him down, this DOES cause a problem.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you can organize a wonderful raid.  I am not criticizing your abilities in the least.  But you've gotta realize that some people are not super well connected and can't find people at the snap of their fingers.  I know just how difficult these things can be to run so maybe I'm a little more forgiving than most.<br>

I asked how many we had she said 3. I asked how many druids/shamans we had she said druids/shamans dont count on raids. In my opinion this is wrong. Most dragons can be taken down with only 3 clerics if you have sufficent druids and shamans. We had total of 6 druids when we took him down and 1 shaman. I know for a fact that 3 persons told her that 2 50+ druids &amp; shamans = cleric. She said she would not do it without 6 clerics. 3 of which were not even sent in on initial rush.<br>
Another fact is the group structuring was very poor. at 10:30 pm CST when everyone was seated in the throne room while she attempted groups she gave 6 groups out only 2 of which were full. that left roughly 20ppl without groups. After seeing groups she had put rogues and monks less than lvl 50 in the initial rush groups and left 50+ warriors and monks in the 2nd rush group. Now this may be some new tactic but most persons I spoke with there said this sounded like groups 1-3 were cannon fodder and groups 4-6 were the kill groups. My group of 51 war/52monk/52war/51rng/48shaman/50cleric got the xp and we were group 5 and we had 3 deaths! Total deaths were 27+. Im not saying that the FGs popping didnt contribute to this but with 50+ppl on a naggy raid flipping pure numbers alone should win this especially with the amount of 50+ warriors there. <br>
As for recruiting of persons it doesnt take being well connected it takes good orginization. I know of 6 clerics that could do dragons that will not do them if Sharia's is leading the raid. I used to think this silly but after this last naggy raid i can see the reason of this. I saw none of the same clerics as the previous 3 weeks worth of raids even though only 1 had advanced to lvl 53. Where the previous 3 weeks worth of raids the same clerics were attending regularly. When i tried to help get clerics for this one all i got as a response was... &quot;Sharia is leading? uhmmm im going to farm blackburrow&quot; or similar response. A 51 cleric actually told me he was farming blackburrow? WTF is that about. I have most doubtedly burt all bridges with Legacy of the Chosen so I in closing say that I will not be attending anymore raids done by Sharia if that offends persons I am sorry but its just a matter of every raid I have attended of hers (over 6)has taken at least 3 hours from start to finish with 3 taking over 5 hours to complete and I just dont have that much time to sit around. I know all help i tried to give was rebuffed and help from others was also rebuffed. As for Torlan not coming to help with buffing... that is something that im sure he can respond to but he may have not been willing to come help with her for his own reasons... after this raid I doubt I would come buff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uirtumble.showPublicProfile?language=EN>I R Tumble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/21/01 7:02:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=766.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Naggy thing is starting to get lame</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;So what are we doing with him now?

because some fags don't have the respect for other players in this game and need to bash their abilities<br>
even tho they don't know @#%$ from their ass<br>
it's one thing to trash your own raid<br>
&quot;ah man, i can't believe how bad i set this up&quot;<br>
but it's something entirely different to talk sh~t about someone else's raid when you weren't even leading<br>
if you tried to do something with half the players that it took to do normally<br>
and failed miserably<br>
would people talk @#%$ about you?<br>
hopefully<br>
because that's what you're doing here<br>
you know the facts you Want to know<br>
you don't know what was going on from anyone elses point of view<br>
you can't tell for sure how many people had other things to do<br>
sure, a few people aren't going to want to come because they know if sharia's leading a raid something will not be lottoed for<br>
there are reasons she puts countless hours into doing sh~t like this<br>
just like there are reasons people show up and wait hours to kill one stupid dragon<br>
she doesn't twist your arm to come and help<br>
hell, she didn't even Invite you Jugg<br>
you just showed up expecting to be part of it<br>
and now you come here and b~tch about sh~t?<br>
i could see if she begged you to come and help out, but truth is, nothing would have changed if you weren't there. no one could give a rat's ass if you came to help out. and i'm sure no one's losing sleep because *gasp* jugg won't come to anymore of sharia's raids<br>
the only thing that would have been different is whiney b~tches like you that complain when they don't know something is reserved because they just show-up expecting sh~t make people feel bad and look bad<br>
and the fact that you display half the facts in order to Make someone look bad is just f~cking low<br>
let me come on a raid and critisize you for every little thing _i_ would have done differently because _i_ am better than you because _i_ can do sh~t faster, and more efficient, OBVIOUSLY<br>
yes, and OBVIOUSLY you're a big headed @#%$ because you can't even appreciate the time and effort some people put into sh~t like this and just judge it from the side and say, yah.. i can do that so much better<br>
i know i'm not getting flooded with tells like she is<br>
i know i don't have people bailing every 5 minutes because they have to go to bed now<br>
i know i don't get distracted because i hide myself in my room so no one bothers. who would want to talk to me anyways<br>
and if i were as big of an ass as you i might take time out of my day to go visit some of your wonderfull raids just to wait until you had a sub-par performance so i could smear it all over the boards for you<br>
and yes, you WILL have a bad raid<br>
unless you get your phat lewtz and stop raiding sh~t. but i doubt someone as good as yourself will settle with anything less than the best uberlewt in the game huh<br>
well we'll see how long it is until you're burned out hosting raids<br>
because i know sharia's been at this a Very long time and put up with sh~t from greedy b~tches like yourself<br>
yes there will be one or two in each group of 30 people at a dragon raid .. go figure the only rewards of a dragon raid are loot and fun, and assholes like you make dragon raids less and less fun each time till people only show up for loot. oh wait, is that the only reason you go as it is? you don't care about other people having fun huh? i forgot about that..<br>
see, 20 people dying, 30 people dying, you kill the dragon and its the SAME sh~t in the end<br>
even if your last man standing solo's it and gets the exp<br>
you know that guy had a f~cking BLAST!<br>
so take your uberraids with 2 people or less dying each time and blow them out your f~cking ass. because personally, i'd rather have a fun time where half the people die. than a sh~tty time with 30 people like yourself foaming at the mouth for dragon loot and getting angry when there was more than 5 deaths<br>
wtf is your problem<br>
<br>
anyways, i'll shut up now<br>
you are probably too busy in game organizing some elite raid to come back and read this after you decided to flame someone as hard-working as Sharia<br>
or anyone else that comes out to her raids to kick back and have a good time while she gets a headache trying to organize everything<br>

One reservation a week.  Made in advance.  If a dragon is reserved for that week, and person #2 tried for a reservation...person #2's reservation will get deleted, as the first coming person has the dragon reserved!  <br>
<br>
HOWEVER...the person who reserves the dragon has a grace period to take him down.  If by the end of that grace period they havent done so...then the dragon slides down to the next person waiting in line.  <br>
<br>

I find many things useful on the boards that i have used in game. You are correct I was not invited by Sharia, I asked if she needed help she replied yes so i came. I also agree it is much harder for Vox to die as the location and the area she spawns in is a little more difficult for persons not familiar with dragons. As for my ability or not I never stated that my way was best and it should be judged on how many persons die but a party of 36 with 3 clerics that has 4 deaths seems much more organized than a party of 52 with 6 clerics and 28+ deaths. I always asked Sharia if she needed help getting certain classes as I have many friends in game. Most of the time I was able to help her get clerics and enchanters especially for vox. Could she have gotten these persons without me? Im sure she could have but I may have helped speed the process up. My biggest complaint is that Sharia seems to wait till the last moment before asking anyone. This is something that should be done days before hand so you dont have to worry about taking 6 hours to kill a dragon when nothing is up between the zone and the dragon. <br>
I used to think that it was just Vox is a much harder raid to organize, as i know it is from leading it. But after seeing her organize Naggy raid I knew it was not the camp but the person. Every piece of advice given to her from me and others was totally rebuffed. <br>
Im not sure you know how unorganized this was, I didnt see you there but maybe you were with another character. <br>
As for loot... Do I want uber items like CoF? sure! is it the only reason im there? No! If it was I would reserve the cloak and be done with it. I am there to help persons get items for epics and have fun, not to sit in the throne room of FGs for 4 hours while she makes groups that have only 40% of the persons in the raid in groups. I already have a scale from Naggy so I dont need another. I do know of 10 warriors and 2 bards that did need the scale. If she had said I want the Scale and then taken debates I could have understood it. But she came into the chat room stating the scale was reserved on web page which after checking to see I saw nothing of it being reserved. When confronted she said dont worry about it since I had one already. From my point of veiw this sounds like greed, especially after not letting a harpoon from vox be randomed on. <br>
As for how my raids are ran you are more than welcome to come to em and see for yourself. Have I had raids that crashed? Sure everyone that I know has. I had a Naggy raid fail a few weeks ago when servers were coming down every day. I attribute this to poor orginization. It is much harder to get persons organized in a few hours than a few days. But if you have something reserved for a few weeks ahead of time then getting the persons should be easy. I know sharia has had plenty of time to get raids organized since she had 2 Naggy raids 3 Vox raids and 1 other raid posted as active before her last naggy raid. Where you run into problems is when persons doing there first or 2nd dragon raid sit around for 5 or 6 hours doing nothing they feel that dragons are a waste of time and there not fun anyway. I disagree with this and remeber when taking dragons down were the biggest challenge in the game. They are still fun for me and every character I level I always try to camp the dragons with them just because its fun and I enjoy meeting persons I wuold not normally see in a dungeon. I have made numerous contacts alone through dragons and 3 of my most favorite clerics were met on dragon raids. Its just a game and having fun is what its all about, but if you sit around for 5+ hours doing nothing odds are your not having fun no matter how many persons you talk to.<br>

no, i wasn't at alot of the naggy raid<br>
i was only able to get there near the end<br>
but i have been on many of sharia's raid, and not one has been a failure yet<br>
maybe you're right. some people don't like to sit around for 5 hours<br>
but then again, people quit EQ every day<br>
they find out 90% of the time is just sitting around or running somewhere to sit around<br>
if they figure dragons aren't worth the time then they won't come<br>
i think alot of people reach that point<br>
and until they get in a guild that actually is efficient enough to do dragons without a 5 hour wait, they won't go to any dragon raids. even the ones that take 2 hours. even yours<br>
eventually one of their dragon raids will be 5+ hours, or however long it takes to realize dragons aren't their thing<br>
personally, when i do raids/events i have people ask me ALL the time &quot;how long till it starts,&quot; &quot;how long will it last&quot;<br>
not because it takes me a long time to do things. simply because they value their time differently<br>
everyone has a point at which they get bored. and i'm sure most of them are before your 2 hour raid is up even. so i don't see a very big difference there<br>
it's simply whether or not they want to be there and whether or not they have the time to be there<br>
not, &quot;oh i've been here 5 hours already? jeez i'm leaving&quot;<br>
that rarely happens unless they actually have something important to do<br>
<br>
anyways<br>
52 people is not better than 32 people<br>
52 level 40s, you better expect 20+ people to die<br>
32 level 52s will only have a few deaths<br>
it's the way things are<br>
but you neglected to include that didn't you?<br>
c'mon you're elite raid leader, you should know this<br>
<br>
..it's easy to put down someone else's raid, it's easy to find fault in someone, that's just the way people are<br>
but try to look above that<br>
if someone doesn't want to go &quot;because sharia's leading&quot; then who cares, don't ask em and don't expect em to show up<br>
i'm sure they have their good reason, so leave em be<br>
why come here and practically gloat about it, trying to make your raids look sooo f~cking good<br>
<br>
just look at sharia's win/loss record<br>
then ask yourself<br>
well, if i'm going to go kill a dragon, do i mind waiting a few extra hours with 100% chance i KILL the dragon<br>
or be out of there in 2 hours ... as long as the 50% chance we don't die and have to spend another 3 hours on CR and not even actually kill it...<br>
<br>
*edit*<br>
OOOO, and one more thing!<br>
about the spear from Vox<br>
Sharia asked SEVERAL times<br>
since no one can use it, does Anyone mind if i give it to one of my guild members that really needs it?<br>
and about 7 or 8 people or so /shout'd or /ooc'd sounds great to me<br>
so i ask you<br>
if it was such a big deal<br>
why didn't you say something Then? when she Asked?<br>
hmm, that's what i thought, because you didn't care<br>
or you weren't listening? ahh, well, let's blame Sharia, she didn't send me a tell asking if it was okay with me, if i would have known that i wouldn't have even come...<br>

<br>
I have a few comments to make as far as the raiding situation.  Sharia's raids nearly always end up with the dragon dying and the loot getting distributed.  That's not the point of the discussion.  There are two issues at hand, the first being the efficiency with which she runs her raids, and the second being her loot distribution.  Sorry to butt heads with you Yaen, cause you're a good pal.  But listen before you shake your head :)<br>
<br>
Loot at raids should be intended for those who participated ONLY.  The red scale was reserved for her own PERSONAL use, i.e. she wanted to give it to Psyclops.  I'm not gonna go into familial details, but because the scale was not for HER use it falls under personal loot categories.  This is why I have withdrawn all my support to her raids.  As far as the spear, I sent a tell to Sharia asking her to RANDOM the spear to those at the raid.  Since no one could use, I thought people at the raid could sell it to improve their own gear.  Raids are mutally exclusive.  Todays Vox raid and last weeks are independent, regardless if the same person led the raid.  <br>
<br>
Secondly, let's talk about the efficiency of the raids.  Would you prefer to spend 3 hours sitting doing nothing, and then 2 hours buffing for the raid, OR would you prefer to spend 2 of those 3 hours you were waiting to buff who was there AND NOT RUSH IT??? Those that arrived later could have been individually buffed.  When I arrived at the raid, people were missing symbol and heroism, as well as basic buffs.  That is unacceptable for a raid of this calibre.  Look at the numbers folks.  3 hours is less than 5 hours...Yes, we can count! :)  <br>
<br>
This is not meant as a flame to Sharia or anyone else.  Yes, she could delegate a bit more to make things run faster, but if she wishes to do everything herself, that is how she will run the raid.  I am merely stating my opinions and basing them on factual data.  I have worked with Juggurnaut before and have found him very competent and helpful on the raids I have run in the past.  I'm looking forward to a swift end to Naggy on Thursday, as well as your comments.<br>

i think she likes to be safe and keep everyone in one spot the entire time and buff them all together<br>
instead of logging out 40 people and leave the buffers there waiting for the FGs/IGs to spawn<br>
because who knows how long it's going to take to get those last 5 people to the raid<br>
ESPECIALLY in Perma<br>
takes 20 minutes just to run from the nearest druid/wiz ring<br>
and that's just for 1 person<br>
after you pull all the IGs, who knows how long it's going to take to get everyone there<br>
and realistically, who knows how long it's going to take to get all your people there, who knows how long it'll be before the giants repop. and if you do buff everyone, camp them all out, and giants repop... then everyone has to log back in, kill the giants, then re-buff...<br>
*shrug*<br>
it's all just personal preferance<br>
everyone has their own way of getting it done<br>
bottom line should be whether or not it gets done<br>
not how fast, how few people die, etc.<br>
<br>
just my opinion..<br>
<br>
and as far as you torlan<br>
you're a stubborn person ;o)<br>
that's why you don't want to help Sharia<br>
she has different methods than you. she has no reason to change. you can't stand that someone won't do something your way even if it isn't broken. you back out on helping her<br>
<br>
hey, it's just who we are<br>
but it's also fair to say &quot;if it isn't broken, why fix it&quot;<br>
sure, if someone tries something and it doesn't work, i'd be pissed too if they weren't open to my suggestions<br>
who knows, maybe eventually she'll try it your way, maybe it'll work, maybe not. but if it doesn't, someone's gonna get kicked in the pants =oP <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utitendreadblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Titen Dreadblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/01 5:58:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=766.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re posts</span><hr size=1> just a few last things to add. <br>
1) I did say something about the spear being randomed in OOc. In fact  she seeded for it and it was randomed yet she still chose to keep it. <br>
2) the raid she led had 52 + persons over 30 were over lvl 50 and 20+ were over 51. The group makeups was my complaint. in the charge group were lvl 48 and 49 monks and in 2nd charge group were 52 monks and 52 warriors. Both groups had the same lvl cleric and druid. *scraches head* This is just one example of group I know cause I was in it. I didnt thoroughly examine group makeups but I was well aware of 5 monks on the charge group and 5 warriors in the 2nd charge group. Maybe thats her way of making it but If you put thought into it you can see warriors should always go first as they soak up the most damage and can taunt the best. I am not saying this cause Im playing a warrior now I have played other classes that have done naggy it just makes things work the smoothest.<br>
3) the 5 hours spent sitting the only thing sharia was doing was making groups and waiting on 3 clerics that she knew were coming. After she had announced all groups (6) she asked OOC if she missed anyone. In the 6 groups there were only 3 full. Now simple math states if you have 52 persons and 3 are missing you are still going to have 49 persons and that divided by 6 (amount per group) leaves you with 8 full groups and 1 spare. (unorganized?)<br>
I will try not to post more because I dont feel it is helping the situation. My original post while may seeming like a flame was more of a post to try and lead to discussions of helping persons lead raids more effeciently. I dont expect everyone to run raids like I do or anyone else but if you can learn something from someone else's experience then maybe your next one runs smoother.<br>
