Rekam was twoboxing it with Healaman. Stang, and Phantir were also there. I said LFG for faction, and they told me to come to WL side so I could join and they could at least use my buffs. After about an hour of killing and getting faction, Rekam pulled Liutenent Frostbite I believe, and he dropped silk cap. I figured that since we were here for faction, that loot would be rolled for, for those who needed it. Well, &quot;Phantir loot it!&quot; was said by Rekam. I said, &quot;Are me and Phantir going to roll?&quot; He says, &quot;Sorry NBG.&quot;<br>
... That was all in all pretty lame - Anyone else have bad encounters with Rekam/Healaman? I mean from what I've heard he's a nice guy... but that's just not cool at all.<br>

What should have happened is when you joined group they should have told you if the group was NBG or rollled loot.  Also, in the case of NBG, they should have found out who had the crappier hat and that person should have gotten the loot.  In the future, I guess you just need to ask right up how any loot that drops is going to be handled.  Was this a small mini raid, or just a faction group?  In the case of any kind of small guild raid, with my guild, we always do NBG.  But in the case of a pick up group perhaps, we do rolling. <p>Love<BR>Momma T<BR>59th Templar<BR>LoM Induction Council =)<BR><BR>"And sometimes I think, I'm the only one who feels like going nowhere is like giving up..."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uanthonius2002.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anthonius2002</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/15/02 12:56:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rekam/Healaman</span><hr size=1> Yes, that's what it was.. Rekam and I had mended  our differences when I logged back on. He explained me his position in a mature way, and I told him what I felt about it. Upon telling Leth the situation, it was blown way out of proportion some how. I had gotten defensive and posted our conversation. Hopefully now this post can die, but I feel i've opened a can of worms.<br>
<br>
Again I apologize to Rekam for our miscommunication. He was a really nice guy after, and even offered me more toes and helms for faction.<br>
