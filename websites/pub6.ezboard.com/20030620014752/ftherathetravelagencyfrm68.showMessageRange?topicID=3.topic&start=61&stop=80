<br>
2003 Economy is going downhill.<br>
Solution goto war.(destroy then rebuilt (by US and Brits) contractors.<br>
<br>
War comes down to one thing MONEY like it or not but it is and always will be.Those that think Bush is going to war to liberate Iraqi's is just plain brainless and i mean seriously demented.(<br>
<br>
Goverments don't give a shit bout other countries civilians they care bout their economy no more no less.Thats why they sit there in general to rule their country and for the benefit of X country.<br>
<br>
Spend so far approx 300 Billion dollars,trust me Bush didn't waste your tax money for the people of Iraq.<br>
<br>
And if your president has been put to power by a lot of multinatonals(in the oil ,energy,weapons sector) suporting billions of dollars to put him in the running,you might as well ask yourself the question who is creating this war?<br>
<br>
Bush the puppet or the multinationnals making a shitload a money after (during) the war.<br>
<br>
I don't mind supporting your troops i would do the same ,but i sure as hell won't support the goverment doing this ,so instead of bashing anti war protestors you should cheer them on and not live in denial and focus on 1  or 2 things told by your GOV ,take a deeper look into things and not blindly trust what you hear or see on TV.<br>
<br>
If you think your so called SMART bombs don't kill innocent civilians and Saddam is only killing his own civilians as heard on TV nah,if you drop bombs people die no shit ,even if Dick Cheney is looking into it or CNN says they did it themselves.<br>
You can't drop thousands of bombs and not hit civilians,bombs don't go out of the way yet.<br>
<br>
In my eyes the US and UK or just no better then  Hitler was.<br>
Going to war without the backing of the UN,or world support is fucked up.<br>
<br>
All i see is the US,UK going for $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.<br>
Couldn't they wait for others to approve the war or did the $$$ itched to much they couldn't hold on any longer?<br>
And a lot of people see it this way,not only Arabs the whole fucking globe.<br>
This war is going nowhere and we haven't seen the last load of BS yet.<br>
<br>
Now 90% of Spain is against the war ,all over europe people are heavely against this so called free iraq war (BS) nice prop tho.<br>
<br>
Germans still are being called Nazi's as to date 60 years after the facts,not to my liking but it still happens a lot.<br>
So start preparing for for a lot of US sentiment in the upcoming decenia's .OH well thank you kindly mr Bush fucktard nummero uno!<br>

<br>
Well you're partially right in the fact economics had a lot to do with WWII, but your total spin statement doesn't explain the truth but instead seems to imply the U.S. fought the war for economic reasons.  Wrong.<br>
<br>
Germany was in an economic slump.  Don't forget they lost WWI just 15 years before and their military was almost non-existent.  Adolf Hitler was a charismatic speaker that convinced the Germans that the country could be rebuilt and the military could be revived to what it once was.<br>
<br>
His popularity soared in a few years.  Germans were desperate for a Savior and the Nazi party offered salvation.<br>
<br>

<br>
Actually wars have been fought for many reasons.  Religion has been seen as one of the major reasons.  Politics (socialism vs. capitalism) another.  Sovereignty is another reason (arguments about borders).<br>
<br>
However, you spin it with purely your opinion but you try to base it as fact.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Goverments don't give a shit bout other countries civilians they care bout their economy no more no less.Thats why they sit there in general to rule their country and for the benefit of X country.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
You really are demented thinking this bullshit.  You have been totally brainwashed by propaganda.  That is obvious.<br>
<br>
There is backing in the U.N.  Many Arab countries don't support the coalition because they hate the U.S. and themselves harbor terrorists.  Other countries like France, Germany, Russia and China don't support it because they have a financial investment in Saddam Hussein.<br>
<br>
But as of today, 49 countries are part of the coalition.  Not the &quot;world&quot; as you think, but then again the opposite side isn't the &quot;world&quot; either.  Get your fucking facts straight.<br>
<br>

Yes, they have to do that whenever a camera is near.  Those same people then tell the non-Iraq journalists that they have to say that or Saddam will kill them.  Case in point: a woman who waved at the passing British troops was hanged.<br>
<br>
France not only wants to veto any resolution that the Coalition supports, but wants to be one of the ones to govern/control Iraq after the war is over.  I can guarantee that this is not altruistic since France is already sweating over the several $billion that Iraq currently owes them and the practically free oil that they get now.  They want the control for very, very obvious reasons.  The thing is, their pride is such that although everyone knows their motives, they cannot admit them so this whole farce continues.  It's the lie that you just can't stop although it makes you look like a fool.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That resolution calls for compliance by Iraq, with &quot;serious consequences&quot; if there is non-compliance. At that point the earlier non-compliance issues (non cooperating with inspectors, unaccounted for weapons, etc) became a non-issue. The issue became their present (at that time) compliance. To date, there has been no proof presented by the U.S. (despite Bush, Powell, Rumsfeld, and Blair each stating publicly that &quot;very soon&quot; (several times mind you) they would provide proof, at which point they simply documented the same issues from 1991-199 for this non-compliance.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

According to the UN inspectors after 1441, Iraq had never provided all the documentation or evidence that indicated what happened to many unaccounted weapons.  1441 required this information to be handed to the approrpraite UN officials.<br>
<br>
We all know Saddam had weapons in 1998.  But Saddam wants us to believe that he destroyed these weapons <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>after</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> he kicked out the inspectors?  All I can say is, &quot;Use common sense people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Has Iraq been cooperating since 1441?  My opinion is that except for allowing UN inspectors back into the country, they didn't do jack until the US and UK military started knocking on Saddam's door.  Only then did you see any real cooperation.  But still, it still wasn't the full cooperation that UN inspectors wanted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=joekreeper1>joekreeper1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/2/03 4:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chemical Facility Found </span><hr size=1> I'm sure someone said this before but the US does believe in the inspectors working,<br>

Posting here has it's risks, as most of you over there on the Rathe are americans, and I will not hide the fact I am french. As I played for 2 years on the Rathe, among you, I felt compelled to try exchanging views about the current fucked up situation : I felt especially bound to do so after a incredible poll was published in France showing 33% of the population was wishing SH would win the war.<br>
<br>
I am very distressed by the current tension between the french and US people. Whatever the politicians do on both sides, it kinda sickens me to see we are throwing so much mud on each other. I stayed in the US as a tourist and exchange student, was hosted by very kind american families, had a american GF, and have long time american friends. I just can't stand seeing us ripping each other.<br>
<br>
 Here in France we have a good potion of the public opinion convinced you are fighting a colonisation war to occupy iraq and get it's oil secured and for free. On your side many americans are convinced we were defending SH to secure oil contracts and get bills paid for equipment. <br>
<br>
I did a little fact finding : <br>
The oil company TOTAL drafted a contract with iraq, which wasn't signed, to exploit oil there. It was drafted in the event the embargo would be lifted. We bought petrol from iraq through the UN. The US, last year, bought 50% of the iraqi oil production through the UN. (found that on the department of energy website).<br>
<br>
I can tell you the average frenchman doesn't give a shet about this iraq debt problem. Anti war opinion in France is primarily motivated by a very big taboo which is that a preemptive war is unacceptable. This taboo goes back to the cold war, when everyone knew that the country who would attack another one belonging to the other side of the iron curtain, would risk total destruction of all Europe. <br>
<br>
The french opinion is also very shortsighted about the US at the moment. Reducing the US motivation to a greed motivated war to seize iraq's oil reserves is a very partial view of the real problem. <br>
<br>
It is very comfortable for us french and americans to just ingest the caned dogma our respective media is spewing about the other side, greedy selfish and power grabing. We will not rebuild a good relationship on these basis. <br>
<br>
I am angered by our 2 governements, who were unable to work out an intelligent solution about iraq, and are currently leting their respective public opinions ripping each other to shreds. Bush really was too blunt and arrogant trying to force the UN approval and Chirac , a very talented demagogist, tried to be a 2nd De Gaulle, without the talent and vista his illustrious predecessor had. The net result is that Russia and China are most certainly laughing there heads off seing the western countries in shambles now.  <br>
<br>
Both people will have to rebuild a relationship, it is of paramount importance as the world will be much more fucked up in the future. <br>
<br>
In the meanwhile, I can tell you I sincerely hope you win the war with the less casualties both for your soldiers and the civilians there. I hope your troops will not have to stay there for peacekeeping for too long as I fear you will encounter many problems with suicide bombers and guerilla fighters. The best thing would be to void all the existing oil contracts the SH governement had signed be they russian, french or whatever. Then the UN could step in and administer iraq, fund rebuilding with every nation giving money. The contractors would be chosen on pure technical and economical criterias, without any regard to their nationality. A part of the funding raised could be channeled to the US and UK as a participation to their war effort.<br>
<br>
Then all the western countries will have to press their efforts onto the arab/israel problem to force a peaceful solution as i believe it is the true cancer that is destroying the middle east.<br>
And we ll need the combined strenght of the US and Europe to do that.<br>

 When I spoke German, Croation, or Spanish the people were generally pretty nice, but as soon as I spoke English  OMG did people's attitude change!<br>

I have nothing agianst the French people.<br>
<br>
However, the problem I had against the French government was their refusal to admit that military force might be needed. It seemed they would rather allow non working disarmament procedures go on indefinitely.<br>

This is probably true, but keep in mind that the majority of the US's oil does not come from the Middle East.  Here's a quick little quote:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>U.S. Oil Imports <br>
According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the United States imports 58 percent of its oil - or over 11 million barrels per day (with total consumption approaching 20 million barrels per day). The reliance on imports is necessary and carries benefits as well as some risks.<br>
<br>
Sources of U.S. Imports<br>
<br>
The United States imports oil from many different countries. This makes it easier to adjust to a temporary interruption in oil supplies from any one country or region. <br>
<br>
The United States imports 9.9 percent of all the oil it consumes from Canada, more than from any other nation. It imports 7.9 percent from Saudi Arabia and 7.8 percent from Mexico. It imports 2.2 percent from Iraq1. All Persian Gulf nations together supply only 11.5 percent of the oil the United States consumes.<br>
<br>
As a group, the other OECD nations import more oil than the United States (about four million barrels more per day), and some nations, such as Japan, import all or almost all of their oil2.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.apiinformation.org/factsheets/oil_imports.html" target="top">www.apiinformation.org/factsheets/oil_imports.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
Also, remember that if we really wanted Iraq's oil, we could have taken it during the first Gulf War.<br>

I understand where you're coming from.  The fate of mankind pretty much relied on two countries.  As long as those two countries could keep from annihilating each other, the world would be ok.<br>
<br>
However, today there are more then just those 2 countries which makes the situation worst.  Now there is a fear that psychotic people, who will be more likely to use such weapons, have access to these weapons.  The question everyone needs to ask themselves is: Do we wait for the missles to rain down on our cities, or do we try to stop it before hand?<br>
<br>
Preventive action must be taken, because with today's weapons we can't afford to wait for a city of people to be annihilated.  We must move from a defensive stance, to an offensive stance.<br>
<br>
It will only take 1 guy with a nuclear weapon to destroy most of Paris.  How do you defend against something like that?  Sure you can increase security, but there is always a chance that one person would be able to get by it.  The answer is that you can't defend against it.  You got to stop the guy before he aquires the weapon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ozzone>Ozzone</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.noble-blade.net/forums/uploads/av-46.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/5/03 1:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chemical Facility Found </span><hr size=1> Nuking Paris is a waste of good plutonium. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=140009" target="top">Ozzone - Noble Blade</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
