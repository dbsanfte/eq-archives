<br>
1.  Already having all the plane gear:  This will never be true of FoR.  We have waves of people becoming planeable, currently planeable and obtaining gear, and retiring already having obtain plane gear.  Things just sort of evolved this way with us being a large alliance rather than a single guild.  This is probably one thing that FoR is different on from KEG, CIW, and BOTS.<br>
<br>
2.  FoR reserving a plane for two days.  Well, our current estimate for planeable FoR toons is about 100 to 120 ppl.  While FoR may be in a plane for two days, most of the people will be different on the two days.  While we will have some core people make both raids, may others will not get to go both days but have to rotate out.  So in any one raid signup, we have some necessary people who go both days, some who get to go one day but not the other, and then we still have some that don't get to go at all.<br>
<br>
Now on the BB guild/alliance quailification, I feel like others here that clearing isle 6 including the boss and obtaining the keys to move on to isle 7 should be the requirement.  Those who have been there and done it know that isle 6 is quite a bit harder than isle 5.  </font><P>Xantarran {Black Talons},

Now 2 more alliances(guilds) clear island 5 OR 6.  Seems ppl changing their mind for some reason even when they have agreed to island 5 already.  Soon 2 more BB's are in with 2 days.  What happens when we get 10 BB's(big brothers btw)?  That is 20 days taken up on the calendar with 10 left for others.  What you can see is that soon we will be back to the &quot;everyone has 2 days in the planes&quot; type BS that we had before.<br>
<br>
Don't think others won't clear island 6.  It is a goal of our next Air raid to be sure.  I am sure others have the same goal.<br>
<br>
Everyone agrees to the proposed plan except the 2 day rule.  I just see it as being a problem in the making and would rather see it left out.  If there were less entities posting then it wouldn't be as big a problem.  But if we have 30 entities posting there just is no room to allow a few guilds/alliances to post 2 days.<br>
<br>
I think we need to push an agreement through and work on getting the calendar back in order.  Take off the 2 day rule(even though I feel our guild would benefit from it soon) and lets try and be fair to everyone out there.  The BB guilds will have more shots at gods without having to post 2 days in the planes.<br>
<br>
The problem is this!!  Focus right here on these 2 paragraphs.  Everyone is crying out to get more plane dates SOONER.  When we get more and more BB's then that SOONER becomes terms more suited for geological clocks.  And you CANNOT keep pushing the bar up to suit your Gdamn needs.  If you agree to this NOW, you can't say, &quot;oh wait too many big brothers lets push the bar up again so only guilds who can kill Trakanon will be big brothers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fact is when more big brothers come on the scene with 2 day postings then we are back to square one.  Lets have some vision please.  You got the epic quest calendar, you have the chance at your epic quest items more often.  Lets go with that idea and run with it.<br>
<br>
I hope everyone can understand this,<br>

<br>
Originally, we all could have 2 days and it was dropped to just a single day because there were just too many guilds.  I can see it returning to this state relatively quickly.<br>
<br>
In addition, for BotS, KEG, and Icewind, the additional day pretty much becomes a twink-fest.  Most of the mains have their gear and so much of the loot will go to secondaries, people that joined the guild just to get loot, or guests.  The main reason these guilds will want to book 2 days?  Epic quest loot.  But the Big Brother provisions are already there to get them more of that.  There really is no reason for double booking.  Especially when you consider that KEG is at what, 50 members?  10 over the limit to sign up.  That's it.  Just because they can handle the 5th island in Sky doesn't justify giving them an extra planar day when the majority of their own people already have planar gear.  Now, don't get me wrong, I know that KEG will invite people along, things won't rot, etc.  But it's the principle of the thing.  There is no justification for a guild that qualifies as Big Brother to get two days in fear or hate.<br>
<br>
Combine this with other guilds achieving big brother status (and my guess is that within a month or two, you'll have 2 or 3 more big brothers), we'll quickly end up with a situation which we just recently left.  Raising the bar isn't right either.  Either you are good enough to be a Big Brother now under the current standards or you aren't.  If the plan is to eventually up it to be that you must have killed Trakanon, visited isle 7, and killed VS... then that is the level the bar should be set at now.  From the beginning.  And if that means that Icewind, RoF, and KEG (hmmm, has BotS killed VS yet?) don't qualify right away, then so be it.  They might eventually, but the standards which judge their admittance should be the same as anyone else's.  Plan long term, don't plan for short term to fulfill your own greedy desires.  <br>
<br>
If it's a problem that there will be lots of big brothers later, then the only problem that exists is that the big brothers get too much.  After all, the goal of the Big Brother program is to ensure that epic quest mobs don't go to waste, right?  As long as that goal is met, to change it for any other reason would seem to indicate that it exists to feed the greed of certain guilds.<br>
<br>
I don't really care if you have tons of people becoming planar.  That's the price you pay for your size.  Again, you could form a new alliance of guilds that don't qualify for BB status with the exact same number of members and not qualify for 2 days... then neither should a BB.  If you want more planar days and have 150+ peeps, well, you can split and go your own way.  If it encourages a few people not to apply to a big guild because the line is too long to get loot, so much the better.  More people for the smaller/medium guilds, less people interested primarily in loot for the big boys.<br>
<br>
I'll support this proposal simply because it's better than chaos... but I'd like it much better without the 2 day crap... or at least, with only allowing BB's to schedule 3 days in hate/fear total, 2 in one, 1 in the other.  And I strongly advocate that whatever the conditions for joining the Big Brother club are, that they be set in stone, never to change, to keep it true to it's principles of max utilization and not pervert it to an institution established to feed the greed of a few.<br>

The way Bradan wrote this was based on the number of posting entities.  At this point in time no one is absolutely sure on the exact number of posting entities but i'm pretty sure it is at least 30ish.  <br>
<br>
The next step would seem to me to be establishing posting entities.  With few exceptions, 36-40 seems to be the number agreed upon for the ability to post dates.  Once we have a number of posters it's not hard to see if there will be extra days or not.  If there are no extra days, then the whole clause in the proposal is a null point.  I would ask the admins to please start to assemble a list of posters.  If i can be a service in anyway i would be more than happy to in order to support Rathe.<br>

Thanks for reading.<br>
<br>
***CIW, KEG, BOTS, and FOR propose the following...***<br>
<br>
I think we need to have more representation out there. =)<br>
<br>
<br>
***Revamp the posting entities. Atleast 40 planeable toons per entity, <br>
whether it be by guild or by alliance.***<br>
<br>
While, I think 40 at any plane raid is a bit much, but I am willing to accept this idea.  Heck, we have 71 planeable toons already.  I kind of think 30 is a more reasonable number.<br>
<br>
***Abolishment of the 2/3 rule.***<br>
<br>
Sure thing.<br>
<br>
*** If an entity has the 40 planeable toons, <br>
they invite who they please with a maximum of 6 people from any one guild.***<br>
<br>
No, I don't agree.  I know it sounds fair on paper, but it is too controlling.  I would say that if the number of invites equalled or exceeded the number of actual guild members there, then we would have issues, but 6 is too nit picky.  OMG I have 7 invites!?!?  You see what I mean?  I think it's too low, and there's no justification as to why only 6.  What if GuildA brough 40 of their guild to the planes, is  7 invites even close to abusing the system?  This does not make sense.  I would say if the invites exceed 40% of the current population in the plane, then that would be abuse.  Easier to set it at a percentage than any static number. =)<br>
<br>
***If there continues to be abuse of this calendar it will be brought up for public review with possible actions taken against the abuser.***<br>
<br>
I like that...gets the community involved.<br>
<br>
<br>
***Plane of Fear/Hate:***<br>
<br>
***KEG, FOR, CIW, BOTS be allowed to post 2 days per plane either <br>
consecutive or non-consecutive assuming those days are available vrs the number of posting entities.<br>
Other entities be allowed to post 1 day per plane.***<br>
<br>
This is wrong.  The issue we have all be fighting for is not extra concessions, whether they would ever exist or not, it's for EQUAL rights to the planes, and no waste.  This rule does not cover either base.  Fear and Hate are one day raids to all, regardless, the epic calendar can take of those who need to help the smaller guilds kill Inny or what not.  <br>
<br>
****Its our goal here to be able to get 2 days per plane a month for <br>
KEG, FOR, CIW, BOTS and 1 day per plane a month for other entities.<br>
This will vary depending on how many entities we get after it gets revamped.<br>
It could work out to more than that per month, or it could work out a <br>
little less.***<br>
<br>
It is my goal to keep things fair for all guilds, and this does not work.  Sorry, but your main argument has been waste and abuses to the system.  This is an abuse, and does not provide the solution to your problem with waste in the planes, in fact, considering you have stated that most of your members are full planes gear, this actually causes waste.  Oh yeah, invite rule, hehe, didn't you suggest only 6 invites?  ACK, a contradiction.  What if none of the 6 invites needed a plane item that dropped.  Waste.<br>
<br>
***Plane of Sky<br>
In order to maximize weekend enjoyment of the plane of sky, we propose<br>
the following:<br>
FRI/SAT postings<br>
SAT/SUN postings<br>
Meaning, if you have fri/sat reserved, you are entitled to islands 1 - 4 on friday,<br>
with saturday giving you islands 5+.<br>
The next guild that has sat/sun reserved will be entitled to islands 1 - 4 on saturday and 5+ on sunday, and so on.***<br>
<br>
Question, on this one.  Who is entitled to the fri/sat sat/sun postings?  Just need a clarification before I see a reason to agree.  RoS has been to Sky once, we started late, and went to 4 before we got pooped.  I am more than sure we will get to 5 and beyond soon enough, so I worry less about your &quot;qualifications&quot;, but I do want to know this more for the other guilds that want to experience Sky.<br>
<br>
<br>
***Big Brother***<br>
<br>
Probably needs rewording hehe, it's got an ominous tone to it, hehe.<br>
<br>
***Rotation Schedule between KEG, CIW, FOR, BOTS<br>
For the guilds who know they cannot kill Cazic/Innoruuk/Maestro,<br>
KEG, FOR, CIW, BOTS will be on call to assist in killing these mobs<br>
in exchange for the epic quest items. This is by invite only.****<br>
<br>
Fine by me, I think this was one of the major concessions we were willing to give.  Beyond that, no.  <br>
<br>
****If any guild knows they cannot complete epic quests, and agree that <br>
those items sitting in a bank rotting a way is a waste. It would be <br>
greatly appreciated if they would also use the big brother rotation<br>
schedule to have them loot the epic quest item.Your choice.****<br>
<br>
Fair enough.<br>
<br>
***Once a guild has cleared to Island 6 in sky(Bzzt island), they will be <br>
added to the list in this rotation assuming they choose to do so.<br>
**<br>
<br>
Fair enough as well.<br>
<br>
***All other calendar rules will remain the same and be eligible to change in the future due to the circumstances. those rules proposed to be changed will be discussed in an adult manner AT that time.***<br>
<br>
Eligible for future change by whom?<br>
<br>
***IF you are in agreement to this proposal and we can carry this forward and get the calendar up and running again please state your guild below if you are an authorized representative of your guild.***<br>
<br>
While I am not THE representative of my guild to approve or disapprove, I am going to have to say that ME, Siffu does not approve, although it does look like many of us officers are feeling the same way.<br>
<br>
I think it revolves around the concessions being made.  While, we were all willing to agree to the Epic quest concession to eliminate waste, we were never in favor of any guild getting extra days.  Oh, Yes, I am fully aware of the stated IF clause, but it goes against the spirit of the calendar.  Truth be known, there will be no IF.  There are too many people to have &quot;extra days&quot; given to anyone.  <br>
<br>
Lets infringe on others raids by allowing for the epic quest calendar, but lets begone with the &quot;extra day&quot; rubbish, bad idea.  I really don't want arguments about IF there is a day, as stated above, it's the principle behind the matter, and it has already got many, whose nerves are already rattled, feeling itchy trigger fingers again.  Lets keep it fair, just fair.<br>

Basicly the point of contention is fairly clear here, everyone else is basicly saying the same thing.<br>

So no Qwai it is not as simple as aprove or disaprove, as a whole we disaprove of it because there is part of the proposal that is unfair, strike that and many more will aprove of the idea.<br>

<br>
How is it fair that guilds/alliances that have discovered how to break planes, Gods and dragons - and have 60 to 120+ planable members, have as many days as guild X with 20 planable members and 20 invitees. Right now these guilds/alliances could each break into 2 or even 3 new guilds and STILL be able to clear a plane and God.<br>
<br>
How is it fair that epic quest items for several class quests (warrior, necro, magicians are examples), will rot in a bank FOREVER because dreamers that have no chances of completing these quests loot these items. The Queen in Chardok has NEVER been defeated on our server. How many of us will be able to within 2 months, or 6. Do you think BOTS, CIW, KEG or FoR won't be first?<br>
<br>
How is allowing very accomplished guilds/alliances helping out guilds/alliances that cannot take a God out a &quot;consession???&quot; while the offer has already been made NOT to loot ANY non epic quest items.<br>

Why not sum up your phrasing?  How fair is it that we have to work together to make things equal for all sides?  We have killed gods and dragons and can easily split into two guilds to do this, and are trying, in vain, to let you know that many others can do the same.  Hate to break the news to you guys, but you four guilds are not the only ones out there that can do, or are close to doing what you are all doing.  CIW, wasn't it through KEG and MFH that you got where you are?  I don't see MFH belly-aching about not getting extra days.  Hrmmm.  <br>
<br>
Wait, I have seen the future if this proposal passes.  RoS clears island 6.  OMG, Noble House cleared island six.  Oh no, Spirit of Tunare has done it, and Knights of the Phoenix.  KIC is now clearing it.  That makes five more guilds to add to the list.  ACK!  Well, island sic must not be THAT hard.  Maybe we should change it so they have to clear island seven?  Yeah, that's it.  D'oh two of them did?  Well, umm, well they have to kill Trak seven times to prove their worth....etc.  <br>
<br>
Enough is enough.  We agree to all the proposal, save the &quot;extra day&quot; stuff, and I personally would like some clarification of the &quot;Future Changes&quot; and who is to be reserving the fri/sat sat/sun Sky raids.  Other than that, I think we are golden.  I think you giving up that one little section will work wonders.  Oh, and if you are tired of us holding up our 10$ a month proclaimation of equal rights, something I actually haven't done, BELIEVE me, I am equally tired of you holding up your war trophies and demanding we bow to your will.  Just dust the rule, clarify it up a bit, and I think we can proceed to get things moving forward again. =)  Not too much to ask, is it?</font><P><html><body>

From reading the many posts, the only thing people have a problem with is the extra day. Drop it, and you seem to have a good plan here. <br>
Aeg, you say how are all the guilds supposed to be treated equal? That yours has done so much, and should be treated better? Bah. That is the exact attitude that freezes up the gears of this board. I have watched Bradan and others offer some great ideas here. Dont muck it up with personal pride. Yes KEG, Bots, CIW, and FoR have done some amazing things in this server, but you were not always that strong. You grew to power because you wanted it bad enough, and had nobody surpressing you. Now you want to surpress those that have the same chance you did. I tend to agree more with Bradan and the others. Treat all the guilds/alliances fairly, and equally. Do that, and things will be much smoother. You will always have someone not happy, but you cant please everyone. Do the best that can be done to be fair and impartial. You dont need two days a month in Fear/Hate to get the epic loot. You will be getting plenty of extra chances from the smaller guild/alliances that cant take the gods. You are making out like kings there. So take what you have here and run with it.<br>

The current rule is outdated and worthless due to the number of planable people on the server. If you increase the rule from what it is now (I think it was like 12 or something) to 40 (36-42), you'll clear up a lot of dates because Guild A won't be inviting part of Guild B to their raid anymore, both Guilds will have to ally with each other. 2-4 dates gone from the calendar (hate/fear/air).<br>
<br>
I'm quite sure there are a lot of alliances/guilds out there with 36 or pretty much close to that planeable toons. <br>
How many guilds on the rathe have 12-15 planeables and are posting on the calendar, AND inviting other posting guilds who also have 12-15 planeables? That is some of the abuse which some are trying to weed out from the calendar.<br>
<br>
Adding a min. planeables rule &gt; 36 would clear up a lot of dates on the calendar IMHO.<br>
<br>
Bradan, I can see where you are coming with the extra planes dates if they are available. And with the calendar Rewenna is developing it shouldn't be too much of a problem, that I foresee. Since you'd simply have:<br>
Entity[1..24] (with 36+ planeable toons) [E]<br>
Epic Enitity[1..4] (4 for now) [EE]<br>
EE is included as an E.<br>
<br>
Everyone in E books their dates for say January, there are dates left over, the EE group pick up remaining dates, a day a piece (and keeping within the current rules as well). It would be a rare sight indeed to have an extra date for EE, but it could happen. The extra date would simply be for training indie's and non-posting guilds, etc. and also give the EE group another chance at Epic quest drops. The indie's and non-posting guilds would loot any drops, yadda yadda.<br>

<br>
Oh forgot to answer this question.  Simply put, if there was no epic calendar, the next guild to get the plane, more than likely, would kill the god.  So, in fact, your &quot;helping&quot; the smaller guilds kill a god, does little or no good to the other guilds that can.  This is why it is a concession.  It only helps you and those smaller guilds who cannot kill the god.  Comprende?<br>

So I am kind of disapointed by the lack of attempt by everyone to step up to the bargaining table.  This is a tool right now.  This is not the set in stone we will not move &quot;document&quot;.  It's a proposal, lets work on it.<br>
<br>
I think everyone needs to go grab a few beers and chill.  Let me remind you that giving up now would be a huge mistake and would just be a huge waste of time that people have put into this.  BOTH sides need to step up and look at the others arguments.  Quit nit picking.<br>
<br>
Lets look at the &quot;problems&quot; people have.  Kind of silly really as they are not that huge.<br>
<br>
Limiting the posting of the guilds to 40 or more planable toons.  Some want this 30.  Lets look at this.  This is not 30 toons from the same guild in the plane during that raid persay.  This is 30 planable toons TOTAL in that posting entity whether its a guild or alliance.  30 is too low some say.  You have no shows, work, RL, computer problems and you come to the planes and dont have enough to clear it.  That is the point for having 40.  Its not 50 or 60 like I bet some would like to see.  40 is fair and reasonable.  Lets agree to it and move on.<br>
<br>
Invites cannot go over 6 from another guild.  This is prob just worded a bit wrong IMO.  Perhaps a percent should be added.  Perhaps there should be no limit to invites as long as you are the major force in the plane.  What needs to be watched I guess is if you are always asking for help from others and only are able to bring 12 players from your guild and invite the rest.  Ya a plane can be cleared with 18 been there done that with 13 before.  But looking back its not productive.  And I see the points the larger guilds bring up that that is a wasted day 9 times out of 10.  What other guilds are getting mad at is someone with 10 players from the posting guild and having 30 in the plane.  If ya can't field the players from your entity why are you posting seperate?  Why are you posting at all?  THAT is the biggest gripe from ANY guild I think.  So this is really a silly nit picking point right?  Reword it and move on.<br>
<br>
Third and final gripe is the second day rule.  Again, why not just be big brother for the guilds who have hard times killing maestroe.  Who have hard times pulling the drakes in Hate.  Who don't even have a FA on one of their guildies yet who don't need the though invoker/corrupter(can't remember).  If these are the quest items you want they can be got by doing the Big Brother system.  I see the reason for the second day but it is not keeping true to the reason you want it.  Plus I see more problems coming from a second day then the good it will give you guys if we do concede and give it to you.  So I would vote no just for that reason even though I feel our guild would be in that second day calendar soon.  Lets talk this over more and let each side explain themselves fully.  Leave the flamethrower home today.  This is a discussion board.<br>
<br>
So who is going to be man enough to step up and discuss this?  I know Bradan is simply burnt out.  He has been working his ass off for this.  He needs a break.  Jerrica is right, quit nit picking this to death and start saying, ok this is not exactly what I want but its close.  If ya want a number bumped suggest it.  Maybe you will get a valid reason why it should be the way it is.  Again this is a proposal.  Right?  Or am I wrong and both sides won't move to an agreement?<br>

<br>
You require 40 planable members to post on Calendar.<br>
The guilds that have 40+ planable members are the ones that can kill the Gods - or think they can.<br>
They will never call in a &quot;Big Brother&quot; guild...<br>
<br>
By raising the number to 40, you eliminate the smaller guilds and alliances that are the most likely to call in a Big Brother guild. By pushing the bar higher to 40 planable toons, you will virtually eliminiate any chance of being called in for a God.<br>
<br>
And... if the call is made NOT to call in a Big Brother guild, chances are the guild with the plane the next day will be able to kill the God.<br>
<br>
Also, I agree with other peoples comments concerning 2 days for the &quot;Big Brother&quot; guilds in the normal planes. They posted on numerous occassions that they didn't need the plane loot, but the FA loot off the Gods... so how did 2 days for Big Brother creep into the rules? Just wondering... I need to read the posts above in detail. That is a thought that came to me though.<br>
<br>
I put forth, that by raising the min num of planable toons to 40 people, you eliminate the need for a Big Brother system. As you have eliminated the guilds that cannot kill the Gods...<br>
<br>
What are peoples thoughts?<br>

First of all, stop trying to name certain entities and set them apart from others based on name/reputation alone.  The past is the past.  If you want to propose a set criteria, then lots of guilds are going to meet it in very short order, not just four.  There are probably another half-dozen guilds of a size that is larger than one or more of the &quot;Big Brothers&quot; proposed in terms of planes level characters.  What are you going to propose when they all proceed to clear Island 5/6/whatever within a month of this going out? <br>
<br>
Yep, some of the 4 guilds mentioned helped &quot;bust&quot; the planes.  That was over a year ago.  Get over it.  A simple matter of time and trial-and-error tactics.  The guilds with people who (a) had lots of free time to devote, and (b) had a drive to do things first and/or get all the loot first naturally did these things first.  This in no way means that any number of other guilds and players could not have done the same thing over time.  Adding just one of the largest of these up-and-coming guilds to your list does not solve anything, although it has silenced that particular guild's calls for fairness, which is pretty sad.<br>
<br>
The situation on The Rathe now is one of several large guilds trying to hold on to what they enjoyed in the past, while a slew of guilds inevitably catches up to them.  There will be 20+ guilds capable of doing some or all of these quests by Xmas.  Get used to it, and quit trying to eke out that last little elite spot for yourselves.  This is a game after all, and you're making yourselves and all us arguing over these &quot;precious resources&quot; look pretty silly.  It's even funnier since Velious will be out in 2 months and you'll all be fighting over whichever uber-loot zone is identified first, just like you did for Kunark.<br>
<br>
The proposals that do not make any special allowances for any particular named guild, but only make allowances based on proven guild size or measurable capabilities are the right ones.  Take your names out of it and let's get back to playing.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uscytheeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ScytheEQ</A> at: 11/5/00 1:53:17 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufoladen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>foladen</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>59</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11/5/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>2:42:33 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">some inflection from this side.</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Allow to me inject some thinking from both viewpoints. On one side, from a guild that has been posting planes raids for only 3 or 4 months so i understand the frustration of the smaller guilds and on the other hand from one of the larger guilds on the server.<br>
<br>
The 40 toon rule should pass for now. Its simply a matter of logistics people. The rathe is overpopulated with hi lvls. This gives room for more posting dates. Concessions need to be made for now. Once velious is out and those 2 planes are active then we can discuss it again. But right now i vote yes for this.<br>
<br>
After much thought and consideration on the 2 day rule I vote no. the idea of unclaimed days going for training of those unguilded or needing help would be wonderful, but already by a few posts i see i know that some will not do that but instead just keep it for a 2nd planes day for themselves. there is just too much room for abuse there. <br>
Im not saying all will abuse this, so please dont get me wrong but when i read posts arguing for it saying we deserve more from the context of the posts....well that puts up a big red light. To those who wish to really use the day for what KEG is proposing i apologize but i cannot vote for this at this time. No one deserves special treatment. If set rules preventing the abuse of this suggested 2nd day can be posted and abusers lose right to 2nd day i will gladly vote yes. <br>
<br>
The isle 6 clear to be big brother guild i agree to.<br>
