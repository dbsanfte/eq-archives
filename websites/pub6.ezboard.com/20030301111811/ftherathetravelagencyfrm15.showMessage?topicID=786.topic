<br>
Ok guys.. If you dont want a spoiler.. then Dont read this post. Some of this will piss alot of people off because it wasnt what we all expected when it came to Planar AA EXP. <br>
<br>
WARNING: This was confirmed by 2 beta players but this does not mean its written in stone. However I talked to them today on the phone so if anything is going to change, its going to be quick. I strongly suggest not to spend any AA points until you log in when POP goes live to make sure all this is REALLY true. I dont want to be responsible for wasted AA points. <br>
<br>
This is going to hurt the player that put most of his or her points in General and ALT Exp, but could have put points in class. This will better help you understand why Varent does not want you to bank more then 30 points. This will also help you understand why the Key Rings were made. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PLANAR GENERAL/ABILITIES: How to use and unlock. <br>
<br>
<br>
Planar General <br>
-------------- <br>
This is the normal section and will be the 4th window in your AA Ability Section. AT MINIMUM you will need level 61 and 24 points in class to unlock this window. Basicly you must be an Exarch. As if you were progressing from Arch to Class you needed 12 to move forward. NOw you need 24 to move foward to Planar General. <br>
<br>
Planar Abilities <br>
----------------- <br>
This screen will be the 5th window in the AA Ability Section. However you WILL NOT need to spend X amount of points in Planar General to unlock it. However you will need the minimum listed above to use it. To get these abilities you will need a huge mixture of things spent in the correct ways to unlock abilities to train in. This is good and bad for everyone. Good for those that now have the ability to path the way they want to go with there abilities. Bad for those who already spent 70 points and hit a brick wall. <br>
<br>
An example of what you would need to train in &quot;Advanced Casting Reinforcement&quot; would be: <br>
<br>
Level 61 <br>
24 in Class Section <br>
Casting Reinforcement 1,2 and 3 <br>
Improved Casting Reinforcement <br>
This will unlock the Advanced Casting Reinforcement <br>
<br>
Some General and Abilities require no prereq's. They simply require a level and the minimum in class. For instances Some abilities that have 3 trainable levels will allow you to train at levels 61, 63 and 65. <br>
<br>
Basicly what this ALL boils down to is.. If you are a Baron/Venerable 60th level Cleric.. you Ding 61 the moment you log in.. You WILL NOT be able to use planar abilities. You MUST spend 24 in class and get that Exarch title. <br>
<br>
Varent did say this is expansion is for the very high level player. This only further backs up there claim. They are trying to seperate the players. <br>
<br>
As with the game from the start a level 60 cleric was always more desireable then a level 55 cleric. Now everyone seems to blend. <br>
<br>
Now it will be: <br>
<br>
Planar 65 Cleric &gt; Venerable 65 Cleric <br>
<br>
I personaly agree with this. <br>
<br>
<br>
OK.. now for some fun stuff. <br>
<br>
1. Stats will will be capped at 305. Im unsure if this also means tradeskills. However, you must train in a planar general skill called &quot;Planar Power&quot;. This will lift your cap by 5 points per training level. You can train in this skill for a total of 10 times and only twice per level. You can start training at level 61. Again you must have 24 in class to start this. <br>
<br>
2. The Plane of Knownledge will be your &quot;Nexus&quot; of planes. This is where all your quests will be and most of your other plane ports. <br>
<br>
3. Most planes will require a Key. These will be small sub quests. This is why we got our keyring. We dont need to hold 15 keys in our backpaks <br>
<br>
4. Most zones are single zones. A Few planes have sub zones. <br>
<br>
5. Some zones have things you have never experienced before. For instance the plane of disease has a vs disease check the moment you zone in and walk around. The very air around you will do damage to you. /auction WTB vs Disease gear <br>
<br>
6. We have something called an ARCH quest. Its a quest that is the most uber of uber quests that will take every zone do accomplish. I am unsure exactly what the item is but its progressive and each part you complete will yeild a better item (i.e like shawl/ring quest in Velious). Some of the mobs will require 2 mega guilds to take down (i.e. Solsek). <br>
<br>
7. Epic v2.0 is live and is in game. Its a quest you cannot start until you have your epic. You must hand in your epic (you get right back) to start the quest. I am unsure of how hard this is, if it can be MQ'ed, and if its as long as the 1st. <br>
<br>
8. Druids and wizards will only have ports to Plane of Knownledge. Every other plane will be accessed from the other or through the Plane of Knownledge. Again, most will need keys. There is some speculation about the keys and the Arch quest being one thing. <br>
<br>
9. Foci level 3 items WILL NOT cover spell levels 61-65. Those of us that have Improved damge 3 or Mana perservation 3 items GET RID OF THEM NOW the bottom will fall out of those come Foci Level 4. If you ever said to yourself 'If i only knew'.. guess what now you do. THIS i know to be true because test servers have Foci level 4 effects that went live couple days ago. <br>
<br>
So all and all.. This is nothing more then a HUGE bump and grind expansion. I have no idea why Varent said its not. It seems that way to me. <br>
<br>
I spoke with 2 seperate beta testers and they both said pretty much the same thing.<br>
<br>
troll, or cold hard truth? you decide. <p><p><center><img src="http://www.vofguild.com/images/dalzielsig.jpg" align=middle><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=273789>Equipment Profile</a><BR>"Give a man a fire and he's warm for a day, but set fire to him and he's warm for the rest of his life."<BR>"Fear not Fair maiden!
