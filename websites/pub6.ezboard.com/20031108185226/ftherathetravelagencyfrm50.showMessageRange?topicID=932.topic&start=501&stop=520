You act like all the other rotations in the past weren't set up this way.  They were.  Just because they were done in PRIVATE tells or in a PRIVATE chat channel doesn't make any difference.  How is a PRIVATE chat channel different from a PRIVATE forum on a message board?  Here's a little hint:  It is not.<br>
<br>
Stop being such a purposeful antagonist, and give it up.<br>
<br>
You are not making an argument.  All the fact support what I have just said.  NOBODY but the guilds that have killed the content that is TO BE ROTATED has access to the rule making process, NO MATTER WHAT MEDIUM THEY CHOOSE TO MAKE THE RULES IN.<br>
<br>
I don't understand why you don't understand that, nor why you feel that a different medium of discussion has any change on your or anyone else's rights on this server.<br>
<br>
I think you are enjoying the arguing for the sake of arguing.  It's too bad you haven't made a worthwhile  point yet though. <p><P><br>

He's called for reps here to demand a vote, Triv's asked the reps in the game channel to respond, none cared enough to do so.  <br>

Give me a solid, logical, rational FACT I can use to explain away all of the elitist bullshit I see happening, the exploitation of powers that certain people do not have, the theft of authority from the RTA Representatives into the hands of 3 people who clearly are not acting in interest to the RTA community. <br>
<br>
Just think of me as the lone crusader against the alien pod-people who have taken over the RTA, if it helps you to do that.  You don't really care anyways, do you Jurrasic?<br>

The set of folks who should be allowed to vote are the reps who already have access to the EP forum.  This is because it is their choice whether or not their discussions should be made public.  No one else's choice.  Seeing as how the forum was created for the EP guilds at their request and is not public, I take that as enough of a vote.<br>
<br>
The main problem here is Rigorre seems to think the RTA is empowered with much more than it is.  The RTA is a message board provided for discussion.  Other than that, there is nothing that it does.  It is a common meeting place - plain and simple, nothing more, nothing less.  Until this is understood and the misconception that the RTA is some governing body that has some unknown list of powers and follows some unknown committee rules, this fruitless thread will continue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Spin Doctor <br>

Ahh, see thats where you are wrong.  When most rotations are formed for the first time there is no public access to it whatsoever.  Why would BotS and Tindi put anything about their personal rotation in the Guild Rep forum before other guilds that have access to the forum get there?  Guess what?  They don't.  They work out their psuedo-rotation privately, and don't involve guilds who don't need to be meddling in something they have never seen let alone understand.<br>
<br>
Get over yourself.<br>
<br>
Also, have you seen the rotations page lately?  Some elemental things have crept up on there.  Have a look-see. <p><P><br>

The creations of rotations have been kept private in the past to avoid giving out spoilers.  No new rotations have ever been created using the Rep forums, only modifications to existing rotations.<br>

I did not bring that argument to the table, they did.<br>
___________________________________________________<br>
<br>
It has been my experience that people who want to have their voice heard will make it heard.  I have seen small civil discussions in the rep forum be brought over to the general forum and form huge threads there (for example, Plane of Hate a couple months ago).  That is peoples desire to give input to a situation that should be handled by the reps.  And that's why I support a private forum, past experience with public, non-posting forums.<br>

You see? There is no law of privacy here ...there isn't even a law of precedence that you can point to granting privacy. Discussions of rotations have ALWAYS been done in the RTA and they have ALWAYS been done in the RTA Representative forum ...which ISN'T private and isn't unaccountable to the community.<br>
___________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Incorrect, it has been stated numerous times that rotations have been created in private channels and emails, which are private, and are not in the RTA Rep forum.<br>

Apathy? Apathy is the reason why this matter can't be allowed to be voted on in the RTA Representative forum? ...Because, up until now, I've been told that no one agrees with me ...I'm a one man argument. Apathy doesn't represent agreement or disagreement ...they simply don't care.<br>
<br>
And, the simple fact that they do not care enough to post to this thread does not, automatically, lend the idea that you are right and I am wrong ...it simply means, they don't care enough to post here.<br>
___________________________________________________<br>
<br>
I disagree.  You are fighting for a change to the status quo.  By not voting, or not even calling a vote, the RTA Representatives are supporting the status quo.<br>

<br>
Rig stated:<br>
<br>
You are correct in a fashion, I am here for the sake of argument. I am here because I see something that I believe is wrong ...and I am attempting to debate my side of that argument. Give me a solid, logical, rational FACT I can use to explain away all of the elitist bullshit I see happening, the exploitation of powers that certain people do not have, the theft of authority from the RTA Representatives into the hands of 3 people who clearly are not acting in interest to the RTA community. <br>
___________________________________________________<br>
<br>
You are mistaken about what the RTA is and what the RTA does.  The RTA is NOT a governing body.  The RTA admins are mediators and administrators/managers of the forums and rotation calendar.  The RTA Reps are representatives of their guild to the public.  The RTA is just a nice convenient meeting place for people to discuss things and resolve differences.<br>
<br>
Rotations have ALWAYS been established privately by the people who have access to that content.  From my experience in Tindi in dealings with BotS and SoT, most rotations are established by BotS saying &quot;You do this and we'll share the content&quot; and the guild that wants access to the content meeting up to the expectations of BotS.<br>
<br>
You can call this elitist till you are blue in the face, but the fact of the matter is, what can anyone do about it?  From what I've seen, the other guilds on the server don't have problems with rotations that have been in place for years, so what makes you think that the people at the top are doing a bad job of setting up rotations?<br>
___________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Rig stated:<br>
<br>
Call for a simple vote in the RTA forum ...call for it, let it happen ...this ends. Why can't that one SIMPLE thing happen? I know why ...and it has nothing to do with Apathy. <br>
___________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Why is it then?  It seems to me that the RTA Reps in general do not agree with your position, and the one who has agreed with you is fully capable of calling the vote that you want, but he doesn't.  So why not?<br>
<br>
And please don't say it's because of the elitists, because it's not.  They play by the same rules as everyone else.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I'm a bit curious, who was it that set up the Shei rotation?  FK and LoM?  Did you guys do it on the RTA Rep forum?<br>

On one point, and it is the same point Hutterr made.<br>
<br>
As a rep I would like to be able to see the process the EP guilds are going through to make these decisions. <br>
It would be nice to be up to date when ones guild hits that point so you are not rehashing old arguments and discussions that have already been hammered out.<br>
<br>
Now having said that. Given that it seems some reps have no qualms about taking arguments to the flame boards, and these are difficult negotiations, I think EP forum should remain exactly as it is, CLOSED to outside view. I think it is very courteous of these guilds to make the decision to bring this discussion to a forum here, where the discussions will be available for viewing by EP guild reps as they need them.<br>
<br>
So just for general information I got bored at work and I actually went through and looked.<br>
12 guild reps have made their position clear to leave the EP forum as is.<br>
1 sort of suggested it should be readable, in the same way that the rep forum is.<br>
<br>
So it would appear many have weighed in and disagreed with your position that the EP forum should be open to public viewing.<br>
<br>
I for the record for all the reason that have already been posted think it should stay as is. I doubt this will ever be a concern for me, but in the unlikely event it is, I hope it is exactly as it is now. <p>Shariona Seerkin Circle of Virtue<br>

He seems to want it public so we cannot abuse the EP rotations? Or at least he wants to public to police the EP guilds rather than to leave us to our own devices.<br>
<br>
However, fact of the matter is, EP guilds are accountable to NOBODY whatsoever, other than the other 3 elemental guilds, at least while in the elemental planes.<br>
<br>
Example: Tindi decides its going to live in plane of fire, we log in and clear it everytime it spawns for weeks on end...How can anyone NOT in the elemental planes hold us accountable? Drop our non ele rotations off? Why would we care if we have unlimited access to far better loot? Are you going to come into fire and KS our mobs from us for breaking rotations? No, because you don't have access to the zone. Hmm, so you want to have a watchdog in the EP forum for what reason? Sit there and whine that you cannot do anything to us?<br>
<br>
EP forum polices EP guilds, if Tindi were to do what I just said, BotS NB and FK would permakill all the EP's and kick our asses off all rotations, mass chaos and anarchy would ensue. However, Tindi, nor any of the other EP guilds want anarchy as it is not condusive to a fun gaming environment, therefore we try to be mature, and handle ourselves with some amount of courtesy and respect, at least usually.<br>
<br>
So basically there you have it, no candy coating, just eat it and like it, cause you don't have any other choice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigorre>Rigorre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Much ado about nothing</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/9/03 9:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Guild vote</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The set of folks who should be allowed to vote are the reps who already have access to the EP forum. This is because it is their choice whether or not their discussions should be made public.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No.  You cannot take a rotation rule stating that 'only people with access' can vote in matters of the RTA.  NEWSFLASH!  THE RTA ISN'T A ROTATION ...THE EP FORUM ISN'T A ROTATION.  There are NO ROTATIONS of RTA message board content.  There is one, and only one, requirement for access to RTA content ...you have to be a breathing human being smart enough to create an ezboard account and find your way here.  In order to have INPUT in the leadership of the RTA?  ...you must be a guild, or more accurately a representative of a guild, that has at least 40+ level 46+ members.  Once you meet that requirement, you get ONE guild vote in the Representative forum.<br>
<br>
Nor can you invoke the &quot;only people with access should vote&quot; rule to this issue simply because the forum is created for the purpose of forming rotations in the Elem Planes.  The fact that you have always formed rotations in other medium, privately among yourselves, is not a precedence that has to be, or should be, recognized here in the RTA.  Because I can argue the complete opposite and say that ALL DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE OCCURED HERE IN THE RTA CONCERNING ROTATIONS HAVE BEEN DONE PUBLICLY (at least to the point that the RTA Rep forum is viewable by everyone) ...this is a FACT, just like your argument is FACT.  <br>
<br>
Of course, then your herd is going to say &quot;yeah, but the discussions on the RTA have only been to change existing rotations, not form them&quot;.  You separate the two simply because it fits your agenda to do so ...and there simply is no logical separation between DISCUSSIONS TO CHANGE ROTATIONS and DISCUSSIONS TO FORM ROTATIONS ...none, zero logic.  The exact same arguments you are using to keep your circle jerk forum private by claiming &quot;right to privacy to form rotations&quot; are null and void considering the same arguments can be used to support a &quot;right to privacy to change rotations&quot; ...and someone, at some point, has determined that no such right to privacy exists as long as those discussions occur here in the RTA.  <br>
<br>
It results in an inconsistent policy.  <br>
<br>
Existance of and access to RTA content (any forum = RTA content) has to be decided by the leadership of the RTA ...the Guild Representatives that make up the RTA ...not you ...not the RTA Admin.<br>
<br>

I don't care if the subject of that forum was sharing Betty-fargin-Crocker recipes ...seriously, I don't care.<br>
<br>
If I wanted a private forum on the RTA so that I can talk about how big my juevos are, I would EXPECT to have to take that matter to MY Guild RTA Representative, ask for their support of my private forum, who would then take my request to the other RTA Representatives for approval because my Guild Rep does not have the authority to create a private forum on his own (as opposed to maybe having your own little pocket admin or two), then based on that approval, the RTA Admins would create the forum and give all of my equally big juevo friends access.<br>
<br>
I would never take my request to Roggulbuk and expect him to simply create my private little forum ...unlike the EP forum which was taken directly to the 1 or 2 of the RTA Admin group ...who failed to act objectively and impartially because, surprise!, they are part of the EP community ...and in one fail swoop, it was created -BLAM-, a law was created to cover it's purpose -BLAM-, and all sorts of people were given access -BLAM-.  NOTHING was ask of or taken to the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>leaders of this community</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
The 'entire crux of my problem' as you put it, is the idea that you do not get to come here and thumb your elitist nose up to the rest of the community.  You are not above the law here, the same law that applies to everyone applies to you ...and everyone else would have had to ask the RTA Representatives to get a private forum.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The main problem here is Rigorre seems to think the RTA is empowered with much more than it is.

Who do you think you are fooling?<br>
<br>
You are right.  I do have a misconception of the RTA ...the one that says there is no room for TWO communities on the RTA ...yours and ours ...us and them ...the haves and the have-nots. This is the situation YOU have provided by creating a separate and private forum within RTA walls, but outside RTA jurisdiction.  ...and yet, even given my utter disagreement with it, I am willing to let the RTA Representatives decide if there is, in fact, room for two communities ...a decision they should have had in the very first place.<br>

True, this is a fact that you can hold on to, in game.  Unfortunately, the Elemental Planes does not exist here on the RTA ...and, while you are here, you are accountable to the other guilds making up the RTA community, or more accurately, the representatives of those guilds ...the RTA Representatives.  They are your 'peers' here in the RTA because the one thing that separates 'you' from 'us' in-game (the Elem Planes) DOES NOT EXIST HERE.

<br>
actually existance and access to any rta content on this board is finally decided by the owner of the board.  If he or people with his permission wanted to change it to anything they wanted, you have the choice of either accepting it, or taking the rotations to a new forum agreeable by the community.  So far most seem reasonably happy with this forum and the head of this board has not countered the addition of the forum.  Or the addition of the books forum which i dont recall seeing a vote on, or other forums added.  They were just added to try to meet a need.   <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.sport.rr.com/rainessa/rainsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Ok I think I understand. Riggorre is objecting to the Admins creating the forum in the first place without a formal vote by the reps.<br>
<br>
Ok on that I absolutely disagree, the admins are fully within their duties to create a forum for use by EP guilds and to make it private to those needs.<br>
<br>
This is a basic disagreement over what constitutes the duties and responsibilities of the admins.<br>
<br>
I checked absolutely no where do we have a job description for the admins. Now ....the question would be do we need one?<br>
<br>
NO<br>
<br>
The admins have certain abilities granted them by the owner of the message board and Ezboard.<br>
They can create and disband forums.<br>
They can move, delete, lock and edit messages.<br>
They can create security on individual forums.<br>
<br>
The reps voted on new admins and have called for and voted on removal of admins. But once the admins have the job, they do the above.<br>
<br>
No where ...I repeat &quot;no where&quot; in any agreement, rule or other does it imply that a vote is required by the reps for the admins to do their jobs.<br>
<br>
Clearly Riggorre thinks this rule should exist. In fact it would appear he is arguing that it does exist. <p>RTA Rep Shariona  55 Cleric  Circle of Virtue<br>

<br>
This statement is actually incorrect.  There have been in the past forums relating to rotations that were password protected.  Shortly after the SoT and NB joined the Trakanon rotation, a thread was started in the Admin forum to track who was up for that rotation.  After a time, this thread was moved to a new forum call &quot;Trakanon Rotation forum&quot;.  With the only people having access to that forum being the Guild Reps from the Trakanon rotation guilds.  Eventaully I got sick of updating the damn thread and programmed the now used Rotation system, and since the need for that forum was now gone it was deleted.<br>
<br>
So there you go.  You are wrong.  Administrators of the RTA not only have the &quot;rights&quot; to create new forums, it is in fact a defining role of thier job. <p>&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;&amp;lt;A HREF=&amp;quot;http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus&amp;quot; TARGET=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;IMG SRC=&amp;quot;http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg&amp;quot; HEIGHT=&amp;quot;150&amp;quot; WIDTH=&amp;quot;400&amp;quot; ALT=&amp;quot;Milambus Mandragon&amp;quot; BORDER=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/A&amp;gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rigorre>Rigorre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Much ado about nothing</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/10/03 7:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Guild vote</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ok I think I understand.

No choice is made without either email/tell or posting in the admin section.

<br>
Simple majority rules. Sometimes choices are made without ALL the admins but always with atleast 3 (2/3 of current admins) and I have yet seen an admin make a choice and not have all the other admins agree. We are fair and level headed, you may see some of the brighter colors of us when we get attacked but who wouldnt in those situations.<br>
<br>
Trust me when I say there is nothing to be gained by being an admin other then helping keep and established well intentioned idea alive.<br>
<br>
I really hope this clears it up to the people nominated and for the people who think this is some kind of power. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What do admins do you ask?<br>
Well for one if every admin was from the same guild it would mean nothing for the fact remains nothing is decided by them except for sanctunes, Wich at this point is 1 month and any remaining posting days first offense 2nd is 2 months, we havent gone further because no on has gotten to the second level.<br>
Admins job here is a headache, they try to streamline the posts for change to the calendar, they summorize the info much like you would summurize a book.<br>
They announce punishment that ALL admins vote on. <br>
Usualy its pretty cut and dry weather a guild deserves a break or not (so far no one has been given a break) the only reason there is a vote so as to ensure that the choices made are not biased in any way. <br>
There is no POWER in being a admin, so get that thought out of your head. All it is , is someone volunteering there time to deal with YOU (and trust me dealing with YOU is a pain sometimes)<br>
As far as Thun and me go we will still be here and out votes will count but our main purpose is to take care of the actual Board and web pages, and the overall calendar mainanence, and offer our experience to the new admins who get to look evil like I seem to have my last few days :&gt; <br>
If you still feel absolute that we cant have 2 MFH then call a vote and see what the community wants.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Maintenance of the forums by GIVING access rights to forums and the calendar ...GIVING by pushing the right buttons ...not GRANTING by deciding who gets access to what.  And, they are the Judicial arm of the forum ...they are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>supposed to be</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the only true fair and impartial group we have on the RTA, with the ability to decide on and distribute punishment for guilds who have broken an RTA law, because their loyalty / allegiance is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>supposed to be</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to the RTA community first.<br>
<br>
Let me try and point out the important parts because I'm sure all the words are confusing you:<br>
<br>
&quot;NO REAL POWER&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NOTHING IS DECIDED BY THEM EXCEPT SANCTIONS&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;THERE IS NOTHING WE DO BESIDES<br>
1.  GIVE NEW ACCESS TO THE CALENDAR (maintenance)<br>
2.  ANSWER QUESTIONS<br>
3.  GET YELLED AT<br>
4.  GET PERSONAL ATTACKS (RARE)<br>
5.  REARRANGE CALENDAR DATES (maintenance)<br>
6.  [IMPOSE] THE RARE SANCTION AGAINST A GUILD (judiciary)&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;THERE IS NO POWER IN BEING AN ADMIN&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;THEY ANNOUNCE PUNISHMENT THAT ALL ADMINS VOTE ON&quot;<br>
<br>
...and the most important of all ...<br>
<br>
&quot;If you still feel absolute that we cant have 2 MFH then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>call a vote and see what the community wants</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Admins ...Nyca, Milambus, and Emil (because I happen to know for a FACT that Roggulbuk had absolutely no knowledge of this private forum before it's creation ...funny ho ho or funny ha ha?) ...had no authority to create a PRIVATE forum outside the jurisdiction of the RTA.  Period.<br>
<br>
You can't read what Vincecross said and &quot;perceive&quot; there is any authority to do so ...because it is simply not there.  NO POWER = NO AUTHORITY.  Making that leap of judgement is like saying the RTA Admins have the authority to 'grant' access to the RTA Rep forum or even the calendar without first having a guild with 40 level 46+ members.  They GIVE access, they don't GRANT access.  How hard is that to understand?<br>
