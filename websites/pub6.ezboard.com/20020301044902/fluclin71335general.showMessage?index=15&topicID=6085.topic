Everything else I hated. <p><p>

I hate how you don't need 50+ friends to help you do quests.  What's the point of questing for something if you don't get to drag your entire guild and all your friends along? <br>
<br>
I hate how you can solo pretty much forever.  WTF is up with that, making almost every class self-reliant to some extent.<br>
<br>
I hate having chat channels that you can invite people to. How dare they allow communication between multiple guilds on raids!<br>
<br>
I hate tradeskills where the stuff you make is better than the storebought stuff! How dare they give the players an actual viable/worthwhile economy!<br>
<br>
Ok. Enough sarcasm.<br>
<br>
What I really do honestly hate tho, is the lack of new content, the comparatively small geographical size of the realms, and lack of teleporting.  Running from Connla to Druim Ligen in Hibernia (about the equivalent of running from Freeport to Rivervale) takes about 20min if yer not a bard with speedyfeet. Finally, I hate the fact that using items that increase your skill over your level (ie, having a 36blunt at level 31) doesn't give you any of the benefits of having a 36 blunt skill.<br>

I'll try to keep it short so peeps will actually read it.  I jumped the EQ ship when Camelot came out (but never fully cancelled my account).  <br>
<br>
Things I like:<br>
<br>
I still like Camelot very much there are aspects of it that are a huge improvement over EQ.  <br>
1) Quests: I find myself more interested in Camelot quests because I don't have to sit there for 5 minutes typing things like &quot;What muffins&quot; &quot;I will deliver the muffins&quot; &quot;Can I have the muffins&quot; &quot;Give me the muffins&quot; &quot;Argh just forget it! Go shove those muffins up your !@#@#$&quot;  I like questing in these games and while I think EQ has more quests I think DaoC covers the item questing better.  In 3 levels I had completely upgraded my entire wardrobe.  And while you can do this in EQ most classes can't do it until they come of Kunark age (for the non-iksar classes) but in Camelot you can quest for gear at almost any level as well as winning it on a drop or crafting it. (I'll get to crafting later)  <br>
<br>
2) Camraderie: I've found that given the factional system (Hibs, Albs, and Mids) that people are more cooperative with each other.  I think this stems from a couple diff angles.  One If more than one person kills something the Exp is shared  grouped or not.  This is nice for healers who like to do run by healings (coming from an EQ cleric heritage I really liked this feature).  But overall I have found folks to be much more helpful. (although I have to say I think this may just have to do with the server I play on (percival).  But people have just randomly given me stuff and I also have done this as well (although I also do this in EQ so &lt;shrug&gt;)<br>
<br>
3) Dungeons: The dungeons in DC seem more dungeon-y to me.  Now granted I haven't seen all the dungeons in EQ (and there are some I absolutly love there) but I get more of a deep dark dank dungeon-y feel from them. (again this is my Op. only here I'm sure there are some that disagree)<br>
<br>
4) CS and Development:  I've had numerous run ins with Cs over there and while I wouldn't say this is a top over EQ (because I've had good exp with EQ CS as well) I would say that I've found them to be extremly nice and helpful and very forthcoming about their depts. shortcomings and efforts to improve the system.  Their Dev team has seemed to me for the most part to collect ideas and implement the ones that seem nice. (with the understanding that not everyone's ideas can go into the game and not everyone's ideas mesh with what they're trying to accomplish.  Oh and try this in EQ: The patch they applied to day had a crash bug in it so they had to take the servers down twice after the patch so what they did was give everybody free exp. (not alot but noticable) after logging in after the patch.  (I cannot ever see VI EVER doing this, but I'd love for them to prove me wrong)<br>
<br>
5) Graphics:  A friend of mine who's a fellow EQ addict came over and made the comment that Luclin graphics bring it pretty much up to par with DC but I tend to disagree.  Midgard reminds me of Upstate new york in winter.  Lots of snow and gray skies.  (one of the reasons I like Mid)  Hib makes me think of the green rolling hills of Ireland (although some don't like it, I know) and Alb. well I haven't spent alot of time there (I just can't get into that realm)<br>
<br>
6) RvR: This is argumentative because some will say it's easy to get burned out on this.  I have yet to have that happen.  I love RvR and think that people also get the wrong perception of it.  So many go well there are purples out there that kick my butt so I'm not going out till I can hold my own against the highest person on the field.  I personally have been RvR'ing since my second or third month in the game and I love it.  I've helped on keep raids, defense and just all out brawls.  My guild loves for me to come out there even though I'm of limited use we all have fun and I realize that if I die and they can't get to rez me then so be it.  I've become very good at dodging the bullet (arrow/spell) and RvR'ing smartly and I think that when the time comes and I am 40+ I'm going to be dangerous out on the field (maybe, hehe)<br>
<br>
7) Potential:  There's alot being promised right now and I have to say if they deliver on it I'm going to be very happy.  Guild banks, housing, horses, RP rewards, More content (supposedly some more epic mobs and new zones coming in a month or two), guild controllable forts (you have to play to understand this one), and (in the next expansion) a new graphics engine.  All of these have me really excited to see what's coming for Camelot in the future.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Patch time: And this is minor really.  Av. EQ patch time: 7 or more hours.  Average DC patch time: 1hr.  Is wonderful when I'm home and they decide it's patch day.<br>
<br>
Ok now in order to be fair though here's my assessment of what could improve:<br>
<br>
1) Holes:  There are some definate zones that need more work.  Camelot and Spin are two of the places that need some masonry work big time.  I'm still hearing about folks dropping through holes into the big black nothing.  This is something that should be a gimme for fixing quickly.  To be fair though they have put a big priority on game breaking holes (ie ones that lead out of frontiers and into newbie areas).<br>
<br>
2) Communication:  Their original outlet for communication was to use camelotvault.ign.com.  However they've slowly withdrawn from that and I agree they should have.  It is a seething board of uselessness and hate right now (not entirely but for the most part).  I do think that they should offer some communication to the players on a daily basis to do nothing more than show &quot;Hey we're here and we're listening&quot;.  But to be fair they have done this in the past I think though that a daily update of stuff we're working on today would be neat.  Something like &quot;Hey we're working on a new mob today, can't garantee it'll be done by 5pm but we'll work on it again either tomarrow or sometime soon.  Hoping to get it in by patch after next&quot;.  This won't appeal to everyone but it would be kinda neat.<br>
<br>
3) Crafting: I like DC crafing over EQ crafting but there's still something missing.  It has a better feel than EQ but I just can't get into it for some reason.  I like that you can actually MAKE MONEY off it though. (I SO wish EQ would take a page outta that book on this)<br>
<br>
4) Camraderie: Similar category as above but with different twist.  I haven't been able to forge deep rooted friendships like in EQ on this.  Maybe it's just me but I don't have that I would go to PoF and back for you kind of feeling for anybody in this game.  As such I feel a little detachted even though I joined up with a SZ transfer guild over there.  Not sure why and have been seeing if I could gain that feeling but so far no good.<br>
<br>
5) Fighting and Healing: A few above made the comment that combat seemed too drawn out but I have to say that having played a regrowth specced bard (healer type) that I felt combat went too fast.  Often I found that I couldn't seem to get to one person or another in combat fast enough to keep them healed.  Maybe it's just I don't have the twitch reflexes or something.  Also I've seen and it's been complained about alot that Healing in RvR is useless as people die to quick.  Well what's the point of playing a healer in RvR then?<br>
<br>
6) RvR: Like Eq's earlier days there's still some balance to work out between the classes.  Now I'm not talking like balance they talk about on the boards (stupid things like my caster should have the HP's of a tank or anyting) but there's some (to me) obvious spells missing in the game. (cancel magic comes to mind REAL quick, levitate would be a neat spell too)<br>
<br>
I'm sure there's more but this post is already way too long.  Hope this helps and really overall I find I like this game and where it's headed.  I would recomend trying it in about 6 months to just about anybody. <p><SELECT>

<br>
Sure would be great to actually get an extra combat ability from that +5 slash weapon you get. But just think about it. These items drop all the time, in a somewhat common fashion. <br>
<br>
The twinking system that downgrades armor for someone that is trying to twink only works for spell modification, Armor class, and weapon damage.<br>
<br>
Take a ring I have (cant remember name offhand but it is +4 to slash skill)<br>
<br>
I can put this Purple+++ ring on a level 5 fighter that put all his points in slash. He could effectivly be fighting dmg wise at the same level someone 4 levels higher then him.<br>

This is why they do not allow combat styles to be applied when skill is raised via an item.<br>
<br>
level 5 mele with the 3rd combat styles is just a bit much. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.cyou.com/CyberSolutions/X/sig.jpg">

<br>
It's not the styles really, I'd just like to see some kind of benefit, be it a small bonus to hit/damage, or small reduction in delay.  And i'm mostly talking about weapons.  Sure, you can equip a purple weapon, but chances are the penalties you take for using a weapon so far more advanced than you are going to cancel out any possible bonuses for the extra ranks in the skill.  <br>
