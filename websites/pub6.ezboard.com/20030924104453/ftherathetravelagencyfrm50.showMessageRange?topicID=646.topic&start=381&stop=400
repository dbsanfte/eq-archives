<br>
Yep..That's why I didn't say impossible - I said improbable.  Nowhere do I say impossible.  Impossible =/ Improbable.  Please read better.<br>
<br>
And if we are making Rathe Rules off of what a FFA server does; we have issues.  I hold our &quot;Ratheians&quot; to a higher standard then FFA server peeps.  The rotations help to do this, but in the end - Honor lies solely within the individual and guild, not through the Rotation system.  I don't think that applies here.<br>

Do you draw the line at MM, or Bertox? Do you draw the line at only the mobs with alternate quest routes that you can bypass them? Or do you just make a stand alone rule that all boss encounters are the same, rotation or non rotation, and teaming is not allowed period, unless an official alliance is made.<br>
<br>
Most seem to agree that the line should either be drawn at Grummus, Behe, and AD, or that all mobs should be uniformly adheard to same as normal rotation mobs. So which side does everyone stand on? How do you count up the 'votes'? Does Noble Blade get the same weight on the vote as Baby Spiders or United Necro's? Obviously if you vote, somebody will win, and somebody will lose. The losers will be mad regardless of who they are, either the HoH flagged, or the wanting to be HoH flagged.<br>
<br>
Therefore it seems a COMPROMISE is in order. Each side gives in a little. So, what are the Pro teamers willing to give up, and what are the Anti teamers willing to give up? If neither are willing to give up anything we will have an impass, then voting will be required...round and round we go.<br>
<br>
So, offer up what solutions we can abide by, or sit and wait till the decisions get made for everyone by lack of action. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=o8ithefitzi8o>O8I The Fitz I8O</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/18/03 3:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=384>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> Milambus,<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The same could be said of the rotation system in its entirety(sp). Just because the more progressed guilds have a system set up amongst themselves to share the killing of specific mobs in a rotational order does not mean that other guils on the RTA have to follow that system.<br>
<br>
But yet the rotation system does work, and most of the guilds on the server work within this system. So why does it work? Because everyone knows that by respecting another guilds rotations, thier own rotations will be respected. NB knows that because they respect the rotations that BotS is on, BotS will then respect our rotations.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, the RTA rotation system on rotation mobs work.  I have no dispute over this topic.  In fact, I applaud how well it has worked so far.  How rotations work are clearly defined in a set of rules on the RTA message board.  The RTA does a good job a managing the rotations.<br>
<br>
Guilds that particpate in the RTA rotation system must abide by the stated RTA rules.  They are not allowed to come up with their own systems for the different rotation mobs.<br>
<br>
FCFS mobs are compeletly different however, they are not managed by the RTA.  There are no rules defined on the RTA message board on how to share FCFS mobs.   How the mob is shared is left to the guilds that are participating in killing a particular mob.  In most cases, the general rule of thumb for FCFS mobs is: &quot;kill it however and whenever you want, no one cares.&quot;<br>
<br>
Guilds do not have to follow the already estabilished FCFS rules that may have already been sit up by others that are participating in sharing a FCFS mob.  They can set up a new system.  If a conflict arises they can't go to the RTA, they must go to Verant and contact a GM becuase Verant is the <br>
highest level of authority on FCFS mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milambus>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 927<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/18/03 3:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=385>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/profile/fist1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do understand the thought process about the abuse of continual teaming to speed through PoP.

Not a very convincing argument.  &quot;I don't really care what you think anyway!&quot;<br>

Do you really want to go down this street?  Because you know what I don't play EQ to make you happy and content either, but there sure are alot of things that I do do that enable you to be much happier than if I didn't.<br>

Maybe I'm simply unaware of it, but I have not heard of any &quot;massive strife&quot; within CB or VolS between those that got thier flags and those that did not.<br>

As for the loot.. isnt the whole argument been that you are not killing them for the loots?  Why should it matter who gets it then.  72 flags, which is the most important loot off these mobs, is very easy to split.<br>
<br>
I don't deny that it would be hard, I also don't deny that people would be able to work around those difficulties.<br>

If this discussion were not happening right now, how many more times do you think AD would have been teamed up against already?  I know of at least one guild that is waiting for this discussion to come to a conclusion before allowing thier members to do so again.<br>
<br>
And as someone kept saying above, aparently RC, DS, and Vind are teamed up against as a common practice, so why wouldn't AD?  AD has far superior loot, just considering the flags. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sandalorn>Sandalorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I am the Highway!</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/18/03 3:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=386>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> Gradduk,<br>
<br>
I have enjoyed reading your replies and I understand your argument.  <br>
<br>
Where to draw the line??  Or do we even draw it at all??  That is the rub indeed.<br>
<br>
I would like to see AD, Behem, &amp; Grummus at least be open to teaming if needed.  I still don't think you will see alot of teaming happening.  I just don't think it applies that well to a mid-tier guild that it working to progress on it's own.  Teaming doesn't really fall into that equation.  But I still would like the opportunity to do so if the perfect teaming situation arrives.  So that if higher level people (which I am not btw - I am not fighting this battle for myself but for my guild's higher level people that I feel shouldn't have to wait for their entire guild to catch up level/gear-wise to have the opportunity to xp in a new zone) in Mid-Tier guilds that want to xp in these zones do have an outlet to do so without having to wait for their entire guild to catch up to them to then try it as a guild.  To me, this situation is about individual rights, not guild rights.<br>
<br>
Thats my whole spiel.  Take it or leave it as you will. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

No, you are incorrect.  The guilds that are on a rotation make up the rules for that rotation.  The RTA is just a message board that houses those rules so all can view them.<br>
<br>
The Cursed rotation has different rules than the NToV rotation, which has different rules than the Trakanon rotation.  These rules are made and agreed to by the guilds on the rotation, then they are given to the RTA admins to post here.<br>

You are incorrect actually.  The mobs within Hate, Fear and Sky are both FCFS on some days, and have rules that are overseen by the RTA.  However, even ignoring this, I will agree that mobs outside those 3 planes that are FCFS currently have no rules.<br>
<br>
Yet, the point you seem to be missing is, just because a rule does not exist today, does not mean it can not be placed into effect tomarrow.  A year ago there wasn't any rules about the Cursed rotation either, but they exist now.<br>

You are correct, no one can force another to follow any player made rule.  However, not following player made rules generally leads to a less happy server in general. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lukieb2>Lukieb2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member User</span><br>  Posts: 669<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/18/03 4:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=388>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> Mass paranoia, still.

What is stopping VoF/LoM teaming up to do it? I would have to say probably their reputation since reputation has almost everything to do with whether or not you succeed on the Rathe.  This would have to be said for any other guild on the Rathe.  Where some might have broken some rules or screwed up on minor things, they will not, I repeat, NOT, break rules such as our Rotation.  Doing so would bring mass hatred towards any toon in that guild and thus would ruin their EQ careers.  Don't act as though this is an issue to do with something that is going to happening in the near future due to teaming; it's an issue about Paranoid fucks.  <br>

Oh..I'm sorry..I didn't know we played on a different server.  I thought this was the Rathe..That was what I was talking about.  Why would I give a flying leap on how another servers deal with its issues?<br>
<br>
So now we are going to start making rules on the Rathe based on what happens with other servers.  This must be a new policy.<br>
<br>
The reason FFA servers have to zerg with those numbers is because they are always fighting to race to the mobs or to have superior numbers to be able to get the kill.  They have had this mentality from day 1 because that is how things there Servers operate.  I thought we on the Rathe did things different.<br>
<br>
I am honestly insulted that you all think that just because AD, Behe, and Grummus are made &quot;teamable&quot; that this is going to cause our server to mirror what a FFA server does.  We have grown up with the Rotation system and we all must believe in it or as Zahrim (or whatever) says &quot;We would have /Movelogged&quot;.  I think you do all the Mid-Tiered level people a disservice by thinking we would just start &quot;Team-Zerging&quot; everything.  That's a bummer that you think that.<br>

I, however, have another opinion.  I believe the reason that more people are reasonable on the Rathe is directly related to the fact that we have the Rotation system.  I don't believe that the people of the Rathe are some how more reasonable people than on other servers.<br>

I understand that and agree.  But just because something happens on a FFA server is not a good reason to make a rule on our server IMO.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I think the problem may be a fundamental difference of opinion. We all agree that the Rathe is different from most other servers. However, you seem to think the reason the Rathe is different is because some how all the more reasonable people ended up on our server and because of this a rotation system occured.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I can see how this would seem to be my opinion from prior statements from me.  There is a small difference though in my actual vs. perceived opinion.  I don't think that the Rathe has all the reasonable people on it.  That's absurd to believe that.  I DO feel that people that have played on our server to the point where they are in a guild in the position to even try to team up on RZ, etc. have seen that their guilds and their toons reputations means ALOT on this server and most are very apprehensive about tarnishing it.  I don't think you will see members of guilds wanting to alienate their entire guild and to tarnish its reputation to team-zerg a flag mob.  I might be wrong.  Maybe it will all turn to chaos.  But I think that guild reputations would prevent that kind of slip into FFA chaos.<br>
<br>
<br>
How about this proposal.<br>
<br>
1.  AD, Grum, Behe are left as non-Rot mobs.  Teaming is allowed if necessary.  Guilds are let known that the &quot;Rathe&quot; would like these mobs to be killed by a single guild, but know that is not always feasible to mid-tier guilds as they usually have a wide level range and sometimes will not have enough required higher levels to kill these mobs.  This way high level toons of a mid-tiered guild can still get flagged without having to wait for their guild to all reach their level.  That means individually these high level toons can progress accordingly.<br>
<br>
2. All other PoP boss mobs are recognized to be regular rotation mobs as defined by the guilds that have killed them.<br>
<br>
Just an idea.<br>

Firstly, we have shades of grey that people are suggesting *should* be against the rules. As you will notice, and I will add, there is no written rule that covers this. <br>
<br>
Continuing to ask to see things in absolute terms such as a 'line in the sand' won't serve the argument for teaming, by the way. Because in absolute terms, it can be proven that the three mobs in question are not substantially differant than any other that is on a rotation, and that isn't what will win you the argument. <br>
<br>
You will not sidetrack me into a discussion about spawn times and loot considerations, and direct versus indirect progression, even though I am not often one to avoid long posts, and rather enjoy them at some level. Your examples above range from the absurd to the semi-serious, and that's fine, being that you know very well why a moss snake isn't in the running, and you also, having read this discussion, know that rumble crush was once very close to being on a rotation himself. <br>

Rogg, what points changed your mind suddenly, please enlighten us so that maybe we may see the same light. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
While I doubt you will agree with my thought process, and accept that, I'll try to explain anyway. (And if you mean 'tell us what you think', that's fine. But if you use 'enlighten' as a jab with some pseudo-superior connotation, let me make sure I rise to the challenge; eat me. Take whichever of my replies fits how you meant me to interpret the wording of your post- in other words, don't be offended if you were not trying to offend)<br>
<br>
Here's my thought process. <br>
<br>
1. The mobs in question are beneficial to those who kill them. <br>
2. The mobs in question are relatively long respawns<br>
3. The mobs in question are desired content, proven by the fact that people want to kill them<br>
<br>
Therefore; each mob in question fits all the criteria for a rotation, to the letter. No argument can change that, so we'll take it as a fact. <br>
<br>
The only distinction, and one I've already made, is that after these mobs are killed just a few times, they provide the benefit to the guild that killed them. No argument can change that, so we'll take it as a fact, as well. <br>
<br>
That means that putting them on a formal rotation, would result in a list of guilds who are on autopass; there is no need to put him on a rotation if the rotation will soon be empty again. That isn't so much a fact, as it is a bit of logical development, but, eh, whatever. <br>
<br>
That does not mean, however, that the mob is unwanted; the desire to kill the mob does *not* have to come only from a guild able to kill him. I want to kill the AoW, and will soon, but I still have desire for the mob. <br>
<br>
This is where my thinking started to bend, a little. Desire is proved, if nothing else, by the replies to this thread and the want to team up on the mob. Desire is obviously present, so no amount of argument will change that either; therefore, it is a fact that desire is present. <br>
<br>
However, if there are instantly any number of entities that have the ability to kill the mobs by teaming, as there would be if a teaming rule was applied, then a rotation would be a necessary component as people tried to get their tries in at him. It may be a bit round-about, but it is nonetheless true that if many groups or single guilds can kill this mob, that many groups or single guilds will want to kill this mob now that they are suddenly able to. <br>
<br>
If many guilds or groups are able to kill the mob, he will become contested for a fairly long time. If you'll note, I left the word &quot;contested&quot; out of the requirements for a rotation, above. Here it is now: While it may be true that AD is not *currently* a contested mob, if you added a large number of guilds to the pool of guilds that can kill him, and in that large number of guilds, had people for whom AD's loot table would include some *major* upgrades, then killing him 'just for flags' would become less the primary reason, and more an equal reason, to kill him. <br>
<br>
Long respawns, valuable loot, contested mob... ding ding ding we have a rotation. The *only* reason that this mob would remain off a rotation, is that people would realize that by asking for one, they ruin it for themselves. Just as I said that a rotation should not be asked for with the intent to cockblock, a rotation should not be avoided for the purposes of twisting the rules to one's own benefit, because if a rotation was necessary, than by definition, anyone who wanted on in an unofficial team, would be breaking the rules of the RTA. This is not a case of a couple of guilds; there are many numbers of permutations that could arise and go in for a kill. <br>
<br>
Here's some basic figuring; I would guesstimate that any two King Tormax guilds would have the punch to kill AD. So lets list the KT guilds for a model. I then took off any guild that has killed AD already alone. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>

<br>
If they are an alliance, well, damn, that makes the conversation very short, doesn't it? <br>
<br>
As has been spouted many times before, you can't be an alliance for one thing, and then not for others. And don't scream &quot;but that's for rotations&quot; at me. It took me quite a while to understand why people were telling me that saying &quot;but they aren't on rotations&quot; was splitting hairs, and adhereing ONLY to the letter of the rules, and not the spirit by which they were created. I'll explain that too, but for now, back to the example. <br>
<br>
If they arn't alliances, well, I'll just pick who they team with. <br>
<br>
VoLS ED <br>
VoF  SoY<br>
CB  FS <br>
LoL SotE<br>
<br>
Ok, looks good, you have 4 new groups able to kill AD. No problem, that's only 9ish groups of people that want to kill him. That's not *too* conjested since he'll spawn 2 times a week, ish. You *might* need a rotation, but probably not at this point, so there's no rules being broken, by the letter of anything, great, off we go. <br>
<br>
But when you figure there are 27 combinations of any two guilds out of that short list of eight (and there are, don't make me do the diagram for it please), barring the ones that just wouldn't want to work together, I'd put a conservative estimate at say, 20 combinations that are workable to kill AD. <br>
<br>
Now, take those 20 combinations and add in the five guilds that kill him now, and you find you have 25 instances of a guild or two guilds that are able to kill him. Three day spawn, with 25 entities that could kill him? You know what that's called? <br>
<br>
It's called the Sev rotation. <br>
<br>
How conjested is that? And how possible do you think it would be to run it without a rotation on it?<br>
<br>
But wait Rogg, because the guilds would have to actually want to kill him that often, that would mean that guilds would have to be killing him for his loot, right? <br>
<br>
Hmm, you know, you're right Mr. Pre-Ssra, Pre Vex Thal gear'ed guild... what ever would they want to do *that* for? <br>
<br>
But wait Rogg, we can just make them say which one other guild they will always kill AD with, can't we, so there arn't 27 differant combinations and allow people to get in on many many kills?<br>
<br>
Sure can! In fact, that's how we recognize a formal alliance. <br>
<br>
Q. I want to team on the AoW. Why can't I?  <br>
A. He's on a rotation. <br>
<br>
Fair enough, I agree and that works for me. <br>
<br>
I did not understand, at first, that the actual words on a website rotations page do not matter as much as a convention in the game. <br>
<br>
That's why, for example, when I first asked about the situation, and didn't get a concrete answer, and saw no written rules about it, gave the go ahead to the officers in my guild who were going to lead our part of the joint raid. (As a note, keep in mind I don't speak for, or with, any representation from VoLS)<br>
<br>
There is indeed a 'rotation' on AD that currently exists. No, you won't find it on the rotations page, and if that is the only &quot;valid&quot; rotation that some people will recognize at all, I can't help you. But it does exist, if you believe it does or not is irrevelent at this point. <br>
<br>
The rotation does exist and it's very simple; don't kill him twice back to back, and if you're killing him, let members from those guilds who have already killed him alone know if there will be flags afterward so that their own guild doesn't have to raid to flag one person. It has established conventions between guilds, and if, as Gromm points out, that it is<br>

<br>
The situation we are in now, is one in which a mob that fits *every* criteria for a rotation, cannot be put on rotation without cries of cockblocking and 'keeping the little guy down'. Let me say that again: A mob that fits every criteria for a rotation, cannot be put on rotation without cries of cockblocking. <br>
<br>
I would like to restate that I want to team to kill the AoW, and that it's cockblocking if you don't let me. <br>
Can't? <br>
Why not? <br>
He's on a rotation. <br>
<br>
Works for me. <br>
<br>
The people you are arguing against now, and who I was arguing against not long ago at all, want to let people know why mobs have the potential to be on rotation, and if there is that potential, they should be treated that way. <br>
<br>
Sontalak has the potential for a rotation, still. If 2 smaller guilds were killing him so often that my guild couldn't get equal time on him, I'd want him on a rotation, and ask for one, and get one. Then those two smaller guilds would have to leave him alone, or 'formalize' the alliance. Either one works for me. <br>

Ok, here's where I explain it. <br>
<br>
These situations have every criteria of a rotation; they work between the guilds like a rotation, and have their own conventions like a rotation. Everything about them, says rotation. <br>
<br>
Saying that they arn't a rotation because they don't appear on the rotation page, is like saying there are no commercials because they arn't listed in your TV Guide. <br>

Well, if there had been rules against it, grey area rules or not, then yes, I suspect my guild would be punished by whatever means the rules suggested. <br>
<br>
But since there were grey areas, and not rules, the 'violation' you're talking about is not to a rule, but to the spirit of the system. The RTA does not have punishments for 'spirit' of the rules issues. Moreover, since this discussion only recently occured, the actions of my guild at the time, obviously took place with out the information that comes from this discussion. <br>
<br>
Let me say it this way:<br>
<br>
Before I read and considered all the reams of arguments and statements that have come out of this, if you put me in the same situation, I'd make the same decisions, and we'd still have teamed AD. <br>
<br>
If you let me go back and make the decision again, having read all this and spent time, a good deal of time, thinking about it, I would have politely said no to the proposal to team up on AD, and not because of the argument it caused; I don't care about being in an argument as long as I am right. <br>
<br>
It would have been because I wouldn't have been. <br>

<br>
But you sure as hell won't be having a very happy environment, nor will you be creating one for everyone else. <br>
<br>
Every rotation is a system that started between guilds. Even the ones that didn't start with big guilds. Hell, watch me make a rotation right now. <br>

If I wasn't trying to prove a point, I'd have my rotation, right now. That simple; be in a guild that killed Sont, and ask for one.  <br>

And you're right; no one HAS to conform to the conventions, no one HAS to be a part of the system. <br>

<br>
Anyway, yeah, lots of non-rotational content that some guilds consider the &quot;boss&quot; mobs of their ability, some guilds consider &quot;the average day at the office&quot; and some guilds say &quot;does that still spawn?&quot; <br>
<br>
For every guild that says &quot;Ralloz Zek down&quot;, there's a guild that is celebrating their first Gorenaire kill, and it's every bit as big and exciting to them. <br>

<br>
Look, while it might be nice to picture the RTA and rotations springing into place as we all hold hands and sway in a circle of love, that's not the driving force here. This is an old server, with old guilds. The rotations and reservations make it possible for this old server to manage the number of people it has at the 'high' and 'middle' parts of the game. <br>
<br>
Honor is not the reason we all came together and built something that is a compromise for all, but makes for a more relaxed playing environment. Sure, we may be a server that prefers pure PvE and not PvAnnoyingPlayersvE, and that's great, but we are in this game for ourselves as much as any other server's people. <br>
<br>
We're just people; and people, when you tell them that they can do whatever they want, will do...whatever they want. <br>
<br>
Just because we have a stable(r) government for our society, does not mean that the people in it are anything but human beings. <br>

Be careful thinking that 'we're just better'. <br>

We're differant, but we could have been exactly the same. <br>

<br>
the reason we use rotations is to avoid heartburn, and ensure a guaranted access to *all* mobs that you 1) want to kill 2) are able to kill.<br>
<br>
rotation mobs, pre pop (except emp) offer such a meager reward per kill, that declaring a rotation for them is a necessity, because to reap the full reward from them, you must kill them 20,30+ times, to outfit your members.<br>
<br>
the tables have been turned in pop:  the rewards from a flag mob are near instantaneous.  That is, you can kill a flag mob 2, or perhaps 3 times and you have obtained the rewards from them and are able to move on.  This is fundamentally why flag mobs are not on rotation; however, the mobs themselves (as rogg explained) are identical to rotational mobs.<br>
<br>
If a provision for compromise would be made, that is: to allow teaming of flag mobs -- i would seek some sort of penalty / payment for teaming.  Much like the written rules of today that state: if you kill a rot mob with a team, your team becomes a single entity -- I feel this needs to be incorporated into the flag mobs.<br>
<br>
This is not a punishment, or a means 'to keep the man down' this is an exhange:  If you want to advance by using methods outside your current resources (your guild), then you must recieve some penalty for it.  This does not disallow teaming, nor does it encourage it - but it offers it up as a posibility in our system.<br>
<br>
I would propose (informally) that teaming up on a pop flag mob would merge the 2 (or more) teams into a single RTA recognized entity for (insert voted on time duration) amount of time, per killing of a flag mob, regarding AD, Behe, Grum.<br>
<br>
*example: (pretend the voted penalty was 2 months per flag mob defeat) If CB and VoLS merged to kill AD 2x, they would be considered an alliance for 4 months, combining forces on any and all rotational mobs they have access to.<br>
<br>
This of course, does not address the issue of temptation of moving forward, with the more advanced pop progressional flag mobs, but it is a start, regarding the compromise everyone is looking for.<br>
<br>
RTA is not designed to piss in anyone cereal, it's designed to be fair, for all.  But it's no more fair to allow 'pick and choose' alliances, while living under the protection of the RTA for all other rot mobs, than it is to deny anyone content with no options whatsoever.<br>
<br>
I am open to debate, on allowing for teaming -- however i fully believe there must be a penalty in some form when it is used - if the team is meant to be a temporary measure to advance.<br>
<br>
(i also, do not believe in grandfathering penalties, to break a spirit of the rule is not the same as breaking a rule -- i would not vote to penalize those who have teamed thus far) <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/view.php?Emil" target="top">Emil Sinclair</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, 65th Monk<br>
