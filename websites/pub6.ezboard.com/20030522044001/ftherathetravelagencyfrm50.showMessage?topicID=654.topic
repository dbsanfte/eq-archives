It has been suggested many times that that guilds who do not have the skill, or the equipment/levels to advance into new content should keep struggling with the old content until they can.  Teaming up is a way to circumvent this limitation.  Two small guilds could unite, skip sshra and VT and go right into PoP.  The idea is that the loot from tradeskill and directly from the mobs would be comparable to sshra/VT and easier to optain in pop, thus creating a faster progression , without compriming their current rotations on Velious and luclin mobs.  This puts guilds that are single entities at a distinct disadvantage because  the small guild get a shot each at a mob, while the larger guild has to wait the full length of the rotation.  <br>
<br>
One of the limiting factors that doesnt get mentioned very often is the number of members in the guild.  There are certainly events (flag or key)  that cannot be accomplished with a small guild regardless of level , skill or strategy.  Lets say that on average a guild has 30 members online everynight, and perhaps up to 40 on the weekends (is this small?).  What do you think is the farthest such a guild could progress in the game without inflating their numbers further?  <br>
Answering this question I believe will be crucial in making a decision about PoP mobs and rotations.  No longer is it a question of equip/skill/level but now a matter of pure numbers.  Can a small guild get that far or would they need to form an alliance to go further?  <br>

<br>
go look at what a guild like Magister accomplished...<br>
<br>
they are a guild that have 45 members or so and they raid with about 40 peeps dayly.. they are in the elemental planes and have done all previous expansions as well with 40 peeps.. no more.<br>
<br>
yes it is possible to  kill stuff in Ssra with 30 peeps.. we have done it as well.. XTC we have done with as low as 35 peeps.<br>
but i would suggest farm the shit out of WToV nameds and try to get in NToV .. that is doable with  30 peeps.<br>
<br>
Telkorenar and Gozzrem in WToV ya can do with 20 peeps if ya know what to do .. try it and see how ya fare.<br>
you really do not need a super big guild to do great things <p>If we are born to Die...... &lt;br&gt;Why fight for Life...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

<br>
Two guilds could team up like that, combine rotations, make their way to the elemental planes to farm armor, and then split their alliances, and gain back all other rotations (except any that they had gotten on as a group for which they are too weak to kill on their own).<br>
<br>
I already feel the blah blah coming about how two guilds combined cannot kill Rallos without VT armor or whatever.  I bet you that assumption is incorrect.  Yes, it will involve zerging, and yes it will involve mass luck.  But a couple of decently large sized ssra farming guilds (post NTOV) could team up and do it with luck and numbers.<br>
<br>
THEN, once they are in the elemental planes, they can farm molds, and in x amount of time, be outfitted in all elemental armor, effectively skipping VT.  I think that skipping VT is on ALOT of people's minds because of the horrible, piece of crap timesinks invovled.<br>
<br>
Also, may I point out that once an alliance gets into the elemental planes and begins to farm elemental armor, it will be wise to split up, because then their individual guild strength will improve to near the level that they will need to do some of the former alliance mobs on their own.<br>
<br>
It is important to understand that no matter what the rules are, or no matter HOW you want to slice the cake, guilds will find a way around things to accomplish whatever they want to.  <br>
<br>
I've had enough of the implied threats too.  Big Guilds can stop staying that &quot;well we can just perma-kill these mobs to keep you from content&quot; AND &quot;well we can just put all these mobs on rotation&quot;.<br>
<br>
Perma-kill mobs for no reason and watch this wonderful system fall apart before your very eyes.  Anarchy will rule the Rathe.<br>
<br>
Put mobs on rotation that don't need to be, and watch my above scenario unfold before your eyes.  Guild will set up temporary alliances to get around issues.<br>
<br>
Just stop being hardasses, and let people play the damn game.  I haven't played EQ for more than a month now because nobody can LET THIS GAME BE A GAME.  Jesus Christ people!<br>
<br>
Too many people take this way too seriously.  I'm trying to decide if I can continue to play a game that I play to have fun, when I have no fun whatsoever because people are constantly being jackasses to one-another. <p><P>

<br>
Keep in mind that those of us in smaller guilds don't play for the mere acquisition of loot (although we do like it, hehe).  Obviously if we were only concerned about that, we would be in higher tiered guilds by now, to accomplish our goals in the game.  It can be said, in fact, that there is a steady flow of people with intentions like you describe passing through our guilds.  They hang with us for a bit, using us to learn the basics of raiding, get their epic and build a little reputation on the server.  Then they detag and get picked up by the higher end guilds.   <p>Gatori Vonhinx<br>

<br>
The reason for that theme in this particular thread is because Sprigg brought up the idea of skipping VT, which would not only be technically possible, but possibly more beneficial in the short run, given the time sinks (assuming a guild ro alliance could actually kill the mobs required to get into elemental planes).<br>
<br>
The prospect of being able to avoid an entire year of farming keys and ores is particularly appealing, and when someone brings it up, the potential is logical to discuss.<br>

Makes for a good argument (and truly, I believe, IS the root of the argument) on keeping people out of your playgrounds.<br>

Make no mistake, this discussion is not about whether or not a guild can get to the elemental planes, it's about HOW they should go about getting there and whether it is within the RTA's sphere of influence to slow them down.<br>

People teamed up on NON ROTATION MOBS.  Why?  Because good players want to see places like HOH... COD..<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with elemtnal armor.. or elemental planes.  We are not trying to skip wtov notv or ssra... HOH is a new place for people to exp.   <br>
<br>
People have lives and cant ALWAYS be on.  AD was not a zerg attempt.. it was planed well by CB and VoLS leadership.  <br>
<br>
As someone else said.. I think it's time to share some of the sand box.   not the whole thing just a portion that isnt used all the time.   <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Abella ..........65th Archon,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

I am a strong and loving wife, With a husband soon to go. <br>
There are times I'm terrified, In a way most never know.<br>
I bite my lip,and force a smile<br>
as I watch my husband pack...<br>
My heart may break, but I am proud.<br>
My husbands got your back...<br>

<br>
All of a sudden us &quot;lower - mid lvl guilds&quot; (mind you, I think that VoLS and possibly CB are much more credible than the way some so called uber guilds are and ever will be) are going to try to circumvent the system that we are a part of and uphold on a daily basis?<br>
<br>
Get a grip people.  These issues are petty.  <br>
<br>
Some may not be concerned about us getting in your sandbox, and others may be.  But the end result is,  if someone is capable to be flagged for a zone, whether it be through a quest (which btw, does not follow the timeline that SOE set up, it is an alternate means of entry into the zone) or through killing a mob,  then good for them.  <br>
<br>
I love how everyone just itches for something to blow out of proportion and turn into a huge ordeal.<br>

<br>
Am i the only one here that knows that it IS possible to skip emp and VT timesinks and go to the elemental planes without them? and that it is NOT difficult?<br>
<br>
Come on... what are the hard mobs pre elemental? Mithaniel marr? He is a joke. bertox? sure he hurts, but he has 0 hp and a half. agnaar? easy and fun fight. Saryrn? ahahaha.<br>
<br>
Rallos zek then? Come on, RZ isnt THAT hard. he is a test. I liked the update on tindi homepage because it is what the encounter is all about. i will quote kapen here : <br>
<br>
&quot;The Rallos Zek event isn't just about being in a guild powerfull enough to to get him to 0%. It's about the glue that holds your guild together&quot;<br>
<br>
RZ is all about wiping and rewiping and re re wiping and at each wipe you learn how to move one step.<br>
<br>
I am not saying VT gear is useless. Vt gear helps yes, but no it isnt mandatory. i would even add that VT is what can destroy a guild, due to the timesinks. and when you FINALLY are in VT?? woohooo welcome to the most boring zone ever. <br>
<br>
Dont misquote me, i am not saying that every guild could be in elemental planes next week. Of course not. it requires some good guys and some stuff. it requires more than anything motivation. it requires time. time to learn the mobs.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Malaka,what guilds are you thinking about?&quot; Well,my opinion, that engage just me, is that guilds like FK, LoM, SOTE or VoF shouldn't bother with VT. I know one won't bother with it. Time will tell if i am right. And i am sure i am. <p>&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;new&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=156296&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Malaka's Profile&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eanofvols>Ean of Vols</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/4/03 3:54:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Not worth it</span><hr size=1> lol<br>
