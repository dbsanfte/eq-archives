I've read about people in big guilds getting loot which IMHO is taking candy from babies.  Those people have far more opportunities to get far better stuff from their guild raids.  If they're going to help CoG, they should be altruistic about it.  It's kind of like people donating to charity for the sole purpose of getting the charitable tax deduction.  Thats not altruism.<br><br>Though I don't think the loot should be level-restricted.  I think it should be restricted on the person's guild and what other Kunark dragon rotations they're in.  Kunark dragons drop the same stuff.  If they have another source for the loot via the Kunark dragon rotations then they should not loot from Vox/Naggy.  Vox and Naggy KCoG raids are the only source for epic pieces etc. for people in guilds that aren't in any rotations.

I don't have a problem with support groups being able to roll on items, as long as it doesn't get out of hand.  Unfortunately I think that at some point you have to admit that.  In their defense though for example on the paladin book there were 3 paladins that came to help with support group, and only one paladin actually rolled.  The other two 53+ paladins came not even taking a chance at getting the book.  On the other side of the coin I noticed a bit of a disturbing trend that I kind of took exception to, and that was that some people were bringing people to raid, and then logging onto another class (paladins) to roll for their epic items.  I don't really agree with that, and didn't really like that at all.  But I (as a temp raid leader) decided not to rock the boat over it, and so let it pass.  Personally, I do come on these raids for fun, I don't expect to win items, and I do expect to die.  For instance tonight I did not even roll on anything (though the rezz stick was tempting).  If you are coming along just for loot or epic drops (and some of you were pretty blunt about saying so), then do not come.  I think that I speak for the majority of people that come for a good time by all that if all you are coming for is the drops then don't come, we don't need you.  <br><br>Come for fun, or not at all.  If you happen to win an item, that is just gravy.  That is what KCoG is all about, and I think that you are right that some people have lost that direction. <br><br>Just my two cents, Don't take it personally as it is just my opinions.<br><br>Farrnusno<br>Guild Leader<br>Souls of the Valiant <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulagdalentarcho.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lagdalen Tarcho</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Companion</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(6/30/02 12:52:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.engtong.com/Valoran/images/60x60/lagdalen60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Support Groups</span><hr size=1> Since I'm the one that started the &quot;support groups can roll&quot; thing, leme explain why I did it back then.<br><br>Just after SB had stepped down from leading there was obviously a fear of a new leader. Those being Flarren and I with support from FoF. We had many discussions with higher enders and came to the conclusion that killing the dragon itself would be alot easier if we had access to the higher end buffs. That meant a support group. It also meant that people wouldn't be as fearful if there was possibly a stick cleric on hand, you see the benefits.<br><br>Now the support group back then usually consisted of 1 to 2 groups of lvl 60's. Each one had a specific purpose in being there and they were a great deal of help in the long run. btw if you've never killed a dragon without 53+ help, I suggest you give it a shot sometimes and enjoy your zerg or fail. <br><br>Now along with allowing them to go I had to at least make it worth their while, afterall how can you ask someone to come help you with nothing in return. So they were offered a chance to roll. It was also expected that if they already had a shot at that loot or if they had a chance to get better that they did NOT roll and instead let a raider get it. Most of the support people that helped on my runs never lottoed but we were always grateful for their presence.<br><br>Wether they got in the fight or not is inconcequental when you look at what they help you to do. Dragon raids used to be on average 7hrs+ EVERY time. Now they are down to what... 4hrs?<br><br>Perhapse it's time the rules were revised, who knows. I dont lead the runs anymore so it's not my call. I am telling you why I allowed them to roll in the first place and I believe very strongly that if they were un needed on the raids, they would have been asked to leave and denied loot a long time ago.<br><br>The people who have no buisness on the runs are the greedy loot whoreish arses who show up regularily. There is an easy way to solve this though. If they cannot benefit the raid to an acceptable ammount (ex. lvl 60 pallie that has BMB) dont take them for support group. If the person is 53 and just wants a shot, too bad, they dont have anything to contribute more then a 52 could. THAT is how my support groups were... but as some of you may remember I was a biatch sometimes anyway and everyone knew it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Limit your lvl to like 55+ only or, useful classes only or something and you'll find you drop the deadbeat jerks and get the people that really do want to help.<br><br><br>PS.

Tonight was a prime example, I noticed someone I knew (not mentioning names here) inc for the raid. Now already knowing that there was like 14 or more support peeps including an epic cleric, I asked him why is he inc with his 60 warrior and cleric (forget lvl). LOL and he said 'loots'. Then went on to tell me how he needed an RBB and his cleric could use the eyepatch and white scale. I said that is typical greed, and he cant roll with both his toons. Well to make a long story short he started cussing me out (which was was reported and petitioned on) and put on ignore. Then he got on 2 other toons to send me tells and harrass me more. It's crazy!! Then I hear that someone was complaining in chat that 'his' guild can do vox in 3 hours, well excuse me, but why is someone here when his guild is on vox rotation? And for pally's to log on just to roll for the book then not even play those toons is way out of line.  IMHO 1 group of support is sufficent for the dragons, and I do believe they should be able to roll on something for all their help. But then again, if they are in a guild that is capable of and is on rotation for dragons, should they really take away from the people that cant? You know what I do is on sign ups, I sign up Teressa my 51 monk, then state that I have a lvl 60 epic cleric if needed for support. That way the raid leader can see who is signed up for support and can determine what classes are needed to make a good strong support group. CoG was never about the loots, but the thrill of taking targets down for people that dont have that oppertunity. I would hate to see that change  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p>Abreanna Darkangel <br>60 Cleric</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unamiena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Namiena</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/30/02 2:08:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=varalla>Varalla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(6/30/02 5:03:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://sdg6.homestead.com/files/ICON.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KCoG dragon support groups</span><hr size=1> Interisting.<br><br>Here be me scoop on all of this.<br>Back in March I think I got invited to do a Naggy raid.<br>I nae ever even dreamed I would get an opportunity to fight one.<br><br>Twas Azure that let me go and I didnae even know what the Dragons drop.<br>(I had considered dragons WELL beyond me reach)<br><br>Thankie to the KCoG I had a second opportunity to fight Naggy, and last night Vox.<br><br>Now that I be 53 again I had planned on coming to support.<br>(Although from what I read I'm nae really needed yet, so Ill level to 55 first)<br><br>Why?<br>I'm nae really big on the loot and do nae really care for any giant XP.<br>(I got me Seb key for Heavens sake)<br><br>I plan on doing it because I appreciated how KCoG made it possible for me to fight these Dragons and I wannae continue to be apart of it.<br><br>Im going to have to say me opinion be support shouldnt roll.<br>If they need an incentive then they nae supporting the spirit of what it be all about.<br>In me eyes anyway I do nae know much about KCoG, but when I hit 55 I plan on coming and supporting because I wannae be apart of what I see as special.<br>Let the youngsters have the loot.<br>To date the Dragon raids Ive been on have been me high point of the game.<br>I do nae need an incentive to help out those who brought me those high points.<br><br>--=(ßaroness Varalla Griƒƒinsbane)=--<br>53 Champion of the Shadowstormers <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/useisekerrswiftstrike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seisekerr Swiftstrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(6/30/02 6:42:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: KCoG dragon support groups</span><hr size=1> Well I already talked to the original poster, but ill say it here too.<br><br>Ill admit it, I came on the raid for white scale -- not the only reason -- but a big factor.

However, you don't need 2-3+ support groups, you need one good one. If you have 20 people level 53+ show up, then the raid leader should pick six of them that are going to help the most, and then tell the rest of them thanks for your support and goodnight. Now having said that, I personally think that members of the support group should be allowed to roll on loot, given their contribution to the overall raid. <br><br>I certainly don't agree with people switching to alts just to roll on a piece of loot. The ONLY case where this should be allowed is if someone wants to bring one character, but the raid leader specifically asks them to bring a different character to make the raid a success. In those cases, that person is still only allowed to roll on one of their toons. If you allow people to roll for alts that don't participate in the raid, you might as well just let everyone roll on everything. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51270"><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~davidfinley815/newSigSmall03.jpg" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uladyazureskye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LadyAzureSkye</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lady of the Mist</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(6/30/02 1:38:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Support Team and Raids</span><hr size=1> &lt;pulls out her soapbox&gt;<br>Sit down because this is going to be one long post. <br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> But</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->,you will not find anything like it on this forum.

If any mob in the lair sees them, she banishes them from the Zone. Yes they end up in Everfrost just outside the Permafrost zone. So besides pulling the lair, timing is the biggest factor. If the lair is pulled too early, it could mean all those baddies popping on top of the buffline, or during Corpse Retrieval. And sometime Corpse Retrieval is done with Vox still alive. Ice Giants repopping is NOT a pretty sight.<br><br><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Nagafen</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>From the zone in to Sol B, raiders may have to pass kobolds, sonic bats, lava duct crawlers, beetles, and stone spiders. Depending on if these are camped or not, the actually raiders will usually have to clear as they go due to spawn rates. Once we reach the Fire Giant areas (they are tougher than Ice Giants) there are 15 Fire Giants, including King Tranix and Warlord Skarlon. Inside the Lair is 3 Fire Giants and Lord Nagafen. One of the Fire Giants is right behind Naggy (kissing up Im sure). Same rules here for Dragon Aggro. Under level 53 is slaughtered, over level 53 is banished to outside the zone. All Fire Giants are on a 7-8 hour spawn timer. So killing them during a raid, we usually don't worry about Fire Giant repops. BUT there have been times when we have gone in and most of the Fire Giants are dead (even though there is a rule that the guilds on our server have promised to follow about NOT killing FG's if Nagafen is up. More people need to be educated about it). Who killed them? When did they kill them? Will they respawn during raiding, buffing, etc? Nice to have a support team to deal with any unexpected repops.<br><br>Support team does ALOT more than sit on the wrong ramps to Vox's lair. They risk as much, if not more, than those actually killing the dragon. They clear the path, keep it clear, time repops, and do Corpse Retrieval. After a total wipeout, a good support team can make the difference between a 5 hour Corpse Retrieval and a 1 hour Corpse Retrieval.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Buffline</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Most of our buffline consists of actual raiders. Occasionally we are graced with higher levels and thier buffs, summoned items, and mana songs. Many do not think buffs are too important. Dragons dispell. Why it is important to get your buffs in the proper order. Do you want your HP buff dispelled first? I think not. Getting the proper buffs and in the correct order are crucial to the outcome of a raid.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Trust. Respect. Attitude</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Trust</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>When you go on a raid, you put your trust in that raid leader.

It is earned thru words and actions, or lack thereof. It is earned thru upholding values.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Attitude</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Your attitude does not just affect you. It affects all you come in contact with. Attitude can be just your being in general or it can be focused at a cetain item, situation, or person. <br><br>These three attributes have always been a concern to me, in and out of the game, in all my dealings.<br><br>Different people, different opinions, different perspectives, different goals. I would like to think that all who come on KCoG raids have the same goal. But I am fully aware that is not the case. There is nothing wrong with having different priorities and goals. But to accomplish what you desire from the game you need to be with those who have the same goals, attitudes, and focus, as your own. <br>If you are not here to have fun, meet your fellow Karanians, and experience the thrill of working together to take down a dragon, then go somewhere else.<br><br>-----------------------------------------<br>All that being said, I would like to address the comments and concerns of this post.<br>I do believe that people took advantage of a substitute raid leader last night. I was there mainly as an observer and organizing the buffline. I observed alot of comments and behavior I did not like.<br>Last night is the most we have ever had show up for support team. We had alot of new faces and also those who have continued to support KGoC events over and over.<br><br>The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> attitude</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the support team should be first and foremost to &quot;support&quot; the raiders, not for loot. But I also feel that they sacrifice enough to be given an option to lotto on dragon loot. I usually KNOW my support team and they have come to more than one raid with me. I am also willing to give those I don't know a fair chance. So at this point it comes to a matter of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> trust</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. I trust my support team to roll on items that they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> need</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and not just something they will give away, sell, or can get from another source. This shows <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> respect</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for your fellow players. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Support team will still be able to lotto for items.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>As far as support team bringing alts and rolling, it has always had to be approved by the raid leader. For an example, one of our support/ buff team had a cleric for the raiding and a druid for the buffing. Obviously clerics are very important to a raid. But last night we were in need of a druid to cast Circle of Summer. So she toggled between two toons. Usually in cases as this, the player may chose to roll for either the cleric OR the druid, but not both. And the toon they are rolling for HAS to be involved in the raid in some way.. either as support or raider. This actually occurs quite often but ALWAYS has to be approved by the raid leader ahead of time.<br><br>I always try to be unbiased and fair, and not showing any favoritism. I listen to people's concerns and post when necessary.

As has been posted before and will be posted again without the support group (both with buffs and clearing) you can just go ahead and add 3 4 hours to the length of any KCoG dragon raid, and reduce the chance of success by about 40%.  Simple as that, they come and help us out tremendously, even if they don't directly help take out the dragon it would be MUCH harder for us to do it without them.  Any problem that I have is with the attitudes of said people coming and the sheer amounts.  At one point I near the beginning of the raid when people were just showing up we had around 50 people in EF, and 18 of them were 53+!  Now I appreciate that most of them did not roll on most of the items, and they helped out a good bit.  <br><br>But seriously do we need almost half of the people that show up to be support?  Do we need people among those that blatantly state that they are there to roll on the loot?  Believe me, if I had been more than a temporary standin for Azure I think some things might have changed pretty quick.  If I had felt it my place to do it I would have told Steelheart to pick his group, and sent the others off, for as much as we need support we don't need half of the 53+ people on the server running support for us, especially when they say in open channel (as I noticed several of them did, especially at the end of the raid) that they were just here for the roll on possible epic items.  If you do not feel any other call than the loot, or if that is your main reason for being there then I could live without seeing you there.  That said if you are coming to help out and have fun, and if you happen to win something that would work too, then that is great.  I do not have a problem with support rolling as long as the spirit of KCoG is upheld (and Azure has always done a great job of making sure that we walk that fine line, as have all of the previous raid leaders)<br><br>I do want to recognize those people that came to help out, and asked nothing in return.  There were several, and unfortunately I was too busy to take names of those people, but let me say that people like you are appreciated and the reason an organization like KCoG can exist.<br><br>As for the people switching alts in, I really do not like that.  I said it in my first post and I will say it again.  I am not going to name the names (it is a moot point anyway), but two people (actual 40 52 raiders, not support group) switched over to paladins just so that they could roll on the book.  These were not asked to bring one over the other, and this was not a case of being an exception.  At the time I (as in just about every other point during the night) was holding 5 10 conversations and I had not researched past history at that point, and had no time to ask Azure about how she handles this (besides which she was probably as bad off at that point as I was, while she was commanding the buffline).  As such I decided not to rock the boat and did not prevent it from happening.  Looking back in my log to how it went down it was obvious from their tones in /tells that they were taking advantage of the fact that I was new to leading vox, and decided to run over me.  Now that I have had time to look over the circumstances, and graze through old conversations on the board, as well as Azure's statement I would say that that is the one thing about last night that I would like to take back and redo.  It is moot because a book did not even drop, but it is kind of a point of pride for the KCoG and to allow that kind of stuff to go on leaves a slight bad taste in my mouth.<br><br>All that said any changes to be made, or rules to be clarified are Azure's to do.  It is her place as the KCoG Dragon Raid Liason to make decisions like this, and no matter what decisions they are I for one will support her.  She has always done a great job, and until she tires of the experience she will continue to do a great job.  And to be truthful, if I never got to roll on an item again, I would still show up to as many as I possibly could, and I hope that most of you can say that honestly as well.

I was stunned to say the least with the number of people that showed up to support all you in your raid. But I also have to says maybe we just had to many support, I personally would never turn anyone way that wanted to help. There is different reasons for people to show up and support CoG raids and I'm not there to question those reasons. <br><br>I had tons of people send me tells asking me about loot, I don't do loot, I do support, Loot is up to the Raid leader. If your in Support and the Raid leader says you can roll, then do, if you come to a raid for the only reason to get loot? I don't want to hear about it. No one does. Do your job, roll and if you win or loss, live with it. <br><br>I really think the last raid was rare in the number of support people that show up, normally there is only a handful, we are lucky if we can make a group. Really I think a good support group really shines when it comes to CRs. And thank the Gods most of you have never have to gone through that. Just take a couple of seconds to think of how your corpses may come out of the pits, or how your corpses gets pulled from the lair. Also think about who will clear the giants that spawn when you're doing the CR and all standing around naked. Just because there hasn't been a fire in your location in the last 2 years does that mean you should remove your local fire department.<br><br>Hey just for your Info. I died 2 times last night.

Damn younguns! :P<br><br>KCoG was NOT created just to do dragon raids and planes raids for people who couldn't otherwise do them. It was created to do things that did not involve raiding, items, experience gathering or loot at all, because it seemed that the attitude of the server community was focusing on those things alone, and forgetting things like roleplaying, togetherness and pure fun. I gathered together the leaders of as many guilds on the server as would come to create a very loose organization that would provide support to anyone on the server willing to do player-driven events for anyone, regardless of guild affiliation. Things like roleplaying storylines, arena tournaments, silly Valentine Dances and Naked Ogre Relay Races. In time, I hit upon the idea of Mixer Hunts, which would gather large scale raid bodies together from any guilds as training/preparation for doing large scale raids such as dragon and planes raids. Learning the discipline needed by raiders, as well as by leaders was what those were all about. <br><br>Soon after that, Jzonn and Ikada of (at the time) the Avenging Crusaders asked if they could use the KCoG platform to try to run dragon raids, and Zellex of the Watchmen asked if he could lead a KCoG raid into the Plane of Fear. Why? Because they wanted to, and because their respective guilds wanted to learn how to run these things for their own guilds. At first, I was hesitant, because these things can often be very loot centric. But I decided in the long run, providing this kind of opportunity to those who were not currently Karana Guild Central (not Karana Council of Guilds) members (which at the time was composed of less than 20 guilds), was exactly what the KCoG was about. Providing experiences led by other players. So they went ahead and tried them. <br><br>It took a while before we got our first win against a dragon, Nagafen. A lot of folks died trying to beat that dragon. Zellex had some successes and some failures with planes raids. After 6 months to a year of these guys running the raids, I decided to bring my own alliance (Sacred Band) in to help run them. Zellex and the SB raid teams began jointly running the planes raids, and Jzonn had decided to stop running the dragon raids. It was during this time that I decided, as raid leader, to restrict the dragon raids to only those players who were level 52 and under. There was no support team, and I didn't figure on anyone over 52 wanting to come help out on the raids, since they couldn't fight. So it wasn't really an issue of support teams rollilng. After about 6 months, I decided it was time for the SB alliance to do their own raids, and stepped down from leading CoG raid events. Soon after, Lagdalen took up the slack. <br><br>Lagdalen first asked me if I'd considered using support groups of 53+, and after having done that with the SB alliance, I agreed it was a good idea. Why? Because KCoG dragon raids took as long as 7 hours, and if we messed up and died, we usually needed 53+ support to help us recover bodies. With a good support team of even 1 group of 53+ folks, the giants dropped like flies, cutting at the very least 1 hour off of the raids. Making raids like this shorter is a good thing, especially when they come on weeknights. Those people who come to fight the giants and help in the buffline give up their time just like anyone under 53, and they can die just as easily against the giants, losing experience (which translates to time) just like anyone else. You bleed, you roll has always been one of my strongest beliefs with loot. It isn't always literal, as some things get restricted by class, but the spirit is there. <br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If the raid is being done for the experience (the kind that doesn't show up in your experience bar) and the fun, everyone deserves a chance to get some reward. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Does the CoG need 18 people 53+ to do the raid? No, technically it doesn't need any 53+ folks, but it sure makes the raid go smoother, and recovery go quicker. Given that the raid leader will probably spend at least 1-3 hours more time setting up before and cleaning up after the raid, anything that cuts his/her time down is a definite boon. It's up to the raid leader to decide whether to use the support people, and the raid leader CAN restrict them from rolling, if he or she wishes. I'd hope they wouldn't, except in extreme circumstances, and I'd hope any support person that came would take whatever decision was made in stride. Azure's post hit the nail on the head about respect, trust and what she expects, and I'd suggest that anyone that has a problem with my message reread hers.<br><br>Finally, to EDITED, whoever he or she may be, please, don't come back to a CoG raid. That kind of attitude not only is not wanted or needed, it is totally counter to the reason the raids are being run. While I don't necessarily agree with people using an open channel to tell you off, hearing STFU was certainly what you needed and deserved. It might have been harsher than what I'd have told you in a open channel, but it's message would have been the same. My message would have read, &quot;This is not the place to equip you, to ensure your epic, or to fill your coffers. This is the place to have fun. If you did not have fun doing this raid, I suggest you not return to another COG raid, as you won't get anything more out of this type of raid.&quot;<br><br>Sorry for the history lesson, folks, but sometimes it helps to know what has gone before so as to avoid repeating mistakes in the future. <p>Haemish MacLennan<br>Founder<Br>Karana Council of Guilds<br>"I don't play role-playing games to be a politician."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulogan42.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Logan42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/1/02 11:35:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Clarification Part 2</span><hr size=1> After reading my posts again let me clarify something that I think I left a bit ambiguous.  We definitely need the support group, the raids would not be nearly what they are without them.  My personal feelings (which should not come into play while Azure is leading these raids) is that we should limit them to what we need, and those that do come are allowed to roll.  I don't really have any problem with as much as two groups of support, even though most leaders have said that that is more than necessary.  What I feel is that either the raid leader, or the support group commander (usually Steelheart) should pick out what they need and send home the rest with a thanks for coming.  <br><br>The support groups job is very dangerous, and they deserve the chance to roll with the rest of us, do not doubt that.  For instance, look on the thread that I bumped and you can see how difficult the support group (especially it's command) can be.  Steelheart especially shows the true spirit of the KCoG when he comes.  He shows up every chance that he can (and I do not believe I have ever seen him roll, though I have not looked out for him so cannot be sure).  He adds morale support for us all, and helps out every way that he can.  I don't think any of us could count the sheer number of times he has died for KCoG (and I don't think I want to).<br><br>The point that I am trying to make is that the people on the support team should be able to roll, as they are under as much (if not more) pressure than us.  We just need to look at we have each raid, and decide if we need them all, especially if they are openly there for loot (which I believe really hurts morale).  The reason I say this is because there were two people that were to some extent openly there for the loot (and I will not name names here), and there were several people that sent me tells as being ready to walk out of the raid because of statements they made to that effect.  I managed to calm those people down, but morale was definitely affected.  Whatever decisions are made, I know they will be best for the KCoG, and that is what matters for me.  <br><br>I am here for the fun and fellowship, the loot (if I ever get another piece of it) is just possible gravy.  If you come in with that expectation, then you will never be disappointed and you will have much more fun.<br><br>Haemish, thank you for the history and your support!  KCoG would not be the same without your sponsorship and your support, even if it had come to exist in the first place.<br><br>-Farrnusno<br>Guild Leader<br>Souls of the Valiant <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzizzerzazzerzuz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zizzerzazzerzuz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/1/02 12:21:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> my 2 cp</span><hr size=1> anyone wanna hear what i think? no? too bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>first of all, one support group w/ 6 higher level people<br><br>cleric (rez's &amp; buffs)<br>tank ( not puller )<br>melle ( puller )<br>shaman ( buffs )<br>druid (  buffs ) <br>rogue ( corpse recovery ) <br><br>lower level bards and chanters are fine for buff lines and higher level chanters/bards are not needed in this group.<br><br>.. i agree they should get to roll on loot ... but more then one support group is not necessary.. why? all the other raiders SHOULD BE INVOLVED in killing giants and etc during the non-dragon part of the raid... they need to learn also, not just be lead in by the hand to the dragon.<br><br>the only exception to this rule is Kommisar, who has shown over the last few YEARS extreme dedication to KCoG and, if i ever lead KCoG dragon raids, there will be NO rolling on the paladin quest books...  and if two drop, Kommisar gets both <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *jk*<br><br>we must be honest with ourselves, loot is why we come,  but making loot your <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> reason for comming, is the best reason to stay the F- home.<br><br>KCoG has grown in the last 12 months.. i remember a time when killing the dragons made me wet myself ... now its <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> almost</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> expected that we will win.... and yes, support groups are part of this reason.<br><br>i have been on many a raids with Destructress and Zizzerzazzerzuz, and never won anything, but i hope to win something someday, but if i dont, i still feel good about who ever did win something and being part of helping them get that loot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>peace and love<br>Destructress Fyrestarter<br>&lt;Children of Disorder&gt;<br><br><br>p.s. yes im the one who allways bitches about not enough INT caster loot, and will continue to do so untill my lips are sowed shut <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ualthalonas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Althalonas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord of the Mist</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/1/02 3:09:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my 2 cp</span><hr size=1> Wow its sad to see people trying to use the CoG this way that was never why Haemish created this organisation <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I have not been able to make it to many of the recent CoG dragon raids but when I have come as support I would never ask roll on loot.

If all you are here for is the loot then you are gonna be disappointed. Very little loot drops from a dragon raid and with so many people your chances of getting some of it are slim to none.<br><br> Since Azure was involved in the conversatoin with edited i would bet money that that person is never included in another KCoG dragon raid again. <br><br>And Haemish beat me to the punch. Kcog was NOT founded to do dragon and planes raids. It was founded to help create a feeling of family in the Karana community. Most if not all of the events sponsered by KCoG in its early days were centered around things like picnics and wine sanpling contest and easter egg hunts and such. Only later was it decided to use the comminuty that had developed to attempt to take down Vox and Naggy with a collection of smaller guilds that , by themselves, would not have the opportunity to do so. <p>Falcone Robinsbane<BR>Master Smith<BR>Master Forager<BR>Master of Running Away<BR>Officer in Children of Disorder<BR>Reaper of Storms for 52 seasons<BR></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=244.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=244.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=244.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=244.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.threadControl?topicID=244.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=244.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=244.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="councilofguildsgeneral">General<option value="councilofguildscouncildiscussions">Council Discussions<option value="councilofguildsevents">Events<option value="councilofguildscogplanesraidschedule">CoG Planes Raid Schedule<option value="councilofguildsfrm8">CoG Dragon Raids<option value="councilofguildsguildwars">Guildwars<option value="councilofguildshelpitemswanted">KCoG Bazaar<option value="councilofguildsintroduceyourguild">Introduce Your Guild<option value="councilofguildsguildalliances">Guild Alliances</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8>CoG Dragon Raids</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT --><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="javascript" TYPE="text/javascript" src="http://www.ezboard.com/bravenet/ads04/ads.txt"></script><noscript><div align="center"><iframe src="http://www.ezboard.com/bravenet/ads/eznoscript1.htm" frameborder="0" scrolling="No" width="756" height="117" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" style="border-width:1px; border-color:000000; border-style:solid;"></iframe></div></noscript><!-- END BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT --></CENTER><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
