Theres no excuse for this behavior and he prompty logged with no apology or reason. I apologize for the people that came and lost the chance to roll on this item because of Ninjawort.<br>
<br>
I ask you to ban this fuckstick from any groups. I dunno how he got in raid and don't care, im interested in his lame reply to this post ... like there ever will be any. <br>
Disavowed I would be more careful about your recruitment policies in the future.<br>
<br>
Anyways hope to see you around Wortman <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

He is a real life friend of mine and i got him into playing everquest. <br>
<br>
I am here on his behalf though and for those of you that know my char. and personality must know I wouldnt vouge for or partake in something that was done wrongly on purpose. I may be partly to blame for this as I have given him the skills and equipment to level to quickly he has never had the oppurtunity to be wowed by emporer crush's axe or other trivial things.<br>
<br>
I suppose i robbed him by leading him too far, too fast without allowing him to pick up some general game etiquette on his own. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose and i have learned a great deal from this experience as well. Allow a person to grow naturally first then help that person out. <br>
<br>
I assure you it was not done on purpose as in real life i know him and he is always giving. Thinks of himself last. He is used to bieng in groups where the loot code is always just kill and loot. Never been in a big encounter. Never been in the situation where loot actually mattered.<br>
<br>
For example I offer you this, Why would a paladin of any kind of evil knowledge of the game want to loot this cloak? This is nothing he will wear in the future because there are far superior cloaks for him do be wearing? <br>
<br>
Also as far as him logging out right away how would you feel, not knowing alot about this game, with alot of people yelling at you and screaming how your reputation is toast and how you are going to get trained on purpose. Telling him he is an evil ninja looter and so forth. He did apologize after he did it (I beseech you to ask Lois because she saw it) with a simple sorry. The flames kept coming and i am sure he felt very small and very bad. I cant say i wouldnt log as well.<br>
<br>
This was Purely, and i swear on my name and as a player done out of lack of knowledge. I offer my sincere apologies to LoL and if there is personally anything i can do to make up for this please do not hesitate to send me a tell in game. <br>
<br>
Honestly i can do nothing else but make this reply to this flame for those of you that hold Wortman in contempt because of this then so be it, all i can explain is what happened and apologize and let you know it wasnt done on purpose. <br>
<br>
He is and one day will be one of the most stand up guys you will meet on this server, I swear it. To those that wish to bring retribution to him for doing this, then you are petty petty people. But I will stand by him during all of this because i know him as a person and know how he is in real life. <br>
<br>
Again my apologies to LoL for the mishap and to everyone else that reads this do NOT think he is a bad person because he is not. <br>
<br>

P.S. If you would like to continue this further Daserack send me a tell in game But I will not have you calling him a F***stick. This is very important as i tried talking to you afterwards to explain to you but you were too hot-headed to listen to me and way to eager to post your flame. You were still sucking your thumb and peeing yourself doing the newbie armor quests after a week. Regardless do anything to him in-game to him and i assure you i have nothing more important then to uphold his honor. Whatever you do to him will be returned to the fullest and best of my abilities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loiseq>Loiseq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/8/03 5:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1404.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wortman the ninja </span><hr size=1> As I know as trust Fuearye, I know that what she said happened  was the case.  I think that Wortman being excited about killing a dragon, (maybe his first raid ever) rushed to see what dropped.<br>
<br>
And I am guessing he accidently had his options set to autoloot and instead of just looking, he looted.  True, he should not have rushed to the corpse even to check like that, but i think he really didn't understand that he might loot an item by checking.<br>
<br>
Right away he sent me a tell and said &quot;sorry&quot; followed by &quot; i will give it to you&quot;.  I responded that &quot;its no drop&quot;. Then everyone at the raid was screaming about his looting and i think he just panicked.   I asked him to tell me what happened and he  never responded. When i asked again i saw he had logged.<br>
<br>
<br>
I do think that he should have at least tried to explain to all there that he acidentally looted while trying just to see what dropped. That would have gone a LONG way to calming  everyone down.<br>
<br>
Lots there including myself did petition and a Guide responded to me not long after that.  He said that he escalated the petition to a GM and that they could check what happened and that at his discretion the GM could return the item. <br>
<br>
I hope that Wortman does come to the Boards and explain his side for his sake.  Accidents do happen and I hope people will  forgive him  if he makes an effort to explain. <br>
<br>
Lets try to give the GM a chance to resolve the matter and not have players exact revenge on a newbie for being a newbie.<br>

Instead of power leveling, a better method to indroduce a new person to game is to make a low level toon and group with him. Then you can show him things along the way.

I was faction hunting at the bank area in Kael when 10+ arena giants came running down the tunnel chasing this iksar.<br>
While i didnt die from the event many did die, and the paladin in my group ( low on mana from being the only healer ) was asked to rez all the dead people in the zone. Downtime from having to rez was 30+ minutes.<br>
While I am impressed he can level his character up in a week that he can now hunt in Kael, something gets lost in fast powerlevelling: game experience.<br>

Boy you're fucking clueless. Das has been in existance on this server since the first week of launch.  Newbie armor quests werent a gleam in Abashi's cheeseburger glazed eyes then and mino axes were the uberest weapon known to any.<br>

He's also one of the best known and respected monks on the server, and does NOT flame lightly, look at his postcount.  <br>
<br>
YES your friend was a fucktard, fuckstain, shitstain and what ever else. &quot;He never did any encounters where the loot matters&quot; dosen't hold water either. <br>
<br>
Did he miss 'are you sure you want to loot this NO DROP ITEM' somehow and just blindly click yes? Or did he have it disabled? gee, you need to actually SET that, so why did this 'noobie' do it?    Of course Das wasn't looking to listen to lame excuses.<br>

Take that coupled with the fact that you can survive without him, and there you go. If you don't want to take the chance, leave the guy out of your group. I think Das got his point across.

<br>
BTW, how in the hell did a person <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>new to EQ</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> get a Paladin from level 1 to 48 in 1 week? A Paladin would take me 2 weeks to get that high level and thats if I borrow RL friend's Fungi and CoCW and billions of HP gear and I know exactly where to hunt and would put some effort into it. This story is getting sillyer (can I say sillyer?) as it goes on. <br>

I'm just waiting for the right time to start tossing insults around so lets wrap this mystery up in the next few hours please? <br>

So there really is no excuse for ninja'ing a ND item and then logging without a word to anyone.<br>
<br>
Actually to me...<br>

That sounds like a Ninja Pro - Not a Ninja Newbie.<br>

I was in an LDoN group last week and accidentally destroyed one of those lifetap weapons that drop off named in Mistmoore.  I thought it was one of those crappy 2pp swords and wasn't paying attention.  I immediately brought it to my groups attention, there were 2 members that were fairly pissed.  So I petitioned.  After we won the adventure, I gated to the bank and picked up 4K (which is the going price for that sword) and split it between the warrior and the ranger, since they were the only ones that could weild the sword. (This was an NBG group.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, like 12 hours later, I get a response from a GM finally asking if I would like the sword back.  I told him no, since I had already done right by splitting the proceeds with 2 of the group members.  But my point is at least you can get your item back, even if you just gave it to the GL from LoL and have him determine who gets it or something like that.  I am sure something can be worked out, it just takes some time to get it worked out, haha!<br>

What the fuck is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>this</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> shit?<br>
I remember when I accidentally destroyed an SoS thinking it was a cracked staff - I was in the warrens and had swapped out with a bokken of some sort to see what the graphic was like, had the SOS in the inventory, accidentally destroyed, petitioned.  <br>
