Suria lvl 50 pally = Hellfire, sure  <br>Poppa yelled at suria for starting some stuff in Dreadlands that it turns out AE's leader Jessamyn and a short lived ex member of CoS Larenzo had actually set up to shake up CoS a little (they assume).<br><br>I thought poppa was solid as a rock, so surely it would not start strife in guild. Heck I'd hunted with the guy on sullon zek over a month. But I was wrong and when asked about it pops lashed out like a wounded tiger =P<br><br>Suria left the Guild (CoS) and shortly after I decided to follow. Rather than go the rosalena way and tell everyone what happened and thus get ostrasized from my friends via Senaiel having his thumb stuck in his own butt, I decided to quietly quit the game for a while whilst I cooled off a bit. I gave back all armor I'd been given in guild so nobody owes anyone anything.<br><br>Okay now I accepted it that poppa and suria would just not get along anymore... but eventually she started doing the logical thing.... ignore the little halfin druid that likes to pick fights. <br><br>Most of you from long ago in CoS are still me and Suria's friends. Heck Caledor and Suria even got married (in game) And many of you that ARENT Poppa and Senaiel lead raids right? (Given that poppa and senaiel never let her on their raids even when other non guild peeps went and you had not enough people and ended up in an 8 hour cr anyway.....)<br><br>Bah I wander too much.... <br>well lets go back to um..... last night ^_^<br>Chantis leading a fear raid<br>Suria tells chantis that she'll come if he wants her<br>Chantis says sure =D<br>Suria goes to raid sits in front of fear portal for 30 minutes<br>Chantis tells suria (ad libbed mind you) Yo, sorry pops iz homofag and wont let you come cuz you suxor<br>Ok ok no but chantis says sorry you cant come after discussion in guild. <br>When caledor was asked why this was (and after the 15 person raid goes in and gets wiped out mind you and starts their long long cr) oh lookie, poppa's saying he doesnt want her on his ra..... oh wait! Its CHANTIS' raid isnt it??? =O &lt;-----amazed<br><br>(NOTE chantis Rocks!)<br><br>I'd figure poppa would put it behind him and stick to insulting her (like she does him) purely to our friends here in town (and out of game) rather than continue a pointless vendetta opening wounds that were long healed and picking fights like a sissy girl. <br><br>Pops is getting excentric. He used to be a great leader, but being in his guild and on good favor with him is like walking on the tip of a razor blade. He's great at convincing people to do things. I really couldnt afford to do sullon zek 8 hours a day with him but &quot;since I've already started of course I cant stop&quot; like I'd wanted to (though it was fun ^_^)<br><br>And when we came back to luclin fatty (fatos) was away for soooooo long and here comes poppa lvling him up =D woo poppa..... hahaha funny when fatty left for AC of all things.... ZERG!!!! <br><br>So when fatty left, senaiel becomes main tank for everything ^_^ yaay for him. Usually that goes to the highest and best tank for the raid which often I've seen not be the case... <br><br><br><br><br>Also, while Im sticking to flaming.... /sigh what is with this air of superiority around poppa lately? He's been cramming it down everyones throats how IB and LoS and other guilds are 'getting nervous and afraid about CoS becoming powerful' I've been on IB raids and I've talked to nec about it. Their raids are flawless, and you're laughed at by them for saying that anyone would fear your guild. IB doesnt Fear LoS do they? Does LoS fear IB? Nobody gives a flying faak. <br><br>Grats on taking VS.... without 1 death even! Err but you dont EXACTLY say that you had 3 wipeouts before the flawless victory... again good journalism, very persuasive that hey you guys should go VP now right? =D or ToV even..... North or west wing? Dont know what that is? Oh yeah pops you're still 56.....<br><br>( I refer to the headlines on their website www.hailcos.org )<br><br>As you can see above poppa in the time I've known him has used me (My friends told me from the start but I didnt believe...) and manipulated me to the point where words can cause me such anger that I shake as I type this! Thats worse than if he came to my house and stuck his keyboard in my arse.... <br><br>You've lost many members to this poppa, and you'll lose more. I'll not try to bring them to the golden empire (my 11 ish peeps guild) but you will lose them to your own idiocy. Fair warning.<br><br>Now, on other news =D I got married and joined the navy (yaay) Save for poppa I miss you all (yeah even sen you noob ; ) and hope that me flaming and gnawing away at poppas bubble in attempts to pop it will not change that we're friends. I look forward to your flames back and hope poppa doesnt delete this for &quot;guild strife&quot; or any other gibberish (which doesnt apply to the boards I think the rules state....) so I leave you now with sore fingers from too much typing =P<br><br>Soreah Mourner 30th pally (yeah 4x restarted =P)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uaezon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aezon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tundra Yeti</span><br>  Posts: 424<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/26/02 2:38:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335flamesandrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2219.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.evenstar.ca/wtf/wtfsmall.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poppa You Homofag =P</span><hr size=1> I have no idea what any of this is meant to accomplish =/<br> <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32212'>Aezon Shmaezon</a><br>59 Conjurer<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umrsaiyajin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mrsaiyajin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/26/02 2:41:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335flamesandrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2219.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poppa You Homofag =P</span><hr size=1> Just tired of Poppa being gay towards my wife for a little argument that happened so long ago... =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulifeysavey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lifey Savey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mooooocleric !!</span><br>  Posts: 511<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/26/02 2:47:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335flamesandrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2219.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poppa You Homofag =P</span><hr size=1> poppa and iberar make a good team. <p>Lifey Savey<BR> 60 Human High Priest<BR> MOOO!!<br> <img src="http://www.fazed.net/humor/images/moo.jpg" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unizzysenki.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nizzy Senki</A>&nbsp;

The point of this post was the Flame and Rant. CoS deserves a little of it.<br><br>You have all heard that CoS is the CR queens. They can't do a raid without a few wipeouts. Why? Because most of the good ol' members that kept the guild in their groove have left because of the crazy guildleader, Poppa Cappo.<br><br>Maybe he can hunt with a Chanter, but umm...do you know anyone who CAN'T????<br><br>My husband posted this on the CoS forums and only posted here because there is a Thread called &quot;Flames and Rants&quot;<br><br>This is what I posted as well, if you'd like to compare notes...<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>#1) My Real life friends make it their business when someone does me wrong. That's what friends are for.<br><br>#2) You are the only one that has ever called MY house to discuss anything in regards to this, so actually, this is closer to YOU stalking ME! I have the phone bills to prove it hun ^_^<br><br>#3) You did me wrong Poppa. You did Bippon wrong. He never stole anything from anyone. You did Rosalena wrong. She never took anything from anyone. You did Killhawn wrong. Once in a while people will train to camp in Fear. You did Necreia wrong. CoS barely helped him with his epic and yet YOU took all the credit. You did Ghetaldus wrong. He's on Switzerland time and NO, your guildmembers don't HAVE to come on a raid if they don't want to.<br><br>Guys, need to look at some things, like the TRUTH. I didn't know Soreah was gonna post here, but he has said nothing which is not the truth. When I first left CoS I talked to other guild peeps about you once in a while, and ended up finding I had to DEFEND you. CoS is known to be a little screwy, and EVERYONE knows someone who has been pissed off by Poppa. <br><br>You think that is just a coincidence?<br><br>I've stopped defending you guys cuz I keep getting fhucked by you. I have tried to maintain friendly guild relations, but recently I've found out the bulk of the people I liked in CoS have left, and the rest have turned into Poppa-apes.<br><br>So yes, when someone jokes with me about how you guys are the best CR team on Luclin, I will laugh with them, and yes, when someone talks about Poppa being just the right height to suck @#%$, yes, I will agree.<br><br>Sorry to make it painfully obvious, but I was talking to another ex-CoS member last night and we could come up with about 20 names of good players who left because of Poppa. Sorry if I find that a little amazing....never heard of so many peeps leaving ANY guild for 1 person...<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I had some friends in CoS for a long time, but I'm tired of them sucking Poppacock... I don't care if they don't like me after this.<br><br>Oh, but then shouldn't I? Poppa is soooo adamant that IB and LoS is scared of CoS because they are getting SOOOO BIG!!!<br><br>ROFL...you hear that?<br><br>Hey IB, LoS...I don't like your uber guild attitude, but at least you know what the fhuck you are doing on raids. You know your @#%$. You don't CR like a hamster in a wheel.  Are you scared of CoS? Poppa makes sure everyone is aware that you are in Guildchat all the time...<br><br>The point of this thread is to flame CoS's guildleader, because he's an @#%$, and he's done a lot of bad @#%$ to a lot of good people. Including but not limited to me, my husband, and many other cool peeps.
