Young One.&quot; <br>
<br>
Renaisse smiles warmly as she gestures you further into her tent.  The floor is covered with exotic animal skins, some of which you do not recognize, and a fire burns brightly in the center, the flames dancing in multicolored hues. <br>
<br>
&quot;Please sit down, and let me get to know you a bit.&quot;  Her voice is deep... distractingly so for a woman, and the timber of it seems to reach into you as you listen to its melody.  &quot;I like to hear stories... to meet people.  I have heard so many, but they are always a pleasure to me.&quot; <br>
<br>
She brushes the hair from her face, and you notice there is something different about her, but you cannot quite place it.  Her skin is the color of warm chocolate, and her eyes...at first they seem black, but perhaps it is the fire... maybe it is the wine you had for dinner, but they are changing... the color is magnificent, as you catch yourself... gazing into them.  The world around you seems to slip away. <br>
<br>
She giggles softly, averts her eyes for a second, and the fog that started to surround you lifts. &quot;I apologize.  I forget how easily it is to... distract others.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Please... can I get you something?&quot;  She smiles, hands you a bowl of fruit, and pulls two glasses from a knapsack.  The wine she pours into your glass is dark, smelling sweet and earthy at the same time.  &quot;I got this from a vender down in Neriak today.  She was most hospitable, and swears it is the best she has ever had.  I might agree... if I had never tasted the blood wine they make in Cabilis ~ it is very ugly, and the smell is... pungent, but the flavor!&quot;  She grins as she snuggles back against the furs.  &quot;Mmmm..... DIVINE!  The next time I go there, I will try and remember to bring a bottle back to you.&quot; <br>
<br>
She snickers softly.  &quot;Yes... I do travel often.  I have been so many places.  It is part of who I am... part of my nature to wander.  You see...&quot;  She leans closer, and you notice her skin... there seems to be a glow moving under it, and then it is gone.  You think perhaps the wine is too much, but there it is again!  &quot;I am not like you.  This person you see before you does not truly exist... in this form, any longer.  I am a mirror image of a young Erudite woman named Martiina I knew... many many years ago.  She was so beautiful... on the inside and out, that I most often choose her likeness to display, as a tribute for the love we shared...&quot;  She seems to sense your confusion and smiles softly. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am a shape-shifter... a changeling.&quot;  And to illustrate this point, she changes before your eyes... the glow of her skin becoming so bright, and then fades instantly into the porcelain complexion of a beautiful High Elf.  &quot;This is a poor slave girl I met in Ogguk the other day ~ the concubine of a nasty Ogre by the name of Clurg.  She begged me for hours to free her, but, alas, my way is that of neutrality.  I could no more free her from her confines, then I could go back in time to my lovely Martiina and save her from the plague of power created by the Ogres so long ago...&quot;  True sorrow emanates from Renaisse as you see a tear slip down one pale cheek... the glow takes over once again, and she is soon back to the borrowed face of the Erudite woman.  &quot;I shall never love another...&quot;  Her voice fades into nothingness, and she shakes her head, as if to forcefully remove the memory. <br>
<br>
&quot;You have not told me anything about yourself!  Please, please... do not let me dominate the conversation.&quot;  She wipes her face quickly, giggles, and grabs a clump of strangely colored grapes from the bowl, and munches on them with glee.  You have never seen someone so at home with themselves, as she reclines in her furs, eating her fruit... the fire casting marvelous shadows on her skin and hair.  You feel that you could love this woman... truly love her for the rest of your life... maybe you have had enough wine, but you dare not speak as to give yourself away.  &quot;What?   Nothing to tell me?&quot;  She snickers, and replaces the fruit. <br>
<br>
At once, she is on her feet above you, swaying to music you cannot hear, but she IS dancing... slowly to something at first...she notices your confusion and smiles broadly.  &quot;I hear the rhythm of life... the memories of the past... the glory of our kingdom when it was young... these things comfort me.  Oh!  How wonderful it was... to sing beneath our Cold Sun...&quot;  She starts humming, closing her eyes.  The tune is enticing, as she breaks out into a high clear voice, singing words you do not comprehend.  She tries to grab your hands to dance with her, but she quickly twirls away into a fit of giggles, and plunges, not quite so gracefully, back to her seat in peals of laughter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I do apologize!  The past... it is intoxicating to me... the memories!&quot;  She lets out a long sigh and reaches across to pat your arm.  &quot;Friend... please do share my tent this evening.  I get so lonely at night.  I have extra bedding, and the fire will remain constant and warm.  I can talk all night long, if you wish.&quot;  She smiles, and you know there is nothing more you would love to do than to remain here with her forever. <br>
<br>
&quot;Let me tell you more about our Kingdom... how it was in the beginning... I knew this man...&quot;  She smiles sweetly.  &quot;He was... marvelous... a king even!  Talk about stoic... sheesh... it took me 3 hours to get him to smile... but when he did...&quot;  Her voice fades away as you fall into a deep sleep.  Images of a glorious kingdom and a remarkable young Erudite woman named Martiina fill your dreams. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulaeliahwhisperkiss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laeliah Whisperkiss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(9/10/01 9:26:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Part Two</span><hr size=1> Martiina laughs, as you recline with her in your bed...smoothe the hair from her brow, and kiss her gently on the nose.<br>
<br>
She is dark and beautiful...  her laughter is like the tinkling of small bells... and you adore her.  As you gaze into her eyes, you know a true love for her... can feel the power and strength of the emotion well within your chest.<br>
<br>
As she starts to speak, you pretend to be listening, but really you are watching her lips intently... the firelight on them so inviting.  &quot;I think we should travel.  I am weary of this place, and I would like to see what is beyond our kingdom.  It is so perfect here, but I cannot live my life without knowing what is outside these walls.  Just the other day Merrith was telling me of his adventures in a place called Ogguk.  Did you know that Ogres live there?&quot; <br>
<br>
She looks like a child, her eyes so large, and the wonder and awe on her face is contagious, as you watch her relate her story of her conversation with the blacksmith, Merrith.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I am so happy here with you, but I think we could be happy out there too...&quot;  She has been drinking, and she gestures wildly with her arm, nearly smacking you in the head.  She giggles, and reaches across you for the bottle of wine on the bedside table.  &quot;I know you have traveled so much,&quot; she says, poking you in the chest, &quot;but I want to share things with you... share new experiences.  All I know is this little cottage, in this little kingdom, living out my little life...&quot;  She takes a quick drink from the bottle, and smiles.  The glow of the wine is evident in her cheeks, which have rosied considerably in the last few moments, into a full flush.  Not wanting her to fall asleep, you take the bottle from her hand, and try to replace it on the table.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are so silly!&quot;  She says, as she grabs at the bottle, and you spirit it away... just out of her grasp.  &quot;Oh! Play fair!&quot;  She tackles you flat to the bed, sits on you, and wrestles the bottle from your grip.  She takes a drink from it, and bends down to kiss you, her long hair falling to the sides of your face.  You can taste the wine... so sweet.<br>
<br>
A sudden noise jostles you out of your slumber. <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; The look of concern on Renaisse's face is earnest, and it takes a few seconds to realize where you are, and who she is. &quot;You were rolling around, and murmuring.  I thought you might be having a bad dream?&quot;  She hands you a glass of water, but all you long for is wine.<br>
<br>
You cannot look at that face... the face of Martiina.  Afraid that your emotion will betray you, you quickly assure Renaisse you are fine, and turn over in your bed.  As your struggle to return to sleep, return to Martiina, you can hear Ren humming a small tune... it is familiar to you... <br>
<br>
What are the words?  You strain to remember... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulaeliahwhisperkiss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laeliah Whisperkiss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(9/10/01 9:27:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Part Three</span><hr size=1> &quot;That's not how the words go!  You are making it up!&quot;<br>
<br>
You smile at Martiina as she bounds ahead of you on the sand... and giggle as she trips while walking backwards so she can see you.  As you begin to protest in jest, because you know you made the words up to the song, she starts singing in a pure voice, making you jealous at the ease of which she hits the notes:<br>
<br>
&quot;I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. <br>
I do not think that they will sing to me.<br>
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves <br>
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back <br>
When the wind blows the water white and black. <br>
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea <br>
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown <br>
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.&quot;<br>
<br>
She is smiling as she sings the last line, and it seems so profound... walking with her here... along the water's edge.  For just a moment, you seem to sense something... something not right, and then it is gone, on the ocean breeze, lost forever in the noise of the waves.  Martiina skips forward to grab your hands, and you drop your packs to the ground.  She always knows how to make you laugh, and seeing her here... in the sand, skipping and singing, you cannot help but giggle at the complete wonder and naiveté of her.  She is such a child, and a grown woman all at once.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to go to Ogguk!&quot;  She hugs you tightly, and whispers softly in your ear just above the din of the waves... &quot;Please Ren.... please?!&quot;  You start to protest, but she is off again...grabbing the bags, and yells over her shoulder, &quot;I cannot hear you!  Musta been a yes I heard!&quot;<br>
<br>
So that is how it started... the trip to Ogguk.  <br>
<br>
You had been there so many times, and Ogres, for all their smell and lack of tact, were completely harmless.  A gift here... a smile there, and they turn into simple natives, eager to please, and loyal friends.  It had been so long since you had seen some of your acquaintances there...  Of course, you could not change shape.  Not in front of Martiina... she did not know what you were.  All you wanted was to finally live a simple love-filled life... a NORMAL life.  You would have to present yourself in your current form.<br>
<br>
As the trip bore on, and you got closer to the swamp, that feeling... yes... it was fear, crept in and sat like a toad in your heart.  At the time, it seemed silly, so you shoved it down.  Laughed and talked and entertained Martiina through the sands of Ro ~ showed her animals she had never seen before, and told her stories you had heard of these lands and the beginning of existence... how the gods formed each grain of sand from a whisper, polished it with a glint from the sun, and dropped it here, to be warmed by the hot breeze, and swept across the land by time.  Martiina listened intently and giggled with glee as you finished the story... grabbing a handful of sand and blowing it like a kiss across to you.  <br>
<br>
At the edge of the desert, you thought you heard a sound... the breaking of glass... but something much more painful.  Not wanting to move forward, you set up camp in the trees, at the edge of the great desert of Ro, and told Martiina you would scout ahead.  You told her you would be back... you told her it was only a short trip to the Feerrott forest, and once you were sure of the way you would come back for her... a couple hours at most.  Of all the things you told her, of all the mistakes of that moment, did you tell her that you loved her?  You have wondered this for an eternity... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulaeliahwhisperkiss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laeliah Whisperkiss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(9/10/01 9:28:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Part Four</span><hr size=1> I love you Martiina.<br>
<br>
Renaisse hands you a bowl of fruit, while she tends to a pan on the fire.  Morning came too soon, and images and feelings still fresh in your mind haunt your heart, and bind your tongue.  Not even the smell of breakfast cooking can distract you from the pain, and you moan slightly with the anguish of loss.<br>
<br>
I love you Martiina.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you ok?&quot;  You cannot look at Renaisse as she asks this.  You have not been able to gaze at that face at all, when everything in you wants to drink her in... consume her borrowed beauty.   She smiles tenderly as she takes your face in her hands.  &quot;She was the most beautiful... most honest person I ever knew.&quot;  Renaisse smiles knowingly.<br>
<br>
She walks silently to her bed, and produces a small clear bottle from underneath her pillow.  She hands it to you, and sits quietly back down on her bedding.  <br>
<br>
The bottle is full of sand... As you look as Renaisse questioningly, the images start again... the flood of memories foreign, yet familiar to you pour in...<br>
<br>
I love you Martiina.<br>
<br>
You walked ahead to the edge of the swamp, just meandering.  The uneasiness followed you, and you decided to just wander.  You would come back to Martiina in a couple of hours with dinner freshly caught, and tell her you cannot find your way... ask her if she has ever seen Felwithe?  A boat ride and haughty High Elves sounded much more appealing.  You were sure she would agree.  You knew how to get her excited about something.  Perhaps you would show her your magic bag you borrowed from a mage there... how it holds things and they become weightless.  She would surely get excited over that!<br>
<br>
After you procured dinner... a couple of rabbits, you walked back to the camp.  It was getting dark out, and you nearly missed the tent.  There was no fire.   <br>
<br>
There was no fire!  As you rushed into your empty tent, you called out to Martiina... the sound was there... the breaking glass...  the breaking of something....  The pain started to take over.  <br>
<br>
I love you Martiina.<br>
<br>
You wandered the desert for hours, until you encountered an Ogre encampment there...  Changing into the wind, or something just as invisible, you moved in to listen.  There had never been guards this far out, and their presence made you uneasy.  <br>
<br>
What you heard made you even more uncomfortable.  War.  The Ogres were mounting an attack.  They would never been able to do it on their own.... for as powerful as they were, planning was not a part of what they could accomplish.  As you meandered through the camp, the answer became evident... Tier'dal.  Dark Elves with cunning and deceit written on their aura... As you moved through the camp silently,  you found a heavily guarded tent, and entered.  <br>
<br>
Inside the tent, you immediately noticed a Tier'dal warrior... his skull helm gleaming in the firelight.  You could not take your eyes off of him... he looked like the devil himself.  Pure evil.  You watched as he removed his skull helm.  His green eyes as sharp as daggers, and he was smiling.  He called out, and an Ogre guard poked his head into the tent.  &quot;Remove her.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was then... then that the sound... the broken glass... It was then that you realized what it was.  The shatter of your heart at that moment, the sickening disgust as the Ogre dragged your lifeless Martiina out of the tent.  What was left of her... of your last fragment of pure joy in this existence was undescribable... <br>
<br>
The Ogre threw her to the dogs.<br>
<br>
And in that moment... every last remnant of your desire to live went with her.<br>
<br>
I love you Martiina.<br>
<br>
No vengeance.  No fury.  Nothing but void and emptiness.<br>
<br>
You stare at Renaisse... tears slipping down her face as she takes the bottle back from you.  &quot;Sand from underneath our bed... our bed that last night.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;They waged their war... destroyed our kingdom.  I did not care.  I became the wind once again, and moved over this earth for many years... and when my sadness was spent... when the pain of that moment numbed, I decided to help reform our kingdom in Martiina's name.  To make something good come out of this life.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiles reassuringly, and you gaze at that face of pure love, and you understand.<br>

The love of a sea monkey really isnt that lame<br>
We have darkened hearts that in passion burns<br>
But the soul of a woman eventually turns<br>
Loyalty to self is our cry and our creed<br>
and how could it not with their souless greed<br>
To take away a heart that is diabolically pure<br>
Turn to a sea monkey for the only known cure <p>Asmo-
