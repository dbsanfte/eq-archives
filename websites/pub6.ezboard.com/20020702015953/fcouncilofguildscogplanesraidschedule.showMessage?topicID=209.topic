And I have finally come to the conclusion that this Saturday's Plane of Fear raid will be the last regular plane raid that I will be leading with the Karana Council of Guilds.<br><br>This has not been an easy decision.  From the very start of KCoG I've supported the vision of a group of people who are about the fun of doing things.  I've been part of an organization that looks to allow everyone a place in a raid.  It doesnt matter what class you are, what guild, or anything else.  Everyone was welcome and everyone had a chance at the items that dropped.  Over the last year and a half of planar raids the rules havent really changed.  Everyone is still welcome and everyone can roll.  How many other gruilds and alliances can you say that of?  We have remained commited to the Vision that Haemish first proposed so long ago.<br><br>But times have changed.  People have moved on.  The Harbringers who led our first planar raids are now one of the largest and most powerful guilds out there.  The Silver Daggers, who both helped to found KCoG and ran a number of planar raids, have moved on to become one of the largest mid sized guilds on the server.  They have their own alliance and have a reputation for honor and loyalty.  Fellowship of Faydark has always been active in KCoG, and although they have almost ceased to exist I will never forget meeting Lagdalen and Flarren and Talovar deep in Dalnir oh so many many moons ago.  I will always cherish their willingness to allow a druid and shadowknight who were simply there not only into their groups but also as friends.  And yet, today, all of them have moved on.<br><br>The game today is no longer what it was two and a half years ago when I first started.  To me, it has always been the people who have made the game.  And to help others I volunteered to run KCoG planar raids when no one else stepped up.  Not because I wanted to, not because I was qualified to, but because I felt I needed to give back something to KCoG for what they've done for me.  I've met many many friends through KCoG raids, friends that have kept me in the game when everything else said to leave.  Even though I was prepared to join a guild and leave behind KCoG I felt I could not until I had given something back.  Until those who didnt have many of the opportunities that I had were given a chance to experience them as well.<br><br>But the time has finally come.  I have led KCoG plane raids through three full rotations.  It is finally time for me to move on.  My friends are cheerfully waiting for me to join their guild and in good conscience I can no longer hold back.  I have given what I could and now its time to move on.<br><br>This does not mean I am done with KCoG.  Far from it.  I will lead the occasional raid somewhere.  Still have to do a PoA raid.  And of course I, as well as Zellex and Kommisar and so many other leaders, will remain as a resource that can be called upon as needed.  However, as I look around all I see here are new faces.  That is a good thing.  Change is inevitable.  But with Kommisar soon stepping down from leading Dragon raids I cant help but think this is finally time for the Old Guard to leave completly.  It is time for those of us who have been here since the start to quietly hand the reigns on over to the new comers.  There are many new guilds and faces here who are undoubtly waiting for their chances to lead.  As long as I and Kommisar stay, however, I dont think that they will step forward.  <br><br>It is time for new people to step forward to help give back some of what they have gained from participating in KCoG.  It is time for new people with fresh ideas of where KCoG should go to step forward and lead.  Many of us older players are simply getting worn out and the road before us has become too narrow and straight to allow for new things.  It is time for me to step down gracefully and allow others a chance to do things their way instead of my way.<br><br>And so the field will be open.  Someone new will take over the Dragon Raids and someone else will take over the Planar Raids.  They can be the same person or guild, but regardless it will be new and that is good.  When you are ready to begin to run planar raids I will be available to help you.  But make no mistake, you will be in charge.  I will only be there to help advise and consult.  You will be able to make your own mistakes and your own successes.<br><br>For all things there is a first time.  I wish everyone success in whatever they choose to do in the future.  I salute those who have come before me, Harbringers, Zellex, Silver Daggers, Cassia, Dogedme, Pippi, Rbeka, Haemish, Fellowship of Faydark, Lagdalen and Flarren, Talovar, and Kommisar.  All too many of you have only become memories.  But I will remember as will KCoG.  And I salute those who will come after us.  Its not a burden that you pick up, but rather an opportunity to learn and to experience.  You will pull your hair out in fustration, you will experience wipeouts and angry tells.  But you will also see brand new zones, new mobs and items, you will succeed beyond your wildest dreams so long as you believe in those who are following you.<br><br>May you win every battle and may the mobs you want always spawn.<br><br>Kellory Silverstar<br>KCoG Plane Raid Liason<br>Tuesday, October 2, 2001 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxalos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xalos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Companion</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/2/01 12:56:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=209.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I believe that is it time for a change of the guard...</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the hard work and good times you've brought to the CoG and good luck on the path that lies before you.<br><br><br>Xalos aka Aurella <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ualthalonas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Althalonas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord of the Mist</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/2/01 6:30:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=209.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.gordyhand.co.uk/images/chris/face.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I believe that is it time for a change of the guard...</span><hr size=1> /salute Kellory<br><br>I know how hard running these raid must have been for you with no guild to back you up and have always tried to help out when I could. <br>You have done a great job and I have enjoyed raiding with you alot.<br><br>Good luck to who ever steps up to the plate this is an amazing opertunity for anyone.

For he had no support system, no guild to call on for help. It is a testament to his tenacity, and skills as a raid leader and a person that the CoG has had such success with the raids he's led.
