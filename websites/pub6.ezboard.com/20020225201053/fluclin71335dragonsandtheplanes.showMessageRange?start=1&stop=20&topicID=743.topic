Both are both Epic Related. In the case of Vox she needs to die as often as possible to have as many chances as possible for people to collect her very rare epic items. Naggy already gets busted very soon after he pops due to Clerics needing him dead. It has not been an issue to my knowledge and infact many people get to attend these raids. The change to a Lvl 52 limit really keeps the uber guilds from killing them all the time. The only real drawback is not being able to plan a Vox or Naggy raid in advance however there are plenty of times that Vox is up and no one is killing. <p>Troy Daedagor <BR> 55 Levels of Almost Always Having a Heal Memed <BR> <a href="http://www.gloriousrising.com"><img src="http://www.gloriousrising.com/forum_pics/signature_officer.jpg" width="200" height="45" border="0"></a><BR>   I'm a Templar?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uuladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uladar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=13173192&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Eater of PoC CoRNz </span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 11:04:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !@</span><hr size=1> I 100% disagree with Synique.  Lets use Venril Sathir in our example here.  Venril Sathir is a 3 day spawn.  Your reservation is a wednesday.  Venril Sathir spawns on a Tuesday.  EVERYONE wants to kill Venril Sathir.  Lets say we are a huggly server where there is peace and joy and Chakan dances in fields of flowers with Large.  Your reservation gets honored and no one touches him.  Now Tuesday night there is an emergency patch to fix the problem where the Monk epic can be obtained by a level 3 by combining a fire beetle eye in the oven.  Oh crap, we just wasted a spawn for a NPC that would have been taken out a few hours within his spawn time.  But no, your reservation just wasted a spawn.  Venril Sathir can be taken down in a grand total of 30 mins.  If you cannot organize a raid on a weekday that will take at most one hour of people's time, then you should not be putting a rare spawn on the calender.  <br><br>Now lets move this to Vox.  Vox is only killable by groups of people that are not greater than level 52.  Because of this level restriction there is ZERO competition for said mob.  I would be shocked all to hell if Vox was dropped more than 3 times a month.  Therefore why put something on the calender that maybe 2 groups tops would be competing for.  Can't you just talk to them and work something out?<br><br>Now lets talk about the Dain.  Currently only LoS has been successful on killing the Dain.  I personally feel that no other guild is ready for an attempt at this time.  Endorean was ready, but after our reorganization we are a little down from our highest point.  There will become a time when we are ready to drop the Dain.  I know that once the time comes we are ready we will work something out with LoS.<br><br>All the calender does for rare spawns is waste spawns, and waste people's time.  We know what group of people are killing any given mob.  Why is it so hard to talk to those groups of people?  The calender is not the end all system that is going to have us holding hands dancing around the may pole people.  It is great for its given purpose.  Letting the 100 other groups that are capable of doing planes raids know that you are going to be in that given plane for that day.<br><br>That is all. <p><font color="green" size=+1 face="Arial">Outrider Uladar</a></Font><BR><font size=-1 face="Comic Sans MS" color="Navy"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucayleustarshine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cayleu Starshine</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 11:21:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !@</span><hr size=1> For the exact reasons posted above, things like Dragons, VS, etc should not be on the calander. A few things will have an orderly rotation which is private among those few guilds able to do the kill, but aside from that, if you reserve something for saturday, and it pops thursday, if no one cares about it, fine life goes on. If it is a highly-competitive creature like Nagafen, you have got to move your raid up. Even if a patch didnt happen to waste a spawn, if you string together 3 or 4 of these 1-2 day delays, there's your wasted spawn right there.<br><br>If you want to do a raid where youll be able to set a date and raid on that day regardless of what happens, then pick a less-desired target like Vox, and if someone else expresses an interest in also killing Vox (for example), work it out with them. If your target is something highly-desired where the server doesnt want wasted spawns like Nagafen, you should go in realizing that you will probably need to be capable of moving your raid up if you have to.<br><br>Anyway, of bish's suggestions, I would only add Chardok Royals for now, and perhaps ToV/VP someday in the future. (though a private arrangement/agreement among guilds will probably work better for this, since I do not forsee massive competition for those places) The Chardok Royals is not sharable, there is a higher than normal desire to raid this place, it's a big all-evening affair, and it does not depend on a wierd weeklong or 3-day random spawn. That's pretty much a definition of why planes are reserved. <p>Cayleu Starshine<br><font color = blue>Healer of Tunare</font><br><font color=red>Insidious Blood</font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uveladorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veladorn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 498<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/14/01 6:52:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://yourpage.blazenet.net/anabelle/triad/valasclose2.jpg width=150 hieght=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !@</span><hr size=1> Bish, is there anyway you can force people to enter either a guild name or open?

Anything that has a long spawn time should be able to be reserved.  However I also acknowledge the epic issue.  If a mob spawns early then the person (or guild in his/her absense) should be notified and they NEED to organize a raid to take down that mob asap!  To say that spawns like Nagafen and Vox cannot be reserved is ABSURD!  If DOES favor larger guilds that can put together a raid on a moments notice.  Sorry, but everyone is entitled to dragon loot and epic pieces.  However if people start saying, &quot;Hey Naggy's up... let's kill him&quot; without any respect to the people organizing raids... it would be completely unfair.  It seems to me that too many higher level people and larger guilds are ignoring the fact that level 1 characters and guilds with 10 people in them still all pay the same $10 a month, and are entitled to the same opportunities.  Seems like everyone is overly worried about their loot and not about keeping the respect between everyone on the server.<br><br>I do agree however, that if special spawns are up for a respectable time without the scheduled party coming to kill them, then they should be taken down by the first person/guild able to do so.<br><br>Just my opinion, and I'm sure some will disagree <p>Nyatese Nivaro<BR>52 Wanderer of Luclin<BR>The Stryngs of Ayre<BR><BR>Cauldarin<BR>21 Cleric of Tunare<BR>The Stryngs of Ayre<BR><BR>Master Brewer (130), Baker (135), and Potter (131)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubishoopugget.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bishoopugget</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=57685510&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 405<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/15/01 6:49:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://everquest.estoncom.com/images/bishnut.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: As seen on the main calendar (changes)</span><hr size=1> We're not discussing whether or not mobs are 'reservable'.

The reservation system has worked great for a long time.  People were patient about the dragon spawns, and raids were always efficient and done with cooperation with other players on the server.<br><br>However you make Naggy/Vox FFA you will make this server filled with people who will step on each others toes to do their epics.  They are rare spawns, they shouldn't be contested with by other players.  Its not fair to those (Sharia for example) who have been trying to get their books for months, and other players who are ready to attempt to go for them and the scales for the bard/warrior epics.  It makes me feel like there are some people on this server who are getting greedy and cant wait a week or two for their shot at the dragons.  <br><br>Look at clerics?  How long is the wait for Ragefire?  Three months?  I havent even SIGNED up for the list yet, just in case my turn comes up and I am not to that part of the quest for the cleric epic yet.  It wouldnt be fair to the guy or gal behind me who IS ready to do that part of the quest.  I dont plan on getting my epic til at least this fall, probably later.  Epic quests are supposed to take a long time, they cant be done in a week, or a month.<br><br>As for Nagafens loot...yes it is nice.  I agree there, but think about it...lots of warriors out there can live without the CoF.  Many do.  All his loot is very nice, and everyone who pays 10$ a month to play EQ should get a shotat it when they sign up for a dragon raid.  Doing this means that some guilds will have the power to basically farm Naggy and Vox and will create a glass wall for some people on this server who want to do their epics or get a shot at some nice items.<br><br>So, yes I am against making the dragons FFA.  Its only going to cause all the players on this server hardship.  Some people seem to think only of themselves though.

Vox, Naggy, Gore, etc, doesn't matter.<br><br>Yeah, killing them faster means more will pop.  But put bluntly, that also denies as many people their chance at what they need as it does opens up for others.  That's great, dragon dies every Wednesday for four months straight.  Some people have work in the morning, and CAN'T stay up like that, hence the concept of weekend raids.<br><br>I'm not one of those.  I own my own business, can generally stay up as long as I like.  But I still don't like the idea of doing something like this.  One of my main servers used to be Mithaniel Marr.  Mith Marr at one point had a reservation system of sorts.  It was a very pleasant server to be on at that time.  Mith Marr is also now totally FFA.  It's not a server worth playing on unless you join an uberguild, if you have any aspirations towards an epic that has a contended spawn.  The uberguilds have hordes of twinks that kill Vox and Nagafen most pops, and the other dragons are killed upon popping, generally.  Veeshan is in the same boat, as are several other servers.<br><br>So will making the dragons go FFA really mean that many fewer dragon kills?  Not really, no.  Patches have been far in-between lately, and with Shadows of Luclin coming out I'd say they'll stay that way.

This has nothing to do with FFA.<br><br>This has to do with the following question.  Does the calendar serve its intended purpose when it comes to 7 day spawns?<br><br>Tell me, when you post a &quot;reservation&quot; on the calendar for a dragon, does that do *anything* to ensure that you will get to attempt that dragon that day?  No, absolutely nothing.  In fact, there's approximately a 14% chance that the dragon will even be there if the dragons are killed on a regular basis and you aren't lucky enough to post on a patch day.<br><br>When you use a list to reserve long spawn time mobs, when you are on the top of the list you get the next spawn, very simple.  No more posting 15 times over two months to try to make sure you get at least a couple dragon kills.<br><br>Please, don't convince me what the calendar does and doesn't do, I created the thing in the first place.<br><br>4 Vox reservations in one week?  WHY???  She only spawns once (barring patches) a week!<br><br>Where's the list?  I don't know, why doesn't someone make one?  Am I supposed to make it even though I have little desire to raid old world dragons?  Many months ago I thought that a graphical calendar would be much easier to read than the clutter on the dragons and planes board.  You know what I did?  I made a calendar, showed it around, got some support, and most people started using it.<br><br>If you can give me a simple, straight forward reason as to why throwing darts at the calendar and hoping to pick the right day a dragon is up is better than using list reservation for the dragons, sure, I will reopen the discussion about whether they belong on the calendar.  A discussion, by the way, that the majority of us had many months ago and came to a agreement that, at the time, was uncontested.<br><br>I apologize for being grumpy, but it seems that I'm getting arguements on things that don't really have to do with the subject or am being contradicted by people that either haven't read everything I've written or haven't researched any of the discussions we've had about these subjects for the last year.<br><br>I run a calendar for all of you that I don't even use.  I run it out of respect for this server and for my friends.  I would wholly appreciate the respect of fully reading what I'm saying before arguing and making points that have little to nothing to do with the current proposal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=743.topic&start=21&stop=36>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=743.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=743.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=21><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/es/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=743.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.threadControl?topicID=743.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/es/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=743.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=743.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes>Dragons and the Planes</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
