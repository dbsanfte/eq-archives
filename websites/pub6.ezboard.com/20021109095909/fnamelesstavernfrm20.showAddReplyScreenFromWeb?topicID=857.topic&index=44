I went to school for music and alot of the musicians think that the electronic music is glorified computer programing and do not appriciate it for that reason.  <br>
<br>
I have yet to really listen to that genre with few exceptions (aphex twin...honestly mostly because of that &quot;come to daddy&quot;?? song) but I do realize that there is a certain talent for making that style of music.<br>
<br>
I listen to the music behind the singer more than the singer &lt;mostly the drums/percussion&gt;.  Most people..if they put their mind to it...could sing and a band can get by with average guitar players and bass players..but it takes alot of skill (IMO) to sit in the background of the stage and play the beat that keeps the music driving.  <br>
<br>
If a guitar player/bass player makes an error during the concert only the biggest fans of the band would notice and maybe not even then because they expect certain embelishments to the music.  No one expects the singer to be able to sing perfectly at show...they know they've been on tour for months before hand and have to reserve some energy for the rest of their tour.  If the drummer misses a beat, though...85% of the people will know because it has the chance to throw the entire song off.  <br>
<br>
Drummers are like the line men in football <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

**edit because I type slow**<br>
<br>
I misread the lyrics thinking he said he was in his car for some reason and I appologize, but drinking in public is illegal too =)<br>
<br>
I said I don't know what they sound like...<br>
<br>
They made 2 different bands<br>
<br>
they only released one album nationally, therefore the general population would only have acces to the songs put on that album to make a judgement on their sound.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukaeliic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaeliic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.necrognomicon.com/images/skullspin.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/28/02 2:42:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ureevexoberto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reevexoberto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>gentle</span><br>  Posts: 1818<br> <font color=#333333>(8/28/02 2:49:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://capngentle.homestead.com/files/sexyboy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CHOKING VICTIM</span><hr size=1> I view it more as art.<br>
<br>
Like, producing EXACTLY what is coming from the artists mind onto his canvas, i.e. pro-tools, what have you.<br>
<br>
In essence, yes, it is glorified computer programming, but not everyone can do it as well as others.<br>
<br>
btw the aphex twin thing, most of the only things people have heard from him is Come to Daddy or Windowlicker. What most people don't realize is that he made come to daddy as satire to stuff like Firestarter by Prodigy. Aphex Twin actually has said in interviews that he made Windowlicker as a &quot;pop song&quot; to appeal to mass audiences.<br>
<br>
If you want to hear real Aphex Twin check out the songs Fingerbib, Alberto Balsam, or On.<br>
<br>
<br>
p.s. most anything by Squarepusher makes Aphex Twin look like an amateur <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ureevexoberto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reevexoberto</A> at: 8/28/02 2:51:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukaeliic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaeliic</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.necrognomicon.com/images/skullspin.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#333333>(8/28/02 2:55:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/kaeliic2/images/devil.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CHOKING VICTIM</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and that is a good way to view it...and yes there are a select few who do it better than others (just like with any other style of music)<br>

<br>
No, dude, bands like this dont exist to try and spread ideas.  They exist to push themselves into a &quot;fly scene&quot; of what reevex described as kids who's parents pay for their stupid shredded ass clothes.  Most underground booking agency's wouldn't even book these lard buckets of sound shit, simply because it falls in the lines of skinhead nazi oi bands.<br>
<br>
Bands who try to be blatantly offensive, and base their thoughts solely off the thought of being an &quot;outcast&quot;.  The only bands to have successfully prove a point in the world today are(pardon me for leaving out a few):<br>
<br>
Conflict(they're the base of your stupid fucking anarchist movement)<br>
Rage agains the machine(spread of socialist values)<br>
Fugazi(how to put your foot up corporate america's ass and give em the finger and keep selling records)<br>
Minor Threat(Straight Edge drug free punks)<br>
Elvis(more of a sexual freedom expression)<br>
Grateful Dead(Musical freedom music piracy is OK)<br>
Ramones and all the early punk bands that created the pure punk movement.<br>
Massive Attack members(have made one of the largest archives of electronic music).<br>
Bad Brains(black hardcore, purely amazing band, best hardcore band ever)<br>
GrandMaster Flash...........rap<br>
The classic dead people, no one cares about them though.<br>
Kiss/ozzy &amp; AC/DC(yes i hate them but i give them props for making ass rock and metal).<br>
Bauhaus(hello goths)<br>
Nirvana(heya grunge)<br>
and last but not least..........<br>
The Sex Pistols(combining euro rock to the US)<br>
<br>
The reason i dont go into the bands that affected the above bands to be so progressive(such as bands that affected Minor Threat, bob mould, TSOL, the virus, or anymore of the crusty bands, is simply because they didn't do anything &quot;spectacular&quot; like the above bands did.   They never affected the musical genres as much as the above bands did.  So before the next underground king of bling decides to bash my list above, see how much they &quot;truely&quot; affected the over all view of that musical genre.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes the radio is by far the most popular form of music.  But by far the radio is the smallest form of music.  Radio makes probaly less than 5% of all music playable.  Thus making 95% of the rest of the more different styles different genre's(insert your sub-catgories, ska-punk,punk, hardcore, ska-core,rapcore, shit shit and more shit).<br>
<br>
I will bash on radio music all i fucking want for 1 fucking reason......i hate fucking trendy people, and people who refuse to look for something different.<br>
<br>
I hate mudvayne, i hate kittie(they simply fucking suck and cant sell more than 100 tickets with 25$ tickets), i hate fucking durst, i hate fucking aguillera, spears.  All that dumb shit is stupid.  I hate most ska bands for the most part.  The only ones that have ever kept it real are RBF, The toasters, LTJ.  Compare 2002 to 1996 when all those dumbasses were touring.  /wave ska.<br>
<br>
I hate marilyn manson, i hate all that dumb shit, that stupid fucking new emo shit, it's all stupid.<br>
<br>
I do like some radio bands i'll admit, i like jimmy eat world(they keep their home scene very real and in their lives), New Found Glory(will always be special because shai hulud is still around), Hatebreed(i'll always be a fan of the CT HC scene), and anything Wes Borland touches is amazing.  Papa Roach is cool too.<br>
<br>
Those people in those bands are the truest people.  Fred Durst yaps his fucking cocksucker off about how New York this New York that.  But i remember limp bizkit like 6-7 years ago(touring with a band called noizome groove who was mediocre as was limp bizkit pre-3 dolla bill), saying that they were from florida?  How fucking lame is that.  Pick your home scene and stick to your home scene. <br>
<br>
If you want to hear about most new york musicians opinions, listen to buddha from blood for blood.<br>
<br>
Listen to what you like but most of these durst funded retards, Conflict &quot;inspired&quot; &quot;punk bands&quot;, just do it to look different.  People can like it all they want, but you shouldn't blare the fucking shit spewing from dursts proverbial shithole of a mouth in your sporty SUV.  When the person next to you probaly bought their 1982 subaru with their own money.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, Radio sucks, it always has sucked, and radio bands dont fucking credit the founders of their genre, and dont support it enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;If i cant dance to it, it's not my revolution - Emma Goldblum.&quot;<br>
<br>
You dont fucking mix korn, and aguillera, and durst on a stage and expect everyone to be happy with that.  I'm a hardcore fan, why the fuck would i wanna see my favorite band hopesfall(for bout 4 years now) get large sell a shitload of records.  And then have to go to their show and have to wait for fucking 3 shitty ass rapcore bands to play before i get to watch hopesfall.  More than likely i'm going to skip all 3 bands and pay to enter when hopesfall starts setting up.  Or else i'm not going to go period.<br>
<br>
In often cases, sam doesn't go......i refuse to go to most of my old favorite bands shows because it's a moral delimma on paying money to see the rapcore bullshit that opens up for them, and it's utterly disgusting music.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok done bitching<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

PS, fuck injected, fuck shitty ass kitty, fuck The Juliana theory for being one of the worst live bands, Fuck deicide, and fuck all the trendy fuckers that call themself &quot;hardcore&quot; when all they are, are crap rappers.<br>

No, dude.. were not talkin about Blink 182, and as far as the skinhead nazi oi shit, I have no idea where you got that from.  CV/LOC is very much against racism, sexism, and homophobes.  Also, theyre always booked in the little shit hole clubs, no main stream get ups for these boys.  <br>
<br>
And as far as the rest of your post, i think i agree with most said, it was kinda jumbled and confusing, but I would like to make one thing clear: Sex Pistols=Backstreet Boys/N'SYNC of Punk Rock, they were put together to sell records.  They had nothing to say, they were in for the shock factor and thats all they did.  <br>

They fucking suck compared to Op Ivy.  Op Ivy had their last show in 89 i believe. <br>
<br>
Blood for Blood is from Boston, so why would anyone ask the singer (Buddha) about the NYC scene?  Speaking of New York, I saw Choking Victim there in 95 at ABC No Rio.  They were pretty enjoyable, and already had an album or two out at that time.  Cant comment on their lyrics/message though.<br>
<br>
Earth Crisis are from Syracuse, not NYC.  They're not at all considered a NYC band.  If you want to hear real NYC hardcore listen to 25 Ta Life.<br>
<br>
Conflict were good, but I prefer Crass myself. Penis Envy is a fucking amazing record lyrically.  Probably the most scathing social-political commentary put to vinyl, ever.<br>
<br>
Bad Brains were indeed incredible in their heyday.  4 black rasta dudes from DC, with 10x more talent than every other hardcore band before or since. Absolutely phenomenal once, but have kinda burned out over the last 10 years.  Rock for Light is one of the best records ever for true~<br>
<br>
Ahh the memories...<br>

Political bands sell shows like nazi skinhead bands is what i was trying to say.  No one wants to go to some preachy ass concert.  ESpecially one who goes out of their way to purposely annoyingly stupid with stupid religous symbol gimmicks.  And gimmicks in general that have no relationship to music.<br>
<br>
Hence why i stick away from the whole religous symbol bullshit.  If you want to do something progressive and mind changing.  Be original, dont just be the next zit infested maggot 16 yr old who listened to anarchy bands for the past hour and goes into the show to make an ass out of himself.<br>
<br>
Crust punks are about as popular as abecrombie and fitch these days...........what happened to the ones who used to be the diehards.<br>
