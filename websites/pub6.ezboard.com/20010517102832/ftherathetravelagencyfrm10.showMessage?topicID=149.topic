Fear Became ours at 2 am PST by all rights andd CT was still up We bent over backwards to accomadate BOD on the epic loots from CT but 3 times they Broke their word and on the last thing they were agfreed to Give ROS all GOD loot from CT and only take the  epic loot since it technically was our plane at the time and 3 attempts on CT had been made. This agreement stipulated that ROS LOOK at the god corpse B4 any BOD looted so that we could verify ALL god(nonepic) loot went to ROS and again BOD didnt stick to the deal and Looted CT B4 we could verify the loot so we have NO WAY of knowing what actually dropped all we have is BOD's word and i think its safe to say that their word aint worth the air used to speak it.<br>
I wanna KNOW why you were in our plane on OUR day and stayed after being asked to leave 3 times.<br>
<br>
I also wanna know why you didnt stick to the deal you made.<br>
<br>
It is my understanding that BB guilds are to HELP guilds like PM when needed but 6 PM in a plane and over 30 BOD is not helping it is takeing over to get extra planer dates which is what you (and others) accused the calander of doing  in the first place.<br>
<br>
I hope vigoe destroying the sould leech at least pissed some of you off.<br>
<br>
I also wanna know why my guildies were insulted for asking you to leave which was by far within our rights at the time?<br>
<br>
I have little or no respect for BOD/BOTS any more  after this and i will not deal with them as a guild in any other way than with extreame suspicion.<br>
<br>
I fully hope that some sanctions will be taken against this flagrent  disreguard for the system we have in place.<br>
<br>
BOD should be suspended from BB status for a set period or at the least lose their next planer dates as a punishment.<br>
<br>
I by no means speak for my entire guild but in my opinion BOD you screwed us and that pisses me off.<br>

<br>
I believe we (bod) looted<br>
<br>
1 carmine pants - no wiz's there<br>
1 blighted boots - necro there willingly offered<br>
1 shishar head - bb<br>
<br>
all other loot was give to other guild(s) including draco / ct, as well as a soul leech or whatever its called, ninja'd.<br>
<br>
bb began at near midnight, with at least a 1.5 hour CR.<br>
<br>
I have seen keg big brothering till 7am in fear on more than one occation.<br>
<br>
I dont understand the inconsistency in calling out bod for bbing late but not keg?<br>
<br>
BBing almost ALWAYS starts extremley LATE, because its when a raid goes BAD... = you went to fear / hate, and you had some trouble, usually tried a cr, and etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
BBing is about killing gods promplty - ie having them dead asap, at 5am, when then next guild came on, i strongly doubt that the 6-7 persons on could have killed CT, he would have remained up till the next evening, thus allowing him to live longer, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
From the outcome, us killing ct, handing over ALL items, killing shissar.  It shows that that is ALL we were there for (and ct skin, which, btw is a myth).<br>
<br>
This is not a fight post, this is simply showing that we followed the spirit of BB - we came to fear, we CR'd its took MASSIVELY longer than we expected, but we still got it done, and by the rules, handed over all loot.  By following the letter of the 2am rule, we would have broken the spirit of the BB rule. ( you gotta see that...??? please see that) - that is: kill ct/inny as OFTEN as possible, as SOON as possible to allow for a larger net of god spawns per unit time!<br>

<br>
PM (Post Mortem) apparently did not call in BoD, early on in their raid, who may have been up for Epic rotation on the Saturday. And as in most cases when a BB is called in the raid for PM seems to have taken a bit longer than 2am PST.<br>
Did PM or BoD contact each other and have open communication? Only PM/BoD could answer that.<br>
<br>
RoS deffinetly has enough to clean CT out, that's not in question. The question should be why didn't PM call in the BB for that day earlier on if they knew they would not be able to kill CT/Draco?<br>
<br>
I could see BoD at fault in the current situation if it was something like:<br>
BoD zoned in at 2am PST and started clearing Fear as it was repopping for the RoS raid at 8am EST.<br>
<br>
But that does not appear to be what happened..<br>
<br>
Does anyone have a link for Post Mortem's site?<br>
<br>
Does PM meet the current requirements for posting, and knows where this board is located? *ponder*<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: Was BoD called in late to BB for PM who didn't realize they had no chance 3-4 hours into their raid to do CT/Draco?<br>
<br>
It would appear that they were called in near the end of PM's raid, what does PM have to say about this?<br>
<br>
EDIT: Did BoD break any of the calendar rules?<br>
<br>
According to Emil their raid went later than expected and they cut into the 2am PST mark, but how many BB guilds have been able to clear Fear within an hour or so with CT/Draco up and being called late to assist the guild currently in the plane?<br>
So, no, it does not appear they broke any of the calendar guidelines.<br>

That is the only way that will satisfy all party involved. Obviously you need to arrange that before the kill and warn the people about it to prevent any &quot;accident&quot; from hapening.<br>
<br>
Emil I think this isn't a black and white case, ask yourself this : If KEG would of been called to BB and you would have fear the next day how would you have tolerated KEG presence there past 2 am pst ? That should give you a good insight on how RoS is feeling...<br>
<br>
Can it be that the BBs rules needs to be a bit more precise to prevent cases like this ? Just asking...<br>

<br>
I honestly dont feel we were, as we looted nothing (but rots).<br>
<br>
On the scenario, if Keg was there, and 99% ready to kill ct, and they were past the 2am rule, i really woudnt care.<br>
<br>
My belief on the 2am rule is to prevent farming repops, not curtailling a BB endeavor.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthorfinnwayforger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorfinn Wayforger</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Wog</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>31</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12/19/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>9:27:23 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: BOD,PM,TINDI and ROS in fear</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I just have one question here. Which is more important, the &quot;Spirit of hte BB calendar&quot;, or the &quot;Spirit of the calendar system&quot;? When they come into conflict, which should win? To me it's obvious. Since the BB system is an add on to the regular calendar, the regular calendar should always win. Sure, if a BB is called in late, and they stay late, normally it's not a problem, Like if they're there til 4AM, and the next raid isn't scheduled to start til say, 3PM, there's not much conflict there. However, in this case, BoD was in Fear, killing mobs, until 7am PST. The RoS raid was scheduled to start 3 hours later. We logged on, set groups up, and saat on our asses wiating for repops. I don't know about everyone else, but for me at least, it's not about the damn loot. It's about having fun with my friends. We had 40-50 people in Fear, waiting for repops instead of having a fun raid, because BoD stayed so much later than a raid is normally allowed to go.<br>
<br>
Yes, PM should have called in a BB. Yes, that BB then has the right to &quot;help&quot;. But, when does that end? at 2am PST, technically, the raid stopped being a Pm raid, and started being a RoS raid, by the calendar rules. Sure, staying later for CR is obviously fine. But, when asked to leave, so the RoS raid can go through as planned, is the proper response &quot;Fuck RoS!&quot;? (Yes, that's a quote). Or, how about &quot;We didn't agree to any 2AM deadline, go to hell!&quot;?<br>
<br>
Then making a &quot;deal&quot; to have a shot at Cazic, then to leave, win or lose. Losing. Staying anyway. Making a NEW deal, to have one more shot at Cazic, then to leave, win or lose. Losing again. Staying anyway. See where this is going?<br>
<br>
Now, it was said earlier in this thread that other BB guilds have also stayed very late. I can't comment on this, as I was not there. However, this time, it was RoS on the recieving end, so I CAN comment here. And, I'm sorry, but I feel calendar rules WERE violated. The calendar is here to allow groups to have uninterrupted raids, in a clean plane. That is it's base purpose. This purpose was, in fact, violated. Now, the question is... what's to be done about it? At the very least, I believe the rules need more definition...</font><P>The Forger of the Way<BR>

There is a reason why many people dont trust BoD, they should know that already, and understand that if there is an agreement for BoD NOT to loot CT if they get the kill then they should have kept their agreement. We all know even BoD is crazy about those carmine robes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Asking for BoD to leave after they helped with CR having the God up is wrong.  They helped, they wanted their reward, and that is totally understandable.  <br>
<br>
However having the BB there loot for you shouldn't have happened.</font><P>Sultar McWeiser<br>
