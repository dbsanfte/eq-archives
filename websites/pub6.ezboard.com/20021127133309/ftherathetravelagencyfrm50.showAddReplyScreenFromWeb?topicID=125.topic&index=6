I know it, personally, which is one of the reasons I am as vocal over and at anyone who tries to d!ck with the rotations, or suggest that the way the RTA works is geared to the ubers. <br>

Anyone with ANY motivated self-interest that does not understand the differance between the rathe, and the FFA servers, is an idiot. <br>

Anyone who feels that they would be getting *more* on a FFA server, unless they wear the tag of one of the three (two) biggest guilds on the server, are dilusional. <br>

This Earth got set under the eyes of the Nameless, under the stars, so it could watch over his cosmos.<br>
<br>
It is an excerpt from the recent GM event in which a male, or female story teller goes about telling the story of how the EQ universe was created. IMO it is a lead up to PoP, can't see any other reason for them to actually staple some content into EQ, and give us a real history for roleplay. <br>
<br>
For easy viewing, here is a transcript of the event.<br>
<br>
Today I am telling you the Story about how Norrath got created<br>
<br>
In the beginning, all that existed was void. Empty of all, whether it be time or space. A vast and endless nothingness cloaked in a deep and all consuming silence. <br>
<br>
Within this void existed &quot;The Nameless&quot;, a power so incredible that in the entire universe, it knew only itself to exist. It had no idea why it was there, just that that it was. <br>
<br>
In the quiet expanse of the void, it sent itself out and searched the void to find something different. And there it was, a pocket of space and therein lay the flow of time. When The Nameless stepped into the space, something terrible but wonderful, something terrifying but exciting happened. It detected the elements of space and time. The Nameless, knowing nothing of these things, freed what was in there so it could spread out in all directions, filling the space that had been empty for so long with a force that had no boundaries.<br>
<br>
Forces touched each other and the emptiness filled with swirling energies, light and heat touched emptiness. Energies collided and crashed, were born and died and became new and different  ... none of those having been seen ever before started to form planets that differed in size and structure. Also created were stars to watch over this new creation. <br>
<br>
But the whole chaos needed order, shaping and fine touch. And so the Nameless created The Gods of Power. To do so, The Nameless reached into the chaos, drew forth four equal portions of the stuff of existence and shaped it into the Gods that would divide the universe into form.<br>
<br>
The first was named Rathe and got the task of bringing order into the chaos. It saw that the task was indeed immense, so it reached into itself and divided into 12 equal parts.   Then The Rathe went into the chaos divided some more material and created Earth. This Earth got set under the eyes of the Nameless, under the stars, so it could watch over his cosmos.<br>
<br>
The second was named Fennin Ro and received the task of shaping the chaos.<br>
<br>
Fennin as well drew his portion and named it Fire. He then placed it upon the stars to shed light on the cosmos. Fennin Ro helped The Rathe to shape the solid matter and gave warmth to the cold of chaos.<br>
<br>
The third was named Water and The Nameless determined it would need many forms. So it took the portion and split it into three. Tarew Marr would be responsible for the main state of the element, the Water, E'Ci for the solid state; the Ice and Povar would lord over steam. These three took their portion and cloaked each world with its life giving touch.<br>
<br>
And finally the fourth was named Xegony and she received the task of drawing away the material in-between and setting each thing in its place.  She used her portion of chaos to make it into Air, which she used to blow the chaos away and cushion each world from the harshness of the cold cosmos. <br>
<br>
The Nameless then looked into its new creation and felt sorrow because it could not experience it, for the creation could not contain the Nameless and so it decided to find a way to explore this new existence.<br>
<br>
So the Nameless called out to the Gods of Power and commanded them to make minions that it could share in their experience of this new world. Each of the Gods of Power reached into their elemental planes and drew forth a portion that they shaped with their will into what would be eyes and hands for The Nameless and themselves. They created beings of energy, much like themselves, but beings of will born of the matter of the cosmos. The Gods of Power knew that balance must be maintained in the universe to keep its shape. Therefore they started to create the Gods of Influence in the model of a scale, on one side a force of darkness or destruction, on the other side a force of light or creation and ... in the middle, a neutral or balancing force to maintain the balance without the involvement of the Gods of Power.<br>
<br>
And so they combined their elements to create each God in turn, good, neutral and evil, which the children of Norrath may choose to follow until the end of times.<br>
<br>
Pretty good, but if I had written it, there would be a lot more razzle dazzle, flashy lights, and definetely at least one robot. <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif"</img> <br>

Back up untill llast year there was an EQ site dedicated to it with all sorts of storys , like this one. I printed out the entire site. If there is any interest in this from others i could break out my scanner and scan it all back onto my computer. <br>
  It tells the tales of the creation of the God of Power, Gods of Influence, Age of Sacel, Elder Age , the Birth of the Iskar nation, how the Trolls first came to arrive on Antonica and were 1st seen and befriended by the Ogres etc.. its like 30 pages of various historys. <br>
  If anyone was interested i could submit it for a *sticky* link. Or i could bribe my son to come over and finally walk me through settin up my personal web page i can host it on for those interested to link to.<br>

<br>
Personally I'd love to help however I don't have the funds to just give out, but I'd like to offer my help. Currently I pay for a domain name and web server for my web pages. In my search to move away from ezboard I discovered Ikonboard. Now on my server I host not only my guilds message board, one of our allies boards but also our alliance message board. I have plenty of room, server has been pretty stable and would like to offer services to host an RTA board at no cost. The way I look at it I have the space and room so I don't mind helping out.<br>

You would be able to do a lot more customization than the options given by Ezboard. You have different teir levels that can be set for member access, sub directories and a few other additions. Overall in my opinion it is more user friendly than ezboard. The downside is that everyone would have to register which is something to consider since a lot of major guilds use ezboard so they just keep themselves logged in. There are none nor will there ever be pop ups. I'd be even willing in my spare time to design an official webpage.<br>
<br>
Here are some boards that I currently host:<br>
ProtoCultureX Nexus - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.protoculturex.com/forum">www.protoculturex.com/forum</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Steel Talons of Rathe - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.protoculturex.com/steeltalons/forum">www.protoculturex.com/steeltalons/forum</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

I don't think I could hang for long in that type of situation because the frustration and bitter inter-guild fighting would have me throwing my computer out my window and on to the interstate.<br>
<br>
My guild, Far Seekers, has benefited GREATLY because of the forethought of the Tier 1 guilds in creating the rotation guidelines.  Because of the rotations and guidelines we have been able to start growing our guild and increasing the enjoyment of our members.  Not only do Tier 1 guilds still recognize these rotations, but they sometimes actively let smaller guilds have shots at rotation mobs so they can also get on rotations.  I find that amazing and completely unselfish to the extreme.<br>
<br>
This member of a Mid-Tier (Maybe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) guild is deeply grateful that the higher Tier guilds remember what it was like to be in our situation.  Remembering the excitement and joy that comes from killing your first Rotation mob.  Remembering the first time your guild was able to kill all three Golems in Fear.  Remembering when your guild was finally strong enough to try HoT.  These are the acheivements that keep the game new and fun.  And without them - what do you have???  xp grinding.  Fun..fun..pfft<br>
<br>
I would like to thank the officers and members of the high-end guilds for not forgetting their past and letting the up and coming guilds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  have their shot at experiencing the 'True Fun' of EQ.<br>
<br>
/Salute!<br>
<br>
Because if everything was FFA - We wouldn't have had a shot at it.<br>
<br>
I only ask that you take our suggestions and questions with an open mind. (this is not to suggest that you already haven't)  I would hope that all the Mid-Tier guilds will pose their suggestions with respect to those guilds that have worked HARD to make things a level playing field. I would also hope that those high-end guilds will answer and think about our questions and suggestions with that same respect.<br>
<br>
Mid-Tier guilds do need to remember that these rotations benefit us MUCH MORE than the high-end guilds.<br>
