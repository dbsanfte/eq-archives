<br>
Trompen WAS in Skyfire when Ragefire spawned. He has been in Skyfire every minute the servers have been up for at least the last week. He may have been AFK but does that mean he gives up his mob after days of camping??<br>
<br>
If the list is recognized or not is still an ongoing debate, but isnt really relavent seeing the Trompen has been camping Ragefire for at least a week and was in zone when he spawned.<br>
<br>
CoN did call on NB for assistance because we have a large number of people that are not available to help at the time he spawned. Many of your members were nice enough to respond and offer their assistance, rather than come to Skyfire and kill Ragefire for themselves, as SoT was so inclined to do.<br>
<br>
It is obvious that what is done is done. Unfortunately Trompen will have to continue on his nightmare camp and hope for the best. There is nothing that anyone can do to change the facts. But hopefully this will show all of The Rathe just how low some people will go, not that SoT gives a rat's ass!  <p><br><hr size="1" width="100%">

(to try to hold a camp w/o anyone being there).<br>
<br>
afaik, there is no written rotation on ragefire, its just agreed to not 'back to back' kill him, and to respect camps (camp was, in solb defined as a grp that can kill the Fg's present - camp in SF is not defined; however, at least ONE person present minimum would constitute a camp in SF).<br>
<br>
Again, i do not know details, but if he was up for 5 hours, even 1 hour (imo) with no one there then i dont think sot was in the wrong (particularly if they were actually trying to make contact with con people), as per the agreement on rage (unless sot did a back to back kill).<br>

I don't know the details, but can only assume by what others have written. <br>
<br>
I know that at 5am, or hell, even 4pm (now) Clan Bashemded only had 12 members online, but we have a cleric ready for rage. If he was up for 5 hours, that may well be because whatever guild was camping him didn't have the man power to put it together, at the time. This is not the FG in lower guk, this is not some non-important single drop mob that no one benefits from except the person that wins a random. This is the lynchpin of the undeniably MOST important epic in the game, to both the cleric, and his/her guild. <br>
<br>
Yes, a cleric AFK for 7 days, does not a camp make, but to not wait for a guild to gather enough of it's members online to engage? <br>
<br>
Can we please allow clerics some time to sleep? Or do we really think that they should be awake for all 120+ hours of the camp? (Keeping in mind that people start to get delusional after 72 hours with no sleep). <br>
<br>
Probably not the best public relations move that could have been made in this instance, that's for sure. <br>

I can't believe that any guild on this server would gank a ragefire. It makes me ill to think about it.<br>

When <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> we</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> camp Ragefire for a week solid, who will take it from us?<br>

Nice incentive to even start. Should any guild that isn't one of the biggest on the server even try for this epic? <br>

I can't imagine your fustration.  I read the numerous posts and I found Pulgrey's version most disturbing.  <br>
<br>
The SoT that were there saying they were just following guild leader orders is no excuse.  Do you guys have a Nazi mentality?  Following your guild leader in doing wrong does not excuse you from your own moral responsiblity in respecting others.  This is a game but it does remind me of past war criminals that said they were &quot;following orders&quot;.  All of us military members are trained in LOAC (Law of Armed Conflct).  Look it up and try to associate this with what took place.  There is such a thing called a &quot;lawful order&quot;.  Even in a time of war, if I ordered one of my troops to kill a non-combatant and he/she followed the order then he/she would be just as guilty as me.<br>
<br>
I just got back in the country last night and wasn't there so if the events according to Pulgrey are accurate, then those SoT involved are guilty of KSing.  From what I read, Trompen camped RF for a week to get shown how greedy people can be.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Trompen if you could use a SK to help you when RF pops, look me up and I will try my best to be there for you.<br>

<br>
If trompen was there and camping the mob, then I want to see the logs of his conversation with SoT while they staged to kill this Dragon.<br>
<br>
Because you can't tell me they could sneak in and kill him while the man actually Camping the mob was unaware.<br>
<br>
If Trompen was on AFK during normal work type hours then he sould have had someone else in the zone assisting him with the camp.<br>
<br>
If SoT knew that Trompen was in the zone and actively cmaping him and Still killed the Dragon - that is kill stealing.<br>
<br>
If Trompen was afk for mass hours then I am sorry but the camp does not belong to Trompen and SoT took advantage of an Unclaimed Dragon.<br>
<br>
The list you refer to here on these forums is not recognized by the majority of larger guilds on this server. <br>
<br>
There is no Ragefire list that KIC recognizes.<br>
<br>
And to place someone afk for mass hours is a little to much to ask anyone to accept.<br>
<br>
This is similar to an experiance I had in Kedge Keep recently where a Rogue in KIC in need of a Kedge robe for his epic went to KK and found it an empty zone. He called for help and we went down and killed Phin. It took roughly 30 to 45 minutes to get the folks down to Kedge, but we were in no hurry, we had 2 Bodies from KIC and 4 from another guild that had just zoned in to do the Druid epic as proof we had Phin.<br>
<br>
Just as we were about to pull Phin some lame assed wizard zones in and says he had been holding the camp for over 8 hours but was holding the camp while afk in Dagnors Cauldron.<br>
<br>
So of course I refused to recognize this Bullshit as a valid camp.<br>
<br>
Same thing applies here. If Trompen was there - even if he was alone and he claimed the camp then the unwritten code of conduct that 99% of this Server follows means the camp is Trompens.<br>
<br>
However if Trompen was simply AFK sitting there like SoT says &quot;For five hours&quot; and if SoT did in fact try to contact these clerics in the zone and got no response for the 5 hours they have spoken of, then I have to say that &quot;Grats SoT on your Ragefire kill.&quot; <p><b>Da Rok</b><br>

I will post on this matter though, because it has far reaching implications.  <br>
<br>
I see two camps of people here.  The first is trying to work together and find some way of solving VI's crap implementation of an epic quest.  They are attempting to avoid being hurtful and inconsiderate.  Even when they don't agree with the implementation, as Karadin stated, they refuse to stoop to the level that SoT has.  The second camp are the people who thumb their noses at trying to build a server community.  Unfortunately, most &quot;uber&quot; guilds are in the latter camp.  For those who may be offended by that stereotype, I am sorry you feel that way.  Stereotypes are often earned.  Uber guilds on the Rathe are collectively a sorry excuse for humanity.  Noble Blade is the exception to the rule, I am happy to say.  <br>
<br>
SoT, you have made many enemies today.  I will no longer associate with any of you (including those that have been on my friends list) that wear the SoT tag.  Furthermore, I will do whatever I can to encourage my friends to withhold any assistance at all.  I am a quiet type, but 3 years of playtime on one server does tend to build a group of friends, and I have a good reputation.<br>

I have read many different posts on this and am getting the feeling CoN was present and trying to raise the forces to kill this dragon when SoT basically swooped in and killed him.<br>
<br>
This is wrong.<br>
<br>
Yet again SoT shows their true colors...<br>

I don't know how long Trompen was AFK. I don't know how long Rage was up before SoT swooped in. <br>
<br>
I do know that there really isn't a rotation per se on Rage, just a gentlemen's agreement. I also know that Tromp has been camping Rage for about a week and a half.<br>
<br>
If everything happened exactly as SoT claimed, they didn't really jump a camp by server standards. That doesn't mean that what they did was any less lame or pathetic. It would only make slightly less assinine.<br>

We stayed with Ddoe for over 150 hours thru several unexpected patches so I know how you feel about waiting.<br>
I think we all need to stop and consider what are we willing to do to gain an item for a toon.  Everquest is SUPPOSED to be a game that teaches you things like HONOR, chivalry, and teamwork.  Obviously, some people have missed that part.<br>
I mourn for their loss too.  Irregardless of the time involved, if a cleric was at the spawn point, no one should have taken that mob from them.  I'm sorry, anyone can make excuses, but everyone knows what a horror story that camp is and to just move in and kill an epic mob is much below the level that I have known SoT to be.  On a related note, we should not blame anyone but those responsible for this deed.  I'm sure that not all the members of SoT were involved or had any knowledge of this action, most I know would have objected violently.<br>
In the end, Trompen must wait again.  If I or any of our guild can offer assistance, please, just let us know.  Justice dictates that you receive the epic you have worked so hard for and if Verant had any b*L*s they would just give it to you.<br>

I was one of the Noble Blade members that showed up to help. Spirit of Tunare is the most disrespectful, greedy group of sons of b!tches I have ever witnessed. We obviously had a kill force there to take down ragefire, with more than 20 people there (only 6 or 7 NB). That still wasn't enough to make Shei and his group of mindless followers back off. As soon as Ragefire aggroed on Deamian (a CoN member), they engaged and killed it. <br>
<br>
Good leadership call Shei. You, undoubtedly, are the biggest horse's ass on this server. Those that blindingly followed you today, are sheep.<br>
