While it may not have gone quite as anyone had hoped, I do believe that it was a very good learning experience for those of us who haven't been on many raids yet.  I know I learned quite a few things.<br>
<br>
1.  Listen to the Raid leaders, and do what they say, to the letter.<br>
2.  Only sit when given the ok.<br>
3.  If possible, invis before you sit.<br>
4.  When they tell the clerics to camp, camp!  But also start memming your rez spell (Sorry.)<br>
There's probably a few more things, but I've rambled enough.<br>
<br>
So, thanks again!  If you should ever decide that we all weren't too big a pain and would like to run another raid, I'll be more than happy to come along and help any way I can.  I have had a great time on both the recent Fear and Hate raids, and met a lot of fun people do to this group.<br>

  I think we all learned a lot of good lessons once again, and will be better prepared for the next.  We had a 53 person Army in PoH last night!  That takes a LOT of patience and organization to pull off.  More thanks to Kellroy and Creirwyy for their hard work on this!<br>
  I took a bunch of screen shots of our raid.  I have put them in order from left to right and top to bottom.  The pictures tell the fun and scary story of our adventure in PoH last night.  You can see them on our guild website at:<br>

You both did a awesome job last night. I'm sorry for having to bail after I did a few rez's, but it was way over the time I  was suppose to log. If someone could let me know what I missed after I logged I'd really apreciate it. <br>
<br>
Thank you to Kellory and creirwyy for a great raid. Thank you to blinkers for the wonderful pulling (i will find out  how you got back up there afte you died  hehe). Thank you to Vald  for helping  with the CR. Thank you too Eandyar for getting me drunk (think that was you, but i was so drunk i might have forgot hehe),  And  thank you for the wonderful group I was  in, especially Rbecka who filled  me in on things when I was clueless.

<br>
First and foremost, I have to thank Kellory for taking the intiative to do this raid to start with.  He came to the plate, to give all of us an opportunity to see Hate.  This was my very first Hate Raid.  Kellory was trying to do so much himself, I really was just their to take attendance and be back-up if he went LD (thankyou Goddess of Karana for hearing my prayers, and keeping Kellory on (almost) all nite).<br>
<br>
Secondly to the members.  You know what you guys were awesome.  Yup we had a couple of screw-ups, but you all listened.  The majority of you were so patient.  Your kind words at the end, whether via /ooc or via /pm kept me going until 4am.  I am sorry I didn't stay until the last three got their corpses, but there truly was no more that I could do.<br>
<br>
I think I saw Hate in a productive manner for 30 minutes and yet this truly was an incredible experience for me.  I learned so much last nite and can't wait to stand beside Kellory once again to take on Hate.<br>
<br>
Many of you were real sweethearts last nite, both male and female, that you only inspired me to want to try this again.  You know who you were.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
The Flip Side<br>
<br>
**disclaimer** I do not wish to take away from the words that I have expressed above.  Here are some observations, to help us in the future.<br>
<br>
1) As much as we want to accommodate everyone, there has to be a set limit on how many people come.  I believe we actually had in excess of 66 people at one point, and based on my own tells this was way too much to handle.<br>
<br>
2) The time stated is the sign-up time.  In my own opinion, all sign-ups should be completed within one half hour of that time.  If you want to attend, then ensure you are at the designated area, whether that be an hour before, the night before, the day before or the week before.  Your delay in getting their results in the delay of getting the whole raid started.  If you are going to be late, put it in your sign-up thread and management will try to accommodate you.<br>
<br>
3) If you are a class that requires something or other in order for you to cast.  Then bring enough with you.  Don't depend on raid managment to be able to carry everything for everybody.  We will happily reimburse you on the spot from the collection of the fees.<br>
<br>
4) Please don't spam when we are taking attendance.  At any given time last nite, I was holding down 5 to 6 conversations, not including group chat.  I WANT you to party, I WANT you to have fun, just take it off to the side abit for us.  <br>
<br>
5) This one stunned me last nite.  Don't beg me to add you to the raid and then within 15 -30 minutes ask me for your 100pp back, as you got to leave.  (yes I realize that at times there are RL emergencies).  By the way, one person then ended up back in the raid again &lt;sigh&gt;.  Planes raids/dragons raids are huge time commitments.  Caster classes have it so easy, BYE, got to go and they are gone.  GRRRRRRRR.  Melee don't have this choice.  Give your group leader advance notice, like 30 minutes that you need to leave.  It took us two hours to take down names and make groups to accommodate everyone, you leaving affects your group and probably the raid.  The more notice we have the better.  <br>
<br>
6) Lastly, take example of some great people last nite who took a second of their time to appreciate the efforts of volunteers.  It's hard work and stressful, and no one HAS to do it.  <br>
<br>
See you all in Hate. <p><p align="left"><img border="0" src="http://suspect27.homestead.com/files/cretag.jpg" align="left">

My two trips to Hate were with the KCoG, one was more succesful than the other, but I am just glad to be able to attend and see zones I most likely wouldn't have seen otherwise.  If not for yourselves and many others in KCoG there are a lot of people including myself who would never get to experience any of the planes or dragons.

6.  Be aware of what other CoG people are doing.  In other words, don't ask them to do things when they are running a raid.<br>

I was trembling i was so scared, and apparently i was right to do so since we were trounced just a bit after entry.  But oh well...it was a noble attempt.  Then to be rezzed 2nd or 3rd was also quite an experience.  I went from being with a Raid Party of 60 or so to being in the plane with noone but 2 clerics and a crazy Pirate (thanks Vlad!

Diamond - which as far as I know Kommisar still has.<br>

Some pretty good loot considering that we were only up there for a short while. This was all got while fighting at the portal.<br>

I do have a question for all the researchers out there. What should be done with the Words and Runes that drop during the raid. Having never played a class which needs them I don't really know how they are used.<br>

This was my first planes raid as loot coordinator and I hope I didn't suck too much. I know I made one late call for rolls just as we were leaving the portal room. Sorry for that.<br>
