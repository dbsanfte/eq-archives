Just turning a blind eye to the opinions of anyone who isn't American is at the very least unwise.  Maybe at one point in the past several thousand miles of water separated us from the rest of the world- but it doesn't now.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter if opinions do not 'count.'  It's not like Congress, the Senate, or G.W. himself uses this forum to make decisions on what is and what isn't constitutional.  (well... maybe G.W could in theory)  But back to the topic at hand-<br>
<br>
It is inane for US citizens to think that European, Canadian... world views should not matter in our domestic policy.  Obviously- not paying state / fed taxes denies a vote or anything beyond a voice in the net... but the second we start to say &quot;Hey- you aren't American- shut your hole about me and my own..&quot; is the moment we start taking steps backwards.  It's wrong to place a value on human thought by the nation from which that thought is produced, and although this is a rather pathetic environment in which to stand up for this principle...  I'd rather spend a few minutes typing than allow a isolationist/exclusionist view go unchecked, regardless of the right a US citizen has to it.<br>
<br>
I have the right to listen to the diverse voices of the world- and they have the right to speak.  If I choose to make them count- if a person I don't know in another country changes my opinion on gun-law with well thought out arguments that go beyond the &quot;My constitution (a constitution whose principle quality is its mutability in the face of progress) Says This and Means This- Period!&quot;, then no amount of putting virtual fingers in virtual ears and screaming &quot;La-la-la I can't hear you.&quot; will change that fact.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uyamori.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yamori</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theunholytrinity.org/cracks_smileys/contrib/dvv/boom.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Annoying Bastard</span><br>  Posts: 871<br> <font color=#333333>(12/20/01 8:55:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/verylazybum/bastard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guns?</span><hr size=1> &quot;If you don't vote, your opinion doesn't fucking count&quot;<br>

Minrott gave it.  (granted not in the best tone but stick with me here)  He gave the best reason to own guns.  Because it's our right.  I don't expect Canadians or Europeans to understand this.  We have different histories, let me try to put it in perspective for ya.<br>
<br>
The Rights laid out in the constitution are one of the most important things to Americans.  Without those rights we simply would not be.  We would still be a colonial lacky (sorry canada).  Taking away an Americans rights is like taking away our oxygen.  We can't live without it.  <br>
<br>
Our right to bear arms is one of the fundamental ideas that America was built upon.  Is it antiquated?  Sure you bet, but the idea still holds true.  Because it was written down on a piece of Parchment and signed by our founding fathers.  To Americans that parchment is more holy then any bible.  To rip that part out of our Constitution would be like ripping the the part about Christ dying on the Cross for our sins out of the bible.  The meaning of the whole story would be lost.<br>
<br>
The T-Shirt quote above &quot;I don't agree what you are saying, but I'd die for your right to say it&quot; (or something like that)<br>
<br>
As a Canadian or a European or Asian or whatever I realize that you may not understand the signifigance of that quote to this discussion, but to EVERY American that has meaning.  And even if it's an outsider saying the opposing opinion we as Americans are more then willing to fight for your right to say that opinion. (why the hell do you think we globe-trot fighting other peoples battles for them?  You think we like fighting wars?)<br>
<br>
See to us it's all about rights.  Our right to bear arms, our right of free speech, our right to vote, etc.  I don't own a gun.  Personally, I don't see a need to for me.  I don't live in an overlly dangerous 'hood, nor do I hunt.  But, I'll be damned if I'd let someone take that right away from me.  <br>
<br>
Why, you ask?  I don't use a gun, so therefore I don't use the right.  <br>
<br>
True, but it's all about the ability.  I want to have the option to go out and purchase a firearm.  If I feel threatened, or hell if I feel like going out and shooting me deer for some deer steak.  The ability should be there.  That's what Freedom is all about, and that's what being an American is all about.  <br>
<br>
Clear it up at all?<br>

Taking away one right, a stupid one at that, will not &quot;kill&quot; America. Why is it that many countrys can live without a right to own a gun, yet America must cling to its right to own a gun and would die to defend that right?

<br>
Our rights are not what makes us citizens of the United States- slips of paper in gov't offices are what make us citizens.  The rights that originally started the sha-bang we call the Am. Revolution were:<br>
<br>
a) the right to make money without paying a distant crown, especially without parliamentary power<br>
<br>
and <br>
<br>
b) due process.<br>
<br>
The first rebels did not fight for the right to own firearms, as has been established in above posts.  The Constitution was not made to create Americans, regardless of what the current nationalistic fad may have people dictating...  The Constitution, and the right you are defending, was a device used by the landed gentry and money holders of the US to use the common man in defense of his own holdings.  <br>
<br>
The stamps were getting too expensive, so they gave men the &quot;right to bear arms&quot;-- effectually giving them the right to die for their country- or more specifically, for the interests held by the elite.  <br>
<br>
Be this a 20th century economy centered interpretation of history or not, most the parts seem to fit.   If you want to embrace rights, and say that's what makes Americans unique- embrace the freedoms given to the press (although even that freedom is debatable)... embrace the rights women achieved.  Weapons were given to the common man to defend the interests of the few.  We weren't dumping tea in fits of patriotic fervor... it took years for people to consider America &quot;America&quot;.. and longer for us to be anything United.  <br>
<br>
When our flags reading &quot;Don't Tread on Me&quot; were crafted, it wasn't for the redcoats sitting in their garrisons sipping tea- it was for the businesses getting sat on by ol' Mum England... We didn't get guns to fight for our country, we fought to secure our businesses- and made a country in the process.  Why do you think the quote &quot;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; was originally &quot;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of property?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Turning to Americans believing rights are essential to modern life- and that we'd die for people's rights (the whole &quot;I don't agree with what you say, but I would die for your right to say it.&quot;)... please fit this into the Cold War.  We used everything shy of direct military action (read this as yes, both us and the Russians had satellite/puppet countries fighting for us) to eliminate an opposing way of thought.  Not a country.. communism- the belief that man does not need government to function.  Dangerous eh?  Perhaps to our government, but not our country.  We didn't exactly uphold the belief that Americans defend the rights of others in this situation did we?  We weren't exactly dying for our country in Vietnam eh?  Perhaps on an individual level soldiers felt they were, but the button pushers up in Washington were using those individuals to defend government, not country.  Rights are tied to governments, not land (or &quot;country&quot;).<br>
<br>
We don't cling to rights.  If we cling to anything, its our strong capitalist world hegemony.  We have the right to buy low, sell high, and exploit a southern hemisphere export economy.  You want to talk about us fighting for people's rights?  It's almost laughable.  Some nations still have functioning slavery... Countries where we buy bananas from for 10 cents on the dozen have conditions akin to the irish potato famine (the people of those banana islands are forbidden from eating bananas, just as the irish were forced to subsist on potatoes as they exported ham, corn, and wheat to Britain.)  <br>
<br>
We cling to rights when they suit our purposes, and ignore those inalienable rights almost completely when it fits our needs.  Beliefs otherwise should be filed in Nameless Roleplay- it's better than any fiction I could type up.<br>
<br>
Happy holidays  ^_^<br>

regardless of what Clark says (and I think he IS a politician) it is and should remain our right to own them if we so chose. Like I said before I chose not to, but I will not revoke someone elses right, unless a convicted felon who has given up his rights as far as I'm concerned (but thats a whole different discusion), own one. People from other countries and get on theor soap boxes all they want about how evil guns are and Americans who want to have them. But the bottom line is no one has the right to take the gun away from them. <p>Kuwen Fallenleaf <BR>

Of course it is your right, but an old timer might I ad. In a civilized and modern age like today there shouldn`t be laws like this anymore, sorry. Maybe it fit into the age it was developed at but today? It ran out in my opinion and is WAY out of place.<br>

This standed never for discussion Kuwen. No one tried to take your *precious* (sorry I just came from the Lord of the Rings movie again hehe) away. We discussed why the law is out of date and why the effects of it are bad.<br>

You choose to not have any guns...so your constitution probably forbids them. I don't know I'm not an expert on German laws. Violence is a part of human nature...not to rub this in your face or anything, BUT the neo-nazi killings here of late in Eastern Germany (Not East Germany, I know yall have reunited). Those people should have been able to defend themselves, no? Why set yourself up to be a victim when you can and should be allowed to defend your life or the lives of any innocent person like this. Or what about the IRA or whatever the hell the name of that group in Spain is...anyway the normal everyday hardworking citizen should be able to defend their home and livelihood if threatened right?

While the foundation of Europe was paved by Romans with gladii (or is it gladium? gladiuseseses?), it can be postulated that the gun made America.  Our thunder-sticks (and germs) enforced our desire to expand... That expansion being another reason we chose to revolt (the British had a treaty to stay out of Native American territory- one that was quickly ignored with the creation of a new nation).  Whoop tangent.   <br>
<br>
Fast forwarding several hundred years, guns were the tool of choice in defending one's property in a time of frontier justice and law.  When government could not protect the land of the citizens, the gun allowed a homesteader to keep poachers/thieves off of his land.  As far as I know, this is a unique situation- and very much at the heart of this &quot;firearms are needed to protect my XYZ&quot; spirit.<br>
<br>
Moving on again, with the immigration boom, and the influx of different cultures (many fighting for  limited job opportunities) so too came a renewed need for weapons.  Public servants, such as the police, could care less if one immigrant family was killed, or stolen from, by another- they didn't have the resources to keep the peace.  This &quot;need&quot; for firearms has continued evolving at every stage in US history.  Very often people who are disenfranchised find the only source of respect and power on the street is in owning, and flaunting, a gun of some sort.<br>
<br>
At every step we've had guns, and this possession has become a social norm.  Personally, I don't think attacking a constitutional right will negate any of the... negatives that our country has with the ownership of firearms.  Beyond the occasional child losing his or her face after poking into his parent's ill-kept weaponry, our problems are mostly with those who own firearms beyond the law, and who would own firearms regardless of whether or not we had a law allowing the sale of them.<br>
<br>
They say &quot;Guns don't kill people, People kill people;&quot; I would have to amend that.  People kill people *because* the system we live in promotes murder.  It is hardly surprising that welfare states in Europe are utopian in comparison to the USA.   Our &quot;American Way&quot; however prevents this, as we constantly enforce social inequality, through inheritance, dog-eat-dog economics etc.  It is hardly surprising that there is a &quot;need&quot; to own a weapon, if that weapon is needed to hold up a store to earn money because there is no other way to, or if the only way to get street cred is to wave a weapon about.<br>
<br>
Amending the Constitution, which in its own right is *More* American than not, will hardly impact the bad effects of weapons in our country.  We'd get a bunch of annoyed gun owners, an overstock of unshot clay pigeons, a dangerous overpopulation of deer, and perhaps a few less homicides and accidental injuries- but it wouldn't eliminate the problem.  If you think people have an easy time smuggling narcotics into the USA, you can imagine how much easier it would be to smuggle guns in.  What exactly would a &quot;Gun Dog&quot; sniff?<br>
<br>
I don't like the sheer number of weapons that are in America, but I believe amending the constitution would be a patch to the problems, not the solution.  This problem is systemic, and trying to dig it out will take much more change then two more lines in our law books.  <br>
<br>
And if I'm called a politician again, I'll ask this to be moved to Rants and Flames. I will not be insulted so! ^_^ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umesana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mesana</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#333333>(12/25/01 12:23:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guns?</span><hr size=1> I have read the part where you said you have no gun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

Now about the last part of your post. No actually our laws don`t forbid us the use of guns but in order to own and wield a gun legally you need to have a license, something like a driving license for a car were you undergo some tests and they check your background, address etc.<br>
<br>
Sorry but I totally disagree, even if the people had guns back then there would have been NO way to resist the Nazi`s like you want me to believe. The children have been all in camps, the boys in military for training and the girls eitherway on farms working or undergoing medic training, all under control of the Governemnt. Do you really think the parents would have done even ONE thing knowing they could kill their kid that way? <br>
<br>
Even if they had guns it takes some major balls to fight against something as big and powerfull as the Nazi government in that time. Germany took on half the world! (about 99 Nations if I`m right). To be honest I highly doubt a little resistance within could have caused much damage. This would have been pure suicide and it takes a true Hero to sacrifiece his life for a heroic but lost cause like this.<br>

and yes...anyone who owns a gun has to have it licensed here too. We just can't go the corner market and pick one up...legally anyway, and its the law abiding American we are talking about here.

I think there are too many pro and contra`s on this subject and it`s hard to try and convince someone for one or the other side, we have different point of views but I respect yours and some arguments aren`t too bad. So for Xmas sake I`m gonna leave it there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And as I said earlier, there are other ways to defend yourself then with a gun, making the need to have a gun for self defense arguement, useless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukuwenfallenleaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KuwenFallenleaf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md96-jma/eq/us.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Peanut Gallery</span><br>  Posts: 1243<br> <font color=#333333>(12/25/01 4:25:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=71>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.interplay.com/bgate2/images2/mainimage1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guns?</span><hr size=1> Hedges, defend your home however you see fit.
