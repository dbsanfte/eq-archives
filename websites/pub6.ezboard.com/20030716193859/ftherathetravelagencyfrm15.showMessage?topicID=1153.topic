<br>
I know I've said a lot of things on these boards, things that would disturb a lot of people, things that would make some laugh, and some things that are just stupid.<br>
we all have our vices, for me I guess this was it.<br>
<br>
I want to apologize to those who have felt bad due to anything I've posted on here. I guess I don't mind so much if you don't like me, but I do know how it feels to be left out, made fun of, discriminated against, or just plain hurt. I don't want anyone to have to feel that way.<br>
If I made you feel anything other than comiucal relief due to anything I've ever posted on these boards, please forgive me. Though you do not know me and probably never will, I feel honest remorse for the things I've said here, without giving thought to the feelings of those who might be reading.<br>
<br>
That said, I don't think I have ever actually done anything that would be considered *bad* to anyone in the game. Like KSing or Ripping people off or anything like that.<br>
<br>
I am goin to check this thread for the next couple of days, and it's my hope that if I have done something to you in the game that would be considered *bad*, please post your character's name here, you can leave details if you want but you don't need to, I intend to do nothing to you other than to personally extend an apology to you.<br>
<br>
These are the characters I play/have played and the time frames I played them.<br>
<br>
Grulnick - From level 1 - 60 - August, 2000 - Stopped Playing June 2002 - Druid - Guilds: Shadow Followers, Spirit Bound, Legends Of Marr, Legend of Marr, Spirit of Tunare<br>
<br>
Leiph - From Level 1 - 55 - January 2002 - Stopped playing July 2002 - Rogue - Guilds: Spirit of Tunare<br>
<br>
Grulagan - From Level 60 - 65 - December 2002 - Current - Warrior (Previously Owned by... not me) - Guilds: Never been guilded since the name changed. If you want to know the previous name, look it up...<br>
<br>
There are others, but I haven't had any real social interaction on any of them. Other than close friends who don't need me to post them anyways.<br>
<br>
I'm not posting this to attract flames, or to cleanse myself of any wrong doing, or to try and look noble. This is just the only place I know of that I think most folks will see it.<br>
<br>
So again, please if I have done something wrong to you, let me know so that I can apologize. Thanks,<br>
<br>
-JRH<br>
<br>
PS: I realize I've done something not so smart in this post, noone has to point it out, I did it knowing it was dumb. If someone chooses to take advantage of it then so be it. I really don't have much to lose right now anyhow.<br>

And i really dont see how you did anything stupid in your post, if you mean the acct that wasnt yours, i read somewhere that 70% of people that play EQ have bought something before off ebay, and the only stupid thing would be trying to deny it and that it was your char forever.  Its those morons who are like &quot;ive played this warrior forever and i got him every piece of elemental armor by raiding, So should i hit taunt every time it pops up or just once at the beginning of the fight&quot;<br>
<br>
But whatever, leaving the commumity shouldnt really be done ive actually quit EQ for a good 6 months and i still come here even though half the crap they talk about now days i dont understand but i just nod my head and smile.  Anyways bud you'll be missed stop by every now and then we'll be happy to welcome you back if ever you need it some smiling, and not so smiling faces. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seerfamily>Seer Family</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 230<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/23/03 12:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1153.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I know I was leaving here, but...</span><hr size=1> Grul,<br>
<br>
You and I have had our share of disagreements based on strongly held personal views. But I have no problem with you here or in game.<br>
<br>
As to you leaving here, I understand you have some RL anger issues and these are prob based on biochemical problems. While you have occasionally gone over the top, so have we all on occasion. That you are aware of it when you have done it....grats..most people aren't.<br>
<br>
Contrary to some psychiatric views avoiding a community does not seem to me to be a healthy way to deal with that.<br>
<br>
If you chose to leave this board, in order to deal with your problems in real life so be it. That is a personal choice only you can make.<br>
<br>
You will be missed. I will not say that for everyone who has chosen to leave.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with you in game or on message board.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you.<br>

I really was just trying to figure out if I am really an asshole or just a percieved asshole.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have a confession to make. That time my wife came on here and said I needed medication. That was me logged onto her account. You know, since I'm bearing all now, may as well come clean fully. <br>
<br>
I actually do take stimulants to help control ADHD that I have. But, I am not crazy or anything, I just get one of two ways, either inattentive, like ummm you die to mobs enraging a lot foir example, or hyperattentive, meaning you are so addicted to an online game that replace your real life with the game life.<br>
<br>
I've been on both sides of that spectrum over the past year or so, all under control now though.<br>
<br>
You guys are a lot nicer to me than I deserver.<br>
<br>
Brumpy, I can't figure out if I you posted cause of something I did to you, or if you're just posting to say hello. I'll shoot you a tell, either way it's good to see you back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Where's Rugge?<br>
<br>
I really don't want to stay off the RTA, I like the community a lot. I just feel that as a player the things I've done on here in the past have caused damage to my name in the game, where I always thought that it wouldn't matter, I was wrong. Just trying to repair any damage that I can. It's not cool when people you don't even know hate you, but reading over some old stuff I can understand why they would.<br>
<br>
Anyways, Yea I am on SWG Beta. I can't play a lot because man that server crashes a lot, that game needs work haha, but it's gonna be a cool game I think. For sure if you are a power gamer you will probably hate the hell out of it. But if you just like to play for socialism, or if you like the economic aspect of games,  you might like it.<br>
<br>
One thing I hate is that you can't be a Jedi, well you can, but like you have to unlocvk your Jedi Slot, and to get it unlocked is sorta like doing an epic quest. Then you make a brand new toon that is &quot;Force Sensitive&quot; and if it gets killed you are perm dead and have to start over. Kind of nutty, but keeps everyone from being Jedi. Although it's kind of hard to die right now, I have a Medic and a Brawler and I don't think I've ever died on either of them, and fighting is like sorta boring like turn based, but it requires some thought at times. Kind of cool to use a Tuskan rifle firing back as you run away from a Jawa hehe.<br>
<br>
Anyways, catch you guys later. I will shoot you a tell in the game Brumpy.<br>
<br>

<br>
The developers told us that's how it works.Though I'm guessing there's still time to change if the beta community hates it enough.<br>
<br>
Also the permakilled thing only happens until you get your guy to Jedi Master, supposedly once you reach master you can clone just like anyone else.<br>
<br>
(You have to store your cloning pattern at these little stations so that you can re cloned if you die. Same thing as binding. Also you can insure all your gear too so that when you die you have all your stuff, if you don't insure then you have to go loot your corpse.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wollverinerathe>Wollverine Rathe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/25/03 3:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1153.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.tiscali.be/tribio/pictures/bangdesk.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I know I was leaving here, but...</span><hr size=1> Grul has wronged me in the past and I want an apologie!!
