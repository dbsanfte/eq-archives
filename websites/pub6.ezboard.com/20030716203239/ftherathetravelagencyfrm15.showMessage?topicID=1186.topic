<br>
I want to know why the hell people take this game so seriously.<br>
<br>
I want to know when it stops being a game and starts being an obsession.<br>
<br>
Why the fuck is someone any better than me, simply because they have better equipment, when the only reason they have better equipment, is because A.) I don't want to drop tons of cash on ebay for a stormhammer supertwink. or B.) They have more time to waste than me?<br>
<br>
Answer please, anyone.<br>
<br>
Also, tell me this. Why, in this game, if someone makes a mistake or does something wrong, there is no forgiveness, there is no second chance, they are worthless waste of skin and air for life and have no chance for redemption. Why?<br>
<br>
Now, I can understand, for some people being in this game, is better than being in real life, scoff at that statement if you will but it's true. Some folks, very few but some, are so fucked in one way or another that their life is better in the game and I fully believe that.<br>
<br>
Anyways, flame bait of the day.

<br>
Along the same lines, a lot of &quot;retired&quot; players still visit boards to keep in touch with friends from the game, and for some reason some of them feel the need to bash those that still play.<br>
<br>
That's my take on it anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=umbali>Umbali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 440<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/12/03 3:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1186.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I want a new thread</span><hr size=1> /shrug why did Michael Jordan get treated different than your avg NBA player? Was it cus he wasted more time practicing when he was young? Maybe he was gifted? Either way , EQ reflects real life cus real life people play it. <br>
<br>
People tend to recognize you by your in game accomplishments , whether they be the mobs you have beaten or the acts of kindness you show others. Sadly neither of these are recognized most of the time by the same group of people. The people who would be impressed by your gear prolly wouldnt be impressed by your act of kindness. And vice versa.<br>
<br>
EQ is a game that requires an immense amount of time in order for an individual reach certain accomplishments. These accomplishments are measured often by the loot they have.  Most people take their time seriously. If you put a ton of time into something and some fucktard that doesnt wanna pay the price comes along and fucks up something you worked for wouldnt that upset you?  <br>
<br>
EQ is a game , yes. I take sports seriously and they are games. Just because something is a game doesnt mean it shouldnt be taken seriously.<br>
<br>
The one thing I hate most growing up was playing sports or something in school and some people not trying. The teachers always gave that bullshit about &quot; its not whether you win or lose but its how you play the game &quot; or &quot; playing for fun&quot; ..<br>
<br>
Bullshit. If it doesnt matter , dont freaking keep score. If  you keep score then bust your nuts to win.<br>

Heh, I find the boards far more entertaining then EQ itself, and probablly spend 5 hours on EQ boards for every 1 hour in EQ itself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
i hear ya.<br>
<br>
as far as taking the game seriously, i put blood, sweat, and tears into my toons. i will take it seriously with times of light heartedness! i laugh at ppl that say it is just a game...heh<br>
my toon is my kind of (art, trophy) work, it is what i started with in the begining of interest and have grown with though smart, dumb, and interesting ppl in my venture. <br>
to say it is a game to me is to say that things we grow an interest in is beneath us all and we should only watch movies in the grey glowing light of boredom and all music is to be silent!<br>
<br>
there are some that take it too far to the extreme as to dressup and carry on in RL as their toon would in the game.<br>
<br>
but i see your point...to a point.<br>
<br>
as far as the line....look up the rules for a gambler or substance user. at the point it runs your life i think you should step back!<br>
<br>
as far as better players....mmm i feel your pain.<br>
i see often time that many classes/races are a number! thats it....sure the loot they get helps...can help ALOT!<br>
only when you get them in a 6 party group you see their worth, but for high end raids i have see,been in, and heard...the single awsome/worst player only needs to do 1 thing........listen! <br>
listening to the the direction from the raid leader and not FUCK up the raid!<br>
<br>
it is this that most place in high reguard....be there and listen to the directions!...sigh<br>
i have see others of my class to be equal to me and some better/worse in the 6 party groupings. but in a raid it doesnt matter in MOST cases. there are some exceptions.<br>
<br>
the mistake thing...cant anwser you there, you get a reputation your going to have a hard time fixing it.<br>
<br>
the RL messed up thing...again i cant anwser...it is RL.<br>
i have seen ppl do some weird and fucked up shit in my life on this ball for sometime now. just laugh it off, learn from it,  or go OMG and keep the vision in your head and go see someone about it!<br>
<br>
ppl are like fingernails: <br>
can be: all colors <br>
can be: made to look pretty<br>
can be: ugly<br>
can be: cut off <br>
can be: too long<br>
can be: too short <br>
can be: too thin<br>
can be: too fat<br>
can be: in-grown <br>
can be: hurtfull to you<br>
can be: hurtfull to others<br>
can be: helpfull to you<br>
can be: helpfull to others<br>
can be: chewed on<br>
can be: taken care of<br>
can be: ignored<br>
can: pick at you<br>
can: become missing.<br>

So if you do read the whole thread, what do you end up with? A huge set of sequential postings full of ridiculous comments and generally mediocre humor.

Some of us (like I) come here to flame the people that suck ass because we are not allowed to do it in EQ (because of GMs catering to pussies). If I said half of the things that i'm allowed to say here....all of my accounts would be banned in mere minutes. Where else can I create a persona that allows me to be the asshole you love to hate? Hell, the first 200 posts of mine were to be as rude as I can and get away with it :P (which later on got boring)<br>
<br>
Another reason this appeals to people is because it is drama and humor. Drama + comedy rolled into one = high ratings.<br>
You have to admit that F.C. is more interesting than &quot;Seinfeld&quot; or &quot;Friends&quot;. <br>
<br>
Theres only a small number of people that I would hate on in real life. Those are the same weasels that live with thier parents and hate me because I left the old crowd because of thier anon-twofaced-backstabbing of each other on a daily basis (you couple guys know who you are). <br>
<br>
I'm just waiting for the next idiot to get on his mom's comp and leap out of the shadows and try to flame me. (Most of you will be ignored to show that you mean nothing to me.)<br>

Its not like I flamed everyone in EQ. I've only flamed about 25 people from our server.

EQ is not a game, they can call it one all they want, but it's not. It's not a lifestyle or an existance either.<br>

I know exactly what it is.<br>

It's a hobby, and like any hobby some people become extremly involved in it. So compare it to Model Cars, Coin Collecting, Horse Riding, Photography, even Gaming.<br>

All it is, is a hobby. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nyca>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Singing Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 1638<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/13/03 9:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1186.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/slllyonec/EZemo/LeahHarp2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> What surprises me is that someone comes to a Web Site that was created by folks who play EQ, to have a place to talk about EQ, and then is surprised that all the posts are about EQ.  <br>
<br>
If you don't like the game, have quit the game, and have nothing good to say about the game, why do you even come here to post?  <br>
<br>
Those of us who post here play the game, enjoy the game, love talking about the game.<br>

When you suggested you might leave..most of us said you shouldn't.<br>
<br>
And as you accurately observed a year ago we would have pooled our money to buy you a new game to get you out of here.<br>
<br>
As to the rest..../shrug.<br>
<br>
I disagree on the rest. I certainly don't have the best armor and no one would call me a power gamer, but I think most of the time I am competent player, and I get plenty of respect.<br>

<br>
I've been on it every day for the last month, maybe not long but a little.<br>
<br>
Even if I did quit, I woulkd post here, why? Because I like the RTA people. See RTA people are a whole seperate community outside of EQ, Most play EQ still, but hell there's people on these boards that haven't played it in years.<br>
<br>
Also, I never said anything against talking about EQ or playing it, Nycah you must have taken my post wrong or something.<br>
<br>
Anyways, there's a simple fact here. It's one thing to play, and ok to play a lot, but I have to say that some people are just obsessive. If you are on this game more than you spend outside of your home, then you have issues and I would seek professional help.<br>
<br>
As far as the other stuff, It's just something to taslk about, I'm not upset because to be honest if I wanted anything in this game I have the means to get it, it just comes down to whether you personally feel like it's worth it.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself if you died today and your life flashed before your eyes, would you see anything other than the back of your head as you sat at the computer desk your entire life playing EQ? Then, if your answer is no, ask yourself if you are ok with that.<br>
<br>
Think about it...<br>
<br>
And for Umbali, I hate to say it, but I think Mike Jordan earns more skill points in my book than anyone in this game, because no amount of poractice can suppliment real talent. You need no talent to play this game, all you need is enough education to read and typoe, a fast enough computer, and a shitload of time to waste.<br>
<br>
What I am saying, is that being uber in EQ does not set you apart at all from anyone else, except maybe in your own mind, all it shows is that you don't get out much.<br>
<br>
Then again, maybe you are one fucked up looking individual, and you are better off staying inside anyhow.<br>

Heck I dont even rank when it comes to uber gear. I wasnt refering to myself. I was answering generically. <br>
<br>
You asked a general question , i gave you a general answer in part of it. Personally I dont like people that fuckup all the time in game or out.  Does that make them not worth their skin? No . Those are your words.  Id just rather not play with them.  Remember Queeny? Or when you in SoT then? Queeny always fucked up on raids...trained the camp..nuked herself dead. So , i didnt group with Queeny. Didnt make her/him a better or worse person , just that i didnt wanna share my hobby time like that.  <br>
<br>
Yeah maybe the Michael Jordon comparision wasnt as accurate as I would have liked , but the point remains...there are reasons why some people get treated or act different. Right or wrong.<br>
<br>
As far as maybe staying in the house cus im that fucked up. Perhaps.  Altho perhaps that would best be applied to a person who makes up shit , acts like its his wife , and behaves in a bizzare manner. Seems that person would need the protection of the indoors as well.<br>

The stuff posted under my wife's account name was true, just wasn't her posting it, so I didn't make it up.<br>
<br>
But, I guess yea you can trust me when I say that there's are tons of people that would rather I just stay home some days lol.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to piss people off with this one, just trying to see what y'all think, and maybe get you to think if you're not already thinking.<br>
<br>
There's another side of the story though, there are some people, who knows who or where they are so nothing implied here, that could not normally be successful in RL due to physical or mental impairment. For those people, games and hobbies like EQ give them a way to enjoy their time without worrying about how mean people in society can be, they can be in a world where the problems they have in RL don't get in their way. For this I think that the game is a really good thing.<br>
<br>
For me, to be totally honest, this game almost cost me my career, my family, and my life. Now under control but at one time, way overboard and I would hate to see someone else go the same way.<br>
<br>
Funny though that now I have a small army of EQ accounts due to friends quitting heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=norbard>NOR Bard</A>&nbsp;
