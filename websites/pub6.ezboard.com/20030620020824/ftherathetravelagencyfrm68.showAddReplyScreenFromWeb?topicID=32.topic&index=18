<br>
Yes, back the then was some fringe association with whackos, but they were the fringe. The Weather Underground, and such.<br>
<br>
The core of the movement was made up of people freaked out about being sent to Vietnam, morally opposed to killing (not to war, but to killing - conscientious objector, and some who felt that the Vietnam war was really really wrong for lots of legitimate reasons. At that time we had all seen friends come back all twisted or lost friends in the war. I fit into all of the above categories, and except whacko. We marched (with permits) everywhere, we held huge protest marches into Wahsington, like 500,000 people +. I wrote my draft board often. There was very little destruction of property. We protested peacefully, legally for the most part. We protested the war, not the USA. We behaved peacefully to enforce our message: Give Peace a Chance.<br>
<br>
These protest are very different. The stated objectives are very different. <br>

The Rage, the Pride and the Doubt<br>
<br>
BY ORIANA FALLACI<br>
<br>
NEW YORK -- To avoid the dilemma of whether this war should take place or not, to overcome the reservations and the reluctance and the doubts that still lacerate me, I often say to myself: &quot;How good if the Iraqis would get free of Saddam Hussein by themselves. How good if they would execute him and hang up his body by the feet as in 1945 we Italians did with Mussolini.&quot; But it does not help. Or it helps in one way only. The Italians, in fact, could get free of Mussolini because in 1945 the Allies had conquered almost four-fifths of Italy. In other words, because the Second World War had taken place. A war without which we would have kept Mussolini (and Hitler) forever. A war during which the allies had pitilessly bombed us and we had died like mosquitoes. The Allies, too. At Salerno, at Anzio, at Cassino. Along the road from Rome to Florence, then on the terrible Gothic Line. In less than two years, 45,806 dead among the Americans and 17,500 among the English, the Canadians, the Australians, the New Zealanders, the South Africans, the Indians, the Brazilians. And also the French who had chosen De Gaulle, also the Italians who had chosen the Fifth or the Eighth Army. (Can anybody guess how many cemeteries of Allied soldiers there are in Italy? More than sixty. And the largest, the most crowded, are the American ones. At Nettuno, 10,950 graves. At Falciani, near Florence, 5,811. Each time I pass in front of it and see that lake of crosses, I shiver with grief and gratitude.) There was also a National Liberation Front in Italy. A Resistance that the Allies supplied with weapons and ammunition. As in spite of my tender age (14), I was involved in the matter, I remember well the American plane that, braving anti-aircraft fire, parachuted those supplies to Tuscany. To be exact, onto Mount Giovi where one night they air-dropped commandos with the task of activating a short-wave network named Radio Cora. Ten smiling Americans who spoke very good Italian and who three months later were captured by the SS, tortured, and executed with a Florentine partisan girl: Anna Maria Enriquez-Agnoletti.<br>
<br>
Thus, the dilemma remains.<br>
<br>
It remains for the reasons I will try to state. And the first one is that, contrary to the pacifists who never yell against Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden and only yell against George W. Bush and Tony Blair, (but in their Rome march they also yelled against me and raised posters wishing that I'd blow up with the next shuttle, I'm told), I know war very well. I know what it means to live in terror, to run under air strikes and cannonades, to see people killed and houses destroyed, to starve and dream of a piece of bread, to miss even a glass of drinking water. And (which is worse) to be or to feel responsible for someone else's death. I know it because I belong to the Second World War generation and because, as a member of the Resistance, I was myself a soldier. I also know it because for a good deal of my life I have been a war correspondent. Beginning with Vietnam, I have experienced horrors that those who see war only through TV or the movies where blood is tomato ketchup don't even imagine. As a consequence, I hate it as the pacifists in bad or good faith never will. I loathe it. Every book I have written overflows with that loathing, and I cannot bear the sight of guns. At the same time, however, I don't accept the principle, or should I say the slogan, that &quot;All wars are unjust, illegitimate.&quot; The war against Hitler and Mussolini and Hirohito was just, was legitimate. The Risorgimento wars that my ancestors fought against the invaders of Italy were just, were legitimate. And so was the war of independence that Americans fought against Britain. So are the wars (or revolutions) which happen to regain dignity, freedom. I do not believe in vile acquittals, phony appeasements, easy forgiveness. Even less, in the exploitation or the blackmail of the word Peace. When peace stands for surrender, fear, loss of dignity and freedom, it is no longer peace. It's suicide.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
The second reason is that this war should not happen now. If just as I wish, legitimate as I hope, it should have happened one year ago. That is, when the ruins of the Towers were still smoking and the whole civilized world felt American. Had it happened then, the pacifists who never yell against Saddam or bin Laden would not today fill the squares to anathematize the United States. Hollywood stars would not play the role of Messiahs, and ambiguous Turkey would not cynically deny passage to the Marines who have to reach the Northern front. Despite the Europeans who added their voice to the voice of the Palestinians howling &quot;Americans-got-it-good,&quot; one year ago nobody questioned that another Pearl Harbor had been inflicted on the U.S. and that the U.S. had all the right to respond. As a matter of fact, it should have happened before. I mean when Bill Clinton was president, and small Pearl Harbors were bursting abroad. In Somalia, in Kenya, in Yemen. As I shall never tire of repeating, we did not need September 11 to see that the cancer was there. September 11 was the excruciating confirmation of a reality which had been burning for decades, the indisputable diagnosis of a doctor who waves an X-ray and brutally snaps: &quot;My dear Sir, you have cancer.&quot; Had Mr. Clinton spent less time with voluptuous girls, had he made smarter use of the Oval Office, maybe September 11 would not have occurred. And, needless to say, even less would it have occurred if the first George Bush had removed Saddam with the Gulf War. For Christ's sake, in 1991 the Iraqi army deflated like a pricked balloon. It disintegrated so quickly, so easily, that even I captured four of its soldiers. I was behind a dune in the Saudi desert, all alone. Four skeletal creatures in ragged uniforms came toward me with arms raised, and whispered: &quot;Bush, Bush.&quot; Meaning: &quot;Please take me prisoner. I am so thirsty, so hungry.&quot; So I took them prisoner. I delivered them to the Marine in charge, and instead of congratulating me he grumbled: &quot;Dammit! Some more?!?&quot; Yet the Americans did not get to Baghdad, did not remove Saddam. And, to thank them, Saddam tried to kill their president. The same president who had left him in power. In fact, at times I wonder if this war isn't also a long-awaited retaliation, a filial revenge, a promise made by the son to the father. Like in a Shakespearean tragedy. Better, a Greek one.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
The third reason is the wrong way in which the promise has materialized. Let's admit it: from September 11 until last summer, all the stress was put on bin Laden, on al Qaeda, on Afghanistan. Saddam and Iraq were practically ignored. Only when it became clear that bin Laden was in good health, that the solemn commitment to take him dead or alive had failed, were we reminded that Saddam existed too. That he was not a gentle soul, that he cut the tongues and ears of his adversaries, that he killed children in front of their parents, that he decapitated women then displayed their heads in the streets, that he kept his prisoners in cells as small as coffins, that he made his biological or chemical experiments on them too. That he had connections with al Qaeda and supported terrorism, that he rewarded the families of Palestinian kamikazes at the rate of $25,000 each. That he had never disarmed, never given up his arsenal of deadly weapons, thus the U.N. should send back the inspectors, and let's be serious: if seventy years ago the ineffective League of Nations had sent its inspectors to Germany, do you think that Hitler would have shown them Peenemünde where Von Braun was manufacturing V2s? Do you think that Hitler would have disclosed the camps of Auschwitz, of Mauthausen, Buchenwald, Dachau? Yet the inspection comedy resumed. With such intensity that the role of prima donna passed from bin Laden to Saddam, and the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the engineer of September 11, was greeted almost with indifference. A comedy marked by the double games of the inspectors and the conflicting strategies of Mr. Bush who on the one hand asked the Security Council for permission to use force and on the other sent his troops to the front. In less than two months, a quarter of a million troops. With the British and Australians, 310,000. And all this without realizing that his enemies (but I should say the enemies of the West) are not only in Baghdad.<br>
<br>
They are also in Europe. They are in Paris where the mellifluous Jacques Chirac does not give a damn for peace but plans to satisfy his vanity with the Nobel Peace Prize. Where there is no wish to remove Saddam Hussein because Saddam Hussein means the oil that the French companies pump from Iraqi wells. And where (forgetting a little flaw named Petain) France chases its Napoleonic desire to dominate the European Union, to establish its hegemony over it. They are in Berlin, where the party of the mediocre Gerhard Schroeder won the elections by comparing Mr. Bush to Hitler, where American flags are soiled with the swastika, and where, in the dream of playing the masters again, Germans go arm-in-arm with the French. They are in Rome where the communists left by the door and re-entered through the window like the birds of the Hitchcock movie. And where, pestering the world with his ecumenism, his pietism, his Thirdworldism, Pope Wojtyla receives Tariq Aziz as a dove or a martyr who is about to be eaten by lions. (Then he sends him to Assisi where the friars escort him to the tomb of St. Francis.) In the other European countries, it is more or less the same. In Europe your enemies are everywhere, Mr. Bush. What you quietly call &quot;differences of opinion&quot; are in reality pure hate. Because in Europe pacifism is synonymous with anti-Americanism, sir, and accompanied by the most sinister revival of anti-Semitism the anti-Americanism triumphs as much as in the Islamic world. Haven't your ambassadors informed you? Europe is no longer Europe. It is a province of Islam, as Spain and Portugal were at the time of the Moors. It hosts almost 16 million Muslim immigrants and teems with mullahs, imams, mosques, burqas, chadors. It lodges thousands of Islamic terrorists whom governments don't know how to identify and control. People are afraid, and in waving the flag of pacifism -- pacifism synonymous with anti-Americanism -- they feel protected.<br>
<br>
Besides, Europe does not care for the 221,484 Americans who died for her in the Second World War. Rather than gratitude, their cemeteries give rise to resentment. As a consequence, in Europe nobody will back this war. Not even nations which are officially allied with the U.S., not even the prime ministers who call you &quot;My friend George.&quot; (Like Silvio Berlusconi.) In Europe you only have one friend, one ally, sir: Tony Blair. But Mr. Blair too leads a country which is invaded by the Moors. A country that hides that resentment. Even his party opposes him, and by the way: I owe you an apology, Mr. Blair. In my book &quot;The Rage and the Pride,&quot; I was unfair to you. Because I wrote that you would not persevere with your guts, that you would drop them as soon as it would no longer serve your political interests. With impeccable coherence, instead, you are sacrificing those interests to your convictions. Indeed, I apologize. I also withdraw the phrase I used to comment on your excess of courtesy toward Islamic culture: &quot;If our culture has the same value as the one that imposes the burqa, why do you spend your summers in my Tuscany and not in Saudi Arabia?&quot; Now I say: &quot;My Tuscany is your Tuscany, sir. My home is your home.&quot;<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
The final reason for my dilemma is the definition that Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair and their advisers give of this war: &quot;A Liberation war. A humanitarian war to bring freedom and democracy to Iraq.&quot; Oh, no. Humanitarianism has nothing to do with wars. All wars, even just ones, are death and destruction and atrocities and tears. And this is not a liberation war, a war like the Second World War. (By the way: neither is it an &quot;oil war,&quot; as the pacifists who never yell against Saddam or bin Laden maintain in their rallies. Americans do not need Iraqi oil.) It is a political war. A war made in cold blood to respond to the Holy War that the enemies of the West declared upon the West on September 11. It is also a prophylactic war. A vaccine, a surgery that hits Saddam because, (Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair believe), among the various focuses of cancer Saddam is the most obvious and dangerous one. Moreover, the obstacle that once removed will permit them to redesign the map of the Middle East as the British and the French did after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. To redesign it and to spread a Pax Romana, pardon, a Pax Americana, in which everybody will prosper through freedom and democracy. Again, no. Freedom cannot be a gift. And democracy cannot be imposed with bombs, with occupation armies. As my father said when he asked the anti-fascists to join the Resistance, and as today I say to those who honestly rely on the Pax Americana, people must conquer freedom by themselves. Democracy must come from their will, and in both cases a country must know what they consist of. In Europe the Second World War was a liberation war not because it brought novelties called freedom and democracy but because it re-established them. Because Europeans knew what they consisted of. The Japanese did not: it is true. In Japan, those two treasures were somehow a gift, a refund for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But Japan had already started its process of modernization, and did not belong to the Islamic world. As I write in my book when I call bin Laden the tip of the iceberg and I define the iceberg as a mountain that has not moved for 1,400 years, that for 1,400 years has not changed, that has not emerged from its blindness, freedom and democracy are totally unrelated to the ideological texture of Islam. To the tyranny of theocratic states. So their people refuse them, and even more they want to erase ours.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
Upheld by their stubborn optimism, the same optimism for which at the Alamo they fought so well and all died slaughtered by Santa Anna, Americans think that in Baghdad they will be welcomed as they were in Rome and Florence and Paris. &quot;They'll cheer us, throw us flowers.&quot; Maybe. In Baghdad anything can happen. But after that? Nearly two-thirds of the Iraqis are Shiites who have always dreamed of establishing an Islamic Republic of Iraq, and the Soviets too were once cheered in Kabul. They too imposed their peace. They even succeeded in convincing women to take off their burqa, remember? After a while, though, they had to leave. And the Taliban came. Thus, I ask: what if instead of learning freedom Iraq becomes a second Talibani Afghanistan? What if instead of becoming democratized by the Pax Americana the whole Middle East blows up and the cancer multiplies? As a proud defender of the West's civilization, without reservations I should join Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair in the new Alamo. Without reluctance I should fight and die with them.

Personally I am staunchly pro USA! And if ever there is to be a war for the right reasons, it is this one, and IMO it is way past due. The UN has disgraced itself, led by France. We will soon find out just how horrible life was for 24 million of the 25 million Iraqis, which this &quot;Anti-War&quot; movement worked to perpetuate. The human spirit should be nurtured, not defiled. We should be more pro active in exporting our most precious treasures: Democracy, Capitalism, and the right to be HAPPY.<br>

<br>
The U.S. has found NO evidence of WMD as of yet (though reporters are having a fun time reporting some new &quot;find&quot; every other day, which is promptly shown to be false the next day in Pentagon and State Department press briefings).<br>
<br>
Morons across the U.S. are changing their minds on the war simply because &quot;we are winning&quot; (I find those people more disgusting than the most hawkish people, at least the staunch war supporters aren't weak-minded hypocrits).<br>
<br>
More an more this &quot;war&quot; is being turned into an Iraqi liberation rather than the &quot;enforcing&quot; of UN resolutions it supposedly was about (politicians make me sick).<br>
<br>
More and more in the press the &quot;anti-war&quot; position is being portrayed as either neo-hippo make love not war bullshit, or as somehow a pro-Saddam or pro-Iraqi peoples suffering position (I wish I could line up reporters to blow their brains out right after I did the politicians and the religious people).<br>
<br>
Why am I quiet? Well, other than the obvious fact my life doesn't revolve around a message board for a game I stopped playing, what is there to talk about? Nothing substantive has changed, right? Nothing has been found to legally justify this war. We are rolling right along like everyone but the most ardently delusioned arab out in the middle east expected. Iraqis are happy to have Saddam gone, like everyone knew was going to happen (that's what happens when the majority if individuals in a country and strict Shiite and the ruler is a secularist Sunni that has but down several Shiite religious uprisings). Nothing new to talk about.<br>
<br>
Let me clue in all the clueless &quot;pro-war&quot; people (I assume I can call y'all pro-war since I'm being labeled &quot;anti-war&quot;). Other than the morons on college campuses that are so fucking pathetic in their &quot;need for a cause&quot; that took time out from their vegan neo-hippo anti-capitalism protests to protest this war, there are people out there that had a damn good reason for not supporting this war. Its called international law.<br>
<br>
Now, before all the people whose arguments consist of &quot;we're the toughest, we got all the military might, fuck all of you anti-american bitches, we'll do what we want&quot; drone in with their limp dick based barage of regurgitated Fox news bullshit, let me explain a little thing called reciprocity.<br>
<br>
You see, those international laws and conventions that so many feel the need to dismiss out of hand, are not there to protect the &quot;evil&quot; people, they are not there to protect people like Saddam, they are there to protect you, me, and everyone else on the fucking planet. I know its very easy for someone with a teeny tiny brain to shout outrage at the diplomat that runs over some kid and doesn't get prosecuted, but what you don't seem to understand is that those same laws protect U.S. citizens abroad and U.S. diplomats abroad.<br>
<br>
You see, if we don't follow these laws and conventions, we free everyone else to do the same, and then you get diplomats kidnapped, imprisoned, tortured, and murdered by foreign states. You know, the kind of shit that used to happen 120+ years ago at the onset of any hostilities, problems, whim of someone with enough power, etc. Its kinda like the first amendment here, you know, that little thing that sticks in the side of relgious and nationalistic fascists in this country. We have to let the KKK shout their bullshit, to protect everyone elses rights from the abuses of the state. You know, to prevent a totalitarian regime from developing here.<br>
<br>
And this war, is without that legal basis. Israel is already setting the stage for a full military occupation of the palestinian territories. Russia may decide that they can go invade chechnya. Why not? Hey, the U.S. has set the precedent. Hell, now we have bald threats against Syria, Iran, and North Korea. Senators and representatives calling for similar regime changes in Iran (hey, it was easy enough in Iraq right?), and talking about funneling arms and funds to opposition groups in Syria. Hey! Its 2003 baby! The Soviets are gone and its our time to play! It'll be the 50s and 60s all over, but this time we aren't facing the &quot;red menace&quot;, we're fighting nations whose governments don't play ball. Harbor terrorists? Nah, we won't be attacking Pakistan (their an ally!), we won't be attacking Bangladesh (worthless politically), we won't be attacking Saudi Arabia (too much $$$ at stake), but Iran, Syria maybe, North Korea (just have to make sure they *really* don't have a bomb first), hell, why not go hit Vietnam again! That'll make all those war hawks happy! Time to correct some mistakes!<br>
<br>
Do you know what a patriotic american is? Its a person that values and upholds the american ideals represented in the U.S. Constitution.<br>
<br>
Do you know what a nationalistic american is? Its a person that obsesses about the cultural ideals that are seen as &quot;american&quot; and views other ideals as anathema.<br>
<br>
Do you know what a fascist american is? Its a person that obsesses so much about their personal opinion of what the american ideals are that no other opinion or ideals are allowed.<br>
<br>
I see way to many fucking fascists and nationalists lately on these and other boards and in the press. I've seen way too many cock-waving &quot;arguments&quot; in support of the war, too many self-righteous &quot;moral&quot; arguments in support of the war (yeah, all the sudden morality and human rights come into play, never mind the many other places where there is a lot worse going on), too much bullshit from people with their heads too far up their asses to realize that politics (not oil, not morality, not enforcement, just dirty old fucking politics) are what is really behind this fucking war.<br>
<br>
Yeah, its all about WMD (you know, the ones we gave him and every other third world tyrant that promised not to go red in the 60s and 70s), or its all about saving the Iraqi people. Bullshit. Just like we were after the Taliban for their treatment of women and children? Just like we are after Saudi Arabia for their treatment of women and children? Just like we're after Israel for their treatment of the palestinians? Just like we're after the palestinians for their treatment of the israelis? Just like we're after Russia for their treatment of the Chechnians? Just like we're after China for their treatment of millions and millions in various chinese territories? Just like we were after Chile and Argentina's corrupt governments? Just like we're after the Guatamalan government? Just like we're after the pakistanis and Indians? Just like we're after the Congo? Just like we're after South Africa? Bullshit. Shit happens all over the fucking world, much of it far worse than what went on in Iraq (boo fucking hoo, Saddam's henchman dumped some chemical weapons on some revolutionaries (very little mention of those kurds trying to organize a revolution when people talk about that tragedy, is there?)). So tell me what the fucking difference here is?<br>
<br>
Tell me what is so fucking special about Iraq? Nothing. Not a goddamn thing. The U.S. wants to flex its fucking muscle and insitute democracies across the rest of the world? Fucking do it then, don't fucking use that as a fucking excuse whenever it is convenient, and trample over the authority of the UN to deal with interstate conflicts. Either sack up and fucking take the responsibility and do it, or fucking don't and play by the rules we agreed to.<br>
<br>
Screw all you fucking pansy ass left-wing neo-hippy vegan assfucks and screw all you right wing dickless fucks. You all make me fucking sick. None of you can fucking maintain any sort of fucking standard of policy or behavior. All a bunch of pathetic fucks that think your &quot;morals&quot; means jack shit to everyone else in the fucking world. The fact that people will fucking fawn over *any* politician and act like they are some sort of fucking god disgusts me. Politicians are either rich fucks, war heroes, or activists that have put aside their protesting to suck the dick of ideological compromise, and they are all whores to money and power. Bah, fuck this shit!<br>

How was it illegal?  I'm serious.  I keep seeing this thrown about but have yet to see anyone say what it means.  URLs?  quotes of laws that are being broken, etc. would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
The closest I've seen is folks talking about UN Security Council resolutions but those aren't laws.  In any case, &quot;any means necessary&quot; must mean different things to different people, I guess. The unanimously passed UN Security Council resolutions (including Russia, France, and Germany voting in the affirmative) state this as the methods allowed to insure Iraq (and Saddam Hussain) must comply to the UN decrees.  That they passed at all show that Russia, France, and Germany did not vote &quot;no&quot; to them as they are all permenant members who have veto power. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khelendrose>Khelendrose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/11/03 12:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: Crickets Chirping</span><hr size=1> Abz: Take a closer look at the pictures you are looking at in Iraq.

As for WMD's they are there, and it will take time to find them. Even their own damn scientists are coming out now and saying &quot;Yes, some are still hidden here, and others were sent to Syria&quot; So stop screaming injustice about the WMD's. Iraq has always had them, and was moving them around constantly. When we find them, then what are you going to cry injustice about?<br>

Gwen, actually I disagree about the French president. He is not saying &quot;Doh, better back the winning side&quot; He is going to be first in line trying to get the contracts to &quot;rebuild&quot; the oil industry in France. They just lost Billions of dollars in contracts for oil with Saddam.<br>
<br>
If you can look at the situation in Iraq and say anything other than, &quot;Man, I am glad those people are atleast free for now. Regardless of the rest, we definately did the right thing in freeing them.&quot; Then you need to get a reality check, or a psychiatrist. No matter what your view about this war was, the outcome is clear. A good thing has happened, lets just hope it keeps rolling in the Iraqi's favor. <br>

The focus of the war hasn't changed, IMO people are just surprised by the attitude of the Iraqi people.  They're cheering and dancing on top of Saddam's fallen statue.  That would be why that aspect of victory over Saddam is being stressed so much at this time.<br>
<br>
Also IMO, there were so <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>many</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> reasons to go into Iraq, that you can stress anyone that you choose: the chemical/biological weapons, the oppression of the Iraqi people, their sponsorship of terrorism, their non-compliance with UN resolutions.

<br>

   This about sums it up.  International law is useless.  The only thing good about it was the Geneva Convention where we all decided not to blow up schools and churches and whatnot when we do have war.  I know for a fact though, the second we don't have a right wing / military in this country is the day we arn't free anymore.  Do you really think these dictators like Saddam/Hitler etc. would waste one second questioning our destruction if they knew we would just hold up picket signs and say it's bad?  <br>

Yes, the far right is protecting us all, lol. Since when is &quot;protecting us&quot; equivalent to advocating the removal of rights like freedom of speech? Equivalent to forcing religion in schools? Equivalent to forcing their &quot;morality&quot; based on religious doctrine onto everyone else regardless if those individuals even believe in their religion? Equivalent to being paranoid sociopaths that blame all their children's behavior on &quot;evil influences&quot;? The right wing is full of rich boys obsessed with keeping their rich boy toys, ex-military officers that were too fucking stupid to get promoted further and thus were discharged after continually being passed over for promotion (that's right, the makority of those &quot;military experts&quot; you see on Fox and CNN that had the rank of lt. colonel were losers that were honorably discharged after being passed over for promotion one too many times, as in the U.S. military, you can only be up for rank promotion a specific number of times, after which you must be discharged, its how they prevent the hierarchy from becoming too top-heavy), full of a bunch of middle-class fucks that have been brainwashed by the conservative ideology which tries and make it seem like right wing conservatives are trying to save them money, when the reality is those middle to upper middle class are getting no better tax representation than the lower classes from these fucks, full of a bunch of super-religious fucks that think if they bend over and grease up for the republicans long enough, they'll get their religion shoved down the throat of the rest of the country.<br>
<br>
Left wing liberals are naive idealists sucking their own party line dick, but they at least don't fucking scare the shit out of me. Right wing fucks try over and over to take away the rights specifically reserved for the citizens in the Bill of Rights, and so you can take your &quot;us right wingers are fighting for you&quot; bullshit and shove it up a diseased armadillos ass for what its worth. You are fighting for YOUR MORALITY, you are not fighting to protect anyone's fucking freedoms.<br>
<br>
What is international law? International law is the agreements between states, the treaties they have signed with each other. The UN is an international body that has been *given* - by its member nations - the power to mediate between nations, and the power to forcibly intercede on behalf of the member states with specific member states that are breaking the basic charter rules (UNESCO statement on human rights, for example). In order to keep ultimate power with the sovereign states, actions must be approved my the security council in order to authorize action by the UN.<br>
<br>
That is fucking international law.<br>
<br>
That is what Bush and co. is throwing out the fucking window.<br>
<br>
That is what the fucking problem is.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with fucking Saddam Hussein or any claim of his he isn't going after X weapon. The authority that member nations of the UN have given up to the UN in order to prevent the breakout of another fucking third world war has been fucked with, and as such, there is the fucking precedent of telling the UN to fuck itself. You think China is going to respond to UN action anymore? Do you think Russia is? Any fucking nation with the economic and military power to weather going against such resolutions will do so all the fucking time now.<br>
<br>
Its about biting off our nose to spite our face. The UN was a tool the US used to get what it wanted the majority of the time without having to start a tariff war, get its citizens harassed in foreign states, without having to send its troops everywhere all the fucking time.<br>
<br>
The resolution being cited as authority by the US states simply that Iraq must disarm or that there will be &quot;serious consequences&quot;. That's fucking it. If anyone here can fucking tell me &quot;serious consequences&quot; means forcible removal of the government of a sovereign nation with military action, you are either fucking deluded or a moron.<br>
<br>
Let me do a little logic exercise. No one has presented any evidence that Iraq has WMD. Only a few banned non-WMD weapons had been found (and they were borderline anyway), and they were being destroyed at the time of the invasion. If Bush and co had inviolate proof that Iraq still had these weapons, why didn't they give us that proof? They claimed for the last 18 months that they had that proof, and on at least 3 separate occasions claimed they would show that proof to the UN (once by Bush, once by Blair, once by Powell), and they proceeded to NOT DO SO. So, if you killed someone and went to prison, got out on parole, and then were arrested a year later, and all that was brought against you was, &quot;In the past you have broken the law by murdering someone, now you have to prove you didn't murder someone since then or you will go to prison&quot; what would you fucking think?<br>
<br>
The US will not fucking rebuild Iraq. They won't rebuild Afghanistan. There is no fucking incentive. Oil? Nope. Sure, Cheney is making sure his butt buddies get a few billion on the deal, but this war was never about oil. Its about fucking politics. It is a short sighted unjustified war.<br>
<br>
I'm a fucking patriot. I'm fucking standing up for the constitution and the premises of government contained therewithin. Do I walk around making qualifications about those rights like right wing fucks? Hell no! Do I fucking trample those ethics that we claim sets our form of government apart in dealing with international crises and then saying, &quot;might makes right! fuck off pussies!&quot;? Hell no! You take the fucking good with the bad if you want to keep those rights and keep those protections.<br>

Oh, and joecocksucker, I took my name and email off my sig because my sig was too long for one of the boards I went to, so go back to fucking goats please, and shut the fuck up. Hell, I'll do the same fucking thing I did last year:<br>

Feel free to drop on by joecocksucker, I'd love to put my boot on your neck and stomp your shriveled testicles to try and prevent further spread of your genes. I'm not ashamed of who I am, I'm not afraid of what I believe, I don't stand behind a fucking pseudonym, unlike you.<br>
<br>
You are the worst of the fucking worst, joecocksucker. How anyone can even think to agree with a dumbfuck like you that has professed on these boards that there is more evidence for young earth creationism than evolution is beyond me. Stupidity mystifies me I guess.<br>

How many resolutions were passed by the UN against Saddam and they were never enforced?  To all appearances, Saddam wasn't given the spanking he deserved because he was sitting on a huge ocean of oil.  Human rights violations were being committed daily by him, and no one did anything because it acted against their economic benefits.  To enforce the UN resolutions, several countries would have to act against their personal interests, which it seemed they and Germany and Russia didn't want to do.  Still, the majority of the UN countries were backing the US - it was the ones with economic interests in Iraq which were the ones vehemently against any military action against Saddam.  <br>
<br>
What exactly did the US get out of this?  Oil?  The US could have had that in 1991.  The US doesn't buy much at all of their oil from Iraq, anyway.  Political strength?  Russia, France and Germany allied against the US, so guess not.  Military strength?  I don't see how.  Will it alone get Bush elected for a second term?  It didn't for his dad.  Economic strength?  There might be some money gained back for some American companies in the reconstruction, but weighed against the cost that's gone into the sanctions against Saddam and the war itself, surely it will be marginal.<br>
<br>
The US gets nothing but the safety of American lives, the gratification of seeing Iraqi people dance on Saddam's head, and the seeds of a democracy in what was previously an anti-American state.  Oh yes, those are horribly wicked goals indeed.  <br>
<br>
Your vitriol should be saved for those people who commit true atrocities.  The evil of Saddam was magnitudes greater than anything of which you've accused the coalition.  I hate to use the word evil, it's so melodramatic.  But after seeing the list of what Saddam has done or condoned, it's hard to apply any other word. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frapparatea>frapparatea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/11/03 12:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pfft</span><hr size=1> ya, you're right.

Every country wages war, and many other agendas, for their own benefit.  When the direct product or even byproduct of a war or agenda means fewer people die over time, a tyrant is ousted or dead, torture is ended or minimized, and a population is more free than their culture has experienced for generations...  For many folks that's enough 'justification.'<br>
<br>
People against the war are saying this isn't &quot;liberation.&quot;  Then what is it?<br>
<br>
It sure isn't slavery.<br>
<br>
It sure isn't opression.<br>
<br>
It's the grip of a tyrannical man being broken.<br>
<br>
Abaz, you insinuate your patriotism is greater than the right and the left both?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The US will not fucking rebuild Iraq. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>They</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> won't rebuild Afghanistan.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That 'they' you're talking about....  Should that not be 'us', the United States, your home where Milesburg, PA resides?  Your statements and self-removal from 'them' (The United States) is far from patriotic.  <br>
<br>
Aren't you doing exactly what you're preaching about; by classifying yourself as above both the right and the left?  You are criticizing the patriotism of folks being of a political ideal you don't approve of; yet you separate yourself from the United States when things aren't as you think they should be?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry Abaz, but to me your post cried nothing more than hypocrisies and self-gratification at feeling above two political ideals you obviously (as you stated) detest.<br>
<br>
I'm a firm believer in the Constitution of the United States, but if we didn't have two drastically opposing political parties I don't think the values of the constitution would be realistic in our daily lives.  The left enforces some of those constitutional values, the right enforces some of those constitutional values.  Combined those values make the United States of America which, despite your opinion, upholds and believes in all values of the Constitution of which we as a country were created. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.thegeekhost.com/musician1993/Nov02.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74894" target="top">Gwenwyvar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> ~ <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.frayedknot.net" target="top">Frayed Knot</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=abazagaroth>Abazagaroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/11/03 1:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.modernhumanorigins.com/images/webring.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pfft</span><hr size=1> No, &quot;they&quot; as in the U.S. government.<br>

What makes you think that everyone who believes that the war in Iraq was justified and a good thing is a right wing extremist trying to shove religion down your throat?<br>
<br>
I think you have a lot of anger stemming from something to do with religion. Did you get fucked by a priest as a child? I wouldn't doubt it.<br>
<br>
Thing is, the bastard was ordering the murder of innocents. In my book that is grounds for an ass kicking no matter how big your guns are. <br>
<br>
As for the other tyrant leaders in the world today, they';re on the list too, but hey if someone put five cages in front of you and said open the doors and free the monkeys inside, but yo if you open the one in the middle first I'll give you $2000.00. I bet you would open the one in the middle first. It's not rocket science.<br>
<br>
Not everyone bases their morality on religeon. I happen to think religeon is all bull-shit, but I know for a fact that the morals that are written in religeous texts stem from human feelings about what should and should not be the proper treatment of your fellow human beings.<br>
Something I am sure you aren't familiar with judging by your willingness to step on someone's neck.<br>
<br>
You are a worthless waste of human skin, if you like your freedom so much I know about 800 miles of ocean that you can occupy. It's lawless and free and you can do whatever the fuck you want there, should be right up your alley.<br>
