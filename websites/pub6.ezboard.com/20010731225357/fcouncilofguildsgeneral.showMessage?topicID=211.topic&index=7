To me, dragon raids and planes raids as they are in EQ isn't really (or shouldn't be) about the LEWTZ anyway. Lewtz, items, they are all just gravy. The fun of taking down a tough target, of having a battle that you just barely scrape through, THAT'S fun to me. Just mindlessly killing the same looking mobs over and over again hoping that the &quot;Stick of Insect Bashing&quot; or the &quot;Robe of Unholy Mooning&quot; will drop isn't fun, it's repetitive. Something I've always argued for in the KGC is doing the planes and other big targets for FUN and Challenge, not for equipping yourself with full planar armour, oh and the other 95 people in the guild as well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  No offense meant to those who do this, but it isn't and shouldn't be what the game is about. However, to many people, that is all that killing dragons and raiding planes do. If that's what you like, fine for you, but it ain't what I like, and it ain't what I feel the CoG should be doing. <br>
<br>
So what if someone comes to a dragon raid and gets two pieces with two different raids? Big deal... did you have fun? Was the rush of blasting or bashing that dragon diminished in anyway? If it was, you probably don't need to go on a dragon raid, because you'd get better lewtz easier in places like Sebilis, some of the Velious dungeons, etc. AND you'd have a better chance, because you'd be rolling against less people. Honestly, from seeing the &quot;high-end&quot; loot coming out of Velious, once you get to a certain level of equipment, you CAN'T get any better... there just isn't any loot better than some pieces. SO then what? Once you have complete Dragon (Velious) or Kael quest armour, primal and/or epic weapons, then what? <br>
<br>
I'm rambling too, but my point is that once you boil down dragons and planes and other raids to the lewt, the fun factor goes WAY down. Keep it fun, keep it challenging, keep it real. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And generally one that I agree on.  However, part of the problem is that &quot;fun&quot; really isny quantatative.  I cant go to my friend and show him all the fun I had last night.  Especially when they look at me and say, &quot;wow, and all I got was a cobalt bracer and heirophant cloak.&quot;  Lewt is part of &quot;keeping score&quot; and however immature and infantile it may be, thats still part of human nature.  We're all competative at some level.  Then there's always the point that getting the good equipment actually keeps you alive and helps ensure that you do contribute to the group besides just adding to their ping times.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying your wrong, in fact the fun of a raid used to be the only reason I tended to go on these things.  However, even I have to admit its begining to pall on me.  Spending upwards of 4 hours helping to organize and put together a raid, spending 6 nail biting hours getting them to DN and setup and running and trying to keep them alive, then another hour at 2am porting them all out can get tiring when you never get anything.  Perhaps its just burn out talking, but there is only so much fun you can have before it becomes more of the same.  After all, going to DN still is fun, but I dont go there anymore for the fun of it.  I go because friends ask me to, because I'm needed for some reason, and because there is always the possibility I might win a drop.  But fun?  Hardly.  Fun has become more of a by product rather than a reason in and of itself.<br>
<br>
In the end, at least in EQ, I think we're fooling ourselves if we think that fun can be an end all.  Its not, anymore than the phat lewt or level60 is.  They're all part of the same and as such have equal parts in the sum of the whole.  That means that we do need to take the phat lewtz into consideration when looking at double dipping in my opinion.  Especially on things like Dragon Raids.  Sure, that level 53+ support group makes things easier.  But thats 6 more people to roll against.  And really, they can only help buff and maybe clear.  For most people on the raid they have maybe 2 or 3 chances against each dragon, maybe, before they hit the level limit and probably never see the dragons again.  Is it fair to them?  I dunno.  <br>
<br>
I can also see it as being discouraging to other players as well.  Here you are, from a small guild and CoG is the only way you'll ever see a plane with members of your guild.  But you cant win anything because half the people you're rolling against are from planes capable guilds who are double dipping.  I can see people in that situation either giving up or switching guilds, neither of which are a good thing generally.  Now I would agree that we can ban double dippers from rolling, thats just not right.  Nor can we even run some of these raids without them half the time.  Which brings me to a new point.<br>
<br>
Is CoG really still viable?  Or have we simply become a second chance for people to get more phat lewtz while under the disguise of helping others?  If people think that we are still viable then I think we need to take a hard look at ourselves.  In point of fact, I suggest the next dragon raid have absolutely no double dippers and no 53+'s.  If we cant do it without them then I dont see how in the end CoG will be able to continue to do these raids and maintain standing in KGC.  Because if they do get upset enough about it they'll simply reinstate the ban on double dipping there.  Now as far as is KGC right or wrong in their idea of double dipping?  Who knows, I think its sorta irrelevant since there's nothing any of us can do to change it.  We can either abide by it, or really find a new server.  Perhaps it is possible to change it, but we wont be able to until CoG proves it really doesnt need the double dippers.  You cannot negotiate from a position of weakness and expect to be taken seriously, and however unfair it may be, you cannot suggest changes when you're the new kid on the block.<br>

There is plenty of double-dipping going on outside of CoG ... <br>
<br>
The only reason why CoG is more likely to get &quot;punished&quot; or judged for it because they / we are the only ones being completely open about our policies and procedures, with the inner workings for everyone to see. Honesty always comes with a price to pay.<br>

People only have what power others choose to give them.  KGC doesnt have any more enforcement powers than CoG.  However, to not abide by KGC is to return to chaos and anarchy.  Dunno, but I really wouldnt want to see that happen.<br>
<br>
Also I'd think it'd be easier to &quot;punish&quot; CoG than say AoVB or CoK.  KGC guilds dont have much to do with the smaller CoG guilds and probably dont care much one way or another.  They do have friends and stuff in many of the other alliances.  Plus those other alliances are a force to be reckoned with.  If they decide to break with KGC it could all come apart.  Can you really see CoG trying to KS Vox?  I doubt we could even if we tried.  Still, it's almost be worth the admission price to see something like that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I like to think I say things to make people think, and play Devil’s Advocate.<br>
<br>
I understand how you feel and the way you think Haemish.  Having fun in the game should come first.  Otherwise why play the game?  But let me point out a couple things.  First, the idea of “fun” differs from person to person.  Some may have fun by chatting with friends, or grouped with buddies taking on tough targets.  Others may have fun exploring the world, and others have fun finding new items.  And yet others have fun by getting phat lewtz.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I still think having fun in the game should come first.  But I also think that the items do come into play in having fun.  For me it is not fun to be under equipped at a large raid, dying constantly and being a drain on the raid’s resources.  Thus, I need items to have fun.  Even the CoG’s loot rules mirror this train of thought.  Example, the Cloak of Flames.  Only melees can roll on it.  Why?  So they can be stronger the next time the CoG takes on another large target.  Is it really fun to resurrect dozens of people at the end of the raid?  But knowing we only had 5 deaths on the raid is exhilarating.  <br>
<br>
In all this, I just wanted to point out that the lewt is part of the equation that equals fun.  What the rest of the equation is, I don’t really know.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I think my biggest peeve about lewtz, and the biggest reason I want the CoG not only to not focus on them, but also to promote fun outside of them, is that of all the things people argue about in EQ, that causes the most conflict at the higher levels, is lewtz. I've seen guilds tear themselves apart (and I mean big and small) and friendships trashed over arguments about lewtz. If I could pick any single thing that hinders the growth of the MMORPG community in Everquest, it would be the need for lewtz that the EQ engine places on a character's effectiveness. Granted, it's a math game, but the math game is often more important than the tactics (i.e. see the levels requirements for Kunark dragons, the math gimmicks of rune on Venril Sathir raids). Items are all too often so self-oriented that people get downright backstabby over them. It hurts the community, IMNSHO, because it gives that nasty side of human nature, self-interest, free reign. ENLIGHTENED self-interest, means you want things for yourself, but you aren't willing to bury your dagger in someone else's back, and you ARE willing to give up something for yourself in the hopes that others will follow your example. <br>
<br>
To me, focusing on items turns this into fantasy Quake Deathmatch with everyone fighting over powerups. That's fun for Quake... it ain't why I play EQ. <br>

<br>
Sorry I was getting the feeling this was getting a tad bit too serious.<br>
<br>
But once again on a more serious note, I would have to say I'm not terribly impressed by Ash or AoVB.  More to the point...Ash who?  I had to think on this one hard, but I dont think I've ever grouped with anyone from them.  Could someone please refresh me as to who's in them?  AoVB.  Ummm...oh yeah the people I argued for 15 minutes with on our last VoX raid for 1 lvl49 enchanter who has been one of my best EQ friends for over a year because of double dipping concerns.  In fact that was a major I removed my application to The Haven.  (kay I wasnt actively pursuring it but...)  I'm certainly not joining any guild/alliance that will put restrictions on who I personally can help.  Now if I were asking for all of The Haven, that would've been something else.  But c'mon, 1 alliance member that we desperately needed that was a longtime personal friend?<br>
<br>
As I said before, fun is fun.  But Zatriz has the point that loot does also help in the fun as well.  And is it fun putting your xp on the line when you know that someone who isnt doing more than buffing is going to roll with you?  Or that the person next to you is going to go up against Vox next week with their own guild, but you may never see that dragon again due to the level limits?  Well, perhaps its irrelevent.  Perhaps for most people the dragons happen so rarely that it never stops being fun regardless.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder?  Hmmm.  All I can say about fun is, ask your guild who wants to explore DN.  After everyone says sure lets do it, tell them you're going to run through SG since you dont have a high level druid/wizard.  See how many are willing to go still.  Those are probably the ones who are in it for the fun.  My experience is that the numbers will be fewer than you think.<br>
<br>
Oh well.  Just a few more random thoughts early from work before the caffiene kicked in.<br>
