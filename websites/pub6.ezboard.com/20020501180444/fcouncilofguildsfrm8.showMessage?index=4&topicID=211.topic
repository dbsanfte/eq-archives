Let me just say - sorry.  Was my first time calling the loot - and I'm sure I could have done better.  With that said let me clear up 3 items.<br>
<br>
1) Raid loot was declared to start at the FIRE GIANTS.  Any loot dropped prior to King Tranix was not part of the raid.   Please refer to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessage?topicID=139.topic">pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncil...=139.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> for any questions on this.  So while the Stone Spider was killed multiple times (I saw 2 at least and pretty sure there were 3 - it didn't count - and I wasn't tracking it nor responsible for it)<br>
<br>
2) About the re-roll.  SORRY.  I felt that my /shouts weren't clear enough about the steps and I felt that it was confusion and NOT someone just rolling early for the hell of it.  Besides both of her rolls where higher then anyone elses.<br>
<br>
3) About the 'Break' incident.  Its VERY hard with 60 or so random people on a raid to be possitive who's there and who's not, who participated, and who didn't.  Add to the fact all the chaos and massive amounts of people just not following directions and well these things happen.<br>
<br>
If you felt cheated by anything on my part - sorry.  But I wasn't in a roll to be liked last night - I was handing out loot.  I had 7 people love me and 60 or more think I was an arse.  Hey, just look at the bright side - one less dragon in the world <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6149">Tsaryn

I would raid with you guys anywhere any time. That being said there were a few incidents that occurred which my self and many others felt were out of line and needed to be addressed. That was the point of my post, to raise concerns over a few, a very few, incidents it what was otherwise a great raid. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your clear and concise response Tsaryn. As to your point #2, I consider this answered for and a dead issue. You really did do a great job as loot master and your explanation Hoe the roll in question was handled is pretty much as I thought it would be but enough people said something to me that I felt the issue should be raised.<br>
<br>
As to your point #1 (and my point #3), I have reread the loot rules and understand where the Idea that only loot from Naggy and the fire giants would be considered raid loot and rolled on came from. That having been said I think the problem arose because on the last vox raid I was on with KCoG (raid before last) the prickly pear dropped and was looted among the SKs that were there. In order to be consistent I think in the future either the same should be done with the orb or neither Item should be rolled on. I consider this a dead issue in terms of what happened at the raid. As you state it was not part of the raid loot according to the rules and therefore was not rolled on. Case closed. I do think we should discuss whether or not in the future this or similar types of items should be included and would like to see others constructive thoughts on this. Here is what I have to say. Let me say that I honestly couldn't tell you 10% of what drops of Naggy and vox and the various mobs on the way to their respective lairs. I don’t go on Dragon raids for the loot and if something drops that I can use then I will find out then and there what it is. I’m not going to bother looking for items specifically for me for these types of raids, as I know my chances of winning something are very small. That having been said, in this case it seems to me that this item is the type of thing that should be rolled on. It is for a single class and it is an item needed to complete a quest to get an awesome (I am told) spell that every member of the class in question would want. KCoG was formed to, among other things, give people who belonged to smaller guilds a chance to experience things and complete quests that they would not otherwise be able to do without joining am Uber guild. It seems to me then that this is the type of thing that should be rolled on, current rules not with standing. This is something that should be discussed not just for this item but any other items of a similar nature; quest items for a specific class or class that drop off mobs other than fire giants or the dragons themselves. I’m not the best person to lead this discussion because, as I said, I have no clue as to what other items might be of a similar nature on these raids.<br>
<br>
As to your point #3. I know all to well how difficult it can be to keep track of people on a raid.  I do know that one of the groups were told to invite Break by Azure as we were getting ready to go thru the buff line. Again, I know how easy it is to lose track or not realize whether or not someone had been there the whole time. The perception of many at the raid, not just myself or guild mates, was that Break had shown up literally at the last minute of a 6 hour raid and was allowed to participate and roll on items while others who I know shoed up at the druid ring some 30 to 45 minutes late, maybe a little later, but before we had moved off to the SolB, were turned away. I think Azure is the only one who can answer this question. Did you realize that Break had not been there the whole time? If you had not then that is answer enough for me. If you did know that he had shown up at the last minute, why was he allowed to participate? I believe this needs yet to be answered and I think Azure is the only one who can do it.<br>
<br>
You did not address my point #4 but as loot master not raid leader you weren’t involved and I would not expect an answer from you on this point.<br>
<br>
Again Tsaryn, thanks again for your thoughtful response to these issues being raised. My post was not meant to be an attack on you or Azure but rather was meant to raise some issues with a few isolated incidents in what was otherwise a great raid. Thank you for taking it in the spirit it was meant. I in no way felt cheated by these incidents but they did raise eyebrows among a large number of the raid members present and I felt they should be addressed thank you for taking the time to do so and I look forward to many more raids with Azure leading us and yourself or whomever else she designates as loot master calling the rolls.<br>
<br>
Lastly. I’d like to congratulate Sevlor for being the first one to bring a flame to this thread. I brought up legitimate issues in (hopefully) a non-inflammatory manner so it could be discussed like adults. If you wish to rant and call people names, take it elsewhere please as it has no place on this board. I will address your post more completely in a separate post, as I would not care to further tarnish this post and Tsaryn’s well worded post to which it replies.<br>

<br>
Your concerns:<br>
<br>
#1-I believed Tsaryn answered this for you.<br>
<br>
#2- If our groups are full, I will turn people away. I have had many times in the past had people join the raid late. If there is space and they bring no harm to the raid, I feel that every person is an asset.<br>
<br>
I am a trusting person. I dont judge people. I try to be fair. A monk asks if we have room, says he's lvl 52 (I later found out he was 53). I found him a group. NO ONE said...&quot;hey do you know about this guy...?&quot; I dont hang out in EC's. I dont have a rap sheet of all the dishonorable people on our server. I dont read all the flames on the EQ forums. It wasnt till after he rolled and won loot (which btw I never saw his roll) did all this come out in the open. Once something has been won and awarded, I will NOT take the item back.<br>
<br>
Was this a bad judgement call on my part? Yes, this time it was. I'm human.<br>
<br>
#3-As Tsaryn said loot begins with the FG's and is posted on this forum (not that everyone reads them). I would like to add that we generally respect other people's camps and loot. The Stone Spiders is a recognized camp in SolB. Although it wasnt camped last night, in the past it has been. That is why those drops are not accounted for.<br>
<br>
EDIT- seems I was still writing while Falcone was posting. I will review the loot policy on the prickly pear and the orb. Thanks for your imput. /END EDIT<br>
<br>
#4-Willowood went LD a few times at the druid ring. We waited but I made the call to go ahead and go in. I never recieved another tell about if she had come back online or not.<br>
<br>
I knew we had a GL and a corpse at the entrance. It is not the GL repsonsibilty to go back for a person or corpse. Especially not a healer. Why we have a Support team. Why we have a rogue who can pull corpses safely. I did try on a few occasions to send someone back to get them. When I finally realized they had not been brought back.. it was too late to do it safely. I was also made aware of some &quot;personal&quot; problems in that particular group, after it was too late to re arrange groups.<br>
<br>
Basically it comes down to lack of communication and misinformation. Which there was ALOT of last night.<br>
<br>
I had way more tells than I usually have, too much /ooc complaining, tells from my support team that people are wandering or trying to jump my authority, and plain not listening.<br>
<br>
Last night was not a typical KCoG raid. And I felt bad for those who were first time raiders with us. Not a very good example of what this organization is all about.<br>

I asked for meaningful discussion of issues that were brought to my attention by a large number of the raiding party not just myself and guild mates and you bring flames, insults and swearing.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;Is it that hard to feel happy for someone else winning an item? Are you so quick to declare a mis-trial that you don't even realize that we are all on the same side? &gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
It is not hard at all. I congratulated each and every winner. No one, least of all me declared a mistrial. Questions were raised as to how things were handled and a large number of people felt those issues should be addressed. Yes I do realize we are all on the same side. My GL Destructress is now leading planes raids for KCoG and as a member of that guild all of our guild members present felt these were legitimate issues that should be raised so as to avoid similar problems on future KCoG raids. We are trying to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. <br>
<br>
&lt;Someone misrolled, and you bastards took to her like a pack of bloodthirsty wolves. &gt;<br>
<br>
Yes someone did miss roll. As I have rechecked my logs it seems that many people were questioning the loot master as to why this person was not disqualified. This is not how it should have been handled (the questioning as well as the roll) IMHO but if you go back and check your logs you will see that I said nothing at the time. That was not the appropriate place to raise the issue. This message board is. Is it really necessary to call people bastards and bloodthirsty wolves to try and get your point across? <br>
<br>
&lt;And you, as the ultimate authority of what is &quot;bleeding&quot; and what is not, decide to tell someone who bled and died at this raid that they didn't deserve an item that they fairly won? &gt;<br>
<br>
Edit<br>
much of what occurred with the whole pslyth and Willowood situation was presented to me second hand and after the raid had ended. If I have stated something incorrectly, and it appears from Azures post that I have as she has stated she didnt know that Pslyth had benn left behind until it was too late, then I apologize for any misinformation on my part.<br>
/end edit<br>
Break was allowed to join the raid at the last possible minute while 2 other members of the raiding party were left sitting at the zone line as they were instructed to wait there by the raid leader. These 2 people were on time and one was a designated group leader. It has nothing to do with bleeding it has to do with showing up on time and participating in the whole raid. It is generally the rule that people who show up late don’t participate. This rule seems to have been overlooked in this case and many people want to know why. As Azure has not had a chance to respond I reserve judgment. I suggest you do the same.<br>
<br>
&lt;Pathetic, that's what you are. Every one of you that because you felt insecure about you tiny little rolls, had to attack your FELLOW raiders. Every one of you don't deserve the effort that Azure made to make this raid work. You don't fricking deserve it. You don't deserve to have seen a level 55 dragon fall to your feet. I mean why don't you just ninja loot it next time, if that's all you are there for. <br>
<br>
Really Really pathetic. Next time, look at yourselves before you make asses.&gt;<br>
<br>
I don’t feel that raising legitimate issues in a thoughtful (hopefully) non-inflammatory manner to be pathetic. As I stated in my first post this is not about loot it is about rules and consistency of their enforcement. Meaningful discussion has always been a part of KCoG and it is in that spirit that I raised these issues. As a member of the guild that is now leading the KCoG planes raids, we understand all too well the massive amount of effort that goes into the planning and conducting of these raids. We have taken a long look at ourselves and a large portion of why these issues were brought up was so as to avoid these problems in the future as much as is humanly possible.<br>
<br>
As far as I am concerned this type of flame is not needed here. If you can’t express yourself without resorting to flames, name-calling, and swearing, please don’t do so at all.<br>
<br>
From Cheynar's post<br>
&lt;I would also like to defend the person that was said to roll early. Mistakes are made! I know this person pretty good and know for a fact that they are not out there to rip anyone off and that they will probably never make that mistake again but to see how they were FLAMED made me sick. Tsaryn was doing the loot and made a command decision to accept the roll (they were chosen to this position for a reason) I do not feel that the alliance was damaged by the decision that was made. &gt;<br>
<br>
This person needs no defending. Mistakes do get made. Any gripe others or I had was with how it was handled not with the person in question. Maybe others did flame the roller. If they did it was out of line. As I said above, I said nothing at the time. Tsaryn made a command decision and I accepted it. The decision did, in my mind and others, raise issues. That’s why I brought them here where they belong. I agree the alliance was not damaged but at the same time these are real issues that many felt needed to be addressed. As a long time member of the community and as an officer of the guild now leading planes raids, I felt these issues needed to be raised and discussed.

<br>
If you feel you need to respond to it, then wonderful. I was embarrassed to be along side of some of the loot-hungry people who chose to not respect the authority that was there. <br>
<br>
I am sorry I didn't sweeten up my post, for this forum. I guess I should next time, but there is a point in my agressiveness. <br>
<br>
My point may be wasted here, I'll move on.<br>

Likewise there is no need for flaming. Your post wasn't agressive, it was rude and full of name calling and swearing. Such is not the stuff of meaningful debate.

I clearly stated that raising such issues should not take place in an open channel during the raid, they should, as Kommisar said, be channeled thru the group leaders and then to the raid leader in private. I did not and would not do so. That is why I brought the issues here. I know some people did. Kcarcreve for one did question in ooc how the roll was handled. If you read his post (oneye above) he apologized for doing so as he too realizes that that is not where the issue should be handled and therefore apologized for his actions. And thank you for not flaming. at least now we are having meaningful discussion, which is why I posted here in the first place. The raid leadership should always be respected. If you feel they are handling things wrong then one should give them a tell or bring it to this forum. I know if I feel that a raid is being handled poorly then I will just remove myself from the situation. Arguing or backtalking to the leader ship in public channels is not the way to handle the situation. <p>Falcone Robinsbane<BR>

I know that I didn't know it was an SK quest item (whereas I did know the prickly pear was), when I was running dragon raids. It's actually the first time I've heard of this item. It could very well be that most including the loot master just didn't know the item was a quest item. That's happened with other items on raids I've run (amygdylan whips being part of the Bard Epic quest in Plane of Fear is one example). <br>
<br>
Azure, I appreciate the pain and effort it takes to run these, especially when you have a bunch of monkeyspanks disrupting the whole thing.

<br>
I would like to thank all the Raiders that didn?t say anything, that didn?t spam OOC or Shouts, I would like to thank the people that didn?t send tons of Tells to the people running this event, I would like to thank the people that following the instructions and that did what they where told with out question for the good of the raid. To the rest of you 50 people &lt;Rude&gt;<br>
<br>
Imagine if you will you are a teacher in a kindergarten with 50 little kids running around, pulling at your pants, shouts, trying to talk to you. 60% is crap but little Timmy needs to go to the wash room. He is being a good little boy and is asking the Teacher but the poor teacher is flooded with problems, Jill and Sam are trying to Eat the gold fish, Chuck is screaming into Anna?s ear, Anna is of course crying like a baby, Jake is pulling at the Teachers pants trying to get you to make Billy give him his fire truck back. Yohos The none English speaking Student just let mister Bun Bun out of his Cage and he is running over the paint that Stu dropped only seconds ago because he wanted to paint when Painting time is not until after nap time. Tom is napping? On Allen?s head, with makes you wonder if he can even breath. <br>
<br>
Now the question is? what does Timmy want?<br>
<br>
The point is. The more Crap fills the lines of communication the more is lost. Having to shout to get people to move their asses and stand in the right place or do the right thing, to tell people not to do something. To get tells with Suggestions and problems, Whining, complaining and so on. Fill the lines of Communication up with non-important stuff and the important stuff is lost. In the case of the people at the zone, Break and so on. <br>
<br>
You think you can do better? Then do it. You run a Raid. People like you are the reason I stopped helping run CoG raids so many moons ago. <br>
<br>
Everyone thinks they know everything so much better, and can do it the ?right? way. But none of you every put your money where your mouth is. It?s always good and honest people that step up and give you all the chance to do something great and everytime you drain the life from them, With your whining and complaining. But then you don?t care as long as someone does it for you and you can get the loot. &lt;Shake head&gt;<br>

Thats fine - I'll take the blame.  It was my first time and I can already think of tons of things I'd do better or different.  <br>
<br>
Like I mentioned in my previous post - a list of items that the raid leader was was responsible for was put out prior to the raid - I did my best to adhear to this - i.e. leaving the Stone Spider spawns FFA.  Was that the best choice - given the chaos and issues raised AFTER - probably not.  But I didn't know it that at the start of the raid.<br>
<br>
Maybe I should have disqualified the one roller that /random'd early - but I felt that given the circumstances - my /shouts weren't as concise and clear as they could have been.  I didn't want to penalize anyone for my n00bie-izm at loot master.<br>
<br>
I'm thick skinned and believe it or not - LEARN from my mistakes, so feel free to throw flack or suggestions - I'll listen. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6149">Tsaryn
