You can't rely on anything this early in the game, in early beta archers were so very weak so they gave them huge bonuses, and forgot about them.  Now they're balanced again.<br>

The best exp is a group of like three or four people fighting mobs that assist each other and con yellow to orange to you.  Group bonus exp is where it's at.  Just find a few groups that aren't too far from each other and rotate between them so that you keep the anti-camp bonus exp up.  A constant stream of yellow mobs will end up being a heck of a lot better exp wise than one red or purple mob, and then a lot of downtime.  It's just like EQ in that respect; you can kill three blues that give 1/2 the exp of a yellow in the time it takes to kill 2 yellows so you net more exp over time even though the exp per kill is quite a bit less.  It's all about volume.  =)<br>
<br>
As for soloing power, of lack thereof, try a Nightshade sometime...  blue con mobs own me unless I am really specific about what types I kill so that I always have a significant advantage.  About the only things I can reliably solo are caster mobs since they can't cast if you are meleeing them and they have essentially zero hps.  Now, if you take two Nightshades and partner them, that's when it gets fun.  My roommate and I were playing our Nightshades and instantly killing the mobs when we pulled them.  He pulled with our crappy DD line, hid before it got to him, then hit it with perforate artery and I hit it with backstab 2.  Only the higher level ones survived long enough for us to actually have to melee 'em. <p>Sbik Swashbucklugget<br>

<br>
Tryst is my main, a lv17 elven Champion. I have only good things to say about this class in PvE (dunno how she is going to go in RvR). I've gone Valor/Slash/Shield/Parry and this combo (in that order of importance) allows me to comfortably solo all blues and a lot of yellows without any difficulty. <br>
<br>
I'm also playing a lv7 Thane, and so far this is a pretty good class but I must say that I've died quite a number of times to yellows so I'm putting the infant Thane in the only fight blue category.<br>
<br>
I've got a lv7 Paladin and I am disappointed in this class. I can't solo very well and even some blues own me. Perhaps the class improves at higher levels...but really I'm not holding out much hope.<br>
<br>
I also have a baby (lv5) eldritch specialising in void magic...the change of playstyle is fun, but I'm more into playing hybrids so my eldritch only comes out for a session once in a blue moon.<br>
<br>
With all my hybrids I've gone in order of importance:<br>
1. Spellcasting (valor/stormcalling/chants)<br>
2. Weaponskill (slash/hammer)<br>
3. Shieldskill<br>
4. Parry<br>
<br>
These seem to work pretty well.<br>

Archers did suck some serious ass when they were first introduced, the dmg bonus was nice, but originally they bumped it too strong so it had to be toned down (1 hitting orange and red mobs was a bti much) to the point that we all know and love, and to be honest I really thought they were fine, I played a hunter through beta and he out damaged my runemaster, but when DAoC went live I still went with my runemaster (see hunter's aren't all that uber).  Now as a theurg I get owned by rangers and hunters on a daily basis, but it doesn't bug me since why should I expect a lone caster to survive against a sniper?  Too many people bitch now that they switched over from EQ.<br>
I have to say though even though they fixed it now I did love that bug where I could debuff a mob and not get resisted no matter what lvl it was and basically make a totally unhittable mob ownable for my groups with dex debuffs, yeah I guess you could say thats over powering.<br>
Really don't know about the enchanter thing, I was 2 and 0 vs them in RvR so honestly their pet couldn't have been too over powering, shoot when they introduced theurgs as they are now everyone cried nerf and vowed never to play the class, now look at them, they are near manditory on raids due to their anti archer abilities and slowing abilities (think shaman with more versatility than just turgor's and light healing in group raids).<br>
can't remember what I was supposed to be talking about so.<br>

The spells and styles at that point are a huge upgrade.  After that I was able to yellows very easily.<br>
<br>
In DAoC pallies are great soloers.  Before level 15 I would advise sticking with sword and shield for the greater defense.  All melees seem to have problems at levels seven and eight.  I think it is a matter of choosing the right mobs to level off of.  At level seven I would recommend bandits in Camelot hills.  If the blue bandits are still a problem then just get past the level slaughtering a ton of greens.  <br>
<br>
I try to stick to blues or just the right yellows for exp grind.  As a paladin I can kill blues almost non-stop, don't even need to use a single style and end the fight with almost full health since I use the healing chant.  Hell even greens would be your best  bet for strict exp grind if you can kill them non-stop and can find a good source of them.  As a matter of fact if you are melee and are strictly leveling off of yellows or better solo you are going to find yourself broke at some point.  Melees solo far better in orange or yellow armor, and that takes a lot of cash. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usorarnancient.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorarn Ancient</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Sap</span><br>  Posts: 894<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/19/01 10:21:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enchanter DOWN</span><hr size=1> I like my Blademaster ^.^<br>

Everyone was complaining about sniper RvR...so they nerfed archer PvE...that makes sence....NOT.<br>

Before hunters were a solid solo class(not good in group play...not enough damage output).<br>
<br>
<br>
But now soloing is hard. miss rate has gone through the roof..and it is just dang hard to be an archer right now. They really did screw with the class. It was not enough that I could spend 30-50 gold a night on arrows....but now soloing blues are a risky prospect.<br>

I am kinda disappointed with the way they tuned the archers when it was only PvP from purples on grays that was the problem.....<br>
