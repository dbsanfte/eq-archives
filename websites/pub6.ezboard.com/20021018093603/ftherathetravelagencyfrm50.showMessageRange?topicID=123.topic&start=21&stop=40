That is why we overlooked the case where some guild might actually only want to farm those two mobs.  It simply didn't occur to us that anyone would want to do that because it was not aligned with any of our goals (first BotS, then SoT, then Tindi/NB).<br>
<br>
If I had stated my opinion on the matter, it would have been of the form:  Ikatair and Eashen aren't worth fooling with, they are simply in the way of getting to Aaryonyar.  90% of their loots suck and I can't figure out why anyone would want to kill them and not advance straight on into ToVN. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugranitfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Granitfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 8:26:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> Its not a matter of wanting to farm those two.....it was a matter of maybe thats all you are capable of doing.<br>
<br>
Some guilds may never have the power to clear NToV, but some guilds already have the power to kill Ikatair and Eashen.  <br>
<br>
The whole point of my argument was the fact that those guilds that are capable of doing Eashen and Ikatair were told that killing just those two dragons would be &quot;a bad thing&quot; and that they were NOT allowed to kill just those two.  <br>
<br>
Its really not that hard to figure out, some guilds can do those 2 and not NToV.  Sooooooooo why not kill them and leave NToV for the guilds who are capable of that and when you are ready then move onto that?<br>
<br>
As far as loot goes, everyone knows that BoTS are the best equiped guild on the server and some of your members wear gear off those 2.  So why not try and farm them for what they have?<br>
<br>
All I was doing here is asking......If you are capable of killing those two mobs why are you told that you can not?  NOT on a rotation but hey if your in the neighborhood........ <p><center><BR><font color= Blue><BR><i>Granitfist/Jeribu<i/><BR><i>GrandMaster/High Priest<i/><BR><i>Co-Leader of Circles End<i/><BR><i>The Rathe<BR><center><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370733">The Monk </> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370756">The Cleric<i/>

<br>
<br>
Because those mobs are in N ToV and part of the rotation.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Using  your logic you should add Dagarn, Feshlak, Lord Koi'Dokken, Lady Mirenella, Lord Kriez, Jorleag, and Cekenar to the list of mobs that &quot;guilds can kill but not kill Aaryonar&quot;.  If you can kill Gozzrem fairly easily, and can clear the Rampage Wyverns to get to Ikky, then you can kill all of the above dragons.  However, just like Ikky and Eashen, they both lie beyond the N ToV door, and are part of the rotation covered by N ToV on the RTA Rotation list. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

<br>
it should not be that time investing karadin.<br>
<br>
I might be wrong, my knowledge of NTOV is pretty little. but  if i remember well, there is a way to go to roy and fight him without aggroing/killing eashen and iki (and without coh) Correct me if i am wrong.<br>
<br>
Killing rampage wyverns could be long yes, especially for the new guilds going there. But dont tell me you spend hours to clear the hub and the rampage wyv, i would not trust you.<br>
<br>
Gromm, you are saying that objectives were never eashen and iki for the guilds that went to ntov. THat doesnt mean it has ALWAYS to be the case. I know that VOF isnt too far from being able to kill eashen and iki. (not saying that we will kill them tomorrow, but it will come) But i also know that we are far from being able to kill roy. and that would be the reason that we cant kill them? it is pretty unfair.<br>
<br>
No offense guys, but i only see you trying to not get these new rotation entities because you would have to go to TOV 2 times instead of one. You aren't trying at all to be fair to other lil guilds.<br>
<br>
Of course, the problem isnt a problem for now, noone killed them. but i am curious what will happen when they will be killed by a guild, and honestly, i am not a VOF rep and dont take decisions, but i strongly hope that when we will have the occasion, we will kill them.  <p><center><b><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=156296">Malaka's Profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugranitfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Granitfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 9:04:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=25>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> Karadin I understand that they are &quot;in the NToV section&quot; and that they are covered by the RTA, maybe thats why no one has attempted them?

<br>
That is the real issue here.  Is change that bad?  Its not like this would hinder or interrupt your turn at NToV past Aaryonyar would it?  If it does could you please explain how it would?  By making those 2 dragons FCFS it shouldn't hinder any of the big 3 would it?  If they are up when you go to do NToV you kill them and keep going, if they are not you continue on to the rest of NToV.<br>
<br>
Can you all allow people to kill those two dragons but keep the rule that you only get added to the NToV rotation by proving you can kill Aaryonyar? <p><center><BR><font color= Blue><BR><i>Granitfist/Jeribu<i/><BR><i>GrandMaster/High Priest<i/><BR><i>Co-Leader of Circles End<i/><BR><i>The Rathe<BR><center><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370733">The Monk </> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370756">The Cleric<i/>

Your argument started with this stance made us hate smaller guilds or something.  I stated history.  Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492.  This means that I think anyone under level 50 should be banned from the server I guess.  The Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776.  This means that any guild with under 50 players in it should be disbanned.  The USA entered World War 2 in 1941.  This means that everyone who plays a druid should delete their toon.<br>
<br>
I made no representation anywhere in that post what should be done as a result or options that are available to refine the situation.  I accurrately stated the goals of the guilds as they entered the ToVN rotation and agreed to the terms.  I offered no opinion or suggestion and somehow this was turned into &quot;Dr. Strangerogue: or How I Learned to Hate Smaller Guilds&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umalakarude.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MalakaRude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 9:43:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dhbergen/malaka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> i wasnt trying to say that you were a little guild hater gromm, that is ootampa's job <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I was just saying that maybe in the history it was done in one way, that doesnt mean that way has to be done for every other guilds.<br>
<br>
As you stated, in history it was pretty different situation. When SOT killed them, there wasnt any rotation made. When NB and tindi started to kill them, they already had the power to kill roy. They didnt chose to kill them before because they were on dragon faction (i guess).<br>
<br>
Now there are guilds that are on giant faction, that would be able to kill them in some undefined time. And i think they should be able to kill them if they wanted. <p><center><b><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=156296">Malaka's Profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugranitfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Granitfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 10:04:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=28>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> I never once stated that you hated little guilds.

<br>
Your next paragraph stated &quot;I guess the main issue is that none of the guilds who are in ToVN now&quot; so that brings us to the present.  <br>
<br>
What offended me was the part where you said &quot;They were a part of a far larger, and more important, goal that was clearing ToVN.&quot;  If I took that wrong then I am sorry and I apologize.  What it looks like you are stating is that the goal of clearing ToVN was much more important than shooting for just Eashen.  I was offended there because that would be YOUR goal, not mine or possibly any other, I personally would be overjoyed to kill Eashen.<br>
<br>
OK I was just informed that you can not move to the rest of NToV with out engaging Eashen and Ikatair.  So that is settled.  My question is this.  Guild A is in ToV and they are full force farming the west wing.  Eashen spawns and there is no other of the big named up.  I understand the whole FFA and rotation mobs.  The point I am making......is that Guild A isnt even allowed to TRY Eashen because of the RTA.  Now what if they can kill Eashen and Ikatair but not the others?  Why not let them?<br>
<br>
Besides everyone throwing up in my face that its part of the RTA the rules and its part of NToV rotation mobs.....can anyone please tell me why you can't start the NToV rotation at Aaryonyar?<br>
<br>
As I understand the RTA rotations were made to protect the little guilds and I am curious here.....all the other rotations are on a single entity correct?  But NToV is a group of mobs.  I don't understand why taking 2 mobs off the protected list would be that bad?<br>

<br>
ikitiar and eashan are not as hard as otehr mobs in tovn, but they do drop desired loot (at least 1 or 2 per).<br>
<br>
The whole point of rotations is you give, and you take:<br>
<br>
I give up 2 avatar of war kills, to ensure i will always get one (every 3rd spawn) if i want it.  I give up 2/3 of the xerkish spawns in sra, i give up 1/2 of the hp spawns, 1/2 of the blood spawns, 1/5th of the dozekar spawns, 1/x of etc etc etc...I trade smaller loot intake to my guild for order.  I sacrifice, but in exchange i know that if i want to, i can kill any mob in the game, regularly (depending on # of rotation member).  <br>
<br>
Most rotations are mob based, because they are clear cut cases of: kill this mob, loot it, grats... there are also instance of other situations. For instance:<br>
<br>
Plane of fear: it probably has 350 mobs in it. Do we put each mob on rotation?  HAH no!... we put the zone on rotation (and separately the god, because the zone pops every 12h, the god every 7d.  ToV is basically 3 zones, all connected.<br>
<br>
ToVwest (the 3 dragons), HoT, and ToVnorth.  It has been decided from the very first inception of rotation, that once you were admitted to the rotation, you had all 15 (ikky, eash, arry, felsh, dagarn, kriezen, mirelenna, koi, vyemm, zlex, cek, sev, nev, jor, vulak (until removed)) protected for 48hours.  Your 'passage' to this protection is by killing arrynar (because you basically can only kill 2/15 of tov until you kill him... after this, in all likelyhood you can steamroll the rest.  <br>
<br>
If people take it upon themselves to snipe the front 2, for loot or whatever reason, then they again are sitting on the fence:  if you can kill ikky/eash, in all likelyhood you can kill king t, statue, dain, zlandicar.  So, under this sccenario, you are using double standards with the rotation, that is: you enjoy the safety of having mobs protected for you, uncontested and then 'rebel' against the rotations when it doesnt suit your needs/wants.  <br>
<br>
If people begin to snipe ikky/each, then he will in effect go FFA, which will, in effect remove him from existence in the game (trust me).  So, this is where you 'give' - you exercise discipline, and avoid sniping ikky/eash (unless you have genuine intent to try arry, win or loose - if you are genuinely making an effort to enter the rotation, you are in the right here), and meet the prereqisites to enter the tovN rot, from there, you too will enjoy a GUARANTEED shot/kill/loot of ikky/eash/ and beyond every X weeks until this game goes out of business, or you move on.<br>
<br>

<br>
Yea I understand, if you snipe those 2 dragons the whole rathe with give you the fat one.  Yes I understand the concept of rotational mobs...as was stated before.  I also understand that FFA is bad, see mes be edjumicated =). <br>
<br>
Well I have a suggestion then since all FFA is bad.  I can handle killing Lodi but I am never guaranteed a shot at him, @#%$ I can never beat the wizards there,  so can you guarantee me a shot at him?  Since I have had the patience to make sure that I could do him?  No Lodi is a FFA mob...so is Vindi, since there are FFA mobs why can not 2 more be added to that list?  These 2 dragons are involved in NO quest and can easily be seperated from NToV.  <br>
<br>
<br>
All I asked about was 2 dragons being moved to the FFA list....and if that would be possible.   If not explain why, please don't be condensending and rude.   Ohh thats right I forgot that ALL mobs that drop decent loot are protected by the RTA.   Emil you talked about double standards and how I would only be killing this to suit my needs/wants.   Who has the double standards here?  EVERY mob isnt covered by the rotation it would be crazy if they were.  I agree there is a reason for rotational mobs, there is also a reason for FFA mobs.

On a lighter side I really don't see people or guilds going there with one of their purposes of making PP off the rot drops or selling tradable decent items, ie Lodi shields. <p><center><BR><font color= Blue><BR><i>Granitfist/Jeribu<i/><BR><i>GrandMaster/High Priest<i/><BR><i>Co-Leader of Circles End<i/><BR><i>The Rathe<BR><center><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370733">The Monk </> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370756">The Cleric<i/>

The reason why they are FCFS is that the guilds who were on rotation agreed to drop the rotation OR the guilds who were capable (having already done so) agreed to continue to leave those mobs on FCFS status.<br>
<br>
As the only guilds who currently are able to (and do) kill Ikatair/Eashen are on the ToVN rotation list and they have stated that they wish them to remain on the rotation, they should remain on the rotation.  At such a time as there are others who do kill these mobs, the issue is moot. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 9/16/02 7:00:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugranitfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Granitfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 10:59:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> Ok I made a mistake when I said FFA, I should have said FCFS.

they are simply 'too easy' to kill (ie: they dont require a guild effort). a side effect of this, is that it is virtually impossible to 'police' those who kill them at will. in addition, imagine the # of applications for rotation, hehe..<br>
<br>
I agree, mobs like gor should be on rot, if requested, but frankly i expect nothing from complications from it, as he is easily 1 grouped (by wiz/necros - who dont even need to be in a guild, thus there would be no tangible discipline/warnings to issue them)<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Basically it isnt the RTA who decides everything like that for the rathe but BoTS, Tindi and NB leadership? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The rules of rotations are decided by the guilds on the rotations.  If you want to know the rotation agreement on Arch Lich, talk to NB, Tindi, or BotS... not RTA.  If you want to know the rotation agreement on Trakanon, talk to NB, LoL, TL, VoF, CoN, ED, VoLS, FS, FK, EotF, LoM, and S4H.  For Zlandicar, talk to NB, LoL, VoF, FK, TL, HE, CB, LoM, CoN, and SoY.  For other mobs, look at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Rotations.asp">www.jakefitch.com/rta/Rotations.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> which is where I cut and pasted those lists from.  The RTA is a collection of committees I guess...  not a single committee.<br>
<br>
I can tell you a lot of the original agreements on mobs but I couldn't tell you the latest agreements on several (like Trakanon or Severilous or Zlandicar) because we aren't active participants of those rotations anymore.  They may have changed the rules since we were in those rotations. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 9/16/02 7:19:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugranitfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Granitfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 11:21:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=36>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> Nyca as all know CE is not even close to being able to try these mobs.  The reason I took my stance on this was because it was brought up and now seemed like the best time to address this.  In a month or 2 CE might be able to do these 2 mobs, other guilds are ready now.<br>
<br>
I took this stand because I truelly felt that it was unfair that the 3 votes that decide this all come from guilds who can steam roll NToV.  At 100 active people for each guild this amounts to not even a tenth of the Rathe.  Of course they are going to look out for their better interests, but what about the other 90 percent of the Rathe.  Those mobs are very hard for any guild other than the big 3, but to straight up say...no pissoff you can not even try or attempt them, you can not fight them, you can't even look at them or we will say that you are sniping them.  <br>
<br>
Most guilds won't even attempt them, some will but how can you seriously justify telling others that they cant even try???  Why play a game?  For the challenge or to get the best equipment possible regardless of the cost or to be with friends?  I play for the challenge of mobs and my friends, all I was asking is why can't they be moved to fcfs?  I was told my answer, the leaders of Tindi, BoTs and NB have decided that THEY, not the people of the rathe make that choice and THEY said no.

Is that greedy?  Sure, I'll admit it.  Everyone kills mobs out of greed, lets not lie to each other.  We want loot, mobs give it.<br>
<br>
We can already see what would happen by looking at the Status and AoW rotation.  AoW guilds often wait 24 hours for the Statue guild to get over to Kael and kill him.  Which is fine, AoW is one mob, 1-2 hour raid at most.  But NToV is a 10-12 hour raid, over 1 or 2 days.  And it takes a large amount of people.  So NToV guilds really dont want to wait 3 hours for United Necros (used for a generic guild name) kills 2 dragons.<br>
<br>
These 2 mobs need to be killed to get into NToV.  Yes, in theory one could get to Roy without them being dead, but one wrong step by ANYONE in the raid would mean a wipe out and coffin CR.<br>
<br>
FFA on the mobs might work.  And I would be willing to discuss that possibility when another guild has killed them.  But until then you dont really know what it takes to get in to them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As I understand the RTA rotations were made to protect the little guilds and I am curious here<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Incorrect.  Rotations were started so the &quot;big&quot; guilds could share mobs.  As other guilds kill we let them onto the rotation.  They are not here to protect smaller guilds, however it is a nice side benefit.<br>
<br>
Rotations and the RTA in general are compromises.  Sometimes the big guild give up something, some times the little guild give up something.  BotS agrees to only kill Trak once in 3 months, even though they can kill him with an exp group... Clan Bashemded agrees to leave not kill Ikky and Eashan. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uemilsinclair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 11:32:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> you are looking at it from your perspective:<br>

<br>
No one has ever said &quot;you can't try&quot;.  All that is said is that Iki and Eashan are part of the NToV Rotation.  All the guilds that have gotten onto that Rotation know that, and have accepted it.<br>
<br>
If, and when, guilds get to that point, kill Iki and Eashan and walk away without even taking a shot at Aary, well, I don't think that will ever happen.<br>
