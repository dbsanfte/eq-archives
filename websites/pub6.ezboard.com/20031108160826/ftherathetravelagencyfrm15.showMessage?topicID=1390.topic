<br>
I figure it this way, I would have made the upgrades to my computer anyway--maybe I have done a bit more than I would have, but I doubt it.  <br>
<br>
I've only been playing since the October after it came out, but for the last 2+ years, I've carried 2 accounts.  So put me down for ~$30 a month.<br>
<br>
Now with all the friends that I've made, and the fun that I've had, $30 is a small price to pay.  <br>
<br>
I save money this way though:  If I were not playing, I'd probably be purchasing the newest games--2 to 3 a month, and don't forget the game systems, upgrades, and other misc that goes with them.  Not to mention how much I'd be going out to the bars (probably keeping me out of trouble), and how many other things that are non productive that I'd be doing that costs more money in 1 night, than EQ does in 2 months.<br>
<br>
Overall, yes EQ cost money...but how many things that are fun don't(get your mind out of that gutter, and that can cost money too, IE KIDS).  <br>
<br>
Addiction?  Yes, you could probably put me in that category, but on the other hand, I have quit before because of it consuming too much of my time and it causing problems, and would gladly do it again if it came to causing problems.  Everything in moderation I guess is the saying. <br>
<br>
Well those are my thoughts, I'll be intersted in seeing others views. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zyrtryxconjureblade>Zyrtryx Conjureblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 2:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1390.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cost of EQ?</span><hr size=1> If I had known?<br>
<br>
HELL FUCKING NO!<br>
<br>
I'm pissed off as it is right now, because of all the time I spend in-game bored out of my skull!<br>
<br>
Let me explain:<br>
<br>
I am a lvl 43 Magician, who, by all rights, should be AT LEAST approaching lvl 60, if not already past it by now. But I can't solo due to bad lag spikes that hit at inopportune times. (Ever tried to whack an HG or run from a mob that will eat you alive and has a lag spike hit that lasts over a minute? `Nuff said) <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it seems most people don't want to group with a lvl 43 Magician, either because they don't give a crap about DSP, or aren't familiar with Magicians (or just plain don't like us). So when I'm logged on as this character, I spend about 80% of my time running from zone to zone LFG without success (the LFG tool is useless), 10% of the time actually grouping and hunting, and the other 10% of the time doing tradeskills and complaining. (Well, I actually spend 90% of the time complaining, but you get what I'm saying)<br>
<br>
I took over a month off from EQ out of disgust over not being able to find a group most of the time. Then I bought LDON (retail version) Friday. Didn't find a group Friday night, but I did find one on Saturday night, another on Sunday. Unfortunately, both adventures failed due to problems the group encountered. (I won't go into detail, but they were assassination missions, and each was in a different zone) Since then, I've been on every night either trying to find a group or start one on my own, and I've just ended up being bored, pissed off, and disgusted. I decided to take a break and not even log on tonight, because I'm at the point where I'd probably go postal if I couldn't find a group.<br>
<br>
And when I complain, I either get told to solo (even though I've already explained why I can't) or go run another character (my highest alts are lvl 15, because I don't run them much, and the only one I'd even consider using as my main eventually is lvl 11), which ticks me off even more.<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with the money, just the time I've wasted simply trying to be able to hunt!<br>

The cost of the game and various expansions was less than what i paid in books to read, heh a lot less :P, over the years that ive been playing,  and the subscription per month is much less than what basic entertainment would have been without eq.  Even if you are just looking at going out to eat at a cheaper restaurant (non fast food), tickets for 2 at a regular movie, softdrinks, snacks at said movie, just once a month, that one evening would cost you more than subscription for 2 accounts for the entire month.  I would say the time per cost per entertainment value and social value (for those of us too shy to speak up or talk to strangers) is very much in favor of EQ.   <br>
<br>
Theres a lot worse you can be doing in your spare time for entertainment than eq.  <br>

<br>
And it was a choice.<br>
<br>
About 4 years ago, we decided to buy a house, that meant budgeting.<br>
<br>
Entertainment was considered. Some of our hobbies were pretty expensive.<br>
<br>
Hubby and I each chose a hobby within our budget and one shared entertainment expense.<br>
<br>
I chose EQ. I haven't regreted one minute of it. It has been quite economical considering other issues. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pocketsfullofgold@therathetravelagency>Pockets FullOfGold</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 9:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1390.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Cost of EQ?</span><hr size=1> <br>
The Cost of EQ.  While over the years for me has been quite a pretty penny, not so much as most of you since I only have one account, I look at it more of an escape from the hassles of real life.  While this is Flame Central and there are a number of people who love to throw down on anyone and everyone who posts here in one form or another, I tend to come here and read things just to laugh.  This is a nice post so we can present good and bad sides of this situation.<br>
<br>
I look at EQ as an escape because I can vent some frustrations without doing it outside where I might hurt myself through drinking/driving or doing something stupid.<br>
<br>
I also look at it in a good way.  Can you say you have met so many people from so many different cultures or countries/states if you had not found/played EQ?  I have met online and in person people I would never have known had I not met them on EQ.<br>
<br>
Another thing, while it happens everywhere on the net and not just EQ, the screen allows us to be ourselves without having to worry about what we look like, how we sound, if we measure up to someone's expectations.  Can you say that if you walk into a dancehall or a bar looking to enjoy your night?<br>
<br>
I for one am willing to spend a bit of my funds to enjoy chatting, killing, tradeskilling for the few pennies per day it costs to play without having to worry whether or not someone likes what I look like.<br>

God no kidding. Nor Paludal, nor DSP, nor c3 on tap everywhere you go. I had the old world that hated me, Kunark where 1 city liked me, and a double race/class xp penalty. And the worst post-50 to 60 spellset of all classes.  And dial up internet.  Suck it up.<br>

<br>
Yes I pay for 2 accounts, and DSL service (which was a great idea since now he can surf while I play since he doesn't play EQ) and have all the expansions.  But I still have something to show for it...<br>
<br>
I can list off a number of people I met through the game and then gone on to meet in RL.  Some very close and dear friends.<br>
<br>
And a small fringe benefit...if you can make RL friends out of your EQ ones, I find them to be better than the friends you made from work, school, church or the bar.<br>
<br>
Like I tell my &quot;EQ friends&quot;--when in town, look me up, come and stay.  <br>
<br>
That, and hours online with people who make me laugh, or are at least interesting is worth the few dollars I spend a month on EQ. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khelendrose>Khelendrose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/30/03 5:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1390.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cost of EQ?</span><hr size=1> Wife and I have been playing since a week after Kunark was released. <br>
<br>
Over all, it has saved us alot of money in video rentals, new video games, movies, bars, board games, ect, etc. It is something we both enjoy doing, and it is cheap over all. <br>
<br>
Most of all, we have made a multitude of REAL friends due to this game, and that is purely priceless!<br>
<br>
Is it an addiction?<br>
<br>
It is a hobby to most. To those that have a weakness to addictions, yeah, it is addictive. But anyone with a strong sense for morals, or responsibility knows it as a hobby. <br>
<br>
Cant remember who's quote this was, but I had a teacher (waaay back) that used to use this all the time. <br>
<br>
&quot;Never give responsibility to the weak minded, they know not what to do with it.&quot;<br>
