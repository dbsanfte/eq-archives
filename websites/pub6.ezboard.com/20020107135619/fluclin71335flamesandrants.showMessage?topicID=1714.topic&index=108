Do you equate Backstabbing a fire beetle for 3 points of damage to backstabbing a friend ( even though in game ) and stealing an item worth thousands $$?  If so, thats some seriously perverse logic.  If you can't see a difference there...you justify lack of moral's very easily.<br>
<br>
Chakan, I consider myself Christian, but you can't go around judging people and telling them &quot;where there going to go,&quot; because you don't know.  You can't judge heart conditions.  You ever heard the phrase, &quot;Judge not, that you do not be judged on the same account that you are judging&quot; ?  Point is, you are imperfect as well, just like Bigox, me, or anyone else. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=34639>Damacis Bigadanu!</a>

To the others that talk about forgiveness, you have to acknowledge what you did was wrong and have to regret doing it before you can be forgiven.  Think of it like this.

<br>
As for Bigox, since he lacks any guilt associated with what he did in EQ, I bet this isn't an isolated incident for him.  It's probably his standard mode of operation.  I bet if some of the people he let use his account had of pulled a similar stunt, he wouldn't be making smug comments about pixels.  The simple truth is people put time and effort into these pixels and that's what he stole. <p><a target="new" href="http://veilofshadows.org/screen/zaboo.jpg">Zaboo Krusher</a><BR>

<br>
-I certainly think there are degrees of &quot;wrong&quot;.  Is every kid who ever stole bubble gum from somewhere and didn't apologize going to &quot;hell&quot;?  Don't you think that's a little extreme? Or is he going to be sitting right next to Charles Manson burning in the eternal fires, etc?  I don't know that I would want to take part in any religion that would equate the 2.<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I still don't believe that anyone is going to &quot;hell&quot; for anything they do in a video game.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  It's a GAME.  Yes I realize that people put in time and effort.  Of course.  But that doesn't make it less a game.  People aren't really getting killed daily, it's not real money, we don't run around killing stuff, we don't actually worship the gods we choose, etc.  I don't see how you think that your morality applies to one aspect (going to hell for stealing pixilated money) but not to another (NOT going to hell for killing or worshiping another god,etc.).  Which brings me to my next point: Is everyone who duels or plays on a PVP server going to hell?  They're killing a char that someone worked on. What's the difference? There are SO many points you could say are &quot;sins&quot; in game but it's a GAME. So, my point was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I think stealing IS wrong in any form.  I DON'T think you're going to hell for stealing in a game.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The fact that you'll choose to apply your standards to part of the game (stealing) and not others is what's actually interesting here... It seems that you're the one saying some things aren't &quot;wrong enough&quot;.<br>
-Don't misunderstand me.  I don't think you should steal from anyone (yes, I have high standards).  I just don't think you're going to hell for it.<br>
-I don't BELIEVE in hell so it's a moot point anyway.  I don't think you're going for anything.<br>

-You have to acknowledge what you did was wrong to whom?? I thought that was between the &quot;sinner&quot; and God according to most religions. How would you know if the person who stole (I don't even remember who we were talking about anymore) acknowledged to God that he was wrong?  If so, are the religious people who said he's going to hell needlessly bashing him?  Do they have the right to judge him at all? <br>
<br>
Anyway, I learned long ago not to argue religion with people so this will be my last post on this.  I didn't actually mean to get into a lengthy discussion about it, I just wanted to make the point that I'm not saying stealing is right.  You're never going to change my mind, I'm not going to change yours so let's just drop it.  Sorry for the length everybody. Back to the professional flaming and ranting regularly scheduled.<br>

Bigox has already admitted to stealing a Spectre of Destruction under the pretense he was &quot;borrowing&quot; it when in fact he EBayed it. For forgiveness, Bigox would have to come to terms with the person he got the SoD from. Notice, I'm not talking about Heaven, Hell, or religion here. I'm talking about common decency to your fellow man.  I don't see this as a religous argument as much as treating other people like you want to be treated yourself. <p><a target="new" href="http://veilofshadows.org/screen/zaboo.jpg">Zaboo Krusher</a><BR>

<br>
there's a huge difference between Religion and God..<br>
it's easy to believe in a God simply for &quot;reality's&quot; sake.. since we have no clue how we got here, etc. at this point in time, it's easy to say there's some un-seen power over-seeing things<br>
but that doesn't mean you need to believe in a religion to believe in a God. all religions (that i know of) have a bottom line of morals they are trying to enforce upon their followers. and they are all pretty similar. mostly revolving around the Golden rule. as long as you follow the Golden rule, you should be fine. and to think a god would only accept one &quot;religion&quot; for everyone on earth, even those that lived in secluded places and never even had a chance to hear of someone elses beliefs of heaven and hell and god, etc. that means they have no chance of going to heaven.<br>
and yes, i know some religions make exceptions for those people.. but why not just make exceptions for anyone you choose then? *shrug*<br>
<br>
<br>
oh, and to whoever started babbling about evidence of &quot;life&quot; what gives us morality?<br>
*i think*....<br>
basically the only thing that makes us special is that fact that we have an extensive memory.. once you can remember events you can analyze them and choose how you think based on your past experiences and knowledge.<br>
if you were to remove someone's memories completely, would you actually expect them to be moral?<br>
do you expect a little kid to be moral, before you teach them what morals are?<br>
morality isn't a learned behavior as much as it is a series of decisions we are uniquely able to make due to our memories full of what we have learned through out our life.<br>
