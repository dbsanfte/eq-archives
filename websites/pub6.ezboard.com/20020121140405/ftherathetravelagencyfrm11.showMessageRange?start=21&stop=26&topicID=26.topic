<br>
I'm amused that you resort to name calling.  It does go to prove my point about how childish your arguments are.  Time and time again your entire argument is &quot;I demand FFA noobie.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Well, I have news for you, I don't really care WHAT you think.  Your calling me a noobie is a complement considering the source.  If not being a noobie means being like you, I will wear the title noobie with PRIDE.  <br>
<br>
I do however wish that you would take the time and effort to read most of the posts.  The guilds which post on this calendar have done nothing but bend over backwards to make you happy.  The absolute greed and arrogance that you show towards others astounds me and makes me truly worry for your mental health.  <br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is this, as little as you like it, the Freaks Band alliance has an equal vote on this matter as CIW does.  EVERY guild counts equally Qwai, and you need to get that through your head.  No matter how much you might wish to force us to accept your ideas you MUST accept that you are only one of many.  <br>
<br>
You do not like people disagreeing with you, obviously.  But rather than propose ideas and work towards compromise you continually insist that your way or the highway.  Honestly Qwai, NO one believes you any more.  You cry wolf too many times.<br>
<br>
Our vote was compromise between your unreasonable demand for a 9 pm deadline and many others who want a midnight deadline.  As long as you continue to make personal attacks, all that happens is the thread gets put in the flames forum where any meaningful idea within it dies.  <br>
<br>
The 6 am is a deadline is the deadline to get a big brother guild OUT of the plane.  Can CIW clear fear after another guild has started in less than 7 hours?  If not then why are you a BB guild?<br>
<br>
You are a BB guid because we, the other members of this calendar DO believe that you have a better shot at your epic quests.  We have GIVEN you that ability because you have promised to HELP us if we need it.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that your stance is you believe that CIW should be called in every time a god is up as early as possible because you are better than us.  I have news for you, I don't look up to you and if it were not for the examples of irrational thought I would not look down upon you either.<br>
 <br>
My firm belief is that the BB idea should be done away with.  Let guilds PICK who they invite when they need help and if they do not kill the god with help remove them from the calendar.  Qwai would never go for that because during the time he has been insulting most of the people on this board another BB guild has been making &quot;friends&quot;.  Maybe they are being political for their own purposes, but to put it bluntly, they get more phat l33t.  Maybe you should think about that Qwai.<br>
<br>
The BB system is about mutual respect and teamwork to maximize epic items on The Rathe.  It is NOT because if we don't agree to it CIW will FFA.  Qwai cannot handle the responsibility of having to help others.  When he was asked to help a guild when there was nothing to gain, the first thing he does is come running to this board asking why did they bother him.  Qwai is all about greed and the funny thing is I bet he wonders why no one calls CIW asking for help.<br>

I do have one request if you cant post in an adult manner then post in the flame board. We made this forum so we didnt have to deal with that crap. You speak for you guild so start speaking maturely please or dont waste our time.<br>
<br>
the REASON most people are starting to balk at the 9 pm thing is its gone from the time to notify the bb IF you think you need help to some thinking that if you havent killed him yet you get to come in right then. No way. Its only if they will not be able to and its obvious. You still have to get their permission to come in.<br>
<br>
Being a BB guild is a privelidge not a right. And us NOOBS can handle the planes just fine without any help thank you very much. Most guilds wont need help. That raid date is theirs to do with, not yours. Im not going to see an entire raid have to work around a BB guild thats ridiculous. We set a reasonable call in time and 11 pst is fine after the arguments ive heard it makes more sense. That gives 3 hours. The bb guild can check in earlier as well and with the earlier post on where you should be at a certain time that sounds good. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umanaspineblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Manas Pineblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://psicopro.tripod.com/isw1h55.gif height = 13 width = 15 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 218<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/17/01 5:52:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://psicopro.tripod.com/manas.jpg height = 153 width = 123></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Trying again</span><hr size=1> Qwai with all due respect, what the hell is the matter with you?  <br>
<br>
First off, this isn't the thread to be arguing over what time bb guild should be called in.<br>
<br>
Second off, how the hell is anyone supposed to mediate this in a peaceful manner when you make a blatant attack on a person for no reason other than to piss that person off.<br>
<br>
Being vocal is good, being vocal and trying to cause a deadlock in this is NOT.  Please realize that no matter what, the majority of people will most likely never want FFA, and will support the evils that a calander system brings because it is the lesser of two evils.  Trying to start flames and prolonging this discussion isn't making life any fookin easier.  Your view has been heard, unless you have something constructive to add to the argument please take the advice of a grumpy old gnome and STFU.<br>
<br>
Arguing isn't going to solve shit, neither is name calling.  If your serious about trying to make a situation that most of the guilds can live with then by all means share your ideas, be them long or short.  But if you wanna call people names take that baby bullshit over to flames, it isn't helping resolve anything here.<br>
<br>
Breaking my own rule however, im thinking a 9pm pmt warning to gear up for a 10pm pst entry into fear is not unresonable, and the out time to gtfo of fear could be extended to 3 am pmt without too much disruption to the next days raid i think.  But don't comment on that here, save it for the post its supposed to be in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

You know what?<br>
<br>
Easy answer time.<br>
<br>
Set a deadline (say, end of the month.  Feb. 28th) and if the Epic Guilds can't present a set of rules that they all agree to at that time, the epic rotation is just discarded.<br>
<br>
I'm sick and goddamn well tired of seeing every non-epic guild go wild trying to find rules that will massage the egos and satisfy the bizarre paranoias of various epic guilds who are more bent on being jackasses in the flames folder than working to come up with a solution.<br>
<br>
So that's my suggestion:<br>
<br>
Kill all discussion of what the epic rules are outside the 1 issue of 'what time do you call in the epic by'.  The rest of it is freaking irrelevant to everyone but the epic guilds.<br>
<br>
let THEM figure it out, and if they can't figure it out by the end of the month, we go with the simplest calendar system available, with minimal loopholes:<br>
<br>
1 reservation on a plane at a time<br>
40 minimum planesable accounts<br>
6 max guest invites from any 1 guild or posting alliance<br>
Sky reservable fri/sat and sat/sun or whatever.<br>
If a god is up, you MUST take it down, or you lose 1/2/3 months posting rights (increasing penalties)<br>
<br>
There.  it's simple, there's very little wiggle room, and the admins have a clear and simple method for punishing people who leave gods up past their spawn time.<br>
<br>
Think you can't take the god down?  Gee, better trade dates with another guild asap.  better call in additional help.  Otherwise, expect to not go to the planes any time soon.<br>
<br>
All this endless bickering over rules language and byzantine epic guild rules is just stupid as hell.<br>
<br>
Make it simple and straightforward, and if the guilds like BotS are worried because they aren't going to get enough god loot without an epic rotation, GET BUSY AND FIX IT.<br>
<br>
It's not my problem.  I'll get the same amount of god loot either way : none.<br>
<br>
You want it, You fix it.<br>

<br>
                            We have about hammered out some new guildlines to address the concerns of the call in time. It's being<br>
                            drafted right now and should be up in the next couple days. That is what was asked of us and that is what<br>
                            we have done. <br>
<br>
                            In the meantime the epic guilds need to get some kind of &lt;insert word&gt; in place, coucil, admin, king, godess,<br>
                            call it whatever. In the future the promise of this calendar system is to make sure the god dies. If a<br>
                            guild/alliance/posting entity doesn't conform to the guidelines that have been agreed on there will be<br>
                            consequences<br>
<br>
                            The 40 rule, <br>
                            the 2am rule<br>
                            6 invites<br>
                            one plane per day<br>
                            etc<br>
                            etc<br>
                            etc<br>
                            now the time to call bb in. The epics wanted, we agreed to it, here it is.<br>
<br>
                            Now if an epic guild breaks one of the upper rules, the 40 (laf) the 2am, one plane a day etc etc, there will be<br>
                            the same consequenses for them. <br>
<br>
                            However if the epics feel one has violated *THEIR* arrangement, not taking turns, or not being able to clear<br>
                            the plane as promised, etc it's *THEIR* problem.<br>
<br>
                            So Stygar take your complaints to the other epic guilds. We will make sure the BB are called in a reasonable<br>
                            time and if not there are consequences. If you feel there is aproblem with another epic don't come here and<br>
                            shout FFA. You need to find another solution. Our half of the calendar (so to speak) works.<br>
<br>
                            If there are problems on your end... they are yours. As Bias said if you guys want justice, ie epic guilds can<br>
                            not be guests on raids when the god is up, etc etc etc, then you guys go hammer it out and give us the<br>
                            results. We'll post them, make sure the guild of the day follows them... whatever we can do to aid you. You<br>
                            get to enforce them.<br>
<br>
                            Just don't alter any of the work we have done here. Your system needs to fit into this one, not override it.<br>
                            And in the end if you have problems with *YOUR* system then it's up to *YOU* fix it, don't come here<br>
                            screaming FFA.
