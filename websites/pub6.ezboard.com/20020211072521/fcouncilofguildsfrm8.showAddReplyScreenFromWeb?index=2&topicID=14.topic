<br>
Regarding the time (6 hours including the initial meet up time), this was actually an average time for dragon hunting - and considering the fact this entire team was composed of AC and many many people that have never met or hunted with each other before, I'd say this was more than just a successful event!  It was an efficient event, too (whatever that means *grin).<br>
<br>
Not sure why, but yesterday we had a great constellation of people with the right mix of patience, courtesy, listening skills and willingness to ask questions.  And every single one with an eagerness to trust strangers - good to see that Karana has such inhabitants still.<br>
<br>
In my sleep deprived state yesterday I only thanked my co-healer in my second group - stupidly forgetting to thank every other contributor in my groups (Danedar, Geaux, Lyme, Obno, Saliela (sp?), Simarill, Steelheart, Turtil and ack, I am forgetting someone here) as well as outside my groups - you've all done at least if not more than I was doing, so thank you!<br>
<br>
As for the Prayers of Life that I allegedly won yesterday:  I had a choice between sitting around waiting for the items to be distributed or going to bed, and I don't regret getting those extra minutes of sleep!!  But I made a choice, and by doing so, I opted out of the lottoes, and it's only fair that what I won goes to the 2nd highest roll - Brennen, I believe.  Jzonn, can you please give it to him?  But it was funny and really the highlight of the event for me to see how people were so considerate about others to the extent that they rolled for them in their absence (even without their knowledge of it - thanks, Tigerlight! *chuckle) and how everyone rallied to selflessly congratulate me while I was trying to camp out in NK, completely clueless.  Thanks, those kind gestures really made my day, and it should get me through work today after 2.5 hours of sleep  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

This had to do with the people present and their willingness to let the process go about as it should.  Were there things we did wrong?  Of course, but it didn't cripple the effort.<br>
<br>
For example, we didn't have a Shaman on the raid.  No Shaman slows, Talisman, or stat buffs.  I can tell you I was juggling the buffing order and applications as best I could.  Yes, it takes far longer than I would like, but you can't establish that order or even what will get buffed until you are just about to do it.  I had my list and it changed on the spot a couple times.  In many respects, this was like a pre-Kunark dragon run (with the buffs used).<br>
<br>
I would like to thank my guildmates and everyone else who came to support this effort.  Regretfully, I had to turn some people away.  I was receiving tells from people all the way up to the final buffing asking if soandso could join.  One of those tough choices being the raid leader is having to tell people no.  It's almost as tough as getting everyone to listen.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So now we know the CoG can take down a dragon.  It's a great experience and I recommend everyone (of the appropriate level) do his or her best to get involved in one.  It can only get better from here.<br>
<br>
Congrats to those who won the lottos.  Pippi did win the Prayers of Life, in absentia.  Keldon won the Treasure Hunter's Satchel.  Simarill won the Gold Plated Koshisomethingorother.  And Lima won the Red Dragon Scale.  Masamune received a Nilitim's Pg 401.  Parm won a Polished Mithril Mask from the FGs.<br>
<br>
I'm a bit tired at the moment, but I did want to post my thoughts this morning.  I may follow up on this as I think of more, but for now, I'm going back to sleep at my desk.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I have the next couple days off from EQ, so I hope to come back refreshed and ready to face new challenges. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utigerlight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tigerlight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/5/00 12:24:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.haleohana.com/members/images/tigerlight.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: congrats</span><hr size=1> Aye I must agree, it was a well run event. A shaman may have made it alot easier. Did anyone else notice something funny?<br>
<br>
Nag didn't heal himself. So unless I am mistaken he usually does so do not underestimate him next time, a Shaman would be an indubious addition to the hunt also.<br>
<br>
Pip you won the prayer loot by one point too! =) hehehe But I can think that we can safely say the loot is yours fair and if you would like to give it to anyone that is entirely up to your generosity..<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, who is this Mr Smartypants that you referred to on eqvault mm? =)<br>
<br>
Oh btw everyone Allie and Parentis came to watch they said we played very very dangerous game hehehe oh and to quote &quot;Congratulations. Next time be a little bit more careful and watch out for those Fire Giants&quot; =) <br>
<br>
Cheers Everyone for a good effort! <br>

Yes, a Shaman or two would have been great for the raid.  There were a couple Shaman buffs I would have liked to have had on each raid member.  If I had my preference, I would have 3 Bards, 2 Shamans, 2-3 Enchanters, 4 Clerics (49 or higher) on the raid.  As such, I did the best I could with those who participated.  As for the trash buffs, I don't think it really matters who casts them since they will be dispelled so quickly (which is why I had three Rangers cast them).<br>
<br>
I didn't think Naggy healed himself, but Tlat told me the next day he was casting Mana Sieve like a madman on Naggy.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If we do Vox again, I have a plan for her as well.  &lt;Insert maniacal laugh here&gt;.<br>
<br>
For the next raid, I think Blackburrow might be a good choice.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Of course, those loathesome individuals in Qeynos Hills need to get a lesson in humility.  The brownie scouts in Lesser Faydark could also use a good beatdown. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8>CoG Dragon Raids</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
