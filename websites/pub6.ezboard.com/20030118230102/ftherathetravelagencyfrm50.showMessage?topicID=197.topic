Plus I am not flaming anything..<br>
<br>
I want to ask a question, but before I do that I want everyone who wants to respond to this to pause for a second and realize what section you are in and to also think on your response. Try to be mature and DISCUSS something for once.<br>
<br>
Well anyways, ever since I started posting on the RTA no matter what I said I have just been flamed and shit on. I'm not saying all of my posts have been of the nature where flaming them is considered a pointless thing to do, but not just with mine, with ALOT of them there are people out there, that do nothing but dissect every last word typed by someone and attempt to find something wrong with it so that they may &quot;flame&quot; them.<br>
<br>
I'm really not sure of how everyone else feels about this, and this is my question. I get no sense of community from the Rathe. Maybe it is just me, but I don't consider having a small group of people who troll a certain messageboard doing next to nothing but putting someone else down, or lynching someone else after hearing ONE person's side of a confrontation or conflict in the game, a community.<br>
<br>
I really do not find much else about the RTA other than a cess pool of bigotry, lies, racism in some aspects, and online mob lynchings. I feel that this in no way shape or form helps the community, or lack thereof, one bit. <br>
<br>
A game that relies heavily on relations and interaction with other players, yet is populated by people of the nature that would rather just call someone &quot;e-bayed&quot; or a n00b is not something that holds interest for me as far as playing it goes.<br>
<br>
I feel that respect for your fellow player is at an all time low, and that the goal of a &quot;community&quot; board shouldn't be that as a medium for the players to duke out their battles publicly, trying to gain support over the opposition. But as a place where people should be able to come together, and post for help, or advice on something about the game. <br>
<br>
Yes, the flame board might help to give other players a heads up about the actions of a particular moron, but in general more harm is done than good.<br>
<br>
Nobody ever comes together for the greater good of the server as a whole. Yes, the Rathe has a rotation board, something many and unless I'm mistaken NO other servers implement being based off of the guilds coming together and deciding on it, and I think that is great. More things like that need to be done.<br>
<br>
The joke of EQ is beginning to become more apparant to me as I play more and more. I log on and duo with my shaman for essentially no reason other than to further myself in a game with no end and no community. <br>
<br>
Congratulations, you have publicly flamed someone for something you and him/her could have most likely resolved through a little bit of communication in-game and maturity. Now everyone here thinks lowly of that person.<br>
<br>
The reason I started playing EQ was because I liked the idea of developing a character and being that character in game. It made me happy and kept me busy. But when a game starts to only add to your everyday frustration, no longer bringing you enjoyment.. it's time to quit.<br>
<br>
Maybe I am not seeing some of the things that get done or accomplished through this board, but lately when I log in I have no desire or WANT to play, I just do it because I lack anything else to do. And I am trying to decide what I should do.<br>
<br>
I made a few generalizations and stereotypes in my post but I only did that to get my point across. Anybody else have feelings on our community? And if I you feel I am completely wrong, let me know why.<br>
<br>
But once again please do so refraining from the flame-type response and let's have an informative thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udovelyngoldenheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dovelyn Goldenheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 496<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/5/02 6:16:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=197.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A game that relies heavily on relations and interaction with other players, yet is populated by people of the nature that would rather just call someone &quot;e-bayed&quot; or a n00b is not something that holds interest for me as far as playing it goes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->If you're at all referring to me calling Yoott a n00b, it is a joke between friends.

What I can not understand is how these boards affect you in game. Perhaps you are just bored with the game and need a break. If the boards do bother you a ton, ignore them. I think it is a sickness though and we feel the need to come here no matter what...P <br>

This is a flame, this is some poor guy who everything in life is negative. If you go to this board and just read the Flames , yea everything you describe is true.<br>
<br>
The Flame board is for &quot;fun&quot; or for a &quot;release&quot;. the Rest of the board is plenty free of bombastic ignorant retoric.<br>
<br>
Personaly I take this whole post as a flame, and a knock on our community, You may not feel it but I sure do.<br>
<br>
If another admin agrees with me that this is a flame feel free to move it over to flames , I wont do it because its boarderline.<br>
<br>
One thing I do notice is your entire post is filled with negative commentary of the Rathe yet you claim its not a flame. I see no productive suggestions. Just plain this sucks this sucks , you suck , my mom sucks , everything sucks.<br>

As far as the flames go..dont read if they bug you.  Often times people just are venting..sometimes tho things actually get accomplished there.<br>
After playing a bit on a few other servers , i can tell you there is more of a sense of community here than on them.<br>

You get out of EQ the attitude you put into it. If you are semi burnt out you will think the sky is falling . EQ has a magical way of making things seem worse than they are. Cept the cyber , that seems to be better /shiver /moan /bite /lick <br>

<br>
If you don't like flames, dont read the flame forum, it's that simple. That forum in no way reflects the community of the Rathe, and in fact I agree with Vince in that it seems by your post that you are trashing the community by posting this in the calm and rational general discussion.<br>
<br>
 You should be directing this to those of us who troll the flame forum IN that forum where we would respond appropriately.<br>
<br>
Of course i already gave you an opening to start some 'rational' discussion there, and instead you passed it up and elected to post this diatribe here a few days later. /shrug.<br>
<br>
I am not sure exactly what you want from this, but the Rathe is perhaps the most civil community forum. Perhaps I should direct you to a few for comparison? I don't even mean the Zek forums, go take a look at the Brell rants page for example. Or Zeb.  Nearly any server, blue or red, is a LOT less nice then us.<br>
<br>
If you don't have a sense of community on the Rathe, well, I can only say that the problem is with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> YOU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> not the community. Go spend a week discovering the politics in game and on forums of a FFA server, you should find your perceptions altered in a hurry.<br>

What point?  That eq bores you now?  That's the only real point you made.  <br>
<br>
Generalizations and stereotypes never help to make a point, they only help to blur it.<br>
<br>
I get tired of people who always feel the need to blame others for everything.  If you are fed up with EQ then quit.  If you don't like reading the flames then don't read them.  Don't blame a message board for ruining the fun of a game.<br>
<br>
The community is in the game, not on this message board.  The message board is just a tool.  Also, in a community you have all sorts.  Every community doesn't sit around holding hands and singing &quot;kumbayah.&quot;  In a community people have disagreements, yell at each other, call each other names and do stupid things.  If you don't want to see these things then feel free to close your eyes to it, ignore it, but know that it will never go away. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uliviusmaximus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LiviusMaximus</A> at: 10/5/02 4:07:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukluztzul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KluzTZul</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows</span><br>  Posts: 275<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/5/02 3:31:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=197.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/phpBB2/images/avatars/3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> You mean as opposed to coming to a guilds own forums, and flaming everyone there, Zaketh? <p><a href=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Database/scripts/character-page.php?charid=5>Kluz</a><br><embed src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Flash/kluzsig.swf" quality=high pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="200" height="150"></embed><br><a href=http://www.fallenshadows.cjb.net>Fallen Shadows</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umavier.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mavier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/5/02 5:13:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=197.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> Its rhetoric nor retoric Vince you ebayed noob. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=263206">Balme</a><BR>

All arguments, unless it is purely &quot;UR MOM SUXXORS&quot; Vs. &quot;NO UR MOM SUXXORS&quot; are discussions.

Well anyways, ever since I started posting on the RTA no matter what I said I have just been flamed and shit on. I'm not saying all of my posts have been of the nature where flaming them is considered a pointless thing to do, but not just with mine, with ALOT of them there are people out there, that do nothing but dissect every last word typed by someone and attempt to find something wrong with it so that they may &quot;flame&quot; them.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
As someone who enjoys the dissection (though I prefer the vivisection) of a post, I'm going to reply at length here. <br>
<br>
I would first ask &quot;What is it that you have posted that has been shit on?&quot; and if you would engage in some honest discussion, answer this: Did you deserve it? Even posts that go to the flame board, unless they have a component that deserves to be flamed, they're generally left alone. Go post &quot;I like cats&quot; and you will get a couple of half assed replies and then it will die. We respond with the level of anger and rhetoric that a post deserves, and I'd offer that we do it, regardless of the poster. <br>
<br>
Now then, examining most closely the idea of dissecting a post and then hammering at the bad points:<br>
<br>
If someone presents a faulty argument- Bad, logically unsound, flawed, or just something so absolutely stupid- damn right I'm going to take it apart. <br>
<br>
If you have the ability to form ideas and thoughts, you should have the ability to defend those ideas, and the ability to present those ideas in a clear way. You'll notice, I never flame those who have a less-than-perfect command of english: Grammer nazi, I ain't. From this, I will always, in a conversation that I am interested in, defend or attack the side with which I agree, and vigorously. <br>
<br>
If the oppositions argument is stronger than mine, I don't belabour a point on which I am mistaken. They win; or we draw; or I win. But if you post a thought, and it's wrong for this server, wrong for how I look at the world, wrong for the way things need to go in order to maintain a reasonably civil server, then you're goddamn right I'm going to lower both barrels at it. And Reload. <br>
<br>
Mind you, KTHXPLZDRVTHRU is the language of the ignorant, and does not fall into the &quot;less than perfect command of english category&quot;. Unless it's being used as satire, these people are teh sux. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I'm really not sure of how everyone else feels about this, and this is my question. I get no sense of community from the Rathe. Maybe it is just me, but I don't consider having a small group of people who troll a certain messageboard doing next to nothing but putting someone else down, or lynching someone else after hearing ONE person's side of a confrontation or conflict in the game, a community.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Please note: the only recent lynching has been of Fablaar, and he deserves it. All other currently active flames are kinda weak. <br>
<br>
And by the way, these people that have 'trolled' the message boards, as you put it, are, by and large, representing those people who forged out the rotation systems, who fought and defended the reservations system, who basically have created the athmosphere on the server that the big 1, 2, 3 guilds don't own everything, with table scraps for guilds 4+. <br>
<br>
If you don't find the community, I'd suggest that you've done nothing but read the boards. Go play on the server, and as long as you are not a giant asshole, you'll probably have a good time :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I really do not find much else about the RTA other than a cess pool of bigotry, lies, racism in some aspects, and online mob lynchings. I feel that this in no way shape or form helps the community, or lack thereof, one bit. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hmmm. Well, speaking as a member of the cess pool... fuck you. I mean that in the nicest possible way, and use it to indicate that I am very opposed to your statement, don't take it as a personal attack :P Oh, in case you missed it, I'm using the &quot;I'm not flaming, but here's a flame&quot; approach. I'll return to my non-satirical examination now. <br>
<br>
The only 'bigotry' that is available in an anonomous online community, is the natural bias against people who are rude, ignorant of community standards, or more or less, just not &quot;good&quot; people. You can't tell if anyone is brown, black, orange, white, pink or green on the boards. <br>
<br>
Racism? I'll give you the benefit of the doubt again: I will assume you are indicating a systemic subjugation of a group of people, which allow priviledge and status to another group, to the detriment of equality, instead of just dropping a buzzword to make people feel bad. <br>
<br>
You're right. The Rathe, like other servers, has a minority of the population doing the highest end mobs, and raids. However, to *protect* the majority, who could be run over by the minority if they chose, this server has a system of reservations and rules that have been developed by conventions for years. This server is systemically stacked against guilds who *could* be doing more than they are, if they didn't want to abide by the semi-peaceful arrangements currently in place. <br>
<br>
However, in the sense you are using it, I'd hesitate to use Racism. Class-ism would be much better: if you belong to a certain &quot;class&quot; of guild, then you have certain obligations which may or may not be bad.  (Class to indicate category, not social status as a good/bad dichot...nevermind, you know what I mean) <br>
