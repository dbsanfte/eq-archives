I am suffering from rare and deadly diseases, poor scores on final exams, extreme virginity, fear of being kidnapped and executed by anal electrocution, and guilt for not out 50 billion fucking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on, then that poor fucking 6 year old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her off to the traveling freak show. <br>
<br>
Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you and everyone you send &quot;his&quot; email to $1000? How <br>
stupid are you? Ooooh, looky here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get laid by every Playboy Bunny in the magazine! What a bunch of fucking bullshit. <br>
<br>
So basically, this message is a big FUCK YOU to all the people out there who have nothing better to do than to send me stupid chain mail forwards. <br>
<br>
Maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my apartment and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing the chain which was started by Jesus in 5 A.D. and was brought to this country by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower and if it makes it to the year 2002, it'll be in the Guinness Book of World Records for longest continuous streak of blatant stupidity. Fuck them. If you're going to forward something, at least send me something mildly fucking amusing. <br>
<br>
I've <br>
seen all the &quot;send this to 50 of your closest friends, and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a Nickel from some omniscient being&quot; forwards about 90 times. I don't fucking care. Show a little intelligence and think about what you're actually contributing to by sending out forwards. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Chances are it's your own unpopularity. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

First of all, if you don't send this to 5096 people in the next 5 seconds, you will be raped by a mad goat and thrown off a high building into a pile of manure. It's true!

<br>
Send this to 10-20 people: 10-20 people will be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid chain letter and will napalm your house. Thanks!!!! Good Luck!!! <br>
<br>
<br>
Chain Letter Type 2 <br>
<br>
Hello, and thank you for reading this letter. You see, there is a starving little boy in Baklaliviatatlaglooshen who has no arms, no legs, no parents, and no goats. This little boy's life could be saved, because for every time you pass this on, a dollar will be donated to the Little Starving Legless Armless Goatless Boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen Fund.  Oh, and remember, we have absolutely no way of counting the emails sent and this is all a complete load of bullshit. So go on, reach out. Send this to 5 people in the next 47 seconds. Oh, and a reminder - if you accidentally send this to 4 or 6 people, <br>
you will die instantly. Thanks again!! <br>
<br>
Chain Letter Type 3 <br>
Hi there!! This chain letter has been in existence since 1897. This is absolutely incredible because there was no email then and probably not as many sad pricks with nothing better to do. So this is how it works... <br>
                 <br>
Pass this on to 15,067 people in the next 7 minutes or something horrible will happen to you like: <br>
<br>
Bizarre Horror Story #1 <br>
Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on Saturday. She had recently received this letter and ignored it. She then tripped in a crack in the sidewalk, fell into the sewer, was gushed down a drainpipe in a flood of poopie, and went flying out over a waterfall. Not only did she smell nasty, she died. This Could Happen To You!!! <br>
<br>
Bizarre Horror Story #2 <br>
Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter in his mail and ignored it.  Later that day, he was hit by a car and so was his boyfriend.  They both died and went to hell and were cursed to eat adorable kittens every day for eternity. This Could Happen To You Too!!! Remember, you could end up just like Pinsley and Bip. Just send this letter to all of your loser friends, and everything will be okay. <br>
<br>
Chain Letter Type 4 <br>
As if you care, here is a poem that I wrote. Send it to all your friends. <br>
<br>
FRIENDS: <br>
A friend is someone who is always at your side. <br>
A friend is someone who likes you even though you stink of shit, and your breath smells like you've been eating cat food. <br>
A friend is someone who likes you even though you're as ugly as a hat full of assholes. <br>
A friend is someone who cleans up for you after you've soiled yourself. <br>
A friend is someone who stays with you all night while you cry about your sad, sad life. <br>
A friend is someone who pretends they like you when they really think you should be raped by mad goats, then thrown to vicious dogs. <br>
A friend is someone who scrubs your toilet, vacuums and then gets the check and leaves and doesn't speak much English...no, sorry that's the cleaning lady. <br>
A friend is not someone who sends you chain letters because he wants his wish of being rich to come true. <br>
Now pass this on! If you don't, you'll never have sex ever again! <br>
<br>
The point being? <br>
If you get some chain letter that's threatening to leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it. If it's funny, send it on. <br>
<br>
Don't piss people off by making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth, who's been tied to a dead elephant for 27 years, whose only savior is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this mail, otherwise you'll end up like Miranda. Right? </font><P><a href="http://fullspeed.to/purgatory">

Peace out -Justin-<br>
<br>
I know you all are very caring people:<br>
<br>
I am a very sick boy little boy. My mother is typing this for me, because<br>
I can't. She is crying. Don't cry, Mommy! Mommy is always sad, but she says<br>
it's not my fault. I asked her if it was God's fault, but she didn't<br>
answer, and only started crying harder, so I don't ask her that anymore.<br>
<br>
The reason she is so sad is that I'm so sick. I was born without a body.<br>
It doesn't hurt, except when I go to sleep. The doctors gave me an artificial<br>
body. My body is a burlap bag filled with leaves. The doctors said that<br>
was the best they could do on account of us havin' no money or insurance. I<br>
would like to have a body transplant, but we need more money.<br>
<br>
Mommy doesn't work because she said employers don't hire crying people. I<br>
said, &quot;Don't cry, Mommy,&quot; and she hugged my burlap body. Mommy always<br>
gives me hugs, even though she's allergic to burlap, and it chafes her real<br>
bad.<br>
I hope you will help me. You can help me if you forward this e-mail.<br>
<br>
Dr. Van Nostrem from the clinic said if you foward this e-mail then Bill<br>
Gates will team up with AOL and do a survey with NASA. Then the astronauts<br>
will collect prayers from school children all over America and take them<br>
up to space so that theangels can hear them better. Then they will go to the<br>
Pope, and he will take up a collection in church and send the money to the<br>
doctors. The doctors could help me better then. Maybe one day I will be<br>
able to play baseball. Or maybe just use my lungs and heart, when the<br>
doctors make them. The doctors said that every time you forward this<br>
letter, the astronauts can take another prayer to the angels.<br>
<br>
Please help me. Mommy is so sad, and I want a body. I don't want my leaves<br>
to rot before I turn 10. If you don't forward this e-mail, that's OK.<br>
Mommy says you're a mean heartless shithead who doesn't care about a poor<br>
little<br>
boy with only a head. She says that if you don't stew in the raw pit of<br>
your own guilt-ridden stomach, she hopes you die a long slow horrible<br>
death so you can burn forever in hell. What kind of goddamned person are you<br>
that you can't take five fucking minutes to forward this to all your<br>
friends so<br>
that they can feel guilt and shame for the rest of their day, and then<br>
maybe help a poor, bodiless nine-year-old boy?<br>
<br>
Please help me. This really sucks. I try to be happy but it's hard.<br>
<br>
I wish I had a puppy. I wish I could hold a puppy.<br>
<br>
Thank You.<br>
Billy 'Smiles' Evans,<br>
the boy with just a head.<br>
And a burlap sack for a body.<br>

&gt;This chain letter was started in hopes of bringing relief to other tired and discouraged men. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;Unlike most chain letters, this one does not cost anything. Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are equally tired and<br>
discontented. Then bundle up your wife or girlfriend and send her to the man whose name appears at the top of the following list, and add your name<br>
to the bottom of the list. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;When your turn comes, you will receive 15,625 women. One of them is bound to be better than the one you already have. At the writing of this letter,<br>
a friend of mine had already received 184 women, of whom 4 were worth keeping. REMEMBER this chain brings luck. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;One man's pit bull died, and the next day he received a Playboy swimsuit model. An unmarried man living with his widowed mother was able to<br>
choose between a Hooters waitress and a Hollywood super model. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;You can be lucky too, but DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN! One man broke the chain, and got his own wife back again!! <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;Let's keep it going, men! Just add your name to the list below! <br>

One of my users forwarded it to me and asked how she could get in touch with her congressman.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I guess the warnings were true.  Federal Bill<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 602P 5-cents per E-mail Sent.  It figures!  No<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; more free E-mail! We knew this was coming!  Bill<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 602P will permit the Federal Government to charge<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 5-cent charge on every delivered E-mail.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Please read the following carefully if you intend<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to stay online, and continue using E-mail.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; The last few months have revealed an alarming<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; trend in the Government of the United States<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; attempting to quietly push through legislation<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that will affect our use of the Internet.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Under proposed legislation, the US Postal Service<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; will be attempting to bill E-mail users out of<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;alternative postage fees.&quot;  Bill 602P will<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; surcharge on every E-mail delivered, by billing<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Internet Service Providers at source.  The<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Washington, DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; without pay to prevent this legislation from<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; becoming law.  The US Postal Service is claiming<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; lost revenue, due to the proliferation of E-mail,<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; is costing nearly $230,000,000 in revenue per<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; year.  You may have noticed their recent ad campaign:<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;There is nothing like a letter.&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Since the average person received about 10 pieces<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of E-mail per day in 1998, the cost of the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; typical individual would be an additional 50<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; cents a day-or over $180 per year-above and<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; beyond their regular Internet costs.  Note that<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; this would be money paid directly to the US<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Postal Service for a service they do not even<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; provide. The whole point of the Internet is<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; democracy and noninterference.  You are already<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; paying an exorbitant price for snail mail because<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of bureaucratic efficiency.  It currently takes<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; up to 6 days for a letter to be delivered from<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; coast to coast.  If the US Postal Service is<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; allowed to tinker with E-mail, it will mark the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; end of the &quot;free&quot; Internet in the United States.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Congressional representative, Tony Schnell<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; has even suggested a &quot;$20-$40 per month surcharge<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; on all Internet service&quot; above and beyond the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; governments proposed E-mail charges Note that<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; most of the major newspapers have ignored the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; story-the only exception being the Washingtonian<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; which called the idea of E-mail surcharge &quot;a<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; useful concept who's time has come&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (March 6th, 1999 Editorial).<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Do not sit by and watch your freedom erode away!<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Send this E-mail to EVERYONE on your list, and<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tell all your friends and relatives write their<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; congressional representative and say &quot;NO&quot; to Bill<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 602P.  It will only take a few moments of your<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; time and could very well be instrumental in<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; killing a bill we do not want.<br>
