<br>
You have referred to my post in the &quot;Here Goes&quot; thread as &quot;sugarcoating&quot;, and specifically quoted a line in which I mentioned the fact that SoT has some fine players. How is that sugarcoating? I say what I mean...SoT has some fine players. Are you unable to accept that as an honest statement because it was posted on the Flame Central board? Or is your daily gaming environment so full of dishonest people that you can't believe I would actually just say what I meant?<br>
<br>
You've also referred to it as &quot;inflammatory&quot;. A matter of opinion, certainly...you may find it inflammatory in that I was calling attention to the then still absent apology from Shei. I don't see the truth as &quot;inflammatory&quot;, at least not in any pejorative sense.<br>
<br>
Be that as it may, I don't think anyone is that interested in diverting the topic of these discussions. A lot of your guildmates seem to be trying very hard to make amends and repair the damage done, even if they themselves did not take part in the theft of the Ragefire spawn. Shei has posted an apology, along with others of your leadership. Do you really think the few little posts I've made are so awful they merit so much attention, or did I just push one of your buttons?<br>
<br>
Tell you what, here's a deal. If you're really interested in discussing the matter with me, you can email me at chess@bearjangles.cncdsl.com. If, on the other hand, you're just trying to get the RTA readership's attention on anything BUT the topic at hand, you keep right on throwing out my name in any passing thread. <p>Chesse Shardic<BR>

You didnt like my intercepted letter...did you read it?  It doesnt sound like it.  I openly attacked the SILENCE of your leadership, not its members.  I said what your leaders where saying by not saying a word.  <br>
<br>
I dont believe SoT is the evil empire or doom and destruction.  I would encourage you to find one time before this I even came close to flaming SoT.  It hasnt happened.  I didnt jump in the fray because I like confrontation, I jumped in, because I dont want things like this happening to my guild.<br>
<br>
The logs clearly show that the Ragefire camp was intentionally taken.  No matter how many times you refuse to TL me or my guildmates, you cant get rid of that fact.  You werent on, it wasnt your fault.  I know that.  <br>
<br>
I WONT refuse to help an SoT person with a CR or let them in a group.  I wont refuse to summon a corpse because a few bad apples screwed it up for a really nice guy.  Taxero, it is sad to see you arent above that.  I always thought you were better than that.<br>

<br>
Good statement Mudder but if you want to say this to TAX then you have a long list of SOT haters to say this to also. For the first time yesterday in my EQ life I gritted my teeth as I ported a flamer with a druid alt of mines that I keep /anon, but the reason I gritted my teeth is because this person promised as long as he plays EQ he will never so much as to lift a finger to help/group/rezz/port any of us. I did it anyway because I said no matter what I won't stoop to the blackballers level.<br>
<br>
Although I ported that guy I see taxeros frustration in that everyone and their mother has the ok to treat us like complete s%hit and noone says anything or join in on the /ooc bashing of us and the whole zone find it noble to do so.<br>
<br>
And i find it odd that trompens brother have the communties approval to do whatever he can to kill or just make our lives as horrible as possible for as long as he can.<br>
<br>
<br>
Noones trying to sidetrack the subject or divert attention from SOT so when people say that its just amazing that people can say rumors on facts they dont know and when we respond its called diverting attention e.g. I read on another post that someone heard a rumor about SOT making jokes about the attacks on 9/11.......this in itself is just incredible that would be brung up in this situation because I'm in the military from NY and I had family members die in that event so why would I be in a guild that do that.<br>
<br>
So when you flame taxero for not porting your guildie do me a favor....the next time your in a zone and a SOT is  lfg or using /ooc and met with such nice comments and treatment you should flame that person like youd flame us for doing the same.<br>

I wanna clear something up for you.  I don't hate you. Why would I hate you? I don't hate anyone in SoT.  I find so many things about SoT disgusting, appalling, and dispicable but no, I do not hate them.<br>
<br>
I was explaining to those of SoT that wonder *why am I being black-balled?* *I'm a good person.*   I am fully aware of the fact that you and many others in SoT are probably *good People* however, and this is the big reason for my post about Live with it, you've earned it.<br>
<br>
I cannot think of 1 good reason to stay in a guild that brings on so many flames. If in fact your a good person why would you hang out with bad people? You could be in another guild and still hang with your friends (that are good people surrounded by those who are not).<br>
<br>
It's like a policeman belonging to the Hell's Angels. <br>
<br>
To clear that up let me ask this...Why do you stay? Is it the Lewts? Is it because you really have no fault with the actions your leaders take that causes the greater % of the Rathe to wanna spit in their eye?<br>
<br>
Let me clear this up too...I and a great many people have to believe it to be the latter. Simply stating; if you choose to stay with a guild that does things to be black-balled then you must believe in their actions thereby proving your one and the same. Afterall, if you truly believed it to be wrong you wouldnt stay right?<br>
<br>
If you were with friends that decided to rob a bank would you rob that bank with them because theyre your friends? I would hope not because if you stayed youd be a bank robber too.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying you were their in SF. I am saying your still in the guild that was so you must stand behind it right? Right, why else would you still be there?<br>

Strong and passionate, I tend to be misunderstood, sometimes even feared. I don't want to fight, I don't want to cause trouble, all I ask is a little love, and a little peace. If I don't get what I want, I get angry, and throw barrels and flaming oil at whatever's stopping me.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujajuan20.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jajuan20</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/26/02 1:36:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: If SoT is sorry will they stop the harrassment in tells?</span><hr size=1> &quot;I cannot think of 1 good reason to stay in a guild that brings on so many flames.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can't think of 1 good reason to bail on my because so and so don't like them.<br>
<br>
&quot;If in fact your a good person why would you hang out with bad people&quot;<br>
<br>
Now you say SOT are bad people and yet I know people who say they are good...who do I believe?....How about I make my own choices in EQ and please stop trying to get me to leave my guild because I will not bail on them.<br>
<br>
&quot;To clear that up let me ask this...Why do you stay? Is it the Lewts? Is it because you really have no fault with the actions your leaders take that causes the greater % of the Rathe to wanna spit in their eye?&quot;<br>
<br>
When I joined SOT I never intended on joining while times where good and bail as soon as the sh%t hits the fan and as far as is it the loot comment you obviously don't know me but ask anyone who does know me......no better yet I will tell you why I joined SOT...I joined because I got tired of seeing velks,seb and chardok and if I joined a high end guild it would be with one of my close friends (eksor,craksor).<br>
<br>
&quot;if you choose to stay with a guild that does things to be black-balled then you must believe in their actions thereby proving your one and the same. Afterall, if you truly believed it to be wrong you wouldnt stay right?&quot;<br>
<br>
If thats what you believe then so be it but I on more than one occasion said I didnt agree with what was done so if you wanna belive I agree with it and im out for self then cool black ball me because I wont hide what guild im in.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you were with friends that decided to rob a bank would you rob that bank with them because theyre your friends? I would hope not because if you stayed youd be a bank robber too&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok ill play your RL scenario game...I would not rob a bank with anyone but if you are my &quot;friend&quot; I wouldnt turn my back on you even in your moments of wrong doing.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not saying you were their in SF. I am saying your still in the guild that was so you must stand behind it right? Right, why else would you still be there?&quot;<br>
<br>
No I wasnt in SF and I'll say again for the hell of it...I don not agree with what happened in no way shape or form but I will not leave my &quot;friends&quot;. I will be with them during the best times and the worst as id expect a friend to do for me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Live with it, you've earned it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Feel free to hate me if you feel that way I welcome it never once did I ask to be treated different from my guild and I accept the punishment along with the tag over my head.<br>

<br>
I like you. You handle yourself in an amazing and most noble fashion. <br>
<br>
What I do not understand is how you can seperate the actions of your leaders and justify staying even though you dont agree with them.  How can you be part of anything with SoT feeling they have and could at any moment do something else that tarnishs SoT's and your rep by association?<br>
<br>
So Aiyanna, please tell me how you can do that? How you can associate with the people who make these decisions yet overlook them? <br>
<br>
And to go back to my RL scenerio. Ok so you didnt help your friends rob the bank but you call the bank robbing friend and say hey, wanna come over for supper tonight? I gotta great bottle of wine and a cool movie.  All the while knowing your good buddy was a bank robber? <br>
<br>
How can you see that person as friend material unless you actually do not see anything wrong with the bank being robbed as long as you didnt actually rob it?<br>
<br>
Please explain <p>There are many good reasons for drinking.
One just popped into my head.
If a man doen't drink while he's living;
How the hell can he drink when he's dead?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujajuan20.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jajuan20</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/26/02 3:32:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: If SoT is sorry will they stop the harrassment in tells?</span><hr size=1> I said I didnt agree with what happened in SF its a shame it was handled that way on all sides before during and after.And no my leadership arent loose cannons but obviously theres no way we can share the same opinion on this because of your views on SOT.<br>

&quot;And to go back to my RL scenerio. Ok so you didnt help your friends rob the bank but you call the bank robbing friend and say hey, wanna come over for supper tonight? I gotta great bottle of wine and a cool movie. All the while knowing your good buddy was a bank robber? <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
I would not pretend my friend did no wrong but he is my friend so what would most likely happen is I would talk to him about what hes done and see why he did it. If someone is my friend they are for a reason, I dont just go around looking for friends to pickup to feel important.<br>
<br>
I'll give you a EQ example. Pahraith left the guild which I dont agree with and I stayed which he don't agree with but because we are friends we both respect each others decisions, and all the time we have known eachother will not be down the drain because of this disagreement.<br>
<br>
<br>
I can go on and list all the great thing SOT has done and why I stay along with all the smaller guild we have helped but none of this wouldnt do any good because you feel a certain way about us and no answer I could give you would satisfy you. You dislike alot of things about SOT and I respect that.....please respect our choices in what guild we are in.<br>

<br>
Show me anyone that is going to handle getting KS'ed from a 6-7 day camp better than Trompen has.  The SHAME is that it occured at all, Aiyanna.  The action invited the rest.<br>
<br>
If SoT had shown up and helped Trompen, or just left it alone.. all you would have is the normal SoT flames that most ignored.  This was handled incorrectly by 1 person or multiple persons who took it upon themselves to take Ragefire without putting ANY time into camping that spawn of it. Zero, zilch. Nada. They got maximum reward for zero effort, and in the process, shat upon the person who had put in the effort.<br>
<br>
I have no issue with you defending your guild, it's to be expected.  I do have an issue trying to cloud who handled what poorly.  SoT had no business looking for Rage that day, it was plainly obvious that Trompen and others were there. That should have been enough.<br>
<br>
Sorry, this has been rehashed and stated and flamed and whatever.. but I seriously doubt you can &quot;straight-faced&quot; look at anyone other than the members of SoT who killed the dragon.. and say &quot;handled poorly&quot;. The rest was a reaction to an act of such utter bullshit proportions that it spawned that monster thread.<br>

<br>
I'd think this is not a matter of a true apology or not, in this stance i am not telling you all that the apology was a fake or just a gesture to the public. What I am goint to say is that this kind of matter needs to stop, immediately, no matter who was right and who was wrong. Knowing the past is part of the history, there is no reason why we should make the same mistake. Therefore, if any of you had issues with anybody, I'd urge you to rather fix the relationship other than worsening it. I know you two as well as Asmog and I know it was just a mistake.<br>

Didnt mean that the way it sounded. and no im not trying to pass blame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Show me anyone that is going to handle getting KS'ed from a 6-7 day camp better than Trompen has. The SHAME is that it occured at all, Aiyanna. The action invited the rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was a total shame it happened and I have known him for a while (beofre I was sot). Iwouldnt like this to happen to anyone.we can sit on these boards and say if SOT didn't do this and if that would have happened and keep this thread going for years to come but none of the ifs matter, what matters is that we make this bad situation up to him because your right, he shouldnt have to go through this.<br>
