<br>
we never said ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT VS<br>
read closely<br>
nothing about ragefire<br>
we have clerics on this list. this system is very nice and convenient for everyone to follow<br>
nothing about naggy/vox<br>
nothing about Sev<br>
nothing about trakanon<br>
nothing about wuoshi, dain, tormax, kael arena, lord bob, gorenaire, talendor, my mom<br>
<br>
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT VENRIL SATHIR<br>
now<br>
please have a little foresight on what will happen in a month, two months? six months? and then look how it is today<br>
<br>
today: 8+ guilds in a rotation that 12 people can kill..............<br>
tomarrow: 12+ guilds on a rotation that 12 people can kill............<br>
when SoL comes out: 20+ guilds on a rotation 6 people can kill............?<br>
<br>
why tho should this mob be controlled by a GUILD rotation<br>
why not keep Maestro GUILD rotated?<br>
why not put every mob on a GUILD rotation?<br>
because the top guilds don't care about his loot or they're in a semi-tough place to get to<br>
the whooooole risk vs reward<br>
<br>
it does NOT take a good raid to kill VS anymore. simply stated. yet you keep him on a rotation for the top guilds because of his loot.<br>
you, whether you pretend to be blind and just, are keeping anyone that Could host a VS raid for a multi-guild event away from his spawn<br>
<br>
i remember when LoS would spend a week up in the planes farming gear, so they started making calendars and rules and everyone was pissed because LoS didn't want it because they didn't want to give up their little spot<br>
<br>
now you guys are acting the same way refusing to give up your little spot that you Probably would not even rush to if it WAS FFA and became even Slightly of a hassle to bother with him. BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE PRETENDING TO BE JUST AND FAIR TO EVERYONE. at least LoS and other people admit they're just there because there's a valid risk vs reward reason to be there and no one is contending with them for it<br>
<br>
take a minute, please. to think about how much you and your guild would rush out to kill VS. and how, HONESTLY NOW, much you'd really bother..<br>
the first time you'd probably send someone to watch when he spawns.. after he spawns you may send out a few groups to see if you'll have to compete with him (if and only if you have the # online at the time)<br>
after this happens, and you have enough to go kill him, you set out to go kill him<br>
however, if there is already a significant # of people there for another guild, you'll either back off or keep pushing<br>
whoever feels killing VS is more important will get down first and engage him<br>
once you become the guild that does not feel his very important. you will stop at the part of &quot;see if you'll have to compete with another guild&quot; and not even bother<br>
<br>
after a week, or a month. you will be that guild that does not even care. after another week, or a month, all the guilds will loose track of his spawn time and slowly forget about jumping on the spawn. yet, somehow, i am sure there will always be at least a group of people assembling to kill him. and i am 99% sure no two groups will engage him at the same time.<br>
<br>
<br>
now, the closest mob in-game currently, that i can think of, to equate this to, is Lodizal<br>
we all know his spawn time (18 hours)<br>
we all know there's the chance we won't get him (he doesn't spawn sometimes)<br>
we all know he drops phat lewtz (yes, you knew that)<br>
we all know he's doable with a group or so (or 3 or 4 if you're a little lower level)<br>
we all know he's easy to get to (except people like me who always forget where those afskj ice pedals are)<br>
<br>
is this mob rotation? nope...<br>
why? several reasons i'm sure<br>
1) LoS isn't going to respect it because if they know he's up, they'll kill him since he's That easy =oP<br>
2) the lower guilds and unguildeds that know how easy he is will complain<br>
3) without a rotation it's harder for you to keep a timer on him<br>
(i'm sure there's a few more but you can add them here + justify them yourself)<br>
<br>
now, #3 takes care of itself<br>
VS being 3 days. you can keep his spawn in the 5pm-10pm time window. and the fact that he doesn't attack people without having to kill a bunch of mobs before you get to him (he's in a dungeon) makes it a little tougher to avoid<br>
#1 being sort of un-avoidable at this point. if LoS wants it, they're going to take it. and currently, i'm sure they wouldn't mind getting a few more shields/masks. but give it a few more months<br>
#2 probably being the kicker. multi-guild organizations and others know how easy lodizal is. and would be very upset if you did not give them a shot<br>
<br>
hopefully. once the smaller raiding groups that are your friends recognize how easy VS is. and how unfair the rotation is treating them, assuming they'd like a shot at his loot (and EC tunnel still says that's a yes!) then you probably won't do anything and keep him for yourselves<br>
and then once your friends ask you.. hey man, VS is so easy, why can't me and my friends take him out? you're not even giving us a shot just because we're not a large guild<br>
<br>
maybe you'll do something about it<br>
<br>
until then<br>
we'll sit in the rotation and /auction our spare legs in EC tunnel right next to you guys to pay for coffins and peridots<br>
<br>
/auction Singing Steel legs, 25kpp (kidding btw)<br>
<br>
sorry about the long post. you guys deserve it. i know you won't read it all anyway. just show us how much you care for the Luclin community! /cheer! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uyaencandyman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yaen Candyman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Werewolf</span><br>  Posts: 342<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/01 7:56:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=903.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> start here:<br>

you gotta be out of your mind if you want to keep non-guild organizations out of VS spawn<br>
for all the talk about fairness you do, it's pretty rediculous about how specifically fair you're becoming<br>
<br>
<br>
tell me: WHY should VS be a single-guild-only event or rotation<br>
<br>
i can understand trak because he actually takes decent #s + resist equip + a little listening<br>
but soon there will be the point where this just isn't fair to the people that simply cannot get the drops unless they mooch off a bigger guild, even if they could create a raid to take him out<br>

All these actions show the system needs some work. Dont blame everything on these guilds. <br>
<br>
Thats my only point. Stop arguing at them and work to make the system better. <br>
<br>
First, Serv causes alot of headaches. You shouldnt have a mob that much harder then VS be a test mob to get in rotation. And yes you can ask the other guilds to let you have  a shot at VS, but maybe its just me but I dont want to have to ask the ubers to kill a mob. <br>
<br>
Make the rules such that you dont have to ask any other guilds permission to get  into the rotation. <br>
<br>

the point is to give the top guilds the *say* in who gets to be in on the rotation<br>

besides that. you need a system that isn't guild-only inclusive. we're not talking about a God or Uber_mob. this takes 2-4 groups and just about 0 buff/break-in time <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ularuslasore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Larus Lasore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Pawn</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/01 9:13:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=903.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The state of VS and the rotation guilds</span><hr size=1> Hmm, surprised no one has led an open raid on VS yet. <br>

You pointed out yourself the reasons he can't compare to VS and be put on a rotation, the biggest being that he has a habbit of not popping. I for one would love to see him pop every single time and a fair rotation put in place, so we all can get masks and shields, but it isn't feasible do to the fact that for days in a row he can miss a spawn.<br>
<br>
As for keeping this we versus they mentality for the rotation guilds, I suggest you look at Heroes and IB who support adding guilds to the rotation when they are ready. This is not to keep guilds out but to keep it fair and friendly amonst the capable guilds. <p>Sjoc Straupp <BR> 53 rd Cavalier of Brell</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubambinogambino.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bambino Gambino</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Desert Madman</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/3/01 9:46:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=903.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The state of VS and the rotation guilds</span><hr size=1> Jerry!

Seems as if it's almost an anti-LoS thing, and you are shifting the focus to the little shits with poor leadership known as Ancient Crusade.<br>

Please clear up for us the official LoS position, does LoS want FFA or rotation?  If you do want rotation, please tell us best way you think to do it.<br>

<br>
I must admit, this was the easiest guild I've ever played. Just stupid. Really poor decisions.<br>
<br>
Now comes along AC.. another weak guild with visionary type leaders who can't make decisions worth @#%$.<br>
<br>
And here we are !<br>
<br>
What do *I* think we should do about it? Hmm, I'll pretend for a moment anyone here gives a rats ass about my opinion, instead of what im capable of. Okay, done.<br>
<br>
I think larger guilds (Endo/Triad/LoS) should be allowed two shots at VS for every one of the smaller guilds. More capability, more strength. Survival of the fittest? Hardly. Consider it common curtiosy..<br>
<br>
Of course this leads to other guilds mass recruiting or growing in obvious strength and then complaining about not being on the two shot rotation. And of course determining through a mass of impossible to please people which guilds should actually be put on such a rotation. Nobody who isn't on top would agree with it. Bickering.. &quot;my guild killed Sev with 26 people, and we just did Ragefire with one death!&quot;. I can see it now.. <br>
<br>
But then again, I never thought the rotation would survive with more than three guilds on it.<br>
<br>
Oh well.<br>
<br>
I don't particuarlly like AC or Vos (incase you didn't notice) and it has nothing to do with their members. Their leadership just really sucks.<br>
<br>
A rotation is fine with me if you leave those two out of it.<br>
<br>
I'll make this clear: LoS is still interested in VS. How interested? Well now, if I answered that.. you'd take advantage. This is the most I'll ever post on this subject btw. You asked for my opinion and you got it.<br>
<br>
But who am I?<br>
