<br>
While I certainly support them cracking down on people hacking the game, I think that &quot;exploits&quot; aren't quite the same thing. These are bugs they have written into the game or not taken out of the game. No, it is not right to take advantage of such things when you know they are bugs. But the 'exploits' they nailed Conquest for... come on. Res effects not allowing the AE breath weapon to hit? Hiding healers out of line of sight and using Call of the Hero to reset their aggro? Sounds like tactics to me. How is someone who didn't write the code going to know that that is a bug and not intended? Next they'll say that Rune stopping Lifetap is an exploit. Let's face it, there's only certain ways you can kill some mobs like Vox or Venril Sathir... the other ways are suicide. Applaud guys like Conquest for finding these &quot;bugs&quot; and then hire them to TEST the damn buggy software. <br>
<br>
Pathing bugs are EQ's problem.... they've had 2 years to perfect their pathing routines, and they still can't get it right. <br>
<br>
Bottom line, watch yourselves out there and know you could be next. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I also do not think it'd make much sense to take a poll on it.  That'd be like taking a poll on how many people want to pay income taxes, or social security.  Of course most of the player base really could care less if people are exploiting.  The question isnt whether or not we care, but if Verant does have a point in people using exploits ruining it for the rest of us.  And I would tend to agree that the use of exploits do harm the game, even if many of us dont see it.<br>
<br>
The main problem is that they do not enforce their exploit rules very well, its really kind of random, and frankly many of us DONT know if we're exploiting or not till we get a warning.  Its a bit late once you get a soulmark.  Since there are so many exploits out there, if Verant decided to go on an enforcement binge you could easily wind up suspended or banned in short order.  <br>
<br>
Now my concern here was that in the past Verant has taken the stance that warnings officially posted on the forums can be considered your only warning.  IE taking advantage of exploits on dragon runs.  Now ordinarily I wouldnt care really.  But, from my read Verant is going to be entering a period of increased enforcement of what they consider to be exploits.  Take what happened to Conquest.  I is my personal belief that they werent looking to just stop some exploiters.  They were looking for an example.  The real clincher in my mind was the disbandment of the entire guild.  It's rather doubtful that the 28 people involved made up the majority of the guild.  Simple bannings and suspensions should have been enough.  The disbanding of the guild to me says they want us players to take this seriously.  As such, I think we can expect to see much tighter policing in the near future.  <br>
<br>
Now this is just the unformulated ramblings of a non-guilded druid.  So take it how you will.  This was mainly posted to inform other guild leaders and officers who might not have read this that they too might be targeted in the future and to be careful.  If it can happen to Conquest it can certainly happen to other guilds.  Just because we dont take on Zladicar, PoM, or the Dain doesnt mean your guild and members can be made examples as well.<br>

One of the biggest thing to understand about this issue is pathing.  And more specifically pathing in dungeons.  Necors are the masters at fear kiting and pathing plays a &quot;HUGE&quot; role in ones ability to fear kite especially in a dungeon.  A normal mob never runs directly at you ina dungeon and i have used this to my advantage(its the same in outdoor zones too by the way)  however i would not consider this an exploit as i use snare and running to put sufficient distance between myself and a monster so that i may cast again.  However i have read the Conquest files fully and i think i understand what they did.  Frankly i have little to no experience in high level encounters.  However i know this much.  The key to winning all high level encounters is keeping the dragon in place and the healers safe.  Frankly i believe Conquest used a major exploit by keepint the warder in the EXACT SAME PLACE for 15 minutes so that they could set up adn then it stayed there for the fight.  Forget the whole verant argument about jumping off the bridge and just think about how nice it would be for an uber mob to stay in the same place for the entirety of the fight.  IT is an exploit and it does cheapen the game.  However in my opinion (as a computer programmer) it is due to poor programming and people should not be punished for doing these things, rather my 10 bucks a month should go towards fixing these errors instead of making martyrs out of the ones that make them publicly visible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Founder</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(6/14/01 9:15:54 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Exploits, Dragons, and Us?</span><hr size=1> I think that the Conquest files state that the dragon wasn't standing in place for the actual fight per se, but for the 15 minutes after aggro was acquired but before the fight took place. At least that's what I inferred. And let's face it you could do the same with Vox. If you pull from the lair, but don't damage Vox (or Nagafen) she will aggro and just run to the door looking for someone to bite. Both dragons will then cast their fear spell (which reaches into the buffing area) and you could potentially buff the whole time that the dragon is aggroed, as the dragon won't summon until it's damaged. The fear is a pain in the butt, and you don't want to fight the dragon with its head in the door, so you camp to clear aggro. Is that an exploit? Is going to a chat room so the buffs don't wear off an exploit? These are tactics that work, and expecting people not to use them is like giving a beggar food and expecting him not to eat unless he sits at the table. <br>

I had a thought while talking to someone the other day, I think it was Flarren...<br>
<br>
So... an exploit is anything that doesn't allow the mob to fully use it's abilities...  right?<br>
<br>
So... but that definition, wearing a whole bunch of Fire Resist gear is an exploit when you fight Nagafen, right?  Because when you have a whole buncha fire resistance, he sure can't use his AE fire spell to full effect on you every time.<br>
<br>
So... Verant, should we not allow resistance gear on our raids now?  How about buffs?  Can we use those?  They make it so the critter can't kill us as easily as if we were naked and un-buffed.  Speaking of which, if I have my armor on when I'm fighting a mob, it doesn't hit me nearly as hard as when I'm armor-less... so is wearing armor an exploit?  You see where I'm going with this?  That definition of exploitation is ridiculous.<br>
<br>
If a player finds a tactic that keeps a mob from using it's abilities to it's fullest, good for them!  If you think it's exploiting a game bug - change the mob!<br>
<br>
I've been an admin and developer on a MUD for almost 10 years now, and one thing I will tell you is this:  Bugs are part of every game.  It is the responsibility of the game administrators to fix them when they find them... not to simply start nuking player accounts because the players found a tactic that works really well against something you created. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

But it misses the fine line that Verant is treading.<br>
<br>
A mob should be able to use its full powers against all the people involved.  It doesnt say anything that those powers must hit for effect.  But they must be able to use it and they must have a chance of having an effect.  The point on the Vox/Naggy raids is that the AE fear is actually LOS, like all AE spells.  Solid wall objects will block it, which is why Vox needs to be close to the door to her lair in order to actually hit the buff hall.  However, heal spells are NOT Line of Sight and you can heal through walls.  Anyone with Hate experience knows how fun this is.  It isnt about whether or not you take damage or those spells actually effect you, but rather that they must be able to land on you if you are within range.  For example MR to prevent fear is a tactic because its possible for the fear to land even if its low, conversly using Rez effects to actually prevent a slow spell from taking effect is and exploit because the res effects prevent stacking.  It might be a bug, but its still an exploit.  <br>
<br>
As I stated earlier right or wrong is not the point of this.  But rather what Verant would consider an exploit.  And they are on record as saying keeping the healers back where the AE spells cannot hit you due to geography, even if you are in range, is an exploit.  Also, it has no bearing on the fact whether or not Verant has or has not enforced this rule on the Dragons.  They have stated in public they consider this to be an exploit and can/will enforce it at their convience.  I would further point out they do not have to be fair or reasonable or even consistant.  They make the rules and they enforce them.  Whether we think its right or wrong is irrelevant.  But I think just saying that your not exploiting because the fault is with Verant is just hiding your head in the sand.  Yes, it is Verant's responsibility to change bugs, but according to the EULA it is also our responsibility not to take advantage of them till they do fix it.<br>
<br>
Now the true concern here has been that Verant has always been content to simply issue warnings and zone boot people for exploits.  Only if you had a number of warnings did you get suspended or banned.  However, what makes the Conquest situation somewhat unique is that the entire guild was disbanded.  Even though only about half the members of the guild were even involved in the situation.  The point I'm trying to warn everyone about which they are apparently missing is that Verant apparently will not hesitate to hold your ENTIRE guild responsible for the acts of a few if they're using exploits.  If it doesnt matter much to you, I would at least think it should matter to those who might find themselves guildless even though they had nothing to do with the event in question.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to be rude or anything with this.  But I get the feeling here that people are not taking this very seriously.  Now it can be said that Verant wont try this on Karana where everyone sticks up for each other, but once again I think thats just hiding from the facts.  Sure people will stick up for each other here, but that really wont make a difference to their decision.  Verant has never held popularity contests before when making a decision.  Anyone remember the big flap with Fires of Heaven and AfterLife when they broke into PoM?  I dont recall anyone standing up for Verant on that one, yet it sure didnt stop them.  <br>
<br>
Oh well, I'm probably getting way too worked up over this.  Heh, we're all adults here capable of taking information and making our own informed decisions without my help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   In fact, it has been proven that my advice isnt always right either, so who knows.  It could be I'm just blowing this out of propotion too.
