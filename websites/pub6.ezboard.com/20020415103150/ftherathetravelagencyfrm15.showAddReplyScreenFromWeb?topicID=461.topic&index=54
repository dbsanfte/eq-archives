I'll talk out of guild now, if Shei had not openly apologized more would have left SoT, not because Shei was solely to blame, but because the public outcry was so big that it was the only way to ever make a chance at making amends, and not many felt comfortable with this situation, Shei was right for writing that apology, for his guild and towards the public, if you wish to discard his apology as a forced apology then that is your view.<br>
Anyone care to show me when Shei has ever apologized before in public? Even before when SoT was being attacked Shei refrained from comments. This time he stood up and did the right thing. That says something in my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukaradin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/25/02 10:18:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=461.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fine as far as it goes...</span><hr size=1> &quot;if you wish to discard his apology as a forced apology then that is your view.&quot;<br>

&quot;if Shei had not openly apologized more would have left SoT&quot;, <br>
<br>
<br>
That isn't forced how?<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes Shei made an apology, forced though it was, and that is a first.  Another first was demonstrated in Dwallyn's log: just how little respect many of you have for the rest of us playing on*your* server.<br>
<br>
Let's hope that along with the apology comes a change in attitude towards your fellow players.  I'm eternally hopeful, but not holding my breath.<br>

No one has denied the content of Dwallyn's /gu log, and that is the most damning part of this whole thing.  Alot withheld opinions or any real sort of judgement until that surfaced.<br>
<br>
The attitude conveyed in that log was more than enough to color any apology as simply a backhanded attempt.  Yeah, it's great that you folks are stepping up and saying &quot;we did bad&quot;.. but I seriously doubt most of the community of this server is going to forgive anything until Trompen is holding a sprinkler, and likely won't forget this incident for a long, long time.<br>
<br>
Speaking for myself... I had no real negative or positive opinion of SoT or it's leadership. I have to say plainly were I to actively play EQ again, I would certainly mistrust your motives in most anything we were both involved in.<br>
<br>
I guess what I am saying is.. Saying Sorry isn't going to go very far right now... It's going to take alot of &quot;Demonstration through Deeds&quot; before anyone starts giving you the benefit of the doubt about your intentions.<br>

What you posted, both on the RTA and in our members board showed, imo at least, that you wanted your moment of fame, and you had no decency to come to us, your guild, first with your issues, but you would rather turn your back on the supposed friends you had in this guild.<br>
<br>
I haven't been on much lately, and I wasn't there when this happened, however reading your posts on the RTA *before* you posted trying to solve anything on our boards makes me lose any respect that I would have for you. Don't come asking for an apology, we want nothing to do with people that are only out for themselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
[q]Standing by and defending your guild during a &quot;trying time&quot; is commendable. Supporting one where the leadership is corrupt and incapable of common decency is not.[/q]<br>
<br>
The leadership is corrupt and incapable of common decency? I have been in SoT for over 2 years, and know every one of those leaders very well.. and that comment is just unfounded. Sure, you can read a log (and to be honest, I skimmed through it, didn't read every detail) and think you know all about a person, but you don't. Shei is a good leader, whether you like him personally or not. You may think he commands us and we just follow orders, but that is so not the case. In fact, I would think it is a more relaxed leadership compared to some other guilds who when the leader says something they do it, and don't think twice. That is not the case. Yes, to be a good leader I think you have to be a tough-ass at times, and Shei does that, but to say that he is corrupt and what-not just proves you don't know him, or any of the other leaders.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udembiredeadbones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dembire Deadbones</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/25/02 11:33:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=461.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dwallyn..</span><hr size=1> I'm a little confused, by the logs, it seems to me that having the guildmotd saying what it did, it was a planned KS, especially with Nyca knowing who was camping RF.  RF was being kited by CON already as said in the logs so CON had engaged RF so it is KS'ing outright that SOT did, please correct me if i am mistaking.  I don't think an apology is enough because that does not make up for the time trompen lost.  I am a very rare poster, but i read these eboards all the time, but i remember HC being flamed all the time because of the leadership with SOT being right in there, how is this different?<br>
I think every cleric on the rathe is affected because it delays their time to camp RF and every smaller guild are gonna have to keep looking over their shoulders in hopes that they will not be KS'd as well.  No apologies can fix that, trust is earned not granted.    <br>
Trompen I wish you didn't have to go through the hell you have been through , you are a great person.  Trompen was at tha RF camp last Saturday and Sunday and rezzed myself and my group a number of times without accepting a donation and he volunteered after i ooc for help.  It  saddens me to see someone as giving as trompen to be screwed like he was.  I also feel for the good people in SOT who had nothing to do with this incident but will have a tough time now because of what the leadership and followers of them had done that day. <p><b>Dembire Deadbones<br>

<br>
Malidar you say Dwallyn showed a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  lack of pride in guild, and lack of interest in guild </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I really fail to understand how you come to this conclusion? Dwallyn got himself a reputation on these very boards for defending SoT, he stayed with SoT through thick and thin, while we were flamed by BoTs (rightly or wrongly) and others. As for a lack of interest in SoT well that makes me laugh, does staying up until 5 and 6am many nights to help SoT clear NToV (for example) show a lack of interest? does helping folk with epics, quests and 1 million other things show a lack of interest? <br>
<br>
The facts are this:<br>
<br>
SoT decided to kill RF, Dwallyn did not agree, neither did I, but as the  more vocal of the two, he was more outspoken.  In guildchat and tells he was protesting over the formation of a force to kill this camped mob. He was ignored, he was criticised.<br>
<br>
After the kill he again shows his disgust, logs posted here only show a small time frame but if he posted them all they show harsh criticism of the fact that both he and I thought that what happened was wrong, this came from more than a few and included leaders and officers.<br>
<br>
Nine hours after the kill and unable to sleep Dwallyn posts on the RTA, he is not posting in anger he in posting in honor and he is telling the Rathe the truth, that was his right. <br>
<br>
The next morning we log on to a discussion about us in guildchat, we are dirt, we are filth, for Dwallyn did the unthinkable and broke rank. The previous day Dwallyn was told specifically NOT to post on the RTA, this is a SoT tatic for deflating flames thats why you don't see more SoT posts because after any SoT incident Shei or Thundaron tell all members not to post.<br>
<br>
By this time we are still guildtagged and thinking about our position in SoT, neither of us are happy with what SoT has done and are even less happy about how pleased they feel with themselves , the gloating and self rightiousness is sickening.<br>
<br>
We are bashed and bashed and bashed, told we are wrong time and time again. We believe that we are right and that what SoT did was wrong. <br>
<br>
After a lot of discussion and a lot of thinking we decide to leave the guild, I am upset in RL because I know I am losing a guild that I loved and friends that I cherished.  But I feel I cannot stay any longer with a guild whose leadership is so wrong. I hope in my heart that the friends that I made in SoT will remain my friends for I am still the same person I was before I disagreed with what the guild did. I am the same cleric who rezed you with a smile, who laughed with you and cryed with you. But I know and I feel that after such a harsh flaming by SoT of me and Dwallyn for our belief in the truth that things will never be the same again.<br>
<br>
The easiest thing for Dwallyn and I to do would have been to keep our heads down and say nothing, remain with SoT, take the loot and let it ride over our heads.  We have more dignity and pride than that. But it was us who were going to be the losers , losing guild and friends.<br>
<br>
Turns out in the end SoT now think we were right.  Killing RF WAS a bad thing, now how the hell do you think that makes us feel? who is going to turn round and honestly and truthfully say to me and Dwallyn, we are sorry you were right?<br>
<br>
I was upset when we left and Dwallyns goodbye post on SoTs boards was not the nicest he could have made. SoT criticised him for that no end, but what about the insults we got the tells we got, the nasty words SoT members said to us because we believed the RF killing to be wrong? its ok for you guys to insult us but not the other way round?<br>
<br>
My goodbye post was different and I wrote it with tears in my eyes, yes you say this is just a game don't be silly.  It is , but the friendships we form are with real people not pretend ones, thats what makes EQ so addictive in the first place.<br>
<br>
At this time SoT are still saying they are right and to be honest Malidar it was your post (and a request from someone asking him to prove what he was claiming) saying that RF was mezzed for 25 minutes before engagement that prompted him to post logs. Those logs could have been much worse, to start with he could have named members, he didn't, he could have left in things that were said out of context (for example Brumpy laughs at one point at something else and it could be seen to be that he was laughing at the RF thing but he wasn't) It was those logs and those logs only that made Shei post an apology and you know how I know? because friends of mine still IN SoT told me so, the guild knew without a doubt that without proof of wrong doing (like all the other times) the RF flame would die down and go away. One person is even quoted as saying &quot; <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  this one won't go away like the others, DW posted logs on the RTA </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> &quot;<br>
<br>
It very hard for the honest and good members of SoT atm they are been all lumped together, everyone including me refers to SoT and people think it means them, it doesn't mean all of them for some are great people, but its hard to name all names and to single people out as good and bad is not fair.<br>
<br>
Tinol, my husband has more honor and more dignity in his little toe than many will ever have in a life time. YOU and others like you presume too much. Its easy now for you to say, oh he was always a trouble maker blah blah, NO what he was and is, is an honest man not afraid to speak the truth, if that makes him a trouble maker then so be it.<br>
<br>
To answer your question about why I am married to him in real life (not that I should have to) I will tell you this:<br>
<br>
Craig (Dwallyn) is the most tender, honest, loving, selfless, dignified and honorable person I have ever met.

Malidar learn some of the dignity that your father has, hes a good man and has been of great support to  me in tells <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And to the Rathe, THANKYOU, for my loss of friends in SoT has been a gain of friends on the Rathe, thanks for the hundreds of tells, strangers coming over from other servers (amazing) people who I have never met, or spoken to sending Dwallyn and I tells of friendship and support have helped us through this.<br>
<br>
Thanks also to my friends in SoT who stood by me (you know who you are !) and also to Noble Blade and Vof who we have joined on raids these past few nights for your wonderful support and kindness (oh and before you JUMP on them, we made it clear we had no intention of joining any guild at present, so don't think they were just recruiting)<br>
<br>
I knew you would try and deflect the focus of what happened from YOU onto Dwallyn, we expected that.<br>
<br>
SoT need to be allowed to make amends, for Trompen and anyone sending nasty tells (either side) should stop.  Its not your average SoT members fault this has happened. <br>

I will ask this of you.<br>
<br>
Please do not say &quot;we&quot; when referring to SoT.<br>
<br>
You have made your discussion.<br>
<br>
I can post &quot;selective&quot; logs of a 5 minute conversation, to make anyone look bad. But what you will never see are ALL the conversations that took place over these past few days.<br>
<br>
As for people being asked NOT to post here. It is logical. Once a flame starts, no matter what is done to discuss you have &quot;The Flamer, the Flamee and 100people who just want to stop and feel important in posting&quot;. <br>
<br>
Look at how things are progressing here. The first 100 posts are saying &quot;how come SoT is not apologizing?&quot;. I come here and I do, then people say my apology means crap and is forced? It will just steamroll in no matter what we do, hell even if we could get the Epic transferred? what then? I will see the &quot;Well, it was not sincere..it was forced&quot;<br>
<br>
Lohki,<br>
I said what I said for this reason alone. Your GM made it known that they would not support a RF rotation. From and outsider standpoint one afk cleric..and then 2 guilds port in who both say they would not support a RF rotation. Reminds me of 2 giants in a sandbox. Myga...I thought it was going to turn into another Myga incident, with kiters and such. So if you have any comments regarding this statement. It was made by ME.<br>
<br>
If people wish to come talk to me about my comments here<br>
<br>
I play on the Rathe Server and I only play Tzuten, Ranaz. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthundaron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thundaron</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/25/02 1:14:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=461.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fine as far as it goes...</span><hr size=1> Saying that i would not post an apology unless the logs had been posted is incorrect for those who think it.<br>
<br>
As members of CON can testify i tried to handle things with them that night, before logs were posted, before dwallyn left the guild even auctually.<br>
<br>
What i was trying to do was gather as much information on what happened, ie: how long he was up, what was said who was there first etc before i made my post so i could attempt to show why the members of sot did what i personally felt was wrong.<br>
<br>
That information that i needed was not posted on private SOT boards untill today, was i to wait untill today to make an apology?  No, i did it before because i feel what happened was wrong.<br>
<br>
Saying that i posted it to Cover my ass i personally find insulting as con members can tell you i apologized to them long before it got to this point. <p><center>

<br>
<br>
As I said in the other thread, nowhere have I posted NB would walk over another guild camping Ragefire.  Each and every time, I have been very clear what it is we objected to in (odd you don't support a list sponsored and posted by Nycah, one of your own) Nycah's list.  Our objection was to a 3 month long scheduled rotation that offered LESS access rather than more opportunities, and allowed the propspective campers have less flexibility in taking time off work to camp it (should they choose to do with).  Every single time I posted, that if it was camped, NB would leave it alone.  Every time.<br>
<br>
An additional point I would make is that CoN *was* camping it, and from the non-SoT evidence (read: Pulgray and Trompen), he wasn't afk.  So, it was camped, and yet you still assumed NB was there to KS it so you had to KS it first?  Makes no sense we would help Imhotep get his epic, but then KS Trompen, his guildmate.  /boggle<br>
<br>
As for your claim that anyone can be made to look bad by taking 5 min of out of context conversation - I find that hardly applicable here.  Re-read Dwallyn's logs, they aren't &quot;out of context&quot;.  Really re-read them Tzuten, re-read them as a member of the Rathe, not an SoT officer.  You will never see comments like that in 95% of the Rathe's guilds /gu, and certainly not mine.<br>

It's a touchy issue.<br>
<br>
There are quite a few of you in SoT that I hunted with thru the years.  Some of you I was even family with in previous guilds.<br>
<br>
It's just I'm so upset about the turn of events here and I have a hard time being calm when things like this happen.<br>
<br>
1) Being ignored by SoT members just prior to their engagement of RF.<br>
<br>
2) Being one of those responsible for setting up a *cough* KS *cough* group to take RF away from CoN.  That was just a lame excuse by SoT involved to justify their own actions.<br>
<br>
3) Watching SoT attempt to whitewash the affair early on.<br>
<br>
4) Watching SoT continue to try and PR spin this into history as they have done so many times in the past.<br>
<br>
Again, I apologize for making that brash statement that blankets all of SoT.  I'm sure there are some of you that do not share the same attitude that others in SoT do.<br>
<br>
This whole thing became a nuclear incident because SoT refused to communicate their intentions.  Ignorance would have been the name of the game until Galudin posted the guildchat and brought everything to light.  Of course he has paid the price.  A whisteblower does the right thing at a great price.  Takes a lot of guts.  I'm sure he has caught nothing but h*ll from SoT since.  But then he made his bed.<br>
<br>
To be honest, the only true solution I see to cleaning up this mess is for GM leadership to talk to the server GM and officially request a transfer of epic to Trompen.  I just see a bigger mess if SoT tries to do otherwise.<br>
<br>
I don't know if the server GM will or can do this, but it would be reassuring to a lot of us if SoT did sincerely try.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the server as a whole sees this as the final straw in arrogance and attitude.  SoT has a mountain of work to do to get over this and gain any respect back on the server.<br>
<br>
Only time will tell.<br>
