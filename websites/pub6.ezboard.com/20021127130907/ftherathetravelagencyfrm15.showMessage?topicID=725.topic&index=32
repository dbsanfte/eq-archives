Chances are, it will just inspire them to spend more time in these zones, or stop playing altogether. If it only inspires them to stay in these zones longer, well..yeah, it punishes them as well as whomever the content is designed for.<br>
<br>
When you head off to somewhere more difficult to grind exp, you have to pay attention.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you can form up a group of lower levelers and spend your time soaking up most of their exp while pulling half the zone...I guess....<br>

<br>
So you've never been killed in seb? Never had to CR Chef?<br>
<br>
Sometimes the challenge of mobs is not *just* the mob, but also the location and the people in the area. People that used to go to CT, are the people that are usually very skilled at their class, know what to do and when. Don't get me wrong, people who go to seb are like that too, but here's the hitch now: Everyone from seb and velks who figures out that the XP in groups is now A$$ flavored, will head to CT (among others), for the higher level mobs. <br>
<br>
Sometimes Seb is hard because of the group you are in. The group that has 6 people and still doesn't move from the zone in for an hour, we've all been in that group at one time or another. The group that takes half an hour to CR to guard. The group that REQUIRES CR in guard. You get my point. <br>
<br>
Put that same group in Cazic thule? Hell no. Hell no. <br>
<br>
Anyway, Personally, I like bigger mobs for grinding on, hell, I'd XP in ToV if it wasn't so damned slow per mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Removing the xp on the lowers was dumb; no question. Upping the XP on the bigger mobs? Good call. Too bad they f'ucked the execution of a good idea. <br>
<br>
Not VERANT? NEVER! <br>
<br>
Anyway, if they fix it, good. If they don't, well, I like the game for raiding now, not for levelling. I feel quite bad for those who didn't make 60 by now though, really. <br>
<br>
Hopefully Verant will pull their head out soon.<br>

<br>
Dosent mean I enjoy EQ less then you.<br>
<br>
And while I agree that this change can be slightly good by forcing people to do more challenging mobs...keep in mind how many level 60s there ARE and how few viable for xp level 55+ mobs there are.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that this is the death of most soloers except for the traditional necro, druid wizard.  There's many people in my AFK situation where grouping would hurt the other group members because of the need to AFK a lot, among other reasons.<br>
<br>
While I HAVE the ability to solo 20Khp + mobs in UP with reasonable downtime, many people do not. This is the death knell for the non uber monk, rogue, warrior etc soloing in FG or Katta, as a barely blue mob is all they CAN take.<br>
<br>
They need to keep the rewards for higher level mobs, but return to the previous xp level for low blues.  The REAL powerlevellers will still head to the 4 arm camps in ME or UP or WW for the better xp.<br>

<br>
Uhm, take the shaman part out of that. A soloing shaman has not been effected with this patch in regards to their technique. A shaman has 3 DOTS - Poison/Disease/Epic which prior to patch all stacked with eachother. <br>
<br>
Kinda annoys me tho that they made these experience adjustments. When i get home from work i only have a couple hours to play, so i will LFG in seb for about 10 minutes (rather then 1-2 hours) and if i can't get a group then i am off running to howling stones to solo in there. This is basically going to make my HS fun worthless because of the reduced experience. <br>
<br>
I feel that this penalizes those of us whose EQ time is limited - guess Verrant doesn't want 'our' kind of money..  <p><b>

<br>
1- Druids have long been asking for better heals.  Warriors now can reach 6k and more.  Mobs now have millions of HP and do 2000 and up damage in a round.  Druids heals have still done the same ammount of life, basically making us less and less effective in raid situations.<br>
<br>
I (speaking from a druid point of view) do not have a problem being a back-up in a raid.  But I do have a problem being an in-effective back-up.<br>
<br>
This game is designed, as VI has said before, as made for co-op gaming and high-end raid encounters.  What do druids contribute to high-end encounters? Not terribly much, so its only fair that VI give druids a little something more to work with once they get into the high-end raiding game.<br>
<br>
For the druid argueing earlier (sorry I forgot your name <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) what is the point of quad-ing to level 60? What do you plan to do after that? Quad to 100AA? Than what? Go on raids and sit there doing nothing? Heh.  Not to attack you, sorry, just asking you what the point of all that leveling is.<br>
<br>
So I am all for druids being less effective in soloing and more effective in groups/high-end encounters.<br>
<br>
2-  The exp being reduced on lower levels mobs is dumb.  I was hoping they were trying to make high-end raids more experience worth it.  I.e. killing mobs in ToV all day might yield something more than a couple of pieces of armor.<br>
<br>
Hell, after this patch I can see PoF and PoH turning into exp zones on non-reserved days, heh.<br>
<br>
3- The cleric hammer, @#%$ dumb, sorry.  A lvl 60 cleric friend of mine was buffed by a shaman with Focus, Primal Essence, Avatar and Celerity.  With these buffs she procced EVERY OTHER attack, that is 150DD every other swing (about).  I am sorry, but that is a hellalotta damage for a cleric to do in melee.  I doubt my 54 monk would beable to outdamage a 56 cleric with the same shaman buffs at this point.<br>
<br>
What was the point of making clerics able to solo better? Why would a cleric need to solo? They can get a group almost anytime they are looking, much less than I can say for alot of melees out there.<br>
<br>
4- Some of the things they did in the patch were good however.  Some of the new spells are hear are really nice.  <br>
<br>
The new 'link_an_item_to_chat' thing is pretty cool, mute when compared to the experience problems, but cool anyways.<br>
<br>
5- No comment on the resists thing, havent played my druid since the patch to test it.<br>
<br>
Hrm, anyways, thats about it for now.<br>

<br>
Somehow, I got the impression these exp changes and class changes were made becuase they were needed for the upcoming expansion.<br>
<br>
As for the change to resists...  I don't know.  My knowledge is that druid spells always had problems with being resisted.  I forget if druids could mag or fire (or whatever) debuff a mob to make Winged Death stick better.  I do remember reading that debuffs are supposed to work better now.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
The only time I really work on exp is when I'm with a ready made group.  I hate Velks and Seb, and all those easy sit back and relax leveling zones.  For me, CT has been the best place to get exp when I hit 59.  I can't wait to try to get some AA points there now that I'm level 60.  My friends and I look forward to the extra exp that we hope to get on the mobs there.<br>
<br>
My friends and I quit going to HS after we were about level 58.  By then, most of the mobs at zone in, and the first couple wings were beginning to be light blue.<br>
<br>
Soloing in DL....  All I can say is my level 40 necro solos mobs in DL.  When my pally was between the levels of 48 and 50, he soloed in DL.  If you're around level 51 to 53, you might try soloing mobs in BW.  That is where I took my pally when he hit 51 (there were just too many light blues in DL at that point).<br>
<br>
