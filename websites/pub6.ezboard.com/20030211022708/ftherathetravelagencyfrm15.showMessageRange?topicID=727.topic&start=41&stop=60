Just for the record, do us all a favor and don't offer to port anyone in Steel Talons of Rathe. Being a respectable guild we don't like to associate with your ilk.  Hell, you've been on OUR hate list for almost a year now! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Oh and, please, keep trying to pass off too ED that we are bad mouthing you for turning us down for ports, I am sure they are going to buy that one forever.  ROFLMAO <br>
<br>
You make your name, and your name is @#%$ on The Rathe, it is just a matter of time before everyone knows it.  So many do now. As for me and mine, we do our best to spread the good word, brother.  Have a nice day!<br>

In that exchange we were discussing the fact that doing a /report with some text where the person admits doing something stupid.  He indicated that most people were able to not say the wrong thing since it's typed and easy to parse prior to hitting enter.  It was my response that idiots don't think to parse their statements and since the people that do these things are... well.... idiots then it seems to me that it's usually pretty easy.<br>
<br>
So here we have one.<br>
<br>
Fablaar said:<br>
I'll admit, I was an ass in my previous posts, but that guy pissed me off flaming about me ninja looting when he really got ksed. <br>
<br>
Of course his first post indicated that Scaleslayer had some anger management problems which is ironic to say the least.<br>
<br>
As well, he came back with a &quot;redeeming tone&quot; evidenced by that statement yet claims not to care.  No one has ever seen that behavior before.<br>
<br>
The sad part is that he not only violated the customary fairness we enjoy on The Rathe but also the not so pretty PNP rules of Verant.  He admitted it and doesn't see anything wrong with that.    <br>
<br>
He still has his friends he says.  They know &quot;he's not like that&quot; yet he has admitted it.  So a heads up to those &quot;friends&quot;.  If you don't know he's like that, you do now.<br>
<br>
May the good fortune you bestow follow you always.<br>

Does it make it right?     No<br>
<br>
95% of the time that I have been KSed it has usually been because of a misunderstanding, didn't realize I was kiting, it was rooted or they thought I needed help. In all those cases even when they were higher level group of people I've messaged them and talked it over and usually came to an aggreement or understanding.<br>
<br>
I've seen your type before though Fablaar and I don't fall for it anymore. They are the type that go off spouting how they are better and more powerful and was in the right because it was done to them before. Then after he finds out that there are a lot of people who I've just went on their hate list, he comes back and in a civil tone tries to apologize. I'm sorry I was upset and distraut because his post hurt my feelings because I'm a decent person, all my friends and I know the real truth. I was only mouthing off because I was roleplaying (I love it when people say I was just roleplaying being a jerk). Funny never seen you in roleplaying mode before, oh wait could it be because you weren't and really... well everyone else has already gone there :)<br>
<br>
The reason we have an RTA board is because might and strength does not make right. If that was the case every high powered guild would be going after every mob at the same time, creating utter chaos training and other major problems. Hence the creation of sometype of order and general etiquette when playing. Just because we are playing a game, which we all pay to have fun, and not talking face to face doesn't give people the right to just be overall jerks and rude. Sure there are people like that out there, but does it make it right? No! Just like sure you've been KSed and sucked it in but then you go and KS someone else. It doesn't matter wether its KS or Ninja'd its still impolite and rude even if its happen to us before. With that type of thinking, I guess I'll just start KS, Training and Ninja everything... in fact I won't even rezz anyone anymore unless they pay me 1000 pp. Oh wait, I'm not Fablaar I do have some decent and respect for others. <p><br><br>

I'm in ED and never had a problem with Fablaar, but he is wrong too.... On a secondary thought, do I believe that all of you flamers are pure-hearted EQ goody-goodies who have never KS'ed? Heck no. Some of you are really great people who would never KS purposefully, but I know a few of you have things in your background you only wish everyone would forget. I'm not going to get things stirred up, this has been done enough in the past.<br>
<br>
I'm not flaming or taking up for Fablaar. I simply wish that a FEW(few does not mean all or even most) people would remember that when you point a finger at someone, there are three pointing back at you (try that if you want its kind of funny).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uninafalchon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nINAFALCHON</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/15/02 8:53:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/ninafalchon/vwp?.dir=/My++Pics&.dnm=wired.jpg&.src=ph&.view=l&.done=http%3a//photos.yahoo.com/bc/ninafalchon/lst%3f%26.dir= WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: weee</span><hr size=1> Yes  even us goodie-goodies have KS'd accidentally..... none who have responded to a post with :<br>

Which would you rather be called?  An Oger or a Deakson?<br>

<br>
Besides, posting a random picture of a retarded guy out of the blue and calling him an 'ogre' is a fair bit different from posting a doctored insult pic to someone that uses the same retarded guy. It's a subtle but wide difference.<br>
<br>
And this is Fablaar we're talking about not Deaksun. I am sure I could find an appropriate picture for him if you like. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Leave the goatse.xc or whatever the name is, completely OUT of this thread. Evil evil evil, though I suspect a very good likeness. <br>
<br>
Second: I'd much rather be called an ogrum then a proud KS'er who plays first the &quot;i'm better than you get over it&quot; card, and then the &quot;i was having a bad day&quot; card. <br>
<br>
Bullsh!t, I have bad days all the time, I don't try to make other people miserable for it. That's called &quot;being an a$$hole&quot;. <br>
<br>
If this joker is still tagged with El'lar Dobluth, I'm saddened to see the name soiled in this way. Their members are always of higher quality and character than people who believe that 'might is right' and that ruining someone's day is par for the course. <br>
<br>
If he is no longer with them, then I salute the attention to detail that I've always expected and found with El'lar Dobluth. <br>
<br>
Yours Sincerely,<br>
