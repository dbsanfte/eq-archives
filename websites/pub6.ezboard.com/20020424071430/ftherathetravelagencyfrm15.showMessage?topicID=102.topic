I thought the Rathe community should know that Mealakin, a former member of our guild, ezOP of the Tindi'Losi message board, and a former friend, betrayed the trust placed in him by Tindi'Losi and maliciously deleted our ezBoard yesterday Friday. Gone are hundreds of posts worth of accumulated knowledge, memoirs, pictures and stories documenting the last year of our guild's history on our server. We could have moved our board anytime with a few days work, but did not do so because we trusted him. My advice to anyone dealing with this fellow is: trust Mealakin at your own risk.<br>

now onto reality.<br>
<br>
datalore/merloc + tindi were _caught_, nay, i petitioned about them, exploiting an experience bug in pom which allowed you to gain FAST experience. it was possible to level from 50 to 56 in one or two days using this bug. they were found out about it and mr vaylin was told what was happening. he then took action. now you come here and blame one of your old members for a problem you created. well that's logical.. in some twisted obscure way.<br>
<br>
if you can't live up to your own mistakes datalore, maybe you shouldn't be running a guild. kinda like shei, what a dumb fuck he is.<br>

Does it justify it?  Probably not.  I think Buffalo Springfield said it best when they sang &quot;nobody's right when everybody's wrong.&quot;<br>

In any case, this is a matter between Tindi'Losi and Mealakin, it has no business being here.<br>

I do recall a conversation with a member who made a yellow of 58 in 3 hours, you really can't beat that considering risk vs. reward.<br>

We all knew it would be nerfed. As for the boards deleted, it sucks, but we will just make new ones.<br>
<br>
The person or persons that are responsible for these actions, well, I won't really get into that here.<br>
<br>
As for 'exploiting' this quest. Yes it was a pretty easy quest. Yes it gave a way overpowered xp boost. Yes we did do the quest alot while we were there. Your point? <br>
<br>
Tumpy tonics met all of those criteria, and were in the game for months before Verant decided to change them. Hell, a whole generation of twinks spawned out of Tumpy's. Verant never seemed to say those were an 'exploit'. I don't know of anyone getting banned for doing that quest.<br>
<br>
Either way you look at it, I could really care less. Maybe they will actually test quest rewards before they go to live servers from now on...Haha..yeah right. PoM is a very unfinished zone that Verant keeps putting halfass work into. That xp quest is prolly the best loot that has come out of there for anyone on any server.<br>
<br>
I do like the sound of Tumpy'Losi, Galladel...but it really doesn't fit since we didn't get a full 2 weeks to quest.<br>

Not only did you completely screw Tindi'Losi over by deleting our entire guild history, strategy guides, loot lists, membership lists, creative posts, guild photos, calendars... but you have the absolute gall to try to somehow insinuate that we wronged you.<br>
<br>
We trusted Mealakin with our boards, much as you trust any admin with your electronic data, email, web site, etc... he betrayed our trust.<br>
<br>
The reason, as far as I can tell... he read the guild only message board, then used the information to pester and scold members of Tindi'Losi, who made the enormous leap to assume that he was the person who later petitioned us.  And somehow, this justifies the deletion of our message boards.<br>
<br>
You can call me childish, petty, or any other name you want, but the facts are: I put a lot of work into maintaining the Tindi'Losi message boards, I trusted Mealakin, I personally did nothing to him, and he completely destroyed hundreds of hours of my work.<br>
<br>
Hell yes, I am upset.  If you don't understand why I am, give Mealakin access to your guild message board, and let him do you the &quot;Favor&quot; of completely erradicating it.<br>
<br>
And please do not try to call this a flame, or try to discredit the truth.  This is the first, and hopefully the last post I will have to make on this subject.<br>

The only flames here are coming from the same criminal who deleted our board. Mealakin is using other accounts (Galladel is/was his roommate, plus an anonymous account) to try to defend himself and hide his actions from the light of day.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to add one thing. The anonymous poster referred to &quot;Datalore + Merloc + Tindi&quot;? Interesting choice of names.....the only place Merloc's name was mentioned prior to this anonymous post was on our Tindi Only board when Merloc posted to tell the guild to go up to PoM, including details of how to do the quest. I was the one who deleted Merloc's post from our board about 12 hours afterward and told the guild to look at a new board and ask me for password. Given that Merloc and Datalore are only 2 people out of a leadership team of 12, the anonymous poster who says he petitioned for the quest to be nerfed must have had the ability to read our boards - noone else could have correctly picked those two names out of a hat. Who was that person? Well....let me just say two things about that. One, when Mealakin deleted our boards, the only thing left standing was a new webring link pointing to the Plane of Mischief ezboard...two, if the person who petitioned the quest wasn't Mealakin, why is &quot;TindiExploitsPoM&quot; replying within 12 hours to a thread titled &quot;Mealakin, 53 Cleric&quot; and asking the admins to move this thread to flame central?<br>
<br>

<br>
Now i am not in any way advocating the deletion of your message board, which IMO is out of line, but let me tell you what I have heard on the subject...<br>
<br>
From what I hear, Tindi Losi members were constantly harassing Mealakin online for reading their message board, and petitioning them, something he may or may not have done.<br>
<br>
From what I hear, Mealakin told you a number of times in the last year that he did not want to be in control of your message board... after all, he hasn't been in Tindi for over a year...<br>
<br>
I am not in any way saying that deleting your message board was justified, because to tell the truth it wasn't at all... However, Mealakin (and Galladel) are good friends of mine, who I have known for over a year, and I have heard that the constant harrassement by Tindi Losi members was so aggravating and unrelenting it made the game unplayable; it is understandable he would get fed up with it and look for an easy way to get rid of the problem.   I have nothing against Tindi Losi, but i'm not going to allow my friend's reputation be ruined. This subject should not even have been brought up here. <p><HTML>

He made a thread on our private board and asked everyone to post what custom title they wanted, then used the admin functions to give over a dozen people who responded the titles they wanted, and actively kept the thread clean by deleting posts for people whose titles were done. <br>

He never said or indicated, to my knowledge, that he did not want to our EZop (as if it requires an effort once the board is set up).<br>
<br>
As for our members harrassing him, this is simply not true.  In fact, quite the opposite, it has since come to my attention that Mealakin harrassed Duamil after he read a post regarding an incident that was posted on our Officer board.<br>
<br>
You can put any kind of spin on it you want, Mealakin can lie about it as much as he wants.  If Tindi'Losi members harrassed him, I want names, and instances, not hearsay.  If our members were harrassing him, why didn't he inform the Tindi'Losi leadership?  Why didn't he petition? Our guild was so hell bent on making the game unplayable for him, that we left our message board in his hands, and members let him play their characters on our guild raids.  Give me a break.<br>

Vincecross, you wanted the facts....if you still do, then please: <br>
<br>
1. Move this thread with all the facts we have found so far back to the main board. I am offended that it has been moved here. Noone should be afraid of the truth; moving the thread here amounts to a coverup and denial of justice against the great harm inflicted on Tindi by the person accused of deleting our message board.<br>
<br>
2. Give me a tell in game. I just learnt that Mealakin was angrily abusing a Tindi member for doing the fishing quest in PoM *BEFORE* the first GM showed up there. <br>
<br>
So now we know that an anonymous poster petitioned to have the quest nerfed (see his post above); strangely, this person read a thread titled &quot;Mealakin 53 cleric&quot; within 11 hours of it being posted and felt the need to respond and defend Mealakin (see his post above); the same anonymous poster obviously could read the Tindi boards since he knew which 2 of the 12 leaders to name (see my post); we know that Mealakin could read our boards (he was ezOP); we know that he did read our board while the post was up (logs); we now also know that Mealakin talked to a guild member abusing her for doing the quest BEFORE a GM showed up in PoM (details on request from me in game); and we know that Mealakin deleted our board and left us with a webring link to the Plane of Mischief ezboard (see thread above).<br>
<br>
From talking to Karadin and Vincecross, it seems that Mealakin obviously lied to them by claiming no knowledge of who petitioned for the PoM quest to be nerfed. It should be clear now that any Tindis who sent Mealakin angry tells prior to our board being destroyed were right to do so, and that Mealakin has no shred of an excuse left for deleting our board.<br>

I'm not going to post information on my defense.  Whether people choose to believe what I say or not doesn't matter to me.  I know what events took place and honestly I'm 100% secure knowing what it is I did and did not do.  Make your own assupmtions as to what happened or do not.<br>
<br>
Tindi has been told multiple times that if me being in conrtol and having access to their message boards was a problem to move them.<br>
<br>
Since leaving Tindi people have had a problem with me having access to their boards, yet they did not move.<br>
<br>
During the time in which Tindi was in PoM on that day, multiple Tindi members told me everytime they &quot;dinged&quot;.  Some had in fact gained more than 1 level in the 9 hours I was online.<br>
<br>
I spoke with 2 Tindi members who were my friends (Thundax and Hypathia) during that time.  Thundax told me he wasn't doing the quest, which I then left at that.  Hypathia told me she was at which point I told her I thought I was wrong and was exploiting and didn't want to remain friends with her.<br>
<br>
On logging in the next day I recieve multiple tells from Tindi members harrassing me for a GM showing up.  Multiple people had stated that guild leaders of Tindi were stating that I had asked to go, and upon being refused petitioned GM's in order to get back at them.<br>
<br>
In frustration and wanting to severe all ties with Tindi I went and removed all ties I had with that guild.  1 of those being removing the message board I was in control of.  If being the ezop of a message board auto-matically allows a guild to point fingers at me and use me as an excuse for something that has happened I do not need to be a part of that, nor do I feel I owe them any consideration in the matter, much as the consideration they have shown me.<br>
<br>
I could have been asked if I took part, but no one bothered to do so.  Lies were stated by Tindi which did in fact harm my enjoyment of the game and as a result the guild as a whole suffered.  Was I right to delete the board?  Probably not.  Was it justified?  In my mind yes.<br>
<br>
To those who are in Tindi that did not take part in what was being said about me I apologize.  To those who took part I say you got what you deserved.  For those saying you never did anything to wrong me in any way, I think you should be more truthful in what it is you did do.<br>
<br>
Couple points to consider with this information.<br>
<br>
If I did in fact know all the details of your quest as you suggest I did, and I wanted to go ask your members have told me I asked too then why would I have not posted that information to my guild for them to see.  Am I not in a guild capable of reaching PoM?  I think I am.<br>
<br>
If I also knew all these details, and with the above in consideration, why would I wait so long to to petition a GM over the matter if I was going to do so?  Why would I have contacted members of your guild stating that I did not agree with the legality and honesty of what was being done before petitioning?  Would it not have just been much easier to petition with that information as soon as I recieved it, and never contacted any of your members?<br>
<br>
Seems to me you just took an easy target that you had at hand and used that target to eliviate stress which was caused in your guild.<br>
<br>
In summary, I will not say or even attempt to say that my actions will be justified in the eyes of all who have seen what has happened.  Facts as stand is Tindi`Losi acted on hearsay not facts which lead to the anger of someone who was doing them a favor and as a result terminated that favor.  People will choose to believe what they will, but I am secure in that fact that I will no longer have an association with people in any way who would turn on someone without proof and with out recourse because they had no better outlet in which to use.  Say what you will about me, it doesn't matter.  The people who know me and have known me understand my actions.  And while some of them may not agree with them, they understand.<br>
<br>
This will be the first and only post I make on this subject as to me this was something that occured between a spiteful guild and myself.  I post this for those people who on the Rathe I believe do deserve an explanation since this was made public, but I am not looking for support or damnation.  All the facts listed on both sides are ones mostly unprovable, mostly opinion.  That is what the bottom line is.<br>

He could have given the EZOP to someone else who was willing to do it and didn't. Strait off this was not the thing to do. The collective knowlage of a guild is not something that should just be thrown away.<br>
<br>
My feelings on Tindi's Fishing Quest:<br>
<br>
Hey, were they getting mobs stuck behind walls or anywhere else? No.<br>
Remember the Blessed Ring of Nife quest ? (if you dont it was a quest that took place in Qeynos that gave you a ring (2wis 2ac 1charge greater heal) and almost 1/2 an orange bubble from 1-55 every hour and 13 minutes. Verant removed this and that was that, it was never an exploit, it was just a mistake.<br>

Regardless, I don't think Mealakin just woke up one morning and decided &quot;Hey I'm going to delete there boards because I feel like it&quot;.  Something brought this on.  He was angry, and acted without thinking (Everyone does this) .. so what exactly did Tindi members do or say to him that's not being said?  Perhaps you should talk with Mealakin or your guildmates to find that information out Datalore/Merloc...<br>
<br>
In ending... I really don't know what you expected to solve bringing this to the RTA when the full story is not being told.  Mealakin has always been a nice guy in guildchat, never done anything out of spite, and always there to help.  Regardless, the decision to axe your board was wrong but he just wasn't thinking.  As Slitz said, were all human. <p><p><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left">Lohki Dedematshin<br>Warlord of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=102.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=102.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=102.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=102.topic&start=81&stop=84>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=102.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=102.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=102.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=102.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=102.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=102.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm10">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm22">The Town Newspaper<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencytactics">The Town Tavern<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Adiminstration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Posting Status<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm42">Ragefire<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm28">Post for Changes<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm27">Trakanon<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm29">Cazic Thule<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm30">Sev <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm31">Zland<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm33">Tormax <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm34">Statue <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm36">Klandicar<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm37">Sleeper's Tomb<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm38">Dain<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm39">Yelinak <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm40">Thought Horror OverFiend<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm43">Dozekar<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm44">Avatar of War<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm45">Greig<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Guild access requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15>Flame Central</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://boh.thixo.net">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
