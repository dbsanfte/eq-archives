Ass.&quot;<br>
<br>
You were in VoF for a while, yes.  I'm not sure why or how you were able to control your obviously big temper when with us.  Maybe it was the fact that we gave you a chance, and you appreciated that, I don't know.  You were with us a while, but you also were MIA several times.  You rarely came to many raids until the last few months before you GRed yourself so you could &quot;take a break.&quot;  One thing you always did was try to be Mr. Hero puller.  No matter what it was, if others were taking care of the pull, you would HAVE to run in and help where your help wasn't asked for or needed.  Several times you either just got yourself killed, or ruined the pull for the other pullers.<br>
<br>
You either took a break from the game or didn't, I could honestly care less which.  After that, your toon was involved in some of the worst KSing, camp jumping, and training I've ever seen.  Whether it was you or not hardly matters.  It is your account and you are responsible for who has it.  The fact that you don't chose better friends to trust is not anyone's fault but your own.  After what &quot;Saas&quot; did, there was no WAY you could get back into VoF...hell over half the guild has had you on ignore for months now.  There's no need to flame us on our boards anymore, it will just get deleted again, so please flame us here if you must.<br>
<br>
I normally would just ignore this as I hate flames, but I need to call foul when you start comparing your actions in and out of VoF with Wollverine's.  You were a nice person in VoF, and maybe even a good member, but Wollv has put twice as much into the guild in his short time than you ever did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mythranor>Mythranor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/24/03 4:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: And the worst flamer award goes to.....</span><hr size=1> Could someone please translate what Saas is saying?
