<br>
There are a couple of suggestions that I would like to pose,<br>
<br>
First, if we don't have the people needed for the event on time (90 mins after the event is supposed to begin for ex.) we should call off the event. It is very flustrating for everyone to wait for hours...many hours for other people to show up.<br>
<br>
Second, if we have 35-50 people for the raid it doesn't mean that we are going to kill these dragons. It is better to have 5 tanks above 45 than 10 tanks between 40-41 the same thing happens with the healers, 2 lvl 49 clerics are equal to 5 druids regardless their level (no offense to druids, but for years now clerics are supposed to be the primary healers). <br>
<br>
We should not even think to start a dragon raid if we don't have the sufficient amount of clerics/casters and tanks. Don't go for the quantity but the quality...the quality is 10 times better than the quantity everyone knows that.<br>
<br>
The MUST in dragons raids are (IMHO):<br>
-Monk for puller, don't even think that there are better pullers than monks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
-Many Clerics! Otherwise tanks are dead -&gt; Casters are dead -&gt; Vox/Naggy won again.<br>
-BARDS &lt;----We need you where are you! Your songs are more than great, they keep tanks alive for a VERY long time.<br>
-High MR/MC/MF before you even get buffed, believe me with 98 in MC I stayed alive for a long long time. Everyone can spend 300-500pp, you are not going to regret this since you might be able to see one of these dragons dead and you alive <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
-Enchanters, especially in Vox, they drain all her mana and she cannot cast CH.<br>
-Warriors, I might be a Paladin but Warriors are THE tanks.<br>
-Shamans, STR/DEX/AGI are not junk buffs! And Talisman can boost tanks HP over the limit.<br>
-Lvl limit? Well the higher the better. Hehe, if we had 35 ppl between 47-52 that would be more than great! (dreamer!)<br>
<br>
If we don't have the above in sufficient numbers better not to try to &quot;kill&quot; any of these two dragons. <br>
<br>

The last Naggy raid, I pegged the day (even though we didn't have a patch).  Do you think all those who signed up showed up?  No.<br>
<br>
The only way you are going to get these numbers is to create a list of classes with specific numbers of those classes you want on the raid.  For example, if you want 6 full groups, you might say...<br>
<br>
5 Clerics<br>
4+ Wizards<br>
2+ Shamans<br>
2+ Enchanters<br>
4+ Warriors<br>
3+ Bards<br>
2+ Monks<br>
1+ Magicians<br>
1+ Necromancers<br>
<br>
and so on.  You then create the sign up and say you are only going to take so many of those from the classes setup.  Any excess will be held in reserves for no-shows, but is *not* guaranteed a spot on the raid.  Those in reserve would roll over to the next raid.  It's hard telling those who don't fit in this matrix they aren't coming/can't come.<br>
<br>
These are my ideas on what I would like to have for a dragon raid.  I don't think I've ever led a raid where it happened, but I could be wrong.  As in all things, YMMV. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uflarrenlagdalen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flarren Lagdalen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(11/7/00 1:01:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I wish</span><hr size=1> actually..reducing the amout of people and making them sign up to go, not just showing up, might make people work more for the kill. I've only been on a couple raids and I'm not high enough for planes yet but the biggest complaint I hear is people who dont do what they're told. Eg, people who break a mez, wander out too far and pull a train, dont run in the room when told...etc. I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about. I know you wanna make it fair to everyone that wants to go but can there not be some type of &quot;punishment&quot; for killing your own group multiple times? or blatantly ignoring the function leader? maybe tell them they cant go on the next raid and if they understand why they are exempted they can try again at the next raid.<br>
<br>
Maybe it would work maybe it wouldn't but people would stop being stupid and listen to the commanders if they were told &quot;no you cant go cause you refused to listen last time&quot; <br>
<br>
I'm a bit of an extremist sometimes but if we wanna kill these things this might be a valid suggestion that no one else wants to put foreward...<br>

Whether it be opening doors that they shouldn't or pulling when they shouldn't or whatever it is. The higher level the targets, the more important group and personal discipline is. <br>
<br>
I wouldn't want to go so far as to say the Council should punish people by banning them from ANY CoG raids in the future, because the CoG isn't and shouldn't try to be a legislative body. But kicking them from the group they are in can and should be done when discipline is being broken by someone. If a buffer doesn't want to buff, good bye, you're no good to the raid. If a warrior doesn't want to camp out after buffing because he is bored, &quot;See ya&quot; you can try to come to the next raid. <br>
<br>
There is no reason to allow someone who will not discipline themselves to continue on the current raid. The big problem is doing it, because no one wants to be the bad guy. :-)<br>

Each time we do these raids is like doing the raid for the first time for the majority of members present.  <br>
<br>
I have had tanks tell me they never gor healed, and I watched them stand and fight to their death beside me.  I got healed 3 times in that one.  They seemed to think that they would be healed just like they are healed in a single group, they don't step out and move to triage for a heal.  The heal does not come to you you come to the heal.<br>
<br>
Resists<br>
Last dragon raid while sitting in the chat room waiting for the buffs to get done a person told me their resists were 59 for cold and not certain about magic before buffs.  This is way too low for this type of encounter.  Those that do not meet minimim resists should be told to buy resist jewellry right now if available or to come back for the next one suitably  prepared.  I have heard that 75 for heat/cold and magic is a suitable minimum, with heat/cold being the most important.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uflarrenlagdalen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flarren Lagdalen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(11/8/00 5:25:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Policies</span><hr size=1> I think I explained it wrong, went back and read it and realized I worded kinda wrong. what I meant was after they had been warned and all, make the person non priority for only the 1 next event. after that they'd be welcome back to try again. I'd be mortified if I got booted permanently over a mistake or misunderstanding. it would have to be a repeated problem that would cause it but it would be a temporary warning, nothing permanent (unless ofcourse they do it every single time).<br>
another possible and good idea which was given to me by Raval was maybe leaving them out of a loot order turn for diciplinary action. maybe only 1 round just to say &quot;smarten up and listen&quot;. Once again only as a temporary thing. Next time they might think more about what they're doing.<br>

<br>
1.) Resist. These play a huge part in the raid in that they enable you to stay in battle longer. <br>
<br>
2.) Enchanters(vox mainly) You should have at least 4 chanters with mana drain.(that is the key to killing her)<br>
<br>
3.) High level tanks. You need as many 48-52 tanks as possible. I would say 10 or so tanks at this level.<br>
<br>
4.) Casters. BOMBS AWAY! Stack up as many as you can on the casters. They should be the majority aginst vox. Time vox is alive is key.I would say about 15 or so casters<br>
<br>
5.) Clerics. Not as big of a part as you may think. But you can kill her with a limeted amount of clerics. I would say 2-5 clerics would be plenty<br>
<br>
6.) Bards. Put the bards in with the tanks for the resist songs... In the long run it keeps the tanks in there longer allowing the casters to live. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would say 4-6 bards would be sufficent.<br>
<br>
7.) Damage Dealers.(Rogues,Monks) Both rogues and monks should take thier place behind the dragons. 3-5 should be enough. (of each hehe)<br>
<br>
I know getting that mix of people together at one time is har to do. But, with this mix the ragons shoul be a snap.<br>

<br>
I think what might be helpful though is if there is a fairly consistent, experienced management body. As Shadusanator is leading these things now, I'd like him to start reserving a few spots, say 6 or so, for those he feels would be helpful in organizing the raid. This management body could provide the consistent organization to pull these off successfully with regularity. <br>
<br>
However, many of the single guild and multi-guild alliances are now having trouble taking down both dragons (although Vox is harder than Naggie), simply because those experienced in doing the raids move beyond the level at which they can do the raids. <br>

Also, they can help much for killing Fire Giants by using Charm. For the battle vs Naggy, even a Level 52 Enchanter still CAN ONLY do few to none raw damage as all their spells are Magic-Based and we all know the big target has ultra high magic resist.
