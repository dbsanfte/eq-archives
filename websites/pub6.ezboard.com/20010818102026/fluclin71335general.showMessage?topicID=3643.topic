<br>
A <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> great leader has a firm direction and solid goals for the guild.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  These goals can range from keeping a family atmosphere to killing the Sleeper (with a little determination LOL).  For the guild leader and all it's members, the goals/direction of the guild must be &quot;fun&quot;. Afterall, we all play EQ for fun.  If the goals and direction aren't clear, members end up doing their own thing.  <br>
<br>
Another thing a great leader does is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> he or she only recruits people that have the same goals as the guild as a whole.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  A lot of guild have trouble here.  They start off with a clear focus, but end up with people that aren't aligned with the focus of the guild.  This leads excessive turnover, people doing their own thing, and people with incorrect expectations of the guild.<br>
<br>
What makes a great guild is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> its own ability to achieve its own goals -- whatever those goals are.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If a guild loses it's family atmosphere that it wanted to maintain, it's not a great guild.  If a guild has goals of killing uber MOBs, but never gets the right levels, classes, and gear together, it's not a great guild.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion...  That will be 2cp please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Zaboo "BIG BOO" Krusher<BR>

<br>
All in all, to make a GREAT guild you need the following:<br>
 - coherent members<br>
 - members who want to know what they can do for the guild, not what the guild can do for them<br>
 - members who group together on every occasion<br>
 - members who are willing to work together to help people other than themselves when needed<br>
<br>
To make a great guild leader:<br>
 - must be willing to research the game<br>
 - must go out of way to help members<br>
 - must lead by example<br>
 - must be selfless<br>
 - must ensure guild moral stays up through planning raids and recognizing efforts of members<br>
 - must be willing to deal with member's actions and take responsibility for them<br>
<br>
<br>
That's about the best that I can come up with right now...  <p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000000">

The tough part is the balance between the focus of the guild vs. the desires of individual members. There are a great many directions a guild can go. There are many members with their own agendas. It is tough to make everyone feel like their needs will be attended to while trying to do even the simplest of tasks. Some toes will be and need to be stepped on. You can't please everyone but I think with a good focus and active membership most will reap the rewards of their hard work (and the guild's hardwork), whether it's what they desired originally or not.<br>

A great guild leader is one that utilizes all her assets.  This individual will gather her officers and assign duties to reduce the load on her.  <br>
<br>
Officers of the guild. Her officers will inform and support the leader rather than take over.  They work out differences behind closed doors and provide a united front to the guild as a whole.  <br>

The whole unit works together to meet goals and allows indivduals to find their niche in the organization.<br>

Okay, three things, but they were all the same.  Nothing will destroy a guild's morale faster than having the morale of the guild leader degrade to nothing, and EQ can turn into a job very quickly for somebody who has to run a guild.  My minimum EQ session used to be 2 hours just because that's how long it would take to get through all the tells I received after I had logged on.  I have gained the uncanny ability to maintain about 6 simultaneous conversations, but at a heavy price.  I came to the realization that I wasn't getting a paycheck for this stupid game, so I had to stop treating it like full time employment.  Raventod had the same problem before we merged with the Steel Gladiators, and we had lengthy discussions about it; he co-leads with me now, but even the two of us wouldn't be enough to herd this gaggle of freaks (I mean that in a good way, honest... FREAKS!).<br>
<br>
Now we have committees for grievances, membership, and loot, and those people have complete authority in their respective fields.  Giving up that authority isn't easy, but you have to be prepared to do it.  I can actually group again, and have some catching up to do since some members passed me, but I'm smiling and things are running very smoothly.  You don't necessarily need committees, and you don't need to be all that complicated, but you need to appoint officers for duties and trust them completely in those duties.  If you do it while your guild is young, you won't experience nearly the growing pains you would otherwise should you gain many new members in a short amount of time.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is that whatever your goals either as a guild, or as a leader, structure is important, but not the type of structure one would imagine.  You don't need &quot;houses&quot; or &quot;dynasties&quot;, or class leaders, or anything like that -- those are a neat option, but the kind of structure I mean is just having your officers know their roles and trusting those officers.  If you can get all the mundane guild tasks running on auto-pilot through such structure and delegation, you can work on more important matters, not the least of which is reputation.  No matter what your guild is like internally, make damn sure it's respected externally or you will get nowhere. <p><hr align="center" size="1" COLOR="#006600">

I can't add to much to what makes a great guild leader... I myself am honestly not sure what I think a great guild leader is, even though I try my best each day to improve something.<br>
<br>
As for a great guild... I agree.  Focus, organization, and some internal structure to alleviate stress off the guild leader(s) is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> very</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> important.   I think AE is all I could ever ask for because of these things, and because my members -- my guildmates -- are all very willing to abide by our charter and stick with our goals.  No matter how finicky I am on raid rules or organization, they stick by me and we accomplish our goals with very few hitches.<br>
<br>
I guess I'd just like to throw in that I'm very proud of everyone who has stood by the guild for this long and I owe them a lot of thanks for not driving me completely insane...

He needs to know what he wants his guild to be and where he wants it to go, and make sure that the members in his guild fit into his scheme accordingly. However, a guild leader needs to be realisitic. He needs to know what his guild can realistically handle  and plan accordingly. i.e. no scheduling a raid for ST four months later after you clear fear for the first time or something... So he needs to know his guilds strengths. <br>
<br>
What makes a guild solid though? People need to be willing to evolve. Things aren't going to stay the same forever and people need to roll with the flow a little bit (in my opinion) in order to keep a guild healthy as strong, as well as keeping it from growing too stale. Sometimes people can be afraid of change, but you gotta embrace it in order to advance the guild sometimes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usierradane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sierradane</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.bellsnwhistles.com/asta/ast014.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadowed Man</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/01 4:41:43 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sierradane.homestead.com/files/Zverytod.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Discussion - Seeking ALL opinions</span><hr size=1> *looks up amid the papers piling up on her EQ desk, her hair falling in her eyes... *<br>

You get to group?  You get to play the game?  <br>
<br>
My officers are a group of people that have surrounded me and view me as their Queen.  *blushes*  One of them handles the PR part, another the loot, another looks for possible recruits and still yet another handles the PNM and Probies boards.  I'm not a dictator, but I have been known to veto their ideas and set my foot down.  The officers are very protective of me, and sometimes they leave me up on my pedistal for too long and won't let me down.<br>
<br>
My Class Leaders are very much the same, in that they are there to answer questions from their class, and to be their mentor.<br>
<br>
My members all pretty much love me, and for the most part are a good lot to be with.  With the exception of one particular bubble bath bandit who forever is stealing my peach scented bubble bath for her leezard friend.  *hugs Lisa*<br>
<br>
It takes structure, rules, committees and is really like running a business.  And it also helps to be able to talk "guild leader talk" with other guild leaders in the game. <p>I don't say I'm no better than anybody else...<br>
but I'll be danged if I ain't just as good!<br>(from the Broadway Play, Oklahoma!)<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/veterans_legion">Veterans Legion</a><br><img src="http://sierradane.homestead.com/files/guildtag.jpg"><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umantroseq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MantrosEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Will O Wisp</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/2/01 4:41:50 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/Mantros/PICS/KNIGHT.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Discussion - Seeking ALL opinions</span><hr size=1> Thank you all for your feedback.<br>
<br>
This was excellent for me to read, a reminder if you will, of what truly great guilds are about.<br>
<br>
As I grow my new guild, I hope to put your advice to good use.  Tonight will be our first guild meeting, and I have taken some notes from this to bring with me.<br>
<br>
Everyone will have a slightly different perspective on what makes a guild great.  So, I read each post carefully, and looked for common beleifs.  And, there were many.<br>
