<br>
As you can see there were several story changes. What I want to know is why ANY<br>
self-respecting guild would go up to a plane that's ALREADY SCHEDULED. This<br>
group KNEW about the RTA (notice 1 Norrath Travel Bureau and 1 Grave Wisdom),<br>
KNEW they weren't supposed to be up there yet went anyway. We've scheduled Fear<br>
before and on 3 different occasions have gone up and found the plane ganked. Now<br>
we have a better idea of who's responsible and so does the rest of the Rathe<br>
community.<br>

  Seems a little dicey on the logs.  This could very well be a group who went in last week (so, corpses would be okay) on a FFA day like Monday or Tuesday for XP and drops and wiped.  <br>
<br>
  Your statements that he admitted things are unfounded.  He never said he was in there on the 30th (today) just that he had wiped.   <br>

It's an excellent zone, visually that is, and remains my favorite of them all, just for the... atmosphere, I guess. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I suspect that a group of 6 level 50-60ish wouldn't have the ability to clear the good stuff from fear (read: Golems and up). I'm not supporting going into any plane on a reserved day; quite the opposite. I think people need to respect the calandar, or at least respect it until such time that fear is so worthless that people FFA it and no one cares. Anyway, as I was saying though, I don't think that there should be a drawing and quartering of individual guilds in this case... there doesn't seem to be guild participation to an extent that warrents guild punishment. Yes, the guilds in question should, as a whole, know better than to enter a reserved plane. But the actions of one individual who was, in all accounts, picked up in an LFG situation, doesn't strike me as something that warrents a guild-level punishment. Case in point: If one member of a guild uses an exploit, I can't see the fair result being a 7 day suspension of all the members. Yes yes, apples and oranges in terms of situation, but the sentiment remains. <br>
<br>
A guild cannot be defined solely by the actions of just one member. Before anyone castrates me for that sentiment, mind you, lets understand that I don't mean that you cannot form opinions of the kinds of people that guilds allow entry; I also don't mean that a guild that has members in it that frequently violate reservations should not be subject to questions of adhereance to Rathe agreements. What I am saying, however, is that in this situation; arguably an abberation on the part of the guilds represented by their sole members; that the normal 30 day suspention of guilds involved is punitive, and not restorative. <br>
<br>
Thats my .02 though...<br>
<br>
PS: In case I have to say it, that's my .02 as an uninvolved party, and by no means is the official word from &quot;the RTA&quot;.<br>
<br>
You'll excuse me if it sounded that way.<br>

LoL)<br>
<br>
Just want to point out because someone is guilded by any guild that uses the RTA system, that in no way confers omnipotence that they know this website and it's system exists.<br>
<br>
I've been a member of Norrath Travel Bureau since at least 1998, I've been an officer for at least 2 years now and did not know anything about this board until the last maybe...6 months, and I surf the net a fair bit.<br>
<br>
Simply using the excuse that someone carries a tag makes them aware of RTA reservations is ludicrous. I'm sure had I never been introduced to this board/system I would have likely at somepoint scheduled/attended a raid for one of those planes, and been abruptly introduced to it (the RTA system that is).<br>
<br>
How can you intend to fault the people at hand with no solid evidence. I'm sure to indite NTB as the offender (or Grave Wisdom) then you surely have the name of the toon involved to back yourself up that personal knowledge said person has an awareness of this board/system at all.<br>
<br>
If you do have the member's name for the &quot;Norrath Travel&quot; tag (I seem to remember a few guilds around, not just &quot;Bureau&quot; to finish that (Agency and Acadamy come to mind, neither of which had relations with us to my knowledge))... I will certainly see they are properly educated upon proper RTA Ettiquette for the future. <br>
<br>
HOWEVER, as I understand it, for the record as it states in many places here, it's an agreement amongst these guilds, not something enforced by SONY. But I'm sure I won't need to remind another RTA Guilded member of such polocies....<br>
<br>
Changing of leadership etc can certainly not pass the information down the chain if we're caught unaware. I certainly don't see this website advertised in a lot of places and actually had a fairly hard time finding it, even asking in the Trade channel when I first learned about it. So you can see it's even rarely discussed in game, that is, unless something goes wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
So, if you have the member's name of NTB - I'll certainly validate said players knowledge of this board or not. I cannot do the same for GW as I am not a member.<br>

To not do so puts the whole guild at risk, as sanctions can be imposed on guilds who break the rules.

In NTB's case, this would affect the entire alliance.<br>

But as a member of that leadership, it was not brought to *my* knowledge that we were such a thing...such things had never been explained to me. I just knew the dates for the raids and showed up. <br>
<br>
However, after a change in leadership there is no such guaruntee that previous leaders, of any guild, bear such responsibility to further educate their members, if they even remain members...(splitting hairs, but I was made an officer, then co-leader and for most of that time(as detailed above) I knew nothing about this system or this board). I don't hold any leadership or player responsible personally - I'm just trying to find out so that everyone can be educated, since indeed we are a 'registered guild'.<br>
<br>
Even if it did happened by our own fault, NTB would take such a responsibility with the &quot;punishment&quot;. <br>
<br>
However within the log itself it changed from NT... to NACo, to NTB...which was it? <br>
<br>
And who was it is what I'd like to know....more to the fact they can be properly educated. I'll try and find people ingame..<br>

<br>
Are you mad that I'm not giving things away, or perhaps you're angry that my prices are more than 1/3 what they ever would be in EC, because everyone uses the bazaar now? Every merchant feels that crunch.<br>
<br>
As for next cheze, nah, I'm just not that dedicated anymore.<br>
<br>
But then, this is a flame board and most prices are never much better, so really, who are you to judge?<br>
<br>
As for buying from me? I've never been afraid of refunds, you never said anything to me about it personally so I'll take your comment at face value, thanks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I think my more famous rants is the amount of /petitions I'd get, just on sheer volume of merchandise...most people had no idea that spam was the same thing over and over again, not 5, 7, 12 full lines of items. My final EC record was 93.<br>
<br>
As for dr00d...I don't think I've been one of those since I found the glory of EC...well...tinkle of plat, gold and long tedious days with lists upon lists, now the bazaar speeds it up so much (buying and selling).<br>
<br>
Besides, anyone with half a brain can really buy/sell.<br>
<br>
But you really need an ounce of patience hehe...(sorry Cheze, the secret is out, figured we don't need it anymore, we have the glory of typos within the bazaar now)<br>
<br>
Wow, sorry off topic there, must be the harem distracting me to get back ingame <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That or the Bracer of Sense that I just scored for 1400pp.<br>

The initial application is a little out of date, as Astryne and Lharia haven't been members for almost a year now. As far as I recall Tempeste hasn't been leader for close to or at least that long as well.<br>
<br>
There's an upcoming meeting, I'll be sure updated information is provided and that the rules are gone over so that members are aware of their existance, and understand them, thanks again!<br>
