He lost  alot of his good cops, some that i known since i was born and use to take for rides in the police car as  a baby .  Alot of   good people died. Too many   to be exact as  i looked at the paper this morning and on front page is a full page of people who died i think it was around 3000 people.. There was times where i didnt get to see my dad for  months at a time, but he did have alot of stories to tell.. but  he  sais the only thing that   ever bothered him during this, was the sound of people hitting the ground who jumped out, he said there is     nothing  like that sound and its a sound you wish you would never     hear...<br>
<br>
I send my  condolences to those who lost<br>

I awoke that morning with my car packed all set to begin a 3 day journey across country to visit my sweetie Draclorath for a month vacation. My son came over from next door crying telling me to turn on the tv and when i did i saw the 2nd plane hit , i sat with my son in horror and shock crying till he had to go to school.<br>
  I then braced myself and got in my car to begin the long journey from texas to virginia, and the entire day was just surreal, cars pulled over to the sides of the roads total strangers holding eachother and crying, each stop i made along the road from gas stations to food stops i cryed and talked with total strangers, hugged children etc. Each night i stopped i cryed and called folks when i could get thru to them on my cell phone as i watched the news unfold. <br>
  Needless to say those 3 days will forever be burned into my mind. I cry again today watching the coverage and will probably cry off and on today as we as a nation come together and remember and mourn those that were lost, and remember the fallen heros who desperatly tryed to save others.<br>
  Around the world people will mourn and remember those lost, and remember those other nations that came to our aide during this terrible tragedy. And yet again remember that its NOT over by a long shot.<br>

She is a great friend to anyone she meets and I consider one of the closest friends I have ever met in game and out...........<br>
<br>
Time heals all wounds, or so they say. <br>
When we look back and think of that day, <br>
But the scars that remain, you can not see, <br>
They remain a part of you and me. <br>
<br>
The Twin Towers strong and proud, <br>
tumbled that day admidst the crowd. <br>
We cried aloud as we watched them fall. <br>
The lives lost touched us all. <br>
<br>
A year has past, as we look to the sky. <br>
A year gone, we still wonder why. <br>
Our lives have changed, nolonger carefree. <br>
The cost we pay for tragedy. <br>
<br>
So to the people we have lost; I dedicate to you. <br>
The grace of God, to see your families through. <br>

This was posted on our guilds webboard but I felt it needed to be placed here for everyone to see. I know today has been a day of rememberence for us all. Im going to cut and paste what I added on our guild webpage as well......<br>
<br>
I really dont know what to say about this anymore. 9-11 is the day that I will never forget in my life. I have never been one to express feelings. I usually hold it all in and deal with it in my own way. But today is just a day I have been broke down all day. All those people lost in one day. Ya know I look back on that day and all I really want to do is just lock myself in the house and do nothing. There are some really phucked up people in this world, I was just told as Im typeing this that not more then a mile from me a Walgreens had an Anthrax scare. I mean WTF, do these people have nothing better to do then thrive off the pain and misery of others? After 9-11-01 I have never been more happier to be an American all my life and it woke me up. Too many people take the things we have for granted and dont realize how lucky we have it. Nina hun I sit here and I read your poem with a tear in my eye right now. For those of us that are Americans just take a minute out of today and realize what you have. Go hug your mother or father. Pull them tight and dont let them go. Today is a day we should all be happy we are sitting here being able to do this.........For those of you that lost people on 9-11-01 I am sorry and pray for each that overtime your pain will go. Hug someone that you love and hold close to you. Be safe guys and let today be one that you take that extra step to help or hug or make someone you love feel even closer..........<br>

I went to sleep and slept all day , not aware of what was occuring.  When I awoke that evening , I was informed of what happened , and was shocked.  Although the events of 9-11 were very tragic and is something that I agree should never have happened . For me the events that occurred on 9-11 , were no where near the most shocking for me that occurred that week. <br>
<br>
For me , the most tragic thing that occurred that week , was in the aftermath of things .<br>
<br>
Talking with my co workers and associates , how many of them , were taking such a passive stance in all that had happened , and stated that we deserved what happened .  <br>
People living here in the USA , living under the freedoms and rights that were fought for so long ago ,and using those freedoms to state their opinion while claiming their  freedom and rights(the same freedom and rights that those that perished in 9-11 died for) to do exactly that, which to me makes them no better than those that commited the act that was done. <br>
<br>
<br>
Being force fed news day in and day out about it( personally I hate and abhor News . It is generally negative , and it is HEAVILY BIASED , not to mention that I trust reporters about as much as I trust an Honest Lawyer), and seeing reports right and left , dis crediting our government , and feeding the terrorists right and left with golden spoons , giving them everything that they were hoping for. <br>
<br>
And then lastly months down the line , to see the government becoming once again passive in the way that things are done , so that it may all happen again. <br>
<br>
Its high time that the USA began to look out for the USA , and let the rest of the world deal with itself .  <br>
<br>
We have spent so much time dealing with the rest of the worlds problems , and the worlds security and safety , that we failed to see a hole in our own security and safety , as it was taken for granted. <br>
<br>
Did we deserve what we got ? The answer to that is NO . No country , Nation , or person ever deserves what happened. <br>
<br>
Could we have done something to prevent it? Yes , absolutley without a doubt. <br>
<br>
What I will remember about 9-11 , is the needless loss of life tha occurred, because we as a nation were to concerned with what was going on with the rest of the world thousands of miles away , instead of being concerned with what was in our own back yard.  And the &quot;waking of the Sleeping Giant&quot; , to take care of these terrorists , only to have it lulled back to sleep, so that it may be suprised again .   That is the true tragedy here. <br>
<br>
And that is what will be remembered most. <br>
<br>
I pray for the day when our leaders finally see the light , and decide that its time to do something . <br>
<br>
And I pray that the events of 9-11 will never be repeated, and  that God (regardless of religion) will Intervene, cause if he doesn't . Other events such as 9-11 are around the corner , and there is nothing that will stop them .... <br>

<br>
Hmmm... 9-11-01.  I had woken up for work around 9:20am PST, showered &amp; rushed out the door.  Got to work and my co-workers were talking about what happened and I started watching the clips, listening to the radio and reading all I could about what happened.<br>
<br>
I was in shock.  Could not fathom what was happening and happened.  We didn't have a TV that day, just radio and internet to keep up.  I normally don't watch much news because like I read earlier I think they are exceedingly biased &amp; causing half of the problems by getting all the bad/nasty stuff out to everyone in seconds which just gives more unstable people ideas of what to do.<br>
<br>
I watched the news and read all I could for the next few days and made sure our flag was out every morning at half mast for the duration.  I remember about a week later going to a candlelight vigil at a local park and seeing all the different people gathered to pay tribute.  It was moving.<br>
<br>
I read the thoughts and memories now and my heart is still wrenched at the thought of all who died and the anger that was kindled that day flames anew.  I keep thinking of Tom Clancy's novel Ranbow Six and how an orginization like that to take down the bastards that did this and all the others like them that would kill innocent people without regard just because they think differently.  Fanaticism is NOT a good thing.<br>
<br>
I don't know what else to say and will end this with one more thought.  I heard about this site on the radio yesterday and thought I would share for people that might be interested.<br>
