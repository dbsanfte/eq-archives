She was saying AT LEAST 1000 people were following the calander by taking the bare minimum of the players needed to go.  Math isn't your strong suit is it?<br>

&quot;You see you keep saying even though I don't agree with the calender I should abide by it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bull #$# everyone has told you you don't HAVE to follow it, but that would entail you actualy reading the posts wouldn't it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Why? I don't agree with it so there is no agreement between myself and the calender people so there is no reason for me to follow your rules.&quot;<br>

 Massive-Multi-Online-Roleplaying-Game.<br>
<br>
 This is what you bought when you purchased Everquest.<br>
 <br>
 When you installed Everquest, you entered an Online Environment. This environment has PEOPLE in it that you enter to Play with.<br>
 Like any building in real life, if you put too many PEOPLE into 1 room, you get an overcrowded room.<br>
 If you put too many people into one zone, what happens to that zone? it crashes. It lags down really hard.<br>
 What happens when 2 people fight over 1 item? They have an arguement.<br>
 What happens when 50 people fight over 1 item against another 50 or so? They have a huge arguement.<br>
<br>
 With multiple thousands of people playing 1 game and all wanting 1 zone, what do you have? a clusterfuq. You want your time in the planes, just like everyone else does.<br>
 The calendar is a way to organize that, it gives a place to post your intents so everyone knows you'll be going to this spot at this time. This prevents confusion, and people respect your right for you to enter the zone and do what you will with it, without having to argue, fight, /petition or report cause someone else also has that same right to enter the zone whenever you're there.<br>
<br>
 Do you get upset when someone else also has the same plans to camp the same thing you do? Do you get upset when someone walks into a room and says, &quot; excuse me, step aside, i'm camping this also. No, i really dont care if you've made these plans, i made the same plans you did. &quot;<br>
<br>
 With the number of people on this server, the number 40 was the lowest that was agreed to by large, small, and medium 'sized' guilds alike. If you had followed these discussions from the beginning or close there of, you'd have seen this. If you read all the posts from everyone that has come here, you'd have seen that.<br>
<br>
 Do me a favor, all of these people that you claim dont agree with the calendar because they've been &quot; told &quot; they cannot enter the planes or they will be punished, list them out. i'd like to take a few minutes of my personal time to talk with them, in game, in an adult like manner. If they arent able to go to the planes due to their specific level, i dont expect them to even comprehend the planes at all. It's not exactly lower guk.<br>
 If you're pushing for FFA, then umm, dont expect anyone to give you the time of day to bother with you when they run past and get what it is they want, which incidentally, is the same thing you want.<br>
<br>
 If you dont abide by the calendar, fine. Choose your own path, everyone else on the server that goes to the planes by the calendar will continue to respect the other people they play this game with, help fine tune the calendar to make it better.<br>
 Whenever you enter the planes and start killing someone elses plane raid, they're gonna get upset, and the rest of the server will undoubtedly know about it soon after. What happens when these people's friends find out you werent respecting their friends?<br>
 Ya know, i dont expect you to list out all these people that yall have said dont abide by the calendar. Why? because i dont see 40 of them being plane capable, nor understanding what the calendar is, or what the server population of planeable characters are. <p><table width="50%" border="0">

<br>
When I go to camp something and someone else is camping it I move on until either they are done or they log.  Then I go camp it.  I do not push people out.  I do not expect anyone to claim any zone or any spawn as theirs.  I know what the game is and I also know the rules of the game.  Although the calender people do not seem to.  I have every right to zone into the planes and hunt.  I do not HAVE to sign up on your calender.  <br>
<br>
Someone tried to tell you they were going to the planes on the 4th.  Instead of just giving him a day people started slamming him.  At least he told you he was going.<br>
<br>
The fights are not caused by me or anyone else that doesn't agree with the calender.  They are caused by posting entities and big brother (uber) guilds who think they own the planes.  The problem is that no posting entity wants to be told that you have the right to go to the planes and hunt. And yes I was in Fear and I did hunt there with some friends for a while.  It is really no big deal.<br>
<br>
But for someone like taliesan to log on and start throwing major threats then they are looking at having their toon or their account deleted.<br>

You obviously dont care about playing ' with' others on an overcrowded server, you just want whats yours.<br>
 &quot;a lot of people have been listing here about not liking the calender. However, they have been flamed, ignored, harassed, etc. Then the people of the calender claim no foul. &quot;<br>
-- In previous posts i've seen from the people that have gotten flamed cause they dont agree with the calendar, Personally i'd have told all of them to fuq off in real life for how they were saying things.<br>
 You get what you give.<br>
<br>
 Those that do work with others dont flame the calendar even if they dont agree with it, but they offer solutions and compromise to fix what they see as wrong, and not &quot; if you dont change this to how i see fit, i'm starting FFA! &quot;.<br>
 Let me clue you in, it's not about how hard the planes are anymore, it's about working the the people YOU play with when you log in getting their fair share too.<br>
 I'm not gonna bother repeating myself anymore with you jahaha or whatever your name is. I've explained over and over in previous posts in the past 3 months. If you give a fuq about what you're bitching about, i'd suggest you go read it with an open mind. Hell, just go READ it to understand it would be plenty.<br>
<br>
Edit: this guy that threatened you doesnt have anything to do with the calendar. You say this like you think the calendar is some &quot;massive organization&quot; that sent him out to get you or something.<br>
 Personally, i dont care if someone threatened you whether it's right or wrong. You dont seem to give a fuq about the people around you, why should they care about you? <p><table width="50%" border="0">

You have NO RIGHT according to Verant (in case you missed it they made and control the game) as to where anyone goes or when.  I do not care about uber equipment nor mega loot.  I like to hunt in new and fun places. <br>
<br>
If you can't handle that then take your swearing tail and ........fill in the blank.  I am tired of you telling me I don't read.  I have read the calender rules more than once and STILL do not agree.  That doesn't make me a bad person just an individual with a brain and mind of my own.  Sorry you do not share in these skills.  Maybe someday when your all grown up you will.<br>

Hmm, we've had jamany, clept, Zanthor, and a couple of Zanthor's guildmates.  Which seems to be able 5 to me.  How is this a &quot;lot&quot;?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> However, they have been flamed, ignored, harassed, etc. Then the people of the calender claim no foul.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you post a flame, expect a flame back.  When posts are made in reasonable, well thought out ideas, we listen.  We may not agree, but we will listen.  But as I've stated before, we obviously have a different definition of a flame.<br>
<br>

<br>
This seems to be condradictory to me.  If they do not &quot;own&quot; the spawn, then why not just go in and make them give it to you?  After all it does not belong to them, so you are not actually taking it from them.<br>
<br>
Maybe the truth is that people in this game, do consider spawns to be &quot;owned&quot; by other players.  <br>

Well, I'm pretty sure I know the rules of the game.  Even those that I don't nessicaly agree with.<br>
<br>
But maybe I'm not a &quot;calender person&quot;.  I'm not an Admin, I don't even post for my guild here.  I just like to keep up with whats going on on ther server that I play on.<br>

Hmm, sure.  Not sure I agree with your use of the word &quot;right&quot; here, at least if you are speaking about Verant's stance.  From what I have read of thier posts players do not have the right to hunt anywhere.<br>

Agreed, you do not have to.<br>

<br>
So we should give everyone a day that asks for it, with no restrictions?  So if everyone in my guild came here and requested the next 30 days in a row, everyone else on the calendat should just give us those days?<br>
<br>
I think not.  This is why there are rules as to who can post on the calendar.<br>

Hehe, ask the people that were trying to break in yesterday how big a deal they think it is?  I think they were doing CR for a few hours before NH/SB decided to do a break in.  Not sure how it ended up for them, I only caught a bit of it in guildchat.<br>

If someone was sendin you threats in game, then report them.  I hope you get them banned.<br>
<br>
But I fail to see what this has to do with the calendar.  I seriouly doubt it was anyone that is discussiong these issues with you here.  <br>

<br>
but I have to say i think you're both doing a disservice to the calendar at this point by continuing to argue with jamany.<br>
<br>
jamany is not interested in discourse.  jamany &gt;is&lt; interested in trolling, ad hominem arguments, poisoning the well, guilt by association and other exciting logical fallacies common to rhetoric and debate.<br>
<br>
every time a discussion comes up that begins to lead somewhere, jamany winds everyone up with the standard &quot;i've been threatened! help help i'm being oppressed!&quot; line.  As for the truth of the claim, ref: Little, Chicken.<br>
<br>
if jamany wants to do something about it, do it.  but since there's no common ground and no dialog happening anyomre (Except in flames. woo!) i say to hell with it.<br>
<br>
every single person here (including jamany) has better things to do with their time than argue about whether or not the calendar system is good.<br>
<br>
if someone new shows up, hey great.  Glad to get into it all over again and re-explain and re-reference and post URLs and talk about the reasoning.  That's how people learn stuff.<br>
<br>
but all these discussions right now are simply a broken record that's playing at 78RPM.  It's skipping repeatedly &amp; nobody can quite figure out why they're listening to it in the first place.<br>

Im tired of hearing one or two people run this argument around and around.  <br>
<br>
The server is not your god damn mother and father.  Do whatever the hell it is you want to.  Just know that there is a LARGE group of people who agreed to abide by something so they would not get in each other's way.  <br>
<br>
Also know that these entities would rather not have to deal with your interference by bringing in a handfull of people to farm repops you did NOTHING to help clear in the first place.  They won't care to be around you should you go that route.<br>
<br>
<br>
You sound like a god damn broken record, shut the fuck up and stop trying to justify any of this crap, cause you CANNOT justify an agreemnet between a large group of people.  They offer to let you be apart of this agreement so long as you follow the same conformities EVERYONE ELSE IN THE AGREEMENT does.  <br>
<br>
THIS SUCKS, I AGREE WITH YOU, however the alternative is total chaos, and no one wins in chaos.<br>
<br>
Now PLEASE shut the fuck up already. <p><font color = green size = 4> Manas Pineblade, Woodlands Stalker<br>
