<br>
FACT: The Bible was told by word of mouth for generations for over 1000 years before some guys living in some high tech housing (Caves, mud huts and sometimes mud brick...ooo) Wrote it down on a bunch of scrolls then stuffed them in a cave for the most part, while copys at the time were all hand written word by word (Sorry copy machines still 2500 years away) Then someone from Grease says &quot;Hey this is cool shit&quot; and translates it from ancient dialects of some far away land (Yes 300 miles was far away in them days.) to Greek and may or may not have done a good job with it. From there these people who spoke English (Ok old ass English you would never understand) Rewrote it into English from Greek. Now remember all this is over the course of some 3 or 4000 years by hand for most of that time....The moral of this you ask? The bible is full of great storys that modern science might be able to prove fact, at least that some of the places and people did really exist, but remember that the people who wrote the bible were normal everyday people who transferred word by word and not all of the words translate, some have many different meanings or are what you might say is slang for that time. <br>
<br>
The general moral of the bible is all that really matters and oddly enough its Dr. Lauras motto that I think we can all agree is not something offensive.<br>
<br>
Do the right thing.<br>

<br>
Most religions use things &quot;written&quot; from thousands of years ago and treat them as if they have meaning today.<br>
<br>
Some do, some do not.<br>
<br>
Homosexuality is.  Your choice (however much you might have in it).  Gay bashing is wrong, but humans being what they are make right and wrong and that only changes over time.<br>
<br>
Racism is wrong, but it exists.  Same idea here folks.<br>
<br>
Think of all the good things that religion gets you.  If you are into it fine.  If not let em do what they want.  Personal choice.<br>
<br>
However note the worst things about religion:<br>
<br>
- more people killed over religious wars than anything else (or at least that was the excuse) prior to the 20th century.  Look at the crap in the mid-east right now.<br>
<br>
- Religion adds one huge set of rules to life that has enough &quot;civil&quot; rules to keep you busy.  <br>
<br>
What the hell does something written 2000 years ago mean today on, say, dietary conditions like mixing meat &amp; milk products???<br>
<br>
Far too much of modern religion is based on things written long ago and &quot;taken&quot; as having the same meaning today that it had 500 or more years ago.<br>
<br>
As a result, like any institution (government, business, army, etc...) it forms a system that guarantees that it is unlikely to become redundant and makes it try and last forever.<br>
<br>
When was the last time you heard a major religion say, our beliefs are kinda outdated, lets close shop while we update them to reflect modern times?<br>
<br>
Like the Pope on birth control (and not even touching abortions).  What can be bad about trying to stop population growth in areas of the world where the average person is underfed and large numbers of children die due to being underfed, overcrowded and dirt poor?<br>
<br>
Live and let live.  Religions cannot move to accept change rapidly (or even slowly much of the time) and idiots like Dr. Laura are the types that tend to keep things messed up for far too many people in this messed up world.<br>

<br>
Most people feel this way. Though some do have many strict guidelines, most people incorrectly assume this of every faith. It's not necessarily true. So many people quote the Old Testament saying, &quot;What about sacrafices?&quot;, &quot;What about multiple wives&quot;, etc are we supposed to do those still cause it's in the Bible? However there is a reason for the separation of Old and New Testament. Christainity believes that Christ died for the sins of man and from that point on the guidelines that had once been followed were now changed.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I have to believe that it's not a very good excuse to say I don't believe in something because it's too hard.<br>
<br>

<br>
Wouldn't castration be a much better solution in those areas?<br>
<br>
It's not about population control. If the pope were to condone birth control it's almost as if the Pope is condoning fornication. The majority of people using birth control aren't married (look at the average married couples sex life and you'll see what I mean). I'm sure the Pope doesn't want people dieing from overpopulation, however condoning something like birth control has adverse affects and may come across with a different meaning, much like &quot;The pope said it's ok as long as I use birth control&quot;. And no, I'm not Catholic.<br>

I'm betting not very many of you. Yet you behave as sheep and completely believe word for word what was written in the original post about her.<br>
<br>
I use to listen to her just about everyday while I was on the road. She could have done a straight(no pun intended) advice radio show but choose to rip off Howard Stern and spice up a normally boring format. She's really not much different than Judge Judy if you think about it. <br>
<br>
If you call her show with a 'real' problem and act like a decent human being, she will treat you that way. But if you are a complete moron who calls up for advice a dead dog could give you, she will treat you like said moron. Personally, I found that refreshing and quite humorous despite the fact that she loathed the man who made this type of show possible in the first place. Now THERE'S some hypocrisy for you!<br>
<br>
As for the claims that she hates homosexuals, that's complete bullshit! I heard many gay men and women(as well as teens) call into her show asking for help with one dilemma or another. &quot;How do I tell my family I'm gay?&quot;.....&quot;I'm married but I now realize I'm gay, should I get a divorce?&quot;......&quot;The kids at school tease me everyday that my mom is gay, how can I make them stop?&quot;.....&quot;I think I'm HIV positive but I'm afraid to go to the doctor&quot;.....&quot;I'm thinking about killing myself...No one understands.&quot;...etc.<br>
<br>
Each and everyone of these questions were taken seriously and answered with the utmost respect for the caller. She was extremely sympathetic in those situations and took more than the normal amount of time to handle each of these crises. <br>
<br>
Did she rip on the gay man who knows he's gay but wants to marry a woman anyways? Or the married gay dude who's doing the backdoor boogie with strangers in various park bathrooms? You better fucking believe she did! The only way a true dumbfuck can change is to make that dumbfuck understand that he's a dumbfuck in the first place! And she did that beautifully!<br>
<br>
When asked from a religious point of view about homosexuality, she gave an honest answer. As an Orthodox Jew, she felt it was a sin. Plain and simple. Should she have lied about her beliefs? I think not.<br>
<br>
Test time for the males and manginas among us:<br>
<br>
Pick which set of answers best describes the way you feel at the thought of you engaging in a homosexual act.<br>
<br>
A) Excited, fascintated, curious, hungry, aroused...etc.<br>
<br>
Or...<br>
<br>
B) Disgusted, sickened, suicidal, loathsome, feeling like you are going to puke up all the Ding Dongs you ate while playing EQ for the past 3 years...etc.<br>
<br>
With the exception of a few of you boy lovers out there, the answer will be B. Does the fact that you feel this way mean you hate homos? Of course not. Feeling that way is perfectly natural and normal. However, acting out on those feelings in a viscious or violent way is 100% wrong. Make no mistake about that!<br>
<br>
One last thing, those pictures of her were taken a long time ago. To claim she is a hypocrite now because of something she did 20 years ago is pretty lame. She's talked extensively on the air about those pictures and the type of person she was back then. If they had been taken at some point while she was doing her radio show, she would be fair game for an all out orgy of NT flames. But they weren't, so STFU!<br>
<br>
Next time you want to open your bitchy yap about her, Rush, or even the King of All Media himself, try listening to them first instead of just acting like a bunch of fucking &lt;BAAAAAAAA&gt; sheep. Educated opinion&gt;than all.<br>

THE BAD<br>
Sure shes entertaining. But I started to see through her bullshit after a few months of regular listening. Shes a hat3r who misses the point and gives bad advice on a REGULAR basis, while trying to act like she knows what shes talking about, even if she has no clue how to answer the question. Also, some of her opinions are dangerously stupid and bigoted. Why is she so fervently anti-homosexual? WHO GIVES A FUCK.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE GOOD<br>
Im not saying I disagree with everything she says, far from it. I think her hard-ass stance on divorcees, cheaters, and other sundry idiots can be hilarious when they call her up and she gives them the 3rd degree for fucking up their lives and crying about it.<br>

This is what I don't understand...<br>
<br>
1. Why is Dr. Laura on the radio when should should be spending her time in the kitchen and popping out kids?<br>
<br>
2. Doesn't she know women have no place in the church, why does she think she can teach the Bible? Only men are qualified to do that.<br>
<br>
3. Did someone say she has a Ph.D. in physiology? You have to study evolution to get one of those /gasp!<br>
<br>
4. Why is my name Laura and I am going to get a doctorate in math physiology &gt;&lt; <p><a href="http://www.crimsontempest.com/" target="_blank">

<br>
so i take it your saying people are somewhat born with it? quite possibly some people change through life maybe even very early which is is how usually things start and begin to effect the mind . <br>
<br>
you can be meant to be a murderer<br>
meant to be dumb<br>
meant to be smart<br>
meant to not care<br>
meant to cry about everything ...<br>
meant to be nice<br>
meant to be mad<br>
<br>
Either way meant for wahtever has nothing to do with the only 2 things that do.  being damned to hell and being gay are somewhat similar under christian belief it is going to lead to the SAME thing.Damnnation in hell. therefore andyone  who is &quot;meant to be gay&quot; is going to hell anyway Same boat. *But everyone has the chance for salvation  *<br>
some people believe some people don't .. what ever completely different things the people think they are still in 1 of 2 categories it's that simple . heaven or hell<br>
<br>
Could you elaborate on your last post uggmo i think i may have missunderstood what you really were trying to say.<br>

Bottomline is that you want me to accept something that goes against what I believe but in turn you will not accept that I do not accept it. In turn you call me and anyone who opposes you ignorant, but to us you are JUST as ignorant because you really have no real understanding of where we are coming from. To you its just fairytales but to us it is our beliefs. Look at what your attitude is towards people of any faith and realize that you exhibit the very same attitude that you are bitching at us for but about something you personally don't agree with.

Neither.  I am not attracted to women, I am attracted to men. Simple as that. I'm not sickened, suicidal, loathsome or otherwise... why should I be?The only people I know who feel this way, are those who are insecure about their own sexuality, or afraid of someone elses. (side note: I listened to Dr. Laura at work for over a year - not by choice - and while some of what she said was good, I didn't agree with 99% of it, or how she handled most of her callers)<br>

here is something for you to think about. exponential growth in a population is detrimental, and cannot go on forever. why would it be so far fetched that homosexuality is a natural occurance in ANY population (human or otherwise) to curb exponential growth? just like all people were not meant to bear children (without help) it makes sense that within a population certain people (or animals whatever) would not be physically attracted to the opposite sex thus not producing offspring. /shrug<br>
<br>
king ralo i wonder if you have ever truly *known* someone who was homosexual, not just known one, or met one before, but truly known the person. if you had you would have known that this wasn't just a sexual perversion, it's much more than that... it's not a choice, it's who you are. from my understanding of the christian faith and the bible you aren't &quot;damned to hell&quot; for sinning, you're &quot;damned to hell&quot; is for not accepting jesus christ as the lord and savior. telling someone that they will be damned to hell for not &quot;behaving&quot; under your guidelines isn't my idea of a loving, caring, forgiving religion; and if that's the kind of person you have to be to go to heaven, well count me out i'd rather get a tan in hell thanks. <br>
<br>
Kuwen, i don't think most of these people here consider those who simply don't agree with homosexuality based on their beliefs ignorant. it's those who take it to the next level, those who come out and spew hatred and fear of what they do not understand that i consider &quot;ignorant&quot;. You're more than welcome to believe what you wish, as am I. But I won't let those who lash out at my beliefs continue to do so without rebuttal. Especially on the issue of homosexuality, where they are lashing out at someone i love not just my beliefs. Heh... what's funny is I consider myself a christian. I believe in God and Jesus, and the general ideals (be good to others, don't lie, din't cheat, don't steal...etc...) yet I butt heads with other christians (catholics too) all the time. But I don't consider them ignorant, we just have different opinions of life...  <p><center><img src="http://sydniasoulhealer.homestead.com/files/SydniaREE4x2.JPG"></img>

i had an art teacher who i tought was the greatest teacher in the world , and before the summer course was over i found out he was gay . it was as shock but regardless  ... he still stands as a great teacher to me and was a very nice person.<br>
<br>
reading your post sydnia made me remember him .. after re thinking you may be right about the choice thing but i have known some people to be gay for sexual deviacy (spelled wrong) and isn't that a choice also to be corrupt ?. and I only have known of one deemably &quot;good&quot; person that was gay and I treat him like a nromal person. i guess i have i have a lack of meeting people like them .<br>
im sorry if i seemed unfair i meant being gay//lesbian was a different form of sexuality . like being straight or bi-sexual. I believe it was the &quot;examples i gave that clouded that statement up .<br>

sorry if my post made you think i meant that it is your persona that gets you into heaven because that is not what i meant.<br>
they way you said it &quot;christ being the only way&quot; is what i meant to say , please excuse me if it did not turn out that way.<br>

i turly agree with your statement on hate , because it will not solve anything and we should not hate gay//lesbian people becuase regardless they are our brothers//sitsters and family members who are all equal to us.and hurting them would only hurt us.<br>
