<br>
Saga of House Ellesarien<br>
<br>
Chapter One - Loss<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Sandalorn, Watch the mounts little brother&quot;, Dannen spoke over his shoulder as the elven hunting party disappeared into the Emerald Forest around them.<br>
&quot;But I never get to come along&quot; Sandalorn replied moodily. This was the sixth hunting party this month that he had to stay behind and watch the mounts as his brothers and the rest of the hunting party struck back against the slow tide of goblins and orcs which threatened to invade the forest around their ancient ancestral home; ‘Tor Anrouk’.<br>
Dannen’s laughter wafted back to him from the surrounding forest “You are not yet ready brother. Don’t you worry; you will wet your swords soon enough.”<br>
<br>
Scowling and muttering under his breath, Sandalorn steadied his nerves and thoughts while he tried to calm himself to find the “Any’llia’. Loosely translated to mean ‘Peace’ in the Common tongue, The ‘Any’llia’ was the place his father and brothers told him their weapon mastery came from. A place where time slowed and body and mind worked in sync to harness the Ellesarien power and might. Their house was of an ancient lineage; one of the first families created by Tunare. In fact, they were one of the only Elven Houses still able to hear the thoughts of Tunare from her residence in the Plane of Growth. The ‘Any’llia’ was a thought from Tunare, a piece of her love that House Ellesarien could call upon to heighten their battle senses and movements.<br>
<br>
As he started to move through his lessons and stances, the ‘Any’llia’ gently washed over Sandalorn. As he became closer to his Goddess, his thoughts and movements became sharper and more defined. From one stance to the next, he moved around the clearing in a dance of blades; the silver reflection of the moon glancing off his swirling twin swords. In his heightened state, the distance yells of fighting penetrated his concentration. As he slowed his dance and listened closer, he could hear a wild commotion and the angry screams of many orcs far away in the forest. He smiled to himself as he thought about his three brothers dealing out damage and death to their evil foes. Dannen, Grefanix, and Trelot were all very watchful over him he knew. They tried to prevent him from entering the councils and meetings that they and their father, Inglorian, held about the orc and goblin hordes. But Sandalorn had found a way around that a while ago and now listened in to all their palavers through the small hole in the ceiling where he lay perched for hours upon end. He knew that things were growing worse and soon an all out war would wage through the Ellesarien lands.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the entire forest exploded in a vile red light; throwing corrupted reflections of the noble trees of the Emerald Forest down across Sandalorn. The distant screams of the orcs quickly changed to chants and battle cries. Sandalorn knew that something unexpected had happened and quickly got the horses ready in case the hunting party returned in haste. More explosions and flashes of the evil red light echoed across the forest as teems of wildlife burst into the clearing and past him.<br>
<br>
“Sandalorn!!” his brother Trelot’s voice exploded in his mind. “You must take the horses and flee..Now! We are overrun by…..something evil…I do not know what it is. But we are overpowered and dropping quickly. We will meet up with you at the mill”. <br>
<br>
It had been years since one of his brothers had used the ‘Meshing’ to contact him in his mind. The link contained emotions too…Pain and fear washed upon him as the link transferred his brother’s feelings to him. The sudden intensity of emotions brought Sandalorn to one knee, shaking his head and trying to stay conscious as his mind struggled to regain its footing. He could not leave his kin, his brothers, his family. He would not run when they were in danger.<br>
<br>
“No Trelot” he thought back across the link. “I will not run. I will hold the horses for you here. Come quickly”.<br>
<br>
“You fool!” his brother screamed into his mind. “We probably won’t even make it back to the horses. Flee now for your life. Evil is in these woods and we are undone.”<br>
<br>
“I will not abandon you brother” Sandalorn replied quietly. The “Any’llia” was absorbing itself into him again, washing away his fear and anxiety. “I will be here with the horses when you return”.<br>
<br>
“Fool” Trelot spoke again. “We are close. Be ready then little brother; for we bring death along with us”.<br>
<br>
The quiet ring of steel being drawn was Sandalorn’s only reply. He waited, poised for battle in the clearing as he heard destruction draw closer. Suddenly Grefanix dashed into the clearing, blood streaming from multiple wounds and from his….ears?<br>
<br>
“We are in dire straights Sandalorn” Grefanix breathed through gasps as he tried to catch his breath. “Something is out there…Something evil like I have never seen. We are doomed I believe, but you are not!”. With that Grefanix grabbed Sandalorn and started to stuff dirt in his ears, quickly cutting out all sound.<br>
<br>
“What are you doing?” Sandalorn exclaimed. “Have you gone mad?”.<br>
<br>
Grefanix’s reply was barely heard “I am saving you little brother. Now run fast and don’t look back”<br>
<br>
Sandalorn reply was cut off as hell entered the clearing. His two other brothers; Dannen and Trelot, burst into the clearing along with two others from the elven hunting party. “Just five left” Sandalorn whispered to himself. What in the name of Tunare is happening?”<br>
<br>
His question was soon answered as a creature walked slowly into the clearing. He was huge; 14ft. easily and surrounding by a flowing red cape. He seemed to be playing some type of musical instrument and singing loudly. Only the dirt stuffed into Sandalorn’s ears prevented him from really hearing what the creature was singing. <br>
<br>
His three brothers and the other two elven hunters all collapsed to the ground, holding their ears tightly as blood poured from them. Sandalorn stood stunned as his life shattered down around him.<br>
<br>
“Poor elves” the creature spoke haughtily. Sandalorn could just barely hear him through his clogged ears. “You have incurred the wrath of my master and now your punishment is at hand. This forest has been claimed in his name and you stop his plan for going forth with your killing of his minions. But you will be repaid ten-fold! For he has sent me to do his bidding and my wrath is unquenchable. No ones escapes the Maestro of Rancor!!”<br>
<br>
The creature turned his burning eyes to Sandalorn. “What have we here? Another little elf for the slaughter. Good…we can always use more. But why are you still standing? Can you not hear my beautiful music?”<br>
<br>
“Flee little brother…Flee now!” Dannen’s voice entered his mind. Dannen’s voice was quiet and intense. “You can’t save us. We are dying already. His music is death and we have listened. Go to father and tell him what happened. GO NOW!”<br>
<br>
Sandalorn took one quick last glance as his brothers and ran. Dannen’s voice brooked no compromise. He must tell father. He could hear nothing as he ran and ran through the forest, heading towards the mill where their backup mounts rested. He was getting near the mill when he turned around a tree and ran smack directly into the flat of a sword blade.<br>
<br>
The last thing he heard before darkness swarmed in was his brothers screams in his head……<br>
<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 – Love of a Goddess<br>
<br>
<br>
He was alone..completely alone. His brother’s voices and presence were gone from his mind, leaving a void he never knew existed. He had woken up in a dark, dank cell of stone. The cell was filled with decaying bones, refuse, and a thin layer of molding straw. Some of the bones seemed newer than others; signs that he was not the only recent prisoner this cell had seen. Thick iron shackles held his arms outstretched against the cold, wet surface of a stone wall. Sandalorn had long ago given up trying to keep himself upright and now hung limply from his shackles. He knew not how long he had been down here alone. Time seemed to have no meaning in the black silence of his cell. But since he had not been given anything to eat or drink since he woke, it couldn’t have been more than a few days. He wandered in and out of consciousness as his hunger and thirst kept waking him up from the restless slumber his weakness and exhaustion forced upon him.<br>
<br>
Sandalorn tried not to think of the vast void that now filled his being. His brothers were gone; killed by that creature that called itself The Maestro of Rancor. He never knew just how much the presence of his brothers had meant to him until it was gone. It seemed he was not a whole person anymore, just a dried husk without any inner self-awareness. A tiny mote lost inside the awesome expanse of the universe. He would die down here he knew; cold and alone. His corpse would never lie besides his ancestors; beneath the ground around Tor Anrouk; and thus would never make its journey to the Plane of Growth to be besides his deity. His thoughts turned darker and darker as his life force started to wan and extinguish.<br>
<br>
“Sandalorn….Hear me my faithful” a voice penetrated the soft layer of despair that covered Sandalorn’s mind. “You must not give up hope. You will have a chance to enact revenge upon those who have caused such grief amongst the noble Ellesarien lands. But you must be ready to grab that chance; it comes quickly now.”<br>
<br>
Sandalorn forced himself through the darkness that covered his consciousness. The words had little meaning to him. They were keeping him from the long sleep he deserved. “Go away..Leave me alone to die down here. My brothers are no more. I will join them in awhile.”<br>
<br>
“Sandalorn!” the voice pounded in his head. The power inherent in that voice brought him to full consciousness. “You were not meant to die in this foul place. I have need of you. Your family has served me well since the creation of the of your race, now it is your turn to take up the banner of Tunare and do my bidding upon Norrath” <br>
<br>
“No!” he screamed in the darkness. “I want no more…let me die with my brothers. Let me have peace”. <br>
<br>
“Coward” the voice shattered his thoughts. “Would you have your brothers die in vain? Right now your ancestral home of Tor Anrouk is being overrun by Innoruk’s foul minions and you are busy whimpering in the dark. Would you let your noble family fade into history? Would you abandon your father and mother?”<br>
<br>
“I’m sorry….What can I do down here?” Sandalorn said sorrowfully. “I have not seen or heard anything since my imprisonment. No one is coming to help me..I am alone”<br>
<br>
Suddenly the presence of his loving god Tunare filled his entire being. Exhaustion and pain faded away as energy surged through his frame. “You have never been alone my faithful. I am always here. I will always be here…and I need you my Sandalorn. I need you to be my weapon of vengeance upon the God of Hate.”<br>
<br>
The soft sound of shuffling feet walking upon stone could now be heard faintly in the darkness. “Your chance for escape draws near, young Sandalorn. Are you ready to fight for your life and the life of your family? Are you ready to walk the path of righteousness? To be the hand and sword of your Goddess?”<br>
<br>
Sandalorn wept quietly as the love and blessing of his Goddess washed over him. He could not let her wishes go unheeded. He would fight for her he knew. He would fight until his death darkened his sight and mind. And he would start now! “Yes, my Goddess..I will fight” he whispered. “I will fight for you. Show me how I can be of service”<br>
<br>
“Your chance draws near..be ready” the voice told him. “You must take this jailor without letting him sound an alarm.” The sound of the jailor drew closer until it stopped outside his cell.<br>
<br>
The sound of the cell door being opened broke the thick silence in the dark. It gave a loud creak as it opened to allow a smallish orc to enter carrying a small plate of molding bread and foul smelling water. It sneered at him as it placed the plate on the floor in front of him. Sandalorn did not understand how he was supposed to eat and drink while still being chained to the wall. He assumed that he would be released from his shackles in order to consume the food on the floor. Realization struck hard as the orc jailor spat in his face and then turned around to leave. It never had any intention of letting him eat and drink. It was just another cruel trick to further his torture down in this hellish place. His sight blurred as anger washed over him. They would all pay for this..all of them.<br>
<br>
At the same time the voice rang in his head, saying “Now..Act Now!”, his shackles came free of the wall. Sandalorn fell heavily but the energy and wrath of his Goddess inside his mind forced him quickly back to his feet. The jailor turned at the sound of him hitting the floor…just in time to catch the full force of the thick chain hanging from his shackles across the face. The soft twinkling sound of bone rattled across the stone floor as the jailor’s head exploded in a bloom of red. <br>
<br>
Sandalorn quickly moved to the jailor’s corpse and found a thick set of keys inside the corpses filthy jacket. He thought quickly of trying on some of the foul orc’s clothing, but the thought of wearing anything that these orcs had touched was abhorrent to him. So dressed in only his grimy loincloth, he slowly started to move silently back up the stone hallway that the jailor had traversed. His Goddess’s presence still enveloped him, keeping him full of energy and righteous rage.<br>
<br>
His Goddess’s voice once again penetrated his thoughts. “Not it is up to you my faithful. I will keep you filled with my presence, but I cannot help you anymore than that. You must find your own way out. But I will tell you this; these orcs helped kill your brothers. They were under The Maestro’s command when he killed them.”<br>
<br>
Sandalorn inwardly nodded as he strode through the dark stone hallways. His rage was reaching a head; filling his body with purpose and desire. He wanted to slay all of these foul beings. He wanted to watch their blood run red on the stones.<br>
<br>
After a short while, the air started to freshen and he could hear the sounds of multiple voices echoing down the halls. Sandalorn quickened his pace and soon found himself outside a thick wooden door. The thick, loud voices of orcs behind the door fueled his inner fire as he tried to find the ‘Any’llia’. He slowed his breathing and let his anger and rage disappear as the ‘Any’llia’ washed over him. His thoughts and sight cleared as power and strength coursed through his body. He tested the door and found it unlatched.<br>
<br>
His sudden rush into the room caught the orcs by surprise. His brain registered the room as he burst into the chamber. A crude wooden table sat in the center of the room, chairs of equal craftsmanship surrounding it. A pile of meat and ale filled the table from edge to edge. Apparently the orcs had not feared reprisal and were celebrating their victory. Refuse filled all corners of the room; remnants of meals and other more horrid things piled on one another. Torches along the east and west walls filled the room with smoky light. And across the room, an open door leading to a faint light beckoned him. He also registered the eight orcs that occupied the room; four sitting around the table and the other four lounging lazily on the floor, some even snoring loudly from a drunken stupor. <br>
<br>
All this flashed across his vision as his thick chains swept down upon the closest orc. The wet pop of the orc’s head as it caved in swept over the room and brought Sandalorn to the orcs full attention. Options ran quickly through Sandalorn’s head as he surveyed the remaining seven orcs in front of him. They were spreading out now; crude swords or axes in their hands. He had hoped that his surprise would last longer or that maybe the orcs in their celebration would not have their weapons ready, but that didn’t seem to be the case. Though half drunk, these orcs were battle hardened and had rallied quickly after the initial surprise of his entrance.<br>
<br>
Two orcs suddenly rushed him together, coming around the table from opposite sides. Sandalorn sprinted quickly between them, leaping across the table. His chains slapped across both orcs shoulders as he passed between them. But his situation has worsened. He was now surrounded, standing on the far side of the table. The two orcs he had hit had brushed off the blows by his chains and were now turning to face him on the other side of the table. His options and hopes fading, Sandalorn made a quick fake to one side then moved quickly in the other, catching an orc leaning the wrong way. His right chain splattered the orc’s nose and slapped him back against the wall, which he slid down; stunned. His left chain missed and swung full force against the stone wall. The chain shattered against the wall, breaking off right above his wrist. Now left with only one weapon, he slowly backed himself into a corner, watching the remaining orcs warily.<br>
<br>
Sudden pain from his feet divided his attention briefly as he took a quick glance down. Blood was leaking slowly from a thin gash on the side of his left foot. Sandalorn found the culprit and inhaled deeply. The cold blue tint of Elven Mithril steel poked up through the refuse in this corner. Still staring down the slowly approaching orcs, Sandalorn reached down and brought his hands back up…filled with two ancestral blades of House Ellesarien. Apparently the orcs had just thrown his weapons in the corner of the room until they could be examined later. Food and ale had been foremost in their minds. They would pay for that decision.<br>
<br>
The familiar and comforting feel of his twin blades in his hand brought him into motion. The ‘Any’llia’ settled over him like a warm blanket as he moved from his corner.<br>
<br>
He danced.<br>
<br>
His twin swords were a blue blur as they took out the throat of the closest orc. Pushing the now dead orc back into its companions, Sandalorn now brought the dance of death to them. He blocked the powerful strike of an axe as it arched toward his neck. The loud ring as the two weapons struck echoed inside the small room. Using the axe’s momentum, he pushed it out wide and move inside its arc. His left sword swept the axe owner’s head clean off. The headless body took one step back, pumping blood in the air before it slumped down on the floor with a wet thud. Before the dead body hit the floor, Sandalorn was past and into the remaining orc force. He kneeled down and spun, his sword sweeping back up to gut an orc from groin to chest. Entrails washed down onto the floor as the orc followed his band members into the silence of death. Sandalorn was back on his feet before any of the remaining four orcs could even take advantage of his weakened position. He parried weapon after weapon as he fought to stay in charge of the battle. The four came at him simultaneously; sword following axe in a constant stream of blades. He took a chance and parried with his left as his right flashed over the shoulder of the lead orc and through the throat of the orc behind it. His enchanted blade easily cut through the orc’s flesh and rang against the spinal column as it severed it. His foot lashed out and caught the kneecap of lead orc, bringing it to its knees. The other two orcs, seeing death in this demon of an elf’s eyes, turned tail and fled back up the tunnel. Sandalorn’s swords flashed across the jugular of the kneeling orc as he flowed past him after the fleeing orcs.<br>
<br>
The fleeing orcs heard Sandalorn’s war cry as he chased them down the tunnel. They put their heads down and pumped their legs as quick they could, running for the rays of light a little way ahead of them. The glorious trees of the Emerald Forest could be seen through the entrance. All they needed was to get outside and into the trees; escape was possible then.<br>
<br>
They didn’t make it.<br>
<br>
Sandalorn stood above their steaming corpses as his twin swords dripped blood and gore upon the verdant floor of the forest. He could still feel the blessing and love of his Goddess Tunare coursing through his veins, keeping his energy up even though he hadn’t eaten or drank anything in days. He looked away to the east through the forest..he looked towards home. Not wanting to waste his energy while he had the chance, he started his journey.<br>
<br>
His thoughts were grim as he trod through the forest, thinking about his brothers and what might lie ahead when he found his way back to Tor Anrouk. His rage had settled but still lurked under his calm demeanor. The Maestro of Rancor and his minions had tried to end his and his family’s legacy along with their lives. But he had failed…at least one Ellesarien still lived.<br>

Chapter Three - Home<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sandalorn knelt and examined the forest floor. There were signs everywhere for those with the ability to discover them of a mass movement of orcs through the area. It had taken him over two weeks to reach the outskirts of his ancestral home, Tor Anrouk. The thoughts of his Goddess echoed in his memory; “Right now your ancestral home of Tor Anrouk is being overrun by Innoruk’s foul minions and you are busy whimpering in the dark. Would you let your noble family fade into history? Would you abandon your father and mother?” Those words had reached him down in that dank cell where he had been held prisoner and the thought of it had brought up his rage enough to enable him to escape with his Goddess’s help. Since that day, he had moved quickly through the Emerald Forest towards his home, following the path left by the orcs as it wound directly towards Tor Anrouk. He wondered with anxiety what he would find when he finally arrived home. The fear and dread once again started to boil to the surface and he tried to force his thoughts towards the ‘Any’llia’ to calm himself. That of course would never work. You could not force yourself towards the ‘Any’llia’. You had to reach out with love to Tunare; in her the ‘Any’llia’ was found. It took awhile, but soon he was able to balance his thoughts and emotions enough to enter the ‘Any’llia’ and mull over the options that were available to him. He decided to wait here until the cover of nightfall would hide him even more as he approached the tower.<br>
<br>
A few hours later found him at the last ring of trees before the wide clearing that approached the tower. Tor Anouk had certainly been the orcs destination; the small village that surrounded the tower had been utterly destroyed. Bodies of his elven people were scattered everywhere, some in hideous poses left by the orcs for others to find. Circling the tower were stakes adorned with the corpses of elven nobility, including his Ellesarien kin. In the middle, directly in front of the main gate into the tower, stood the stakes where his father and mother were impaled. Sandalorn stared aghast at the pure violence at what had transpired here. The mouths of his parents were stretched wide in a shout of immense pain. Something else besides what was seen had been done to them. His father never would have shown weakness, even in his death. Looking around the clearing, he noticed that all the corpses seemed to have been killed in the midst of a scream. This was a message that needed no seer to explain. It shouted “Those that fight against the might of Innoruk would be utterly destroyed and left as a witness for those that follow”.<br>
<br>
Sandalorn had no knowledge of how long he remained hidden in the trees. His mind simply retreated into itself, looking for a place to hide so he wouldn’t have to come to grips with the loss of his entire life. Finally the continued sight of his parents in their state brought him out of his torpor and fully into rage. Red blinded his vision as thoughts of revenge flashed across his mind. As he stood and started to move towards the stakes, a hand grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back. Even as he twisted hard in the grasp of the person or thing behind him, he cursed himself. How could I have been so stupid? How did I let myself be caught unaware? Even the earliest elven child would not have been caught this way.<br>
<br>
“Steady..Calm yourself young elf” a voice whispered in his ear. Elven! The voice spoke elven, though not of the dialect that the Tor Anrouk elves used.<br>
<br>
Sandalorn let himself relax as the stranger elf turned him around. The elf was no fool though; the grip on Sandalorn did not lessen at all. This stranger was taking no chances and Sandalorn was helpless in his grasp. The stranger’s hands felt like vises as he made sure Sandalorn knew the situation as it stood. As he turned, he finally got a glimpse of his capturer. The stranger was a wood elf alright, having quite a few features in common with the Tor Anrouk elves. His eyes though were a brilliant blue in comparison to Sandalorn’s emerald eyes. He was clad head to toe in forest green chain mail. Etching of ivy leaves wrapped around the armor, making the stranger eerily invisible when looking into the backdrop of the trees behind him. Sandalorn’s mind registered the fact that this elf was most likely wearing the famed Ivy Etched Armor that was whispered in only legends around these parts. His cautiousness and anxiety grew as he wondered now what he had gotten himself into. But he had grown greatly in the past few weeks and would not be cowed by this elf.<br>
<br>
“Who are you trespassing on my lands?” Sandalorn asked intensely. “Have you had anything to do with what happened here? If so elf, your life is forfeit..it is mine to take”<br>
<br>
The strangers eyes grew even grimmer and his grasp became stronger, cutting off the circulation to Sandalorn’s upper arm. “I will forgive you that insult young one because of the loss you have taken. But be warned…One more comment like that and I will leave you here to rot in this forest”.<br>
<br>
The elf stared into Sandalorn’s eyes and took in his appearance. His gaze focused briefly on the twin Ellesarien blades across both shoulders and his grip lessened noticeably. “So..which one are you?”<br>
<br>
“One what?” Sandalorn replied warily.<br>
<br>
“Which Ellesarien are you? By your youth you must be Grefanix or Sandalorn.”<br>
<br>
“How do you know my name? Who are you?” Sandalorn asked quietly. His apprehension was starting to rise again.<br>
<br>
“ My name is not important, but if you must know..it is Andoril. I was a friend of your brother Dannen. We met awhile ago while in the commission of the Felwithe high elves.” He shook his head slowly, his eyes filling with grief. “He became like a brother to me..I am sorry his life has passed. He had much greatness in his future.”<br>
<br>
“You knew Dannen?” Sandalorn said as he searched his memory of many a night sitting around the fire drinking wine, listening to Dannen’s stories that he brought back from Faydwer.<br>
<br>
Suddenly one memory fused into focus. Dannen’s face tightened into a grimace of pain as he recounted night after night battling the Crushbone Orcs in the Greater Faydark Forest. “He saved my life countless times my brothers” Dannen’s words washed upon the shores of his mind. “He is the truest friend I could have…Strong, brave and bold, and reckless in his own life to save yours. If you ever need help and I am not here, go and search for Andoril”. The memory faded as quick as it had arrived.<br>
<br>
Sandalorn twisted out of the now weakened grasp. “Aye..He talked about you. Said we could trust you”. He paused and then finally decided he really had no other choice. “I am the youngest; Sandalorn. I am all that is left. My family is dead”. The sound of those words in the air finally brought home the pain and loss and Sandalorn was soon weeping quietly as he knew he was totally alone.<br>
<br>
Andoril moved quietly back into the trees to let the young elf grieve in privacy. He liked this Ellesarien too. He reminded him much of his brother and Andoril had yet to meet one as noble as Dannen. “Let’s hope that Ellesarien blood runs as deep in this one as his brother. He will need it to survive this”, he thought to himself as he listened to the young Ellesarien letting his grief out. But this was dangerous and they needed to leave quick. He had not found any signs that the orcs were still around, but this felt like a trap to him. <br>
<br>
He coughed quietly as he moved back towards Sandalorn. The young elf had composed himself and now radiated a sense of calm. Andoril smiled to himself even as he could not help feeling a tad jealous. Apparently Sandalorn had found the ‘Any’llia’ that Dannen had talked about so much. He had witnessed countless times the swirling entity of death that Dannen had become when he found that personal calm. He sighed as he thought about all his people had lost in their exodus to Greater Faydark and his elven tree city of Kelethin. They no longer felt Tunare’s presence and the ‘Any’llia’ was just another bit of lost lore that his elders told the youth of Kelethin about.<br>
<br>
His thoughts were interrupted as he spied Sandalorn starting to move out into the clearing. He quickly moved towards the young elf and grabbed his arm again. “I don’t think that is wise young Ellesarien” he spoke quietly. “This feels like a trap to me”<br>
<br>
Sandalorn stopped quickly and perused the surrounding area. “Do you sense anything? I haven’t felt the presence of an orc in a few hours. I think they have left”. He looked back towards his parents and grimaced. “I can’t leave them like that. I need to bury them all. They will not reach Tunare until they return to the earth.”<br>
<br>
Andoril nodded, “I know Sandalorn”. He knew that the young elf would never leave until this task was done. “Let us be quick then”; He moved into the clearing first, his eyes and senses encompassing the surrounding forest.<br>
<br>
He heard Sandalorn following him as he moved towards the elder Ellesariens impaled on the hideous stakes. He drew Wyrmslayer from beneath his cloak and chopped both stakes down by their base. The sound of the two corpses hitting the earth was loud in his ears..too loud. Something was not right here.<br>
<br>
He left Sandalorn to care for his parents as he moved warily around the tower, chopping down the stakes that held the corpses of noble elven blood. His own grief was starting to rise as he thought about the loss here. So many elven dead. So many that they couldn’t afford to lose. Who will strike and hold back the tide that was Innoruk if not the elves? His thoughts raged as he completed his grisly task. Innoruk would pay for this. He would pay in full. <br>
<br>
Sandalorn had completed the burial of his parents. He felt such loss that it was almost overwhelming. At least they would be with Tunare now, helping her in her battle against evil. He rose and went to bury the rest of his people. It would take awhile…there were many corpses. He noticed Andoril watching the trees closely and started to sense the hints of danger. As he moved closer to Andoril, he could see that the Kelethin elf’s hands were white because he was holding his weapon so tightly. Andoril’s weapon itself was a fable….Wyrmslayer…he shook his head in disbelief as he saw legends become reality. This elf must be more than he seemed to be carrying Wyrmslayer and wearing Ivy Etched armor. He planned on finding out.<br>
<br>
Andoril turned as he heard Sandalorn approach. “There is something wrong here here”, he said. “I feel something watching us”<br>
<br>
Sandalorn watched as Andoril’s eyes tightened and focused on something behind him. The Ellesarien elf turned quickly and gasped quietly.<br>
<br>
“Leave this ground vermin” Andoril spoke loudly. “This is elven land and you are not allowed here”<br>
<br>
Stepping out from inside the tower were five elves. But they were not light elves, these were Tier’Dal…Dark elves..Servants of Innoruk himself. They were dressed in chain mail so dark blue it seemed darker than the blackest night. Silver helms covered their faces and each carried two black blades dripping some vile liquid.<br>
<br>
“This is our land now little Fier’Dal” one of the dark elves spat. “We have claimed it in our God’s name”. Suddenly he raised his hands and spoke in his dark tongue. Sandalorn felt a wave of weakness wash over him that almost brought him to his knees.<br>
<br>
He heard Andoril chanting words in Fier’Dal and as quick as it came, the weakness passed. “Beware Sandalorn. These are Innoruk’s favorites..these are his Shadowknights.”<br>
<br>
Andoril was quickly besides the younger elf. Sandalorn looked over and was surprised to see a fierce grin on the Kelethin elf’s face and a dangerous glint to his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Are you ready to strike back, noble Ellesarien” Andoril spoke loudly. “ Here is your first chance”<br>
<br>
Sandalorn found himself grinning also. This crazy elf would be the death of him. Well, he thought to himself, what better way to die then this. He swept his twin swords off his back and looked over quickly, “Aye, Andoril….I am”<br>
<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 – Resolve<br>
<br>
<br>
The silence was palpable as the elves stared at each other across the clearing. Sandalorn’s fingers tightened around the hilts of his swords as he took at the pure hate emanating from the Teir’dal’s eyes. The Tier’dal were slowly spreading apart in an attempt to surround the two Fier’dal. They moved with an almost feline grace; their moves slow and measured and they stared down the light elves.<br>
<br>
Andoril whispered to Sandalorn; his eyes never leaving the slowly moving Tier’dal, “We need to act quickly now. If we get surrounded, we are done for. They will expect us to defend or split apart and attack separately. Instead, we will attack together. Get ready and follow my lead young Ellesarien. If we don’t end this quick, they will end it for us.<br>
<br>
With a low growl, Andoril sped across the clearing with incredible pace. He reached a Tier’dal in a few heartbeats and swung his Wyrmslayer in a killing blow. The Shadowknight somehow got his blade up in time to deflect the blow just barely past his neck. But the ferocity of Andoril’s blow had been enough to put the Shadowknight off-balance and he was in a defenseless position for a brief second. He could not get his second blade up in time to stop Sandalorn’s quick swipe across his neck as the other Fier’dal rushed up from the side. The soft whisper of flesh parting heralded the end for the Tier’dal, his throat cut from end to end and leaking his lifeblood upon the ground. He took one more half-hearted swipe at Andoril before his legs gave way and he slumped to the ground, his mail gauntlets coming up to grab at his ruined throat. Wyrmslayer ended all doubt as it swept the Tier’dal’s head clean off.<br>
<br>
The other Shadowknights had acted quickly to the sudden and lightning attack from the two light elves and were in the process of launching a quick counterattack. Three were moving directly towards the Fier’dal in an obvious attempt to simply overpower them. The other held back and drew an evil looking crossbow.<br>
<br>
Without needing words, Andoril and Sandalorn quickly turned back-to-back and moved to keep the three advancing Tier’dal between them and the crossbowman. The Shadowknights took that option away as they charged suddenly and Sandalorn only had a second to witness the crossbowman run to the side to get an unobstructed shot at them before all thoughts were swept away by the force of the Tier’dal charge.<br>
<br>
The elves clashed together with a loud clamor; their swords a blur as they rang off each other. The two Fier’dal were pushed back a few feet on the initial rush of the Shadowknights, but quickly dug their heels in and held their line. Andoril gave a load scream and launched a vicious retaliation; Wyrmslayer slashing across the clean, cool air of the clearing to swipe a Teir’dal’s sword away from it’s owner. The sword went flying across the clearing to land in a puff of dust. Andoril pressed his advantage; sliding up between the widening gap in the Shadowknights line. He beat a flurry of quick, hard blows down upon the now retreating Tier’dal. The Dark elf was defending only now; his one black sword slashing in front in him, trying to keep this devil of a Fier’dal off him.<br>
<br>
Sandalorn tried to keep the other two Shadowknights from helping their weakened ally; his twin swords dancing as he deflected blow after blow. Like Andoril’s target, Sandalorn had no time or energy to launch an attack of any type. He was simply trying to stay alive and was hoping that Andoril would finish off his foe before one of the Tier’dal’s black swords found their way through his whirling defense. He knew it was only a matter of time, as these Shadowknights were fierce and deadly opponents; their years of training with a blade evident in every stroke of their swords.<br>
<br>
Suddenly his wish came true as Andoril’s power and skill finally overcame his opponent and with a lightening attack, he bashed aside the Teir’dal’s lone sword. He reversed his attack and before the Shadowknight could get his sword up in defense, he brutally slashed deep under the Tier’dal armpit. Wyrmslayer cut through links of chain mail and felt backing to sink deep into the Teir’dal’s side. The fatally wounded Shadowknight jerked violently on Wyrmslayer; then slid slowly off the legendary blade and down to the clearing floor, the light in his eyes dimming into night.<br>
<br>
The sharp twang of a loosed crossbow bolt echoed loudly in the clearing. Sandalorn took a quick glance behind him; just in time to see a cruel looking bolt slam into Andoril’s side. The force of the blow dropped Andoril to his knees, blood flowing freely around the bolt now lodged into his side. The Ranger was back on his feet in a second though, his wild cry echoing across the clearing. His hand swept out and ancient Feir’dal words tumbled from his throat. The Teir’dal crossbowman suddenly burst into flame, his night black hair quickly sparking and catching fire. The flaming Tier’dal did not panic though. He was his God’s faithful; his wrath upon this land. He uttered words in the vile language of the Tier’dal and as quickly as it came, the flames extinquished. He brought his crossbow back up to fire, only to see it charred and useless from the flames that had spread down to it. Throwing the crossbow to the ground, the Dark elf drew an ugly looking flail; its ends dripping the same vile liquid that flowed across his companion’s blades.<br>
<br>
Andoril could feel the poison of the crossbow bolt starting to flow through his system, slowing movement and thought as it raced through his bloodstream. His vision was starting to fade and lose clarity. He could see the burned Tier’dal move slowly towards him, his flail making a whirling sound as he whipped it around over his head. The Dark elf seemed to be taking his time, confident in the fast acting poison that he knew was quickly shutting down the Fier’dal system. He would rue his sloth.<br>
<br>
Sandalorn was quickly tiring, his energy fading in the constant battle against the two remaining Tier’dal swordsmen. Andoril’s soft cry of pain almost cost him his life as he turned to take another quick glance at his fellow Fier’dal. Andoril was weaving gently on his feet; his hands pressed hard against the wound in his side. But he had not dropped Wymslayer and looked to be preparing to return blows to the slowly advancing burned Tier’dal. A loud whir of a blade barely missing his throat brought Sandalorn’s attention fully back to his fight. He barely had time to get both his blades up in time to catch a furious attack by one of the Shadowknights. He cursed at himself for loosing concentration and re-doubled his efforts, his arms burning with fatigue as he brought the battle to the Tier’dal swordsman. All he needed was to get them off balance for just a second. He charged directly at one of the Shadowknights, his swords flashing in the morning sun as he pushed the Tier’dal back. He used the brief opening to slip between the two dark elves and slide behind them. Drawing a throwing dagger, he threw himself into a low roll and came up throwing in one long languid motion; the dagger rushing across the clearing to sink deep into the throat of the flail carrying Tier’dal. The Shadowknight took two more steps forward before his brain registered the fact that his lifeblood was flowing down his neck and onto his black chain mail. He finally ground to a halt, his eyes wide with surprise and fear as he crumpled to the ground, joining his fellow Shadowknights into darkness. Andoril slumped down besides the slain Teir’dal, Wyrmslayer falling softly out of his hands. The poison had finally started to slow and stop his functions.<br>
<br>
Even being as quick as he was, Sandalorn had left himself badly undefended by the two remaining Shadowknights. Without looking behind him, he threw himself into another roll, coming back up facing the Tier’dal. But he was not fast enough to stop one of the swordsmen from slashing deeply across his left wrist. His Ellesarien blade dropped from nerveless fingers as he lost feeling in his left arm. Sandalorn knew he was in deep trouble. Blood was flowing freely from the wound on his left wrist, slowly draining the energy and fire from the Fier’dal. Now left with only one sword, he knew he could not defeat both these Shadowknights. He had to do something drastic soon or all was lost. Feigning defeat he knelt on the ground, his hand reaching inside his Elven cloak. The remaining two Shadowknights grinned evilly at each other and strode forward, ready to end this battle.<br>
<br>
Sandalorn quickly drew another dagger and stabbed it as hard as he could through the leather boot of the nearest Shadowknight. The dagger pierced the tough leather easily, piercing deep into soft flesh to come rattling to a stop against bone. The Tier’dal halted and lost his concentration and focus in the pain rushing from his damaged foot. That was all the time Sandalorn needed as he came to his feet quickly; his sword following him to jerk up through the hurt Shadowknight’s groin to lodge deep in his abdomen. He tried to withdraw the blade, but the Shadowknight had twisted as he fell to the clearing floor, trapping Sandalorn’s blade and ripping it from his hand.<br>
<br>
Sandalorn only had time to turn and look as the remaining Shadowknight, glee gleaming in his twisted eyes, brought his sword up to make the final killing blow. He knew he was doomed, his life forfeit. He gave a quiet prayer to Tunare to watch his soul.<br>
<br>
Thwaaap…The sound of an arrow being released was barely recognized before the triple edged point suddenly appeared from the remaining Shadowknight’s mouth. Sandalorn watched as the Tier’dal grin was replaced by immense pain. He was staring directly into the Shadowknight’s eyes as the light winked out in them.<br>
<br>
The young Ellesarien looked behind the dying Tier’dal to see Andoril crumple to the ground, his bow grasped tightly in his hand. Even in his state of fatigue and exhaustion, Sandalorn’s mind registered the workmanship of the Elven bow. “Raincaller” he said softly to himself, shaking his head. This Felwithe elf was a warehouse to the unbelievable.<br>
<br>
Wrapping his wounded wrist and retrieving his twin swords, Sandalorn wearily walked across the clearing to his hurt comrade.<br>
<br>
