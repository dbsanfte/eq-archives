For background you should cast your mind back 2 months or so to the last time Hammerkeg tried to sell his GER to KEKE and won <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.showMessage?topicID=254.topic">popularity</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. I have not sent or received a tell from him since then. And then ....<br>

I call this piece '<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Prowess and Genius</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->'. You will see why.<br>

[00:54:14] You told Hammerkeg, 'Notwithstanding that, plz dont send me tells.'<br>
[00:54:18] Hammerkeg tells you, 'When you have the courage to stand up to me in real-life, let me know.'<br>
[00:54:24] You told Hammerkeg, 'what is it about this 'dont send me tells' thing you aren't getting.'<br>

[01:00:30] Hammerkeg tells you, 'I can imagine you have atrocious speaking and writing skills.   Your grammar and spelling errors indication atrocious writing skills.'<br>
[01:01:10] You told Hammerkeg, 'i guess im just an oxymoron.' - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (Yes , I was weak, this was the point for /ignore)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

[01:01:42] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Right, like I have already asserted previously.  LOL.   I know you fear me on a real-life level.'<br>
[01:02:19] You told Hammerkeg, 'to be honest with u i log on to kill fun stuff with my guild, not have dumb conversations with strangers.'<br>
[01:02:27] Hammerkeg tells you, 'What?'<br>
[01:02:28] Abbu begins to cast a spell.<br>

[01:03:05] Hammerkeg tells you, 'I can only hope not, LOL.'<br>
[01:03:22] You told Hammerkeg, 'no i count most of them as friends, hammerkeg, in the sense that i respect and trust them.'<br>
[01:03:43] You told Hammerkeg, 'thats why i make a distinction between them and you.'<br>
[01:03:46] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Right, because it's likely you lack that on a real-life level.'<br>
[01:04:05] Hammerkeg tells you, 'No, you cannot make a distinction between real-life and internet relationships.'<br>
[01:04:32] You told Hammerkeg, 'wow u have deep insights.'<br>
[01:05:20] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Well, it's obvious you overly prepare on a forum because your communication and writing skill are literally atrocious.'<br>
[01:05:47] You told Hammerkeg, 'you are just mad because i took 5 minutes to make u look dumb. get over it.'<br>
[01:05:56] Iaminae says, 'your breasts are looking pretty perked up today'<br>

[01:06:27] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Well, since the both of us know that's untrue, I will not bother to reply to that.'<br>
[01:06:52] You told Hammerkeg, 'ok.'<br>
[01:07:01] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Barnabuss, for the love of God, someone like you can never make someone like me appear &quot;dumb.&quot; ROFL.'<br>
[01:07:08] You told Hammerkeg, 'oops u replied.'<br>
[01:07:44] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Allow me to ask you this since you dodged my original question, &quot;Do you spend every weekend playing Everquest?&quot;'<br>
[01:08:13] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Lack of reading, friends, parties?'<br>
[01:08:22] You told Hammerkeg, 'i cant imagine why my life concerns you.'<br>
[01:08:26] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Honestly, I'm intriqued how someone like you can live with yourself.'<br>
[01:08:47] You told Hammerkeg, 'well i dont worry about you, do me a favor and dont worry about me.'<br>
[01:09:32] Hammerkeg tells you, 'What concerns me is how someone without any real-life friends -equating virtual friends for real-life- can have the gaul to offend people that associate with him.'<br>
[01:10:09] You told Hammerkeg, 'hammer u just assume that i dont have any friends because that makes it easier for u to dislike me when i offend u'<br>
[01:10:16] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Some of you intellectual will have difficulty ascertaining what I'm communicating to him or her because you simply lack the aptitude.'<br>
[01:10:44] You told Hammerkeg, 'u have no real knowledge of me or my life, so u make up a lot of stuff to fit your prejudices.'<br>
[01:10:55] Hammerkeg tells you, 'No, not assume; it's highly likely.  I see you on every day, when I log on the weekends to say hello to people, your always on.'<br>
[01:11:17] Mudcrush tells the guild, 'hallo.  my name is inigo montoya.  you killed my father, prepare to die.'<br>
[01:11:21] You told Hammerkeg, 'well obviously im touched by your concern, but its misplaced.'<br>
[01:11:26] Hammerkeg tells you, 'I mean, you're always on and I know for a fact you have nothing better to do than offend and ridicule because you do not respect yourself.'<br>
[01:11:40] You told Hammerkeg, 'haha whatever you say tough guy.'<br>
[01:11:46] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Your grammar and spelling skills are so poor that it's difficult for me to respond.'<br>
[01:12:00] You told Hammerkeg, 'i cant believe that u r still sending me tells about stuff that happened like 3 months ago'<br>
[01:12:04] Hammerkeg tells you, 'No, it's very clear and obvious you do not respect yourself.'<br>
[01:12:16] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Are you kidding? -you're on every single day.'<br>
[01:12:30] You are no longer roused.<br>
[01:12:31] Hammerkeg tells you, 'And you're going to tell me people like you in real-life?'<br>
[01:12:38] Hammerkeg tells you, 'People don't like you here, let alone real-life.'<br>
[01:12:42] You told Hammerkeg, 'just play the game hammer. I dont need to justify myself to some dumb kid.'<br>
[01:13:09] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Are offending my age when I'm far more intectually aware than you are?'<br>
[01:13:26] You told hammerkeg, 'i dont understand what u just wrote.'<br>
[01:13:32] Hammerkeg tells you, 'Precisely !' - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (Precisely !)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

HAMMERKEG IS A FUCKING LOSER.  He is so damn pathetic that he can't let something die that happened 3 months ago.  He is the one with the inferiority complex and must keep trying to run others down in order to make himself feel big.  I guess he got tired of not being flamed and actually being able to get into groups again.   I guess he likes having to go to Karnor's and camp the zone because he can't get into groups anywhere else.<br>
<br>
Hammerkeg,  get a fucking life and don't worry about others.  You must be pretty lonely if you check to see if Barn is on everytime you get on.  I am sure that NO ONE cares enough about your pathetic ass to check and see if you are on when they log on,  so don't worry about others.<br>
<br>
Well,  maybe some newbie that you gave a few pp and some junk weapon to might see if you are on again in order to beg some more,  but I'm sure that's it if even that.<br>
<br>
What?  we aren't allowed to use abbreviations when we are fighting?  I guess you have time to type out every &quot;you are&quot; and everything else that is commonly abbreviated because you have no friends in the game and can't get a group outside of Karnor's.   Ever been on a Trak raid?  Ever killed a Kunark dragon?  Ever done anything other than a PoF or PoH pickup raid?  <br>
<br>
Hammer,  I stuck up for you once before,  then you flamed me on the board because you were TOO DAMN STUPID to understand that what I had written was nice.  I have kept quiet until now,  because frankly,  you don't matter to me and I could care less.  I have never checked to see if you are on line,  or even gave you a second glance if I ran past you in karnor's on my way to the basement to camp there for my VP key piece.  <br>
<br>
Barn,  he would have been on /ignore after about the 3rd tell,  or I would have petitioned him for harrasment and got his lame ass suspended hopefully.  <br>
<br>
Your 79 minute tolerance is &gt; the tolerance of about anyone else on the server (oh wait,  sorry,  hammer,  please insert &quot;greater than&quot; in place of the &quot;&gt;&quot; sorry I abbreviated ).<br>

if you were in the middle of a big raid and some bitch was bothering you, what would you do? ignore right away. imho Barnabuss feeds on flames. Go to a flame board, look at any flame, he will be there! I dont care if he has no life or looks or whatever. I just dislike when someone comes out a hero because of some other retard. Real heroes are those who are mostly silent. I'll just give you one example that comes to mind - Polonious, there is a great person. I dont know how you people dont see it, barny there is a flamemachine! Why do you bash LoS so much? whose posts are you fighting? well, there are a few names and barnabuss is one of them. I think Barnabuss you should just stop caring about all the bitching and stop bitching yourself, it will die out easy. It's like being a bigger man, like most of your guildies are.<br>
