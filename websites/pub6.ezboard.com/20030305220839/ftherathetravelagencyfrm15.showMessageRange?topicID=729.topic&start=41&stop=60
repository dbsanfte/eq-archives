Hrmm well, I don't really play jas anymore anyway. I go to raids to help out/lead anymore. Necromancers are not very group friendly till 58+ and I just have no ambitions to solo. I like grouping, I like the &quot;depending on others&quot; deal. EQ is about the people, and it did take me a while to realize that. <br>
<br>
So - hopefully I'll be strong enough to not post on this thread anymore, no matter what Drache has to say. I'll respond to Spynal though, for the simple reason is: Even though I think she's not in the right to be posting all this, she's at least mature in what she has to say. <br>
<br>
Drache, little boy - You are not the Real Drache btw. I know this because, he knew my phone number. He actually KNEW me. So i haven't stated this before, but take your immature little ass back SZ or something. k?  And next time you EBAY someone's account don't screw over their best friends! Wabbajack sends his regards.. night<br>

You could if she was wrong and hurt someone's reputation but she was RIGHT.<br>

Besides, doesn't posting your little a'sses off on these forums like some silly little 6th graders constitute a little obsessive compulsivity as well? Hmmm pot, meet kettle... you two would get along. <br>

Ever just meet someone and you know there is  more than meets the eye about them? Don't have to be an enchanter to pull a veil over someone's eyes, right JasMANna? Do you have  a girlfriend Jas? Does she know you pretend to be a female and call men &quot;hun&quot;? What would your mate think of this? Sick bitch. f'uck you and your posts, i'm not Ebay.<br>

Plzkthxbye makes me want to kick your d'ick into the dirt.<br>
<br>
I still play EQ, I might be the guy in your guild rezzing you. I might be the guy porting everyone to the raid, who am I? Remember that I can roleplay and I can be a spy anywhere...anytime. I might even be the guy in a respectable guild that hasnt done bad things to me so I keep on respecting them and being thier ally. What would make me reveal who I am? NOTHING. I'm happy now. You people don't need to know who your new friend is. Doesn't matter. I get compliments from new found guild and they are valuable to me. Makes me wonder how many more would like me if I never found out about this dreaded black hole we call RTA and got sucked into it.<br>
<br>
Not only to be there to get  things my class needs. To help others get to their goal too. To show that I know who I am, that I can be a great addition to the a nice guild. It would shock the hell  out of you if you people knew the  man  you trusted was me wouldn't it? I don't ask for anything. I don't need much help with things. I can be happy sitting around farming faction with you guys. I'm at peace now. No more rumors, no melodramatic @$$holes bugging me.<br>
<br>
People I thought were high level pricks were just judged too fast on my part. Nothing better than helping pull something for somenoe that has been drooling forever to get it's drop.<br>
<br>
OK logging  off now, i'm needed in game. See you all on here later to return flames you send at me.<br>

Did you actually think through wtf you just said, or did you just lack anything better to say so you went and ganked Nico's post? If you were referring to me with your &quot;posting on these forums is a little obsessive&quot; comment.. and then calling me a hypocrit... dude, you have more posts than me, and the fact that you're <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> posting the idea that posting is obsessive...</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
... right. wanna think about that a lil bit dude?<br>
<br>
and ok, so Spynal didn't like jas so she dug into it a little deeper. the simple fact remains that most of the so-called girls you meet in this game are still SLR's whether you want to believe that they are girls or not, so flaming jas just because he roleplays.. get this.. on a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ROLEPLAYING GAME</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.. omg, the nerve of him! <br>
<br>
Listen, before you post crap about jas being a man in real life, sit back and think of what kind of game Everquest is... RPG... if you know what that stands for, then please stfu about it and MOVE ON.<br>
<br>
you want to flame jas about her actions, etc - fine, go for it. but christ give this SLR thing a rest. and Drache.. you just seem a little TOO upset that Jas is a man. perhaps you're still a little bitter over the fact that you tried to cyber some chick toon and found out it was a guy later on, like you said so yourself? :-\<br>
<br>
whatever.. i'm not trying to defend jas, or flame spynal like it may seem.. i'm just calling it out like i see it, like the entire topic of my previous post was - IGNORE! sorry if it seemed like i was flaming you spynal.. wasnt.. just merely pointing out the fact that maybe the people that hate her so much could oh i don't know.. leave her alone maybe?<br>

It basically said &quot;I'm sorry some stupid people misunderstood me, but I really did nothing wrong.&quot;  It was a typical attempt at manipulation and totally lacking in sincerity.<br>
<br>
Also typical of a lieing manipulator to get indignant when someone points out their lies.  I feel sorry for anyone who is persuaded by reasoning such as &quot;I lied and decieved to escape the consequences of my past actions, wouldn't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally, to those who post that only someone who is perfect really has a right to make judgements about someone else's actions, how lame and hypocritical.  If I have ever gotten a speeding ticket then I have no right to condemn assault, theft or murder?  Are you saying you go through life making no judgements at all?  Or is it that those who's judgements differ from yours have no right to make a judgement? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxeddrc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xedd RC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LOM</span><br>  Posts: 551<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/17/02 12:28:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=729.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Jasmanna’s own SONOFABITCH posts…</span><hr size=1> This is what has become of Rathe flames? how sub par, if I were dead I'd be rolling in my grave but instead I'll just roll around in general. *rolls*<br>

<br>
EVERYONE judges everyone else, thats called life, deal with it.  Its how you let those personal judgements of others effect you thats important.<br>
<br>
Here is another bad anology for the pot.  <br>
<br>
I hate rap music.  Now I meet someone new who listens to rap music.  Do I a) Aviod him completely without getting to know him because I judged him based on his music or b) Allow myself to get to know him as a person despite disliking his music style?<br>
<br>
One choice is letting my mental judgement effect me, one is not.  So there ya go, its human to judge someone, its wrong to let that completely sway you.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to the topic.<br>
<br>
Jas - I dont really know what you have done wrong, besides ks a bunch of times and than lie about an alt *shrugs*<br>
<br>
But if you are really turning over a new leaf, dont worry about those who hate you for what you did before.  Let them, its their right.<br>
<br>
Just continue on the path you have decided for yourself and dont let a few people hung up on your past change that.<br>
<br>
As Nico said, just be yourself and see what happens.  If someone doesnt like you for yourself than they arent worth your enery or attention.<br>
<br>
And as for TheRealDrache, he proved sometime ago that everything he posts ever has lacked 2 things, logic and coherence.<br>
<br>
Just ignore him, pretend he doesnt exist.  He has no effect on normal people, he is just some ass trying to get everyones attention, like D!cksen JR. or something, heh.<br>

&quot;I still play EQ, I might be the guy in your guild rezzing you. I might be the guy porting everyone to the raid, who am I? Remember that I can roleplay and I can be a spy anywhere...anytime. I might even be the guy in a respectable guild that hasnt done bad things to me so I keep on respecting them and being thier ally. What would make me reveal who I am? NOTHING. I'm happy now. You people don't need to know who your new friend is. Doesn't matter. I get compliments from new found guild and they are valuable to me. Makes me wonder how many more would like me if I never found out about this dreaded black hole we call RTA and got sucked into it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hey 007, you're not as clever as you think. Odds are within 1 day of exposure to your s00per s3krit identity.. most of us would know it was the same lame tanner ass that posts here. So please, if you enjoy being the quiet Mr. Niceguy.. do that.. stop spamming the flame boards with painfully juvenile bullsh*t.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against flame posts, even bad ones... but if you're going to post 6 replies to the same thread... maybe make one of them worth our time to read? Please?<br>
<br>
But good luck on that whole secret squirrel identity where we all love and praise you for your good nature and generosity... because once you wake up from that and realize the truth.. well, maybe you won't be so at peace anymore, eh?<br>

From there on out I was just bitter to people in general.<br>
<br>
Sigh, Tur.. It's weird. Before I was just selfish, and I ignored the people I should've listened too. Now, I'm  trying to change myself for the better, and I'm listening to man yof the people I shouldn't be listening to. Honestly, I do believe RL character reflects your characteristics in game. I used to be the girl no one would mess with, i was just spiteful. Now I'm hooked on a game.. it's so sad.  Having a bad rep on the Rathe is like being the small town whore.. everyone guesses you out wherever you go.. the store, restuarants, and any events.. You're counted out before you get a chance to be counted. I know this - for simple reasons such like... being denied application to guilds for the &quot;(linked to RTA post) .. is that you?&quot; <br>
<br>
I would have to say though - LoM gave me the best chance, and although it doesn't look like i'll ever be able to join them, I've had some good times. It also helps when you're best friend is in the guild :/ .. Drache, Wabbajack sends his regards - how's his money doing btw? <br>
<br>

They really need an ignore poster command for Drache, but he'd just make another account ..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujasmannasapphireskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JasmannaSapphireskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/17/02 4:33:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=729.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hrmm</span><hr size=1> And BTW - i'm not a guy - thanks!<br>

<br>
Whereas my analogy related bad behavior to bad character and making a judgement on that your analogy merely had to do with bad taste.  Maybe your point is that since you can make an irrelevant anology all analogies are irrelevant? It's  hard to tell from your post.<br>
<br>
Given the context, this quote from you &quot;One choice is letting my mental judgement effect(sic) me, one is not.&quot; I think we can tell which way you choose.   Do you prefer to merely go with your feelings?  Perhaps you find it easier to have others make your mental judgements for you. <br>
<br>
Jasmanna, still having trouble deciding which story will get the best results?  First your a girl, then a guy, then not a guy.<br>
Given this, how are we to interpret your gratuitous remark about your girlfriend being dead?<br>
a. you are a girl who prefers girls and as part of your roleplaying claimed to be a guy.<br>
<br>
b. you are a girl who only had one friend who was also a girl<br>
<br>
c. you are a guy pretending to be a girl again<br>
<br>
d. you can't decide which line of BS will be most effective in manipulating others<br>
<br>
e.  c and d<br>

At least get something straight - What was I gonna say &quot;Anth is just some person that started playing, don't mind his 40k+ in equip or his lvl 50+ skills...&quot; I was just giving him some background to workwith.. Stop distorting it. You have NO clue what went on, but you'll take what you see here and give your demented view of what i was doing, completely irrelevant. I didn't use Anthonious to fool anyone to cheat them or to hurt them. I tried to think up a story that would well fit and it did for a while.. The friends I made on Anth i consider friends of Jas.

I sense a bit more maturity on your part. You sound more sincere in your reflections on your past anti-social behaviors.<br>
<br>
I have told you before, and I meant it then and I do so now, I am willing to give anyone another chance when they are honestly attempting to change.<br>
<br>
I don't care if you roleplay a gorilla. I do find it distasteful when people roleplay another sex and lead people on romantically. I just don't think its right to break other people's hearts, even online, just to get better gear, be treated a little nicer, etc. I am not saying YOU did this. What I saw was you still lying ...at least about what sex you are and pretending to be two different people by cross posting to your two alter egos. This made me wonder what else you might be lying to my friends about.<br>
<br>
It is good to see you start accepting responsibility for your own (past) actions. Its not easy to do. And its even harder to admit it sincerely in public. This time you didn't blame anyone else. /cheer.  <br>
<br>
Now its my turn. Perhaps I have been wrong about your willingness to change. In fact, I hope I have been wrong. No offense to you, but its like what I told you in /tell when you asked me before. Trust in people's words comes from time and future actions. I am more than willing to shut up now and give you the space you need to prove you have changed to the community and more importantly, to yourself.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you! <p><BR>
