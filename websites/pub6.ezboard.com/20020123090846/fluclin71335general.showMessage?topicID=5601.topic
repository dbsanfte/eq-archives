------------------------------------<br>
Joke 1:<br>
<br>
It was a hot day in Minnesota. Helga hung the wash out to dry, put a roast in the oven, then went downstairs to pick up some dry cleaning. "Gootness, it's hot," she mused to herself as she walked down Main street. She passed by a tavern and thought, "Vy nodt?" so she walked in and took a seat at the bar. The bartender came up and asked her what she would like to drink. "Ya know," Helga said, "it is so hot I tink I'll have myself zee cold beer." <br>
The bartender asked, "Anheuser Busch?" Helga blushed and replied "Vell fine, tanks, und how's yer pecker?"<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
Joke 2:<br>
(kinda cheesy)<br>
<br>
A very thirsty man goes into a bar. As he's sitting down, he hears the man next to him tell the bartender, "I'll have another waterloo."<br>
<br>
The bartender gives the fellow a tall, well-iced drink, then asks the newcomer what he would like to drink. Thinking the other man's drink may be a specialty of the house, he says, "I'll have a waterloo, too."                  <br>
<br>
The bartender gives him the tall, well-iced drink, and the customer takes a big drink.<br>
<br>
"Hey," he says, "this isn't any good. It tastes just like water!"<br>
<br>
The man next to him looks at the bartender and says, "Well, it is water. Right, Lou?"<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
Joke 3:<br>
<br>
On the first day of school, a teacher asked her class, "Who here is a RAIDER'S fan?"<br>
<br>
Every student knew that she loved the RAIDER'S, so they replied bye raising their hands, except for one girl, Rosie. <br>
<br>
The teacher asked, "Who do you like, little girl?" Rosie replied, "I'm a GIANTS fan and I hate the RAIDERS." <br>
<br>
The teacher asked why and Rosie told her that her parents were GIANTS fans, so she was too. The teacher said to the class, "So if Rosie's parents were idiots, what would that make her?" <br>
<br>
Rosie chimed in, "A RAIDER'S fan!!!"<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
Joke 4:<br>
<br>
Jack and Jill<br>
<br>
Jack was going to be married to Jill, so his father sat him down for a little fireside chat. He says "Jack, let me tell you something. On my wedding night in our honeymoon suite, I took off my pants and handed them to your mother, and said, 'Here - try these on.'<br>
<br>
So, she did and said, 'These are too big, I can't wear them.' So I replied, '...exactly. I wear the pants in this family and I always will.' Ever since that night we have never had any problems."<br>
<br>
"Hmmm," says Jack. He thinks that might be a good thing to try. So on, his honeymoon Jack takes off his pants and says to Jill, "Here - try these on." So, she does and says, "These are too large, they don't fit me." So Jack says, "...Exactly. I wear the pants in this family and I always will, and I don't want you to ever forget that."<br>
<br>
Then Jill takes off her pants and hands them to Jack and says, "Here, you try on mine." So he does and says, "I can't get into your pants." So Jill says,"...exactly. And if you don't change your attitude, you never will."<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
Joke 5:<br>
<br>
<br>
Two cowboys from Texas walk into a roadhouse to wash the trail dust from their throats. They stand at the bar, drinking a beer and talking about the current cow prices. <br>
<br>
Suddenly a woman at a nearby table, who is eating a sandwich, begins to cough. After a minute or so, it becomes apparent that she is in real distress. <br>
<br>
One of the cowboys looks at her and says, "Kin ya swaller?" The woman shakes her head no. <br>
<br>
"Kin ya breathe?" The woman begins to turn blue and shakes her head. <br>
<br>
The cowboy walks over to the woman, lifts up the back of her dress, yanks down her panties and slowly runs his tongue from the back of her thigh up to the small of her back. The woman is so shocked that she has a violent spasm and the obstruction flies out of her mouth. As she begins to breathe again, the cowboy walks slowly back to the bar and takes a drink from his beer. <br>
<br>
His partner says, "Ya know, I'd heard of that there Hind Lick maneuver, but I ain't never seen nobody do it before." <br>
<br>

Joke 6:<br>
"Dirty Minds"<br>
<br>
A first-grade teacher was having trouble with one of her students. The teacher asked, "Harry what is your problem?" Harry answered, "I'm too smart for the first-grade. My sister is in the third-grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the third-grade too!" <br>
<br>
The teacher had had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told the teacher he would give the boy a test and if he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first-grade and behave. The teacher agreed. Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. <br>
<br>
Principal: "What is 3 x 3?" <br>
Harry: "9". <br>
Principal: "What is 6 x 6?" <br>
Harry: "36". <br>
And so it went with every question the principal thought a third-grader should know. The principal looks at the teacher and tells her, "I think Harry can go to the third-grade." The teacher says to the principal, "Let me ask him some questions?"<br>
<br>
The principal and Harry both agree. The teacher asks, "What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?" <br>
Harry, after a moment, "Legs." <br>
Teacher: "What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?" <br>
The principal wondered: why does she ask such a question! <br>
Harry replied, "Pockets." <br>
Teacher: "What does a dog do that a man steps into?" <br>
Harry: "Pants" <br>
Teacher: What's starts with a C and ends with a T, is <br>
hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin whitish liquid? <br>
Harry: Coconut <br>
<br>
The principal's eyes open really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry was taking charge. <br>
<br>
Teacher: What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?<br>
Harry: Bubblegum <br>
Teacher: What does a man do standing up, a woman do sitting down and a dog do on three legs? <br>
<br>
The principal's eyes open really wide before he could stop the answer. <br>
Harry: Shake hands <br>
Teacher: Now I will ask some "Who am I" sort of questions, okay? <br>
Harry: Yep. <br>
Teacher: You stick your poles inside me. You tie me down to get me up. I get wet before you do. <br>
Harry: Tent <br>
Teacher: A finger goes in me. You fiddle with me when you're bored. The best man always has me first. <br>
<br>
Principal was looking restless and bit tense. <br>
<br>
Harry: Wedding Ring <br>
Teacher: I come in many sizes. When I'm not well, I drip. When you blow me, you feel good. <br>
Harry: Nose <br>
Teacher: I have a stiff shaft. My tip penetrates. I come with a quiver. <br>
Harry: Arrow <br>
Teacher: What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of excitement? <br>
Harry: Firetruck <br>
<br>
The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the <br>
teacher, "Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I missed the last ten questions myself."  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uenyk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Enyk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/14/01 9:23:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5601.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Jokes for the day: 14/Dec/2001</span><hr size=1> Not really a joke, but something to consider...<br>

 it.<br>
<br>
  Why is a Laundromat a really bad place to pick up a<br>
 woman?<br>
  Because a woman who can't even afford a washing<br>
 machine will<br>
  probably never be able to support you.<br>
<br>
  Why do women have smaller feet than men?<br>
  It's one of those &quot;evolutionary things&quot; that allows<br>
 them to stand<br>
  closer to the kitchen sink.<br>
<br>
  How do you know when a woman is about to say<br>
 something smart?<br>
  When she starts her sentence with &quot;A man once told<br>
 me.&quot;<br>
<br>
  How do you fix a woman's watch?<br>
  You don't.  There is a clock on the oven.<br>
<br>
  If your dog is barking at the back door and your<br>
 wife is yelling at<br>
  the front door, whom do you let in first?<br>
  The dog of course.  He'll be quiet once you let him<br>
 in.<br>
<br>
  I married Miss Right.  I just didn't know her first<br>
 name was<br>
 &quot;Always!&quot;<br>

  I haven't spoken to my wife for 18 months; I don't<br>
 like to interrupt<br>
 her.<br>
<br>
  Scientists have discovered a food that diminishes a<br>
 woman's sex<br>
  drive by 90%.  It's called a &quot;Wedding Cake.&quot;<br>

  Marriage is a 3-ring circus: Engagement Ring,<br>
 Wedding Ring,<br>

  Our last fight was my fault.  My wife asked me<br>
 &quot;What's on the TV?&quot;<br>
  I said, &quot;Dust!&quot;<br>

  In the beginning, God created the earth and rested.<br>
 Then God created<br>
  Man and rested.  Then God created Woman.  Since<br>
 then, neither God nor<br>

  A beggar walked up to a well-dressed woman shopping<br>
 on Rodeo Drive<br>
  and said &quot;I haven't eaten anything in four days.&quot;<br>
  She looked at him and said, &quot;God, I wish I had your<br>

  Young Son: &quot;Is this true, Dad?  I heard that in some<br>
 parts of Africa<br>
  a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her?&quot;<br>

Was that supposed to be funny?<br>
<br>
It wasnt.<br>
<br>
I find people who think its funny to kick someones ass, is funny; Because you have nothing better to do with your time..<br>
<br>
*Edit, this wasnt towards you Morty.  it was for that ebay link.    <br>
<br>
Those are interesting bashings, but since Im a guy um, they where realy not that funny.<br>
<br>
Whats funny is how people generalize a gender.<br>

Crytan, read the eBay thing again closely. The &quot;humor&quot;, as it's called by people with a sense for it, is the guy wants airfare, expenses, etc., for doing it. The two conditions are also funny.<br>
<br>
I mean, how did you even get close to thinking this guy was serious? And god forbid you actually thought it was me.<br>
