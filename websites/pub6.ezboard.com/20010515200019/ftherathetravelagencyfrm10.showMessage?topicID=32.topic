<br>
Suggesting an epic calendar to make use of items that would otherwise have gone to waste and maximize god spawn was a good and fair idea.<br>
<br>
Adding a further provision to allow the guilds from the epic calendar to get MORE shots at quest items under the guise of &quot;training&quot; is just plain greed.  There is NO demand from the server population for this so-called service.  The only thing being served here is a desire for more quest items over and above what the epic calendar would provide.<br>
<br>
The idea is resting one two false premises...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Fallacy #1</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Extra days in the calendar.  It's a fact that there are enough posting entities to NEVER, EVER have unclaimed days on the calendar.  The ONLY way to have open days is to contrive posting restrictions to force them.  I can guarantee you that for every day of the week, there is a plane capable guild ready and willing to do the plane.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Fallacy #2</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The guilds from the epic calendar are required to &quot;train&quot; anyone.  The fact is that if any guild or individual wants to learn how to do the planes they can take care of that just fine without epic guild training (read: quest-farming) sessions.  How?  The old fashioned way.  If the problem is experience, they can invite a few key people to pull/lead groups--while still staying within the calendar rules.  If the problem is size, they can form an alliance.  If the problem is that they are unguilded, they can make friends/request invites from other posting entities.<br>
<br>
If the epic guilds are that concerned about public service and making sure that nobody is left behind, there is nothing to stop them from identifying such people and inviting them on their own posted dates--within the rules of the calendar, of course.<br>
<br>
No, the only thing going on here is that they want guaranteed EXTRA quest item harvesting days.<br>
<br>
Except for this provision, it's a good proposal.  Cut the unfair dead weight and let it fly.<br>

The problem I have with the training days is this:<br>
<br>
Who sets up the calendar and decides who gets to go on training raids?<br>
<br>
I really, truly honestly think (as someone who is incapable of going to the planes without the support of another guild) that the training days are a bad idea.<br>
<br>
This discussion is part of why.  They're a lightning rod for people who want to say &quot;The uber guilds are greedy and evil and are going to screw us all.&quot;  (No offense intended to the person who brought that issue up at first, I'm just thinking about the average whineplay poster).<br>
<br>
We cant' afford to have another month of people yowling about what bastards keg/bots/ciw are and how they're monopolizing the planes.  Things are getting closer and closer to a breaking point.    Remove this one item from the calendar rules.  Go with that plan.<br>
<br>
Once we've got a plan in place and everyone happy again, we can float the idea of training day(s) again.  <br>
<br>
Ok, I'll shut my mouth now.<br>

Something needs to be done fast, but dont drop the training days. Maybe reduce it to one a month, but dont drop them. This idea of training days is the best public relations tool that you have. If guild leaders are worried that it is only giving the epic guilds another shot in the planes, then smooth it out on the boards later. As Bias said, things are close to a breaking point here. Concede this one point to the board, and move on. I will not benefit personally from this training day, but I think it is a great idea. Many people out there think that the epic guilds are only out for themselves. This idea of Training days will either prove them right or wrong. If they use the day for farming, then they are only hurting themselves. I truly dont think that will happen. If it means that some of us might get cut out of a plane for an extra 10-20 days, so be it. I would rather have to get a bump in the schedule for a training day, then have to constantly fight for a spot in a FFA environment. As long as there is a &quot;fair&quot; rotation in bumps. (If there are even a need for bumps) If the days are put in, and the indys and smaller guilds get a chance at the planes with help from more experienced players, then you will win over even more of the masses that are screaming and yelling right now. So what if it means that the epic guilds get another crack at an epic mob. That just means that they will get all the epic drops they need faster. They will have PLENTY of opportunities for the drops from other alliances that are unable to take down the epic mobs. Has anyone thought of this.... What say we put this proposal in action. The epic guilds get the epic drops, 3 months from now they have all the drops they need. Maybe then you can ask them to help you get an epic drop?...who knows. The more we work together on this, the better it will all be. Lets put this into action and see what happens.<br>

<br>
Which independents &amp; small guilds get to go?  Who makes the list?  who decides?<br>
<br>
It will turn into another opportunity to bash the &quot;Uber Guilds who run our server&quot; (tm Whineplay).<br>
<br>
I think it's a great idea if the calendar was stable and the atmosphere wasn't so hostile.<br>
<br>
With what we're faced with right now as a community, I think the best plan is to drop that for now, and bring it up in a few months once the calendar has stabilized and we've rooted out or ostracized losers like Grimmjack &amp; Co.<br>

That's exactly my point.  The regular calendar + the epic calendar provide plenty of opportunity and training days are completely unnecessary.<br>
<br>
I would ask this...  name one, just one thing that is accomplished by training days that is of benefit to the server at large and isn't possible without training days.<br>
<br>
Let's see...  public relations or any particular guild?  Fail.  A guild's PR is its own business and can be handled through other means.<br>
<br>
Opportunities for indies and small guilds?  Fail.  This is of benefit to the server at large but can be accomplished through alliances and invites.  Plane experienced guilds can invite people to train them and small guilds/indies can <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> form their own posting entities</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and invite advisors/leaders to help them.  To expand on that point just a bit...  there is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> nothing rare or special</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> about being able to clear fear/hate.  Basically <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> any</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> current poster could work with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> any</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> indy/small guild to get them up to speed.  There is nothing about fear/hate clearing that requires a guild from the epic calendar.<br>
<br>
Opportunities--over and above the epic calendar--for more quest items for the epic guilds?  Fail.  This benefits the epic guilds but provides exactly zero benefit towards sharing planes time fairly amongst the server as a whole.<br>

The training days are done with the best of intentions, but all of the 'uber guilds' must now accept that every action you take, no matter how well intended, is going to be scrutinized for how your guilds are getting the edge, or the extra benefit.<br>
<br>
This is the ONLY point that is causing everyone on the boards to not get behind the proposal.  I can almost guarantee that if/when this hits whineplay or other boards, the vitriol will center on this, and not on the good things about the calendar.<br>
<br>
It's stupid and it's lame, but if we really want a calendaring system, we're going to have to forego some things that would be REALLY COOL in favor of things that will make people trust the calendaring system again and actually abide by it.<br>
