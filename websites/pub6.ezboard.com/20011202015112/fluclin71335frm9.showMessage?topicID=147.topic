everything is random. As far as i know, there is no special unique loot. Everything is determined by quality level. Basically all weapons and armor are the same, only difference is quality level. An EQ player might find that aspect of the game bland. All randomly generated dungeons, no static spawns; sometimes i miss what sebilis and karnor had to offer. This game won't offer the great feeling when a monk a Tranquil Staff drops off a mob or when you get that uber belt you wanted for 40 levels. Good thing about this game is that it did pull me away from EQ. I played AO for about a month and canceled my account. AO actually helped me kick my EQ habit. <p><b>Homeless monk of Norrath </b>

EQ is a better game overall, mainly due to the numerous major bugs AO suffers.<br>
<br>
Customer service sucks for both games though, but when you only pay 10-12 bucks per month you can't expect a representative to answer your complaints 24/7.<br>
<br>
Honestly I'm just waiting for NWN, then AO will get dumped like EQ.<br>

The only thing they have in common are they are both MMORPGs.  Otherwise they are very different...<br>
<br>
Like what they've said before.<br>
<br>
Graphics/sound/visuals are much better in AO<br>
<br>
UI now that I've switched I actually prefer AOs to EQ.  Matter a fact.  After playing AO for a month or so and not playing EQ at all.  I'm having a tough time getting the swing of EQ.  Then again I've not really tried.  I've only logged in to say hello to some people whom I've not talked to for a long while.<br>
<br>
Actually I shouldn't be doing such a break down since its easier to ramble on and say things since each game has things that can't be compaired. Like:<br>
<br>
Mission booths in AO, I like the idea.  It does get boring.  But, if you need some quick cash or some easy experience its a great way to go.  Run up, get 3 in the same area and complete them.  Usually gaining a level and pocketing a bunch of cash.  It doesn't require more then yourself either.  But if you want you can increase the difficulty and have a friend or friends come with.<br>
<br>
There are static dungeons.  I've never seen them, but I'm sure they fail to compare to EQ's.  Since EQ obviously theres loot that you expect to fall from specific mobs.  Most everything in AO is just randomly generated based on your level.<br>
<br>
Classes, everyone is about the same.  Unlike EQ where each class has its nack, and really needs to function as a team, you really don't have that in AO.  Sure theres a few that are a little better at soloing, but its not impossible for the rest.<br>
<br>
Shops, I actually like AO's shops better.  You can actually buy usefull stuff.  So you have somewhere to spend your credits.<br>
Which leads me to EQ's economy, there really isn't one in AO.  Sure they have a shopping channel that you can sell your wares, but if you hold out long enough you'll find stuff in your missions.<br>
<br>
There are tons of items that you can loot, for the most part they are just higher quality of older stuff that you've seen.  But that being said.   Theres still a ton of stuff you can find/buy.<br>
<br>
The huge problems I see with AO, are the exploiters.  I know EQ when it was starting out had the same problem.  I know the next generation games will have the same problem.  But it doesn't see like funcom wants to do anything about it...  They say they are.  But I don't see it.  Rumor has it theres some characters close to 200 (the highest level)  I wonder how many EQ chars got to 50 when the game first came out within the first few months?<br>
<br>
The lag, which has greatly improved.  But still can cause problems.  Like trying to zone while getting attacked.  Sometimes you just can't zone.  And will die.  They did correct this last patch so it helped out a lot, but it does still happen.  Whats even more painful is running through a zone and agroing on something that you didn't see because they've toned down the distance.<br>
<br>
They've come a long way.  But in my eyes theres still more that needs to be fixed.   This big patch that they applied today maybe another big step.  Last time I checked though, they had to bring the servers down due to the patch.<br>
<br>
Their customer service is really bad.  And up until a week or so were very tight lipped about info on their message boards.  Almost seemed like they crindge at the though of having to say anything, because everyone is out to get them.  Especially when something is broken.  Take Luclins F&amp;R X 10.<br>
<br>
Would I recommend AO?  Sure, you do need a pretty beefy machine to make it work to what I consider, respectfull performance.  If you don't mind playing by yourself, unless you go out of your way to meet up with a friend online.  I don't think you'll meet as many people in AO as you would in EQ thats for sure.  Theres one thing to be said about server message boards like Luclin.  Much more of a community feel, unlike AO's main message board which looks like a bitch fest.<br>
If your one that doesn't have as much time to play EQ or your burt out of EQ I would give it a shot.<br>
<br>
Am I long term with AO?  Doubt it...<br>
<br>
Will I go back to EQ? and play more often (then logging on and using it as a irc client for 20 minutes)? Who knows...<br>
<br>
Lastly its hard to compare a new product thats only been out for a few months.  And EQ where it's been around for years... Its not fair for either..   Of course theres going to be more bugs with AO, and of course EQs graphics aren't going to be as good.<br>

<br>
If you are a casual gamer and don't mind pretty much playing alone, then AO wins hands down.  You can play for an hour or two and accomplish quite a bit, probably even gaining a level in that time.  But players aren't nearly as social, since there is no real camping, static spawns or downtime. Everyone is scurrying around doing things and so converstaion between players is minimal.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for a more social atmosphere with less activity overall than EQ is great. Given the amount of time people sit around while camping a spawn, it is much easier to chat and such. Items are more varied and the static dungeons have a different themes that make them interesting to visit.<br>
<br>
I have actually recently returned to playing EQ. I missed the social interaction of EQ.<br>
<br>
My personal opinion, AO is cool, but in the end it is an &quot;play until something better comes along&quot; type of game. Right now it seems to lack a certain depth and unless it gets some soon, I think people will tire of it. Maybe when they start the storyline it will help.<br>
<br>
Just me 2 creds. <p><BR>

We'll see where it is in 6 months.  I assume you'll see a lot of new faces.  But I think you'll not see a lot of the old faces around. <br>

In AO the dungeons dont have the unique feel and aren't as intresting BUT there is ZERO downtime if you want it that way. Also you can feel a constant progression with your character because it doesn't take weeks to level. Traveling is instant, whompa/grid &gt; buggy boats.<br>
<br>
I also think the skill/implants/nano systems in AO are more intresting then the leveling in EQ. You can literally shape your character everyday by tweaking it here and there.<br>

  I have been playing AO since it came out. Here is my cheers, jeers and thoughts...  bear with me, this is gonna be long <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  AO does look good, tho populated area get very bad. It isn't conenction lag, it's your computer having to think too much. It's not the graphics that bog your machine down, it's really the people. I can go out to the middle of a huge zone with my group and hunt there, put the clipping plane to Max and not see any reduction in the FPS, but god forbid another group comes by: you will be in HD swapping hell for a long time. The problem is that reducing the visual clip plane and even the 'person' clip plane too much ruins play: you might miss a mob that is actualyl too close and attacks at the worst possible time, or you got the visual clip plane so far down, and you can't see anything but cloud and sky textures. *PS: god forbid a storm to roll in. I will say that this problem has been greatly fixed, and that even the most impatient person can easily deal with it. Playing with the in-game options can make AO run very reasonable in almost any situation, I do consider that machine lag issue solved greatly solved.<br>
<br>
Customer service is unexcusable: I would rather have the rude, uncaring bastard of a GM in EQ to reply to my /petition than none at all... and yes, I do mean NO REPLY. I have personally been totally neglected for my pleas of help from both in-game and e-mail customer service... on repeated occasions. These were not me ranting, these were REAL problems; like loosing a very important item (your apaerment key: you can store stuff in there), or being stuck behind an invisible wall behind the 'end' of a zone, unable to zone. I will say that e-mail help was helpful; if you consider a form letter that does not state your plea problem and points you to there tech web page help. *This jeer, I feel, is a game ending flaw for me. It needs to be dealt with now.<br>
<br>
Professions overlap alot. From what I can gather, Doctors and maybe Agents are the unique proffession in the game. Everyone else are just proffessions that have the Nanos you wanna use. Docs heal, no matter what MMORPG you play, healers will ALWAYS be needed and loved and fought over. Agents have Nanos that can change there profession temporarily, though it sacks your skills and abilities as that profession. Even then, that is a huge advatage, simply in the fact that a sole agent can use the really good buffs of the other professions to buff themselves.. no begging and pleading. I have seen agents false prof into docs for secondary healing in the group, and I must say, it works very well. And of course, Agents are best at Aimed Shot. Having the ability to half a mobs life before it gets to the group is pretty valuable. To make a group in AO, you need a Doc, plus some sort of tank (aka soemone with alot of life), then others. This is a good thing! I have always felt that to have a succesful group in EQ (expesially at very high EQ levels), that you have to follow a far more constritive formula. Cleric, Warrior (if not 2 or more), Chanter, Shaman  then others. Lets say that you have one warrior to tank, that leave only 2 spots for everyone else.<br>
<br>
AO is lacking in the high level/extented play area. As of now, I am a 65 Agent, how I play has NOT changed since I came out of the n00b area. Mission for items and cash, group for XP. Get tired of one, do the other. No quests, no mobs/zones to raid. Nothing to plan for the future but kill that lvl 200 Leet roaming some zone and geting nothing but monster parts and a maybe random useless normal item. I pray to whatever God/Godess will listen that this will change with that 4 Year story. *I know nothing about it, can someone infor me a bit?<br>
<br>
PvP is a joke; though I have never been a fan of PvP to begin with. The reason I say it's a joke is because there is no middle ground in it. AKA dueling, there is no means of jsut one-on-one without gonig through a huge hassle. I tried everyday for a week, 4+ hours a day trying to get a 1-on-1 duel. Everytime I got a reply to some who will duel, either I or my opponent gets ambushed by others waiting. That sort of FFA PvP has no appeal to me. Good point of AO is that the PvP aspect of the game can be completely ignored if you don't want to deal with it. I have done MANY misison in PvP areas and never came across someone itching to kill me.<br>
<br>
I enjoy playing an Agent alot, the persona is very appealing to me, that is why I am still there. Second, I want to see how Funcom plans on making the game better and how they will add/change it. Basically, I feel the game is still being made, (for the most part), and I see that making the decision to ditch it as being premature. I feel that the bugginess and flaws that I dealt with in the past will produce an excellent MMORPG. Once I can see how the game will be, then I will deside: EQ? AO? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.showMessage?topicID=154.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.showMessage?topicID=156.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.emailToFriend?topicID=147.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.threadControl?topicID=147.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=147.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=147.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Anarchy Online<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...<option value="luclin71335frm25">Other Games (condensed)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm9>Anarchy Online</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.luclin.com">Luclin.com</a></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
