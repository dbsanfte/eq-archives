<br>
oh, but that just wouldn't be the same.  why?  cuz the majority of people use these boards, and won't change.  and they do that because for the most part we all like *this* msg board and the way it is run.  hehe yeah, i guess i can't speak for everyone, so i should take the &quot;we&quot; out of this post, but if everyone was so unhappy with the &quot;hitler nazi&quot; whatever way this board is run, then someone would have made a new msg board by now, and it would have been successful, and taken all the folks away from here.<br>
<br>
but, when an anon-flamer makes some kinda big huge :insult everyone&quot; post about how much this board sux, then mr anon-flamer usually manages to get at least a certain amount of attention, which is most likely all they wanted in the beginning.  that may actually be the true purpose behind why the F&amp;R board is so popular, a buncha egos get to clash and all fight over who's the loudest and the &quot;mostest smartest&quot;, and they get to do it all in the safety of their computer room, without anyone ever actually getting in their RL face.  but heck, is that so bad?  we all need to get out our agressions someway, but it's a heck of alot more fun when you have an audience, but also a heck of alot more risky.  but then we have the F&amp;R.<br>
<br>
so if we all made our own F&amp;R with our own rules, we'd all be bitching to ourselves, and that would be no fun at all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
i think i had a point, but i lost it somewhere while i was letting off steam, but hey thats ok, i guess.<br>

Well honestly I like Bic...but I can't say I completely disagree with senior anon flamer...I mean if yer gonna flame you shouldn't have to hold back.  On the other hand, racial slurs, well i just think that's really b.ullshit...and there's the problem, everyone is gonna feel strongly about something, but who knows, maybe this crack head has a point.<br>

I'll be back to my normal posting and moderating daily self after jan 12th though...<br>
<br>
To defend: They're not my rules. I didn't put myself in this position. I never asked for this position. Why do I do it? People of the board suggested it, Mily gave me the status to help her because she and the other people trusted me to pick up the slack since the other mod, Aenae, had disappeared. Luclin and these boards are priceless to me, and no one or two morons are going to ruin them... especially anon morons. I follow the rules that are written for the board, and I also try to do what is best for the community as a whole. This is no power trip, there are no personal vendetas on my behalf, I'm not out to be an arse... I'm merely out to keep a mode of communication between the people who play on the server that I've grown to love so much clean, safe, and the best that it can be. I don't get paid, I get no benefits, I get little thanks... I don't ask for pay, I don't ask for benefits, I don't ask for thanks... I won't accept pay or benefits for this, but the occasional thanks I get motivates me to do this for as long as is needed. As long as I know I'm helping to give back in some way, I'll keep doing this the best I can, and no anon flamer will stop me, nor will they make me change.<br>
<br>
But I thank you for your spunk and arguement Mr. Anon_Flamer_06<br>
<br>
I'm no power gamer, I have no uber twinks, I'm not in an uber guild, I don't e-bay, I don't sit in the EC tunnel, I don't have any grand ambitions for the game, this is the only server I've ever played on. I'm a simple guy, I like my wizard, and I'm thankful for all the people I've met along the way... although I'm not &quot;uber&quot; in any sense of the term, and I don't have over 75 days played on all my characters combined, I get a lot of pleasure out of this experience we call EQ, mostly in the people I've met who've been so kind as to share their time with me... and I'll be damed if I'll let them down by letting this messageboard be a rotting pool of crap where people's personal information is compromised and where the decent folk have to worry about what they or their children might see when they come here... and above all, I'll be damned if I'll have anon posters bastardizing the board and spamming it to all hell and causing long time members of this community who are in good standing to use this less often or leave entirely. <p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=400>

But heres what i gotta say anon_moron_32,954<br>
<br>
There is a good reason that there are rules on these forums, and its not like Bic decided out of the blue what they were gonna be, they were mostly put in place by the people who use the boards, and tradition in the posts here.<br>
<br>
Want free speech ?<br>

Make your own ezboard you god damn n00b and get the @#%$ outta here.<br>

That is funny... gotta give credit where credit is due. But in reality, I think only about 4 people in my guild at the very most have even seen any of the mobs that have to be killed to obtain the wizard epic, so yes, the fact that I'm holding an epic was credit to the help of many other guilds and individuals. A few LoS folks helped me ensure that the enraged golem went down, and Dethiel sent me a tell out of the blue one day when I was on one of Anng and VL's raids in Kael that they were going to down VS, and if I wanted to come I was welcome to... but if that's a &quot;benefit&quot; of being a board moderator, errr, then I'm Antonius Bayle.<br>
<br>
Btw, where is that anon poster who was always like, &quot;WTB moderator with epic??&quot;... you weren't him, were you? I cannot remember, there have been so many anon posters I'm having trouble telling them apart. <p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=400>

If people have helped him, maaaaaaaybe its because they *gasp* like him?! I dont talk to him in-game, but I consider Bic a friend, and would help him if he asked for it at the drop of a hat.<br>
