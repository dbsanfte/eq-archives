<br>
I dont want that. 98% of the people reading this will not want that.<br>
<br>
You want your day? keep on working with people to change the rules and make an independant day.  Otherwise, dont come here opening the flood gates and not expect people to be pissed.  We have worked too hard on this to go back to all that crap.<br>
<br>
PS.  Why haven't you even tried forming an alliance?  It seems that your guild and Sheltim's (sp?) guild has the number of people required to become a posting entity.  He is even interested in talking to you about it.  Give it a try!</font><P>Sultar McWeiser<br>

We respect your position, please respect ours.<br>
<br>
In the last week we have gone from organizing an independent raid which would have potentially infringed on a previously scheduled raid, to a decision to do our best to accomodate the calendar Admins.  We have gone through much consternation (on both sides) up to and including flames dredging up alleged wrongs from many months ago.  All of this however, has had one overriding theme ... &quot;We have OUR rules.  Unless you (The Band) acceed to them, we will NOT accomodate you under any circumstances.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, Sultar, while you do not agree with / understand our point of view I would hope that you can at least respect it.  We have been willing to capitulate to every point but one ... the arbitrary, unique list of 40.  For you this is a point of the rules being followed.  For us, it is an issue of both privacy and authority.<br>
<br>
I don't want to spend a lot of time rehashing the same arguements.  Hopefully, we can all proceed with a minimum of contention.<br>

<br>
We are going to the planes on the 4th of January, 2001.<br>
<br>
If the non-sanctioned (By Verant) calandar deems that they have &quot;Control&quot; over the zone, so be it.  I am posting asking the same respect of the calandar people that they ask of each other, to respect my day in the planes.  I'm not asking for posting rights, that will or will not happen as time allows.<br>
<br>
The Band of the Black Hand will be hosting a fear raid on the 4th, I do hope we aren't in conflict with another guild who decides to &quot;reserve&quot; the plane after I have already picked a free day, but if they do, I'm sure the rules of conduct that Verant has forced upon us will resolve the issue in one way or another.<br>

<br>
Hi, i just recently quit my guild, and formed a guild called &quot;Clan of the Sultarian Order.&quot;  We dont have 40 planable people (in fact, we have 1), but we have as much right as Band of the Black Hand to post.  If they can reserve it, so can we.<br>
_________________<br>
<br>
See where I am going with this? Soon enough we will have 20 people doing what you just did.<br>
<br>
Im not trying to bash you man.  IMHO, you deserve a day like the rest of us. Heck, even Xenth does.  In the &quot;independant raid&quot; thread most people are agreeing that there should be an indy day.  But you preffer to state that you dont care about working with the rest of the server, and that you will now have the plane date one way or the other.  The mentality in which you are approaching this is totally wrong, man.  We didn't work so hard so that i could start a guild called CotSO, go whenever the hell i wanted, and have it recognized by the calendar.<br>
<br>
All Im saying is to try to work with the people bro.  Yeah, yeah. I understand your position.  You want your day! Heck, I AGREE!  But this dual posting place wont stick, cause you are not the only guild that wants to go up there that preffers to go with their 18 people rather than to form an alliance.  If you preffer to remain an independant entity on the calendar and have an independant day, i am with you, and i will support the agreement that EVERYONE in the server comes up with so that these rules include the smaller guilds that do NOT want an alliance.<br>
<br>
I know you are tired of having to deal with the rest of the server to get your day in the plane, but just like you have had 5 days of negociations, 60% of the plannable people had 3 months of negociations with the uber guilds to come up with what we have now.  3 months, man.  To hear now that from the very first day Deus Factum could have said &quot;i will take this date and i expect it to be recognized&quot; really burns.  This is a better system than that.  Either abide by it or change it.  Its not set on stone. Just need to put your effort in there.</font><P>Sultar McWeiser<br>

<br>
And for 5 days I get one of two answers.<br>
<br>
First:<br>
&quot;Sorry, it's the way we 'all' want it, so your not important enough to be part of the 'all' I suggest you go make friends with people just so you can use them to get phat lewt and have access to part of a game you pay the same amount as us for&quot;<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
&quot;Wow man, that like, sucks man.  I see what your saying man.  I think we should do something man...&quot; *Notices BB walk in* &quot;No, it's the way we 'all' want it, so your not important enough to be part of the 'all' I suggest you go make friends with people just...&quot; *Notices BB walk away* &quot;Like I was saying man, That sucks... We'll work something out man...&quot;<br>
<br>
Color me how you will, we TRY to work things out, but get the same answer over and over.  A wise man once said, &quot;Beating your head against a wall may only bloody the wall.  And blood will not soften the stone, unless it is from those who keep the wall.&quot;<br>
<br>
I state again for the reading impaired: Band of the Black Hand will be in Fear on the 4th of January, 2001.  Please respect this, for we will respect your reservations in return.<br>

<br>
Use your own judgment, and do what you think you must if you refuse to work within this system as it exist currently.  You clearly have decided that you should be subject to some rules but not to others, despite the fact that everyone else that is able to post a calendar date has chosen to abide by those same rules.<br>
<br>
If a posting entity shows up on that date and it is their name in the calendar, I will consider you to be the one in violation, not them.  They took all the necessary steps, they respect the calendar system.  They are the ones who I will think are getting maltreated, and not you.<br>
<br>
So do what you will.  But all actions have consequences.<br>

<br>
Who determins legitimate? Definitly not you.  I have as &quot;legitimate&quot; a right to plan a trip to the plane as anyone else in the game, deny me this right and I'll take it to Verants inferior rules.<br>
<br>
I am TRYING to work within the system, however the system is flawed, and while some seem willing to work to make it less flawed, they obviously fear the repercussions of &quot;Big Brother&quot; saying fuck you all and taking over the planes.<br>
<br>
I fear no one.  I will try to work with this system, I'm takin a single date, respect it if you wish, dont if you dont want to.  But keep in mind, I will be in the zone that day, and if you choose to not respect our time in the game, we will play by Verants Rules.  And I dont think anyone really wants that now do you.<br>

<br>
I do feel your anger, but then again I do also understand when they won't give you a password.<br>
I would say about 90% of the guilds on the Rathe are satisfied of the rules at the moment. It is very hard then for the people who put down alot of time and effort on these boards to listen to the rest 10% (even if that would be the right thing to do...)<br>
We all try to make this work and I believe you can do your part aswell.. Not by zoning in to fear the 4th jan without &quot;permission&quot;, but by zoning in with allies and friends. <br>
Why don't you want an allied guild fighting on your side? Are you afraid of that your guildmembers won't get the drop they want? <br>
Please don't misunderstand me here, I am not trying to be rude and I'm not saying that you are wrong, cus you are not. You have the much right as anyone playing this game, to zone into fear, but do you really want to destroy something so many people have built, just because it don't fit your needs?<br>
<br>
I have great respect for your guild Zanthor, I believe there is alot of people/guilds that share the same opinion as me, but please show us the same respect and solve this issue in another way..<br>
<br>
We sure don't want FFA in the planes.. it will only benefit the bigger guilds, and this fear raid will mostly be your last if you do it your way 8(<br>
<br>
Good luck to you Zanthor and your guild. I really hope you get your date</font><P><font color=#345618>

About a year ago we were one of the largest(not the but one of the) Guilds on the Rathe. We had a civil war of sorts. We begot 2 guilds since then one of wich burned , another wich is well known and have thier own trials and fires to deal with. We knew of the calendar, we even agreed with it. At a time we didnt have sufficient experience or members to post. We didnt believe we could do the Planes alone , so we worked hard , I in particular have worked VERY hard. our Roster has grown over time, with Quality people. We now have a roster of over 60 with about 40 being full time active. We finally felt confident enought to get up in the planes and rock house. <br>
<br>
So we post to the Calendar we get our password and posting rights. We are happy all our hard work has been fruitful. 2 weeks to the day we recieve notice your posting access has been removed until you can sufficiently show you have what we want to enter the planes per our NEW REVISED rules.<br>
<br>
We never even had a chance to post our raids.<br>
<br>
This is the Frustrations we see, and feel currently.<br>
<br>
Your own policies say that these are VOLUNTARY rules and NOONE has to follow them that it is a simple agreement.<br>
<br>
Well we have not been allowed into the Agreement. <br>
<br>
WE have the right to go to the planes with any amount of people/friends/allies/associates as we feel. No one can tell me otherwise. The calendar is to prevent people overlapping in the planes NOT to make sure that loot is out right, and that the larger guilds can get all the epic things, or that other guilds are not going with too many people. <br>
<br>
If thats what it is then you are declareing some sort of authority, and are becomeing a Policeing agency. Wich is not sanctioned by me Or verant. <br>
<br>
On Jan 4 2001, BOTBH will enter the planes we gave the Calendar their respect in chooseing a day that is not taken up so as not to cause undue heart Ache.<br>
<br>
This is our good faith, we had rash decisions and inflamed posts because of our initial outrage. We talked. we listened, we negotiated. with the same results being told &quot;You cant go to the planes&quot;<br>
<br>
Well we are. We are respection your community , so respect ours.<br>

I just wish you to solve this problem so it benefits us &quot;all&quot;, and you can do it.<br>
You have fought for your rights in a long time now and I really have sympathy for your concern...<br>
But take a look at the consequences if you do this raid without &quot;permission&quot;. <br>
Alot of anger from other guilds will hunt your door, and maybe in some cases some guilds is going to destroy your plans (not me nor my guild)..<br>
I can't tell I wouldn't do the same really, because you fights for your rights, and there is nothing wrong with that, rather respectful...<br>
But this time you CAN solve this in a harmless way which fit &quot;everyone&quot; and my suggestion is that you do so<br>
<br>
Whatever you choice to do, I will still respect you but I can assure you that this isn't going to be an majority opinion.<br>
I'm not trying to threaten you now, just trying to help you see some realistic future treatment..<br>
Please reconsider this and work something out  </font><P><font color=#345618>

<br>
Well, we have thought about that, but we happen to be picky about who's names we put next to ours, for our actions reflect them, and theirs reflect us...<br>
<br>
We have many friends in EQ, many of them are in other guilds, other organizations, other alliances.<br>
<br>
So because we choose to not to blindly forge alliances strictly for a number 40 to get posting access, we are denied.<br>
<br>
Say it's the phat lewt if you want, but I guarantee that my guild has some of the most honorable and non-greed driven people in the game as our members.  We play the game to enjoy it, and part of that will be doing the planes, a new challenge for us to overcome.<br>
<br>
All guilds of our size have come to this point, and all who are smaller will reach this point sometime.<br>

That is totally correct.  You could walk in today into Fear, invoke PnP on whatever guild you want (actually, my guild is in fear today, eeeeep), and take the plane and make us leave.  You can enjoy your plane, and get all the loot you want. Now, dont expect us to be happy people, and dont expect us to group with you anywhere else, and dont expect us to ress you when you were trained somewhere.  Also, be sure that we will post it here so that everyone knows what you did, and they will ignore you like we will.<br>
<br>
Its just a matter of reputation.  Yes, you can do whatever you want, however be prepared to be blacklisted by the server.  I am not going to say that i will train you, because i will not.  However, i will completely ignore anyone that carries your guild's name from that point on.  And when 75% of the server (or higher) ignores you, you will know why you should have gone another route with your actions.<br>
<br>
That's the way this server does justice. Xenth is an example.  Are the rules screwed up now because they neither include you nor help you?  Yes, that might be right.  However this is not the answer.  As i see it, you have 2 options, im gonna say them again: Either abide by the rules or change them.</font><P>Sultar McWeiser<br>

<br>
We have bent over backwards explaining things to you, and how you can do things your way and still stay within the rules but you chose not to. Get another group and split the days. It's that simple. You said you want a smaller calendar for smaller guilds to go less often. This is the same thing. This is the option available to you. Why you feel you have to go outside of rules to do the same thing is beyond me.<br>

People can argue and twist words until they get blue in the face but there aren't many ways to go about the Calendar.<br>
<br>
Either you :<br>
<br>
1. Abide by the calendar, which means ALL it's rules without exceptions.<br>
Wether you be Zabthor, Edwina, Elaundar or Bradan doesn't matter, if u want in the calendar you respect it's rules.<br>
<br>
If you can't understand even that basic concept, you have no point interracting with people.<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean that once you have worked with and in the Calendar you cannot change things you see as not working.<br>
<br>
Or <br>
<br>
2. You say Screw the calendar and go FFA.<br>
Wether it be all the rules or just ONE rule that you disapprove it's the same, if u aren't part of it yet, if u haven't worked with it yet and you don't want its rules your are against it. <br>
<br>
<br>
As far as i am concerned 4th of January Zanthor as declared it FFA since he is against the calendar.<br>
<br>
So my choices for that day would be :<br>
<br>
1. If i am in a guild or with friends maybe go up there and have fun with trains, deaths, farming and so on.<br>
<br>
2. Be a Vindictive bastard and petition Alkiron to disband Band of Black Hand for crashing another's guild/alliance raid.<br>
<br>
3. If Alkiron doesn't disband Band of Black Hand, petition him for his lack of objectivity and evenness. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I have been reading and following the Band of the Black Hand and their struggle to get a planes password etc etc. and would just like to state how this situation was similar to my guild.<br>
<br>
Basically, we were in the same boat Zanthor. BOTB had only 18 planable people....what were we to do? Firmly believing that the calendar system brings order to what would otherwise be complete chaos.... <br>
<br>
*imagine 200 people in fear...people using /lfg etc.. zone crashing half the time because it can't hold the amount of people..... etc etc*<br>
<br>
... we formed an alliance with the Legends of Marr, bringing our number of planable people above the required 40. I don't really see what all the fuss is about. Yes I agree you should have the right to do this and that, just the same as any other, but I also believe that the calendar system was made with the intent of the greater good for everyone, and not just for the &quot;uber&quot; guilds. It gives everyone a fair shot to reserve dates, just takes a lil work on the smaller guilds part with forming an alliance. Thats all, just the point of view of another guildleader who was in the same situation.<br>
