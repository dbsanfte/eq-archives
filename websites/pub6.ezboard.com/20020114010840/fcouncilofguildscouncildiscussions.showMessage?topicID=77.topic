For now I'm sticking this in the General Discussion forum while I look at this whole thing and responses before implementing any of them.<br>
<br>
1.  48 people.  No more.  Period.  If we need more of a certain class, then someone gets bumped.  Bumped people get first preference on the next plane raid.<br>
<br>
2.  Sign up page.  Only those who have signed up will go.  If you dont sign up, you dont go.  The only exceptions to this would be if we need your class.<br>
<br>
3.  You have to sign yourself up on the signup page.<br>
<br>
4.  You must acknowlage in your signup that you have read all the rules and will abide by them.  And that you understand the penalties that will be imposed for breaking them.<br>
<br>
5.  You will listen to the raid leader and those whom he appoints as other leaders.<br>
<br>
6.  Shout is only for the leadership team.  No exceptions.<br>
<br>
7.  Failure for any reason to abide by the rules set out will result in your being asked to leave and your guild leader/officers being informed of this.  Multiple offenses will result in being permanently banned from my raids.<br>
<br>
8.  loot table system may be implemented in order to encourage people to come to raids that do not involve something they can immediatly get.<br>
<br>
9.  More stuff to be added as necessary.<br>
<br>
Hmmm...I dont know.  When I look at this, I think where the hell is there room for fun?  When did I become a kindergarden teacher?  And lets not forget the normal, this sucks.<br>
<br>
I dont want to implement any of the above.  Not a single one.  Most of this is what many other guilds and alliances do and frankly it goes against much of what I see CoG as.  And yet what choice is there?  Over the last year CoG plane raids have become more and more chaotic.  Some people may be able to deal with that, however, I am not one of them.  I dont have anyone else to hand this off to, I dont have raid seconds who can take a lot of the load off me.  I need people to listen to me the first time.  Do I need to implement rules like the above to get that?  <br>
<br>
Well, I leave it up to those of you who attend these events.  Please prove that we can continue to run these raids with a minimum of rules.  Show us that we are not endangering everyone by allowing walk ons.  Show us you will listen.  Show that you care about more than just your loot.<br>

They do NOT go against the CoG principles at all. 8 is something I've always fought against myself. <br>
<br>
But 1-7... as an experienced raid commander myself, you can be as free and open as you want, but if you don't get 1-7 right, the raid just sucks for you. Period. And there is no reason for that. <br>
<br>
There is no reason to expect that those raiders can't do 1-7. The raiders are asking a LOT of the raid commander and management team. They are asking to be given an experience that BEFORE the CoG started doing them, NO ONE was offering... a chance to do dragons, planes and other large targets, without having to be in a specific guild or type of guild. And they are asking that this experience be given to them on a platter. <br>
<br>
You as a raid commander are giving up a LOT... time, stress, research, organization are all part and parcel of a successful raid commander's job. The VERY least you can ask of your raiders is that they 1) sign up, 2) show up on time, 3) listen to your directions, 4) don't complain and basically contribute to the success of the raid. You as a raider are being GIVEN a great deal, whether you realize it or not, and you have the responsibility to at the very least do 1-7. Asking someone to sign up for an event is NOT against CoG principles. Limiting the numbers to an amount you can handle is NOT against CoG principles. The CoG philosophies don't say you should have to take shit and endanger the success of the event just to let people in on the raid. <br>
<br>
The CoG philosophy is about the residents of Karana, whether guilded or not, taking the responsibility for the entertainment, value and good of the Karana community. It's about providing events that are successful and fun to the community at large. Disrupting a CoG raid is NO DIFFERENT than disrupting a CoG tournament. It's something I struggled with myself as raid commander of CoG raids. <br>
<br>
Bottom line... as raid commander you don't have to put up with bullshit to give to the server. Some people won't like it, but I guarantee you, the people who stay, who are disciplined and who are there for fun will appreciate you a lot more than those who just come to get phat lewtz and are disruptive. And those are the people you cultivate by providing events for. The parasites and hangers on who just come to CoG raids to get a chance at their epics or their planar armour will drop off and you'll be left with the people you are providing this service for in the first place. <br>

In the event of a Chain Stunnable Situation - Drood must find himself near the Chain Stunner.  If said Drood finds himself staring at pretty colors all around, said Drood must begin the Evac Situation.  Thus we save the Enchanter from the Corpse Retrieval Situation and the furthering beggeth of Cleric a Ressurection Situation.<br>
<br>
I think I was referring to the Situation where Drood ran off into the woods to find a morsel to bring to the lazy enchanter and never came back alive Situation.<br>
<br>
I'll avoid the Kiting Situation wherein the Drood does not fulfill the Sow Situation.  Or the Get-Away-From-the-AE-Mob Situation.  Or the Drood Can't Tank Situation.  Or the WTF-Drood-Ring-Are-We Situation.<br>
<br>
I'm Pining for EQ.  Here I am in Rome, counting the days until the EQ Situation can come about once again.  I would give it all up for the not so menial task of protecting the kamikaze drood.<br>

In truth not much has changed on the server.  I'm sure others have kept you somewhat up to date.  SF is leaving, as will probably a number of people for DAoC.  FA and many other guilds have lost a lot of people to the larger guilds, but they're still around.  Went romping through Chardok with Bam yesterday.  Anyway, before I start getting nostalgic.

DAoC looks interesting probably going to give it a shot.  Random respawn locations, Named mobs that spawn with the support mobs in a nonrotational fashion.  Less focus on items and more on the technical playability.  Items that only exist in a singular fashion.  Dwarven Runemaster [drool].<br>

It seems a lot of people have moved on.  The Watchmen are down to pretty much its core group.  Although there are a few others left in there.  Many in both FA and CoK have moved on to Paralax or other larger guilds.  I know Palanka did, and several others.  Names escape me at the moment.  A lot of people still wonder where you are.  heh.<br>
<br>
WW is kinda cool.  Only problem is most of the mobs are on CoV faction.  Which is bad for us who are allies of CoV.  Heh.  However, they did change most of the other mobs to CoV so its fairly safe to run around.  Zellex and I have played there a bit.  You need to be careful as some of the wolves do summon, which will ruin a casters afternoon.  We're hoping to be able to put together a ToV raid very soon.  Zellex was planning on doing an exploratory raid this weekend, but apparently plans had to be scapped in light of Tuesday. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They've recently added the stonebrunt mountains outside of the Warrens.  Mid level zone with the trivial loot code.  I explored it a bit, but was quickly bored.  The zone just didnt do anything for me, perhaps I jsut need to take some people with me.  SoL is coming out in a couple of months and I expect that will revitalize intrest in EQ for a bit.  Although I expect I'll be eventually leaving for SW:G.  Gotta love lightsabers.  Overall things havent changed much.  People come and people go, we're all generally still having fun.<br>

Ooo.  You could be dangerous at 55.<br>
<br>
An EQ fallout could be interesting.  I used to hear people talking about Shadowbane as well.  That one seems a bit farther off in the line though.  Star Wars is getting close to completion?  That could be really interesting, especially if they allowed ownership of various ships and customability and such.  Would be nice to play a smuggler.  You a Jedi?  Make sure you point that thing the right way before you activate it.<br>
<br>
The star wars roleplaying game was fun as hell.  A thief is like an engineer instead of a locksmith sort of crap.  Carry around extra blaster batteries.. Blasters.. come to think of it, that game could get really exciting.<br>
<br>
Last time I was wandering alone in WW it seemed like some of the lesser creatures could be hunted.  Its ok if the mobs can summon.  Its not ok if they resist magic well.  We can teach Zellex to taunt, hell, while were at it, teach him to stay on his feet the whole fight.  I heard that Velks Lab is a happening place, no more all nighters fighting kobolds and icy watchers, I guess.  Unless people are just hunting the spiders for the shawl quest.  Ah HA!  is that how you got your levels?  Trains up there do strange things, the mobs sometimes cant get back to their spawn points and blind side you when your walking along in safe areas.  So, buh-bye Velks.  <br>

I understand Star Wars is about a year or so out.  But that there will be jedi and starships.  Although the star ships will be part of an expansion 6 months or so after the initial release.<br>
<br>
Velks has changed since we explored it way back.  It used to be a raid only zone to kill Bob or Velk.  Now with the shawl quest, and more importantly the increase in stats on Crystal Chitin armor, you can walk up to the Upper Kobald camp without bothering with invis.  You cant find a spawn for love or money.  CS is even overrun.  SG is now a single group to 2 group zone.  The mobs were majorly reduced in power and several mobs that were unsnareable now can be.  WW is still the same, except for the faction issues make it a lot easier to play around in.  Most guilds are now CoV aligned it seems, or else are playing both sides if they are large enough.  <br>
<br>
Heh, so when are you coming back?  I can see Haemish closing this thread soon since it doesnt really deal with anything CoG related.  LoL.  But hey, I'm part of CoG so by definition anything related to me must be CoG related right?  Right?<br>
<br>
I was thinking about DAoC but I really like being a druid.  Being able to port anywhere is a wonderful ability really.  I just cant seem to get into any other class.  But who knows, if most people I know moves over you never know.  Heh<br>

I have 4 minutes before this internet cafe closes, Haemish dont close this thread damnit.  Its imperative that this thread continue, based on a prophecy or some such.  The destruction of Norrath as we know it could be a major implication should this thread be closed.  Massive retaliatory attacks could be of a result.<br>
<br>
Ok, bad humor.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, closing thoughts before the nights end, I'll be back before you are even wiping the sleep from your eyes to give a proper response to your last email.<br>
<br>
Star Wars looks like you need an accounting and Real Estate background to be successful.  Ha! I've done computer work for both types of companies.  It being a year off or so may not allow a good few years of DAoC to be fulfilled before ditching one and going to another.  Star Wars looks like it needs a start right at the beginning to get a good jump on the land ownership and money making ideals<br>

Anyway, you still didnt answer the question.  When are you coming back damnit!  We're trying to start a guild named Emperor Bob and we need bodies!  Hehehe.<br>
<br>
As I understand it, land shouldnt be a problem.  A single planet is supposed to be far more massive than all of Norrath currently.  As as of right now, there's several planets.  Also, there's upkeep etc.  I figure you'll see a lot of prime real estate pop up, turn into towns, and several months down the line dissappear and become ghost towns.  It will be very interesting to see something like Sullon Zek there where people battle for control, either empire, independant, or rebel.  Control maps would be interesting.  Heh.  I still want a lightsaber!<br>
<br>
In fact...exactly what are you doing there?  Sightseeing?  souvenir hunting?  Looking for the Swedish Bikinin Team?  heh.  How are things over there?  Pictures!  Yes, we want pictures!  <br>
<br>
I'm personally unsure about DAoC.  While its interesting, SoL is coming out soon.  I'm unsure if I want to switch games, when I know I'll probably be coming back to EQ anyway for SoL.  Plus I need to upgrade my computer.  My p2 350 really needs work.  Course, everything else is up to date.  Heh.<br>
<br>
Well, thats it from here.  Probably should set up a new thread.  But this is kinda fun....<br>

Emperor Bob?  explain.  This wouldnt be something like Bob Dobbs would it.  Who is Emperor Bob! heh.  Bodies?  Sounds like some sort of cannon fodder death squad guild.<br>
<br>
Provided that my plane lands intact, at the airport it says on the ticket, I arrive home on October 1st.  Like the numnut I am, I disconnected all my internet connections with the providers, so now I need to deal with that Situation (The it takes 2 weeks to give me a new block of IP addresses -- NONONO the hardware was already installed 2 years ago, stay away from my home damnit).<br>
<br>
So I would say October 2nd is when Ill be around again. Ill be lurking on EQ related web sites until that time though.  Im just getting the wanderlust out of my system. Its gone, left, buh-bye wanderlust.<br>
<br>
The business focus of Star Wars looks really interesting, not to mention its backed by Lucas himself, so you know its going to be primo stuff.  DAoC just looks like a better EQ, but not to the extreme that Star Wars creates a living, economic world sort of deal.  I think I read you can buy property in DAoC but only existing property.  Its not possible to build.  <br>

Another special Kellory-run-raid-event.  I cant wait to see.  Of course I refuse to do anything but sit and make sure the Drood doesnt get accosted by some group of mobs.  Thus making my raid experience more pleasurable.<br>

Actually, Kellory run raids tend to go something like this.<br>
<br>
Kellory shouts, &quot;Okay, I'm in group 1.  Now then, remember when entering the portal, turn left!&quot;<br>
Soandso_0 says out of character, &quot;Which is my left?&quot;<br>
Soandso_1 says out of character, &quot;I like apples!&quot;<br>
Kellory shouts, &quot;Okay, groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 will enter now in 10 second intervals&quot;<br>
Soandso_3 says out of character, &quot;What group am I in again?&quot;<br>
Soandso_4 says out of character, &quot;I only have AE's loaded.&quot;<br>
Soandso_1 says out of character, &quot;I like apples!&quot;<br>
Kellory shouts, &quot;Is anyone paying attention?  Zone now!&quot;<br>
Soandso_5 says out of character, &quot;Can I have a sow?&quot;<br>
Kellory shouts, &quot;Go!&quot;<br>
Monk_0 tells you, &quot;60 people just tried to zone at once and Fear crashed.&quot;<br>
Kellory tells Paralax_Guild_Officer_1, &quot;CT is up. Wanna help clear?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yup.  Thats a standard raid.  Well...kinda.  Actually the raids have been fairly successful recently.  Obviously through no effort on my part.  Heh.  <br>
<br>
Poland.  Sorry, I dont believe in Poland.  It doesnt realy exist.  Its all a capitalistic plot.  Yeah.  <br>
<br>
Well, of course people are going to have to realize that you are my personal Clarity Slave and that they're just going to have to buy their own in EC.  I might add to those who are thinking of this, he was very affordable.  The trick is to catch them between levels 49-51 when people think enchanters are useless so they're broke and willing to do anything for some cash.  Even hang out with druids.<br>

Which guild did you join?  Its about time, your good guild material.  [cough]<br>
<br>
Actually Enchanters are fairly useless from 30 until 51.. and in some cases up until 55 or so.  Well, maybe its changed recently, as in, the rest of the community is understanding how to operate with them.  You put an enchanter in a group, and the best way to organize the group is to have everything revolve around the enchanter.. lol.  Its true!  (Well, maybe in my case, since I dont take orders or good suggestions well, unless repeatedly beaten into my head and my subconscious makes my rational processor think it thunk the idea up.)  Unless its a large raid, then the single enchanter in the raid becomes a buffing b$tch.  I still enjoy just single group scenarios, they are so damn fun and can really go well for hours and hours on end with much success in gathering of experience and the phat lewt.  Its also so much easier to get a good single group of individuals that work together as a tight team that know how to work together seamlessly.  The way they designed it.  I guess that was always the secret to the uber guilds, they broke through the large unorganized chaos raid problem and spent the time on their members to get them familiar with working together en masse.  I dont think any of them figured out how to share experience evenly though, as that was always the major complaint when I went on raids with the ubers... The people that dont play nonstop cant level because they spend their time going on the large raids with what little time they have online.  <br>
<br>
Did I mention the time I gave 3 crushed topaz to a magician's pet instead of the magician.  (Not sure how that fits into the train of thought)<br>
<br>
On another side note, I saw Gamgie made 60 - congratulations.  That lil halfling had nerves of steel, made it all the way up to Lord Yelinak without fainting on the way walking passed 30 foot tall golems that frowned at him.<br>
