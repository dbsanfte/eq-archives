I submit that your so-called 'indi' day is just as indefensible, and in fact is worse, because it gives a fraction of the independent people the chance to arrange raids, while other independents can't get on the list in time, and are no longer as welcome on standard calendar days because, &quot;You've got your raid.  Go sign up for it.&quot;<br><br>And all of your examples of people abusing the system have been conclusively proven each time to not be end-runs on the system.  In fact, the one case that you specifically mention (Taking up more than 6 people who are not in a posting entity) was something I would think you should SUPPORT, because it explicitly makes a non-calendared group able to go to the planes.  Why would you object to a calendar-posting entity trying to take along MORE people from a non-posting guild?<br><br>And the end of that discussion was &quot;We will not take all 7 of them up, only the 6 as proscribed by the rules, until this gets worked out.&quot; But you choose to believe otherwise, because it fits your belief that everyone here is evil.<br><br>You have contributed nothing to the discussion of an establishment of an FFA or Indi day since the topic has turned serious and people have discussed methods.  You are worse than useless for your so-called cause.  I have done more to bring to light the idea of an Indi/FFA day on these boards than you have.  You could have started this thread as a &quot;Ok, Everyone seems to agree we need to have some kind of indi/FFA day. let's hammer out the details and get it in action.&quot;  Instead, you post threats.<br><br>I used to think you didn't get it, Clept.<br>Then I thought you were trolling.<br>Then I ignored you.<br>Now I just pity you.<br><br>I hope you can understand and realize why your so-called plan is a bad idea.<br><br>I hope you decide to change your mind and not go up to the planes just to cause trouble.<br><br>Best of luck to you clept.  May our paths never cross on the planes.<br><br>And if you think saying &quot;the choice was yours!&quot; is a mantra that absolves you of all responsibility for your actions, think again.<br><br>Bias Schmias<br>50th Warrior<br>Glossolalia <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unaelyablacktalons.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Naelya Black Talons</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/13/00 7:27:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Alternative Plan A</span><hr size=1> Clept... I have to admit I simply dont follow your thought process on this. You claim:<br><br>Folks forming guilds for game mechanics... yes... this is absolutely true... however I dont see where this is an issue. Perhaps you're not understanding what the purpose of this move is? In any case it entitles FoR (to include all FOUR guilds now under this blanket Alliance) NOTHING more than what we had before. No extra days... no additional posting rights... so the fact we wish to merge to have a unified guildchat function for large raids makes us trying to twist what rule specifically? Please elaborate what rule this violates either in direct wording or intent for me because I certainly dont understand the problem you so obviously have with this. You accuse Foundation Rathe as a whole of doing something underhanded here... I take offense to that... as do most of my people... however since you have absolutely no clue why a unified guildchat might be beneficial for a 3 guild Alliance I will forgive you your ignorance of simple game mechanics and let the insult slide.<br><br>Knights of Phoenix was planning to take 7 people from the same guild to the Planes.... those 7 had no posting rights and I personally saw nothing wrong with this and thought it was a very nice thing for them to do... but yes... it violated the actual wording of the Rules. To comply with the Rules KoP made it clear they would limit numbers of the invited guild to 6. I've known Edwina a very long time... and know her to be honest and trustworthy... if Edwina says she will only take 6... I believe her.... no questions asked. If KoP had been attempting anything sneaky or underhanded they would not have posted. This event hasnt happened nor will it happen.... complaining about an event that &quot;might&quot; have occured is pointless.<br><br>If you have any actual PROOF a posting entity has violated a Rule by all means post it.... whining how Rules &quot;could&quot; or &quot;might&quot; be broken is nothing more than trolling.

We have been going round and round with 4 people since weve instituted the new calender: Xenth, Zanthor, Clept, and Jamany. I hear talk about others but have yet to see any proof of such even though it has been asked for. The fact is that the calender is not going any where, you may continue the flames and the threats but it is not going to get you what you want where the calendar falls apart. In fact, it is doing just the opposite where we are even more adamant about the calendar. This does not keep anyone out, at least not anyone who puts forth some effort.<br><br>On this last note i speak for myself and my guild. Clept if that veiled threat means what I think it does, well then your eq life is about over because you will be banned from the game. Either way, please reconsider your wording.
