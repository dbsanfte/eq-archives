I've been with ED over a year and a half and seen many players come and go, but a core group of loyal players remains through that time.  ED is a guild who has a lot of fun, is as close as a family, always helps out it's members with what ever needs helping, and even though we've gone through low times when we may not have had the forces to take out some mobs, we keep going.  Even many of those who had to leave still are regular posters on our boards and have nothing but praise to say of ED (some of who have posted in this thread to defend Kuras).  <br>
<br>
Kuras is one of the best necros on the server and a very talented player.  He is loyal to ED and does a lot for the guild and it's members.  He is one of the least selfish people I know and anyone who knows him would come to defend him saying that, yah, he can be a punk at times, but he's worth having as a friend and would group with him anyday.  So many people's opinions are not likely to all be wrong.  Mantuan is a great player, and a great leader.  Leaders always get the shit dropped down on them and he takes the responsibility for this guild with out complaint.  A leader is more of a servant than a free player.  Maybe it seems otherwise from his posts to some of you, but I could say the same about all these posts from many vols.  If it were not for Mantuan, I would not have joined ED in the first place and there has not been a day in the last year and a half when I've been uphappy with my choice of guilds.  Many people in our guild are not afraid to say what they think and for that they get flamed (i.e. look up haisama's old flame thread <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but I would rather have people in my guild who are not afraid to stick up for themselves and their actions than those who sit and take bs all the time.  I'll take their loyalty and balls anyday.  <br>
<br>
I was there for the whole affair in ToV and that was the day that vols got on my shit list.  I have never seen a guild with such lack of respect for another guild.  They asked for a chance at a rot mob, we waited an hour for them to attempt it.  When they wipe, we go back to our armor farming.    They train us and cause us to wipe.  They then demand that they get another chance at the rot mob.  We give it to them... blah blah blah it goes on and on with us dying several times and wasting about 3 hours that morning.  Yes, this doesn't mean all vols members are bad, nor do I think that.  It just gave me a bad taste for that guild and when I hear the story of what happened last night, I think: sounds typical of vols.  <br>

Mantuan, I seriously hope you cut your losses, admit defeat, and apologize soon. ED has been around a long time...certainly long enough to realize that a.) Rathe DOES have its fury, and b.) Its unavoidable and NOT pretty. Look at Faablar.<br>
<br>
For the sake of your members, for gods sake. You have to realize, that right now, your members are being put on several blacklists simply because their GL is giving the thumbs up to members training, and KSing.<br>
<br>
A shitstain on the Rathe is a shitstain on the rathe. But a shitstain guildleader is the highest representative of a group of people. and we can only assume that your members (especially the ones that have come here and decided that calling Kit a trailer trash crack whore was a viable response.) are shitstains as well.<br>
<br>
Grow up. Not for us. for your members. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurasroc>KurasRoC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>El'lar Dobluth</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/18/03 5:39:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=995.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kuras the retard</span><hr size=1> ALRIGHT NOW WE ARE GETTING THE KING 'SHITS' TO POST ON THE THREAD!<br>

Shit, posting about a talendor kill is rediculous as one or two of my partnered him recently. (don't remember exact details but there were no more then 2 or 3 people involved.) Do something noteworthy then start bragging. Or get into the higher end of the game and start dealing with public relations between other guilds that don't see eye to eye with you.<br>
<br>
If my guild members are so ashamed of me then why wouldn't they just leave? I'm not stopping them, i don't run a kindergarden. Freedom of speech bro, if they wanna make themself look foolish then that is their own problem. To you all i may look foolish, but hey, ED is the house of the outcasts. I don't care what your opinions are of me, i have plenty of friends ingame that know what kind of a player i am, and they sure as hell know its not a greedy one.

Allow me to point out to everyone in ED that your guild leader is acting like a complete fool, and is going to cause you much trouble in the near future if you don't get the poor boy in check.  It would be time to get rid of him if I were you, even if that means adopting a new name.<br>

Im not really sure what you said right here, but I'm almost positive it's because you left out some letters. Tommorow, at school, you may want to spend nap time playing with the blocks. If you look closely, they have fun little letters on them and can be used to spell out words as well as building little castles. Practice up for me, kay?<br>

As if I have the need to explain it to someone who welcomes trash into his guild, then somehow beleives the rest of the server will find it even remotely charming when you refer to yourself as &quot;the outcasts of Rathe.&quot; (which, by the way...isn't charming. &quot;outcasts of Rathe&quot; is a subtle way of saying &quot;Guild full of shitstains.&quot;) The accomplishment wasnt Talendor. The accomplishment was Talendor, Gore, Fey, Kelorek Dar, and Venril Sathir in a single day.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If my guild members are so ashamed of me then why wouldn't they just leave? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Its really odd that you ask that, because I'm asking myself the same thing. &quot;If Mantuan was my guild Leader, why wouldnt I leave?&quot; The only answer I can come up with is a hypothetical one. (Hypothetical means &quot;pretend&quot;, Mantuan.) And that would be &quot;Because I am a shitstain troublemaker too, and I can probably get more if I hang around with my own kind.&quot;<br>

<br>
Yeah..theres that phrase again. hmm...and Im not sure why you're ranting about Freedom of Speech. but anyway...<br>
<br>
The fact is, your rants here make your guild look like they need a few more foam helmets. and your guildmates rants and actions make it look like YOU need more foam in yours. If members are in your guild, coming here, and speaking, whatever they say (and what you say) is representative of your guild. I think that was the point most of us were trying to make.<br>
<br>
However, your response (assuming that you understood it) was that you simply &quot;dont care.&quot; And thats fine, if thats your stance. Now we understand (and by we, I mean the Rathe) that ED is apparently in favor of being the new shit of the server. I think most of us are completely prepared to treat you as such. God knows the lot of us need a new viable enemy.<br>
<br>
I know you think its cute and badass when you call yourselves the outcasts of the Rathe and everything, but you havent truly been outcasted, and its ALWAYS fun for us, the civil players in the rathe, to make the unwanted feel that way.<br>

<br>
So, back to the fight.  The pictures you showed STILL doesn't show Rikko with a train or him training you.  The most damaging picture is that of the threats of training.  From that picture and your comments here, it looks pretty clear that Kuras did indeed do what was claimed and now ED has all intentions to avoid it by name calling and pre-school chest puffing.<br>
<br>
Argue the point intelligently (a concept that has slipped you thus far).  The points being that Kuras attempted a KS (tagging a mob already engaged and being dragged back to a group prepared to handle it)which lead to the training of both guilds (though from what can be deduced...only yours wiped).<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting for ED's few posters here to actually discuss what happened.  The cussword slinging on both sides is good for comical value, but it doesn't speak to the cause and affect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=joekreeper1>joekreeper1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/18/03 9:48:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=995.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kuras the retard</span><hr size=1> Mantuan said:<br>
