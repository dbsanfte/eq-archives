He then later go back to his spot and wait for the next challenge.<br><br>Since we heard VS had been buffed aswell since latest patch we decide to kill VS before we res LoM/MD (don't wanna train them while they are looting their corpses, if something happens). <br>We kill VS, give a necro staff to Mighty Danes and res all the people that got killed in their attempt.<br><br>What is wrong with this Xedd?<br><br>We didn't train anyone, we didn't move over anyone....<br>So please get your facts straight next time since you obviously don't know even the half of it.<br>Thank you <p><font color=#345618><b>Slitz Jawbreaker <br>Crusader of Raging Fury<br>The Rathe<br></font><font color=#518626><br><i>"Meddle not in the affairs of dragons,<br> for you are crunchy,<br> and go well with mustard."</i></b> </font></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uslitzjawbreaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slitz Jawbreaker</A> at: 8/19/01 2:26:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueberan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eberan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Raging Fury GM</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/19/01 2:20:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FYI </span><hr size=1> LOL<br><br>You werent even there Xedd, you might wanna check your sources.<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueberan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eberan</A> at: 8/19/01 3:02:57 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uguernica.showPublicProfile?language=EN>guernica</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.steelstrip.co.uk/images/egg.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/19/01 2:28:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FYI </span><hr size=1> Xedd as i remember i didn't see u at karnors yesterday? <br>to repeat what slitz said MD had asked RF to go and help them kill VS, we didn't know either btw that they later asked for LoM help.<br>we didnt KS vs, we didn't evac and we didn't train, RF were all at the courtyard b4 LoM were there and we made no attempt to pull over them or threaten/pressure MD's in anyway<br>he dropped pos loot which was mostly handed over to MD's too and then we res'd them<br>we let u guys have the first try at him, we res'd u and we handed loot over, so how were we in the wrong? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.steelstrip.co.uk/images/Tuierrasig2.gif"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujandersunstar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jander Sunstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/19/01 5:27:50 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://splatfisk.dk/Jander_EZ.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Pulling from VS room</span><hr size=1> First of all, let me introduce myself, I’m a level 60 Ranger and a member of Raging Fury. Most of you probably don’t know me, and as you can see I’m a Wog and this is my first post on the RTA boards (and hopefully the last).<br><br>Since I’m normally the one that pulls Venril’s guards from his room when Raging Fury kills him, I can tell you that it is possible to get 5+ adds that are not coming from the room itself. I’ve pulled that room more than 10 times and it has happened to me once, so it’s not very common for that to happen, nevertheless it does happen.<br><br>I can’t explain where those mobs come from nor do I know why, but I’m 99% sure that the time it happened to me, it wasn’t someone else training the room. I’m also sure it wasn’t some kind of chain agro from when we made our way to VS prep room and they definitely didn’t come from Venril’s room.<br><br>Of course everyone thought we were trained, so /gu went berserk with phrases like ‘WTF who yada yada yada’*. But the only ones in prep room were ourselves and one fd monk who just wanted to be let out through the locked door and I know for a fact it wasn’t the monk. No one had arrived to prep room in the last 10-15 minutes, so I’m sure it wasn’t a ‘delayed’ train from one of us.<br><br>Anyway, it was a long time ago; so don’t ask for lots of details because I probably can’t remember, but it has puzzled me ever since.<br><br>Whether what I’ve described above is what happened in the incident on Saturday or not, I do not know.<br><br>Yes, I was there on Saturday, but unfortunately (or fortunately) my pc locked up while I was in the safe room before LoM and MD pulled VS and when I came back the were corpses everywhere, so I have no firsthand knowledge of what happened during their fight with VS.<br><br>I do however think that Xedd greatly wrongs us in his post. If Xedd believes we trained them during their VS fight he (and LoM+MD) of course has every right to be angry and I wouldn’t blame him for that. I for one, do not believe that was the case, but I don’t know for sure.<br>But you can’t really blame us for killing a mob that you failed on, it has happened to us and just about every other guild that competes for ‘uber’ mobs.<br><br>Thank you for you time, now go have fun in Everquest, that’s why we all play this game.<br><br>*) I’ve been watching too much Seinfeld, please forgive me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Best regards, <p><a href=http://www.raging-fury.org/profile.asp?charID=88><b>Jander Sunstar</b></a><BR>Warder of Tunare<BR><i>*Chomp chomp chomp...Jander takes a bite out of YOU!*</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxeddrc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xedd RC</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif  BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LOM</span><br>  Posts: 261<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/19/01 7:44:24 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.guildsob.com/artwork/eva345.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pulling from VS room</span><hr size=1> You remind me of the guy that gets pulled over on the freeway and says OFFICER I DIDN'T KILL 100 PEOPLE, when the officer was just pulling him over because he was speeding.<br><br>Don't fess up to crimes you didn't commit..right?
