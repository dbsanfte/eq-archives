<br>
Yes generally everyone gets symbol and sometimes we rune our melee. Both take peridots which are paid for by the raid fee. You also may not get as strong a buff or stronger, depending on what levels and classes we have attend. Meaning if the highest cleric is lvl 45, then if would affect the strength of the buff you recieve.<br>
<br>
Why did someone NOT get symbol. I don't know. I was not running the buffline. Also you need to remember that this was NOT a typical raid, due to the type of raiders we had and thier lack of discipline.<br>
<br>
Yes. Sometimes things get overlooked. If you did not get a buff that you think you should have gotten, ASK before you camp to chat. Ask your group leader, raid leader, or buff coordinator. But remember that they are busy (usually 7-10 tells at once) and it may take sometime for a response.<br>
<br>
We had an incident where the buffer was inadvently told to cast the wrong buff. As a result, raiders didnt have Resist Magic. After it was brought to the attention of the raid leadership, it was taken care of in the best way that was possible at that time.<br>
<br>
Raid fees used to be 50pp per person. The fees are used for reagents...i.e. peridots, coffins, etc... Normally this would come from a guild or alliance fund. But the KCoG is neither of those. That is why we have a raid fee. I recently reviewed how many reagents we use vs. how much we have in raid fees. This was the first raid where the lower fee of 30pp was paid.<br>
<br>
If you wanted to break it down... if you get both symbol and rune, thats 2 peridots. But what if we fail and your corpse is under the dragon or in a pit? What if we dont have a rogue that can do CR? What if we dont have a Necro that can summon? So the cost of geting a Necro or Rogue, plus coffin costs adds to way more than 30pp.<br>
<br>
We have had 5 of the last 6 raids be successful. We usually have had the privledge of a rogue who is an expert at corpse retrival (which lessens our need for a Necro). We don't always have a Necro and in the past have had to cast lev instead of DMF. Rezes would take ALOT longer if we didnt have an Epic Cleric with us. Having these people with us is an Honor not an expectation.<br>
<br>
Strategy-<br>
<br>
I am not a tactics expert. I learn from what others have done. In this case, I generally use the same tactics as my predisessor, Kommisar.<br>
<br>
I am a healer. So when I do change tactics a bit, it usually has to do with the role of the healers/casters in the raid.<br>
<br>
With a guild or allaince, it is easier to try or change different tactics. Again, KCoG is not a guild or alliance. When I do make changes I usually introduce them one at a time or based on the given situation. <br>
<br>
One of the significant changes I made was putting the clerics in the lair to heal the tanks, and leaving the rest of the healers as triage. This has been succesful many times. But I dont use it all the time. I didnt use it this last Naggy raid because we had only a few clerics and the behavior of the raiders.<br>
<br>
In closing I want to say, mostly for those who attended this last Naggy raid and who have been reading and posting on this forum:<br>
<br>
This was NOT a typical dragon raid. I have led 6 raids since taking over for Kommisar and the last 5 have been successful. But this last Naggy raid was the worst I have led as far as the discipline and respect of the raiders.<br>
<br>
I know things did not go well. I know mistakes were made by many. It was full of confusion and back talking.<br>
<br>
I will NEVER question someone why they did or did not do something. I will NEVER point fingers or lay blame. I will NOT single one person out to ridicule or interrogate.<br>
<br>
If something needs to be said, it will be done directly to that person. And if they need to be removed from the raid, they will be, as I have had to do on one occasion prior. <br>
<br>
We are all intelligent people who know right from wrong, and know how to learn from our own mistakes and from others. I hope we all learned something from this last raid that will help to improve those that follow.<br>
