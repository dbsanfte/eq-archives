Rules for the Planes according to Karadin but RTA does not make up the rules for the Rotations. Well then how can RTA enforce the Rotations and the Plane reservations. How can RTA revoke a guild's posting privileges  if they are just the host for links?<br>
<br>
So if it's correct that the guilds who get there first make up the rules so that they can play nice with each other while the rest of us build up our guilds to even get to their level, don't you think that they should submit their agreements to the community? Don't you think all players should be able to reference these agreements as opposed to players from 20 guilds sending Karadin, Kenshiiro, Brotor or the Pope a /tell asking them to explain the agreements of the mobs in HoT while they are pulling AoW?<br>
<br>
Then this agreement issue gets me thinking ...what if BoTS tells TL here's the agreement on AoW--You can't kill him unless you pay us 100k each time you kill the giant with the purple hat and if you don't pay us then you can't be on the rotation. Is NB, FK, LOL and LOM going to have to pay BoTS, too when they break the rotation?<br>
<br>
So I ask you, why doesn't the community as a whole get representatives to review these made up policies? <p><p style="line-height: 100%"><font face="Papyrus"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=189879"target="_blank"><b>Keranee Pureheart

<br>
There's no need to open the rotations up for general discussion because the rotation guidelines are based for the most part on common sense:  Kill the mob and join the club.  When the mob spawns on your turn you have 24 hours to kill the mob or pass to the next guild.  If you do not kill within that time, your turn passes to the next guild.  If a patch is declared, then the RTA reps will agree to have 'FFA' days as required. <br>
<br>
It's simple.  Your '10000 plat' analogy just isn't going to happen.<br>
<br>
Now, there -are- a few exceptions to the above rules.  These exceptions were not made just to suit us. They were made because the situations require exceptions.  An example of these exceptions are NTOV and the Dozekar rotation.<br>
<br>
You see, before Verant put in the random spawn code it wasn't an issue.  The drakes all spawned at the same time and if you didn't kill the drakes then nobody was to blame but you.  Now, however, each of the drakes is on a random spawn timer, and so we have to use common sense and WAIT until all of the drakes are up to kill them.  <br>
<br>
Why should Noble Blade tell BOTS/Tindi what their Blood rotation should be like?  When Noble Blade kills Blood, if we have a problem with the rotation THEN we will have earned the right to discuss it with the people who DO kill the mob.<br>
<br>
If you don't kill the mob, then what does it matter if you don't have a say in how the rotation goes?  If you kill the mob, you DO have input.<br>
<br>
Now, some bright person is going to say, 'But Borick, if we don't have a say in the rotation, why should we bother about YOUR drakes?  We're not on the rotation, so we're not bound by your rules.'  And you would be right.  If you're not on the rotation, then you can kill all the named drakes that you want and all we can do is bitch...  until the day comes when you want to be on a rotation and expect fair treatment from us.  <br>
<br>
The rotation system protects everyone, even the guilds that are not on the rotations.  It gives these guilds a chance to see mobs they might otherwise never see.  Snub the RTA if you will, but the day will come when you desire a fair shot at a mob, and the rotation guilds will remember your behavior.<br>

Simply put he said why would you ask me about Zland and not about permission on killingNamed Drakes?  Because a NB person whom I was in conversation with said to ask karadin about Zland, otherwise I would not have thought of it.  Eitherway Comparing me asking about a Zland encounter to me getting permission to kill mobs is apples and oranges.<br>

I want to make it VERY clear again...<br>
<br>
<br>
THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE RULES FOR DOZEKAR.<br>
<br>
Nothing new was made up, nothing new was added, just because people did not know that the named were part of the Dozekar rotation before, does not mean it that the rule was just made up to add them.  Maybe the rotation was named wrong, but at the time it didn't matter when the rotation was made. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthaldin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thaldin</A> at: 9/16/02 11:29:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kenshiiro>Kenshiiro </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadows of Yamabushi</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 2:48:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re</span><hr size=1> Rogg,<br>
<br>
You seem to be missing the point and taking my post apart for all the wrong reasons, and since i dont have alot of time as you do, i wont pick yours apart but ill sum up for ya:<br>
<br>
Since we are able to Kill the Named Mobs in ToV( I.E. half of the CoV quests, Doz being the other half)  we are(my guild) directly involved in these issues and should have a say so on what rotations they are on if any.  Should we or are we trying to dispute specifically how Doz's rotation is handled?  Nope nor should we, i agree with you.<br>
<br>
Let me just state that i am not trying to make anything FFA here, i like this server the way it has been set up.  I am asking for a little clarity of the rules and if something needs to be changed lets pass it by the Guild Leader or Reps who are on some rotations and proven themselves to be a solid guild. <br>
<br>
Because these rules were not clear to me, I &quot;thought&quot; that the named drakes were FFA.  Up until this point to my knowledge a mob was either FFA or on a rotation, eitherway there is no penalty for killing said mob(to me it was like killing stormfeather before getting Lodizal for the eyepatch).  The only penalty I knew of was being on a rotation and taking a mob down out of turn. <br>
<br>
What p!ssed me off the most was how I was handled after the fact.  I was expected to just know the special issue concerning Doz and the Named even when they were not posted on the Boards with all the other rules.  \<br>

But I agree with you that it isn't clear that MobY that is easily killed is a part of a rotation on MobX.<br>
<br>
For future reference, ignorance is the lack of knowledge, whether by omission or by lack of education on the subject.  I am ignorant of the laws of Zimbabwe concerning the sale of livestock, for instance.  Stupidity is the inability to retain knowledge or learn.  A stupid person will never be able to understand quantum physics, for example, regardless of the amount of effort put forth by other people to teach that person (and no, I'm not saying the converse, that if you can't understand quantum physics that you are stupid).  People get those mixed up a lot.<br>
<br>
I, however, have logging turned on permenantly so I can remember stuff...<br>
<br>
Kergin was the one who requested the name change on the rotation from Dozekar to one that reflected Dozekar and the named mobs.<br>
<br>
And this is the quote from my log from Karadin:<br>
<br>
[Sun Sep 15 19:55:09 2002] Karadin tells doz-rot:5, 'you ask me how many hp Zland has but cant ask me about Named?'<br>

Gromm, its as simple as this, you defining words for us is senseless, had these rules been posted this would never have happened, had these rules not been posted recently it would have happened again.
