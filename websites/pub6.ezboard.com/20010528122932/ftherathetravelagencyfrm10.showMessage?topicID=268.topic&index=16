<br>
The RTA &quot;community&quot; as a whole seems to be a &quot;bunch of windbags who don't know shit but have an opinion on everything much like the Senate&quot; (my words and my opinion).<br>
<br>
The &quot;calendar&quot; was set up by BoTS / KEG / CIW / MFH way back when the majority of you people thought bronze was the shit armor to have.<br>
<br>
Therefore I will go ONLY by whatever BoTS / KEG / CIW / MFH come up with.  Rest of you people be damned because you haven't gone through the 15 hour CR's in Fear OR the &quot;log out till next patch&quot; day trials that the rest of us have.  Your opinions mean jack to me.<br>
<br>
As for Khoros you can bitch and whine all you want about him but he has done 15 times more for his guild and the server in his period of play than you have done.  Many many people from all 4 of the aforementioned guilds have done more in their time of playing EQ than you can hope to accomplish.  <br>
<br>
Rathe is basically the only server with a calendar.  This calendar was put up as a means of communicating OUR intentions to each other.  Not to be used against us.  The rules are antiquated and full of bullshit loopholes w/ zero guidelines on punishment.  Personally I would love to see you attempt to PnP either myself or a guild as a whole. The plane of fear is not a &quot;camp&quot; that can be monopolized by one group. It simply cannot happen.  You can PnP &quot;a_scareling00&quot; to hell and back but the GM or Guide will continually have to remez the creature while either myself or others are beating the hell out of it to kill it.  So long as whoever goes into the plane of fear does not intentionally train another group or camp it's all good.  Thats what the /shout channel is for.  Anyone ever get banned for /shout train to guktop or /shout train to zone.  Don't think so.  Unless they intentionally did it over and over again.  Want to simply overwhelm the people in the zone and bring everyone on the server.  Again it serves the same purpose.  FFA will occur when some kayan guild zones in and there are already 90 to 150 people in the zone.  Get a zone crash and wait on the GM's to repop cazic.  After then 2nd or 3rd one I can bet you the GM&quot;s will say screw you and won't do it any longer.<br>
<br>
You want rules that will work.  You better damn well bring out people from each of these guilds.  And you better damn well put out some harsh and serious punishments for ANY &quot;loophole&quot; use or full out breaking of any rule. They are the ones who understand the high level encounters.  Not you.  Throwing 90 people at the queen bee on 6 means jack crap to me.  Put 36 up against her and take her out with a true strategy.  That will impress me. Putting the 18k queen of chardok out with 50+ people doesn't impress me.  Putting her out with 30 (+/- 1 or 2 people) and losing only a druid (which we have done) will impress me.<br>
<br>
Manas does as best a job as he can w/o knowing half the issues related to high level encounters.  Rewena knows jack shit.  Elaundar -- kayan pure and simple.  Dunno who the other admins are but I can bet that most of them can't lead a group of people past the Azeracks effectively in sky.  And yes I use all of these various encounters in the game to make my determination of peoples &quot;quality&quot;  If you understand the politics that you are dealing with as well as the time effort that is being put forth by people then you have a much better idea of how to LEAD the various guilds through the decisions that are made.<br>
<br>
Your calendar sounds all well and good but w/o punishments in place by the community it's simply a guideline.  You call them rules yet rules can and will be broken especially when there is nothing to lose.<br>
<br>
You can fully expect me to be in fear with my 60 lvl warrior and my by that time 53 or 54 lvl wizard (train an AE group, we'll love you for it) right there beside Khoros.<br>
<br>
<br>
You want to &quot;not group with CIW&quot; yay for you.  Don't want to rez my dead_corpse10000, I don't care.  I have login to enough clerics to come rez myself.  Most of us group with each other because of 2 little things.  Faith in each other and trust in each other.  I kill people w/ my Yangor pulls quite often.  CIW jokes over this.  But you think that my people will complain endlessly over it.  Nah they won't.  Because for every time I've killed them I've made them laugh at least 10 times more.  This is a game.  It's meant to be fun.  Frustrated because some moron says that some newbie guild can go be &quot;big brother&quot; in fear 3 days in a row is not fun.<br>
<br>
For those who want to flame me because I come across exceptionally contemptual then don't bother.  I do have true and utter contempt for many guilds out there, but it's from experience in trying to deal with them. I've personally given higher ended items away to newbies just for shits and giggles than some of you have even seen, yet you always seem to think that &quot;uber&quot; guilds are the oppressors.  Hell it's us who are being oppressed by moronic imbeciles. People who go and waste everyone else's time rather than asking for help have earned my cynicism. Get me a screenshot of you standing underneath the hand of veeshan and I'll give you fully the respect you think you deserve.  The &quot;big brother&quot; guild is there to HELP people.  Not TAKE what they would normally get.  The only &quot;reward&quot; for us &quot;big brother'ing&quot; is extra chances to go and finish our epic quests that for the most part you can barely achieve on your own.  We don't get &quot;uber&quot; gear off Cazic or Draco or anything else in the plane.<br>
 <br>
Here's a nice rule that is absolute, doesn't require endless bickering and whining : <br>
<br>
FFA the plane ANYTIME Cazic is up.  Period.  There are no time limits to this.  There are no &quot;blah blah blah let's write 25,000 amendments to the &quot;rules&quot; etc. <br>
<br>
From this point forth barring an agreement being made by the guilds who originally MADE the calendar this is the rule that I will follow. So spew all the wind you want from all the &quot;little&quot; guilds who just hate us big &quot;oppressors&quot; I don't care.<br>

Now Howard, I don't think you can seriously snub your nose at everyone but those 4 you mentioned.  There are many quality guilds out there and I won't even try and mention them all.  And our guild has never tried to prove anything to anyone else.<br>
<br>
The calendar has loop holes....and it has actual holes where rules don't exist.  So lets work on them.  No it won't take 9872349873 amendments.  But we need to work on a few.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So lets step up to the table and discuss this.  There are a few ideas out there.  Things that are easy fixes to the problems that everyone seems to see.  Lets ratify them in and be done with this crap.<br>

<br>
Yep, those 4 guilds got there first.  What did they have that the other guilds did not that allowed them to get there first?  Two things alone: time and motivation.  <br>
<br>
This game is easy.  Yes, easy.  There are *maybe* a couple dozen total tactics available for taking on every single challenge in this game.  The only barrier to beating this stuff is the number of people available in various classes, their levels, and their equipment.  Sprinkle a bare minimum of organization and discipline on top and you can do anything.  &quot;Leet Skillz&quot; do not exist, not in this game.  The guilds you mentioned kill bigger stuff because they have more people, at higher levels, and with better equipment.  Boils down to a time investment that builds on itself, the trailblazers can never be caught now that you are ahead.  This is not something you can be overly giddy about though.  It amounts to almost nothing.  If you hadn't done the 15 hour CRs in Fear learning by trial and error, someone else would have started on it 2 weeks later.  It's that simple.  <br>
<br>
Here's a shocker for you; some people actually given the choice to be where you or an average CIW member are right now would still choose to just play the game to have fun and not like it's some kind of arms race.  Anyone who is smart and attentive while playing can do pretty much what anyone else can do, it's just a matter of *what* they choose to do with their time.  Smarter people then you would naturally tend to choose to avoid the hassles that you are putting yourself through right now (and many on this board know what a twisted little existence you lead in EQ and envy it not in the least).<br>
<br>
People can take some pride in what they do in EQ, but lets face it, your entire self-worth is pretty clearly built on your achievements in a game.  Hard to believe you even keep close track of exactly how many accounts you have access to, like it's some measure of power.  <br>
<br>
Geezuz, man, get a life before you end up jumping off a bridge somewhere.  I'm serious.<br>
<br>
P.S. As for the kayan-type comments about people in PoA, people also know that you use exploits to get around in that zone, so better not to talk about people's skills in that plane, ok?<br>

Taking the amount of time they've taken is just not right.  Perhaps have their BB status stripped away, forcing them to reachieve this status.  IMO Noble Blade (as an example) can do a lot more than they can, but we're not a BBG, simply because we haven't killed the specific mob as outlined in the calendar *rules*.  Hell, we've taken Talendor, the second guild on the server to do so despite attempts by many of the other guilds.  FFA of the planes is not the answer to recent events.  I see that FR was having problems taking out CT, and should NOT have had the time they had, they should have conceeded and stepped down and taken the shame rather than to try and fail many times.  The incident with MFH/FR with VS was a bad one, but perhaps should have been done in this situation.  I commend FR on their perseverance and determination, but when a god or other coveted spawn is up for an extended period of time, people get REAL itchy and start snickering and talking, some get irrate, others snap.  Someone snapped and now wants FFA, this is a bad thing.  FFA screws guilds who can compentently clear planes in a reasonable amount of time, but lack the *uberness* to KS epic mobs from other guilds.<br>
<br>
FFA is NOT the answer, find another one.  Find a solution that screws as few people as possible.  I like Milambus's ideas about timeframes, if others have ideas, post em.<br>
<br>
Perhaps put BBG's on a strict rotation for gods/BBG mobs.  If you're not a BBG, one comes in automatically (whether you can take the god or not) and abides to all BBG rules (doesn't loot any mobs, gets NO loot except epic loot.)  If a BBG that is next in the rotation is unable to attend or doesn't have the numbers to kill the BBG mob in question, then they are skipped and not returned to until the rotation is completed.<br>
<br>
I didn't read Howards post, I chose not to lose brain cells with such blabbering.  But, these are my suggestions, take them as you wish, that's pretty much what I've come up with as solutions.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukhorosatwork.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KhorosAtWork</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Tad-pole</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>58</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>2/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>2:52:55 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: I have a much better idea</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Somewhere along the lines everybody started thinking FFA meant KS.

They are able to clear Fear, god, draco, and full pop, in a short period of time (5-6 hours).  I have personally witnessed this.  The time problems they had on these instances began with the need to CR the folks resident in the plane at the time, with more CR.  It also takes a certain amount of time to get folks who are unfamiliar with each other to begin to work as a team...which is necessary to clear the plane in a minimum time.  FoR is not one to zone in and take over, either.  They try to teach the posting guild some things that they do not know (*boggle*..what a concept!  someone actually trying to help rather than mow over).  And unless you were there (which you were not), you cannot have the facts enough to judge whether they took too much time or not.<br>
<br>
And not only that, but I know that other Epics called in took as long, or longer, than FoR allowed themselves, but FoR stayed strictly within the 2am time limit, and that is something to commend them for.  On the day that they did go over the time, they had the consent of the next days posting entity.  Ok, so it was themselves, but regardless, the Sat posting entity got all the loot except those epic piece(s?) that FoR received for their assistance.</font><P><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Edwina Nytengayle<br> </strong></font></center>
