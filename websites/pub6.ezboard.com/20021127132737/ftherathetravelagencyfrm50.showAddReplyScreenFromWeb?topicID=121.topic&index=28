I was present for this conversation and this comment is taken out of context.  Karadin was saying that Kenshiiro has no problems asking Karadin about information on other mobs/rotations, with the example Karadin stated as being how many hit points Zlandicar has, but yet Kenshiiro didn't think to ask Karadin for the information on any HoT rotations/conventions.  It had nothing to do with 'asking permission' for anything.<br>

So you were going to tell my guild about them when we can kill Doz. That is like closing the barn door after the cows have escaped. A little late. People hunting in HoT see a named and think, this guy might drop something really good. Lets try him. I suggest we get used to the named drakes being dead as people who know nothing about the RTA will kill a named trying for loot.<br>
<br>
Fine. We might understand the reasoning for wanting them on the rotation. But will it work? Most rotation mobs are hard to kill unless you have several well equipped groups. These guys are not in that class.<br>
<br>
Are there any more “hidden rotation” mobs out there? You need to speak up on this or we will go through this again.<br>

I understand the nameds have a quest piece that goes with Dozekar, but that was not listed on the rotation.  Now for you to come on and say that the nameds are now part of the rotation is basically making up rules as you go and stepping on everyone else who can or have been killing the MOBS in question.  Its like saying dont kill the golems in Fear anymore cause they are now on the Cazic Rotation.  Well that just screwed the people who have been able to kill the golems and not CT. <br>
<br>
As i understand it if the RTA is only for links and stuff, then how was a vote taken place for the rotation schedule?  If these rules are being changed and Mobs that smaller guilds can kill are being taken away from them, then how is this rotation what the community wants, unless they voted on it?<br>
<br>
We have to camp quest Mobs all the time, but they are not on the Rotation.  I think the rotation is great and I'm all for it, but please don't change the rules and expect the smaller guilds who can kill the Nameds and have been, not to be upset.<br>
<br>
This is just my opinion as a citizen in the community of the Rathe, I AM NOT speaking for my guild.  Thanks <br>

<br>
The RTA consists of guild representatives.  All the guilds on the server are, in theory, a part of it.  Whether a particular guild actively participates and is represented is their responsibility.  Someone can only be removed from a rotation or such by the request of the guilds participating in that particular rotation.  Guilds who were once, and could still, participate in a particular rotation are also given their say (for example, BotS no longer participates in the Yelinak or PoF rotations and it is clear that we still could if we wanted and we still have a voice)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So if it's correct that the guilds who get there first make up the rules so that they can play nice with each other while the rest of us build up our guilds to even get to their level, don't you think that they should submit their agreements to the community?

<br>
Before now, there weren't a lot of guilds pushing into the mid-level or high-level content.  Most everyone knew everyone else and what mobs were on rotation.  The guilds who were, knew who to talk to about rotation issues and it was easy.  Since a number of new guilds are pushing into these areas, it is probably best that the agreements be published for viewing (not review).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Then this agreement issue gets me thinking ...what if BoTS tells TL here's the agreement on AoW--You can't kill him unless you pay us 100k each time you kill the giant with the purple hat and if you don't pay us then you can't be on the rotation. Is NB, FK, LOL and LOM going to have to pay BoTS, too when they break the rotation?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, if such a thing were to happen, I'm sure Tindi would tell us that we are FoS and then we'd begin to hammer our a rotation agreement that all parties could agree upon.  Eventually, someone else WILL kill the mob and will also have their say.  Even if Tindi did agree to such a stupid agreement, BotS would have to give way or risk being pushed out of the rotation by the other two members.<br>
<br>
Many rotations lately were handled between BotS/Tindi/NB/(SoT) as simply stating that you killed MobX and wanted the 'standard rotation agreement' on it.  We all knew what this meant and would agree or hammer out a few details (like Ikatair/Eashen or named in HoT) in addition to that.  Agreements like ToVN didn't come about in a single day.  BotS and SoT representatives exchanged quite a few emails and even met in the game and in IRC to discuss the agreement.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So I ask you, why doesn't the community as a whole get representatives to review these made up policies? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why would a guild of perpetual level 14 roleplayers need to have a say in content that they have not witnessed and probably will never participate in?  They would have some notion of fairness but they would have no clue as to the actual content involved.  Why would killing Aaryonyar give you 48 hour access to 8+ other mobs uncontested?  That doesn't sound too fair to all the other guilds.  What if other guilds wanted to kill one of those mobs other than Aaryonyar? Why can't they? Why do you need 48 hours? It's the mechanics of the game and encounters that make that agreement fair to the guilds involved.  At best, such voices would contribute to fairness, but if a guild is not pushing for fairness for itself, there is something wrong.  At worst (and far more common), such voices would add lots of noise and detract from the actual negotiation process.<br>
<br>
If you want a say in a rotation, fulfill the terms to get into the rotation and then you'll have a voice.  By that time, you will have experienced the content and will have a better insight into what it's all about.  Neither NB nor Tindi have never asked for a change in the ToVN rotation agreement.  Once they experienced it, I assume they saw that the agreement was reasonable and fair and found it agreeable to let it stand as it was.<br>

<br>
For you to say that we are 'now' changing the rotation implies that we are lieing and/or have some hidden agenda to screw people over.  The fact is that the guilds who participated in the Dozekar rotation have *always* done it this way.  Because the 'rules' weren't posted until now does not imply that the rules have suddenly changed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As i understand it if the RTA is only for links and stuff, then how was a vote taken place for the rotation schedule?

<br>
Rotation schedules are 'voted' on at the time someone is added to the rotation.  For instance, BotS kills Arch Lich (AL).  BotS is the only guild killing AL for a while.  No issues yet.  Tindi Losi then kills AL.  BotS and Tindi agree to a rotation, taking turns on AL, 'standard' rotation rules.  NB is bored one night so they decide to kill AL.  NB announces that they have killed AL and want into the rotation.  Since NB killed AL on what was actually BotS's (I think this was actually the case) turn, then BotS will go after them so now it is NB, BotS, Tindi in that order.  This is accepted with no contest by all three guilds involved (the community for the AL rotation).<br>
<br>
Again, your are accusing multiple guilds of changing the rotation rules on the fly and lieing about it to suit their own ends.  In most cases, the Dozekar rotation (in this case) is almost 'out of style' for the guilds involved.  Why would they want to do this?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We have to camp quest Mobs all the time, but they are not on the Rotation.

<br>
Again, you are assuming that the rules were changed in the last day or two.  They were not changed, they were finally posted in a public forum so that you could see them.  Had you asked NB or Tindi 6 months ago, it would have been the same... even a year ago it would have been the same.  The rules as posted have been the agreement since it started.  BotS didn't participate in the Dozekar rotation for over a year until we got kind of bored.  We had nothing to say (nor should we have) on the agreement for the Dozekar rotation but I did see it take place.  In the end, we did get on rotation and we didn't ask for a reconsideration of terms because it seemed fair to us.<br>
<br>
The reason the named have been being killed was out of ignorance (not being offensive) of the agreement.  My guess is that none of those guilds bothered to ask anyone if there was even an agreement on them, much less what the agreement was.  The named have been disappearing with little/no explanation for a while and it was only recently when people started finding out which guilds were killing the named.  Now, some folks were brought into a discussion recently and everyone realized that the problem was a lack of information (the rotation guilds didn't provide it in a public forum before now and assumed other guilds would ask an existing rotation guild about it like everyone else had until now) and that is being corrected - the naming of the rotation being changed by request to more accurrately reflect the terms of the agreement and the posting of the agreement itself.<br>

I guess what I wanted to see out of this is the written gentlemen's agreements that the first guilds make up and expect the rest of us to follow be public. I guess that was done.<br>
<br>
I also don't want to see the rest of us being called ignorant for not knowing your guidelines just becasue they are not public. That's just down right not necessary. It's not like we don't look for these rules or follow what rules are published. <p><p style="line-height: 100%"><font face="Papyrus"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=189879"target="_blank"><b>Keranee Pureheart

Please accept my apologies if you think I was calling anyone a liar, that was not my intention at all.  I don't word things very well sometimes, but after reading it I can see. <br>
<br>
I think after reading Gromms Points and Thaldin, I guess it was just a clarity issue where the agreement was only known to the ones on the rotation.  It was just that when guilds got bigger they didn't know cause nothing was posted.  So really can't really blame anyone.  <br>
<br>
I do worry though, cause as guilds get bigger, will we run into this again?  What named Mobs are guilds gonna have to check on to find out if they are part of a rotation?   <p><center><image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif><b><i>"Big Bad Bonedaddy"</i></b><image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif><BR>

There were no guidelines specified publicly about Doze and the Named Drakes and I don't want the members, guild leader or officers of SoY viewed as not comprehending said guidelines. It's a little different from the &quot;I didn't see the stop sign&quot; theory. We know there are stop signs from the guidelines presented to you in the manual you get at the DMV. Looking for the stop signs is up to you.<br>
<br>
We looked for the guidelines about the written Rotations (as of yesterday being Doze and NToV and not Doze and named) and there were none about the named drakes. Doesn't mean we don't comprehend or adhere to Rathe Rotation mob policies.<br>

<br>
&quot; Its like saying dont kill the golems in Fear anymore cause they are now on the Cazic Rotation. Well that just screwed the people who have been able to kill the golems and not CT. &quot;<br>
<br>
This wouldn't happen.. why? Because the golems' loot isn't directly linked to CT's loot. The drakes DROP NOTHING but the symbols that must be included with Dozekar tears. I am not even sure they have a chance to drop armor, but they might.<br>
<br>
If you're not on the Doze rotation and killing named drakes, you're one of the following generalizations: a) no idea that they're linked to Dozekar in any meaningful way, b) Know exactly what they drop and kill them to hoard symbols till the day you can kill dozekar, c) kill them because you kill dozekar too.<br>
<br>
Choice A happens.. and I don't think that's the issue.  I think B is the issue because  guilds on the Doz rot feel that they're being taken advantage of by guilds soon to be on the Doz rot who are planning ahead.<br>
<br>
If you KNOW what these named have, and you're killing them without being able to kill Doze.. then you're directly crapping on the spirit of the rotations in general.<br>
<br>
As for the other part, KIC did kill the named a few times before they killed Doze.. but once KIC realized the impact it had, they stopped.<br>
<br>
Most of the guilds capable of HoT/planning on killing Doze are NOW aware of the impact (if they weren't before, and doing it anyway).  It will be interesting to see if the drakes stay alive or people still kill them out of rotation or out of turn.<br>

<br>
As an aside, since then, we've been hunting HoT almost every weekend, and I don't think we've even seen one of the named drakes up. We have found Dozekar up a few times, though. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I could care less about the Dozekar rotation...if the named drakes are part of it, works for me. I'm just a poor cleric who's tired of having to res my guildmates because of would-be Dozekar slayers pushing through HoT (and then training us while they CR) when we were there first. You have 24 hours to kill Dozekar...we only do HoT for a few hours a week. Is a little respect for the camp really that much to ask?<br>

  I've read this entire thread, several times over actually, and many have had valid points on both sides of the issue. It seems although we have yet to come to a consensus with respect to the Dozekar issue, we all seem to be leaning towards the general consensus that the issue is made more complex by the &quot;Dozekar incapable yet named capable&quot; guilds involved and that more thought is required to solve this issue. I'm glad to see that this is being addressed. <br>
<br>
  What hasn't yet been addressed directly and frankly is the real reason behind why the Dozekar capable guilds want the named to be on the same rotation, at least not comprehensively. The reason is loot, simply put. The &quot;Dozekar capable&quot; guilds seem to have found the quest items from the Named elusive, more so than the Dozekar quest items. So having the named up each time they do Doze is very convenient. Yet, the &quot;Dozekar incapable&quot; guilds would sure like to get a head start collecting those elusive quest items prior to getting themselves on the Dozekar rotation so that when they are capable of doing Dozekar each kill very well may represent another completed quest. I don't blame them for this either. But here is a question for you. If the Named mobs involved in the quests were not in the same zone (as is the case with many quests), would they still be considered on the same rotation? If Cazic Thule and say, Wuoshi dropped two items for the same quest would they reside on the same rotation? Or would Wuoshi remain a rotationless mob? (Silly example but you get my meaning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
  Another question, unrelated to Dozekar but still having the general spirit of the discussion here. Should a guild not be allowed to farm PoF if they are incapable of killing Cazic Thule himself? No? Then why can they not farm NToV without killing the boss mob there? Why is it such a sin to enjoy the available content in partial form, the part you are currently capable of? Because the rotation guilds do not benefit from it? Well, of course that's the reason. Do I necessarily disagree? Hmm, perhaps you should ask when I am on that rotation....  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  Don't get me wrong. I recognize fully that the &quot;lesser&quot; guilds benefit greatly from these rotations as well, perhaps more than the current rotation guilds. I for one would hate to be racing &quot;uber&quot; guilds to many of the mobs I am capable of killing now. But at the same time I am being denied content I am now currently capable of for fear of being steamrolled lest I adhere to our current rotational rules.<br>
<br>
  Somehow, it still leaves me dissatisfied.<br>
<br>
  Please be aware that my comments here in no way imply that they are necessarily representative of my guild as a whole.<br>

<br>
The unwritten rule of the Doze rotation as established by the rotation founders were that named + doze are a package. That's fine, and worked well at that time, especially since 'random spawn timers' werent in place at that time.<br>
<br>
Now there are 5 or so guilds on this rotation, and the named spawn at all times. What if the 3 others ALL would prefer the drakes to be FFA instead?  Does the majority rule in this case? How would this be handled?<br>

The Etiquette(sp?) forum is still pretty new and we are still trying to get all the information into that should be there.  Emil's post will be moved there, so this information is availble to all.<br>

The bigger guilds are used to having to talk to each other, we do it on a daily basis.  You newer (newer meaning newer to these rotations) are not used to doing this, so we are trying to get the information out there for everyone.<br>

Should we have done this sooner?  Yes.  But we're human too, we do make mistakes.  We are now trying to correct that, and have the information out there for all.<br>

<br>
-- This would bring up a case of 'using the rotations to your advantage, while at the same time, ignoring the rotations to your advantage'  It is unacceptable, and has come up now and again thru our history.  If you do not wish to follow established rotations, for your own good (read: banking drakes until you can kill doz) then the 'rotation machine' will not be abliged to protect your other mobs you have safely reserved for you, whatever mobs they may be.<br>
<br>
in a nutshell, you cant sit on the fence, regarding the rotational system.<br>
<br>
and ill restate whats been said 1000 times above:<br>
<br>
- dozekar: ~7 day pop, drops 1/2 the items for the CoV quests<br>
- drakes: ~ day pop, drops other half of the items for the CoV quests.<br>
<br>
---if you kill drakes, and can't kill doz, you are (a) oblivious to what they are for/how they are handled (forgivable) (b) self serving, and planning for the CoV quests, looking to gain a head start.<br>
<br>
There is really no other alternative.  If you are planning for Doz/CoV quests, then you are 'sitting on the fence' as it has been clearly (and rationally i think) explained why these 2 entities (doz+drakes) are treated as a single package.<br>
<br>
Please, trust me - when you enter the doz rot you will highly, endlessly appreciate the drakes protected for YOU, when you are up.<br>
<br>
--edit:<br>
<br>
to directly adress jurassic's question:  This still applies to the 'sitting on the fence' analogy -<br>
<br>
&quot;I want a mob(s) ffa when it serves me, but damn right, i still want statue of rz, tormax, zlan, etc.. to be protected by a rotation for ME!!!&quot;  its principles, you are either pro FFA, or pro-share/rot.  It is impossible (ethically i suppose) to pick and choose how you want to act, as it serves you.<br>

Guilds that are up for Doze/named need to watch for them.  But guilds in HoT can just send them a tell to come get them too.  Its a 2-way street, we all have to work together.<br>

<br>
Killing the drakes yields NO loot except quest items.<br>
<br>
I think only one quest requires 4 Tears from Dozekar where all the rest require a combination there of.<br>
<br>
Logically, to make Dozekar worth while to kill, you need to kill the named drakes along with him, hence how it was decided it was a package deal.  Even after the advent of the random spawn timers (Blah), the guilds on the rotation were able to keep it as a package deal for the most part.<br>
<br>
There was an occasional accidental killing from time to time of the named drakes by HOT farming guilds, but it was worked out.  To keep all this intact isn't that difficult, it's just asking the people that are there to be a little more careful.<br>
<br>
I know the pull routes inside the HoT like the back of my hand...I should after all this time, and I can say for a fact, you can farm the left side of the Dozekar room (facing in from the door) without ever touching a named Drake.  They all spawn behind and to the right of the room.  Unless you fight to the exit, you can avoid ever killing the named drakes this way. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthaldin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thaldin</A> at: 9/16/02 3:27:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujurrasicepoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 474<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 6:41:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> Thank you for replying Emil, but I don't believe that it DOES answer my question.<br>
<br>
Though the named and Dozekar ARE linked in that the two 'parts' from each complete the quests, they are NOT the same mob.  <br>
<br>
While the initial founders of the rotation decided to make them a package deal, it does not have to be this way. <br>
<br>
Otherwise you could make the claim that all VP medallion mobs and ground spawns are part of the Trakanon rotation and must never be killed by non Trakanon guilds or rot guilds not currently up for Trakanon.<br>
<br>
The question was IF the majority of Dozekar rotation guilds didn't care to check HoT every day for their named to spawn and decided that it was just as easy to 'take em when you want em' (and there have been times that Doze is killed multiple times before the named are touched) does the majority rule in this decision to remove the named from the rotation? why or why not?<br>
<br>
Again please keep in mind that this is hypothetical, and FK as a Dozekar rotation guild makes no position for or against a change at this time, but it should be hashed out as I have a funny feeling that this sort of issue may well come up in the future with 'linked' mobs in PoP, as well as with Doze now.<br>
