<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You don't &quot;encourage&quot; someone to do something by punishment.  You &quot;encourage&quot; people moving deeper in dungeons by rewarding them with more xp for killing harder mobs, not by removing the xp lower end mobs give, thus crippling soloers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Secondly, in regards to your idea that somehow DOT stacking will help a shaman solo. . .read the patch message.  DOT stacking only allows two or more shamans or necros to stack the same DOT on the same creature without overwriting one another.  It does not allow one shaman or necro to cast the same DOT on the same mob again and again.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thirdly, no matter how you look at it, with the game's crowded servers, removing any high end content is a bad thing.  What percentage of the playerbase do you think has a L 50+ character?  I would say at least 50%.  Now you want to &quot;encourage&quot; all those players to go to only a handful of zones?  Do you remember L Guk and Sol B pre-Kunark?  If this patch stays, that is what CT, Ssra, Umbral Plains, and Deep Chardok/Akheva will become.  Anyone wanting to xp as they were before this patch will have to sit in overcrowded zones waiting for hours for a spot to open up.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fourthly, guild raid resentment will shoot through the roof.  Expect lots of group buffs being cast to find the 4 rogue or 4 wizard group who is getting all the big mob kills.  Knowing that not only does that group get first look at what loot dropped, but also made 4% AA xp while your whole raid basically powerleveled them, and watch new heights of grief.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fifthly, I see you making all these points about druids and shamans getting better heals, but I see no mention of it in the patch message.  So they lose soloing as a viable alternative, and still have no enticing reasons to be wanted in groups or more raid utility. . .   How exactly is this balanced?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sixthly, I think it incredibly cheesy that they add more soloability to clerics at 56+, and then nerf soloing in its entirety.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If Verant leaves this patch as is, I expect to see a lot of cancelled accounts.  Soloers who feel hosed, casual players who can't xp nearly as well as before, hybrids who aren't as wanted in groups, but can't get near the xp they used to, etc.  Overall, I think this is one of the shoddiest, least thought out, and downright wrong patches I can imagine.  And it's real.  That's the scary thing.<br>
<br>
I will say one nice thing about the patch.  I missed the Ding noise, and glad they gave it to making AAs.  Too bad it will be such a rare noise. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

It's one thing to develop a group-based game where soloing isn't productive. It's quite another to have a char lvl almost to 60 and make them have to shift into a style of play they might not be used to.<br>
<br>
But the big problem is, everyone who doesn't go after big mobs is gonna get a lot less xp than they used to. Jack up higher mobs' xp, great, but don't punish people for killing the same mobs they've been killing. It's fine to talk about the big dungeons, but for some people they're not an option.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I think ToV as an xp dungeon would be hilarious. Make all the lvl 60s lurking in Seb and Velks downing aaxp go and give a couple more people a chance at some good loots in those dungeons.<br>

for now, druids will have a little bit harder time exp'ing than we normally do, but it does not bother me much. The heals will come in time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> As for quadding:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
It cracks me up that this is continuously brought up as the way a druid gets exp, or is the &quot;uber&quot; exp for druids. Quadding past level 56 ( or when raptors start to light blue out) is rediculously inefficient for 90% of us (druids) out there. Quadding takes about 4 bars of mana to kill a mob; give or take a little. Now, the average druid does not have FT15 and maybe does not have a ready supply of c3 available. this means that after each quad, there is approximately 15 minutes of medding. <br>
<br>
At 56, i got 1/4 a blue quadding raptors in TD. Half that at 57. Then at 58, i tried ME quadding toilers. still the same efficiency, but roughly 1% of regular exp per quad. Melees in FG are far more efficient killers than this.<br>
<br>
This is why a good portion of druids do not quad at all post 57; many find a nice quiet spot to root / dot them<br>

Back 2 years ago, this was not even a problem; but now, mob HP, DPS, and warrior HP have all increased, while the druid heal has not. We simply want to be put back where we originally were as far as healing goes.<br>

Lol, long time no speak.. <br>
<br>
First, I don't see anything that was done as punishment. That's just me. They did increase exp that higher end mobs give, and I don't think that lower end mobs exp has been decreased as much as it seems, because of the removal of hell levels.<br>
<br>
2nd. I wasn't talking about stacking the same dot one on top of the other. As I understand it, from recent conversations, only 2 or 3 dots per mob really had any effect. This patch changed that.<br>
<br>
3rd..What do you think people are doing in Seb/Velk's/KC now, if they're not sitting at zone-in for an hour looking for group? Granted, there are classes such as pallies/sk's/monks that frequently solo in these zones, but what about the rest of us? Making the soloing of these completely 'risk-free' exp mobs less efficient in my opinion, will make these dungeons more usable by the players that get the most out of the mobs. And, I don't have a problem with the upper lvl zones becoming places you can LFG in. Like I stated before, I find it not at all challenging, or entertaining killing the same mobs at 60 that I did at 50.<br>
<br>
4th... I agree.<br>
<br>
5th.. No, as far as I know, they weren't put into this patch, but it's almost assured that they are coming. And no, I don't think it's fair that they split the nerfing into one patch, and the upgrade into another.<br>
<br>
6th.. How many 56+ clerics were really going to solo, anyway?<br>
<br>
Finally, I see and understand all of your points. Do I think soloers are getting hosed? Not really, because I play two classes that suck at soloing, and have always resented the fact that those classes can gain lvls faster than I can. I don't think casual players will get exp less efficiently, if they move out of zones that have been risk-free and elementary bullshit for 5-7 levels. And, I don't think hybrids have truly ever had that much difficulty finding a group, especially of late. SKs and Pallies are as good, or better tanks that warriors, rangers are doing mass damage with bows, and bards have never had to look long for a group.<br>
<br>
So, while I understand your points, and appreciate their validity to some extent, I ask you this.. What's fun about a game that is only challenging every once in a while? Once I beat Mario Bros. for the 3rd time, I quit playing it. Well, fighting in Seb/Velks/KC with a lvl 60 toon, is like playing Ultima in God Mode.. How is that really fun?<br>

After seeing this I am only too scared to see what kind of exp i'd get in Guard, or a camp in KC... As for the Ghey, err Grey, it's been fuct up for about 20 patches now... I stopped going there, necro and I used to duo there but they've added about a billion traps...<br>
<br>
I think this is all a ploy by verant to make us get out VP keys so we can exp off the 2 min repop guardian wurms in there.<br>

I've killed over 10,000 otters. I quit counting at 10,000. I soloed almost exclusively from lvl 56 to 60 with 32 AA off of otters. I kill them so quickly now that after taking down 8 of them and medding I still have time to kill some drakes or othmir shaman before warrior repops.<br>
<br>
On raids I wish I could heal better. Too many times we've been wiped out because of a lack of healing. I'd prefer to not heal in 'exp' groups. I think that a fairly mana heavy heal that healed half of the max hp of the target would be great for druids and shamans.<br>
<br>
After the UP patch Elysians always resisted my spells often until I reached 60. Most of the time we hunted them in a group of 2 or 3 druids.<br>
<br>
I can see where the line of sight change will make it more difficult to kite in many of the common kiting places.<br>

What is really missing from this discussion is the most wonderful gift to druids since their epic... an epic that no longer snares!!! That's right... the druid epic no longer snares. <p><font size=-2>Going home late last night<br>

Chances are, it will just inspire them to spend more time in these zones, or stop playing altogether. If it only inspires them to stay in these zones longer, well..yeah, it punishes them as well as whomever the content is designed for.<br>
<br>
When you head off to somewhere more difficult to grind exp, you have to pay attention.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you can form up a group of lower levelers and spend your time soaking up most of their exp while pulling half the zone...I guess....<br>

So you've never been killed in seb? Never had to CR Chef?<br>
<br>
Sometimes the challenge of mobs is not *just* the mob, but also the location and the people in the area. People that used to go to CT, are the people that are usually very skilled at their class, know what to do and when. Don't get me wrong, people who go to seb are like that too, but here's the hitch now: Everyone from seb and velks who figures out that the XP in groups is now A$$ flavored, will head to CT (among others), for the higher level mobs. <br>
<br>
Sometimes Seb is hard because of the group you are in. The group that has 6 people and still doesn't move from the zone in for an hour, we've all been in that group at one time or another. The group that takes half an hour to CR to guard. The group that REQUIRES CR in guard. You get my point. <br>
<br>
Put that same group in Cazic thule? Hell no. Hell no. <br>
<br>
Anyway, Personally, I like bigger mobs for grinding on, hell, I'd XP in ToV if it wasn't so damned slow per mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Removing the xp on the lowers was dumb; no question. Upping the XP on the bigger mobs? Good call. Too bad they f'ucked the execution of a good idea. <br>
<br>
Not VERANT? NEVER! <br>
<br>
Anyway, if they fix it, good. If they don't, well, I like the game for raiding now, not for levelling. I feel quite bad for those who didn't make 60 by now though, really. <br>
<br>
Hopefully Verant will pull their head out soon.<br>

<br>
Dosent mean I enjoy EQ less then you.<br>
<br>
And while I agree that this change can be slightly good by forcing people to do more challenging mobs...keep in mind how many level 60s there ARE and how few viable for xp level 55+ mobs there are.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that this is the death of most soloers except for the traditional necro, druid wizard.  There's many people in my AFK situation where grouping would hurt the other group members because of the need to AFK a lot, among other reasons.<br>
<br>
While I HAVE the ability to solo 20Khp + mobs in UP with reasonable downtime, many people do not. This is the death knell for the non uber monk, rogue, warrior etc soloing in FG or Katta, as a barely blue mob is all they CAN take.<br>
<br>
They need to keep the rewards for higher level mobs, but return to the previous xp level for low blues.  The REAL powerlevellers will still head to the 4 arm camps in ME or UP or WW for the better xp.<br>

Uhm, take the shaman part out of that. A soloing shaman has not been effected with this patch in regards to their technique. A shaman has 3 DOTS - Poison/Disease/Epic which prior to patch all stacked with eachother. <br>
<br>
Kinda annoys me tho that they made these experience adjustments. When i get home from work i only have a couple hours to play, so i will LFG in seb for about 10 minutes (rather then 1-2 hours) and if i can't get a group then i am off running to howling stones to solo in there. This is basically going to make my HS fun worthless because of the reduced experience. <br>

I feel that this penalizes those of us whose EQ time is limited - guess Verrant doesn't want 'our' kind of money..  <p><b>

<br>
1- Druids have long been asking for better heals.  Warriors now can reach 6k and more.  Mobs now have millions of HP and do 2000 and up damage in a round.  Druids heals have still done the same ammount of life, basically making us less and less effective in raid situations.<br>
<br>
I (speaking from a druid point of view) do not have a problem being a back-up in a raid.  But I do have a problem being an in-effective back-up.<br>
<br>
This game is designed, as VI has said before, as made for co-op gaming and high-end raid encounters.  What do druids contribute to high-end encounters? Not terribly much, so its only fair that VI give druids a little something more to work with once they get into the high-end raiding game.<br>
<br>
For the druid argueing earlier (sorry I forgot your name <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) what is the point of quad-ing to level 60? What do you plan to do after that? Quad to 100AA? Than what? Go on raids and sit there doing nothing? Heh.  Not to attack you, sorry, just asking you what the point of all that leveling is.<br>
<br>
So I am all for druids being less effective in soloing and more effective in groups/high-end encounters.<br>
<br>
2-  The exp being reduced on lower levels mobs is dumb.  I was hoping they were trying to make high-end raids more experience worth it.  I.e. killing mobs in ToV all day might yield something more than a couple of pieces of armor.<br>
<br>
Hell, after this patch I can see PoF and PoH turning into exp zones on non-reserved days, heh.<br>
<br>
3- The cleric hammer, @#%$ dumb, sorry.  A lvl 60 cleric friend of mine was buffed by a shaman with Focus, Primal Essence, Avatar and Celerity.  With these buffs she procced EVERY OTHER attack, that is 150DD every other swing (about).  I am sorry, but that is a hellalotta damage for a cleric to do in melee.  I doubt my 54 monk would beable to outdamage a 56 cleric with the same shaman buffs at this point.<br>
<br>
What was the point of making clerics able to solo better? Why would a cleric need to solo? They can get a group almost anytime they are looking, much less than I can say for alot of melees out there.<br>
<br>
4- Some of the things they did in the patch were good however.  Some of the new spells are hear are really nice.  <br>
<br>
The new 'link_an_item_to_chat' thing is pretty cool, mute when compared to the experience problems, but cool anyways.<br>
<br>
5- No comment on the resists thing, havent played my druid since the patch to test it.<br>
<br>
Hrm, anyways, thats about it for now.<br>

<br>
Hmm, pre AA points, Karnor's was upper 40's to mid 50's.  Since AA points, I've seen Karnor's become a Low 50's to 60 zone.  Will this change make 56+ look elsewhere?  Possibly, but then that might also give those upper 40's and low 50's the chance to find more groups in there again.<br>
<br>
Not much else I can comment on, although I'm sorry to see so many of you upset with the change to your soloability.  Changes are made supposedly to improve the game.  With these changes, some players are never happy with it.  Additional changes may be made to appease these unhappy players.  Lets hope that a compromise can be worked out for those who are happy and those who are unhappy with this recent change.<br>
