Ragefire and Link Dead people suck. During the middle of the Ragefire battle, Things going good we shout Casters nuke. Bah.... bam 2 clerics go link dead and more peeps GAAAA lagg cant move. Was sad to see fighting with my last breath dying at the O in Zordakalicus Ragefire. Switching over to my cleric charactor healing the one of 4 last tanks.. being killed running back in room to get 1 more heal off from being bound outside room. Bam seeing the life line on the z in his name watching the last tank go down.<br>
<br>
<br>
THANK GOD FOR FRIENDS....<br>
<br>
Sent a tell to cycotic asking for help AC came and gave us a much needed boost of moral...So much thanks for the fast help and rez too keep Rage from despawning...<br>
<br>
<br>
SAD THING....<br>
<br>
LOOT LOOT LOOT... we were there to help Muffin not for loot the moment the Rage drops I am in tell hell I WANT THIS I WANT THAT... So we let the no drop helm rot.... EVERYONE knows I will let loot rot first.. before I let it become a I should have got thing. The 2 no drop things... We gave the 100% weight reducer to Forsakenn... we though that Obulos deserved too but would be more benificial to a monk. AS for the gloves. We have not decided who to give them to. BTW forsakenn is not in our guild. <br>
If any ever needs help from my guild and my guild mates start screaming about loot you send me a tell I will slap them silly. WE come to help never to loot.<br>
<br>
<br>
But once again Thankyou all for helping and congrats muffin.<br>

<br>
Lag spike &amp; LD are the best mob spells in the game.  Cost no mana, no cast time, and any lvl mob can do it. Sometimes even before you know they are there!  Then they just send a tell to their buddy mob that your bind point is at /loc ## and his buddy camps you till you stop popping.  :P  But seriously, that does suck. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Glad you pulled together, kept him from despawning and got the help together to pull it off without him getting another LDtouch off. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
--- Turns out I once again ramble after this point, but I had some things to say that directly tie to this and need to get some things off my chest.  So long post warning.. ---<br>
<br>
As far as the loot thing goes, I understand your reasoning behind what you did, but personally think it could have been put forth a little clearer and with more consideration.<br>
<br>
Of course we were there to help Muffin.  And obviously with the nervousness / anxiety of keeping him spawned and the sudden influx of people needing to be grouped and asking constant questions, etc. I don't blame you for not mentioning before hand about loot.  Although, it may be something to remember in the future to do, or have someone handle questions like that for you / announce it before hand.  You have every right to decide about loot on your raid, and if you don't want people around that are only there for loot, this will make them leave.  (both saving you more headache, and them anger / resentment later) Most times I have done larger / non-open raids, I didn't even have to ask about loot before hand.  I knew that unless everyone already had / didn't want something, I wouldn't get it.  And don't mind in the slightest (all about the thrill of the hunt, loot is just a bonus if it happens <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  But a lot of people are only used to going to open raids and such where everything is randomed, so they don't know this is usually how things work on guild raids.<br>
<br>
As far as people sending you tells that they wanted loot, someone asked in OOC about loot and you replied in OOC to send you a tell if you wanted any of the drops.  This may have been meant for the guild so you could compare to list / whichever system you use, but again, not at all made clear to people not used to this and not their fault if they did what you said <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Don't get too hard on people about wanting loot.  Remember to keep other peoples views and goals in perspective.  There is no justification to think that your perspective is more valid, or better than someone who plays the game to attain lvls and get items.  You cannot expect everyone to want the same things as you in RL or in a game, and think of them badly because they do not.  To me that is worse than KSing any spawn in the game, because you are KSing their right to have the most fun in the game by playing how they want because it is not how you think things should be.  <br>
<br>
This is not to say that there isn't a certain morality / immoraility people can posses and display.  The problem with this though is again, how do you tell?  Because, what it comes down to is, accidents happen, people make judgment calls, and sometimes end up hurting someone else in the process.  The truth is, in my opinion, immorality is doing something with the intent or knowledge that it is going to hurt someone else, or help you at their expense.  You run into a rare mob and target it.  It has full hp.  Standing still (not chasing anyone) and you promptly beat the crap out of it before anyone else happens along to find this treasure.  Then you start recieving tells / hearing shouts / threats / etc that someone else had pulled it and you just KSed them.  To me, you did nothing wrong, because there was no intent / knowledge of wronging someone.  And of course the opposite holds true for running up to a mob someone is fighting and outdamaging them to get the kill so you can get it.  You know you are wronging someone.  <br>
<br>
But, you can take this a step further. (and maybe this will help some people understand what it took me a long time to realize) Since there are so many people that have so many varying ideas of what is right and wrong in the game, and where they want to take their character, it leads to further things that can be considered wrong by the mass populous, but not by the individual.  As in the above situation, someone happens across somone fighting a rare mob they want.  Well, SoAndSo_01 feels that there is nothing wrong with him taking the kill.  He has worked hard in his mind to achieve the power to do so.  Although he knows this person may get upset, just as he would, because someone else got shiney_thing_01, he doesn't think it's &quot;wrong&quot; for him to do it or someone to do it to him.  To him, it is a game. A virtual world where he has achieved the power to do this and where he does not want to be confined by the &quot;rules&quot; set forth by other people in the game who want different things.  He never agreed to these rules.  He doesn't think his actions or anyone else doing the same &quot;wrong&quot;. He knows that his actions will most likely cause friction with those that have this differet view.  But why does he have to comprimise his view of what is fun?  Would that not defeat the purpose of &quot;playing a game&quot;?  I am willing to bet the first argument would be &quot;why does he have the right though to make the game less fun for someone else?&quot; But that is simply turned around with &quot;Why does someone else have the right to make the game less fun for him?&quot;  In the end, I have no great wisdom to impart, or a solution to make everyone happy, I am merely trying to show that in the end, right and wrong / justice and injustice / morality and immorality is something noone can truly judge, but the person who commits the act.  All that generally happens when we judge someones act for them, is degrees of judgment that can never truly be accurate, and in most cases, are terribley innacurate becuase the judgment is based on our view on the issue, not theirs.<br>
<br>
Ok, Ok, I will stop (for now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
I drifted off topic a bit there, but that's nothing new <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To finish what I was saying on topic, yes, it was great that everyone came and helped Muffin out, and it is nice when people come for the sole purpose of assisting.  But it is really not fair to criticize them, after they came to help you, because they were interested and feel they deserve an oppourtinity to get &quot;a_shiney_object_01&quot; off &quot;a_mob_they_just_help_killed+01&quot;?  I am not saying you should have necessarily given out the loot. I am saying, I don't think it fair to think poorly of them for not knowing your policies, or hoping for the chance at something random and nice after coming to help first and foremost.<br>
<br>
In truth, I found it much more rude that at no point from people arriving, to killing rage, directly asking about the loot, the corpse poofing, and you leaving, did you ever clearly state your intentions or reasoning behind your decision to the assembled party.  Although it may not have made some of the people much happier if you had simply said what you did here, atleast it would have been open and honest.  The way it was handled, left many people looking at it as ungratefullness and greed.  A simple, clear explanation such as you posted here of your intentions would have possibley helped to set a lot of peoples minds at ease.<br>
<br>
Sorry to carry on so long here.  Just get carried away sometimes when talking and noone on the other end to directly interrupt me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

P.S. This post isn't meant to be a &quot;why can't we all just get along&quot; thing.  We can't.  plain and simple.  But maybe if we recognize that other peoples opinions are still valid, even if we don't agree, we can spend some more time having fun playing a game, and less time being disgruntled and flaming people on boards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uaragusfyreblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragus Fyreblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/28/01 9:44:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=788.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Muffins Epic</span><hr size=1> Grats Muffins <p><b><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=51635>Aragus Fyreblade</b></a><BR>

YOU were not joking in saying it was a long post.<br>
<br>
1st. I asked cycotic to come. We shorta had a premade rough pending deal that if one of our guilds called for help we run with no questions and help. Loot would stay with that guild. In return we do the same. I have no idea where these other peeps came from. Wow lot of nice people want to help...<br>
<br>
2nd. I had no research prior on the ragefire camp other than was like naggy but we would not be booted for being 53+. I am waiting moments before obulos makes the charge call and get a tell from muffin asking what about loot? I am like confused. Then she says last for 5 min before rots. I said  something like I will deal with it. That is when I found out that ragefire drops more than just the cleric epic piece.<br>
<br>
3rd I dealt with it right, wrong I am not sure... My main thing is muffin got her epic.. and I will help any cleric that request my help in getting theirs with no loot chances. I turn down all loot. Period dont want it get it away.<br>
<br>
4th cant take all the credit for letting it rot. I defered and put the decission on someone else. Knowing they were just as preturbed as me about loot at the moment. <br>
<br>
ninja edit: yes I did ask for tells that was after about 5 tells as to what is who getting. then I started asking what classes to help decide.<br>

<br>
1st. After reading your post, I cought that, but in all honesty I think most people that came to help had no clue about any of that.  Most probably recieved a tell like I did (scary thing is to think about all the people that got tells that didn't show up, and how many people would have been there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :O --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":O"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) something along the lines of &quot;Muffins first attemp got wiped, but they still have him aggroed to keep from despawn.  Hurry if you can to come help&quot;  At which time I loaded up nek gate, clicked a sow potion and boogied.  With either the thought in their head of &quot;gotta help muffin, gotta help muffin&quot;,  &quot;Gotta help muffin, would be kewl to win something too&quot;, or &quot;No clue who the %$#@ Muffin is, but might get rage loot&quot;<br>
<br>
2nd Understandable, and beyond your control.<br>
<br>
3rd &amp; 4th I am not trying to say anything about how the loot was distributed, right or wrong.  or if helm should have rotted. Sorry if it came off that way.  Basic idea was to try and give you perspective that some of those people might have had.  Just didn't feel it was fair for you to criticize people for wanting loot on a dragon raid when they were never told about loot rules.  You weren't in the wrong for your decision, and they weren't in the wrong for wanting a chance at something. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
(and as far as rage loot and going just to help, I am the same way.  Done 3 Rages so far, and yeah...  I do it for all the caster items he drops...  yeah...  those..  uber.. wait, nm :P  I do it for the combination of helping out, and the fun of killing a dragon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
I am really sorry if I came off / you took my post as being an attack.  Was only trying to see if I could clear up a little what some of the people might have been thinking so you don't harbour too bad of an impression of them.<br>

Just a tough situation when you find out right before the dragon drops there is more than the loot you expected. Was just putting out what time pressures there were. If I would have known more loot was going to drop I would have made my standard list of what drops off and what classes get. Then watched to see who busted butt. Obulos rocked on cr. He got nada. If somthing would have dropped that would have been appropriated he would have it. <p>Litli DeFair 55 Wizard <br>
