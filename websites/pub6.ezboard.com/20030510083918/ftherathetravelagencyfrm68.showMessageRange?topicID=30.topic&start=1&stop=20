Iraqi citizens attempted at first to pull it down by climbing to the top of the statue and tying a rope around his neck but were unable to pull it down themselves. They turned to a US engineering vehicle to finish the job and cheered as it came down. They threw their shoes at it and broke off his head and drug it through the streets. There were also Iraqi's with banners saying &quot;Go home human shields, you us wankers&quot;. This has been played on multipul networks, supposedly on Al-Jazeera as well, although I can't confirm that a fact yet. You all can decide for yourselves what images such as these might mean, but for me they show what I have known all along and that is the Iraqi people welcome us and are ready to be rid of saddam and his brutality. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=joekreeper1>joekreeper1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/9/03 12:18:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Statue toppled</span><hr size=1> The Iraqi's here in Chicago were dancing in the street and making plans to return to their homeland.... but that is propaganda from Bush I suppose.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dembiredeadbones>Dembire Deadbones</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.w3.org/Icons/Misc/skeleton.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/9/03 1:15:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Statue toppled</span><hr size=1> I'm sure the Anti War people are saying that we are making them celebrate at gunpoint or something, or maybe the Anti war people are gonna just say that they were just joking this whole time<br>

The Iraqi people have had to live in constant fear for 20+ years under this man and the Baath Party.  Now that they realise we will not leave them, and that we are their for their liberation they can freely voice their joy for what is going on.<br>
<br>
For the Anti-War liberals that use excuses such as Blood for Oil, I hope that you now seeing these people's reactions helps you understand the true mission that the US/British Coalition has undertaken to liberate Iraq.<br>
<br>
I also hope that our men and women serving over there continue to stay safe as it isn't over yet, and there is much for them to still do in Iraq.  I especially pray for friends of LoM that are currently in the region (Whiff, Jilin (yes we know your job contribution to the effort must have been huge), Slovmit, and Oarwind..although believe Oarwind is not in Iraq. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.legendofmarr.com/images/sig/ghalid.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I must make this clear. The Iraqis dancing were promised Oil money if they pretended to be liberated. They really loved Saddam I swear it, he was great buddies with the people, and you Americans destroyed a 40 year friendship!! <br>

<br>
<br>
Martin Savidge of CNN, embedded with the 1st Marine Battalion, was talking with 4 young marines near his foxhole this morning live on CNN. He had been telling the story of how well the marines had been looking out for and taking care of him since the war started. He went on to tell about the many hardships the marines had endured since the war began and how they all look after one another. He turned to the four and said he had cleared it with their commanders and they could use his video phone to call home.<br>
<br>
The 19 year old marine next to him asked Martin if he would allow his platoon sergeant to use his call to call his pregnant wife back home whom he had not been able to talk to in three months.<br>
<br>
A stunned Savidge who was visibly moved by the request shook his head and the young marine ran off to get the sergeant.<br>
<br>
Savidge recovered after a few seconds and turned back to the three young marines still sitting with him and asked which one of them would like to call home first, the marine closest to him responded with out a moments hesitation &quot; Sir, if is all the same to you we would like to call the parents of a buddy of ours, Lance Cpl Brian Buesing of Cedar Key, Florida who was killed on 3-23-03 near Nasiriya to see how they are doing&quot;.<br>
<br>
At that Martin Savidge totally broke down and was unable to speak. All he could get out before signing off was &quot;Where do they get <br>
young men like this?&quot;<br>
<br>
One of the commentators finally responded &quot;America&quot;<br>

I don't know why people confuse people that are anti-war with those that don't care about positive change.  Personally, I am very anti-war, but I'm also very glad this whole thing is over.  I believe that there had been lives sacrificed that I deem un-necessary, but in the end, the results were good.  One thing people should remember about those of us who are anti-war is that we do not differ on what results we'd like to see, only the methods used to achieve those results.<br>

This quote amuses me greatly.  So what you are saying is people who are anti-war are not original.  How is that different than people who are pro-war?  I mean looking at the posts here it's pretty obvious there are more who are pro-war than those who are anti-war.  Does that make those who are pro-war even less original?<br>
<br>
The last sentence amuses me even more.  When did anyone even say they wanted to please Saddam?  Btw how do you even begin bringing intellect into this conversion when it's purely based on personal opinions? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=118063" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~ywz/xarien.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

You've said nothing Intellectual Xar, the arguments you use are sophomoric at best.<br>

you make a great assumption that myself and others base what we believe on personal opinion, while the reverse is true our personal opinions come from knowing the facts, weighting both views, and using logic to determine which view is the most valid. That is how grown ups come to conclusions.<br>

When did the conversation include intellectual discussion?  Or do you actually mean the discussion concerning intelligence?  If so, that's a very awkard sentence to express that idea.  Anyways I find it pretty silly that you believe opinions have anything to do with intelligence.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=118063" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~ywz/xarien.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

People base their opinions on their interpretation of facts, fiction, and anything else they've run across.  I really don't understand how you can associate it at all with intelligence.  I mean with this type of close-mindedness, next thing I'm expecting to read is that there's only one &quot;true&quot; religion.

What are they ranked for Psychology?  What are they ranked for World History?  European History?  Middle Eastern History? Philosophy? Seriously.  Your point is mute to the discussion.  Now, if we were discussing how to build a bridge over your bullshit or how to rebuild Iraq, then you'd have made some sense.<br>

Gee, I know some people that went to Duke (N.C.) for Microsurgery.

Nevermind, your &quot;mmmkay&quot; was all the answer I needed.  I see the light now.  You are absolutely correct in everything you have said and I bow before your greatness.<br>

Joe, just nod your head yes and walk away.  This one is a &quot;no winner&quot;.  You see, since they took engineering and have the ability to critically think, they will argue with a fence pole until it falls in.  After which, they will argue with the hole left behind.  Why?  Because there are no laborers to look in the hole and tell them it is empty.<br>
<br>
Xarien, I apologize.  I see now that you have vast critical thinking experience that relates to the current situation.  Your critical thinking allows everything you say to be an opinion and everything anyone else says to be a flame.  You are my new hero.  Please feel free to erect a shrine in your honor on my behalf.
