<br>
 I am sorry but I think alot of people coming down on Jascenta way to hard. If people logged before doing CR the bringing your own coffin the next day and having a necro go out of the way to summen you is not alot to ask. And since when is coffins supplied at open raids the day after a wipeout?? You all are acting like every single person thier was thier to help her with her epic which I am sorry is BS some were thier for loot and some for the exp of killing a dragon and probably some to actually help her fact is open raids suck and many have failed. <br>
 Actually I think Jascenta may have worded this wrong and  is getting bashed for having a AC guild tag and other reasons, so if you were at the raid and are having a hard time with Corpse Retrival please give me a tell in game and I will help you get your body.<br>

 Well........so the rest of us should be bandwagon whores eh?? Granted LoS is the most powerful guild on the server and mad props to them.....but alot of us don't wanna join something that other people have worked for and accomplished long before we came, we actually enjoy playing the game and learning new things together and accomplishing things on our own together....taking the good with the bad....but obvisouly you are not one of them. <br>

 She suggested buying a coffin to the people that logged before the corpse retrivel, should she really be responsible to get coffins to the people that logged before this was done?? Think about that...and possibly gotten all the body's....hell alot of clerics don't even acknowledge a wipeout..<br>

<br>
you want a recap here it is.  I wrote my thread at 7am after 3 hours of sleep.  I am sorry if things came out wrong or you misunderstood me.<br>
<br>
35 ppl at naggy raid<br>
3 clerics 1 of which never even made it to lair.. never sent a tell asking for aid.. a few other ppl as well.. so naggy was actually done with 2 clerics.  <br>
<br>
Naggy was at 5% when it failed.  we were gonna do a 2nd attempt but too many ppl left.  We were trying to get the rest of the corpse out of the lair.. some ppl logged before cr and it took us too long and fgs began to repop.  the monks and sk fd and a wizzy was in loop death.  <br>
<br>
Now I was in tears at this point.  And how dare you make it seem like i didn't care.  I was preparing that raid way before it started... in total I had spent 12 hours on that raid.  Yes flame me.. I am noob cause I wanted the raid to go well and I wanted to be prepared for it.   I had Alex help me because he has lead many naggy raids and I didn't want things to go bad.<br>
<br>
Ppl kept agroing Naggy so everytime I buffed someone I got TL'd out.  Now if it took you 3-5 mins to zone you'd be in tears too.  I think Alex got fed up of me having to gate to lair so he had ppl charged before I was done.. <br>
<br>
Anyway 5% wasn't bad for 2 clerics. <br>
<br>
We got all the corpse except 3 of the same person who logged.  I was in solb for almost 5 hours after raid ended.  <br>
<br>
The reason I said get a coffin is because I was flying back to Montreal today and I wasn't sure if I would be able to log on because of my even slower puter..   and even when I did the corpse would be non rezable by the time I would log on.<br>
<br>
I reserved 1 item... so what?  All the epic peices were up for grabs and all I asked for was an item that was uber rare to drop? HOW DARE YOU even touch on that.  It didn't stop ppl from coming.. I don't think anyone cared.  I would think for a level 45-52 player their epic would be of more interest no?  <br>
<br>
Maybe I will just wait for a guild to do naggy and just help them instead of trying to make my Rage camp faster and the Rage list move.  I don't have to run Naggy raids.. It doesn't say any where on the rage list I have to.. I did it to make things go faster for the rest of the clerics on the list.  <br>
<br>
Thank you for twisting things around.  And btw AC was clearing Hate to get to Inny... Which btw dropped for the 2 day in a row by us.  BTW IB please have your members stop asking me if they can come on our raids... Don't you do your own raids?<br>
<br>
<br>
My pp isn't bigger then yours, for one I don't have one.. and for 2 I don't give a flying poop what your guild does.<br>
<br>
oh and btw.. Los isn't an evil guild, there is a lot of very talented and very nice people in LoS.  Just because you can't do what they can doesn't make them a bad guild.  <br>
<br>
bah you who flame me are poopie heads! :oP<br>
