I'm sooooo happy for you and your belief that you're so brave.  Infact, I should go sign up for the army right now to out do you.  Kudos to you Joe.  <br>

I have a question for you Joe.  Have you ever served in combat, if so where and what was your job? Because then by your own admission, a Navy seal is braver than you, anyone who died for this country is braver than you.<br>

<br>
Not only that, but i'm supposed to take your word that you joined the army to support this nation and that you didn't join it in a time of peace just to get it on your resume?  So, you volunteered for the very reason I just quoted you with?  What about those in the army who joined because they couldn't afford an education? Or how about those who joined because their life was in a downward spiral and they needed some kind of order restored?  Just because someone was in the army does not make them brave or braver then anyone else.  Your LOGIC is faulty.  Martin Luther King Jr. never drew a gun, yet faced adversity.  He was never in the armed forces and never took a violent outlook to solving problems.  Many would call him brave.  Again, your LOGIC is faulty because bravery instills itself in so many ways that you can not say that just because you served in the armed forces, you are braver than me.  <br>

Braveness is just like beauty, it is in the eye of the beholder. That does not diminsh the fact that I'm sure most who join the army ARE brave, but it is not an absolute in any way. <br>
<br>
I personally would not join the armed forces in any country, because I could not see myself killing another person. I can not even go hunting with my friends, because I can not fathom killing another living thing, with the exception of bugs... I detest killing.<br>
<br>
Now some may say ah hah, hypocrit, well to you I say BAH! While I do detest killing, and wish we could all live in peace, harmony, and bunny hugging happiness, I am not ignorant enough to believe it is possible. Well maybe somewhere down the road it will be, but not at this junction in our history. I support war, and killing, when I believe it will prevent further war and killing. I do believe forcibly disarming Iraq, and destroying their WMD and chemical/biological weapons will prevent further killing. I also believe getting rid of Saddam and anyone loyal to him will prevent further war and killing. <br>
<br>
Am I a coward because I will not sign up to fight? Maybe in someone else's eyes, because cowardice, like bravery are subjective. To put it into terms I know everyone ont he rathe will understand. To a member of BoTS my Zlandicar's heart is probably not even good, let alone uber. To me however, it is REALLY uber, and my best item. A necro in BoTS might use it to solo because it has regen, but when grouping will use something 10000 x better. I will use it all the time because it is the best I have, and I think it is really super. So you see, bravery, cowardice, beauty, foulness, all these things depend on where in life you stand. <br>
<br>
Being in the military might make you braver than someone, but it does not make you brave. Furthermore, being in the military might not be considered brave to some, it might be considered foolish, so there is another angle to it. <br>
<br>
Basically all I am saying is, nothing is absolute, so don't be caught making these kinds of assumptions.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=liviusmaximus>LiviusMaximus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/2/03 1:28:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=147>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> Lukieb, how are you sure we used chemical weapons in Iraq? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vyxn>vyxn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/2/03 6:06:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=148>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> *throws sand against the wall*<br>

I'll use an oxymoron here... ever hear of military intelligence?  How about military linguists?  Cryptographers?  I do believe that some of these military jobs require years of learning.  Learning which is provided thru education.  Now just because the Navy doesn't allow jar headed ass clowns like you to do these certain jobs doesn't mean the whole military or the Marine Corps is less educated than someone with a PHD.

Volunteering for something may in itself be a somewhat brave act, but it by no means qualifies you for the act of bravery.  Actually doing something dangerous to help others for no personal gain or reward is both noble and brave.  Having spent 5 years in the US armed forces, I can for a fact tell you that people there are no more or less brave than people anywhere else.  There are fire fighters out there who lack bravery and police officers too.  What makes you think that military personnel are any different?  People are brave in many ways and risking your life does not have to be part of that equation.  Your &quot;I am a Marine hear me roar&quot; exuberence would be best left in your platoon and on the battle field (should you ever see one). Oh, and have some more respect for those you claim you are risking your life to protect.

<br>
FYI these were EXAMPLES used in a specific argument with a moron who was using existential reletavism to rebut my point he said doing things does not make 1 person&gt; than another...<br>
<br>
they are NOT absolutes you seem bright you should have figured that out...<br>
<br>
2 of the EXAMPLES I used to show Luki used the word  &quot; I &quot; <br>
<br>
 meaning a specific instance a person with a PHD  has more education than ME with a BA... a specific example <br>
<br>
 a person giving MORE percentage than ME is more generous than ME.... another specific example<br>
<br>
you then went on to compare apples to oranges...<br>
<br>
your arguments are all sound, articulate, well written and correct but...THEY'RE TOTALLY IRELEVENT TO THE ARGUMENT TAKING PLACE YOU BLOODFART ( OK this is where this post gets less tactful)<br>
<br>
most of what you said is TRUE but,.. it would be like if 2 people arguing about which was fastest a Corvette or a School bus and one person stated &quot; The Corvette is faster by far&quot; and you jumped in raving, &quot; YOU'RE SO WRONG JOE AN F16 FIGHTER  CAN GO MACH 3 AND IS MUCH FASTER THAN A CORVETTE&quot;<br>
<br>
while what you said was 100% factual YOU STILL COME OF SOUNDING LIKE A MORON<br>
<br>
If 2 people were debating the earths largets land animal and you chimed in with &quot;ALBERT EINSTEIN WORE SHOES&quot;<br>
<br>
while not being inncorrect you are still a DROOLING SHORT BUS KID LOOKING FOR ATTENTION BY TRYING TO BUTT INTO A CONVERSATION YOU'RE CLUELESS ABOUT<br>
<br>
Any disrespect in my previous post was aimed at Luki (and toric in a few) because of his spineless beliefs, which you would have gathered if you could COMPREHEND things you read in the context that they were written..<br>
<br>
FYI Pslee i've seen combat more than I would have ever hoped too or wish anyone to have to see<br>
<br>
 as far as you being in  &quot;the armed forces&quot; (lotsa pride in your branch there hardcharger) didn't ask didn't tell did you?<br>
<br>
and Land of the Lost was lame<br>
<br>
Yark, <br>
 I'd like a #3 meal with a coke supersize it please<br>

<br>
Faulty Logic? Bravery is an attribute which isn't clear cut. You may think you're brave because you join the army, and I might think i'm brave because I saved some kids life by snatching him before the car hit him. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sooooo happy for you and your belief that you're so brave....<br>
<br>
 Infact, I should go sign up for the army right now to out do you. Kudos to you Joe...... <br>
<br>
I have a question for you Joe. Have you ever served in combat, if so where and what was your job? Because then by your own admission, a Navy seal is braver than you, anyone who died for this country is braver than you.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
someone who volunteers for dangerous duties to spare his fellow man the risk of doing it is BRAVER than someone who won't do it or has to be forced to<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Not only that, but i'm supposed to take your word that you joined the army to support this nation and that you didn't join it in a time of peace just to get it on your resume?<br>
<br>
<br>
 So, you volunteered for the very reason I just quoted you with? What about those in the army who joined because they couldn't afford an education? <br>
<br>
Or how about those who joined because their life was in a downward spiral and they needed some kind of order restored?<br>
<br>
Just because someone was in the army does not make them brave or braver then anyone else. <br>
<br>
.......Your LOGIC is faulty.......<br>
<br>
 Martin Luther King Jr. never drew a gun, yet faced adversity. He was never in the armed forces and never took a violent outlook to solving problems. Many would call him brave. <br>
<br>
Again, your LOGIC is faulty because bravery instills itself in so many ways that you can not say that just because you served in the armed forces, you are braver than me........<br>
<br>
....and yes, i'd like to get a double whopper with cheese..plz drv tru danks!<br>

Why would a Marine be worth more than anyone else? Prove that you are so much better than, say.... a surgeon or scientist or the guy that refills the Slurpee machine at the 7-11 on my block.<br>
