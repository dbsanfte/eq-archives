Oh and I'm only expressing my views and Opinions and not that of my guildmates (tm) is that the disclaimer? Like i said first time posting here. <br>
<br>
Let me pose a question for you who were there.. Would you..really trick someone into...say cutting themselves with a knife while they were working on something, so you could then all benefit from it? If you said yes to this.. well go to hell x2 <br>
<br>
Now for the benefit of others saying.. wtf is he talking about.<br>
Last night CoN was setting up for Vindi and had been gathering for a while. A few yamabussi or however it's spelled zone in and ask about Vindi.. we stated we were massing for it. No word for awhile, and we are about to finish clearing last few to Vindi. Kenshiiro (guild leader?) &quot;pulling Vindi through right side of arena&quot; I didn't even notice they were there in force. Well I'm sure they got a laugh as we rushed ourselves to avoid BEING FU*KING WALKED ON YET AGAIN BY ANOTHER GUILD ..and pulled Vindi.. ya we had adds.. no we didn't split guards.. we haven't taken out Vindi yet, but know how to. <br>
<br>
Wipeout ensues..&quot;kenshiiro blubbers his apology profusely to our acting GM in tells.. (I sit next to the acting GM so I witnessed it). Something about they are Vindi noobs too, only killed him 2 times..Sorry for rushing us...never were intending to pull him. GM explained we were gathering again.. no problems, thanks for apology. I'm sure you can guess what's next?<br>
<br>
Ya they pulled him.. Killed him when we were 5min or less from pulling him. And Zeph you little bastard.. if you weren't like 12 with parental consent to play this game.. It would be a better place, lol &quot;You should thank us for saving you another CR&quot; FUC* YOU.. Did i mention this is only my view? not my guilds. Well it was like midnight eastern.. figured it was past bed time for the element we dealt with last night, never expected it.. but I try to play this game blind sometimes. Doesn't always work. <br>
<br>
<br>
First flame it kinda sucks.. rate me 1-10, maybe I'll post a followup. <br>

and Hey Aegu you can add to this, I know you have something cause you were there with us lol. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 616<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/5/02 12:32:41 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yamabushi</span><hr size=1> This has epic potential. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Once you have a force gathered, and preparing, the race is over. That's how the race idea works: first with force, has claim. Welcome to the Rathe. The *only* race mobs that work on the &quot;first to pull&quot; principle are those mobs that are out in wide open zones, Talendor, Gorenaire, Kal'orak Dar, etc. Mobs that require preparation and some measure of skill all work the same: first with force has claim. Venril, Trak, Velk, any mob of Vindi's level that you can think of that isn't an outdoor fight, falls clearly under that distinction. <br>
<br>
Just like a force in the cubby doesn't get walked over on the way to trak by another guild, there should be a level of common courtesy maintained for all raid level mobs. Considering Vindi, if anything, is a sight harder in terms of logistics and coordination, the conventions should be more strictly adhered to. I'd like to see SoY do anything with another guild rushing them along all the time, especially one who has had kill experience with the mob in question. <br>
<br>
I'm not surprised, though, some people's kids have never learned to share, the only unfortunate thing is that they've found each other in large enough numbers as to be inconvienent on the Rathe. <br>
<br>
Here's hoping that Bogfather's feelings about Kenshiiro are well deserved, to run over another guild like that takes a level of integrity far below what I've read about Kenshiiro in the past from someone whose opinons I value. <br>
<br>
So what's the deal here? You gank the mob or what? Try to not bring the &quot;kthx plz faggot&quot; people to the board, either. That only makes it look worse. <br>

<br>
But, there are no rules set for Vindi .. It's not whatever guild gathers in force first, get's the mob.  It's whatever force engages with the mob .. Pulling, would be considered engaging IMO with Vindi.<br>
<br>
But if they wiped the first time due to adds, SoY had every right to pull Vindi.  Even though they apologized in the first place, and they still didn't do anything wrong.  You failed, they pulled .. it happens often.  Remember the rogue that went in to Vox's layer when the raid party wiped out, and the rogue got a solo kill on vox, looted, and took off?   Did nothin wrong :/.<br>
<br>
It is unfortunate that assholes can get away with stupid stinky shit, but .. that's what assholes do.  <br>
<br>
Sorry to hear this happened to ya CoN, it was a really lame ass thing to do, i'm just trying to point out that they didn't do anything wrong by it either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seerfamily>Seer Family</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/5/02 1:57:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yamabushi</span><hr size=1> Well the nice thing to do would have been to help you with CR..and let you try again,...but..technically they did nothing wrong.<br>

I have witnessed them stepping aside on mobs for other guilds to try. i.e. Lodi one time when we had more than enough people to get the kill. We went after something else instead.<br>

We are not competing with BotS NB or TL for rotation space we are not even competing with FK LOL or LOM for that matter. We like to try some of the bigger stuff at times and this would of been our first real big effort at him. Vindi is tough mob for alot of guilds, timing has to be just right or theres a wipeout and its doubly important for us since we are not super experienced with him.

<br>
Well while I can sympathize with the frustration, after they had almost cleared teh camp, someone else pulled the named, and I certainly agree that isn't the normally accepted behaviour on this server.<br>
<br>
They died because of Kenshirro..no..they died because they tried to KS Kenshirro. And while that KS may have been justifiable...that wasn't Kenshirro's fault. They made the decision to rush before they were ready. They died because they attacked a mob they weren't ready for. That might have happened with or without Yama.<br>
<br>
So I reiterate, Yama engaged...Yama has the mob.<br>
<br>
However, this does appear to be a violation of the Rathe Agreement, even if it wasn't a violation of Verant rules. And in which case I should think rather than the flame board, this should be presented by the Guild Leader/Raid Leader of CON as a violation of the gentleman's agreement.<br>
<br>
Not much point to rotations, if you can't expect the other guilds to respect your camp.  (Deja Vu) <p>Caitsith  53 Mage<br>

<br>
Here is My side of this.  I zone into Kael /ooc camp check.  CoN calls Left Arena...thats all that was camped(i have log files to prove this).  So we head to right side of the arena, clear the Yard trash, then i /ooc Pulling Vindi through Right arena, be careful.  Then CoN only gives me a few replies like we are going to try him, etc.  What through me off was CoN was actually *IN* arena, as where normal farming is done, which is what i thought they were doing.  I have never seen Vindi pulled to that spot before last night, he is usually pulled to the corner by the bottom of the ramp.  <br>
<br>
In any case i dont argue after they tell me they want to take him, so we stood down.  Next thing i see is Vindi in arena at CoN camp, their SK pulled him..I /ooc GL CoN on Vindi...as you know they wiped out, I had one of my clerics(Fonina) go and rezz them.  Then i started talking to the CoN raid leader saying i never attempted to race them for Vindi, he said yeah we messed up by Rushing, etc.  5minutes later we pulled Vindi, Killed him.  CoN had their chance, I in no way wanted to rush them or steam roll them(for lack of a better term), thats not the way we operate.  So after they gave it their best, it was now our turn, there is nothing wrong in doing so.   Yes, i understood that CoN was disappointed, but I was not acting out of line, or trying to rush them in anyway.  I would never have went to the arena to Kill Vindi had I known CoN was there. <br>
<br>
I am sympathetic to CoN's situation, but dont distort the facts, we in no way forced you guys to pull, you didnt even send me a tell saying &quot;hey we are here for vindi, mind backing off, i would have said, yeah np i already told everyone that you guys are taking first shot at him, instead you rushed the pull *thinking* it was a race...<br>

CoN doing all the work is untrue, CoN pulled Vindi without splitting him from his guards.  so when SoY went for vindi, we had to split him from his guards as well as clear the usual arena garbage. <br>
<br>
They took their fair chance, then we took ours...that is all their is too it, this flame is uncalled for.<br>

<br>
Unless he is out and out lying, what I stated is factual.  <br>
<br>
CoN had a force massed to do Vindi.  They were proceeding to do so.  In a place of their choosing.<br>
<br>
Because they weren't in the &quot;proper&quot; place according to some, doesn't mean that they weren't processing the mobs. BotS (and SoT used to) pull KT to the Zone line.  TL and NB fight him at the Bridge.  To each their own.<br>

 No, incorrect.<br>
<br>
 We cleared to Vindi<br>
<br>
 We /OOC'd we were pulling Vindi, CoN objected.<br>
<br>
 We stood down so they could pull Vindi.<br>
<br>
 They wiped, we Cr'd them.<br>
<br>
 We split guards, pulled Vindi, Vindi went down.<br>
<br>
<br>
 In that order.<br>
<br>
   If CoN felt pressured to pull early that is unfortunate. That pressure may have come from our presence in the zone but most certainly did NOT come from our actions. We have never nor will we ever &quot;steamroll&quot; anyone. It's not how we do business.<br>

From the initial report, Kenshiiro knew that it was wrong what he did - he apologized - he did think it was his fault.  It wouldn't have happened without him there - CoN already said that.  Their premature pull was directly attributed to Kenshiiro.  <br>

They were not in the process of pulling his Guards.  When i /ooc it, i didnt know CoN wanted Vindi, and I was just standing in arena as i wouldnt be pulling him from his guards( i was just giving the 5min heads up to others), thats when without warning the SK tagged Vindi, then a Temple Guard popped on him as well. Both went to camp.<br>
<br>
We certainly not racing them for Vindi, just because thats what they were perceiving at the time, doesn't make it to be True.<br>
<br>
But you are correct, where they decide to fight Vindi is irrelavant. <br>

We were going over the  pull/fight tactics when someone from SOY started /ooc'ing about pulling Vindi out from under us.  Oh, wait, that was supposed to be funny?<br>
 What do you mean CON doing all the work is &quot;untrue&quot;? We had been clearing the path for a long time before anyone from SOY even showed up in zone.<br>
  You think we had 35 folks there for the sunshine and fresh air? <br>
  I *thought* that massing, preparing and advising was enough for these kinds of MOBS on The Rathe, at least that was my understanding from reading these boards.... shame on me, eh?  Even if it isn't written down in stone apparently some folks feel they are above common courtesy.  /sigh<br>
