In fact I've decided to take some time off, maybe a couple or months or so, and then make a decision as to whether I want to continue playing. In the meantime I've discovered BG2. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>It seems to me that, more or less since Velious came out, there has been a real greed problem on the server and it's ruining the high-level game. The recent changes to the planes certainly don't help, and I suppose Verant should address it, but I think the real issue is how we, the players, have been behaving given the world we find ourselves in (referring to Norrath).<br><br>I've heard lots of theories in-game as to the problem. Some people have pointed to a general influx of immature adolescents with the release of Velious, across all guild lines. Others point to the nature of the high-level zones themselves and the fact that the best loot can only be found on particular mobs (as opposed to, for example, being randomly spread out over several mobs). Others point to the fact that, sadly, the planes, for instance, don't allow multiple groups to coexist and pull in relative safety from each other. And, yes, many point to the actions of certain greedy inviduals, in certain guilds. It seems to me that all of these are valid, and there are likely quite a few more that could be added as well.<br><br>Well, we could rant forever on the shortcomings of EQ zones. And I think we all know just how much Verant cares about our opinions. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Unfortunately the screwed-up nature of some of these zones is totally out of our control and sadly there seems little chance that they will be made more multi-group/multi-guild friendly any time soon. So the rest of this post will concern with what we *can* deal with, the human factor.<br><br>First, some basic terminology. I've heard talk (not necessarily on this forum, more in-game) about greed, immaturity, rudeness, etc. Let's establish right up front that these are all separate (orthogonal?) concepts and can exist independently of one another (/em whacks engineer persona aside). Just want to be sure we are all on the same page.<br><br>Okay, first up. The calendar. I agree completely that, from a strictly rules-based point of view, it isn't official, specifically with regard to Verant's Play Nice Policies. It's more of a verbal treaty between some/most/all/all-but-one/take-your-pick guilds on the server. There is no in-game provision for persistent documents so all agreements are necessarily either verbal or out-of-game. However, having said this, it is also true that every guild on the server is aware of it, that it exists. Whether or not they have agreed to *follow* it is, to be true, another issue.<br><br>Ok, second. Following the calendar. Well, it seems to me that it's a pretty cut-and-dry issue. Your guild either has agreed to follow it or it hasn't. Kind of like the Kyoto treaty. Countries either ratify it or they dont. Yes, yes, you can't actualy *sign* something in-game, but you *can* on a website. I would submit that a list of *signatories* should have been obtained when the calendar was drawn up, hindsight being 20/20. At any rate, the point is, if your guild supports the treaty, you are bound by it and gain its benefits, but if you dont, then several things:<br><br>1.  you aren't subject to any of its restrictions<br>2.  you don't gain any of its benefits<br>3.  those who *are* bound by it can exert pressure on non-signatories to join<br><br>Let's go in order.<br><br>1. Non-signatories aren't subject to a treaty's restictions. If Legacy of Sorrow (hereafter referred to LoS) hasn't agreed to the calendar, so be it. Raid wherever and whenever you like, within the Play Nice Policies, of course. Nice and legal.<br><br>2. Non-signatories don't gain any of a treaty's benefits. If LoS hasn't agreed to the calendar, they can't post on it. Period. Cut-and-dry, as any enforceable treaty has to be.<br><br>3. Signatories can exert pressure on non-signatories to join. Countries do this as well. Economic sanctions (e.g. no member of this/these/all/take-your-pick signatory guild shall trade with members of this/these/all/take-your-pick non-signatory guilds, or shall only trade in food, medicine, etc., you get the picture).  Travel restrictions (not grouping with this/these/... non-signatory guilds). Basically, watch the news and you'll get the idea. Countries generally can't force things on another (major wars are actually somewhat rare, generally), so all they can do is exert pressure. Somewhat similar to EQ. And remember, exerting pressure only works if done in its entirety, just as pressure on countries only works if done on the whole of the country rather than on only some of its citizens. It's always sad to &quot;punish&quot; innocents in countries to try to get change from their governments, but that's the only way it can ever work...<br><br>Ok *deep breath* just what does all this mean to all of us? Well...<br><br>Countries sign treaties. We can as well. We can post them on luclin.com and list guilds that have agreed to abide by them. The establishment of the calendar is a treaty. Alliances between guilds are treaties. And yes, sanctions are treaties. Make a &quot;treaties&quot; section and list them. If we want a calendar, have someone draft it and get guilds to sign it. Alliances, sanctions, etc., same thing. Each guild can decide on its own how to ratify it, much like a country. The US uses a vote in the Senate (if I remember correctly), whereas other countries use other methods. Some may not even vote on it. The method guilds use really doesn't matter, as long as they choose something that's official.<br><br>Okay, in this post there has been some charged language: greed, immaturity, rudeness, and the real one, &quot;sanctions&quot;. I don't want to paint with a broad brush, so I'm going to proceed slowly.<br><br>The first three can honestly cross any guild line. When making statements about individuals one has to be *very* careful not to generalize to the group. This applies to *any* group: race, religion, nationality, guild, etc. The only statement I will make is that it's out there, just like in real life, and we have to deal with it. Aside from that, this post really isn't about those things, when relating to *individuals*. So you'll not be seeing any flames on individual LoS members here. Period. I don't know them individually any more than I know anyone in Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, China, etc. So that's that.<br><br>Those terms *can*, however, be applied to *certain* (and only certain) groups of individuals, in a limited fashion. And I mean this in the sense, really, of *policy*. For instance, one *might, for example* make the statement that China is acting rudely and greedily. In fact this would apply to the policy of the People's Republic of China, as set by its leaders, and not to it's citizens, per se. I would submit, however, that if such a statement about a country were the case, then it would *by definition* apply to the policymakers. In this specific sense I think you may apply some such terms to guilds, depending on their behavior, and once again, this refers to the guild's *policy*, which is usually evidenced by its behavior (like countries).<br><br>Yes, I know, this is taking forever. So here's the point. If we want a calendar let's draft a treaty, sign it, and *post it*, including and especially the signatories. If we want to pressure a guild (in this case LoS) into agreeing as well, then draft a treaty to actually do something about it, sign it, and *stick to it*. Or not, as is your choice. If it's really that bad, then get the guild leaders on Luclin to impose sanctions. No grouping. No trading. Whatever. At any rate, I would submit that a guild that doesn't sign the calendar treaty should *not* gain its benefits. This is important. Otherwise the treaty is meaningless. That means, for example, if a signatory reserves PoF, and LoS (presumably a non-signatory) is already there, the signatory should *raid anyway and request spawn sharing*. Petition if you have to, but get your raid. Enforce the treaty. That's the only way that treaties work. If there are sanctions, *enforce them*. No need to start a guildwar, it's just too destructive. Countries don't go to war over every little thing either. There are other optons. Sanctions is one of them. Tariffs is another, lesser option, for instance; an EQ equivalent could be a charge (or surcharge) on services rendered to certain guilds. The point is, just as with countries, reputation (or lack thereof) only goes so far. There is a range of avenues at guilds' disposal if they have the will to follow through with it.<br><br>Anyway, that's all I've got to say. Just some thoughts. Frankly I'm so disillusioned at some of the in-game behavior that the thought of playing sickens me at this point...maybe in the summer I'll feel differently but that's neither there nor here.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushamanarriana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaman Arriana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/20/01 3:07:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=727.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on all this LoS business (long post)</span><hr size=1> Well, seems reasonable to me...<br><br>LoS doesn't believe in the calender...<br><br>ergo<br><br>LoS should not be able to post on the calender<br><br>No cake-and-eat-it-too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukegas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kegas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/20/01 4:07:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=727.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on all this LoS business (long post)</span><hr size=1> Not allowing them to post only wastes other people's time.<br><br>If LoS plans on doing Hate on the 23 it benefits all of us to have them post that so we don't waste our time trying to build a force to go to hate.<br><br>The only way we could penalize them for not being part of the list is to not let them view the list.

The calendar works fine for the folks who follow it, but it biggest weakness is that it's has absolutely no teeth. Verant doesn't recognize it, powerful guilds don't respect it so we reach a situation where someone can do whatever they want. That's the reason why I don't get frustrated about the issue cause you're just beating your head against the wall. Is it fair or right, is debatable cause obviously there are those who I honestly feel that the calendar infringes upon their right to play the game when, where, and how they want to. I think there has to be compromise but unless all parties are in agreement then it becomes pointless. Sorry to be pessimistic but that's how things are. We can draw up as many rules and regulations to our hearts content but unless verant supports it then everything becomes moot.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueqfranko.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQFranko </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dragon chew toy</span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/20/01 10:57:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=727.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on all this LoS business (long post)</span><hr size=1> WE've been dealing with conflicts in philosophy since the onset of our server.

No.  Look on TV/magazines/advertising/etc when you see someone supporting Breast cancer research, child abuse funds, etc etc etc.  99% of those people support those funds because THEY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY IT.  The rest (i.e. majority) of us just go on with our lives because we don't give a rats ass--it doesn't affect us.  <br><br>Example:  Doug Flutie with his Flutie Flakes.  Money he makes from that goes to support Autism.  Why?  Because he has autistic children!  Same with Dan Marino, who also supports research in this area.<br><br>Another good example--The US didn't really get involved in WWII until it began affecting us.  Yes we were sending supplies during the war, but we weren't truly fighting it.  Then when the U-Boats started sinking our supply ships, and when Pearl Harbor happened, we started fighting.  Many even believe that we knew days prior to the bombings of Pearl Harbor that the Japanesse were on their way.  But FDR knew that a war would help to end the depression.  3 out of 4 Americans were jobless at this time. A war would cause men to take up arms and fight for their country, women to take up jobs, companies to begin manufacturing bombs, planes, guns, etc.  It would cause the US to work as a whole.

Countries are able to put economic trade sanctions on other countries because the affected countries NEED their trade. With all due respect, LoS is largely self efficient. <br><br>What happens when NATO and/or the UN place trade restrictions on a country? Sometimes it works and the country submits to the pressure, and sometimes it doesn't. However, when the country does submit, it is because it cannot survive without imports/exports from other countries, whether it be oil, computers, etc. <br><br>However, in the world of EQ, where all resources are open to everybody, it's different. LoS has access to all the resources they need. They're pretty self-sufficient, and at this point, they've probably been pushed so far away from the rest of the server that they wouldn't give a damn if people stopped trading/grouping with them. <br><br>I would submit that in the world of EQ, guilds are not like countries competing against one another, with different resources, but more like corporations in a single country, all with the same opportunities and resources. <br><br>Sounds nice, and might even be worth it even if it was just a symbolic gesture. But you wouldn't be able to get 100% participation, and even if you did, you would just end up with an isolated LoS killing everything before you just logged on out of spite anyhow... Not a good situation = / <br><br>Call me a pessimist, but I don't really believe there is anything anyone can really do at this point, except maybe form an anti-LoS guild, but I don't know if there are people that are as hardcore in LoS in terms of playing time, style, and skill to do that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uveladorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veladorn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 453<br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/21/01 9:35:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=727.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://yourpage.blazenet.net/anabelle/triad/valasclose2.jpg width=150 hieght=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sounds great in theory...</span><hr size=1> I think lots have the skills but I will agree nobody is as hardcore.

As much as people talk about any sort of penalty to be put on LoS, put bluntly there's nothing you can really do to them that won't get you banned.<br><br>And honestly, how many guilds on this server could really put up a fight if LoS decided to come in and take whatever NPC your raid was after?  Apex, Triad, maybe IB, with a very slight chance of Heroes if LoS didn't send too massive of a force.  That's it.<br><br>The best policy I've found in dealing with LoS is to treat them with respect.  Period.  With the exception of Neku, they will generally treat you with respect in return.  And Neku I honestly think is sometimes just too bogged down in dealing with crap to be nice.  Considering how many random flames he gets per night, I probably wouldn't be too pleasant to people outside of my own guild either.<br><br>I.E. play nice policy works, but NOT if you treat them like complete slime for no reason whatsoever.  And while some of you may have legitimate gripes, unfortunately that's how the game works.
