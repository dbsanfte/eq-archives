<br>
After the past week's happenings both here on the RTA and in game regarding my guild's killing of Named Drakes in HoT, I have a few things to say. I probaly can't find the right way to express this as I have so many thoughts bouncing in my head. Let's see if I can get my thoughts across to you  and hope this time I am understood.<br>
<br>
It's always difficult to post on the RTA boards...there's a fear you'll be flamed for typing a wrong character on a keyboard. Remember when you were a kid and you saw someone do or say something wrong and the entire school yard participated in a hazing of sorts? Pfft you people do that here too over the stupidest things...but I digress.<br>
<br>
So my guild, Shadows of Yamabushi, was farming in HoT in Doze's area. Named drakes were up...we were excited. We killed them. We had a good time, too. <br>
<br>
The next night havoc wreaked throughout Norrath. Who the hell killed the nameds in HoT?? It was so and so, no it was so and so...blah blah blah. <br>
<br>
So the week went on with battles of words and ideas here on the RTA. For me it didn't stop here. It continued in game. Friends of mine from guilds on the Doze Rotation had it out with me. Talked to me like I didn't appreciate the Rotations and Calendar system here on The Rathe.<br>
<br>
Why is it that no one seems to understand what I was saying?<br>
<br>
I as a member of The Rathe community support the Rotations. I as a member of Shadows of Yamabushi, a Senior officer too, support and enforce the Rotations and Calendar system established by The Rathe Community.<br>
<br>
My postings here in response to the Doze issue was to say, &quot;hey there are rules for these mobs? What are they so we can follow them&quot; In return I got you should just ask what the long standing gentlemen's agreements are. I disagreed (and still do because why would I think to ask BoTs or Noble Blade about the Named Bixie in Misty Thicket?) So with my postings (along with others) some agreements have been drafted for viewing here on the RTA. I am happy about that.<br>
<br>
Within that thread things branched off to why should people follow these gentleman's agreements made by the first few guilds to take these mobs out and to why the &quot;lesser guilds&quot; benefit from the &quot;uber guilds&quot; sharing of these mobs. In addition, people discussed why certain mobs were together on a rotation...people both agreed and disagreed. We also talked about who comes up with these agreements and who gets to add to these discussions or in the end not.<br>
<br>
Where am I going with this? Well, I'm posting to say that just because I wanted (still want) to see these gentleman's agreements in writing doesn't mean that my guild doesn't or that I don't support the Rathe Rotation and Calendar System. Do I know that my guild benefits from these systems? Yes I do and damn sure as hell don't need to be continually told this by the uber guilds or my so called &quot;friends&quot; in those guilds. I am grateful for these Rotations as are many other of the guilds of the same level as SoY.<br>
<br>
I am also here to tell you that I am not trying to ruffle anyones feathers about the Rotation guidelines. Do I want to sit and talk with you about each and every guideline that I have no clue about? No. Do I want to know what they are? Yes. I was asking who gets to discuss these things? Who comes up with the guidelines...can they be changed? I wasn't trying to say now that my guild has killed X mob once, let's sit and have a beer and make new guidelines.<br>
<br>
So with that being said, I hope in the future should issues such as this come up again we can openly talk about them without pointing fingers but maturely coming to an informative conculsion in the end.<br>

<br>
I disagreed not with your comment but someone elses comment that rules for each rotation should be up for review for the entire community, if you arent involved or done xxx you dont have the knowledge to place your 2cp.<br>
<br>
I dont think anyone should be yellin or harassing you for your statement, in or out of game.<br>
<br>
Your friends on the Doz rotation should let thier guild leaders deal with it. If you ever feel harassed or &quot;pressured&quot; by anyone let thier guild leader, one of the admins know. One of the vertues (sp) we aspire here is leave it here dont bring it to game. 3-6k of people and 70+ guilds are never going to agree to everything but we should all learn to do our best to make life easy on everyone.<br>
<br>
As for Ezboard expert I may have a couple Qs for you later i am just now getting usedd to it and been playing with the controls , if you reloaded the page yesterday between 4-7pm EST you would have noticed the color scheme went from yellow/black, pink and blue and 100 other revisions till I found something soft on the eyes but not dry. Somoene actually liked the plain black and white look but it totaly looked dull to me. <p><p><img src="http://www.lvcm.com/hasse/vincesig.jpg" align="left">Vincecross Dhark'baen 60 Warlock  <br>Vincecrs Dhark'baen 52 Warrior<br>
