i didn't know that i was so respected to be called Mr. Anon.... LOL<br>
anyways, i must disagreed with Liv, since there is no possible way to pull a named Frenzy spider from the far back wall near the other Faked wall.  and i take back the stealing part, cuz it ain't stealing until after the mob is aggroed.  Plus, Velks sometimes is so packed, that it is near impossible to pull. then, to see Frenzy pulling mobs from downstairs, well then, im going to take a mob or 2 (no more) from that far end.  I only think that it is fair.<br>
<br>
Also, i don't know if Bogardan realizes this, but when u pull 3 or 4 mobs, unless u physically hit all of them, they sometimes like to aggro onto people that u r running by. OH WAIT! in your upper wiser and respected caste, u would know all that! im sorry....this no count will be quiet now =p<br>
<br>
And as for me posting anon, i chose to this, not cuz i &quot;lack the balls&quot;, but cause i can expression an opinion and not hear BS /tells in game =p<br>
<br>
BTW, Bogardan, your biggest problem is that u continue to put your foot in your own mouth.  Your arrogance is your biggest problem. your shouts for groups r horrible. &quot;60 Crusader LF competent group&quot;-PLEASE! i sometimes feelin like shouting &quot;60 incompetent Crusader LF competent group 2 make up for incompetency&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, i do agreed with Bogardan on one point. one hit to break mez will not be enough to pull mob off the chanter.  i know this from playing tank/mez breaker and i have been bitched out lots of times for not breaking mez properly.<br>
<br>
that is it for me =p<br>

All made by Bogardarn Hopeseeker.<br>
<br>
*********<br>
It is a sad sight when those of a lower caste in the society that is The Rathe try to dig a cave from which to leap into the world of those who are wiser and more experienced than them.<br>
*********<br>
<br>
So you are freely admitting there that this person should keep his mouth shut cause you believe him to be in a lower &quot;caste&quot;? A lower caste compared to who? you? What groundbreaking accomplishments have you done to make you higher on the &quot;caste&quot; system? I do not recall seeing your name recorded in any great historical accomplishments in EQ. <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and if ya mention all the things your guild is doing, it is a little selfish that &quot;one&quot; should take the credits where many sacrifice just as much as you do, and in most cases perhaps much more than what you bring to the table. For everything you have done my friend someone else has done before you, either on the Rathe or on any other server.<br>
<br>
************<br>
Nice attempt, but I'm afraid your insignificant status in the game remains.<br>
************<br>
<br>
Maybe I am old fashion, or maybe just because I am an American, I believe in a little something called &quot;equality&quot;. I treat everyone with respect and I normally get it back tenfold. <br>
<br>
As for him be insignificant, looks like alot of people reading this thread do not find him as &quot;insignificant&quot; as you wish him to be.<br>
<br>
I have many friends in many guilds, and I was not present at the &quot;event&quot; when it took place. So I am not flaming guilds or putting my 2cp in regards who is right and who is wrong in Velks. What I AM upset at is a guy comes here and basicly says because the guy is &quot;beneath him&quot; in their station of EQ life, his complaint should not even be addressed.<br>
<br>
I know many people who have never been to Western Wastes cause the mobs there will kill them, I know guilds who make a massive 40+ man run at epic mobs that I have seen guilds like BoTS, TL, and SoT kill with a group of 6 or 9 people. Are they beneath us? No @#%$ way!! <br>
<br>
So, I must be beneath ya cause even though I got to see Vulak dead at my feet, I still run and help these &quot;insignificant&quot; people and guilds (in your eyes at least) with whatever aid I can give.<br>
<br>
Be safe all.<br>

You do train people remember in In the Grey with a Champions of Norrath group twice you tried to steal our camp!  Hmm one time with Oyam you KS a named from us.  <br>
<br>
The next time you were with someone named Sindri who fears stuff then you root it then tell us to attack.  Then when the root broke it would go after Sindri and he claimed we were training him.  Then he had the gall when I asked him if he was ok to say that the bard in the group was charming the mobs and sicking them on him.  What a newb.  I was the bard first of all and I was chatting with him.  Also anyone knows you cannot charm a mob and sick it on someone unless you are dueling. <br>
<br>
I think its looking like Tindi has a bad element.  No one would even help either with all the @#%$ that happened.  We spoke to the GM of Tindi and he did absolutely nothing.  Now I hate to say this as I have a lot of friends in Tindi.  Anyone who knows me will vouch that I am not nor will I ever be someone who trains or tries to screw with someone.  Falden is in Tindi and knows me well.<br>
<br>
You better check yourself Tindi you guys are getting a bad rep.  Theres no room for the attitudes I have seen displayed by your members thus far.  Excluding my good friend Falden and some others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubrumpybronzefinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brumpy Bronzefinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tad-pole</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/1/02 9:56:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=377.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.synmicro.com/prod/itempics/jiveman.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Bogardarn the training ass, and trained monkey.</span><hr size=1> This is a joke right?

Intentionally breaking a mez mob of a group your not in is the most sorry-assed thing anyone can do...<br>
<br>
My group gets extra adds, by whatever means, and I mez them...I have grouped with enough people, including Boga, for them to know that if they break my mez and don't do it properly, I get smacked around (which, at our levels is annoying as hell). This is regaurdless of who has cause any damage. I have had Jerry &quot;OMG Ima Wizzyman&quot; Clueless nuke a mezzed mob with IC and it stomp my brains out.<br>

<br>
-was in Frenzy for 2 hours, there was also a FW group.<br>
<br>
-I found it very hard to find more than 1 or 2 mobs at a time, but I finally got 4 spiders on me. So I run down to FW group with my 4 spiders. I stand there with them hitting on me, FW group is looking at me but nothing happened. Guess what??? The spiders did not agro FW group. So I ran back up to frenzy so my group could kill em.<br>
<br>
-conclusion: for spiders to agro off one PC to another, the 2nd PC must do something to cause the agro, such as attack or cast on the mobs. Bogardan mentioned you were mezzing mobs as he passed by. Since he is a pally and can't FD, he can't really train you. <br>
<br>
I have no doubt you and Bogardan were arguing over mobs and more than likely he was pulling mobs from the FW &quot;area&quot; or from lower down. Since you show in your post you mezzed mobs and Bog says get off, it honestly does not look like a train to me. I still see no proof of a train and I would break mezzes on mobs I had pulled if some chanter not in my group did that. That would explain your death.<br>
<br>
What I feel Bog is guilty of is being elitist(sp?) in his first post, which he should appologize for. He prolly also took mobs from FW area, rude but not terrible. He also did not handle his confrontation with you very well, Alistiwen (sp?). For these things Bog should appologize.<br>
<br>
What I feel he is not guilty of is training you. Being that its very hard to do and your log offers no proof of a &quot;train&quot; occurring. Intentional training is a very serious thing. I have spoken with Bog and he assures me he did not train you, yet you insist he did. Offer me real proof, your log shows no train, just that Bog attacked a mezzed mob that very well could have been his pull in the first place. <br>
<br>
I am defending Bog on the train issue. I am an officer of Tindi, the guild Bog is in. Give me some real proof that a train occured and something will be done. If you have no proof then STFU! <p><CENTER><img src="http://www.execulink.com/~kevt/Uthur.jpg">

<br>
n00b question #11 here but how do you prove training in a log?  Other than someone going &quot;I trained you muhahahaha&quot;.  You can't disprove that he did train in a log either.  That has got to be one of the stupidest arguments I've ever heard.  Ahh...but then I'm not in the upper caste... <br>

The reason the spiders aggro'd my group was because we already had spiders on us. You being a member of Tindi'Losi must know that when you have one npc and you run by a similar npc the new npc will aggro. Let me give you an example. You know those little fire beetle things in west freeport? You can walk by them and they wont hit you because they are indif, but as soon as you hit one of them the other ones will aggro you if you get close enough. Same thing with giant wasp drones in Greater Faydark. You see, Bogardarn ran into our group with the spiders watched them aggro, dissapeared for a time (or he may have been there, I was running around trying to mez adds) and then came back when all the spiders had stopped moving and started hitting them.<br>
<br>
Next time read the facts presented before you make a lame ass post like that. Im sure you had good intentions and all, but see when you do an experiment, it has to be scientific, and you can go look up what that means whenever.  <br>
<br>
Corso, there may not be any evidence he trained us, because there is no way any log or even a screenshot unless it followed him from where he got the mobs to the camp to where he left them, (and then some moron would be screaming, that's fake or those pictures aren't even from the same time yada yada). I saw him do it, the log proves SOMEONE trained us. Bogardarn saying dont take my mobs and then breaking all the mezzes suggests that either A) he was reffering to npcs he had pulled earlier and was doing this in spite, or B) was trying to cover up his breaking of the mezzes with some punk ass excuse that only a gimp would believe. <br>
<br>
Im sorry, it's nice that the Tindi's show up in force when one of their members is an ass, but at least make a valid point. Right now Im thinking Bogardarn might not be a unique element.... <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/calalis.jpg"</img> <br>

WHERE IN THIS LOG IS THERE AN OBVIOUS POINT WHERE HE TRAINED YOU?????   I DONT SEE IT.  I SEE YOUR PULLER SAY HE HAS A TRAIN, BUT THATS ABOUT IT.  I see him telling you to GTFO his mobs, because im guessing you people are stealing his things.  <br>
<br>

Take a look at the seconds between your mez breakings:  37, 03, 21, and 49.  Now i may be a druid BUT ive also been in groups, IF SOMEONE IS BRAKING MEZES I DONT THINK IT TAKES HIM OVER A MINUTE TO BREAK FOUR IN A SMALL CONFINED AREA.  <br>
<br>
And no, im not sticking up for him because hes a member of my guild, as i said i dont give a @#%$, All i want to do is to PROVE that you are trying something sneaky.<br>

I think its looking like Tindi has a bad element. No one would even help either with all the @#%$ that happened. We spoke to the GM of Tindi and he did absolutely nothing. Now I hate to say this as I have a lot of friends in Tindi. Anyone who knows me will vouch that I am not nor will I ever be someone who trains or tries to screw with someone. Falden is in Tindi and knows me well.<br>
<br>
You better check yourself Tindi you guys are getting a bad rep. Theres no room for the attitudes I have seen displayed by your members thus far. Excluding my good friend Falden and some others. ---Aeguvas<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Aeguvas, the incident with Einhander and Sindri happened when Luclin first came out in early December. There were no such things as camps in The Grey since most of the zone consists of wanderers. It's one large open area and the only mobs which could accidentally be trained are undead, since they aggro the nearest PC. I know what I'm talking about because I was getting 1 AA point a day in the Grey back when there were 5 people tops in the zone at peak times.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to now, 2 months apart from the previous incident and a NEW recruit, Bogardan, is being accused of training the Fake Wall camp without proof.  I have pulled in Velks for Frenzy, and many other camps, with both my druid and rogue and NEVER have my pulls latched onto the Fake Wall group or ANYONE I pull past for that matter. If they did, chances are I'd go back down and take my mobs back. This MAY have possibly been what Bogardan did. Then again you MAY have seen Frenzy pulling from outside their camp and thought you would take some mobs via mez since the zone was crowded.<br>
<br>
No one knows for sure but since you died you decided to take the childish route and storm to the flames board to let the wolves at Bogardan even though you may not be completely innocent yourself.<br>
<br>
Obviously both of you were wrong because a) Bogardan didn't come to the boards and flame and you had no conclusive evidence behind your post/log and b) the guides did nothing. Both parties move on and forget it because its stupid.<br>
<br>
<br>
Back to Aeguvas....<br>
<br>
Tindi has a bad element and attitude?<br>
GLs of Tindi did nothing?<br>
We're getting a bad rep?<br>
<br>
First of all when someone comes to us with a complaint regarding one of our members we don't say &quot;Ok&quot; and go on with our gaming. We talk to the person(s) accused and find out their side of the story and give them warnings where applicable. In extreme cases /guildremoving is an option. Just because we do not /guildremove what could be a great member over a small incident does not mean we support training and killing puppies.<br>
<br>
Not every guild is perfect and believe it or not but you can't hold every member's hand every minute of everyday. We have about 120 casual to active members and 3 of those have been complained about in the last 2 months.<br>
<br>
Does this mean the other 117 members will train you, have a &quot;bad element&quot; and bad attitude? Hell no.<br>
<br>
So....Aeguvas, please stop trying to lay immature label's on entire guilds where its obviously not applicable. Tindi is a great guild and I'm sure many will agree but, as I said, no one is perfect. Yes, this means your guild is also not perfect but we don't troll the boards pointing out it's flaws.<br>
<br>
Take your lame reputation bashing a'ss elsewhere. You are in no place to preach what an entire guild's reptuation is to the rest of the Rathe. S'hit gets start by people like you who spend more time on boards like these instead of enjoying yourself ingame.<br>
