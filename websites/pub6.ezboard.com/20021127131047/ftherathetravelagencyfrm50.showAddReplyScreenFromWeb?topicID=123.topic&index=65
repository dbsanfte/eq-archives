WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> Ok things we know<br>
<br>
1) A Ntov Guild wont go into NTov until full spawn<br>
2) A full spawn can take more than 48hrs in some instances.<br>
3) Eash and Ik can spawn before ALL mobs in Ntov are up.<br>
4) NTov guild will have a pretty good idea when their up and when mobs are due to spawn.<br>
5) Aary currently must be killed before your on NTov Rotation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So maybe it should go something like this?<br>
<br>
<br>
1) You cannot kill Ik and/or Eash if Aary and Feshak are not up. (to try to avoid the slow respawns in Ntov)  Maybe even add Vyemm to that list of must be up.<br>
<br>
2) Every other of your attempts at Ik and Eash you MUST attempt Aary.<br>
<br>
3) You cannot kill Ik and/or Eash more than once consecutively. You must &quot;wait&quot; 1 spawn before you can try again. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This should stop Farmers / snipers but still give the Ntov guilds SOME spawns on Ik and Eash but not exclusive it will also give the smaller guilds a go at Ik and Eash.<br>
<br>

<br>
there's really no reason to make anything more complicated than need be.<br>
<br>
Up to now, the NToV rotation was all mobs past the Door.<br>
<br>
I can't really see any reason for that to change, or more rules put into place, or &quot;watchdogs&quot; assigned to make sure that all the rules are being adhered to.<br>
<br>
Any guild that can get up a Raid force to successfully get to Iki and Eashan can probably take down Aary, and be part of the NToV rotation.<br>
<br>
It all comes down to courtesy.  There is a NToV rotation, which is all mobs past the Door.  Because of the way VI wanted timers on each individual mob in a zone, NToV can spawn weirdly.  Up to now, all Rotation Guilds waited until Full Spawn before going in.  Up to now, a guild got onto the Rotation by killing Aary, which has, up to now, included Iki and Eashan.  There doesn't seem to be any reason to change things *at this time*.<br>
<br>
That is not to say things can't change in the future.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udarkoak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarkOak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Blade</span><br>  Posts: 451<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/18/02 1:18:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ntov</span><hr size=1> All I can say is.. if you don't have some damn good monks.. good luck with the rampage drakes/wyverns.

As well, cohing into ntov would require that your entire raid force be +CoV aligned, and your mage would need to be +GoV (guardians of veeshan). Have fun.<br>

<br>
Umm no, that isn't what is being said at all, Granite.  <br>
<br>
Let me make it simple for you:<br>
<br>
No one cares about what you want to try.. no one is telling you what you can't try to pull.  What THEY are saying is if someone can actually killy Ikky/Eash then they likely want a shot at Aary.. and if they don't, they are sniping.<br>
<br>
No one is being greedy, but they want to prevent being taken advantage of. These two mobs are part of the NToV rotation, and until someone can KILL THEM that isn't on the rotation kills them.. it's a moot point.<br>
<br>
The current NTOV rotaters don't want them split, you want it to be considered... fine, when you can or have *KILLED* Ikky/Eash.. maybe they will be more inclined to listen to your concern.<br>
<br>
Their only other point was that if you CAN kill both, you likely have a decent shot at Aary.<br>
<br>
What part of a tin-foil hat wearing conspiracy are you driving at?<br>

I felt that no one should have the right to take away your &quot;chance&quot; at killing a mob. <br>
<br>
It seems to be the general idea here that &quot;no one is saying that you can not &quot;attempt&quot; the mob even though you can kill it&quot;.  Rules are here and in place to protect everyone, big and small.  When people say &quot;no one is telling you that you can't attempt them&quot; are they missing the whole peer pressure issue??  Isnt that what the RTA is all about?  If it is deemed sniping by the 3 guilds that control NToV then the whole rathe would be behind them when it came up on the flame board.  A guild that attempted and won against them then left NToV would be poo'd on for a long time.  Granted this would be in violation of the current &quot;agreement&quot; and I understand that.  That is why I asked would it be possible to move the rotation to start at Aar.  <br>
<br>
With that said I am wondering though how can you say that it would be wrong and unfair to you and that I would be withholding your mob from you and taking away 14.3% of YOUR raid when you wouldn't even consider allowing others to ATTEMPT them unless they can clear NToV.  Because they are YOUR mob's YOU earned them by clearing NToV right? <br>
<br>
I can understand your comparision about taking  NB into Fear and clearing the tentacles.  I never once said I am against the rotations or protected mobs, I do understand this.  I understand that the GM's from NB, Tindi and BotS OWN those mobs and its their call if they want to share those 2 with others without holding them to clearing NToV, they have voiced their opinion and the law stands as it was.   I will not attempt them unless I am leading a guild that is capable of clearing all of NToV, those are the rules that were set up by the Rathe and as being part of the community I will respect those rules, but I will also question them as I feel is my right.<br>
<br>
I got my answer before and responded to it.  I don't agree with holding back mobs that people are capable of killing, that was it.  I dropped it because the argument was going no where and I got the impression that the majority didn't agreed with me.   Thats fine I can handle that.<br>
<br>
We each have our seperate views on this issue.   I can live with that, sometimes you can't agree with everyone around you, sometimes you can't control others, should you hate them then or try to hurt them by belittling them?  Or should you still respect them and their views while holding strong to that which you value?  Well thats up to you.<br>
<br>
I would like to thank all of the other posters who were cool, forthcoming and open in their responses in this discussion.<br>
<br>
On a last note I never once brought into this conversation the idea or theology of &quot;I pay 12.95 a month to play for a game I will kill what I want.&quot;  Never once did I say that or infer that.  I was talking about what I felt was a basic right of people.  Please do not put words into my mouth, suggest you know what I am thinking, or suggest I would resort to saying that.  That is rude and uncalled for.  Yes that rotation has been going on for a year like that, but as was brought up on another thread a year ago only 4 guilds were capable of killing named in ToV. <p><center><BR><font color= Blue><BR><i>Granitfist/Jeribu<i/><BR><i>GrandMaster/High Priest<i/><BR><i>Co-Leader of Circles End<i/><BR><i>The Rathe<BR><center><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370733">The Monk </> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370756">The Cleric<i/>

____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Just wanted to point out your righteous indignation has no business in this thread.  You did, in fact, infer the “$12.95 a month” argument, even if you didn’t get to the part of the argument that involves spelling out where this “basic right” that you speak of, comes from..  Where *does* this “basic right” for engaging mobs come from?  It comes from the argument that we all pay/play this game together and the “you’re not the boss of me” type attitude you display so brilliantly.  Your claim to have not inferred this is incorrect at best.  I’m not suggesting that I know what you were thinking, nor am I putting words if your mouth.   I am pointing out that this IS the source of the point you are making.  That we are somehow removing your “basic right” (gotten from where please?) to kill what you want when you want, and so we should change our rotation to suit your desires.<br>
<br>
Secondly, where you got the idea I was rude to you is beyond me, as I have been nothing but civil to you.  If you would prefer to see what rude looks like, I guess we can go there, but it looks much different and isn’t necessary.  All I have stated were my answers to your questions and trying to get you to understand things from my perspective, which you are still having a hard time doing.  Your responses all give lip service to “ya ya, I understand that, but why can’t I get what I want?” (paraphrased)  You talk on and on about how nice the Rathe is, and rotations are great things, and then lament that you can’t just disregard them or change them to suit you (and others), when you aren’t even on the rotation in question.  It shows no understanding at all, frankly.  Read my Fear example again, and put yourself in my place.  How would you feel if someone came and took some of &quot;your&quot; mobs before you got to Fear? <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

2.  If you can kill Ikatair/Eashen, you can probably kill Aaryonyar.  Why not give it a shot and get onto the ToVN rotation?  So, you may have to coffin after it but it is still good experience just to even attempt him.  You'll have to coffin if you fail Ikatair or Eashen anyway so it isn't that big of a risk.<br>

<br>
As far as the fear issue.  Can NB kill every mob in Fear?  Yes they can, are they allowed to? Yes they are.  Can other guilds out there right now kill Ikatair/Eashen? Yes than can.  If they can't clear NToV are they allowed to? No they aren't.  Because they are part of a &quot;big package&quot; rotation.<br>
<br>
But as some have pointed out this does not involve me in any way atm, I am sorry for trying to prove that I thought I was in the right about.  I think that some very stubborn people come here and I am definitley one of them.   I have a hard time giving up or in, its my nature.   Karadin, you were trying to get me to understand your view and I was trying to get you to understand mine.  I see that on this issue that will most likely never happen.<br>
<br>
Gromm when you made your point of number #3 about even if you attempt Aar and fail no one will say one word about sniping.  One of the things that started my motor running was in your first post where you said &quot;Note that 'sniping' Ikatair and Eashen and then suiciding on Aaryonyar so that your guild can claim they were simply unsuccessful in entering the rotation is considered a 'bad thing'.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am done posting on this though for I feel all that will come of it is more hard feelings and misunderstandings.  All when I am suppose to play this game for fun, relaxation and enjoyment. <p><center><BR><font color= Blue><BR><i>Granitfist/Jeribu<i/><BR><i>GrandMaster/High Priest<i/><BR><i>Co-Leader of Circles End<i/><BR><i>The Rathe<BR><center><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370733">The Monk </> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370756">The Cleric<i/>

As far as the fear issue. Can NB kill every mob in Fear? Yes they can, are they allowed to? Yes they are. Can other guilds out there right now kill Ikatair/Eashen? Yes than can. If they can't clear NToV are they allowed to? No they aren't. Because they are part of a &quot;big package&quot; rotation.<br>

<br>
I'm sure there are guilds out there that are capable of killing some of the mobs in Fear but arent on the rotation.  You have to prove yourself and get on the rotation to get the chance to kill them.  <br>

<br>
Rotations are for sharing mobs you could otherwise kill at your whim.<br>
<br>
Rotations 'tell' my guild what we can or cant kill, and when.<br>
<br>
Rotations are a player-made agreement, they are not verant enforced (except when foul play is introduced, like ks/train).<br>
<br>
So:  I (and my guild) *A G R E E* to hold back and *N O T* kill mobs that we otherwise could, within specefic agreements *to those involved*.  When a new party comes in and *Disrupts* this agreement for us (or other parties involved in this agreement), we are not inclined to *respect* the protection you enjoy on other artificially *protected mobs*.<br>
<br>
It's not a case of saying 'you cant kill this mob', its a case of 'if you cannot use judgement, discipline and respect to try to follow preset rules of preset agreements that have been hashed out to ensure fairness for all involved, then what drives those affected by your selfish actions to respect the protection of mobs you enjoy by our agreement to not kill them?'<br>
<br>
translated to principally:<br>
<br>
rotations are established to be fair.  if you break a part of a rotation, you are basically claiming you have no regard for them, and such invalidate your other rotations.<br>
<br>
remember: &quot;Rotations are a player-made agreement, they are not verant enforced (except when foul play is introduced, like ks/train).&quot;<br>
<br>
which means there is no guarantee to be admited to these rotations, admittance is given through set criteria, and the 'membership' is extended in good faith that you will try to maintain integrity throughout all the aspects of all the rotations. <p><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Emil">Emil Sinclair</a><br>

My guild was the first to benefit from rotations, i never spitted on them. i was kinda surprised at first, that is why i asked.<br>
<br>
And after rethinking of all, i finally came to the conclusion that if we can kill iki and eashen, after all, we arent too far from killing roy. (not saying that it is the case atm, dont misquote me)<br>
<br>
I apologize if anyone thought i was against rotations, that never was the case. And i never spoke for VoF neither. <p><center><b><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=156296">Malaka's Profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucappan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cappan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/02 2:32:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=81>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ntov</span><hr size=1> Just imagine your chances at even seeing Ikk or Eashan if the &quot;big 3&quot; all merged and declaired FFA on everything. <p><CENTER>
