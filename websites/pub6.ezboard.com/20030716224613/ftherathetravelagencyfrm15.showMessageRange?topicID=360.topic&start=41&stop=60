I have some friends on other servers, and from stories I hear, we're almost like friggin socialists in regards to sharing the mobs we want.<br>
<br>
We let you try Dain, Tormax, ToVN, etc. for months without interfering. We could've easily went in and killed any mob you attempted after you failed on it, and it would've been 100% legal. And that precisely is what most uber guilds do on other servers. I pray you guys would live on Mith Marr for just a week; you'ld be BEGGING to come back to the Rathe after killing only kunark dragons, cause Afterlife would kill every single mob you'ld set your sights on. We're so civil to our &quot;competition&quot; that it's sickening to these guilds. What's even more sickening is that all we get in return is insults and greed. Again, go play on any other server with a guild of our caliber, and you will be crying to be back on the server with BotS, where we let you try and learn mobs, instead of swooping in and killing them right after your first wipeout.<br>
<br>
Oh, and if the roles were reversed, and we were given 24 hours free in ToVN without interference, it probably would've taken us few extra weeks, but Vulak would be dead long ago. You, on the other hand, only manage to kill 7-8 dragons on your BEST days, and it stays the same week after week. Don't bitch to us cause you lack the brains, skills and perseverence to learn and advance.<br>

Let me address this one in several parts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
The issue that you are having has nothing to do with Vulak or Vyemm at all.  Your problem is that you aren't clearing the first 11 dragons and all the other spawns as fast as you need to get to these mobs.  Since you seem to have a clear grasp of how long it took us to clear ToV-N our first time, go back and count how many times we cleared everything up to Vyemm/Vulak before we took them out as well.  If I remember correctly, that was twice (we killed Vyemm/Vulak on our third try, I think one of the previous was lost to a patch as well).  Go count how many times we went into ToV-N and count how many times after clearing did it take us to clear it in one night.  If I remember correctly (and this one is easy because we have the DKP records) we did our first one day clearing on our third clearing.  So...  in less than seven trips to ToV-N we were clearing it in one night.  Now, let's count how many times that SoT has been into ToV-N.  Let's also count how many times that SoT has killed each dragon other than Vyemm/Vulak.  I would submit at this point that you have far exceeded our count of trips into ToV-N when we first cleared ToV-N in one night.<br>
<br>

Seems to me that you have met and/or exceeded the times that you harp on us about.  Why aren't you getting faster as you claim you will?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

We are willing to share.  In our current agreement, we each have 24 hours in which to clear (or not clear) ToV-N.  We currently clear ToV-N in 7 hours on average.  You have 3X that amount of time but do not use it.  I would also resubmit that today is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> far</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> from SoT's first time in ToV-N.<br>
<br>
Here are some issues:<br>
- SoT has equivalent numbers and class makeup as we do.  Before you start arguing about this, we have killed every dragon in ToV-N with 38 people and this was a long time back (in our teens of clearings) so equipment arguments hold little weight here.  SoT clearly has more than this number.<br>
- SoT currently has far better equipment than we had when we first cleared ToV-N.<br>
- SoT raids for at least 9 hours a day (just use /who all spirit &lt;class&gt; to check class numbers) which is sufficient time to clear.  Even given that this would be their &quot;first time&quot; they could stay up late maybe (like we did)?<br>
- When we broke into ToV-N, there were no other guilds in competition with the resources.  That affords the &quot;first timers&quot; a little slack in the amount of time used.  Now there is competition over it so it has to be handled in a more timely fashion.<br>
- There is equal access to ToV-N.  You have 24-hours, we have 24-hours.  It is not our fault (or anyone else's but your own) if you do not all of yours or use the hours that you do use effectively.  We have and will continue to stay completely out of ToV-N so there can be no confussion during your rotations there.<br>
- SoT has encountered every dragon and mob in ToV-N except Vyemm/Vulak so the strategies/pulls/tactics should be understood by now, including much more information posted on spoiler sites than existed when we cleared.<br>
<br>
We had offered SoT that the first time they cleared everything up to Vyemm/Vulak in 24 hours but couldn't get those two we would be ok with sliding the rotation to allow them to try those two on the next day.<br>
<br>
In the end, I think it is clear that SoT has spent more time in ToV-N that BotS did before our one-day clearings.  They have cleared all the dragons except Vyemm/Vulak more times than we had when we had our first one-day clearing.  To claim that SoT is still &quot;learning the zone and haven't had the experience BotS has in the zone when we cleared in one-day&quot; is a false statement.  The facts are that SoT has the force and the time to do this and yet they simply haven't.  In the time that it takes for us to clear ToV-N, SoT clears the first five dragons (which is faster than before at three dragons) and this doesn't take into account the &quot;back five&quot; which are killable in two hours time max.  In fact, SoT's last ToV-N trip lasted about 7 hours and with two more hours effort they would have been able to attempt Vyemm and then Vulak but they chose to terminate their rotation and left the zone.  It is not an issue of 24-hours vs 48-hours.  It is an issue of 7 hours vs 9 hours.  The problem is not in the 24-hour rotation schedule. <p><P>

<br>
You /moveserver here and get to hang out with the cool kids at school and you think that makes you cool?  Think again.  BotS is a damn good guild and I think everyone here can respect their accomplishments even if they don't like some BotS.  Don't expect me *to treat you with respect like some old friends in and out of BotS when you just came here and really haven't even built a rep for yourself in either positive or negative fashion.  Don't get me wrong, I don't know you and never had anything against you.  However, I now realize you can't take a joke.  To add to that, your pompous comment makes me think I should hold some value in your words which I don't.  Go eat some of those carrots you carry around.<br>

Dearest Haisama,<br>
It is amazing how hard you try to defend yourself, with adding some dumb comments and sh!t. I know that you tried to joke with me (yes, i was aware of that) and i didn't even take the things you've said personally. If you prefer this perverted and sick sexual acitivity, have fun, but don't expect that i will laugh about it. I could have flamed you down, like others do when they get those comments. I could have told you what a brainless moron you are, bla bla bla..But i didn't, and why? Because it doesn't make sense. I just say &quot;Leave me alone with those comments, i can't laugh about it (long version) you dork&quot; and you jump on it like a monkey on acid. It's amazing...Yes i know that i am hell direct (thats how my parents grew me up), but that's how i am and i don't need to flame someone down to make me feel the Master.. Do you?<br>

BotS is a damn good guild and I think everyone here can respect their accomplishments even if they don't like some BotS. Don't expect me *to treat you with respect like some old friends in and out of BotS when you just came here and really haven't even built a rep for yourself in either positive or negative fashion. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I love that Quoting. It's endless cool. No @#%$. Ok, lemme answer on it. I really didn't need to servermove here to become &quot;cool&quot; (what a dumb word again), i was already &quot;cool&quot;. Don't get me wrong, but i gave a @#%$ what BotS accomplished or not. i didn't need another Uberguild that did NTov etc etc. i had all this. And it was far from being the reason i moved to The Rathe. BotS is doing big Targets and farming ubergear and all, but even if they wouldn't do this @#%$, they would be still the most amazing guild i have ever be in - because of the People. Finding a Family, where mates care about each other, help and back up someone owns everything else. <br>
<br>
And about the Reputation-thingi: I am not one of those mice that always sit in dark corner. No, i am going around, talking to people, help where i can and make friends. And when i count all the people that i talk to every day or that greet me when i zone into new area, then i think you are wrong about the bad/good reputation-thing. And its not because of my tag, i doubt that i would have so many &quot;new friends&quot; in Spirit of Tunare and other Guilds then. <br>

There is hope for you yet Mephana.  As soon as you can let go of the bias you come of defending your guild and come to the dark side and join the dark side of Ameriscum.<br>

In your shallow mind, logical conversation is a game and I lose.  I live in the same state as Felenia (him/her).  I am a professional and would be more than welcome to discussing any differences we have face to face.  I know some of you may see that as some sort of threat but it truly is not.  I doubt a lot of this @#%$ would be said if we saw each other face to face.  I saw people face to face at Orlando Fan Fair and I was myself as were others (I think).<br>
<br>
Fact is you insulted me as an Air Force member by calling me Americscum.  No I do not blame you for any of the events of 9/11 but I will say WE Ameriscum are more on our toes than before (at least I hope we are).<br>

i am not lesbian..sorry...<br>
<br>
<br>
and about 9/11...A friend of mine died at this @#%$ and every countrey showed what they think about it. So don't give me this please, because thats insulting to me as well then. Calling someone Ameriscums, who calls us Eurotrashs has nothing to do with the horrible things that happend. So don't even bring it up. Its really sad that you try to use something like the 9/11 for finding an excuse to flame. You should feel ashamed :/<br>
<br>
about all the &quot;cool&quot;-comments:<br>
----------------------------------<br>
My Dear, you added it, it was your word, i just used them and put them into those little cute things &quot;&quot;. Don't you feel like snugglin them as well, when you see it?<br>
<br>
Back to the beginning: Joke or not a Joke, that is here the Question. <br>
----------------------------------------------<br>
Dude, you still don't get it. And it makes no sense to discuss with you anymore, i am afraid. I tried to explain everything in my posting and those words weren't mean or rude or whatever. It was a strict and direct explanaition and you still feel insulted. I dunno for whom i feel more sorry atm. For me that i have to deal with such a brainless moron or for you, that you will never reach the point, where you understand things that seems kinda too high for your horizont yet <br>

Oh and since you toss me some nice slang words..Lemme toss you some as well:<br>

If it is true your friends died on the attacks on 9/11 I give my condolescences.  I lost many colleagues I knew personally and professionally.  I never called you Eurotrash you ignorant b!tch(slam as a comment not the percieced).  You said calling someone [bold] Ameriscums [/bold] has nothing to do with what happened on 9/11 then I can say anyone that agrees with you is not a Patriot.  <br>
<br>
Last thing, I guarantee you if you show up in front of my squadron and say I am ,  &quot;trying to use something like the 9/11 for finding an excuse to flame. You should feel ashamed :/&quot;, you will get your ass whipped by any WOMEN but the men will sit back and cheer (quite different scene).<br>

<br>
First off, if Felenia called me Ameriscum which I didn't see posted besides the words by you stuffed in Felenia's mouth, he/she can join the protesters in Orlando.  DON'T F'UCK WITH AMERICA AND PATRIOTS LIKE ME.  WE MAKE AL QUAEDA LOOK LIKE BABY SITTERS. <br>
<br>
Tell you what when you can speak for Felenia (who lives in Florida and near my base if h/she is near a base) and he/she can meet and discuss with me me face to face at any Air Force Base in Florida then talk Sh!t.  Otherwise suck on my weinerschnitsul (spelling: no disrespect intended to Germans) Meph Lustbunny.<br>

Let me say I don't understand this &quot;sinep&quot;, online talk for the most part, BotS talk and frankly this is one of the area of studies I don't care about.  Mephana, I don't care what size your &quot;sinep&quot; is, just keep it away from me or I will cut it off.<br>
<br>
I had nothing against you but after all this chitter chatter, I can see BotS doesn't give a sh!t about the quality of the people BotS has (at least as far as clerics go).  It's kind of like hunting in Sebelis: any level cleric will do as long as they won't aggro the whole damn zone.<br>

I am not going to get into a pissing contest with you, as you are the retard who has to have the last word in. <br>
<br>
But I would love to get ahold of you as one as my subordinates.  And if you act like you do on your job, then either you never have been promoted, are disliked by the people you work with, or got booted a long time ago, and still claim to hold your position, like a low-life, like you would do just to add flavor to his/hers post.<br>
<br>
You are currently stationed in Florida? Where about's?  Cause I am currently station at Patrick, AFB there and yes you are right, I am living it up on welware there as a commissioned officer.  Serving in the the Space Program, but hey your the grunt who serves my french fries in the chow hall?  Oh no?... But you have to be with the low IQ you have.  All you do is post your @#%$ ass remarks and threaten to cut peoples tounge off.  <br>
<br>
If you ever threaten that to Mephana or anyone I know I will personally take a drive to come see you or invite you over for a cup of tea, either is fine, so you can talk this @#%$ to my face.<br>

Yes that was fine and I explained to him/her, it was a joke.  He/her posted later in another thread that Galudina something to the exten that she should not be personally offended my jokes Sam made yet chooses to be offended to be offended in this thread at my joke.<br>

There are very few things that upset me in a virtual enviroment but when a slur that is used against my country is used, I apologize I get upset.<br>
