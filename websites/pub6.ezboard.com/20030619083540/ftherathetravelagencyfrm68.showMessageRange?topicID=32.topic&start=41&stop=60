I like it, but what happens when someone breaks an international law? O yeah, nothing. Because nobody has the stones to enforce them. If they aren't being enforced then are they valid? No. Like here in Texas we had no open container law for years then they made one, but didn't assign a punishment for breaking it therefor rendering it useless. The UN that you love so dearly does shit. It knowingly lets more atrocities go on every day without lifting a finger than you can count, and you defend them? Out of sight out of mind I guess.<br>

Are you in the CIA? Do you work at the NSA? Are you a top official anywhere, for any government? No? Then what the flying fuck do you need with any of that information? They have a right to withhold any evidence they want. Do you think that if they reveal the information and how they got it that the people who gave them that information will just be forgiven in Iraq? Let go to freely come to the USA? No they would be beaten, electrocuted, stabbed, then shot in the head and then buried upside down in a shallow unmarked grave. It is people like you who get people killed, in the police and in the intelligence agencies. Before you go talking about how unjustified it is to spy on people even if they are doing evil evil things. Imagine your wife, and how pretty she is, how much you love her. Now imagine her dead because of a bombing by terrorist financed by Saddam or anyone else for that matter, or raped and murdered by some freaked out Meth freak all because your privacy might or might not have been infringed on by the government you seem to hate so much and the laws where changed. I bet in all your delusional paranoia that you would blame the US government and say they caused it on purpose because you don't recycle. There are evil people in the world, there always have been and always will be, and no amount of diplomacy is going to change or fix that. If he was so innocent, why didn't he say &quot;come in, we can show you what ever you want&quot;?

So... you are saying that you read and *understand* the UN Security Council resolutions that said that Saddam had to *comply* with several resolutions and that these resolutions were to be enforced by &quot;any means necessary&quot;.  You also read and *understand* all the UN Security Council resolutions that state definitively and unambiguously that Saddam Hussain and Iraq were not complying throughout 12 years.<br>
<br>
You are also saying that you understand the many, many instances where Saddam Hussain violated human rights.<br>
<br>
You understand that the UN Security Council resolution stated that Saddam Hussain had to comply or they would be enforced by &quot;any means necessary&quot;.<br>
<br>
Either you and I have a different view of what &quot;any means necessary&quot; means and of what &quot;human rights&quot; are, or there is something else fundimentally different about our interpretation of the UN Security Council resolutions.<br>

It does not matter how many facts you put in front of him, or how many smoking guns you show him. He is one of the sad few out there that hangs on to blind pride in his ideas, and cannot fathom that he might be wrong. So give up on it, he is locked in a box and cant think outside of it.<br>
<br>
Now, as for the UN and its &quot;laws&quot;. The UN ran into a major problem recently. 3 major powers of the UN saw that one of its laws were going to cost their countries Billions of dollars. Therefore they rallied under a flag of peace in order to save themselves from losing that money. <br>
<br>
The U.S. may or may not have had a valid reason in screaming about the WMD's, but either way, Iraq was making the UN look like the biggest chumps in the world. He constantly laughed in the UN's face. He disobeyed the UN's &quot;laws&quot; daily, and flaunted it. <br>
<br>
Abaz asks why China and others would follow the UN laws now that America attacked. <br>
I ask why would China follow the laws of a UN that is afraid to enforce its laws? Why? Because there are some members of the UN that WILL take extra steps to enforce them. The U.S, Britain, Italy, Austrailia, Bulgaria, Spain, and many many more countries stood up and said &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; I dont understand how people think that the U.S. and Britain are acting like lone warriors. Over half the world's nations are supporting this action by either words, money, food, medical supplies, or troops!!! And I dare ya to take a look at many of the nations that are not in support. Like France, Germany, and Russia....all of who are losing billions of dollars due to the fall of Saddam. Greed, that is what the problem has been all along......pure greed.<br>
<br>
So let the Abaz's around the world scream injustice with their limited concepts of world affairs, they are the minority in this situation. They are the same people you see at all the demonstrations. The same people that roam around talking the same talk, no matter what. (Hell, all Abaz can talk about is that ONE tank that helped pull down the ONE statue, at request of the civilians mind you. Yet you would think we have our tanks roaming Iraq, ignoring the enemy, looking for statues to pull down.) LOL Limited vision in its prime! <br>
<br>
Some people are like that, but that is what is great about free nations, they can be that way, and they can make it public. And those of us in uniform will wake up tomorrow, put on that uniform, and go and protect all the Abaz's of the free world so that they can continue to think &quot;In the box&quot;. (Keep in mind I am referring to more than just U.S. military there. I am also referring to our friends of many free nations that stand for a moral belief and stand strong in it)<br>

I forgot it already.  I really enjoyed your post on page one.   I agree with alot of what you said and the information provided really does debunk alot of our reasons for the war.   After page one alot of your posts went down hill, but so does everyones as you watch rebuttals filll with opinion and less fact and take on new angles when intial logic fails.   Anyway, at this time the only thing that is going to validate this war for me is in finding out if the UN Resolution sh!t holds any weight in it's arguement.   What I mean by this is that I would have to look into past Resolutions in the UN and how strongly they were upheld.   Does the US/UN show continuity in upholding Resolutions or is it just convenient for it to do so now??<br>
mm.. and not just UN Resolutions but how well were Treaties/ Peace agreements and the like adhered to in the past and what was the US's reaction to any deviations?    The show of continuity is very important to me and I'd be interested to see if it's there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xarien>Xarien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/14/03 8:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: (insert topic here)</span><hr size=1> Gromm, I was merely apply to this quote:<br>
