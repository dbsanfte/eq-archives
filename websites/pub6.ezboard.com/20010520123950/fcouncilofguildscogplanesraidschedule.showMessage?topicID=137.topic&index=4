But past is past granted.<br>
Right now all of FoF is going over the rules set out by SB for the raids they held and are making minimal course corrections here and there. One we are all strong on is that the BP, legs and God loot be all 1 roll. No one should be able to walk away with possibly all 3 in 1 night we feel so thats a probability for ammendment. We'll post a list of the original rules and our revised ones when we're ready.<br>
<br>
PS. we would start running raids right away but our guild leader lost his isp (they went bankrupt) and he asked us to wait for him.<br>

The cleric in question HAD attempted to cede her drop to another cleric in /ooc.  Now whether or not something /ooc'd is considered to be binding is something for the loot coordinator to decide.  But she did declare in a public channel she didnt want them and wanted them to go to another cleric.  Now they were ultimately looted by the next highest rolling cleric which I think was the right thing.  After all, the concensus does seem to be that if you win the roll on an item you dont want, then you dont get to choose who it goes to, it goes to the next highest roller.  Which is the whole point of lottoing the loot anyway.  And I can honestly say that having ceded her right to the armor drop she should not have been awarded straight out any other loot automatically.  And she definetly should not have been allowed to choose to loot the hammer.  God loot is god loot.  That being said, as Lag said the past is the past, we just need to move forward.  I do just want to say that this is not meant as a criticism of Dogedme or the management team.  At that point in the raid things were very hectic and mistakes happen.  They did the best they could and for me at least, thats more than good enough.  Mistakes happen (never in my favor of course, but I keep hoping...IRS hear my plea...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Just something to keep in mind for the future however.<br>
<br>
Now all that having been said let me say the raid in general was a lot of fun and quite successful (especially for you clerics out there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  We took about 60 people on in and I believe we only had 3 deaths.  A 5% death rate on break in is quite remarkable.  Even for an uber guild and its something we shoudl be proud of.  Even if we &quot;cheated&quot; a bit with CotH.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now I know that many people see this as an acceptable use to available resources, much like using succor to get across SG to WW, I do sort of miss the adrenaline rush of running through Hate wondering if I'm going to die this time and how long it'll take to do so.  One concern I do have about this method, however, is that Plane raiding is not the goal in and of itself.  I see it not just as a Plane raid but also training for other harder raids in the future.  Raids on the Grotto or the Necropolis or Velks and Kael and the like.  To do these raids we need everyone to know how to get to camps without training.  We need them to have experience in long dangerous runs and how to deal with them.  Now I agree the CotH method is great if the people already have this experiece and it really cuts down on the break in.  I believe we were raiding in abot an hour and a half which is really good.  But my experiece is that it would be better for CoG in the long run to do it the hard way and call the raid a bit early than to take an easier way and pay for it later.  But thats just my 2cents.  I personally did like the almost no deaths on breakin myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Congrats.<br>
<br>
My major concern on the raid, however, is pretty much the same one I've always had.  People need to pay attention to what the Raid Commander says.  And I dont mean saying , &quot;yeah we heard you, now go pull us the phat lewt.&quot;  I mean actually following directions.  Like getting off the wall.  I dont know how many times this was said, but even at the end of the raid, there were still people on the wall!  I dont care if he did or did not give a reason for getting off the wall.  I dont care if you had a reason for being up there.  I dont even care if the Raid Commander was on drugs and was giving suicidal orders.  If the Raid Commander says something you do it.  Period.  You dont question it, you dont ignore it, you dont go back to doing whatever it was 5 minutes later.  If you dont agree with their orders you can always leave the raid, but if you stay you follow them unhesitatingly and without question.  If you disagree /talk to your group leader but in the meantime do what you're told.  Its for the raids best intrest even if it might not be in your particular best intrests.  The raid comes first before anyone.  This also applies to fighting mobs.  I know the tendency is to pull the mob as far back to the wall as possible.  This is a good thing generally.  But when the mob gets ON the wall, you need to pull him back.  Everyone needs to pull him back.  Dont wait for the main assist to move back, dont wait for the raid commander to yell at you to do so.  When you see the mob on the wall, pull back.  It seems pretty simple to me.  I understand issues about lag and all that.  But also remember when fighting these mobs if you're in the back the people in the front might not be able to move back and thus pull the mob back till you do.  So especially if you're towards the back disengage and pull back.  If mob corpses are lost in the wall there will be some very unhappy people out there, and you dont want them yelling at you.  Its annoying and very unproductive.  So listen up and follow directions and even more importantly keep an eye out FOR those directions.  On a raid saying &quot;I didnt see that&quot; really isnt an excuse.  Even if true it can still get everyone killed.  Experience means to anticipate orders before they are given so that you are already leaning in the right direction when they're finally issued.<br>
<br>
Now dont get me wrong on any of this please, the raid was wonderful.  It was a heads and shoulder's improvement over our last one.  People for the most part did follow orders and we really kicked ass.  IT was for the most part very enjoyable for all and I heard few if any complaints.  That is a Good Thing.   Really.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I know I was certainly proud of my group and how they functioned.  Granted they were almost all experienced Planes raiders, but from what I saw pretty much everyone else did well too.  The problems I described above were by no means the norm and were really only isolated incidents.  I just wanted to get people aware to them before they became major incidents <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
To all of you who went on the raid, congratulations.  For those of you who never lost your sense of humor and who were willing to take the good with the bad I congratulate you.  For those of you who didnt win anything, I say stop using my dice they're weighted to roll 1's.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   For the last SB run raid I can only call this a major success and a great way to cap off a successful series of Planes raids.  I for one will miss raiding the Planes with you.  To the Group Sex pullers, I appreciate the pulls you did (epecially those 2 sprite golems <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and I thank you for a wonderful job and all the deaths you took on our behalf.  You did so with humor and with good spirits and were always ready for the next pull.  This to me was an example that all the other groups should be aspiring to.  Congratulations on a raid well done, and here's to many more in the future.<br>
