After watching that, I laughed, I cried, and I snickered. This is by far, without a doubt, the most creative anti war argument I've ever seen. By trying to pass off children that are CLEARLY the victims of chemical and biological attacks (more likely than not on their parents) as being the result of the first Gulf War, Eric Bumsripped has completely discredited himself. <br>
<br>
I am appalled, that you would even dare to say most of it is true Jurrasic. That was essentially the only point the presentation tried to make, so as we all know, or should know if we are no COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS those victims were hurt at the hands Saddam, so which part is &quot;mostly true&quot;? <br>
<br>
I am actually, disgusted, probably for only the second time in my entire online boards career by this post. I am disgusted that I live in the same country, nay on the same planet, as someone who could try and pass off crap like that as truth. The people who create, and distribute this bullshit, are outdone by those who try and legitimize it. It is those vile, low, I can't even find a  proper word at this moment, people that claim the holocaust never happened, or say that Sept. 11th was done by remote control by the U.S. government. It is these villains, these cretins, these satinists that keep this world from ever reaching a point where we can be free of biggotry, and the hatred that plagues us as a race. <br>
<br>
Using pictures of president bush with his finger in his mouth, and another with his hair flying all over the place.. clever, funny? HARDLY. Disgraceful is what I say. This presentation is a mockery of the truth, not even worth watching. In fact, I would venture that one is actually worse off for watching it. All pro or contra arguments for the war aside, this is sickening, filthy, wretchid, sorid, nauseating garbage, that irks me to the core. Kurdish victims of Saddam's brutality would roll in their graves, and spew the fires of hell if they ever saw this. <br>
<br>
I think anyone, who believes, and even worse, who spreads this perjury is... a hatemonger of the worst kind.<br>

If you really believe anything that website is boasting, and posting the link in the first place denotes you do [believe] to a certain extent, then you are only criticizing for the sake of doing so.  You imply we (defenders of the US in spirit and support) or our beliefs are bad or evil or whatever other wordy statements you want.  I say yours are.<br>

'clearly' everyone thinks that our bombs have brains and can tell the difference between civilians, children, and iraqi soldiers.<br>
<br>
'clearly' YOU are NAIVE in your assumptions.<br>
<br>
War is never pretty and whether you think that flash file was just bullshit propaganda or the truth, none of us will ever know. What is the truth though, is that our government will never show us pictures of what the bombs that went astray did to civilians.  On top of this, they would never tell us if we used any weapons that had depleted uranium in them.  Realize, what we see of the war is never the full picture.  It might not be as one-sided as the Iraqi govt's picture, but WE will never see unglorious parts of war.  What we will see is:  Iraqi's celebrating as we drive through their town, our bombs blowing things up(As if we were celebrating the 4th of july) and any portraits to inflict pride within American people.  <br>
<br>
There is a reason why our TV does not show the corpses of brave Americans who lost their lives.  There is a reason why we don't get to see the mangled bodies of Civilians and children who lost limbs directly from our ordinance.  <br>
<br>
In summation..It may be unclear where those pictures came from, but it is quite 'clear' that the causation of some of them may very well be from a bomb from our great nation.  <br>
<br>
Think this one through too...<br>

I really wanted to respond to your whole thread and dissect the shit out of it (like I always do), but this one line is enough to rip the rest of it to shreds.<br>
<br>
All of us that support this war just know how friggin hard it is to be so precise in targetting, but considering the fact that they hide behind civilians and children, it's amazing we haven't slaughtered them all.<br>

I love this one.  Need to add it to my list.  What to call it?  Hmmm.<br>

It's like a backpeddle but it looks like a redirect.  Problem is that it's pure conjecture except you did emphasis 'clear' to smokescreen &quot;may very well be&quot;.<br>

Definitely one of the best spin statements I've ever seen.  Grats.<br>

<br>
While nothing is perfect, I am willing to say , that the Technology that we have available to us , is allowing us to do what is needed to be done, while at the same time Minimizing Casualties against those that we are not specifically targetting ... <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>'clearly' everyone thinks that our bombs have brains and can tell the difference between civilians, children, and iraqi soldiers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again I refer to the technology that we have, which is allowing us to minimize this... Again note that I'm saying minimize ... Technology isn't perfect , and mistakes as well as system errors are possible ... Discouting the fact that we are doing what we can to make sure that innocents are not injured , is absurd. <br>
<br>
As for telling the &quot;difference&quot; between Iraqi soldiers , and Civilians and Children ... Well if the Iraqi soldiers would stop hiding in Hospitals , Neighborhoods , schools , and other Civilian Areas , this wouldn't be a problem ... If the Iraqi soldiers would stop dressing up as civilians themseleves and using that to get in close and/or behind our troops, then again this wouldn't be a problem ... Anyone remember the North Korea / South Korea war ... While I  only know what was taught to me in History class, I have a definate recolection of being taught, how these types of tactics (that are starting to be seen in Iraq)were used on our troops once .... So unfortunately when Armies resort to using Innocents as part of their active war tactics ... You will have casualties ... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>'clearly' YOU are NAIVE in your assumptions.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And it would appear that alot of people are Ignorant of the facts that we ARE doing what we can to minimize Civilian Casualties ... and That it is the IRAQI Army , that is INTENTIONALLY  putting their own civilians in harms way ... NOT us... <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>War is never pretty <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No one here is saying that it is .... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What is the truth though, is that our government will never show us pictures of what the bombs that went astray did to civilians.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Of course not, However , this does not negate the fact that we are doing everything we possibly can to prevent this in the first place, and does not give right, to completely disprove the government and say that what we are doing isn't right.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>On top of this, they would never tell us if we used any weapons that had depleted uranium in them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Depleted Uranium means what in this ? That some weapons are stronger than others ? <br>
Failing to see how this is coming into play here , other than as an example...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Realize, what we see of the war is never the full picture. It might not be as one-sided as the Iraqi govt's picture, but WE will never see unglorious parts of war.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again see my point above , that no government would do this ... <br>
Now Other Governments that aren't directly involved might do this ... Just like they are now ... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What we will see is: Iraqi's celebrating as we drive through their town,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This also goes back to the point about what governments won't do ... although in this case of what they will do ... Paragraph of repetition ?   <br>
<br>
What government wouldn't do this ? Any government that openly broadcast every single solitary little thing that goes on , or was done , would never last ... I'm not talking Government administrations here ... I'm talking the Government itself ... If a government operated in this manner , there would constantly be open revolt all over the place ... More so than those that protesting etc... AND no Government EVER would do the &quot;Dirty&quot; work ... Because every single solitary one of them would be petrified of their own citizens... <br>
<br>
One of the reasons that Governments succeed , is because they don't tell their citizens everything ... <br>
<br>
The movie Men in Black, had a good line in it ... It was stated that if Everyone knew everything that was going on ... there would be mass pandamonium ... <br>
<br>
And yet the masses don't see this ... they are the masses ... they are the people that would be causing the pandamonium if they knew everything ... and so they are pissed cause they don't know everything .... Hmm sounds like a round robin to me ... <br>
<br>

<br>
Inflict ... You say that as if you're ashamed of being an American ... And you have used the term OUR several times in your post ... So I would be willing to say that you are an American ... <br>
<br>
So long as we are not committing mass atroscities (sp?) , and I firmly believe that we are not doing so with what we are trying to do in Iraq ... then regardless of what our Government does, I'm proud to be an American ... If they want to try to &quot;inflict&quot; pride upon me ... they won't have to try very hard ... <br>
<br>
If you don't have pride in the country that you live in , then there is a problem... <br>

Can't deny the possibilities of that note this is possibilities ... NOT FACT ... and to base your entire anti status , off a very HUGE IF, when it has been stated repeatedly , that we are doing what we can to minimize those types of casualties is ludicrous...and using it as proof that your view point is correct is even more ludicrous , especialy when the source of those images is unknown , and quite possibly manufactured and even manipulated...<br>

You honestly think that Iraq doesn't have WMD's ?  Iraqi troops have been Captured with Chemical Suites etc. In case of Chemical Attacks ... ?? Why ? <br>
<br>
Not cause we are going to use them ... But because they know they have them , and don't want to get a taste of their own medicine if they do get used. <br>
<br>
And if you honestly think that we use Chemical warfare , then there are more issues than that of logic that need to be addressed. <br>

Quoting some of the most socially inept people on the planet is just retarded. 90% of Hollywood is only high school educated (there are exceptions but it is not the norm so don't start talking about the isolated cases), they only hang out with each other and wouldn't know real life it hit them in the face (in which case they would hire Johnny Cochran and sue life 5 million dollars). If you are a slave to what Hollywood has to say, I pity you more than I pity the people who are a slave to what CNN has to say.<br>
<br>
Before you start talking about Dubbyas education via SAT scores and grades at Yale let me say this. The SAT was VERY different back when he took the thing and even though it is a low score was still better than the national average at the time. Yale is not your run of the mill school (I'm not sure if anyone on these boards can attest to that fact but if you can chime in) it is a very difficult school and he passed and most everyone who wants to talk shit about it couldn't even get in (via nepotism or grades), much less pass. Again I'm not his biggest fan by any means, I'm an Astros fan and we hate the Rangers. I just wanted to head off any shit talking in defense of my Hollywood education statement.<br>

Unlike congress, a bunch of us here have relatives in the Armed forces or have served ourselves. So don't start throwing that shit in our faces.<br>
