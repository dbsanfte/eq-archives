last time i checked this was still a GAME (anyone else remember that word?) regardless of what happens here or in GAME the sun will still shine birds will sing and the moon will pass through its phases (all those things happen in RL for those of you who may have forgotten) so break out the pins deflate the egos and go back to playing<br>
well you can leave the egos intact (monkeys with a sense of importance no matter how trivial it may truly be are highly entertaining to the more evolved) <br>
so in conclusion swing from your trees throw shit at each other or whatever it is you do just remember that a GAME is for enjoyment <br>
i for one am off to play the GAME (theres that word again if any of you own a dictionary that hasnt been chewed on or turned into nesting material look it up its a good word) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

We had our raid removed from the calendar 4 days before it was supposed to go. People have taken time off from work and so forth to be there and now this has been cancelled as a form of punishment for a rule that we broke that doesnt even exist. If you want to ban our calendar posting rights for 30 days AFTER unday fine so be it. But to cancel a large scale raid 4 days before with no reason is total BS.  As for the BB we did call them in . Realize we were ahead of schedule and had every intent on clearing the zone. Plans changed and as soon as we decided so we called BB. Again maybe an hour and a 1/2 was to short but as Ive stated a 100 times it wasnt a full zone clear it was 15 amy knights and cazic. If a guild like BoTS cant do it in an hour and a 1/2 id be seriously amazed, for a guild of there numbers once there in zone its a 15 minute project. Hell we even had the wanderers around cazic dead. To ban someone on rules that dont exist alone is BS but hey as we said fine whatever, but to cancel a raid 4 days away for no obvious reason just doesnt fly.  <br>
<br>
Heres in fact what we are gettin in trouble for. We left with cazic up. Now this is what I find funny, we are taking the heat for Bots. We called them in to kill cazic and after debating it for 45 min decided they didnt have enough people interested to come and help us. So what were we supposed to do we called in BoTs cause we werent going to kill cazic due to many ppl loggin and then the BB guild decided not to show. What becomes of this.....well is OUR fault BB didnt want to help us so we take the blame. Again fine whatever but banning a raid so close isnt acceptable for things out of our control.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uevilrulz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evilrulz</A> at: 3/7/01 4:24:33 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubiasschmias.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bias Schmias</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Glossolalia/CTA</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>205</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/7/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>5:25:27 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: What kind of power trip...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Not to come off as a terminal hardass, but if you want the priviledges of a reserved date, be ready to take a god down at a moment's notice.<br>
<br>
if the servers had gone down at 8pm PST and not come up until 9pm, and the plane didn't get repopped until 9:45, and you immediately called in BotS and they couldn't/wouldn't do it, that's one thing.  I'm sure everyone would be understanding if that were the case.<br>
<br>
Right or wrong, it is ultimately the job of the raiding guild to ensure the god goes down.  The epic rotation is in place to facilitate that.  The moment you knew BotS wasn't coming, other arrangements should have been made.  You're not taking the heat for BotS or anyone else.  You're taking the heat for being the raiding guild and failing to take down Cazic.  It really truly is that simple.  <br>
<br>
Or, in other words:<br>
<br>
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.<br>

PS - is anyone else as amused as I am that i'm defending BotS, in even an oblique way?

&quot;When I posted earlier I thought they they did kill CT, just 30 minutes late after the BB guild didn't come because of the late call in. They left a god up - thats deserves the suspension, and BoTS cannot be held acountable when it is that late with no prior communication.&quot;<br>

<br>
Secondly I find it hard to believe that because the zone was poped at 10pm we have to call in BB instantly before even doing anything. Hell at 12:15 Draco was already dead. The calendar states as soon as you know you cant kill the god call BB. We were well within our time to clear the zone, but near the end things fell through.  <br>
<br>
As for Bots is not rocket science BoTs was on when the server crashed and knew they were on BB. So it stands to reason they should automatically be ready to help. Everyone is saying since zone was poped at 10pm we should have called in BB insto before even killin a mob, then it also stands to reason should be prepared for a call. <br>
<br>
The tell I gave at 3:30 wasnt the 1st tell to BoTs I talked to them at 10pm (well they gave me the tell) and they asked if we needed BB, I said dont know soon as zone is repoped we are gonna see if we can do it and if we cant well let you know. It was left at that. We had a time schedule to clear fear and as long as we were ahead of it we didnt need BB. Hell we never fell behind the time schedule we just decided we wanted to call it so we notified BB. <br>
<br>
What cracks me up is it seems everyone has 100 different stories about what happend when only me and 1 person from BoTs were involved.  Morty posting we gave them 30 minutes notice and emil posting we gave them an hour and so forth. I have came right out and said exactly what happened I even admitted we had more than 6 VK join us. I said it many times the tell for BB help was made at 3:30am, this gave them 90 minutes. I agree it was a short amount of time but theres a portal in ferott and even if it took them an hour to show up, they could have cleared in 30 min solving both problems of the 2am rule and the god rule. It was at 4:30am when I finally got a striaght answer from someone in BoTS that they had decided not to show. By then this left 30 in our raid. (After BoTs declined I seriously wasnt sure what should happen, if callin another BB infringes or what not to mention since Bots had declined this left no time for another guild to come in and meet the 5am deadline. </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umaxed1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maxed1</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Wog</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>1</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/7/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>6:29:01 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: What kind of power trip...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">What seems to be lost here is the fact that:<br>
- We THOUGHT we could do him , hence the late push. We thought it was a GIVEN.<br>
- When we realized we had lost ppl , we took a STAB at him , and called BB.  You are REALLY &quot;splitting hairs&quot; here, on the call in time on BB.  I HONESTLY believe that this is more to do with your opinion on Shadow Reapers PERSONALLY.<br>
IE: I have a hard time believing you would ever penalize the &quot;UBER&quot; guilds on this point....and beleive me , lots of stuff goes unposted here, violations violations....but since we dont &quot;split hairs&quot; on our &quot;Uber friends&quot; they get away with a lot.  Hence a guild like SR's gets to be the scapegoat and all our peeps who have taken time off to go to HATE are SoL.  ALL OVER THE FUCKING &quot;BB&quot; TIMEFRAME.<br>
It was late, we lost ppl to LD , a couple key members gone, and the situation had changed.  We tried when we thought we'd win, and failed, we CALLED BB...who if they were &quot;ON RED ALERT BB @%#$ STANDBY&quot; , could have easily dispatched the few amy knights left and the GOD.   Who the HELL calls in BB when it looks like its a cakewalk.  It wasnt'...situation changed on us we lost , we called BB  We TRIED to do our best.  So admit it , you just don't like us , and that is the issue....enough that you could split hairs for hours about it.....good enough ....hope you got a power rush from it.  </font><P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=3><B><FONT COLOR=FF0000>Maxed Attackk - Shadow Reapers <br>58'th Master - Rathe</FONT></B></FONT>

If you read the thread that rewena posted it CLARIFIED that while it does not hold the non posting entity libal for not following the rules the POSTING entity is libal for haveing more then 6 invites from ANY organization.<br>
<br>
There have been 4 guilds of late that have gotten &quot;sanctions&quot; against them. THE ONLY reason your ruleing was made publicly is because you decided to make this a public event.<br>
<br>
Your broke the rules and you will not post for 30 days.<br>
You joined you pledged to have the plane cleared or call in the BB, 30 min before 2am PAC is NOT ACCEPTABLE <br>
<br>
8 persons from ANYWHERE is NOT ACCEPTABLE.<br>
<br>
Your accusations against me and my admins are also UNACEPTABLE.<br>
<br>
I nor do they benefit from this job AT ALL. We are placed here because our judgement and manerisms have been deemed level headed and fair. You got the same punishment ANYONE on there first offense would get.<br>

Flat out they had 90 minutes warning, you get that 90 minutes warning, 30 minutes was when they told us they changed there minds and werent coming. While this doesnt seem that long, considering what was left standing in fear this was actually a fair amount of time. <br>
<br>
Secondly your &quot;Non posting entity&quot; isnt held responsible doesnt even make sense, they have no posting rights so the calendar rules dont apply to them, hell read the rules its say that the 6 people applies to posting guilds. <br>
<br>
8 people 100 ppl whatever the number as long as its a non posting entity are allowed to go and loot, read the rules. The whole &quot;spirit&quot; of the calendar as you like to call it embraces this.<br>
<br>
Yes a god was left up so there is something we do not deny, but again the BB sayin well be there and cancelling pretty much left us holding the ball. I did not know what to do after this point nor did I know DBN was the next guild in line. Before you go off on sayin read the board I did and it said BoTS next BB (nt) so I didnt see a point in readin further the topic had all the info I need.<br>
<br>
The problem I have with you and some of the admins is simple, only me and the person In bots I talked to know what really happend, but yet all your info you seem to be gettin from hearsay. Bots gave me a tell at 10pm and asked if we needed BB, we said wed let them know if we did. It wasnt a formal request for help but they knew we would ask them if we needed them.  <br>
<br>
Anyway its a shame, its seems the calendar has turned into greed for some people and those persons/guilds make it very obvious. Even the thought of banning people from the calendar cause the let a non posting guild loot items that would otherwise rot is beyond retarded. </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ublarnistoan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BlarniStoan</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Wog</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>1</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/7/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11:15:22 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: The Ruleing Stands as is</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Ok is this whole calendar thing moving on to the new server ?

And the 8 people there were not part of the calander posting system. <br>
<br>
And BB was informed. The God was left up becasue of our failed attempt and theirs in completing it and or informing the next party/Guild of BB. <br>
<br>
Your arguments show no evidence of forethought. I have read and read and read the rules again and still am miffed how you come off so. <br>
<br>
SHOW US hard FACTS on NOT being able to invite 8 people that are not on the calander system. <br>
<br>
SHOW US hard FACTS that 90 mins or 30 mins is NOT acceptable standard. <br>
<br>
SHOW US hard FACTS that we , oh how you put it .... oh thats right, SR left a god up, when it was very CLEAR that a BB guild was called. <br>
<br>
I am sorry, but the very fact that you fail to recognise your own beliefs/rules/creed has made me lose all respect for this. And yet, you continue that you are correct and stand by your arguments, while it is blatent that no such violations occured.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I read your post several times over and over Vince and I think you and Bias must read one post and respond to another with complete dissregard to the matters at hand.<br>

FACT if a BB declines talk to the next BB<br>
FACT if you have problems contact a admin<br>
FACT I was on till 4am EST time with no info from SR<br>
FACT you leave a god up, and dont give ample warning (wich was agreed a minimum of 3 hours is good)<br>
FACT at EVEN 1230am PAC peopl are ASLEEP people WORK if you cant clear or have ANY doubts call the BB on call or the next on in rotation.<br>
FACT if a BB declines and a god remains up the RAIDER is held responsible NOT the BB. <br>
EVERY time there si a god up I contact the raiders for both fear and hate, I talk to them, I offer them assistance in anyway. <br>
SR refused any assistance from me.<br>
<br>
Oh yes and as far as the supposed community out cry so far everone (save Wrenfield who asked to cut you some slack and the &lt;Server unknow&gt; dude are the only ones who have disagreed (i dont count the spam of SR on the board)<br>
<br>
You brok the rules, you will be sanctioned. Maybe they are a bit harsh but from the moment I question the circumstances from your guild I got Flamed/threatened/accused and told &quot;your guild made the rules why do we follow them&quot;<br>
Wich is pretty funny since I was guildless up till 6 days ago and before that I was in the Band of the Black hand who never was a part of the process here till I came on the scene about 3 months ago.<br>
<br>
Maybe if SR had someone talk to me in a calm conscise manner and hold there tongue there may have been slightly less, but I doubt it since the facts was posted on the admin board and all the admins posted there agreement of punishment wich has been the standard for first offense.<br>
<br>
If you zone into hate on the day that was removed and kill mobs you will loose all posting rights to the calendar.<br>
And I promise the community will respond like they did with the band of the black hand when they said they would be in fear on jan 5th.<br>

I am still unclear as to which date the admins took away from your guild, but we did not know of this being a disputed date. If you have a problem with the admins please take it up with them.<br>
<br>
We will be in hate on saturday with around 50 of our members. Please respect our posted raid and do not port people into the zone to raid hate. It will just be a mess and probably crash the zone too =( Thanks for hearing me out.<br>
