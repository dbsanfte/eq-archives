I talked with someone in Bots about the BB, and stated that only the amy temple was left and cazic. He said he was going to gather 2-3 groups to kill cazic. We said sure as there was over an hour left in our time. I got a tell later saying not enough interested in doing cazic so it was left at that.<br>
<br>
Do to GM Vaylin going on a power trip fear wasnt even repoped till over and hour and a 1/2 after the server came up. We had less than 6 hours for a total clear and decided to try it, (We had only planned on a single clear and were literally killin the last couple amys from temple when server crashed.) After Vaylin got off the pwer trip we tore through the zone and had everything cleared but the amy temple and cazic. Then most of our east coasters decided they had to log as it was around 3:30am and since the raid was never supposed to be this long had work in a few hours. With a few clerics loggin we called in BB.  We had the power to kill cazic and clear the zone even in the short amount of time we had, plans change shit happens and Bots couldnt get the people in to clear cazic so we left </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unanilyasilverwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanilya Silverwind</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Emef' Aitch</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>33</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3:08:42 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">You knew the rules</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I dunno why people are claiming that they should be immune to punishment for violating rules.  We all know the rules.  Yeah server going down sucks.  Yeah GM being slow sucks.  HOWEVER you had the opportunity to call in help if you were not 100% sure that you could do it.  If you thought you could do it, then you were making a gamble.  You were betting your confidence vs the penalties for breaking the rules in order to get Cazic alone.  You lost, your gamble didn't pay off, take the punishment as it is handed down.  Anybody who gets a repop that late and refuses to call in help is simply gambling with their future on the calendar.  Unless you know for a fact that you can do it (considering all factors like time for east coasters, the 2 am deadline, etc), then you shouldn't even try it.  Recently another guild had failed to call in help until very very late, and they were not punished as far as I know on the grounds that this should not happen again.  If people aren't learing from the mistakes of others then it is time to make an example so people get them message.<br>
<br>
People KNOW the rules, and to try and play your luck with them should not be looked at any differently than simply breaking them blatantly.  If the server crashed at a very late hour and nobody could get Cazic then that is a situation which you had no control over.  You had control, and had a means to ensure that the god would die, yet you did not choose to make that choice in favor of going alone, and praying you could do it.  You guessed wrong.<br>
<br>
If I zone in and kill mobs, and say that I thought that I could get away with it, then I would be blasted left and right.  If people expect us to follow 1 rule, then they need to expect that every rule will be followed.  This isn't a situation where you follow some of the rules all of the time, or all of the rules some of the time.  We all have to follow all of the rules all of the time, whether we like it or not, because it is what we agreed and pledged to do.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uilystildrakonblayde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ilystil Drakonblayde</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Wog</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>33</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>5:43:31 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://ilystil.home.mindspring.com/ilystil.gif WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=200></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: You knew the rules</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">The server came back up approx 7:30 est.... so an hour and a half means repop at 9est, which is still 8 hours to clear the plane.<br>

There is no excuse for the actions taken that night. There was atleast 7+ hours to clear the POF and there was ample time to call in the BB wich was not taken.<br>

I have heard stories from 5 people now, and one person from your guild flameing me because I asked to talk to the GL.<br>

I am not the &quot;rule&quot; maker as some of your members swear to, I only here to make sure rules are followed that you agreed on, if you have a problem with a rule call a vote to change/adjust/edit it.<br>

The person I talked to in Bots even said they would bring 2-3 groups in to help finish cazic and it didnt happen. While an hour and a 1/2 might not be enough to clear get there and clear amy temple and cazic its very dooable. At 4:30 he responded with a tell saying not enough were interested. Not to mention it has been stated MANY times the 5am deadline doesnt take effect if a god is up. Its not like the zone was full pop. for BB to come in kill 15 mobs and cazic in an hour and a 1/2 is plenty of time. Id believe it was to short of a time if mobs like venril sathir and Trak and countless other didnt have a life span of 30 minutes after server resets. <br>
<br>
As for the server yea it came up at 7:30 but it took another 45 minutes for people to log on from congestion then an hour and a 1/2 for the zone to be repoped. It was nearly 10pm when Vaylin finally did it. We had the pace that was ahead of schedule and if people werent falling asleep at keyboards would have done it easily. Some of us have RL's and arent going to risk jobs and such over a cazic so we decided to call BB and get outta there asap. <br>
<br>
And im still not sure which &quot;rule&quot; we broke but hey whatever, checks the rules there is no offical time to call in BB that I see, just a discussion with no offical time coming from it.  As I stated when I talked to the person in BoTs he said they would be there with at least 2 full groups all 55+ and possibly a 3rd depending on how much he yelled. Then 30 minutes later I get a tell saying not enough are interested so I asked others whats going on and just get a reply of &quot;were thinking about killin cazic&quot;. So we called in BB and they didnt want to come, is this a slam against BoTs.. no the BB just didnt come so it was left at that. </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uemilsinclair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emil Sinclair</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Blood of the Spider</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>65</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>10:14:45 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: *sigh*</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">we werent asked till like 3am...EDIT(cst, my time)<br>

I think Evilrulz and his guild (I have no idea what guild we are talking about here sorry 8/ ) did right to &quot;invite&quot; people to loot items that would have rot. <br>
And if I get it right the server went down during the raid? and they began on a second cleaning?<br>
I really see no wrong in clearing as much as the time said and then call in BB. They had 6 hours and I'm sure they planned on cleaning it all the way (can be done I think).. but &quot;failed&quot;.<br>
But this really didn't effect the guild that raided fear the next day did it? If it didn't I don't see why people are complaining... <br>
<br>
Sure we want the rules to be respected, but it's not our work to tell the guilds what to do and not to do.. I think that's an admin job.<br>
Maybe we should stop flaming mistakes and let admins handle it instead.<br>

Usually that is what happens and odds are that is what will happen this time. As you said they gambled and lost. More than likely they will lose any current raids that are posted and will not be able to post new ones for a month.<br>
<br>
This isn't finalized but it's what has been done a few times in the past in similar situations. I think we currently have 2 guilds waiting to get posting rights back.<br>

Secondly we were AHEAD of schedule. With an hour and 1/2 left in our time we had amy temple ONLY and cazic. This isnt like we are callin in Bots and saying theres an hour left mind clearing all of fear. It 15 mobs or so and a god. <br>
<br>
And reguardless of what you think we refuse to goto the planes (Planes are a LOOT ONLY ZONE, ppl do not go there to get ex) and let 75% of the loot rot. The more people that get there plane gear the less guilds that need postin rights. I guess were not uber greedy like several other guilds and have the attitude of we cant use then no one gets.  The whole calendar system is in place cause too many people want in planes for loot, way to make the system fail by wanting loot to rot rather than let people in who need loot. <br>
<br>
For Rew who is too all knowing to read the rules.....<br>
<br>
Taken Directly from the rules..<br>
Of course you may invite friends on raids. Because you need the class, because they are good friends, because you need help, or because you don't want loot to rot. What you may NOT do is use your relationship with another posting entity so that you all may go twice per round. If you have another guild you are always teaming with, you need to form an alliance and in this way you are only entitled to one day per round, like everyone else. Also in this way one guild may not be used as a front for another guild. If you have ANY questions, or need ANY clarifications I highly recommend posting them early. The more serious the violation the more serious the penalty, and trust me this will be the rule most closely watched. <br>
<br>
Valiant Knights has no posting rights therefore we arent using this to get 2 raids a month or whatever. If you want to label it an allaince fine though this was the 1st time we ever did anything with them. There is no front just a smaller guild needing planes equip. <br>
<br>
<br>
Emil is just about on the button on the time we called them, though I had been talking with someone a little bit before this, the actual time he presented it to BoTs I have no idea. But as I stated the time is a moot point the zone was 95% clear and believe it or not that was a decent amount of time.<br>
<br>
SO my question is what rule did we break, I showed you the rules about the invites and we didnt break that and as for calling in the BB we did, or did we break a rule that doesnt even exist yet but might in the future, if you want a specific time for BB to be called in then get together and post it, dont make a forum that takes suggestions and never has a final answer come out then hold guilds to that. </font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uevilrulz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evilrulz</A> at: 3/6/01 11:56:35 am</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urewena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rewena</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>RTA WebAdmin</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>364</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12:12:07 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: *sigh*</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">You don't need to quote me the rules, but you did get my name right this time.<br>

If the rules are wrong then change them. It cant be expected that everyone that plays read every single post on ever single subject. Not to mention the post states exactly what I said. Rew (sorry bout the Ren) we didnt call in VK to kill cazic they were there on the 1st clear also. They were there to loot and thats it. We didnt plan on the server going down it just did. And yes once again we did call BB, we were ahead of schedule to clear the plane before our time (so there was no reason to nitify a BB, if we had fallen behind schedule we would have) just that people were fallin asleep and risking RL jobs over fear. If we didnt respect the large guilds we never would have called bots. I find it hard to believe a guild like Bots needs 3 hours to gather for fear with a tele right in ferrott. How long does it take bots to start to finish on trak????, they had very little to kill and a fair amount of time to do it, yea it wasnt a lot but BoTs rarely seems to need tons of time to gather 2-3 groups. I not mad at Rew personally but just get annoyed gettin trashed for &quot;breakin&quot; rules when we didnt break any. The rules state postin guilds only so we didnt see us breakin any rules here, We also DID call BB and there is no specific time set for them to be called. So once again another rule we didnt break. If you want to ban us for the month to make you feel better due to personal dislike for us fine whatever floats your boat just say so, but dont come in saying we broke all these rules that we didnt, we followed the rules posted under rules and didnt use any &quot;guess work&quot; on them. The suggested time of 11pm or whatever it is, is based on a total zone clear not a few mobs, and still there is nothing finalized about it.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uevilrulz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evilrulz</A> at: 3/6/01 12:41:27 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usolareesmarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Solarees Marr</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Legends of Marr</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>20</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12:39:38 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: *sigh*</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">i thought we finalized a NLT call time of 10pm pst?</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufoladen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>foladen</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>NCS</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>279</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12:46:14 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: *sigh*</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">nothing formal has been posted on it.<br>

I agree that they violated the spirit of the BB, though.<br>
<br>
Rule 5 really should be changed to add a time; eg, BB MUST be called by XPM PST. If god is left up, violation will be considered to have occured.<br>
<br>
Something along those lines? Seems pretty straightforward to my simple mind.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> </font><P>Gorgash Spiritmaul <BR>
