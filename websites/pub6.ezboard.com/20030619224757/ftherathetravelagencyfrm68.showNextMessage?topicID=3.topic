No one is really talking about it either because you just don't criticize anything having to do with September 11th. Well, I just can't let the numbers pass by because it says something really disturbing about the entitlement mentality of this country. <br>
<br>
If you lost a family member in the September 11th attack, you're going to get an average of $1,185,000. The range is a minimum guarantee of $250,000, all the way up to $4.7 million. <br>
<br>
If you are a surviving family member of an American soldier killed in action, the first check you get is a $6,000 direct death benefit, half of which is taxable. Next, you get $1,750 for burial costs. If you are the surviving spouse, you get $833 a month until you remarry. And there's a payment of $211 per month for each child under 18. When the child hits 18, those payments come to a screeching halt. <br>
<br>
Keep in mind that some of the people that are getting an average of $1.185 million up to $4.7 million are complaining that it's not enough. <br>
<br>
We also learned over the weekend that some of the victims from the Oklahoma City bombing have started an organization asking for the same deal that the September 11th families are getting.. In addition to that, some of the families of those bombed in the embassies are now asking for compensation as well. <br>
<br>
You see where this is going, don't you? <br>
<br>
Folks, this is part and parcel of over fifty years of entitlement politics in this country. It's just really sad. <br>
<br>
Every time when pay raise comes up for the military they usually receive next to nothing of a raise. Now the green machine is in combat in the Middle East while their families have to survive on food stamps and live in low rent housing. <br>
<br>
However our own U.S. Congress just voted themselves a raise, and many of you don't know that they only have to be in Congress one-time to receive a pension that is more than $15,000 per month and most are now equal to be millionaires plus. They also do not receive Social Security on retirement because they didn't have to pay into the system. If some of the military people stay in for 20 years and get out as an E-7 you may receive a pension of $1,000 per month, and the very people who placed you in harm's way receive a pension of $15,000 per month. <br>
<br>
I would like to see our elected officials pick up a weapon and join ranks before they start cutting out benefits and lowering pay for our sons and daughters who are now fighting. <br>
<br>
&quot;When do we finally do something about this?&quot; <br>

They are paid to fight, and know what goes into that beforehand.<br>
<br>
The victims of Sep 11 had no idea that their life was  at risk from a &quot;military&quot; attack. They entered no agreement to be paid to take the risk of dying, and werent getting extra that day for &quot;emminent danger&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now, let me say that I agree with you that a good deal of the families of Sep 11 have gotten substantially too much money, and those forming the groups for th OK bombing are now just looking for a buck.<br>
<br>
Both of these things are tradgedies, but there is still another point to be made. The majority of the money bestowed upon the 9/11 vicims families was from charity. The red cross gave the majority of that money, followed, I beleive by the united way. The government gave the families very little if any (my original understanding was the normal $250 burial endorsment, but I would have to check to see if that was all).<br>
<br>
I agree with your points, jsut not your premises. There are many reasons to be sure that we compensate certain people for the benefits they provide us. The military, cops, teachers, doctors (they actually get it though). Sadly, we pay our lawyers and stock brokers and Bill Gates most of our money. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen<br>
