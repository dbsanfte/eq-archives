<br>
A.  If the posting entity in the plane knows they can not kill the god before the 2am PST deadline they must call in the Epic/BB guild before 9pm PST.  If the call for the BB/Epic guild does not occur by 9pm PST then the responsiblity of the god dieing falls upon the shoulders of the posting entity in the plane that night.<br>
<br>
B.  If an Epic/BB guild is called in to kill a god, the 2am PST ending time shall be extended to 4am PST.<br>
<br>
Penalties for leaving a god up will be discussed in another thread. <p>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

I agree with Nycah's idea as well.  Its too bad the BB guilds havn't been doing that isn't it?  <br>
<br>
And the fact that 2 out of the last 3 guilds &quot;thought&quot; they could take CT down.<br>
<br>
I really wish we didn't need more rules, because they confuse things, but they seem to be needed.<br>
<br>
Nycah's idea is something that is solely within the grasp of the BB up on rotation, new rules are something the calendar as a system can do.<br>
<br>
So, as a person who believes the system as a whole is good, and thinks it in general works, I am taking what steps I can to see the system work.  I can not control whether the BB guild contacts the scheduled raiding parties.  I can only try to modify the system such that if they do not make that contact the system can work around it. <p>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

Setting the notify time to 9pm gives you five hours from notification to clear the plane.  And how about the epic guild handling the initial communication?  Since the epics have done such a craptastic job of handling their rotation information, it's VERY difficult for anyone to know precisely who is up, sometimes.<br>
<br>
If you want to do something else that night, notify the next in line for the notification, and bump yourself to the bottom of the list.<br>
<br>
Don't like the idea of being bumped to the bottom of the list?  Make sure you're ready to go in at a moment's notice, then.  Your responsibility as an on-call epic guild is to make sure the god dies.  Not to make sure you get god loot with a minimum of hassle on your part.<br>
<br>
If you're a person who works an on-call job, you don't get to say &quot;only do on calls for me from 9pm to midnight.  before that i want to watch tv and the calls might be hard to get to before then.&quot; <br>
<br>
But hey, at least we're talking now, and 'FFA' isn't in every other sentence. heh.<br>
<br>
How about all the epic guilds get reps in game tonight and have a meeting to hash out what the epic guilds want to do for handling rotation/rules/punishment/etc.<br>
<br>
I've only been suggesting that for, like, a week.<br>
<br>
Because if the epic guilds can't be civil to each other long enough to come up with an agreeable set of rules for the epic rotation system, then that part of the calendar is doomed, and we may as well just make it an 'FYI' list for guilds to notify and pull up Big Brother to take down a god.<br>

If you are up, and so is the god... You shouldn't BE &quot;doing something else&quot;. This responsibility is one of the driving reasons that RoS will decline to become &quot;Epic&quot; when we qualify (which we will eventually, probably very soon). We don't want to be tied down whenever it's our turn, and a god is up. We don't want to have the responsibility of having enough people on and ready to go in and kill Cazic at a moment's notice, with little time. The benefit of getting the epic loot just isn't worth the hassle. Yes, we have many people waiting on that epic loot to finish their quests, but we'll wait our turn...<br>
<br>
Perhaps some of the current guilds need to reevaluate whether they really want that responsibility... Because, in accepting the &quot;Epic&quot; title, you do assume that responsibility.<br>

Stygar makes a valid point.  If the guild has any question its best to have them call in early then to call in late.  Communication is the key.<br>
<br>
Also do we decide 9 is early enough? or is 8 better?  It doesn't matter to me as long as time is set up.<br>

<br>
Why not get a list of entities that have actually killed a God. If the guild who is up, has not killed the God, let BB send as many as need from the start. The less experienced guild would then learn from people who &quot;should&quot; know what they are doing.<br>
<br>
The BB guild that is up, should take initiative to get in touch with the guild in the plane. Verify that they can, or cannot kill the God, then notify the Admins of the situation. <br>
<br>
This should make a 2am finish very achievable.<br>
2am will be documented as the end of a raid no matter what. If the BB does not get the kill within that time frame, the next BB  is up. No excuses. Server drops, tough luck, those are the breaks. <br>
<br>
<br>
New rule: BB can NOT be called in the day before they have a Plane.. We can call this the FR rule.<br>
<br>
New rule: BB can not be in the plane on God days if a capable guild is in the Plane. If a BB member has a trade arranged, he will wait outside till the God is dead.<br>
<br>
New rule: Sky will support Fri/Sat raids for people going to the top. Sat/Sun raids for people staying below. The Admins will determine if you are capable to reserve Friday starts.<br>
<br>
New rule: Anyone breaking the rules will lose 1 raid on 1st offense. 2nd offense 45 days no posting rights. 3rd offense banned from The Rathe calendar for 90 days.<br>
<br>
Entities must be held accountable for breaking the rules. If not then we cannot have a Calendar.<br>
<br>
We need to have a rules enforcement commitee. Need some ideas on who should be on this commitee. Maybe 50+ member entities get 1 rep?<br>

I think all guild reps should post their &quot;rules&quot; they want included here.  Stygar has quite a few up that have been talked about so I will give input on them.<br>
<br>
8pm PST to call in BB.  Works for me.<br>
<br>
List of guilds who have killed CT.  Works for me but when that guild that hasn't killed CT wants to take their shot &quot;realistically&quot; then we let em do it.<br>
<br>
Communication is key to any raid.  BB up should be the one to initiate the talks.<br>
<br>
2am finish time is fine with me.  (one possible problem--server crash after the call in time.  BB gets called in at say 11pm PST after a server crash.  Should we give them a flat out 4 hours? 5?  Should the god stay up for the next days raid?)  Also how strict are we going to be with this.  Is 1 minute over punishable?(clocks all are off more then that in my house alone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  Is 5 minutes?  Is 10?  We need input here.<br>
<br>
:::New rule: BB can NOT be called in the day before they have a Plane.. We can call this the FR rule.:::<br>
<br>
I need more clarification on this.  I see if a BB drags their feet clearing they could possibly get the god all to themselves.  Is that the reason for this rule?<br>
<br>
<br>
:::New rule: BB can not be in the plane on God days if a capable guild is in the Plane. If a BB member has a trade arranged, he will wait outside till the God is dead.:::<br>
<br>
I agree on this 100%.<br>
<br>
:::New rule: Sky will support Fri/Sat raids for people going to the top. Sat/Sun raids for people staying below. The Admins will determine if you are capable to reserve Friday starts.:::<br>
<br>
I can see why this is needed.  It maximizes the plane usage.  Siren spawns would have to be shared of course.  Does everyone understand why this is good though?<br>
<br>
::::New rule: Anyone breaking the rules will lose 1 raid on 1st offense. 2nd offense 45 days no posting rights. 3rd offense banned from The Rathe calendar for 90 days.::::<br>
<br>
I think more clarification is needed here.  Good start but we need everyone's input on this I feel.  We do need some sort of punishment I agree.  But then again we fall on the &quot;PnP&quot; line that you can't enforce this crap on me blah blah.  This will need everyone's ratification.  Also I like the idea of a &quot;jury&quot; of sorts to be set up.  They can vote on infractions.  Perhaps they can also deal out the punishment.<br>

It isn't epic_guild_01's raid.  Its another entities raid that the epic guild helps out on.  When you have a guild having problems clearing Fear then they may not know all the little tricks that the epic guilds take for granted now.<br>
<br>
Having to explain tactics takes time.  Having to CR a group takes time.  Having to round up folks at night takes time.  There are many reasons an epic guild would need this much time.  But the bottom line is this.  The god dies BEFORE 2am with 8pm PST call in.<br>
<br>
Thing is if you can kill the god go for it.  If you need help call in the epic guild by 8pm PST.  That is what is being proposed.  State your opinions based on that knowledge.<br>

Also, I'm far too tired atm to drum up any suggestions.  I will make an attempt to sort thru these threads and consult some officers to see where we stand.<br>

<br>
Reduce bb invites to 2 or 3<br>

OR<br>
<br>
If a BB member is in the plane on a night a god is up and recieves an epic piece (outside normal trades) they get droped to the back fo the rotation.<br>

<br>
8 PST is fine with me.<br>
<br>
A list of guilds that have killed each god is a good idea.  And if they have not killed a god, AND they want the help the BB can send in as many as they want from the start.  However, at some time we have to let each guild stand on its own, how else will they ever know if they an kill the god alone.<br>
<br>
I agree the BB guild up should always be in contact with the guild in the planes when a god is up.  And if it looks like both Fear and Hate might need help, they should contact the next BB guild and inform them of that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> New rule: BB can NOT be called in the day before they have a Plane.. We can call this the FR rule.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmm... I guess this will work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> New rule: BB can not be in the plane on God days if a capable guild is in the Plane. If a BB member has a trade arranged, he will wait outside till the God is dead.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Or thier next BB turn is skipped, but they are left in the same place in the rotation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> New rule: Sky will support Fri/Sat raids for people going to the top. Sat/Sun raids for people staying below. The Admins will determine if you are capable to reserve Friday starts.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not sure about the Admins determining the capablity, but I guess that will work.  I agree with the sharing of the days though.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> New rule: Anyone breaking the rules will lose 1 raid on 1st offense. 2nd offense 45 days no posting rights. 3rd offense banned from The Rathe calendar for 90 days.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We need to have a rules enforcement commitee. Need some ideas on who should be on this commitee. Maybe 50+ member entities get 1 rep?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Wouldn't this be most posting entities?  At least half of them?  How many reps do we want?<br>

<br>
If the idea is gods dieing ASAP, then we need to let the current BB guild get up there and take the god up.  So, I would say 5 hours after the server coming up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Also how strict are we going to be with this. Is 1 minute over punishable?(clocks all are off more then that in my house alone  ) Is 5 minutes? Is 10? We need input here.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I think this is one of the areas where the Admins might have to make the choise on a case by case instance.  But I would think 15-20 mins would not hurt much. <p>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

Maybe only peep who have been in game since Beta? It also needs to be made of people who are not afraid to make a hard decision.<br>
<br>
I really think on a late server drop our hands are tied. How long does it take GM's to repop zones? I can live with an extra hour at most added to the BB in this situation. If we gave them 5 hours, it may not get done till 7am. This basically screws the next day raids 100%. I think a 15 minute grace period is ok to extend to all raids in a plane.<br>
<br>
Maybe if a guild has never killed a god, have BB send in 2 groups to begin with. If it starts getting late, bring in a full force.<br>
<br>
On the number of BB people allowed into a plane om God days when it is not their turn I still have to say none. Whats to stop uber_kissass_01 from leapfrogging other guilds? Even if we allowed it to move the guild to end of list, they could still kiss enough ass to leapfrog as many times as they could manage. I see no answer to this but implementing no BB on God days period.<br>
<br>
Someone needs to step up and post a full version of these rules. Put a deadline to ratify. And stick to it. These are as fair as we are going to get IMO. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uedwinanytengayle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EdwinaNytengayle</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/6/01 11:40:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.iland.net/~jewell/Ed_thumb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Proposal: BB Guild Call in Time</span><hr size=1> Qwai, when you put your mind to it, you can come up with some reasonable ideas.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
Having a hard set end time of 2am PST.  I don't like this, but *if* the Epic is called NLT 8pm PST, I can see it.  However, what about those situations where at 8pm, everything is going well, but by 10pm it's gone to hell in a handbasket?  The posting entity can, and should, call Epic, but will there be enough time to get stuff done?  Let the posting entity, Epic, and next days raid talk.  See if something can be worked out for Epic to stay later (no more than 2 hours).<br>
<br>
Epic cannot be called-in if they have the plane the next day.  Why?  Allow this, but stipulate that regardless how late it runs, that the posting entity gets the god loot, minus any epic item for Epic.<br>
<br>
Members of an Epic not on call in the plane when a god is up.  Change this to no more than 2 invites.<br>
<br>
Sky piggyback.  Allow any entity to post for Fri/Sat; however, if the entity does not get past Isle 4 on Fri, and the entity behind them will, the first entity jumps.  Even experienced entities who have accomplished getting thru Sky can have problems, and *could* interfere with the entity coming up behind them breathing down their necks.<br>
<br>
As for punishments, a precedent has already been set.  Solorees was bound and determined to get his guild thru the plane and slay CT, but did not, and did not call-in Epic.  After extensive conversation, they were suspended from posting for 30 days (tho they did keep their Hate raid). <p><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Edwina Nytengayle<br> </strong></font></center>

<br>
When a BB/Epic Guild is called in, it should be *only* members of that guild, <br>
<br>
For instance: if Guild A is a BB guild, and they are called in, but do not have enough members on-line, they should not be able to have Guild B, who is NOT a BB/Epic Guild *help* them.<br>
<br>
I believe that if a Guild gains the BB/Epic Status, then ONLY those who are in said Guild should be allowed to assist in bringing down a God.<br>
<br>
And NO, no temporary tagging allowed, either.  <p>Nycah Aries'Syrensong<BR>
