Dried sweat, like a gymnasium. They’d closed the underground, weeks ago, left the doors open and hanging on the hinges. There was a time when this giant concrete room was packed so full that I couldn’t move, couldn’t get from where I was to where I needed to be for the press of small bodies, small people, dancing and gyrating in seizures, small circles of blur and movement, all intermingling with the people next to them. <br>
<br>
The floor was as I’d always remembered it before a busy night. Stained in places, but clear of any surface dirt or debris. I looked around, the concrete blocks still standing where they had always been, though rattled and shaken on several occasions. The DJ booth still stood in the back corner of the room, wire mesh and steel siding a makeshift barrier against the crowd. The room oppressed me, with the silence and dullness of the air. No one moving, not even me now, as I surveyed the room, silently. Coming back to this place, again, at this time in my life, closed off feelings that I didn’t know were still open. <br>
<br>
I’d never been here alone. No matter how often I’d worked, I’d always arrived after the crew to set up had started their work, always come in at the middle of the speakers coming together and the bar stocking for the night. Tonight, the main lights were not hooked up, and the eerie brightness of the emergency lighting was all that made the shadows around the room. Normally, blues and golds, greens and red lights would dance around the room, reflect off the hangings that were not on the ceiling tonight. They’d hang old CD’s and let the lights reflect off them in the strangest ways. Everything tonight was sterile. So blank and unforgiving in the light, like an operating room. The concrete under my feet was familiar, but so strangely cold now that I could hardly find the strength to move, let alone to walk the old borders of the room, now bare, and stripped down to nothing. Even the posters, the fliers that always heralded the next show, the next weekend, were down, cleaned off the wall, even the years old staples and pins were removed, the paint fresh. <br>
<br>
The quiet room was closed, padlocked from the outside, since it had shelves large enough to be bunks that were not removable. After the building closed, people broke in to see if there was anything to steal, but they’d be looking for a place to sleep if they’d find one. Just as well, my home was not the quiet room. <br>
<br>
The backdoor stairwell, boards missing, is now even more of a death trap than it ever was before. The backdoor looks to be chained shut from the inside, loops of chain wrapped around the old steel oil tank that held the fuel that once kept this area of the building warm in the winter. The pipes on the tank had been disconnected, and the only thing keeping the door from swinging open was the bulk of the now useless tank. The boards that were inexplicably missing made it impossible to walk down the stairs, and made coming back up at least equally challenging. It wasn’t important enough to me to risk it anyway, and so my tour was over, for the most part. I found myself lingering, just a few moments, over the feeling of the place, now so empty and barren. <br>
<br>
If there were a ghost to this place, I would suppose I was it. I rode the wave of the popularity, I was the back door man, and knew everyone, everyone knew me. Now, all that is known is the cold concrete and gray of the paint on the walls. Not long after I walked off the job, there was a falling out, the building ceased to see use, people stopped coming, other places opened that were better, more comfortable, cheaper, in better parts of town. I felt, looking back at this place now, that as I walked, I’d pulled the color away from it, as I left, it all trailed behind me, every step away making the air stale, taking the memories with me as I did. <br>
<br>
I spun on my heels, angry all of a sudden, at the barren fate that this place has before it. The owner sold it, the new owner wants to tear it down, rebuild something different on the old foundations. It will stand, empty inside and strong against the outside, the doors broken and forgotten, ready to be used again, until the day that it is deconstructed. When it is torn down, all at once. <br>
<br>
It was once a place of pounding bass and pulse, heartbeats and breathing, alive, and living. Now, it stands empty, and slipping long from the memory of everyone who’d ever been here. And more than anything else I’ve ever known, I can sympathize with this building. Being here, in the shades of all that happened to me in this place, all the crush of bodies I’ve seen, and been in the middle of, flesh to flesh, bone on bone, the pain and the laughter, I can feel the emptiness creep from the walls and floor of this barren building. I can absorb it, and welcome it, as I take my steps deliberately from this place, I know that I am again taking a part of it with me, removing from it as I go, the parts that the building wants me to remember, that it wants me to feel. The emptiness shadows my feet, each echoing footstep growing softer and softer until I step onto the sidewalk with a crunch of loose pebble on pavement, and slide into my car. The door slamming rings against the building, a final breath of sound. My car stereo now makes the noise, as I roll away into the night, I know that the building will never again be filled with the frantic pace of drumming, the electronic blasts that once drove people into a frenzy of arms, legs, chest to chest, breathing in and out together, the air from each others lungs. <br>
<br>
Just as I know that the empty follows with me, I know that the building has already died. <br>
<br>
I wished there was a place like it again, a home for me, that felt quite as real as ever this one did. <br>
<br>
<br>
My Way (Frank Sinatra)<br>
<br>
And now the end is near<br>
And so I face, the final curtain<br>
My friend, I'll say it clear,<br>
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain<br>
I've lived a life that's full, I've travelled each and every highway,<br>
And what's more, much more than this, I did it my way<br>
<br>
Regrets, I've had a few, <br>
but then again, too few to mention<br>
I did what I had to do,<br>
and saw it through without exemption<br>
<br>
I planned each charted course, and each careful step along the byways<br>
and more, much more than this, I did it my way. <br>
<br>
Yes there were times I'm sure you knew, <br>
when I bit off more than I could chew, <br>
but through it all, when there was doubt, <br>
I ate it up and spit it out<br>
<br>
I faced it all, and I stood tall, and did it my way...<br>
I've loved and laughed and cried. <br>
I've had my fill, my share of losing<br>
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing<br>
To think, I'd did all that, and may I say, not in a shy way, <br>
oh no, oh no, not me, I did it my way. <br>
<br>
For what is a man, what has he got, <br>
if not himself than he has naught, <br>
to say the things he truly feels <br>
and not the words of one who kneels, <br>
the record shows, <br>
I took the blows and did it my way. <br>
<br>

Very well done .. your attention to detail always catches me, makes me FEEL. <br>
  That said it reminded me in a bittersweet way of my divorce... the original years of feeling a part of it.. the emptyness i felt that hounded me seeming ageless and a stalker to my soul when i realized it was over.. and then when i finally picked myself up with the realization i had to carry on .  Bittersweet yes. but thank you for making me FEEL as i know i am moving forward. with a sense of purpose but never forgetting the past , and yet still yearning for that sense of *belonging* again.<br>
<br>
I have no idea if this is what this is all about in your always subtle manner *smiles* but it made me *feel* and that is always a good sign.<br>
<br>
Good addition to your submissions !!!!<br>
