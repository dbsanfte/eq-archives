The original argument is pretty goofy, basically:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">There's plenty to do so why schedule things? </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Well, if there is plenty to do why are you worried about the small number of things on schedules?  There must still be plenty of FFA content right?<br>
<br>
Personally I like the schedules.  I'd rather wait till a spot in the queue than burn all that energy organizing a significant raid force and showing up somewhere to find it camped.  There is a lot of content, but there are a lot of players too.  And key content gets a lot of traffic.  <br>
<br>
If a significant raid force is required to take something down, and it's a desireable encounter, then it just makes sense to put it on a schedule.<br>
<br>
Not being guilded, but having a wide circle of friends, perhaps you don't appriciate the energy that goes into organizing big encounters?  You have the freedom to just squirt out a few tell and then pick what guild you want to ride the coat tails of - most people dont.  To many people the sheduled events represent a big effort and showing up and getting bumped is a major pain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/14/03 2:06:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=82>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AL</span><hr size=1> One comment:  Raifin is my new hero.<br>

<br>
No, it didn’t stop me.  You chose to start with telling me what NB should be doing, so I offered some counter advice (again, normally a topic I avoid with other guilds/guildleaders).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I don't play this game for fruitful or easy. Sorry I have real life for being careful, I like to take advantage of the fact that this is a video game and take some risks. We have little interest in repeating NB's pattern of over-farming and advancing too slowly (this has been admitted by an NB member, I believe either you or Borick in reference to when you entered NToV - you were overprepared I believe was the phrase). FK has a lot of player drive and we push for risky fights because that drive is wasted and we end up with a lot of dull wordy farmers if we give no outlet to this drive.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I was being nice using the words “not fruitful and easy” – and I meant them in the way that bind rushing AoW is “not fruitful or easy”.  There is a difference between a challenge and beyond the realm of reasonable expectation.  N ToV is a challenge for you guys, Emperor is beyond the realm of reasonable expectation (as you guys don’t have enough keys).  The other Ssra bosses fall in between, depending on which you want to think about.<br>
<br>
As for NB’s “pattern of over-farming and advancing too slowly”, you obviously don’t know the history of what you’re talking about.  If you’d like I could provide you with the history of why NB went with CoV faction first, and how it was to lessen conflict with other guilds (namely BOTS, SoT, RF, KEG all being Giant faction, W ToV being a small place for five guilds, and HoT armor having better stats/resists).  As for Borick’s comment about us being overprepared for N TOV, we were stuck getting a return on our investment from Dozekar, so going for N TOV early wasn’t really an option when we were still farming HoT and doing Doze quests.  Time spent fixing that much faction is time spent stagnating.  Instead of sitting idle, we farmed primal for the power increase it gives, and that has helped immensely over time.  Go ahead and take your potshots at my long posts and the farming only NB does (/sarcasm off).  I’ll just be sure to send you tells from Vex Thal so we can discuss all of FK’s intense “player drive” and “risky” Velious and Luclin fights.  Of course, if you really had all that drive, you could follow your own advice and take up the even more challenging fights of getting into Tactics or Sol Ro yourselves and send us tells. . .  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I liken this to people telling VoF how many clerics they need for AoW - they know how many they need leave them the fuck alone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Exactly, I know what it takes to get to Tactics and Sol Ro.  Currently, that involves over 1000 shards and 100 orbs.  So maybe not be so hasty to offer us advice on how to go forward?  Remember, you’re the one who offered advice (mistakenly) on why we shouldn’t be doing Arch Lich anymore.<br>

Agreed they are minor details but so are these:<br>
<br>
1)  The add room we ran into only had a few players go LD and NB clerics made sure to make up the healing difference until the room was stabilized and we backed out.<br>
<br>
2) Our presence had nothing to do with any adds, as we weren't in the XTC room nor the XTC prep room (which is not the Jail, where you were fighting adds).<br>

Vincecross, i assume you speak with two tongues here. was it not you that said it doesn't matter how people wipe out, they notified the channel that they were in the zone and going after a certain mob?<br>
<br>
while waiting for more to show up, the chanters were bored, and began taunting the pullers to see how much they can bring. test themselves too i'm sure. i think they pulled the entire mines. we will probably try this again i'm sure as well. either way, we wiped, and were quickly cr'ing when karadin asked why our numbers were low.<br>
<br>
sylph wasn't even in the channel i believe, and so never said we died from AE due to a TM. i certainly never did either, contrary to the bs that is being posted on this thread. jurrasic wasn't even online at the time.<br>
<br>
i do recall fere saying it was 'from AE', which was true. i really didn't think it was anyone's business personally, but fere did try to respond. he wasn't present for the AE, so he got his response from asking in /gu. i believe you, vincecross, were the one to begin commenting as though it was from a TM. i am not sure how the warden died. i didn't think it mattered since others in the RTA channel, including yourself vince, said the attempt was ours. this changed when karadin entered the channel.<br>

comments like these is why i compare you to wormtongue vincecross. you are not hanging onto karadin's robe anymore. speak with your own leaders if they aren't passing everything by you. perhaps it was done for a good reason. we have definitely inquired many times to guilds about rotations in ssra and out. the result of which, is why fere posted. your ignorant deceiptful comment only shows how full of bs you are. perhaps if you are unable to be hear what smaller guilds have to say, it is time for you to resign as RTA Admin.<br>
<br>
i was going to comment on the rest of your bs posts; however, in your hunger for power, i honestly believe it would fall on deaf ears. you obviously have no intention to listen, dispite being a RTA Admin. you made your vote on punishment recently, then AFTER, asked what the punishment you were voting on was. it's disgusting. yes, i have a log of it. representing the rathe community in a fair way, is not what your recent actions have shown. if you like your position as mediator in the rta channel, start acting like it.. or please resign.<br>

No, I didn’t ask why your numbers were low.  41 people isn’t a low number.  I asked why you hadn’t already initiated the cycle, but some TMs were already dead.<br>
<br>
{quote]sylph wasn't even in the channel i believe, and so never said we died from AE due to a TM. i certainly never did either, contrary to the bs that is being posted on this thread. jurrasic wasn't even online at the time.[/quote]<br>
<br>
Sylph most certainly was in the channel, and yes, all of you fell all over yourselves to say that you died from a TM *who had an AE*, not from an AE pull from the mines.<br>
<br>
I would ask that Vince or Thund or Emil post the log of that part of the conversation, but in lieu of that – I will simply point you to THIS thread, wherein Fere said:<br>

There IS no such TM with an AE.  Fere insisted on it, as did you and Sylph.<br>

<br>
It matters a ton how the Warden and wandering TM died.  All the TMs have to be killed within a certain amount of time or you blow the cycle for two hours.  Killing even one, and then letting time pass is *stalling*, which Fere, Sylph and you claimed you weren’t doing, because “you tried starting it with 28, but wiped to the AE TM and friends”.  No you didn’t wipe to an AE TM that doesn’t exist, you died to an AE mines pull of your own making and killed the TMs to stall NB from being able to take our turn before you could get more forces on.  You then sent a friend of mine to ask if we wouldn’t mind passing, with all this subterfuge already in place.  Not a good way to play nice, and hence my question to you about playing hardball.<br>

I don’t wear a robe, I’m a chain class.  And even when Vince was in NB he and I rarely shared the same side of an argument.  As for you asking about mobs in or out of Ssra, I have been asked once, the night of Cursed, full of subterfuge behind the question, and by a friend of mine, not the leadership of FK.  I have also heard of you guys asking Tindi, about Cursed, the week before, the night of.  You haven’t asked NB about XTC, HP, AL, or Blood in Ssra, and no mob outside of Ssra either.  To be fair to you though, Ssra mobs are the only Luclin mobs we still do regularly, so obviously you wouldn’t talk to us about mobs outside of Ssra.<br>

i don't believe you are intentionally lying, as there were lots of ppl in the channel contradicting this statement. ..but please request the logs from someone who was present if you don't believe me. i have no reason to say we died from a TM AE. sylph never said a word. less hate.<br>

<br>
Not at all.  If you want to try any mob, feel free to go right ahead, just beat whatever guild is currently up for it.  The only thing that we ask is that you don't spawn camp it on failures.  If you fail, move on and let some others have a shot at it.<br>
<br>
&quot;when TL could blow 4+ AoW spawns trying to get on rotation&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't think this happened, and if it did, see the above and ask them (Tindi) about Emperor.<br>
<br>
&quot;But are you truly a villain for wanting to achieve a victory on a mob without the prior expressed written consent of a rotation guild at least one day in advance? What the fuck ever happened to making it on your own anymore? &quot;<br>
<br>
See above.<br>
<br>
&quot;Also, I wanted to add that FK, due to being a PST-time based guild, is an extreme of the situation, of one who is best served by a rotation if we are on it, but hurt most by barriers to entry.&quot;<br>
<br>
MOST guilds will give you a shot if you ask in advance, because of your time zone.  I know that BotS, NB, and Tindi have all been amiable to this in the past.<br>
<br>
<br>
-- What Karadin said<br>
<br>
&quot;a couple members got jumped by the wandering warden when watching all the TL funnel out of the tube, and we did kill him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Memblur works wonders for this.  Used it many times in the exact same situation.<br>
<br>
One of the TaskMasters has a notable AoE.<br>
<br>
&quot;FK did NOT wipe to a Taskmaster with AE&quot;<br>
<br>
Who cares.<br>
<br>
Point is: find mobs that no one contests and you have your FFA - kill it all you want.  If others also want to do em, share.

Don't do it to cockblock, and don't wait all night about it, but just fuckin do it.<br>

That's how we got on Zlandicar rotation back in the day. It's also how we got on Tunare rotation. We started clearing, people respected our intentions, and voila--phat lewtz!<br>
