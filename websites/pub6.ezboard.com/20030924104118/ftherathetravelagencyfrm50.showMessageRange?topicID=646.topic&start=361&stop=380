If you want to consider it a valid comparison then you have to consider comparing Sontalek where Teaming is allowed<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I disagree that teaming would be smiled upon on Sontalek.  Just becuase you don't tell anyone, don't ask anyone, and therefore no one frowns upon it does not make it right.<br>
<br>
Lets use a hypothetical situation:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
BotS gets done raiding early one night and we are bored.  So we do what we normally do.  Look for non Rot boss type mobs to go kill for fun.  As per normal the ones on our regular hit list are not up.  So we decide to res/buff some friends in Seb for something to do.  A full group of us port into EJ and lo and behold Sev is up and someone has trained him to the druid port in.  We defend ourselves and end up killing Sev.  <br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Now since BotS is not currenlty on rotation, but *may* have at one time been we figure hey this is ok since really it is no different than us coming off autopass for one cycle to kill him.  I mean what would be wrong with that? <br>
<br>
If we don't tell anyone, and no one finds out, so no one gets upset about it, that does not make it an alright thing to do.  However even though I think killing RoT mobs that BotS is way beyond now is wrong, it would actually not be in violation of the RTA rules.  By the letter of the law nothing wrong would have been done, however I would argue that the *spirit* of the RTA would be violated.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
There may come a time when these mobs will be on rotation and the application of the rules will be in full swing (and rightfully so). But until such a time, does it really matter if a pick up raid takes AD down on boring sunday afternoon? Will it really affect the guilds who are capable of killing AD? Or would it just mean that 40-70 people will have lots of fun killing a mob that otherwise would not be dead for another couple of days<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So what's the big deal with a group of 5 killing him?  Will it really effect anyone since he will respawn again in a few days?  I mean you are just trying to restrict us from content, and from having fun.  After all we pay our 14.99 a month too.  <br>
<br>
Do you think it is ok for Guilds no longer on rotation to have 1 group teams killing rot mobs once per cycle and re-entering those rots?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Karadin said it in his posts. Others have made it very clear that they dont want teaming... God forbid that a mid sized guild teams up and gets to content that the high end guilds have worked through there time sinks on.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I will just ask what I want to know point blank.  Why will you not make a formal alliance and merge ALL rotations?  Be very specific, why it is you won't do this?  Why do you not want to go all the way and make a formal alliance to help further your progression?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
So far I agree with everything except the spell comment. Minor technicality. Emp drops the highest end spells in the game pre-PoP and AD drops spells you can pick up for 150 plat in the bazaar or off of any tier one named or tier two or three trash mob.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Some spectral spells still sell for 20-30k depending on the spell.  Some will still sell higher even.  With LoY research I see the spells that emp drops coming down slightly in price.  Eventually I think they will even out to about equal value.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Sorry Emil but the Emperor is not a fair comparision to AD, MB, and Grummus. There is NO quest to access Vex Thal without killing the Emperor. Unless it's been the best kept secret on all servers. I can access Drunder by doing a quest or by killing MB. I can only access Vex Thal by killing the Emperor.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This one paragraph got me thinking the most.  Stop and close your eyes for one minute and imagine this scenario.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
Look guild A and B want to team up and kill Emp.  This is total BS that we can't team up and kill Emp.  The RTA put it's blessings on teaming  AD etc... and now won't let 2 guilds team on Emp.  At least with AD you can choose to quest past him instead.  How the hell are we supposed to quest past Emp?  This is just another case of the Ubers trying to keep the smaller guilds down.  I can't believe the hypocrisy of your stance in allowing teaming on a mob you can quest around but not on a mob that you can not quest around.  Emil clearly pointed in another thread how similar these 2 mobs really are and the fact that we are being held back now is total BS.....<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Sure it's a what, who, if, maybe I agree.  The point is NO ONE can predict what the final outcome will be of the RTA opening the pandora's box of blessing guilds to team but not form an alliance.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
 So is that your only reasons? I would really like you to answer the fucking question, which has been asked numerous times, instead of just twisting everybody's posts.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Question - Will the RTA put a formal blessing on guilds being allowed to team on certain boss mob encounters in writing as a formal rule without having to go therough the pain in the ass of forming a formal alliance and losing out on lots of phat loot from the doubled up rotations they both share?<br>
<br>
Answer - NO- The Reason - because the path looks like it drops off a cliff and I am not willing to test it out to see if I am right.  The fact is the path has WAY too many variables, with everyone wanting to go down the path has a different reason and differnt objective.  This opens a while new concept into the whole *spirit* of why we rotate in the first place.  Just because you can't see the *spirit* of why we rotate, or refuse to recognize it does not make it invalid.<br>
<br>

<br>
*edit* I don't pretend to speak for the RTA, I was just answering the question based on how *I* feel about the issue at hand.   I don't hold any power beyond adding my personal thoughts on the matter. <p>Soneya<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Many guilds have expressed an interest in killing sev.<br>
Many guilds have expressed an interest in killing the emperor.<br>
Nobody is restricting you from getting back on the sev rotation.<br>
<br>
Though mobs like Doomshade/Rumblecrush/Sontolak are also sought after, nobody has requested these mobs to be put on rotation.  I can only assume from this fact that that these  mobs  may be fairly engaged by any group/team or combination you can think of.  <br>
<br>
I dont expect the RTA to offer its blessings on teaming up on mobs.  I do expect them to not be involved in situations where the community has not expressed its wish to put the mob on rotation.  Once a request is made, then , in the spirit of sharing, teaming would not be allowed unless a formal alliance is formed. <br>
<br>
[SideNote]   I gather from many of the replies in this thread that it bothers the larger guilds when smaller guilds get together to accomplish a common goal.  Its been mentioned a couple of times that smaller guilds do team up to go into chardok to get there cleric epics.  Does it bother the larger guilds when this happens?  In this case, im not talking about a scenerio where a rotation mob/event is taken but a mob that respawns in two hours.  How about a mob that respawns in 24? Would that bother you?  How about 1 week but no rotation?  How about a spawned mob like the dragon in PoI?  Does teaming in any of these circumstances violate the 'spirit' of the RTA?<br>
<br>
So its a two part question, do these scenerios bother the larger guids and to they violate the spirit of the RTA.<br>
<br>
<br>
If yes to all these questions, then I would see no point in continuing this debate, since its not really an issue of sharing anymore. Its closer to a 'we did it this way, therefore so must you&quot; scenerio or a philosophy on how you think people should progress through the game.   <p>Sprigg Skittlebrow<br>

...and you didn't see the discussions about them either.  They were debated quite a bit and, as a previous poster mentioned, Rublecrush was a hair's width from being on rotation.  A rotation was requested but after discussing it a bit, everyone agreed to an alternate solution.  Sontalak *was* on rotation at one time.<br>

<br>
It depends on the mob.  Epic quest mobs are a non-issue except when Zordrak (or whoever for the cleric epic) was a stupid spawn.  A mob that spawns in 24 hours or less usually require more logistics than can be tolerated (see: Lodizal - rotation on it would mean your guild would have to kill it in a short amount of time when it spawned... during sleep/work hours for instance - not logistically feasible - although some folks did want a rotation on Lodizal at first until they realized what it would require and that it spawned so much that it didn't make sense).  There are mobs that are 1 week without rotation but for the most part, these are for personal quests and such that do not require guild-force to take out.<br>

Just to make it clear, I didn't answer &quot;yes&quot; to all those questions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Teaming is allowed/encouraged by the rules in place under the name &quot;alliance&quot;.  So, either a) you don't know what the word &quot;alliance&quot; means, or b) you want to work around the alliance rules but you still want to accomplish what it takes you an alliance to achieve.

This isn't twisting the rules. Sure, there's no formal rotation on AD, but if you think that because there isn't an update section for it on the RTA that they are not on an agreed upon system between multiple guilds, you're sadly mistaken. <br>
<br>
Stop seeing this as black and white, because it's obviously gray, and *that* is what this is about. <br>
<br>
For those who say &quot;well Rogg changed his mind, why don't you&quot;, please stop. I have the benefit of perhaps another 20 pages worth of text from my position as an admin that relates to this topic, which influenced how I feel. Emil's precedence, that he brought up, was just a finishing component. <br>
<br>
And it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a close precedence. This system obviously does not work on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>exact</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> precedence because there is no such thing as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>exact</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> precedence; the situations would have to be identical, and they arn't. But it is close enough for me, after my readings and following the conversation. <br>
<br>
It won't be enough for everyone. Just because I now see the point, doesn't make the point itself any more or less valid for others. <br>

So we have shades of grey that people are passing off as against the rules?  Where is the line drawn then on this so called grey area of teaming vs Alliance?<br>
Moss snake?<br>
Vindi?<br>
Woushi?<br>
RC?<br>
Royals in chardok?<br>
<br>
I'm really curious?  and Rogg, what points changed your mind suddenly, please enlighten us so that maybe we may see the same light.  And if you now agree that you violated these supposed grey area rules, are you going to be punished for those grey area violations? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=286161" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dembire Deadbones</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
So we have figured out that the High-Tiered guilds don't really care that much about AD, Beh, Grum in and of themselves, but they don't want a precedence set where teams would be able to team up against RZ and others like him.<br>
<br>
BUT, if as quoted here by a High-Tiered guild member, teams will have no realistic chance of killing RZ, then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What the heck are you guys scared of. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This statement invalidates almost your entire reasoning about how teaming would cause problems down the road.  If it took BotS 15 times in their super-Uber gear to kill RZ then how realistic is it that even a full 72 team made up of mid/lower tier guilds are even going to have a remote chance to killing him.  From the above quote - ZERO.<br>
<br>
So if this is true - You will have to think up another excuse as to why the teaming process to kill AD, Behe, Grumm, is inherently going to be trouble besides the fact that you all think &quot;It's just not right to team&quot;.<br>
<br>
And since only Bots (Autopass), Tindi, NB, &amp; FK are the only guilds presently in VT getting all the required Uber gear to have a shot at RZ - Does that mean you are worried about your own non-flagged members teaming up to kill RZ - because it would seem they would be the only people geared enough to have a chance at killing him.<br>
<br>
And by using this reasoning - Any Mid-Tier guild that has the wherewithall (yes that is a word <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) to kill Emperor, camp shards, gain entry to VT, get on the rotation, kill Atan Rah(Sp) and camp Uber VT gear would then have no reason to team against RZ because they would then be geared enough to at least start making shots at RZ as a guild.<br>
<br>
So once again - What are you scared of?  Because it looks like the teaming up on RZ excuse is not really turning out to be a valid one.<br>
<br>

So u don't have to kill mob on your own.<br>
Your bitching about 2 guilds teaming up on him.<br>
Ok then lets say each member  of a single guild invite's a friend of theres along.  These friends are from various different guild's. This is not an alliance this is a guild and friends.  I know of a recent vindi kill when when A guild had help from a few other friends that were in other guilds.  If u don't believe me then just read in the forum they posted thx to the ppl that helped them.<br>
Again these are NOT rotation mobs so they are not required to kill by a guild with no outside help.<br>
<br>
Comparing Non rotation Pop mobs to Rotation Luclin mob is not a valid comparision.  No 1 is asking to team a Rotation mob so quit comparing it to rotation mob.  <br>
As i stated a long time ago.  If 2 guild want to make this a rotation mob then fine do so and accept the responsibility of killing it when it spawns.  If another guild wants a shot they can ask u for it before hand. This is no different then how we do things now.  U complane that blowing a AoW spawn waste loot to the server.  How is a mob sitting up for several day's not wasting loot for the server as well? Though loot is not a main factor in this encounter it is still a part of it.<br>
<br>
I don't care if this mob is put on a rotation as long as the guilds on it are willing to kill it when its up and make it a priority.  If it's not a priority to the guilds that have killed it then let other's go for it however they choose.  <br>
<br>
So again as many have been saying<br>
A. Put it on rotation  and kill it as other rotation denotes.<br>
or<br>
B. Leave it off a rotation and don't bitch when guilds or guild and friends kill it.<br>
<br>
Don't try to overcomplicate the issue like u have heeb for many pages now .<br>

<br>
IT DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER IF IT'S A ROTATION MOB OR NOT.<br>
<br>
All boss mobs on The Rathe, rotational or otherwise, have always been killed by a single entity, a guild or an alliance.  This is how we've maintained one of, if not THE most peaceful massive guild co-exsistances in EverQuest on all the servers.<br>
<br>
And Tammasoul, you tell us to stop trying to complicate the situation? Take a piece of your own advice and stop trying to complicate the system and the way it works on The Rathe.<br>
<br>
Boss mobs, REGARDLESS OF ROTATION, have always been single entity kills to help maintain the peace and order of the server. <p><table align="left">

The only set of rules that has anything to do with FCFS mobs are the play nice rules created by Verant.  Just becuase a few guilds may set up a system amongst themselves does not mean other guilds have to follow the same system.  Just becuase the more progressed guilds have a system set up amongst themselves does not mean that it's an RTA system nor does it mean that other guilds on the RTA have to follow that system.<br>
<br>
It is quite possible that guild A and B have a rotation system on a FCFS mob.  But guild C and D might have a system where C kills the mob on Monday and Tuesday and D kills the mob on Wednesday and Thursday.<br>
<br>
No where does it state in the RTA rules that by becoming a rotation entity that the entity must follow the same system on FCFS mobs that the previous guilds have set up.  When a guild decides to join other guilds that are already on a system, a new system is created.<br>
<br>
Suppose guild A and B have a system set up called AB.  If C wants to participate in killing that mob a new system is created called ABC.  ABC may or may not have the same setup or rules that system AB had.<br>
<br>
How does this apply here?  Just becuase several guilds kill AD as a RTA rotation entity does not mean that other entities have to follow the same system.  The entities that want to participate in killing AD need to come up with a compromise that they all can live with.  &quot;But this is how we've always done it&quot; is not an excuse to not compromise. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zahrimxealdabooboos>Zahrim Xealdabooboos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/18/03 1:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=374>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> Thaldin they read your posts with fingers in ears yelling <br>

---=== THOLUXE PAELLS CALENDAR RULES -- Last Update: 2/17/03 ===---<br>
<br>
<br>
The following are the rules for using the calendar, and what you should expect. Please follow these simple Guidelines:<br>
<br>
- Anything listed below as FCFS CANNOT BE POSTED ON THE CALENDAR OR EVENT PLANNING THREADS UNLESS IT IS A PUBLIC/OPEN RAID. DO NOT POST THESE TYPES OF EVENTS OR THEY WILL GET DELETED.. (OPEN EVENTS MUST SAY THEY ARE OPEN EVENTS IN THE TOPIC TITLE. Failure to do so might result in the deletion of your reservation.)<br>
<br>
<br>
- All reservations in order to be honored must be made 48 hours in advance.<br>
<br>
- One primetime plane raid per month per plane. This does not include Gwan in PoA. PoA non-Gwan raids can be up to 3 days (72 hours). Read below on definition of primetime. &quot;per month per plane&quot; meaning you cannot reserve a PoH raid on Friday, then the weekend later reserve a PoH raid on Saturday (You can go to PoF, PoA, or PoG though). Please note I used the word reserve. If you want to go to PoH and you follow the rules below outlined as a raid &quot;Honored as a plane&quot;, you can still by these rules, go to the same plane multiple times on primetime days on the month. That depends on what reservations have already been made.<br>
<br>
- To make your reservation PROPER, you must post your event on the tholuxe.com calendar, as well as make a thread in the event planning thread for the approporate month. In the event of a dispute if two reservations were done improperly, then the event posted in the event planning thread will take precidence.<br>
<br>
- If you break these rules, there is no punishment. These rules are made in an attempt to be as civil as possible to give everyone a fair raiding experence. If a dispute breaks out over reservations, we all ask to please be calm, relaxed, and work things out together.<br>
<br>
---=== DEFINITIONS ===---<br>
<br>
<br>
Reserve: This can be put in the tholuxe.com calendar and event planning thread. This is something that has been agreed upon by the guilds that wish to follow and use the calendar.<br>
<br>
FCFS: First come first serve. Meaning -- This may NOT BE SCHEDULED ON THE CALENDAR. Whomever is there first gets it and should not be interfered UNLESS something is agreed upon by those already there. Being there &quot;first&quot; means the following (or combination of where that applies):<br>
<br>
. Being at recognized &quot;camp spot&quot; in areas like Kael Arena or Halls of Testing.<br>
. Being in recognized &quot;zone&quot; as in Kedge relating to Phinny, EJ relating to Servelious, etc.<br>
. Being first to engage a mob AND having sufficient force AT THE MOB to KILL THE MOB. If you have a bard kiting Lodizal, you do not have him by FCFS. If you have a bard kiting Lodizal with 20 guildies zoning in and 20 of another guild is just arriving at Lodi, the guildies that are zoning in do not get lodi.<br>
<br>
Honored as a plane: If you are not the guild that has reserved this plane, you may not enter this plane for ANY REASON if it is less than the re-pop time of the common planar mobs of the reserved guilds schedule start time. If a particular mob inside the plane is needed, you need to contact the guild that had it reserved if you want the mob. Reservation for these zones absolutely must be done at least 4 days in advance. Failure to do so makes your raid time meaningless and does not have to be honored.<br>
<br>
Honored as an epic raid: If you are not the guild that has reserved a specific set of mobs designed solely as an epic raid you may not be engaging said mobs before those mobs repop. i.e. Chardok royals at 3:00pm meaning you cannot be killing the royals at 2:00pm. You need to be finished by 1:00pm.<br>
<br>
Honored as a dragon raid: No one may schedule a dragon raid less than 7 days from someones previous dragon raid reservation UNLESS a patch occurs. No guild, nor alliance may reserve Naggy or Vox more than once in the same month (1 naggy and 1 vox is fine) as a closed raid. They may do this if they are hosting an OPEN RAID. If Naggy and/or Vox is up after patch, the guild that scheduled the naggy/vox raid MUST kill their dragon within 1 day (24 hours), or that particular Naggy or Vox becomes FCFS.<br>
<br>
Speciality Ubermobs or &quot;Misc. Ubermobs&quot;: Innoruuk, Vindi, etc etc (You get the picture here). I would consider an Ubermob any special loot mob that hits for more than 500dmg with exception to epic mobs (i.e. Ixiblat)<br>
<br>
Primetime Day: Friday, Saturday, Sunday in YOUR TIMEZONE.<br>
<br>
---=== LIST OF ZONES/MOBS AND THEIR RESERVEABLE STATUS AND CONDITIONS ===---<br>
<br>
<br>
Plane of Growth: Reserveable and should be honored as a plane including all epic related mobs, and speciality ubermobs. Only one primetime day reservation per month.<br>
Plane of Hate: Reserveable and should be honored as a plane including all epic related mobs, and speciality ubermobs. Only one primetime day reservation per month.<br>
Plane of Fear: Reserveable and should be honored as a plane including all epic related mobs, and speciality ubermobs. Only one primetime day reservation per month.<br>
Plane of Air: Reserveable and should be honored as a plane and honored as an epic raid including all epic related mobs, and speciality ubermobs WITH EXCEPTION TO GWAN. Gwan is FCFS provided the island one is not clear earlier than 8 hours from another PoA raid AND there is no other guild in PoA. Up to 3 days may be reserved for PoA in a row.<br>
Kael Arena: FCFS -- KAEL ARENA IS ONE CAMP however if FIRST group there chooses to split the arena into left/right camps, it is THEIR option to do so. Mansion is also ONE CAMP and FCFS.<br>
City of Mist: Reavers are FCFS. If a rak'ashiir kill is needed for a shaman, there is no reason the existing raid wont let you (that I know) kill Rak'Ashiir unless their shaman needs an epic piece. Neh'Ashiir is a part of whomever is there first. If a guild is already killing reavers, you may not go past them and kill the remaining reavers.<br>
Kedge Keep: FCFS - If a guild/group is in Kedge but NOT killing Phinny and phinny is up, phinny may be killed by another guild, but ONLY if the group there first does not want phinny.<br>
Venril Sathir and VS Remains: FCFS -- 15 Minutes MAX allowed from the time of claiming VS/VSR from KC Zone in (via /tell, shout, or ooc) to the time they are clearing to him. If someone wants to allow more time, thats fine, but only 15 minutes should be obligated.<br>

BUT, if as quoted here by a High-Tiered guild member, teams will have no realistic chance of killing RZ, then What the heck are you guys scared of. This statement invalidates almost your entire reasoning about how teaming would cause problems down the road. If it took BotS 15 times in their super-Uber gear to kill RZ then how realistic is it that even a full 72 team made up of mid/lower tier guilds are even going to have a remote chance to killing him.

The problem you have is that you assume the teaming guilds would stop at 72 people.  A guild can not kill AD with its 40 members, so it works with another guild to kill AD.  If those 72 people now were unable to kill RZ, why would they not do the same exact thing, bringing more people to help them kill RZ?<br>
<br>
I'm sure giving enough tries 200 people from mid-tier guilds could kill RZ eventually. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gradukk>Gradukk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tindi Losi - GL</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/18/03 1:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=376>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://monkey.thirty4.com/images/eq/tindi/975.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> Just because he said half SoY and Half TMS would not be able to take on RZ, does not mean that LoM + VoF could not do it. Therefore the arguement is not invalidated.<br>
<br>
I also agree with Karadin that standing at the threshold of RZtW is very very tempting. Have you looked at the Elemental Armor stats lately? Have you seen the items that drop in the Elemental planes? If so, then you can see the temptation for a 'one time' teaming of the Warlord.<br>
<br>
I see people arguing that if they were going to break the rules, they would do it before then...how is this the case? Anyone with an IQ over 70 would realize that keeping 2 sets of rotations going as long as they could, would be beneficial to them.<br>
<br>
So they creep their way up into the posistion of being one mob away from the elementals. Do they work on Rallos for 3 months to get the solo kill or do they Team 1 time on Rallos, get in months ahead of when they would have, and enjoy the fruits of the Elemental planes now? The lure of the Elemental loot gets much stronger with each progression mob you take down.<br>
<br>
When Tindi first killed Terris Thule back in November or whatever, elemental planes were just a rumor. By the time we were ready for Mith Marr and Bertoxx however, we knew what was waiting up there to be had. Each flag mob we killed reminded us that we were one step closer to ele's. By the time we got to Rallos, there was nothing anyone could do to stop us from getting him dead. We spent roughly 2 solid weeks in Tactics ignoring all else until we had him down.<br>
<br>
This is the lure of the Elemental planes and how strong it is. Would my guild have spent all that time working on Rallos if he just led to another 'xp' zone, with minimal loots? No. Sure we would have fought him once in a while, till we got it down, but once you are that close to the 'best loots in the game', you become very focused in order to break the final barrier.<br>
<br>
This is where the whole RZtW arguement comes from. If we let AD, Behe, Grummus slide, what comes next? People ally on Bertox one night? Hell it might even go unnoticed since Bert stays up for weeks at a time. Mith Marr? He is probably up right now as I type this, hmm I guess he is non contested as well, and he alone doesn't even grant access to another zone! Even more reasons people should be able to team up for him... Where do you draw the line seems to be what this all boils down to. Do you wait till people are at the gates of RZtW wanting 'equal access' to the Elemental planes, when they have double dipped all the way to him? Or do you try to stop it by keeping all boss/flag encounters/rotations on the same playing field, where all the rules are already defined and agreed upon?<br>
<br>
Some say its paranoid to view things like this, personally it just seems like common sense to me. We have seen people break rotation on this mob or that mob before in the RTA. So if you are going to break rotation one time ever, might as well be on RZtW, seeing as once its done, it is irreversable, you are in the Elemental planes... However if we force people to get to Rallos Zek by going it solo from day one, or allied from day one, then they take the detrimental effects of moving up, along with the benefits. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tammasoul>Tammasoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Inc %T on my arse!<BR>

&quot;All boss mobs on The Rathe, rotational or otherwise, have always been killed by a single entity, a guild or an alliance. This is how we've maintained one of, if not THE most peaceful massive guild co-exsistances in EverQuest on all the servers&quot;<br>

What are these non rotation boss mobs u speak of i'd like some clarification on this? <p>Tammasoul<br>

<br>
The same could be said of the rotation system in its entirety(sp).  Just because the more progressed guilds have a system set up amongst themselves to share the killing of specific mobs in a rotational order does not mean that other guils on the RTA have to follow that system.<br>
<br>
But yet the rotation system does work, and most of the guilds on the server work within this system.  So why does it work?  Because everyone knows that by respecting another guilds rotations, thier own rotations will be respected.  NB knows that because they respect the rotations that BotS is on, BotS will then respect our rotations.<br>

<br>
I do understand the thought process about the abuse of continual teaming to speed through PoP.  I also understand that those guilds that have done it by themselves will frown upon those that find it necessary to team up to kill these mobs.  Though I do find it a tad funny that you all think that really has some type of effect on us.  I play EQ for guild and individual advancement (and fun - can't forget that).  I don't play to make the Uber guilds happy and content.<br>
<br>
I just think it is almost improbable to think that teams will be able to pull it off, even if they want to.<br>
<br>
Teaming between guilds is HARD.  What members from guilds get to join the flagging team?  What members are left off?  Will those guild members left off ever now get a chance to be flagged?  Who gets the dropped loot?  Who decided who gets that loot?<br>
<br>
With all these questions add the difficulty of just the logistics of fighting a boss mob using the teaming process.  <br>
<br>
These issues will cause massive strife within any guild attempting to use the teaming process.<br>
<br>
I just don't think it will happen.  You have just stated how it took Tindi 2 full weeks in Tactics of IGNORING EVERYTHING ELSE to take down RZ.  It took BotS 15+ trys.<br>
<br>
After all this, you really think a patchwork mid-tier team could come in and take him down in one shot?  Or do you think that team would be able to stay together for two straight weeks or after 15+ tries?<br>
<br>
I think you are all trying to put the cart before the horse in this analogy.  So far we have had one team take down AD (and once again - A big congrats from me on that) and you  all are acting like it is a common practice or that it will absolutely be a precursor to it becoming a common practice.<br>
<br>
Like all of a sudden Mid-tier guilds are just going to stop all their guild progress so that they can start working on teaming, just so that a few members can get flagged to another higher zone.  That's ridiculous.  Those guilds would go under in a heartbeat.  There would be so much guild mutiny it would be incredible.<br>

Gotcha..Understand that reasoning perfectly.<br>
<br>
But C'mon - You are talking about a 200 player team across three-four guilds.  You are talking about something that has never even been considered or attempted, especially at this type of difficulty level.  Something that would bring chaos and anger within any of these guilds attempting this.<br>
<br>
To me, this is about as probable as all the guilds outside the big three/four joining to make one huge guild consisting of 3500 people.  It's just not going to happen.<br>
<br>
I think you are taking the absolute most improbable thing to ever happen on our server and just because people think that there might be a 1% chance of it happening - Let's make a rule to make sure it doesn't.<br>
