<br>
As the shuttle breezed into Faydwer Docks, Falkieri Calimachil, breathed the fresh air of the lands of his birth.<br>
<br>
As a member of the elite order of the Koada'Vie he had been exploring the newly re-discovered lands of Kunark. From the rebuilt outpost of Fironia Vie many members of the Koada'Dal had been branching out in an effort to subdue the newly discovered evil in that place.<br>
<br>
&quot;It will be a task to consume many centuries,&quot; said Falkieri as he left the shuttle and moved lithly onto the docks.<br>
<br>
&quot;And yet the evil is still not expunged in our homelands.&quot; observed the Cleric Ghuagim, his travelling companion.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you refer to priest?&quot; asked the Paladin Falkieri.<br>
<br>
&quot;Crushbone&quot;.<br>
<br>
Falkieri's eyes narrowed as he remmebered the pain of his youth. Crushbone - a stronghold abutting the great forest of Greater Faydark. A stronghold of the evil Crushbone Orcs. War between the Feir'Dal and the orcs had continued unabatted for many years.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Crushbone,&quot; continued Ghuagim,&quot;and I have heard that Ambassador D'vinn has returned.&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly the old memeories threatened to overwhelm Falkieri. Memories of an raid on Crushbone to claim the life of the Orc Prophet in his youth. A raid that would weaken the mystic powers of the Crushbone Oracles. A raid that had only one survivor - Falkieri.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dvinn is back is he?&quot; said Falkieri. It was not really a question.<br>
<br>
As Falkieri and Ghuagim reached the gates of Kaladim they parted. Ghaugim was carrying messages to the Clerics of Brell.<br>
<br>
Dvinn. The legendary assassin of Neriak. That raid would have been successful if not for him. A dangerous opponent. Many of his friends had died that day. Falkieri had only survived due to the blessings of Tunare.<br>
<br>
Falkieri's eyes burnt with righteous rage. It was time.<br>
<br>
Without a word of parting Falkieri strode away from Ghaugim and the gates of Kaladim and turned his thoughts to Greater Faydark. There he would go straight to Crushbone and strike a blow for Felwithe.<br>
<br>
=========================================================<br>
<br>
Part 2:  To the Tower<br>
<br>
It was still dark when the lone Paladin approached the enterance of the Orc citadel.<br>
<br>
For a adventurer of Falkieri's experience it was no task to slip into Crushbone un-noticed. Such was Falkieri's power and reputation that no Orc Centurion or Legionaire would have sought to stop him anyway. For an Orc, even life can be valued - his own.<br>
<br>
As he slipped around Trainer Hill, Falkieri gazed upon the castle. Around its base many bodies of elves, dwarfs and gnomes were rotting - victims of misguided attempts to put to an end this montrosity. No doubt his friends bones were rotting there as well.<br>
<br>
All was dark. No light or movement came from the castle except the tower. Yes the tower. That must be where Dvinn would be. Either alone or with escorts, that would be where Dvinn was.<br>
<br>
Silently Falkieri strode into the castle. None would gainsay his way. He strode through the throne room and came to the tower stairs. There stood a royal guard. Without warning Falkieri cut him down, and proceeded up the stairs.<br>
<br>
As he rounded the bend he had a clear view into the Tower. There talking quietly were two of the most vile creatures in all of Crushbone - Dvinn and Emperor Crush.<br>
<br>
Of the two Dvinn was the most dangerous. So quickly Falkieri called upon magical roots to hold Dvinn in place. As the Teir'Dal cried out in surprise and rage the monstrous orc called Crush turned on the Paladin.<br>
<br>
Out came Falkieri's sword as it met Crush's blade. Within seconds Falkieri knew that Crush was no match for him. For although the orc put on a good fight, he could not match Falkieri's skills and prowress. The Emperor was soon dead there was little time to relax.<br>
<br>
The fight with Crush, while quick, had still seen wounds be landed on Falkieri. But there was time to rest as Dvinn broke the magical roots holding him in place and attacked Dvinn with fury.<br>
<br>
The Paladin and Dark Elf were evenly matched. Falkieri's skill at dodging and superior armor was evened by Dvinn's furious attacks. But it was not an equal fight because Dvinn was fresh, where Falkieri was tired.<br>
<br>
The battle spilled out into the throne room where horrified orcs slunk into the walls. So great was their fear of Dvinn and the Paladin that had slain their lord that they did not intervene.<br>
<br>
Falkieri, although disadvantaged, did not despair. Tunare would watch over him.<br>
<br>
===========================================================<br>
<br>
Part 3: The Judgement of Tunare<br>
<br>
Tunare would watch over him.... or would she?<br>
<br>
What were Falkieri's motives in this assult? Graeter glory of the Koada'Dal and the Light... or revenge?<br>
<br>
Tunare, or so the Paladins of Tunare were taught, treasurered her Paladin's. But she would only offer her holy healing if the Paladin was deserving.<br>
<br>
Falkieri has slipped into a trap of his own making. His arrogance that Tunare would support his every move was mistaken. Also if he had stopped and contemplated his actions he would have discovered that they were solely driven by revenge. Suitable conduct for a ShadowKnight, but not a Paladin.<br>
<br>
Dvinn was winning the battle as Falkieri fealt his life force fade. More and more Dvinn's blows drew blood. In desperation Falkieri called upon Tunare for her holy blessing.<br>
<br>
But it did not come.<br>
<br>
In shock Falkieri lowered his sword and was rewarded with a blow from Dvinn that knocked the Paladin out a window and sprawling onto the ground outside the castle.<br>
<br>
This battle was lost - Falkieri knew that his only hope for survival laid in fleeing.<br>
<br>
With a mightly jump he cleared the moat surrounding the castle and raced towards the enterance. On his toes was Dvinn and a group of Orc Legionaires.<br>
<br>
As he entered the cave that led to the safety of the forest he fealt a killing blow. Dvinn had backstabbed him, laying a death blow.<br>
<br>
As his strength failed, he saw Dvinn tower over him, snarling. &quot;You are no match for the Indigo Brotherhood.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tunare forgive me,&quot; mumbled the Paladin as his life faded.<br>
<br>
And in the shades of Castle Crushbone the light lost a Paladin of Tunare - killed by his thirst for revenge against his enemies, not Tunare's.<br>
<br>
/ooc This is a true story. I decided to go and kill Dvinn for revenge last night. I went to the castle and attacked Dvinn and Crush. Crush is now green to me so I deispatched him quickly with about 1/2 my hp left. Thinking I had LOH available I proceeded to attack Dvinn. When My hp were down to 1/3 I decided to LOH, but found to my horror that I had used it only half an hour before.<br>
<br>
So I ran and was killed at the cavern near the CB enterance.<br>
<br>
I thought I might create a story out of it for your reading pleasure.... maybe  <br>
