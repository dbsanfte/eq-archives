Rogg, I have always held the utmost respect for you, but that low-blow on Trolo really made me lose some.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
/shrug Truth hurts a little eh? I know he's your brother, and that's nice that you stick up for him. Really, I mean it. <br>
<br>
Pick the battles tho eh?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
So basically what you are saying is, now let me get this straight...<br>
<br>
That what CoN says is absolutely true, because they have logs, yet when someone comes here, who is not on either side and tells their story, its false and bullshit?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Who came here that wasn't on SoY's side? It's nice that Trolo feels he should defend his brothers guild, and I respect the brothers keeper routine you are doing too, but there are TWO possible theories here. <br>
<br>
1. The logs are false, and Trolo is telling the truth, along with all the Yama's. <br>
<br>
2. The logs are real, and trolo is either lying or misinformed (though I suspect at least a little willfully misinformed.<br>
<br>
The two are mutually exclusive: <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
I am not saying they are fake or edited, but how can you call him a liar?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'll admit, Trolo could be just grossly misinformed, maybe by word of mouth, or what he wants to believe, or whatever. He could be telling what he thinks the truth is. He's wrong, but that's neither here nor there. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Fuck that. How can you say my brother is lying and those logs are absolute truth? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Because Turean, and wrap your head around this for a second: there is no middle ground. Again, I've ceded that Trolo could just be wrong. Fine. He's just wrong. Tell him so, and that will do nicely. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
I have lived with him and known him a fucking lot longer than you, obviously, and one thing he is not, is a liar or underhanded.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's funny, I'd call shooting tells at anyone and everyone he could find online, and trying to convince them that somehow Aesclepius and Alinor are the devil and horrible people, before guild removing, without discussing any issues he may have had in his mind with them in any way, that sounds pretty underhanded to me, and is part of the reason that I would be just as happy to hear that his online persona got hit by a truck. If you don't know his underhanded side, maybe you should rethink your candy coated view of little brother. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
so what is to say he is lying when he did not see any camp calls in /ooc? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, lets assume that his attention rate was 100% as you suggest it's easy to accomplish. <br>
<br>
He missed the camp checks. They're in the logs that you, your own self, have said you don't believe to be falsified. <br>
<br>
INCONGRUITY!!! WARNING WARNING WARNING. <br>
<br>
If he's honestly just wrong, then I apologize for calling him a liar, he's just ignorant to the situation. My bad, I'll make sure to be aware of the differance when dealing with this subject in the future. <br>
<br>
So yeah, at a 100% attention rate, if he says he missed all the camp checks, he lies. If he, you know, *didn't* pay 100% attention, made a sandwitch, talked on the phone, watched a little TV... than he can't come here and say &quot;Oh, there were no camp checks, stop the hate&quot;. <br>
<br>
And no, it is not *just* the logs, reapeated from *both sides* now. It's not *just* that I've dealt with Kenshiiro in the past, and find him to be every bit as conniving now as I did then, except now he's on a larger scale. It's not *just* any one single thing that says, to me, yeah, CoN have this right, and SoY are doing damage control and spinning this to the best of their ability. It's every impression I've had about Yama Clan/SoY since the moment I noticed their numbers growing on the Rathe. <br>
<br>
From the day I saw your brother tagged with them, I had to laugh to myself. (Binamar I mean). Binamar, the same guy that cracked off on Zephyrr in guildchat about absolutely nothing at all.  (which to those of you who don't know her, is the verbal equivilent of hitting a rabbit with a baseball bat, she was never anything but motherly and caring to the members of the guild while she was in it- disagreements at the officer level, sure, but nothing but helpful to the members). <br>
<br>
It was funny to watch the ranks of the Yammabushi Clan grow and swell with people who I remember being trouble makers and selfish brats as I levelled up. When it was a guild of level 40's who played with themselves, no one cared. Under the radar is the term. <br>
<br>
Sure, no problem, guild disbands, reforms as SoY. We all roll our eyes, and think, ok, well, whatever. <br>
<br>
Then, you know, we see them on rotations, killin mobs, well, alright, sure, change our minds slowly, alright. Hell, Alinor the other day in our officers channel said that SoY had come a long way, really progressed in a way that she didn't think was possible from the beginnings that the guild had. We all grudgingly agreed and went on with life. <br>
<br>
Then, heaven opens up and restores the faith I have in the lowest common denominator. <br>
<br>
Yeah, I'd safe to say that the reputation follows the people, and the people follow the reputation. <br>
<br>
And really, frankly, I don't care how they play, or talk, or act, as long as it doesn't infringe on the other people on the server, as it has this time. If they wanna go play in the sandbox, and can manage to play nice with everyone, they could be taking flying leaps off the top of the Avatar of war for all I care, or farming Vex Thal. <br>
<br>
But they don't play nice, as evidenced by this, and not only are not visibly sorry about it, have people that come to their defense and say &quot;oh, gee, what's a gentlemans agreement? we're on Sullon Zek, right?&quot;, in almost as few words. <br>
<br>
You want to know the last time I said anything remotely close to &quot;yeah, let them wipe, we'll kill the mob after this&quot; was? <br>
<br>
Oh, about a quarter past NEVER. <br>
<br>
Now, for the crux of this post:<br>
<br>
Some of you may be wondering why, exactly, I'm so vehement about this?<br>
<br>
Well, I can think one of two things. <br>
<br>
1. SoY will implode or explode and scatter their people all around the game.<br>
<br>
2. SoY will continue to play their own special way, and grow at whatever pace they grow at, into new mobs and new things. <br>
<br>
If 1 is the option, no skin off my nose.<br>
<br>
If number 2, however, is the option, they are damn well going to learn that there are other people on this server, and we don't operate on a 'take take take, oh... and take' basis. <br>
<br>
If they don't learn that, then someday it won't be CoN who get rolled over, it will be *my guild*. Like I said, I don't care if they raid on pogo sticks with clerics tanking and warriors in a bind wound rotation. So long as their fun doesn't ruin it for someone else in such an obvious way. <br>
<br>
In CoN's shoes, there but for the grace of god go I, and all my guildmates. <br>
<br>
We, as people and players, should not have to put up with that crap. <br>
<br>
Ignoring conventions is easy to start, and probably difficult to stop for some. That's a slippery slope that no one wants to get on. <br>
<br>
But eh, why bother, this post will fall to deaf ears. It's obvious that SoY actually feel that if they are not right, that they are at least 'not wrong'. <br>
