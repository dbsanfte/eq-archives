Yyyowwwwww!” The cry echoed throughout the valley. <br>
<br>
Watchmen Prynn and Prenn watched (that’s what Watchmen do, after all: watch) the two-legged ball of fire that was now streaking along the path in front of Ak’Anon. As the fireball came closer to the Watchmen they could see what appeared to be two arms flailing and thrashing in the air above the flames. The screaming continued. The ball of flame came closer and closer to the gates of the city and now the Watchmen could discern a small humanoid shape in the heart of the fire. They could also start to make out what the little ball of fire was screaming. Perfectly good words like “HOT!” and “FIRE!” were intermingled with other sounds such as “OWW!” and “YIE-YIE-YIE!”. <br>
<br>
Watchman Prynn turned to his partner and said, “If it comes any closer we’re going to have to deal with this, you know.” <br>
<br>
Prenn sighed and nodded.<br>
<br>
The fireball continued on its course directly towards the two Watchmen. Closer and closer it came until, just before it would have crashed directly into Watchman Prynn, the Watchmen held out their shields and ordered “Halt!” It should be noted that neither Watchman Prynn nor Prenn flinched or moved away from the little ball of fire - both Watchmen were, after all, Gemchoppers and, as such, took their duty to guard the gates of Ak’Anon very seriously.<br>
<br>
The ball of fire suddenly veered to the left and started to run in a circle in front of the Watchmen. Prenn reflected for a moment that it seemed odd that a ball of fire would “run” anywhere, let alone in a circle, but since this particular ball of fire DID have two legs “run” seemed like a perfectly good way to explain what this ball of fire was doing, even if its use couldn’t be expanded to describe all balls of fire.<br>
<br>
“GET IT OFF ME! GET IT OFF ME!” screeched the fireball as it circled in front of the Watchmen. As if to accompany the words the fireball’s arms (yes, this fireball did indeed have arms - which would probably seem more odd if it weren’t for the fact that it also had legs) waved, flailed and gesticulated madly in the air above the flames and seemed to say on their own, with no help from any mouth, “GET IT OFF ME! GET IT OFF ME!” <br>
<br>
Prynn and Prenn exchanged a confused glance as they pondered exactly what it was this fireball wished to have them remove and, moreover, whether it would be within the scope of their duty to remove whatever it may have been that this fireball was referring to. After a moment’s consideration, Prenn looked at Prynn and coughed. Prynn, having shared this duty station with Prenn for years, knew that Prenn’s cough meant both that Prenn felt that they should intercede on this fireball’s behalf and that Prenn was going to leave the matter completely up to Prynn to resolve.<br>
<br>
Prynn took a deep breath and let it out slowly. <br>
<br>
“GET IT OFF ME! HOT HOT HOT! GET IT OFF ME!”<br>
<br>
“Excuse me, Mr... ummm, Mr. Fireball, but what exactly is it that you need ‘off’?” asked Prynn.<br>
<br>
“THE CLOAK! YOWWWWIE! THE CLOAK! GET IT OFF ME!”<br>
<br>
Now THIS statement confused Watchman Prynn. While a fireball with legs and arms was, admittedly, ODD, it was not exactly PECULIAR. After all, Prynn understood perfectly well just how convenient it was to have legs and arms and could therefore understand why a fireball would want them. But a ball of fire with a cloak was, indeed, PECULIAR. More than PECULIAR, a fireball with a cloak was decidedly STRANGE. What use could a ball of fire have for a cloak, after all? A fireball certainly wouldn’t need a cloak to keep itself warm. Prynn looked to his partner Prenn for help with this question, but Prenn’s raised eyebrow told Prynn more eloquently than any words that Prenn was equally astounded by the idea of a fireball with a cloak. <br>
<br>
“GET IT OFF ME! GET IT OFF ME!”<br>
<br>
Prynn continued to ponder why a fireball would need a cloak. He focused his entire mind on the problem at hand, but a peal of thunder in the distance brought his attention to the clouds which now hung, gray and threatening, above the Steamfonts. This seemed to spur Prynn’s mind into an extra gear and he was suddenly struck with a revelation.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps,” Prynn said to Prenn, “perhaps it has a cloak to keep the rain off it.”<br>
<br>
Prenn’s eyebrows scrunched together as he considered that possibility, then he looked at Prynn and shrugged slightly - a motion which Prynn knew to mean that Prenn could think of no reason to disagree with Prynn on that issue.<br>
<br>
Satisfied now as to why a fireball would need a cloak, Prynn turned his attention back to the fireball. <br>
<br>
“OUCH! FIRE! HOT! GET IT OFF ME!”<br>
<br>
“Actually, Mr. Fireball, I don’t think I can help you with that. It looks like it’s going to rain soon, so if I take your cloak off you’d be in danger of being extinguished.”<br>
<br>
“YES YES YES! EXTINGUISH! PUT IT OUT! FIRE HOT!”<br>
<br>
“Put it out? But wouldn’t that kill you if the fire was put out? I don’t know much about fireballs myself, but my Great Uncle Xavatompalus always used to yell at me when I poured water on the fire in his laboratory. ‘Prynn,’ he’d say, ‘If you put my fire out I’ll tan your hide! And don’t think I can’t do it!’ Or was it my Uncle Tabalipik who said that? Hmmm.... Well, either way, it seems to me that if I take your cloak off, then the rain might fall and put you out, and then I’d get my hide tanned. So, you see, I don’t think it’d be right to take the cloak off of a fireball.”<br>
<br>
Prenn nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
The fireball, which had been in constant motion and screaming since the two Watchmen had first noticed it running down the path, suddenly stopped and became deathly quiet. “Excuse me,” said the fireball, “But did I hear you properly? Did you just refer to me as a ‘fireball’?”<br>
<br>
“Well, it seemed proper to do so, seeing as how you are a great big ball of fire. No offense was intended. If you prefer a different form of address, such as ‘Flameball’ or ‘Ball of Flame’, just let me know and from now on I would be only too happy to refer to you as such.” Replied Prynn.<br>
<br>
The fireball sighed once, if a fireball can be said to sigh, then it took a deep breath before it started to once again flail its arms above its head and run in a circle while it positively screeched, “I AM NOT A FIREBALL! IT’S ME, GLYMMARACH! GET IT OFF ME! HOT HOT HOT! GET IT OFF ME!”<br>
<br>
The wheels in Prynn’s mind were whirring at full speed now. Something here just wasn’t right. Suddenly, he had it! “Glymmarach, I’m not sure if you’re aware of this or not, but... ummm, well... you seem to be on fire.”<br>
<br>
“YOU DON’T THINK I KNOW THAT!?!?! HOT HOT HOT! PUT IT OUT!” <br>
<br>
Glymmarach threw himself down to the ground and began rolling around furiously. While this did not quench the flames that were enveloping him, it did have the effect of starting the grass in front of the city gates on fire.<br>
<br>
Prynn and Prenn noted that the fire had spread to the grounds in front of the city, and their duty was now clear. Prenn looked at Prynn and nodded, a gesture which Prynn knew to mean “I’ll handle this.”<br>
<br>
Prenn turned and pulled a rope that hung from the city entrance. From somewhere within the city a siren sounded for a moment then, with a loud crash, went silent. <br>
<br>
Suddenly the air was filled with the sound of footsteps as a dozen (a baker’s dozen, that is) gnomes burst forth from the city. Each was dressed in a bulky, metallic suit and wore a helmet with a flashing red light on top and wore a large badge that said “Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade”. One of them, whose badge was even larger and said “Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade, Fire Extinguishing Brigade Chief” and was apparently in charge of the brigade, approached Prenn, “What seems to be the problem, Watchman?” he asked.<br>
<br>
Prenn pointed at the fire that covered Glymmarach and the small patch of grass in front of the city.<br>
<br>
“A fire! A real fire!” Exclaimed the Royal Ak’Ananon Fire Extinguishing Brigade Chief. “Royal Ak'Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade, prepare to extinguish fire!”<br>
<br>
At his command, the Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade disappeared back into the city, leaving Prynn and Prenn alone with the burning Glymmarach - who, truth be told, wasn’t very good company at all as he seemed unable to do anything except scream “HOT HOT HOT! PUT IT OUT” as he thrashed about on the ground.<br>
<br>
Eventually Glymmarach’s cries were drowned out by a terrible screeching sound which slowly grew louder and louder. The source of the sound became obvious when the Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade returned. They rode on the top of a large contraption made of iron pipes surrounding a large tank with a long lever atop it. The whole device rode on six large wheels. A series of gears ran from each wheel to a large crank that was mounted on the top of the frame. The cranks were manned by the dozen members of the Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade (a regular dozen, not a baker’s dozen) who sweated profusely as they turned the cranks. The Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade Chief (who wasn’t turning a crank, hence the confusion over what kind of dozen was turning the cranks) shouted out orders such as “All wheels 7 cranks forward” and “Left wheels 4 cranks forward, right wheels 5 cranks back” until finally, after several minutes of maneuvering, the machine was positioned alongside the burning grass and Glymmarach.<br>
<br>
The Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade Chief surveyed the situation and commanded, “Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade, prepare the hose!” The dozen members of the Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade leapt to action. Four of them manned the lever atop the tank, while eight attached a hose to the large tank. The eight gnomes took a firm hold of the hose as the other four gnomes began to push and pull on the lever atop the tank. The hose began to expand - yet nothing came forth from it.<br>
<br>
“Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade, EXTINGUISH FIRE!”<br>
<br>
The gnome at the front of the hose opened a valve. The gnomes valiantly clung to the hose as a small trickle of water issued forth from it. Slowly they worked the hose back and forth over the fire until all that was left was a blackened patch of grass and a thoroughly miserable and wet Glymmarach.<br>
<br>
Glymmarach clambered to his feet, thanked the Royal Ak’Anon Fire Extinguishing Brigade, and started to trudge back towards the Windmills. As he walked off, Prynn and Prenn overheard him muttering to himself about reducing the amount of Firewater to use in his next attempt at making a Thermal Cloak. </font><p><b><font face="Arial" size="3">Glymmarach Gizzervizzinius<br>
