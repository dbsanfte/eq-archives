 Your still pathetic in your attempts... Levlenna asked for Vryu to defend himself now she can take her own advise and do the same. Nice person? Yeah, I thought the same, but to accuse my own WIFE of destroying my gear is pretty dam low as low as recruiting high end toons with second hand owners. Whether Vryu plays the druid or Blaal on the raids doesn't matter fact is they are both E-bayed. <br>

Not like DROW needs anyone to like us hate us or defend us. <br>
My fight is with one spiteful fruitcake whom VoF has chosen to side with and I will keep defending myself as long as I need too.<br>

has any BoTS members been attacked in VoF guild = yes<br>
has any BoTS members been talked good of in VoF guild = yes<br>
has any SoT members been attacked in VoF guild = yes<br>
has any SoT members been talked good of in VoF guild = yes<br>
has any NB members been attacked in VoF guild = yes<br>
has any NB members been talked good of in VoF guild = yes<br>

has any TL members been talked good of in VoF guild = yes<br>
has any random guild members been attacked in VoF guild = yes<br>
has any random guild members been talked good of in VoF guild = yes<br>
have I defend anyone (form any of the named guilds) yes I have.<br>
have I attacked anyone (form any of the named guilds) yes I have.<br>
My point is I/we dont dislike any guilds only some guild members<br>
hell we (VoF) even want it to help BoTS clear PoG (and still would) so they could try tunare<br>
so please dont go there.<br>
I beviled some of the thinks you said at the start of all this (I still do to some point). But when you keeped seeing and telling every thing in black and weight we stopped up and thought is he telling the whole through. When Vryu did the same thing. I stopped believe you bough. But you kept painting in black and wight and attacking Vryu. You did not even stop up and give all the grays shades a change to get out. <br>
And we and started to think that it was because you where not telling the whole truogh. And after that you started to attack VoF in genial. I dont think we ever gonna know the trough but that is you’re own fault. And it is also you’re own fault noone believes you anymore.<br>
To tell you the trough I think it is a damn shame cuz you used to be a nice guy. But I have no sympathy whit you anymore and that is you’re own fault.<br>
Just let it rest and take a break man I think it is best for you. Remember it is only a game and that should not be some thing you loose friends over. Keep it in mind and stay cool.<br>
I really hope you get you’re stuff abit more together. Cuz it is a shame to see an old friend like you just turn 180 degrees like you have.<br>

<br>
 Your points are viable and my point has been made long ago like Solt said in his own whatever ya wanna call it. I still refuse to befriend Mr. Ebay again only for the sole reason of what I know he did. Either way whats done is done and I defended myself as I should have. I don't plan to post anymore on this crap either as long as no more stories get conjured up again.<br>

<br>
Vol just so you can stop thinking Lev is some evil woman talking about you and then restricting your access...<br>
<br>
I was the one that had your access restricted.<br>
<br>
I dont make passive judgements on people...I wait until I can at least see them in action for a while, and get a feel for their attitude.  From the moment I ever saw you, I could tell you had to be the biggest &quot;uber guild&quot; ass licker of all time.  You never talked about crap in EQ other than killing something &quot;the way BotS does.&quot;  You are apart of DROW on DAoC.  You came back to EQ and would have loved to be in them in EQ...but poor you, ya didnt have a lvl 60 toon.  So once finding out you couldn't get Xienna back, you try to get Blaal.  Dont think for a second that your true intentions of getting Blaal and then joining BotS weren't known.  The minute you would have gotten Blaal, you would joined BotS and VoF would never see you again.<br>
<br>
Please stop insulting our intellegence as you are trying to do here.<br>
<br>
The saddest part I guess is that it means nothing that you are gone from VoF.  It means nothing that you were ever a part of VoF.  Most importantly, no one cares at all about your BS story to slander an old friend that didn't want to sell you HIS account.<br>
<br>
Have fun Vol, hope ya get uber<br>

Oh, I'm sorry. He ebayed, that turns him into an EVIL LIZARD CREATURE, I forgot, sorry, forgive me plzthx.<br>
Vryu's quite a nice guy actually...I remember speaking to him after hearing about your stuff.  Because I'd spoken to him before, I knew that first of all he was A) Not an evil lizard creature and B) wasn't exactly the kind I'd expect to just go and delete equip.  And then I heard on /gu about some stuff...some lies - oh yes, that'd be you.  You're the one vindicating Vryu and Lev and everyone else in VoF for being such terrible, horrible and - and this is the funny part - &quot;pathetic&quot; people.<br>
<br>
Now, also about your little comment about VoF hating DROW?  Har har, shot yourself in the foot again because, surprisingly enough Drow is just another name for darkelves...and there are quite a few Dark Elves in the guild, aww sorry mate :~( Your argument sucks.  <br>
<br>
But, getting to what you actually meant, I really don't think you're correct there, as per usual.  I quite like BOTS.  When I first saw Mistabone's second name, I giggled to myself.  Cholly once helped me finish a quest.  Xroft and I used to be in the same guild.  I have no problem with BOTS, unless they're doing something OBVIOUSLY WRONG, such as KSing or exploiting something I myself or my guild are going after - Neither of these have ever happened to me, and thus I never had and never will have a problem with bots.  <br>
<br>
The problem I have with YOU is your insulting of people who are, were, and still ARE my friends.  Levlenna manages to keep control of raids better then your sorry arse could ever hope to - and i saw you playing at the Sev raid.  No I don't have a side comment.  It's more of a point, that's the only time I did see you play.  Or was it Vryu?  I dunno.  <br>
<br>
And seeing as you've decided i'm speaking mumbo jumbo, I've decided that i'm going to PICK APART THAT COMMENT! Mwowaha! And so I skiddadled along to dictionary.com, and found this - <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> mum·bo jum·bo or mum·bo-jum·bo (mmb-jmb)<br>

<br>
The beauty of the matter is that you're being made to look an absolute prick.  And you're embarrasing yourself further by digging yourself a bigger hole then ever before by trying to defend yourself by saying you spit on ebayers...and yet you yourself are one, because you ebayed Xienna.  Oh-hoh! Who's laughing now, batman?<br>

I HATE fruitcake.  But the thing is, is that you're the spiteful one.  Notice that Vryu posted 3 times on this matter, only to prove that you yourself were lying (and later that was backed up by Lev), and you've posted what...10 times, 15?  Each one riddled with spiteful little jabs at people...Stop being such a hypocrite.  And I'll be very, very surprised if anyone but Death and Mayhem Nation take you now...Ouch, actually, na I don't think you're good enough for 'em bro.  <br>

<br>
I used to think highly of you when you were in the guild.. You were pleasant and well spoken, but to see the way you are acting here on this board frankly takes me back.  I can see there maybe some anger and upset in the situation that has arisen between these accounts that have been banded about, but to act in an immature manner is doing your credibility no good at all.<br>
<br>
Have you decided that your times is over in the realm of Everquest and you shall go out in a blaze of glory?.  If you have then you are doing a fairly good job of it, but as everyone knows... What goes around, comes around.  Be careful not to step on too many peoples toes.<br>
<br>
All I can say is I pity you Volitile (tis a fitting name now it seems) and hope you come through this feeling better soon.<br>
<br>
And please.. You know as well as I know that Levlenna is far too mature to even dream of deleting someones equipment.  The accusation you have made there is  thoughtless and unjust.<br>
<br>

I know as everyone else does that Lev would never do such a thing. If you read the post in the VoF private section she accused all who had my account info of possible people of deleting my gear excluding herself from the list. I was just making my point. Yeah, I've been angry, but people who had nothing to do with this decided to step in and I'm not one to back down. I know I sound like an idiot with the these dumb posts it feels more like a two year old game than anything else now. <br>
I also have no intentions of leaving EQ just because a select bunch of VoF people hate my guts now. If everyone had that attitude hardly anyone would play.<br>

<br>
No dear.. if you read the section (which I have just done) you would see that Levlenna announced to the guild all the people that she knew had access to your account.. Not anywhere in the posting was a mention of her saying/stating that these people could have deleted the items.. That is an assumption.. and as they old saying goes (blimey, getting good at these ! *smiles*) .. To assume makes an 'ass' out of 'u' and 'me' !.  What she was saying was that were there any other people besides the ones Levlenna knew of that had access to your account ?  You may remember the posting I placed on the board before Christmas where my account was hacked and I lost some things.  It does happen and will continue to happen.<br>
<br>
So all I want to say is please please.. Be careful how you tread and how you speak, for its hard to make friends but VERY easy to lose them.<br>
<br>
Take care Volitile... <br>
<br>
PS.. this is my last posting as I do not like to argue.. I just wanted to stand up for a person whom I have deep respect for thats all.<br>

So, you can't bring any constructive arguments, so you go and pull off a samadhi and use personal insults?  You're even more despicable then I ever thought you were.  Needless to say, all you've done in this topic is made yourself look an idiot, and turn the guild away from you, and also possibly ruined what little reputation you had left.<br>

 You bring laughter to me every day. Have you noticed how Nenya gets the respect she deserves when she posts? Its because she has tact. You on the other hand don't know the meaning so I'll let you figure it out for yourself. I respond at the level in which people post. She's obviously an adult. I'll even go as far as to say that this subject was dropped several posts ago, but you probably didn't even go as far as to read the second page to notice. Thats ok, I know children don't like to read. You are the one that has actually dragged this out even further when your own guild mates want it  dropped. As an officer of VoF you serve them well /chukle.<br>
