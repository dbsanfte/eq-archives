At least own up to your mistakes. <br>
<br>
Those who spoke up and told the truth you should be admired. I am sure it was not easy to go against your guild's actions. However, you need to make amends. <br>
<br>
For those who did wrong, I would advise you to log on and go camp RF for Trompen. <br>

<br>
I decided that ,after much thought, i could no longer stomach SoT so called holier than thou attitude.if there had been shown any remorse at all here or in /gu then i might have thought again.<br>
<br>
So I have  removed myself from the  foul stench that SoT has become.I no longer want to be part of this  guild that thinks nothing of taking someone elses camps.<br>
<br>
I am sorry i couldnt help or stop the guild  the other day.. i did try.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am sure so called *leaders* will post their  glee and joy at this here and on  sots boards but..i dont care anymore.<br>

There is something very obviously missing here.<br>
<br>
Where are the responces of the leadership of SoT? <br>
<br>
The stock answer of &quot;we won't be talking about it&quot; won't work for you here, not when the entire server knows by now, or will know by tomorrow at the latest, the actions taken in Skyfire. <br>
<br>
This is not meant for the people in SoT who were offline. They didn't do anything.<br>
This is not meant for those who were online and didn't know. They didn't do anything.<br>
This is not even meant for those who were online and helped take ragefire, and have said that they were wrong. They were involved, but they have spoken up and done what they feel they needed to do. Kudos to you, and your strength. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>
This is for those who LEAD the guild into those actions, who, as leaders, weighed the actions and their consequences, and continued on their merry way. <br>
</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Where is *your* reply? Where is *your* justification? <br>
<br>
And above all, where is *your* apology?<br>
<br>
Or at least post that you really do think that you are that elevated above the rest of the server. Above everyone else who has agreed to play in the limited sized sandbox we have, and play nice with each other, at least post to say that you just decided that you don't give a sh!t and get it over with offically.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of having to guess at your motives, or shake my head in disbelief over this fiasco, that apparently is still getting the approval of the leadership of SoT. <br>
<br>
Let me assume a few things, so we can all agree at a starting point. <br>
<br>
1. Any guild leader must have more intelligence than a common maggot. <br>
2. Any common maggot could see this was a mistake, from start to finish. <br>
<br>
The moment you zoned in, until the second ragefire was dead, you *still* hadn't made the mistake. You had EVERY opportunity up to and including that point to simply say &quot;Trompen, come up here and loot&quot;. Your mistake came when you stepped over the line, and stole an epic from someone who rightly deserved it. <br>
<br>
Therefore, we can assume that you went into this debacle with knowledge of exactly what you were doing, at the very least from the leadership side of things. Sure, your members that do not read the RTAs, lets assume again, for the sake of giving the leadership EVERY benefit of the doubt, that none of your members there knew even of the existance of the RTA's. <br>
<br>
The leadership *must* have known in advance. It would be impossible to come to any other conclusion, from the number of shouts, ooc's, tells and hell, probably a few auctions that you must have seen. <br>
<br>
There are days when, as a guild leader, I feel I make mistakes. I always end those days feeling that I should have done something differantly. <br>
<br>
I can't believe that there would be anyone who plays this game, that would log off at the end of a day in which they've stolen ragefire, and think that they somehow made the right choice, out of all the options open to them. <br>
<br>
Should we, as a community of game players, wait until your guild has finished your epics before we even try for the camp ourselves? <br>
<br>
Who wants to wait 2 weeks to have some band of ravaging FFA players come flying in at the last moment and take what they think they deserve?<br>
<br>
Please, answer those questions, let us know where the leadership stands, so we can plan accordingly when the rest of us would like to camp this dreadful mob.  <br>
<br>
To the members of Spirit of Tunare:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
While we are a free thinking group who welcomes the thoughts and view points of all members we do have some basic guidelines of conduct and policies in place. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When you signed up, did you know that those basic guidelines included camp stealing on the longest camp in the game? Did you know they included becoming virtual pariahs on the server? <br>
<br>
Will you depend on the now ignored 'mutual respect' that people once had on this server? <br>
<br>
I think that unfortunately the good members of SoT, who are very good people indeed, will find themselves the scapegoats for this very real fallout that you are no doubt finding yourself in the middle of now. <br>
<br>
What cold comfort do you offer them? <br>
<br>
And after all that, forgetting all the above for a moment...<br>
<br>
I consider myself one of the most rational people about it: It's a game, it sucks, it was rude and thoughtless, but in the end, you turn off the computer and that's that. <br>
<br>
I am not going to leave a group if there are SoT people in it. <br>
I am not going to charge them higher prices in EC or train them when I can, or any of the other really aggrivating things that sometimes happen in the run of a day in EQ. <br>
<br>
There are only a select few who actually did something wrong. But there will be a much larger number who take abuse and get hated because of it. Does the leadership of SoT want that result? Think hard about what they are telling you to do, what they are suggesting is the 'truth' in the matter. <br>
<br>
If you think, for a moment, that I am wrong, then by all means, ignore me. Forget I said anything, and continue doing what you're doing. In fact, I apologize for questioning a guild that you believe so strongly in. Not only that, if you think I am wrong, I retract in full my entire above statement, and ask your forgiveness. <br>
<br>
But if for even one moment, you think I am right...<br>
<br>
<br>
Yers,<br>

You can't speak as one for a whole guild.  Notice how EVERYONE ELSE HERE has said that they speak for themselves, not the guild?<br>
<br>
Sorry, random offtopicness gone...<br>
But I must say, it seems a bit poo that Shei could authorise getting another RF for SOT when there was a force there.  Explain yourselves, lest you save what reputation you have left.  <br>
<br>
As much as I am against the actions, however, I'll not forget my friends because of one sect of SoT.  <br>
<br>
But...<br>
This is @#%$ disgusting.  Outrageous.  Get a thesaurus, look up those words, insert them &lt;here&gt;.  You guys have plenty of epics.  When I did Zlandicar with you guys, he was down in seconds.  You do NToV.  You do bloody everything.  And yet you think that yet another one of your members - who is now into a guild that can get them stuff equal, if not better (though I'm not that sure about that...but meh) to the epic - deserves it more then someone who has been waiting for a WEEK, day in day out struggling to get on and be there for that @#%$ mob, and yet you decide that you're more important?  Trompen had people coming, and sitting there waiting for him.  <br>
<br>
And yet, you thought that you'd save yourselves the wait, by forsaking the list, and your honour, by sending in the UberForce2000 to crush it before they could get enough there.   Now, stand back, and realise how this looks to others.   For examplé, those on rotation with you.  Will you do this to them?  No.  I guarantee SoT would never do this to anyone on their rotation at such a blatantly obvious and stupidly overt way.  <br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Respect.  By the sounds of it, Shei merely thinks that anyone with a &lt;-Spirit of tunare-&gt; tag is of a lesser caste to that of SoT, and if a guild can actually be good enough to be on a rotation with them, then they better try and keep a little bit of respect for them in reserve. Though, let me make this clear again, I still like all my friends in SoT.  I have NP with them.  Except if they were there at RF, and have shown their blatantly lack of remorse at this act of absolute @#%$-wittedness.  No, that isn't a word.  <br>

&quot;Stayed clear of all the traditional server up mobs given the whining that has been going on. Honestly, peeps must be bored again. I suggest you all mind your own business and go enjoy yourselves on your own raids instead of getting another case of SoT envy.&quot;<br>
<br>
So stop whining ya'll.  It's not like SoT stole someones epic and over a week of his time, sheesh.  Go find something else to do and stop being 'bored'.<br>
<br>
To the members left in SoT, nice f'uckin attitude.  You guys are class, pure class.  But hey, it's just a game.  You guys are allowed to be d'icks and support d'icks.  SoT is full of d'ick supporters .. raise em up high folks! <p><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/lohkisig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulohki.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lohki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/23/02 9:22:34 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.noble-blade.net/images/lohkihat.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: sot new low blow</span><hr size=1> That was posted the day before the Ragefire KS took fest ..<br>
