We had a great turnout... so much so that I had to turn a few people away <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       but I'd rather have to turn a few people away than have not enough show up and have an unsuccessful raid.  If you were turned away, fear not... I am keeping track of who was in role call but not on the raid, y'all get priority on following raids I run <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
All in all, we had 9 full combat groups and 1 53+ support group that helped with the buffing and IG clearing. Over 60 people!  Woot!  And we cleared the blemish of our previous failure off the rotation!<br>
<br>
Now me am get some food and then some sleep.  I'll edit this post fer a better recap tomorrow morning.  Heh... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
----[ EDIT ]----------------------------------------------<br>
New and improved recap:<br>
<br>
We starting taking role call around 8pm EST, and I didn't actually start forming groups until something like 9:15 or so... I was waiting for a few people I knew we're on the way but not yet present (two of them enchanters who would bring our total up to three for the night).<br>
<br>
As I said before, we had an amazing turnout. Classes we're often short on turned up in droves last night, and that helps more than you can imagine when I have to slot people into groups.  All but 2 of our 9 groups had a dedicated cleric... an abundance of clerics is getting to be a habit on my raids, and I hope it continues <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      Now if only we could manage more one or two bards in the 40-52 range...  heh.<br>
<br>
A couple people left early due to insufficient resistances, and I'd like to thank them here.  Having enough resistance to go up against Vox and Naggy (and any other large target, for that matter) is crucial, and being willing to sacrifice your slot in the raid because you don't have those resistances shows great consideration for others and for the success of the raid as a whole.  People leaving early for this reason is something that happened against Naggy as well, and it's something I'd like to continue.  Thanks also goes out to Yizelar for cracking the whip on this subject. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
I'm not sure when we finally got started moving in (I wasn't exactly paying much attention to the clock at that time...), but once we got settled in the King room things went pretty quick.  Talovar basically chain pulled everything but the lair spawns before we even moved up into the Diplomat room.  <br>
<br>
We had a few problems with people running too far forward when the critters were being pulled in, and not staying back when being shouted at... so I'd like to say a few words about raid discipline here:<br>
<br>
I'm aware that Ice Giants and the spiders and icy terrors that get pulled while we're clearing the way to the lair aren't really all that dangerous.  The Fire Giants we pull on the way to Naggy are far more likely to result in casualties if people are in the wrong place or too far forward, and even they are pushovers when it comes to other mobs we fight on other raids...  But that doesn't mean you should stop listening to raid and group leaders just because you are in a &quot;low threat&quot; area.<br>
<br>
Vox and Nagefen are the easiest &quot;Large Targets&quot; in Norrath.  Permafrost and Nagafen's Lair are by far the least dangerous &quot;raid zones&quot; in the game.  So think of them as a training ground for yourself and for CoG.  Raid discipline is not something that you are born with.  It is a learned behavior.  If you do not practice it on early raids against &quot;easy&quot; targets and zones, you will not have it later in places where being out of position will get not only you, but the ENTIRE RAID killed.  And I'm not kidding here folks.  If you are in the wrong place in a zone like Plane of Fear or Hate, you can pull unwanted mobs to the camp and get everyone slaughtered.  I've seen entire raids wiped out because a single person was standing just a few feet beyond where the raid leaders had told people not to go.<br>
<br>
So use these early raids to learn to listen to raid leadership and be able to pick out (and follow the orders contained within) shouts during the heat of battle.  Being able to listen not only could, but WILL save your life on some future raid.  I guarantee it.<br>
<br>
<br>
And now on with the recap:<br>
<br>
Once we moved into the Diplomat room and got settled, Kefo, Destava, and I went forward to pull the critters contained in Vox' lair out.  At one point I actually agro'd Vox and she followed me quite a ways down the hall... Kefo and Destava must have had nerves of steal to remain FD'd and watch as the beast literally walked over them to get to me.  Word to the wise:  Paladin's are not stealthy creatures. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
After the lair was clear, Talovar took charge of creating the buffline.  We had a problem early on with a few too many garbage buffs being put on, but it was corrected as soon as people were aware of it, and the bulk of the people on the raid didn't miss out on any of the &quot;important&quot; buffs at the end of the line.<br>
<br>
Something I failed to mention as we were moving towards the buffline was that Permafrost is lousy with pit-traps around the lair area... I know we lost a few people down them even before the charge started.  I'll make a note to give better warning of that in the future... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
I started the strategy session in the chatroom a little early (I think I was actually finished by the time the last buffers had joined the channel).  Again, a note on discipline:<br>
<br>
We hold these chatrooms before an assault so that everyone is on the same page when we actually attack.  If not everyone understands the strategy involved, we're a hell of a lot more likely to fail.  So, in future, please be a little more courteous and less spammy when the actual strategy discussion is going on.  Just because you are an old hand on raids like this doesn't mean everyone else is.  If a raid &quot;newbie&quot; misses something important, they might just get you killed as well as them... so it's in <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>everyone's</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> best interest to make it easier for everyone else to listen in and get a clear picture.<br>
<br>
Also, no one... no one at all... ever... is to leave before the designated raid leader says to go.  If you leave early, you could miss something important.  If anyone but the raid leader says &quot;go&quot;, please ignore them.  Likewise, if you are not raid leader, do not, under any circumstances, ever, tell anyone to leave the chatroom and go back to the game.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Everyone</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> wants to kill the dragon, probably none more than me!  But our best chance at succeeding (on any raid, not just Vox) is to be organized and disciplined.<br>
<br>
And now back to our previously scheduled prgramming:<br>
<br>
After logging back in from the chatroom, we assembled groups pretty quickly, and the assault began!  Two waves of tanks, and wave of pet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     (yes, I think we only had the one pet on this raid) went in.  Enchanters went in to begin draining mana at about 75% life.  Nukers went in at about 50% life.  Stunning and bashing started at about 30% life.  Vox started running when we got her down to around the 'a' in 'Lady' or so... and before I could turn around to find her, she was dead.  I don't think she got any decent heals off, I sure didn't see her life move anything but down. Vox died just after 1:10am EST, and FoF/CoG gets to keep our slot in the rotation.  Yay! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
After Vox was dead, we waited until everyone's corpse was recovered and ressurected (with the one exception who's body was stuck in a wall and had to be pulled out by a GM).  I'd like to thank everyone for being patient (especially Celestrial, who's body was stuck... it's not easy to sit somewhere waiting for CR while you know everyone else is rolling on all the &quot;ph@t l3wtz&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ).  A few people were a little tired and rattled (myself among them), but Vox raids always take a while for corpse recovery... those darn pits.<br>
<br>
Congrats to all who won items from the beast.  Kudo's to Kagaruk who got the killing blow, and to Vudu's group of Fatelan, Albaiin, Kranos, Rayanna, and Aftermath for getting the exp from Vox.  That will, I think, be the last time I put 3 nukers including the 2 highest level wizards (!) in the same group... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
I'd like to thank Talovar, Edina, Belce, Holik, and Bainzeal for helping out with pulling, buffing, and keeping re-spawning critters off our back while we we're busy fighting Vox.  A single re-spawn rampaging through the healers is all it takes to make for a real nasty outcome to a raid... eheh.  I'd also like to thank Dominatra for keeping on the ball as Primary Assist with Talovar madly pulling everything in our path without a break!<br>
<br>
Kranos and Kellory (as well as Celestrial's guild-mates) also deserve mention for staying around and making sure everyone got out and for waiting while a res was arranged when a GM finally got Celes' body free).<br>
<br>
And lastly, I'd like to thank my own group of Lenenae (it's not a coincidence <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ), Kefo (it's not a coincidence either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ), Destava, Falchor, and Eandyar (who replaced Twotribes who had to leave early).<br>
<br>
Thank you all for coming, and I hope to see everyone on more CoG raids in the future!  We're getting stronger, folks... and maybe we'll be able to take out bigger and better targets sooner than we'd thought. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

On a more serious note, I think Zatriz is done with his dragon raids for the time being.  With my time in EQ growing short with the impending arrival of DAoC, I am going to concentrate my efforts on my warrior, Mencar Pebblecrusher (some of you might recognize this name, and yes I am the original).  I'd like to see the other side of things, and actually see some of these monstrosities before they die.<br>
<br>
If things get really bad, feel free to call on Zatriz. <p><hr>

Special thanks to my group, Azketh, the lovely Judimar, Danoiele, Kavaran and Andellar.  You guys rocked and thanks for listening.  <br>

<br>
Well, overall I was very please by the raid.  I think it really proved what CoG can do.  While we did have a support group along for the ride, I believe most of it was still done by the 52 and under.  Due to my stance on support groups on our raids I wasnt originally planning on attending this raid as a raider but only as a porter and perhaps in a support role if things went bad.  Personally I'm glad Kommisar talked me out of that idea. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Talovar did mention that he turned down Valoran's help and I would like to thank him for the courage that must have taken, especially considering that we had to succeed this time or lost our spot on the rotation.  I think we proved what we can do and that we dont need a bunch of level 60's to hold our hands. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Things went very smoothly overall I think.  The only major problem I saw (I dont count the mess ups in the King room, that always seems to happen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) was in the buff line.  Somewhere someone miscounted the number of buffs that were being given out and by the time they made it to me at the end of the line, some people had too many buffs on.  This caused several problems.  Cold and magic resistance are two of the most needed spells and having to stack people up while I dispelled them and hope I didnt dispell something important took up time and caused confusion.  Still, things did sort out in the end.  A note to the buffers tho.  I know this was the first time for many in the buff lines, but if your throwing junk buffs, only throw the ones you've been told to.  We have 16 spell slots for buffs and correctly done, each and every slot will be used.  There's no room for improvisation here.  If I need to dispell something and it turns out to be MR that tank might suddenly turn into a very pretty ornament under Vox's feet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Also, unless your a cleric please dont pass up any buffs.  They are there for a reason.  Especially things like rune.  Yeah, its expensive but a) you paid for it already, and b) it might keep you alive that extra 10 seconds for an additional nuke or critical hit.  Also its one more spell Vox will need to dispell before getting to your Cold Resistance.  <br>
<br>
Also, in the chat room.  Please do not, and let me repeat this, do NOT spam the channels.  I know everyone is excited and wants to go in and kill.  But do not endanger the raid by spamming.  Considering one of the spammers was a guild officer I find that sort of unprofessional.  Only the raid commander and those they designate may give out instructions and tell people when to leave.  If you're not them, please be quiet.  I'm sure that you know what to do, but on CoG raids there are many newbies, for whom this might be their first large multi party raid.  They need that instruction and it needs to be clear.  <br>
<br>
But for the most part these were just minor problems.  Everyone still worked together and we got the job done.  Vox went down hard in under 5 minutes.  And even though we had some problems pulling corpses out of the pits I heard of very little complaining.  Especially from that bard that got stuck in the wall.  It took us something like 2 hours to rez her but to my knowlage she never complained about it.  That was the kind of patience we've been talking about.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Everyone, I and mean everyone, did a great job.  And I'm happy Kommisar talked me into attending.  It certainly made my week. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I had a blast!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
My first Vox raid was the night before and due to the holiday and a few other problems it just didnt happen.  In fact I spent part of the evening waiting for a res from the pits.  So last night was only the second time I stood before the Lady....and it totally rocked.  I had been somewhat jaded by the prior fail so it did me a world of good just to be there last night.<br>
<br>
Thank you to Dogedme for showing me the ropes of Pit CR.  I actually had a job I could do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and thanks to Celesial for being patient.  I felt terrible that I could not drag her corpse out of the wall. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also thanks to the big Ogre warrior whose named began with a K (sorry terrible with names lol) who won the Crystalline spear and then gave it to me.  All in all the night was a big success for me and I will be back.  <br>
<br>
Thanks again!!<br>

I was hoping a rogue would get that spear.  That's an awesome rogue primary hand weapon.  I think the ogre's name was Kagaruck.  That's really cool that he gave it to you.  In my opinion the crystalline spear should only go to rogues.  Enjoy!<br>
<br>
My thanks to Kommisar and to everyone for making my last dragon raid a success.  At the beginning of the raid, I had just a half blue bubble left into 52, and I was worried that since my party was getting most of the IG kills, I would ding into 53 too soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
And yes, that was me putting on glamour with my Jaundiced Helm at the beginning (doh!).  I thought that there would be room for a pretty good level 39 (and thus harder to dispell) junk buff, but I had miscounted the buffs, and I'd like to apologize to Kommisar, Talovar, and Kellory for that.  <br>
<br>
Also, next time don't forget Talisman of Altuna!  That's an extra 250 hps, which would let tanks last one breath weapon or two claw attacks longer.  By the time I realized that no shaman had been assigned this buff, half of the raid party was done with buffs and it was too late.  In a couple months I will have Kragg, which is 450 hps or so.  Mmmmm, HP Goodness!<br>
