<br>
First of all, Iraq is a far worse mishmash of ethnic groups than Afghanistan is. If we can't bring order to Afghanistan then why would we fare any better in Iraq?<br>
<br>
Second of all, why should your average Iraqi feel remorse for what happened on Sept. 11, 2001? For the past ten years, they have seen U.S. fighter jets fly overhead bombing buildings and killing Iraqis in the process. Noone ever talks about the collateral damage inherent in such activity.<br>
<br>
The world was rightfully outraged at the death of 2-3000 people on Sept. 11, 2001. Why aren't people outraged over this:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.iraqi-mission.org/deathnumbers.htm">www.iraqi-mission.org/deathnumbers.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Sanctions imposed by the U.S. and Great Britain that deny vital humanitarian aid and food are now killing 5-6000 Iraqis every month. This is a great way to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people. Saddam is a tyrant for sure. Making the Iraqi people pay for his stubborness is inexcusable.<br>
<br>
Arab nations are going to get nuclear weapons. It is inevitable. If not Iraq then Iran or someone else. The Middle East is going to have to adjust to a new reality with nuclear deterrents on both sides of the fence.<br>
<br>
The world would be far better served by diplomacy and efforts designed to ease suffering than by military force. Al-Qaeda doesn't need Iraq to continue to operate. Saddam is contained where he is. Why fuck with him now? All we are creating by fucking with Iraq is alot more pissed off people.<br>
<br>
Bush's speech to the U.N. was simply smoke and mirrors. The requirements laid out for Iraq clearly won't be attainable. The war hawks in the U.S. want a fight and intend to have one. <br>
<br>
Try and answer these questions for me:<br>
1) Where is all this &quot;proof&quot; that Bush, Cheney and Blair keep promising to deliver? Why are officials constantly backpedaling after making bogus statements that they are called to task for?<br>
2) Why does the U.S. demand that its soldiers not be held accountable to international courts?<br>
3) Did Bush write the script for Minority Report or did he simply steal it for his own uses?<br>
4) Why is the U.S. holding 1200 people at Guantanamo Bay indefinitely, without being charged with any crimes and without access to due process?<br>
5) Why was the Patriot Act allowed to pass? Why are Americans suddenly so willing to give up so many personal rights?<br>
6) What is going to happen in the future when another country uses similar reasoning to act unilaterally and preemptively against another country? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urespawn22.showPublicProfile?language=EN>respawn22</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#333333>(9/13/02 10:24:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=929.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.prodigy.net/axiotis/bart.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WAR DECLARED!</span><hr size=1> Did you forgot what Iraq did to the Kuwaiti people in 1991? <br>
<br>
War isn't pretty and if you have forgotten the Iraqi's surrendered and agreed to a agreement set forth by the UN. <br>
<br>
To this day they have not complied with the original agreement and this is why their people continue to suffer. Don't try to blame the US as to why the Iraqi people suffer - blame their government not ours.<br>

Hell, the terrorists are probably gonna get them eventually too... let's just give them some now from our own arsenals.  We've been supplying food to the Iraqi's all this time, and geeze it isn't getting to them for some reason... wonder whose fault that is?  Couldn't possibly have anything to do with Saddam Hussein, obviously anyone who gasses his own people, sponsors terrorists, and uses torture wouldn't possibly be misusing the aid we've been offering.  And heck, he's not gonna comply with the UN demands anyway, so let's just give up and let him do what he wants.  Come on people, think about what you're saying here. <p><P>

<br>
you think the United States is gonna root out and kill every terrorist that exists? You think if the US keeps acting the way they will they will only get more and more and more enemies? September 11th is nothing but foreshadowing my friends. In this day of technology, no matter how powerful a country is, when it develops enough enemies like the United States has, it WILL find itself in serious trouble. <br>
<br>
I don't understand why you think other countries fighing with each other is terrorism but what America does isnt..<br>
<br>
think outside the box here...<br>
<br>
You think they kill each other for no good reason? They kill each other for the SAME reason America does. Economics. Profit.<br>
<br>
The spreading of democracy. what a thing. While America is monopolizing the WORLD by setting up puppet leaders, monopolzing oil by keeping the countries it is found in under their control, they just keep telling the American people they're doing it to help people. To spread Democracy.<br>
<br>
What a load of horse shit. and you ALL buy into it. <br>
<br>
The guy in this post that targeted me and merely insulted. Listen to yourself. you are doing EXACTLY what I said you would. That image of America is SO DEEPLY ROOTED in your head that anybody who questions it deserves to die!<br>
<br>
Christ if America REALLY wanted world peace and world safety then why do they do everything for themselves? Why don't they do things for everyday people? <br>
<br>
You want an example of America not caring about innocent people? Want to know the story of why America supported Sadden Hussein and why they eventually turned on him? (information taken from various documents, text books and studies)<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein has been in power in Iraq for a long, long time. However during this years, in 1979 to be exact, his brutal repression led to a popular and Islamic revolution where he was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  overthrown by the people</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. As soon as a popular government came into power, they begun a new system where the nation's oil stayed in the nation. The US disliking this new twist and fearing that other nations may get similar ideas, chose to support Saddam Hussein and give him a chance back into power. He was given support with developing weapons of mass destruction as well and its use against his own people and against Iranians. This was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  downplayed by the US in the media</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. The US sends him weapons and money as he fights a seemingly endless war against Iran, murders his political opponents, and gasses the Kurds. <br>
<br>
In 1991, Saddam is pissed off at neighboring for undercutting the price of oil. He invades. The US forms an international coalition to “liberate” Kuwait. . For more than 40 days and nights, 177 million pounds of bombs fall on Iraq – the most concentrated aerial onslaught in the history of the world. The US uses cancer-causing depleted uranium weapons; they bury soldiers alive; they bomb retreating troops and civilians. At the war’s end, the US turns its back on the Kurds and other anti-Saddam forces While Saddam remains in power, US sanctions and continued bombing keep food, medicine, and clean water from everyday Iraqis. According to the UN, over one million Iraqis have died, half of them children.<br>
<br>
<br>
America doesn't care about everyday-people. America doesn't even care about the world America cares about itself. It's had the same attitude since it was created and yes as somebody else pointed out, it is also evident in World War 2 where they quite simply ignored Germany's attempt to take over europe (now THATS democracy!) until they were brought in by Japan.<br>
<br>
<br>
I want you Americans posting on this thread to realize something. This is something you do not realize not because you are stupid, but because you are sheltered from it.<br>
<br>
The American government got what was coming to them. Every country in the world knows this. Every government thinks this. Hell even the Canadian Prime Minister (and Canada is known as the country that usually just follows in America tracks) recently denounced American(Western) actions, blaming them for the state the Middle East is in and the threat of attacks like sept/11 and the potential for future ones.<br>
<br>
90% of the world's population do not like Americans. That is not because they are jealous. That is because your government is arrogant and selfish and it hides this from all of you, making you arrogant and selfish too. <br>
<br>
You want evidence your government is selfish, not caring about the state of the rest of the world, driven only by personal economic success and at the same tricks you to think otherwise?<br>
<br>
Because there is tons. Look at Vietnam. Look at World War 2. Look at the gulf war. Look at the US-Syrian war in the 1950s. US vs Indonenisa in the 50-60s.  The congo in the 60s. East timor in the 70s.<br>
<br>
The US sticks it's nose in all kinds of places it shouldn't for econmic reasons...... and doesn't get involved when they won't profit.<br>
<br>
It's evident everywhere and it's coming back to you. I hope, for your sake, that you can monopolize the planet before it's too late.<br>
<br>

At that point the person ussually apoligizes, and the quality of service increases ten fold. <br>
<br>
my friend's sister was in Paris, and they were getting the worst service known to man, and she asked the waiter for something he acknowledged the request and when he turned around he mumbled some stuff under his breath. My friend's sister spoke french however and knew that he said some not to pleasant things about Americans. When he brought her what she asked for when he eventually got it for her, she thanked him in French, and she said he got the weirdest look on his face. That's when she informed him that they were Canadians. He begged for forgiveness, and after that point it was the best service in the world.<br>

I know if you go into a travel agency they tell you to wear a maple leaf pin somewhere, but nothing too big, just enough so that people can see it and identify what it is. If you go all our for the Maple Leaf jacket/hat combo and whatever else you can get your hands on, apparently the people just assume you're American and trying to get better service. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upeterlies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peter Lies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#333333>(9/13/02 12:26:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=929.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In response to my 90% figure..</span><hr size=1> That was my point really.

<br>
I think the ideal place to live in terms of success economically is the United States. It offers security (for the time being), incredible amounts of opportunity and is quite in the lead of our age.<br>
<br>
However I do not think America is the ideal country. I do not like the way the government acts and I do not like the way America's don't have a clue about the truth of their own country and my only goal here is to give them one. I wouldn't want my kids to be Americans.<br>
<br>
Personally, I will likely live in Canada for the rest of my life.  America might be a great place, or even the best place, to live and to succeed economically, however I don't think it will give you success as an individual. To be entirely clueless as to what the government you support is really about just isn't something I'm looking for, and to be completely blind and arrogant toward major issues concerning the world isn't a quality I'd want.<br>
<br>
Besides, there's more to life then success economically and Canada has many positive characteristics that America does not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukorelor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Korelor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 671<br> <font color=#333333>(9/13/02 12:41:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=929.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WAR DECLARED!</span><hr size=1> The pussification of Europe was complete a long time ago, it's already spread to Canada and infecting this country. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxaenneax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaen Neax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 495<br> <font color=#333333>(9/13/02 12:46:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=929.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://webpages.charter.net/philipv1/small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: for the person arguing that terrorists will get nukes..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Uh .. hi. The cost of gasoline in the USA on average is about 4-10 times lower anywhere else in the world. Why? Because of where we buy it from. Yeah, when the middle east decides to do whatever, guess how much it goes up by? You guessed it, on average 20-30% .. Just as much as we buy from them. <br>

Crogon, your figure of 90% is off by a ton. You complain why do we only help ourselves and not everyone else. Have you compared the money flow from our country from whatever country you're from for various issues that YOU might find more vital? I would hazzard a guess that the USA is indeed outspending you in every aspect you complain about. Africa? More money donated than any nation. Palestinians? More money donated than any other nation.  Food, Supply, Medical Aid? More man hours, effort, and money than any other nation.<br>
<br>
Tony Blair was right when he called on the rest of the world to unite to become a super power of it's own. Because the USA has been doing everything, while the rest of the world sits and watches. Wouldn't want to donate TOO much money to help those Afgans rebuild their country, would we? Nope, let the USA do it all. While your country lets people starve, the USA will be there trying to feed them - I guarantee it. Don't mind us if we're constantly patting ourselves on the back. The only reason we do it is because no one else will. Lazy...<br>

However, he isn't directly to blame for the deaths resulting from sanctions.<br>
<br>
9 years of sanctions have annihilated the infrastructure there. It is so bad that they fear a major environmental catastrophe due to an inability to repair oil pipelines and drilling equipment due to lack of spare parts and tools. Agriculure and environmental problems have increased dramactically as well.<br>
<br>
Food and temperature-sensitive medicines can't get to where they're needed for one major reason. Temperatures in Iraq can climb to 130 F in the summer. Refrigerated trucks are basically nonexistent in Iraq since the sanctions committee has banned them due to &quot;dual use&quot; concerns. How well do you think we could transport food in the US without refrigerated transportation? <br>
<br>
On top of this you have major warehousing problems. Equipment arrives in parts and must be assembled. However, parts rarely arrive together so things like dental chairs must sit there for months.<br>
<br>
The UN knows where food and medicine is going and has clearly stated that it is a logisitcal problem rather than malice on the part of the Iraqi government. That isn't a useful bit of information for CNN to use to demonize Saddam though so people stay ignorant.<br>
<br>
Wate, sanitation and electrical production facilities have all collapsed along with the other infrastructure due to 9 years of sanctions and lingering Gulf War damage.<br>
<br>
Sanctions target the weak and vulnerable. They don't address the problems at hand. <br>
<br>
As for gassing his own people, let's stop being quite so hypocritical. We supplied him with the capabilities and essential said nothing when he used them during the Iran-Iraq war more or less. Our enforcement of the no-fly zone is supposed to prevent Saddam from attacking his own people. Why do we do nothing when Turkey flies into Iraq, over the no-fly zone, and bombs Kurdish communities? I would love to hear your defense of that type of hypocrisy. Oh that's right. It's perfectly acceptable when the country in question is your ally.<br>
<br>
The U.S. is going to come away from this whole mess looking like a bully more so than it already does. We are also going to polarize the Arab world (among others) squarely against us and mortgage any hopes of peace in that area for years to come. This is all going to occur at a time when the U.S. is essentially the one superpower in the world and thus the obvious target for anyone wanting to prove a point, exact revenge or further any of a number of agendas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucrogonmeadowlark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crogon Meadowlark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Professional Victim</span><br>  Posts: 1223<br> <font color=#333333>(9/13/02 1:02:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=929.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WAR DECLARED!</span><hr size=1> the only reason you do it is so the government looks pretty when people say &quot;holy shit look what the fucking United States did to x&quot; <br>

Whether it's Palestan, Afghanistan, whatever. The american government does it only because if they don't they will look bad to their own people.<br>
<br>
You want to know the kinda shit Americans did pre-sept 11 in Afghanistan?<br>
<br>
Back when Russia was still in Afghanistan in force, the US wanted to get in there and keep them out. They assisted the afghani's by giving them weapons, money and other resources needed in a war. (boy did that come back to haunt them)<br>
<br>
They paid for and published text books for students at Afghanistan schools. These books were full of american propoganda and anti-russian sentiment, (hi cold war) the students were taught addition using bullets, math using distance to explosion. <br>
<br>
The americans owe Afghanistan way more in damages then they will ever pay.<br>
<br>
The US spends more $ on their military per year then it would cost to feed the entire population of the world.
