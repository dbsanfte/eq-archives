I'm doing it again.<br>
<br>
Funny, as I'm reading through this post, I'm recalling a long conversation myself and a couple of buddies from work had last night.<br>
<br>
We were discussing the ways of dealing with terrorism, of dealing with Saddam Cumstain, and generally speaking, the ways we could deal with any of those &quot;Countries&quot; that don't like us. (I use quotations around this word, because without the United States, most of these people would either have no home, or would be rampantly anarchist.) <br>
<br>
My standing on this topic is, that while war is effective, it costs the US more time, money and human life than the people against whom we are warring. The US is notorious for blowing up a country, or being involved in the blowing up of a country, then being the only souls in the &quot;International Community&quot; to help with the efforts of rebuilding. The French, who apparently hate us so much, owe us much for the rebuilding after WWII (And, we didn't blow them up, the Germans did) the German people owe us their entire country, most of the Middle East, at some point, has received mass efforts of aid, and assistance from the US. <br>
<br>
Funny how easily forgotten these things are, after only a generation or two. Funny how the very peoples that we gave aid, assistance, or in some cases, LIBERTY, hate us so. Funny how the United States leftist regime focuses not on these things, but seeks to build internal strife by accusing the government (only while there's a Republican president, mind you) of being hate/war mongers.<br>
<br>
Well.. Let me be president for one year. Please. I would only do one thing. No wars, no major economic changes, no radical right wing policy. I would cut off ALL foreign aid, I would close down the American borders entirely. Nothing coming in or out for one year. The United States is self-sufficient.. How many other countries out there are? How many of these people that hate us would cry in their Budweisers when we don't let their immigrants in, or send them medical aid? How much hate for an American Empire would there be, when we quit rebuilding cities in other countries after earthquakes?<br>
<br>
I don't like this American hate. I think it's unwarranted, and from those within our own borders, it's disgustingly left wing, and entirely argumentative. <br>
<br>
In closing, try to open your eyes to the good things the United States does. Ask yourself, &quot;How many other nations offered the US aid when downtown Fort Worth was blown apart by a tornado? How many other countries offered the US aid when wildfires and mudslides defaced most of California?&quot;  When you come up with the correct answer to these questions, (It's zero, to the slow among you) think a little harder about criticizing America's &quot;Evil Empire&quot; foreign policy.<br>

Even if we do go in there and clean house...in another hundred years everything will just be the same.  Different leader..same agenda.  The Middle-east is conflict, always has been and always will be.  The majority of the people there have nothing to live for besides their religion, their family, and their fight to keep those two things.  The conflict is engrained into their society, it is a part of their everyday life.  They have been taught it by their fathers and grandfathers for a thousand years.  Besides..It is Fucking hot over there..ALL the time.  And not alot of drinkable water either.  That combination would make me pissed off 24/7 too.  <br>
<br>
This will be the most worthless long-term war.  Nothing will be solved except the killing of a leader and his regime.  And in the long term, that won't even change anything, because in the Middle East...Might makes right!  The person with the most military power will soon have complete power.  The next regime like Saddam's is right around the corner.  Iraq isn't going to fucking become Disneyland because Saddam is ousted.<br>
<br>
You are not going to be able to just set up a Democratic society and government in Iraq.  You need at least some popular support to pull off that (not to mention divine intervention).  Do you really think that the majority of Iraqians are simply going to worship us as saviors?  Or do you think we should hold &quot;Democratic Elections&quot; for them under the watchful eyes our our military.   Because that is not democracy chief.  They have been hating us for a long time and an invasion of their county is not going to help matters.  Look at frickin' South Korea.  Ya...They just love us don't they?  Korean War really looks worth it now doesn't it?  Things are really close to being at square one over there again and it's only been 50 years.  Hell, if we decided to pick up and leave South Korea (Like they want us too), how soon before North Korea started having ideas again.<br>
<br>
You can't police the world in the 21st century.  Some things are beyond (and should be) our control.  We need to focus on getting OUR country through the hard times.  We need to focus on OUR children and how to help them become intelligent, compassionate, and thought driven adults that will help save America and the world in the future.<br>
<br>
In closing...If this was only about Saddam, he would already be dead.  Our intelligence community would have been able to take him out a long time ago.  One sniper shot through the frontal lobe and Saddam is no more.<br>
<br>
To be honest I don't know where I stand on this.  I don't really know if the US is abusing their military power over a weaker country, creating a &quot;Valid Reason&quot; to help out our nation by hurting another.  I would love to believe that the US is trying to help Iraq by geting hid of Saddam, but if that is the case, then why isn't he dead already?<br>
<br>
I do want to thank our soldiers in the military that VOLUNTEER to watch our borders and let the rest of us sleep safe at night knowing you are doing so.  I just hope you and your lives are not being wasted and abused for economic reasons.<br>
<br>
We will see...<br>

<br>
I'm in the military.  I am a medic.  I get out soon.  If we go to war I'm likely to be put on &quot;stop loss&quot;.  That is I'm not allowed to get out for X amount of time.  If that happens I'll probably be deployed.  Doesn't bother me, I think that possiblity was implied when I signed up.  Freedom isn't Free people.  <br>
<br>
If, (see that word, IF) the draft were reinstated and those Americans who so take their &quot;freedom&quot; for granted were actually at risk of having to defend it.  I think they would march to the tune of a different drum.  Instead they sit back in the very protection they mock and criticize it. They would probably even burn their draft cards.  Hell we may even have another Bob Dylan out there just waiting for something he can spew pseudo-hippy babble about. (I actually like Dylan).  Fine that's their freedom that someone else fought and died for.  Ingrates.  I'm rather disgusted at being part of the ME generation, as my generation is sometimes called.   To my fellow Americans, have some faith in your government.  The institution is greater than any one man.  If you aren't being served to your liking then take the freedom that was paid for with blood of our fore-fathers and VOTE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therealdrache>TheRealDrache</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A great example of...<BR>

Than you for supporting and serving our country.  Most people don't take the time to thank service men/women anymore.  The Hooplah of 911 is dwindling as is the want to be supportive for ur country.<br>

I like our nation to exhaust all means possible before resorting to war.   I will go and die for my country no matter what the circumstances of our involement whether we are right or wrong.   This I wished to have as pretext for what I am about to say.....<br>
<br>
      Do not try to bring morals into our reason for going to war with Iraq.     Fuck morals.    Saddam is a son of a bitch murderer and so is his son.   He kills his own people and places little value on human life....   Who cares?   not us.    Human rights violations take place everyday.  In North Korea they are developing nuclear weapons and are fantastic human rights violaters.  Mass genocide took place in Africa in the 1980's.   Links supporting terror can be traced into Saudia Arabia.  China is a wonderful Human Rights violater, I can go on....     There is much  &quot;evil&quot; in the world.  In many of those situations we use dipolomatic intervention, but we sure have not and are not about to go to war over any of them.   We aren't heroes in fairy tale books who run around righting the wrong.    We intervine militarily when there is an invested interest.      <br>
    Back in 1990,  Saddam Hussein had his army invade and take control of Kuwait.   We as a nation could not have him controlling our oil prices.   You like driving your S.U.V around town?   Being able to own and heat a 4 bedroom house?  Not having to pay $5.50 per gallon of gas?     Ya me too.    What makes you think if Saddam developed advanced nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons he wouldn't invade Kuwait or surrounding countries again??   The man thirsts for power.  It's all he lives for.  We crushed his army like a bug back in the early 90's.    Now think for a moment if we had to make a return trip 5 years from now because he reinvades Kuwait or a neighboring country .  Only this time he has invested some cash in arms development.   We'll be left with 2 options.     1. Pay Saddam outrageous amounts of money for our oil or option numero 2.   Go to war again, but like I said under this new scenario he has weapons of mass destruction.     lol... we'll have some wonderful looking soldiers return home for the grand parade.   (Those that aren't left as festering diseased corpses lying on top of some sand dune in the middle of no where.)<br>
  Maybe I'll even get to go on this tour.   I can come back with half an arm and a face boiled into a puss filled  bloody mess due to the effects of some chemical weapon ol' Saddam has developed.  They might even put me on the cover of Time magazine and call me a war hero.   My beautiful blushing bride by my side who I can't even fuck to get pregnant cause I'm left sterile after the war.<br>
  Oil. That stuff that keeps this nation running on full.   That black shit you need in your vehicle so you drive back and forth from home to college to see mum and dad for thanksgiving to bitch about those warmongers in Congress.   No it's not about morals.    We let injustices happen all around the world.   Why don't we turn a blind eye here?    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/29/03 9:52:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=78>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hay it's my furst post.</span><hr size=1> Great post Fyir.

Despite all the evils in the world, not many of them hit US soil. Chinese and North Koreans didn't fly planes into buildings in NYC.<br>
<br>
Whether it's about economics, morals, or anything, the fact remains that there are thousands of dead Americans and this guy, whether directly or indirectly, is linked to what caused it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=toricseerson>Toric Seerson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 210<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/29/03 11:05:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Different idealologies</span><hr size=1> I am very curious as to where the proof is.<br>
<br>
The partcular sect of Moslem to which Saddam and most of Iraq subscribe to, is in complete opposition to the denomination that the Al Quida belong to.<br>
<br>
In fact it is that very difference which inspired the religious leaders of Iran to invade Iraq to try and impose  a more strict interpretation of religion on Iraq.<br>
<br>
It is far more likely that the Kurds who we are protecting ..are in fact trading with and harboring terrorists under our very noses, than that Saddam would even tolerate them in his country.<br>
<br>
The difference between teh majority of Moslems in Iraq and the beliefs of the Al Quaida is far greater than between Catholic and 7 Day Adventists.<br>
<br>
I would believe the Pope would deliver mass in Salt Lake City, before Saddam would aid Al Quida.<br>
<br>
But yall keep buying into the Bush Propaganda program ...don't bother to do any simple research for your self...that way you will feel so much better when innocent civilians die under american bombs in Iraq.<br>
<br>
And for the record I am not a college student going home to mommy and daddies house. That ignroance might have played well during Viet Nam before people woke up...but give me a break. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=161&stop=167>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=1010.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=1010.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=1010.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=1010.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1010.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1010.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> -
