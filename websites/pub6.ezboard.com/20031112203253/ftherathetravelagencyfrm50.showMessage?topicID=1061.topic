<br>
EQ upgrades that have made rotation mobs easier:<br>
<br>
- Level 65 (vs. level 50 cap)<br>
- Better Weapons<br>
- Better Spells<br>
- Better Armor<br>
- Better Abilities<br>
- Raid Channels<br>
- Chat Channels<br>
- Alternate Abilities<br>
- Advanced LFG functions<br>
- Augments<br>
- Well-Known Strategies<br>
<br>
<br>
It is, and has been for a long time, quite realistic for small well organized groups to take down many mobs on the rotations.<br>
<br>
LDoN has now made the availability of more advanced gear also more realistic to the non-guilded player. It has also created an environment where building a larger raiding group is much easier. With all the current people looking for an LDoN adventure at any one time, it is much more possible to get a group of 12-24 players together these days.<br>
<br>
So the question remains, why are these rotation mobs still the exclusive property of RTA rotation? Why can't the warrior that is not guided, who does not want to join a guild, just go out and create a raid from the LFG's and go after his epic pieces?<br>
<br>
Many players are obviously in guilds, should they be kept from helping out on such a raid?<br>
Should they be penalized if they do help?<br>
Why should a guild have any say over what a player wants to do with their own time, especially if it involves helping out another friend in-game?<br>
<br>
Players in the past have been forced to guild life because of their pursuit of higher level gear and the harder challenges in EQ. Is it now not as necessary to be in a guild for those things?<br>
<br>
Should guilds, (and thus the RTA), be able to dictate to everyone what mobs (and items), they can and cannot kill and loot?<br>
<br>
Obviously the RTA rules have no authority over non-guilded players, and they can do as they please. But only under the threat of RTA sanctions and black-listing. Also no guilded friends could be involved or thus suffer similiar sanctions, which could also be brought against their guild.<br>
<br>
The RTA has had its value and place in the past, being used strictly for application to mobs that only guilds could realistically attempt. Thus creating an order and efficiency from the chaos of FFA. But somewhere along the way the RTA decided it could apply its control over essentially any mob for whatever specific usefulness it had, and now reserves those mobs exclusively for guilds, where guilds and guild features are arguably no longer necessary to defeat them.<br>
<br>
So the question remains, &quot;Is the RTA irrelevant today? And if so for which mobs, or for all?&quot;<br>

Stop looking at the RTA as a power structure. Its an administrative tool. Member guilds agree to allow eachother an opportunity to try mobs, and in turn, they get there uncontested chance later on. No one forces you to join the RTA. The 'punishment' aspect of the rta isn't them mandating policy on you. <br>
<br>
Im not going to spell things out for you. The RTA operates much in the same way an IGO does. Read up on some international political theory, and get back to us with your educated proposal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 1396<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 9:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1061.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://a.domaindlx.com/Gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ?</span><hr size=1> The RTA becomes irrelavent to a mob when no guild really wants to kill it any more.

<br>
The RTA has become a power structure. It makes rules, and now threats, promises retribution, and defines who can and cannot have access to resources in EQ.<br>
<br>
You apparently missed the entire point.<br>
<br>
Players do not need guilds to do what generally was impossible without one previously.<br>
<br>
That is the issue. Not how well the RTA deals with helping guilds schedule mobs to be killed. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://yourguild.com/yourguild_profile_open.php?id=czoxOiIxIjs=" target="top">Zewt's custom profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

However, the rules are made by anyone who decides to become part of the RTA so that becomming a part of it is always better than going against it.  In theory, however, anyone who does not want to follow RTA rules should not care about any of the retribution methodes used by the RTA (blacklisting, etc.)  The reason this actually has an effect on people that do not want to be part of the RTA is because the RTA has become so huge that it is representative or possibly 80% of the Rathe population, and if you have 80% of the people blacklisting you, that's not good.<br>
<br>
There is only one flaw with the RTA, however, and that is that it refuses to consider the solo player or non guilded group.  In order to be part of the RTA you must be in some sort of raid entity.  This is with good reason.  There are so many loopholes that could be abused if the RTA considered the solo players.  However, I do believe it is about time for the RTA to begin considering such solo players, or small non raid groups (let's say, 12 or less) because they are now powerful enough to kill RTA protected content, and thus should be somehow represented here.  If not, the RTA is basically telling the solo/non guilded player that , sorry, you are not in a guild so we cannot give you protections of any sort, but we will still limit your content, and if you don't follow our rules (which only limit your content, and do not benefit you in any way) we will still blacklist you.  I don't think this is right.  So, just like there are FFA days on the calendar, there maybe should be FFA days on some rotation mobs.  Maybe once per rotation you can have an FFA, or even twice if the rotation is too long.  And no one on said rotation should be allowed to kill the mob on an FFA day, so that it's only FFA for those who are not on the rotation.  Or maybe there's another solution.  But I do think one needs to be found to consider those who do not want to be guilded, without allowing them free access to mobs over and over.  <br>

The Rathe is a Calendar/Rotational Server.  It won't support non-guilded folks trying to take down Rotational Mobs.  You know why?  Clan Bashemded, New OutRiders, Grave Wisdom, Clan X, Frayed Knot, Noble Blade, Tindi'Losi, BotS.. just to name a few, WANT it that way.  From the biggest to the smallest newcomer to a Rotation.  Small guilds have Allied to get on the Calendar and  take down Rotational mobs.  They then split up, and each earn their place, too.  Why?  Cause they WANT it that way.<br>
<br>
The guilds that didn't.. KEG, Requeim of Souls, Dark Breed of Norrath, half of MFH.. SPLIT TO ZEB when it was opened.  They wanted the FFA atmosphere, and now they have it.  Go ask them how they like it?  Oh, wait, except for LD (MFH'rs that went over) almost ALL of those guilds have mostly folded now.  Dark Horizons and LD grab all the mobs they want, as they spawn.  Not much left for the &quot;little guy&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here on the Rathe the &quot;little guy&quot; has just as much chance at mobs as the &quot;big guy&quot;.  The &quot;big guy&quot; has to step aside and say &quot;your turn&quot; to the &quot;little guy&quot;.  And the &quot;little guy&quot; steps aside for the &quot;big guy&quot;, too.<br>
<br>
So, in order to keep the peace, this place was created back in 1999.  The Rotations/Calendar were placed here to keep track of what folks were doing off-line, in their heads.  Now it's simple, go look and see what's up.  If it's your's, you take it down.  If it's not your's and you're on the Rotation, you leave it alone.  If it's not your's and you want it, you have every right to kill it and enter the Rotation.  Then you wait your turn, just as all the rest do.<br>
<br>
Does everyone like it?  No, can't say that they do.  However, it WORKS.  There isn't nearly the strife and argument here, with GM intervention, as there is on other servers.  Go to another server, and ask.  Yes, the &quot;Big guild&quot; guys will tell you that they are perfectly happy with the situation.  But, ask the &quot;little guy&quot;, who constantly gets beat out for even the easy mobs, how they feel about FFA.<br>
<br>
So, no, the Rathe isn't kind to the non-guilded.  But, since most of EQ is geared towards guilds, why is this such a shock?<br>
<br>
And before you continue on.. C4, by the nature of having a Web Site and a Chat Channel IS a guild for all intents and purposes.  They just don't have a Tag. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=juryiel>Juryiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 1:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1061.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So for what mobs has the RTA become irrelevant?</span><hr size=1> Btw, I'm not in C4 nor associated with them in any way to make that clear.

If so then IMO the RTA's bias to guilds only having rights and not non guilded people is wrong, and I personally would not support any blacklistings or punishments made against people who are not related to a guild and kill a rotational mob.  I wouldn't break the rule, but I certainly would not help in enforcing the consequences in such a situation.  It's just unfair and selfish to place limitations on people if they do not also benefit from them. <p>Lich Juryiel Shadowangel<br>

You're not being original with your request in the least.<br>
<br>
I'll answer you what's been answered before:<br>
<br>
Who will police it?<br>
<br>
Who will be there at EACH and EVERY FFA day to make sure that no one guilded with a Rotational Guild is participating?<br>
<br>
Do you know the name of every person who is in every guild on the Rathe?  I sure don't, and I don't think anyone else is either.<br>
<br>
The answer to this request has always been:  if you're unguilded, and you really need your Epic Piece, or whatever it is you desire.. you have friends on the server who ARE in guilds, ask them if you can tag along on one of their Raids and pick up the item they need.  It's been done, many times.  Guildies ask &quot;if no one need x-piece, I have a friend who does, can he/she come along to loot it?&quot;, the answer, if no one in the Raiding Guild needs it, has always been &quot;yes&quot;.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you don't have any friends on the server, I guess you're SOL. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roggulbuk>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><marquee>Newbie Admin!</marquee> <BR>

<br>
See, we could have a representative from several guilds at this free for all day, to make sure that no guilds participated, only unguilded people, since that would be double dipping. <br>
<br>
Then, we could make sure those same representatives, or someone with a list of people from the LAST FFA attempt, were at every kill so that people could not double dip into the mobs that were FFA. <br>
<br>
We'd have to make sure that people didn't actually think that FFA means &quot;free for ALL&quot; though, since what it means is actually &quot;Free for everyone unless you are in a guild&quot;, so in a shorter way, that's &quot;free for some&quot;. <br>
<br>
So, who would like to chaperone the FFA on Zlandicar, Trakanon, Sev, Dain, Klandicar, Statue, hell, most mobs that are on rotations from velious on down?<br>
<br>
No one?<br>
<br>
<br>
Alrighty then... :P<br>

If you were to add a FFA slot to all rotations, I'll guarentee you that 98% of all kills will be from guilded individuals.  It would be Lodi all over again.  And I for one am not willing to take that risk for the ONLY real source for the warrior epic.  I for one still wield mine and I know there are people in every guild on that rotation that still want to do theirs.  If Sev went FFA, then someone wanting to buy a new horse for an alt would park his butt in EJ on pop day and two-box him as soon as he popped.  While you are organizing a group of non-guilded people this &quot;uber&quot; person will solo...kill...and be in the bazaar in 10 minutes auctioning a GDS.<br>
<br>
Before you mention there are other sources for GDS, I'll bring that up.  The only other source is Hoshkar.  Hoshkar is in VP, and that's alot more detail to get into while you're keeping up with everything else.<br>
<br>
BTW, people can say the warrior epic is useless....but if I'm in a zone where resists aren't that high (for instance HoH) I regularly pull taunt off of people weilding BoCs without hitting my taunt button.  It's 200 less agro, but a 175pt DD on the 2HS version.  If I can pull taunt off a BoC without trying I don't call that useless.<br>

RTA is just a tool ... wait tool? No, not a tool. It is a group of elitest FUCKS. An unguilded warrior should be able to orginize a raid of friends (guildless or not) to help him down sev to get his green scale. I mean seriously he shouldnt have to BUY it off the bazaar from someone who's guild raided it. What happens if this warrior does that? he is blacklisted and &quot;harassed&quot; (if you will) in game. And what of the friends that helped? The unguilded ones are blacklisted. And the guilded ones? Either their guild is forced to /GR them or deal with getting a bad rep. And why this? I don't know, because some guilded people think that it is &quot;orginized&quot; to give all the bigger names to the guilded people. Doesn't seem fair. Personally im all behind the c4 people. I hope that even after getting blacklisted they continue. Yeah their methods might not be totally agreed on by myself. But if that is what it takes to get the point across, then so be it. Look at it this way. Either your with the RTA or your againist them. Thats alot of people to be hated by, just because you don't believe in their &quot;orginiazion&quot; or &quot;respect their wishes&quot;. Well maybe I should make the RTO &quot;The Rathe Orginazion.&quot; We choose mobs that we want to share between other people. And when someone else needs it for something or wants to kill it. They have to follow all or rules. Or we will hate them all and blacklist them. Lets start with Phinny, Venril Kathor (sp), Gore, etc .... Oh wait do you need these mobs for your epic? too fucking bad, either join us or be blacklisted mother fuckers. I'm not saying the idea of the RTA is evil or irrelevent. I'm just saying that some of the rules could be shoved up your ass. Personally I'd rather have the choas of people trying to farm things with the FFA ability, then the &quot;lets share these mobs between us guilded people, and blacklist all our uposers.&quot;<br>

<br>
Yea it should be only for mobs a single average (non elemental / non VT) group can do.<br>
<br>
It's not just &quot;adding a slot.&quot;  Those who made the system need to find something, it doesn't have to be this.  Either that or stop making a fuss when people who don't get any benefits from the rules break them.  The way the system is run now is hypocritical.  However, if i was in a respectable guild, I wouln't want to attack something as gimp as sev and risk someone finding out and losing my server reputation and guild.  I would think this reason should be enough to keep the majority of people who could one-group these and are already on the rotations from killing them again. <p>Lich Juryiel Shadowangel<br>

In every conflict there are always 3 options...<br>
<br>
1. hold you ground<br>
2. give in<br>
3. seek compromise<br>
<br>
Personally I'll<br>
<br>
1. Hold my ground - that as an unguilded person completely outside of the RTA I have the right by SoE's own rules to take down any mob not already engaged<br>
<br>
2. give in - that what I did with Serv may not have been the most &quot;socially acceptable&quot; thing or even very polite<br>
<br>
3. seek compromise - maybe seek is the wrong word demand like it or not fits better<br>
<br>
GIVE UNGUILDED PEOPLE A CHANCE AT ROT MOBS -- failing to meet this demand will cause more striff for the members of the RTA then it could ever possible cause me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bogfatherbellybarsh>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.mmmonkeybusiness.com/jesterav.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><marquee>Superfreak, superfreak, I'm superfreaky!</marquee></span><br>  Posts: 2343<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 7:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1061.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So for what mobs has the RTA become irrelevant?</span><hr size=1> Don't strut so hard, Zewt.<br>

Providing all these people are unguilded and not belong to guilds that are part of the RTA community. You have that option to either work within the system or without the system. If you choose to work within then you need to get a guild or real alliance. If you choose to work against, continue to organize and do what you want. However don't be shocked when the status quo or whatever you want to call it shuns, ignores you. You can make that choice and no one is taking that away from you.<br>
<br>
If you make the choice to not work within the system then the only real strife will be yours, finding out that you've been shunned and people ignore you. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.protoculturex.com/pictures/senzillsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
