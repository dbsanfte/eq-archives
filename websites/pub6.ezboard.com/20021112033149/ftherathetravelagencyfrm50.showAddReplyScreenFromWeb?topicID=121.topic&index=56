Now there are 5 or so guilds on this rotation, and the named spawn at all times. What if the 3 others ALL would prefer the drakes to be FFA instead? Does the majority rule in this case? How would this be handled?<br>
<br>
-- This would bring up a case of 'using the rotations to your advantage, while at the same time, ignoring the rotations to your advantage'  It is unacceptable, and has come up now and again thru our history.  If you do not wish to follow established rotations, for your own good (read: banking drakes until you can kill doz) then the 'rotation machine' will not be abliged to protect your other mobs you have safely reserved for you, whatever mobs they may be.<br>
<br>
in a nutshell, you cant sit on the fence, regarding the rotational system.<br>
<br>
and ill restate whats been said 1000 times above:<br>
<br>
- dozekar: ~7 day pop, drops 1/2 the items for the CoV quests<br>
- drakes: ~ day pop, drops other half of the items for the CoV quests.<br>
<br>
---if you kill drakes, and can't kill doz, you are (a) oblivious to what they are for/how they are handled (forgivable) (b) self serving, and planning for the CoV quests, looking to gain a head start.<br>
<br>
There is really no other alternative.  If you are planning for Doz/CoV quests, then you are 'sitting on the fence' as it has been clearly (and rationally i think) explained why these 2 entities (doz+drakes) are treated as a single package.<br>
<br>
Please, trust me - when you enter the doz rot you will highly, endlessly appreciate the drakes protected for YOU, when you are up.<br>
<br>
--edit:<br>
<br>
to directly adress jurassic's question:  This still applies to the 'sitting on the fence' analogy -<br>
<br>
&quot;I want a mob(s) ffa when it serves me, but damn right, i still want statue of rz, tormax, zlan, etc.. to be protected by a rotation for ME!!!&quot;  its principles, you are either pro FFA, or pro-share/rot.  It is impossible (ethically i suppose) to pick and choose how you want to act, as it serves you.<br>

<br>
Verant screwed up BADLY when they put the drakes on such a random spawn timer.  The drakes will be in the way of guilds pulling for armor, and rotation guilds will have difficulty waiting until the drakes are fully spawned to clear them.  The drake symbols -are- the bottleneck in all of the most desirable Dozekar quests, the drop rates are horrible, and you can typically farm enough tears to complete 4 quests before you can get the symbols to complete one. <br>
<br>
Verant should put these drakes on a three-day spawn timer and then we can -could- just call the drakes FFA and be done with it (Although you guilds who still need Skyshrine armor might not realize what a nightmare that would be to your farming attempts when you add NB/Tindi and BOTS to your competition for HOT).  Verant hasn't done this however, so we must make do as best we can.<br>
<br>
Now, to speak against my fellows...  BOTS, Tindi and NB: Get off your asses.  If you want to be on the Dozekar rotationt then be prepared to accept the responsibility for the nightmare of that rotation.  Dozekar needs to be a TOP priority.  On spawn day, you guys need to be sitting there waiting to catch drakes.  That's simply what it takes to be responsible for the other guilds who need to farm the armor that comes out of there.<br>
<br>
I speak against BOTS here, because they're ahead of us in the rotation and that's just the guild I see, but too often BOTS will be busy doing more important things and pass Doze/named late in the day after the drakes have already been robbed.  The rotation passes to Noble Blade and we see that we've been passed Doze and one or two of the eight drakes, and of course we pass rather than 'waste' our turn on a worthless doze kill (We don't really need many tears) and one chance at a symbol rather than eight.<br>
<br>
This is why the stuff gets left up so long.  If you're on the rotation, make it a priority on the level with your VT farming or whatever your doing at the moment.  Take responsibility for a difficult rotation, and don't leave the stuff up to be stolen and then pass the buck.<br>

<br>
You want Named Drakes FFA?  Fine.  I'll be there with 20-30 NB EVERY patch.  We NEED Named drake to finsh quests, not Doze.  You think you can beat NB, TL and BotS to Named?  We all need them to complete our quests.  Every patch we will be there, killing all the armor giving mobs, because yea I have some twinks that could use armor.  BotS will be 3 screens away camping 2 other Named, and Tindi will be in another spot camping those named.  Every 7 days, every patch.  This is what will happen if Named Drake go FFA.  You think you'll get alot of armor farming in while we're there?<br>
<br>
Or... Doze and Named are treated as one rotation like they are now.  The guild thats up for Doze comes in once a week, for 2-3 hours and then is gone, and you can farm armor all the rest of the time.<br>
<br>
You think we wouldn't love for named drake to be FFA?  We complete 1 Doze quest every 1-2 months now.  If named drakes were FFA we would be there everytime they spawned, making sure we were there before you to kill them.  We could probably complete 3-4 quests in the first month alone.<br>
<br>
But thats not what rotations are about.  Rotations are here to fairly share the resources of the server between all that can kill them. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unicolaiironcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicolai IronCross</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>tba</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 6:58:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=63>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A few months ago...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yet, the &quot;Dozekar incapable&quot; guilds would sure like to get a head start collecting those elusive quest items prior to getting themselves on the Dozekar rotation so that when they are capable of doing Dozekar each kill very well may represent another completed quest. I don't blame them for this either.&quot;<br>
<br>
The reason most of the Dozekar capable guilds are asking for this is because of the rotation system itself. We as a community agree to share nicely on the big important mobs. These drakes constitute a directly necessary linke to Dozekar. There is NO other use for the named drakes. <br>
<br>
If Dozekar himself was FFA, then it is highly likely that the guilds sniping Nameds (knowingly, not the accidental stuff) would *never* or *extremely rarely* ever be able to even USE those symbols. Sharing is a give and take, and has a long history of being a double-edged sword on this server.<br>
<br>
From my personal observation, this is one of those blatant instances where the tier 1 guilds are taking it in the rear by playing nice.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Edit: Figured I would answer Jurassic with my speculation <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *<br>
<br>
Technically, I would think that all entities that are currently part of the rotation get a say; but the original deal was those guilds who founded a particular rotation (in this case, NB and Tindi) set the policy as long as either is active in the rotation.<br>
<br>
It's a house of cards obviously, and always has been. People depend on the good intentions of everyone involved for this to work. Obviously, from the tone of the posts by NB, Tindi, and BoTS.. they don't feel like people are acting with the best of intentions in regards to this situation.<br>
<br>
I will re-iterate what Milambus pointed out though, just because someone has access to the named now (mainly because half of the rotation thinks people are leaving them up per the agreement)... doesn't mean that same someone would *ever* see them if they went FFA.<br>

<br>
<br>
Yes it does have to be this way, and Emil's post does answer your question.  Doing it any other way is counter to the whole concept of rotating mobs to share amongst those who can benefit from the mobs in question.  The Named without Dozekar are nothing.  Dozekar without the Named is nothing.  To use rotations to your favor (i.e. ensure you get shots at Dozekar) and then ignoring the parts you don't like (i.e. wanting to grab not just your share of Drakes, but everyone's) is greedy and self-centered.<br>
<br>
As for your VP analogy, if the symbols for Doze quests were 8 hour ground spawns all over Velious, I can promise you, NB would have a lot more Doze quests completed.  I would also say that anyone not in a guild that kills Trakanon who collects VP key pieces is wasting their bank space.  I would say the same about VT shards.  If you aren't in a guild actively gathering Emperor keys, you are just wasting your bank space and preventing other players who can use those items better.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I would caution you about trying to make the Named Drakes FFA, as I would make sure that NB took full advantage of said system, if only to prove a point that rotations benefit you a lot more than they do &quot;the big guilds&quot;.  I prefer to share the pie as equally as possible, but if you don't want to play nice on the playground, we can go that way too. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

Because of that (being fair), they are now getting screwed by snipers because they can no longer get whatever it is that the Named mobs drop along with their Dozekar things.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of folks fail to realize that HoT can be cleared (minus Dozekar) by a single well equipped, experienced group and Dozekar can be killed easily with 3 groups of the same.  I know the few times BotS has killed Dozekar we've done it at around 3am or later Eastern time with 17 to 24 people.  It would eventually fall to being a pick-up group situation where people of any guild would group and go kill the mobs and split the things they drop if it went FFA, and that is something that is hard to compete with even for the larger guilds. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 9/16/02 4:10:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilambus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 822<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 7:03:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/profile/fist1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A few months ago...</span><hr size=1> Jurrasic to answer the question: <br>
<br>
Rotations rules/etc are created via discussion.  If all the Doze guilds got together and after discusion agreed to make the named FFA then thats what would happen.  Its not just a simple vote for each rule.  Rotations are package deals that are compromises that the guild on the rotation make.<br>
<br>
So can the rule be changed?  Sure.  Can you convince the other guilds that such a change is best?  Maybe.<br>
<br>
Glyhed/Exiled is a new rotation that took alot of discussing to get the exact details worked out.

For Karadin for the 4th time I have no intention nor does FK of pushing for the drakes to be made FFA, that's not at all what this question was about. It was just a very handy and relevent example. <br>
<br>
And back directly ON the doze/named situation, I hope Borick's excellent post dosen't get buried.<br>
<br>
 If 'elder' rotation guilds kept closer tabs on the named (yes Verant sucks for making them random) there will a lot less 'sniping' from groups camping armour or doze capable guilds looking for symbols.   <p>Jurrasic Epoch <BR>

True, but if every guild capable (or soon-to-be capable) of Doze is acting with good intentions on this rotation.. it should only rarely be an issue.. instead of a constant one.<br>

I guess what I really wanted from my post was to see the gentlemen's agreement between the top tier guilds, and I'm glad that they are doing it so that other guilds can see it, view it, and respect it. I think by doing this, similar problems like this can be avoided in the future when new guilds get onto the rotation.<br>
<br>
Thanks for doing this guys (NB/BoTS/TL and others).<br>
