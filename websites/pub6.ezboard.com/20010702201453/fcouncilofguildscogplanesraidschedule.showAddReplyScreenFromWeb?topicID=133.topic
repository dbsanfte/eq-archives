A number of successful (and some not so successful) planes raids. A great chess tournament put on by Pippi, a Valentine's Dance. Some good Mixer raids put on by Stonescale and the Peacekeepers. All in all, it's been a good year in 2001, and it followed the successes of the KCoG in 2000. We have a number of people who are excited and dedicated to bringing more events to the CoG. <br>
<br>
It's been a good run. Now, I must announce that the Sacred Band alliance, consisting of the Silver Daggers, Illuminatus, Fell Omen and Storm's Justice, is passing on its leadership of KCoG Dragons and planes raids. I've pondered this decision long and hard, and discussed it with members of my guild and the leaders of the Sacred Band alliance. When we first decided to take up the responsibility of leading CoG planes and dragon raids, we knew that eventually, we'd get large enough and practiced enough to do these raids on our own. While providing the service of leading and organizing the raids for the CoG, it was always in the back of our minds that we would eventually have to do these raids on our own. We would get enough members that we'd either take up too many spots from the CoG, or have to turn our own members away from raids. At first, this wasn't a problem, but it has become increasingly apparent that we are at that stage. To be fair to my own guild and my allies, I have to take us to the next level. <br>
<br>
I have contacted some raid leader candidates out there, to see if they will take the mantle of CoG raid leadership on their own, until their own guild/alliance is ready. I would very much like to see these events continue for those guilds out there that are not able to do them on their own, or are not in an alliance. Anyone that is a Council guild that wishes to take up this job, please email me at haemish@mail.com and I'll help you as much as I can. There are some qualifications you'll need to have in order to lead these things, the primary one being adherance to the ideals in the CoG vision. <br>
<br>
This past Sunday's Vox raid was the last Sacred Band-led Dragon raid, and this coming Sunday (April 15th's) Hate plane raid will be the last Sacred Band-led plane raid. I have not reserved a plane for next week for the CoG, as I need someone ready to lead the raids before I commit the CoG to another raid. I will be keeping the CoG in the KGC dragon rotations for a week or so, and if a leader has not appeared to lead the dragons raids by that time, I will pull them out until such time as they are led. I will remain a spokesperson for the CoG on the Karana Guild Central board. The Sacred Band will also continue to host events outside of these type of raids, though what form they will take isn't set (we could come up with another chess tourney, or a newbie tourney, or another walking tour). <br>
<br>
We've shown that with time, effort, organization, and discipline, these type of raids can be done by a loose confederation of guilds and individuals. The CoG can accomplish greater things if we keep at it. <br>
<br>
Long live the Karana Council of Guilds!<br>

There will be some minor changes in the way things are run, owing to a slightly different style of the FoF from the SB, but the best news is that the CoG will still be providing planes and dragon raids for those who are not otherwise able. Many of the members of this guild have participated in dragons and planes runs with myself and the other members of the Sacred Band, and they know how it is supposed to be done. Their philosophy coincides with the SB's philosophy and with the basic tenets of the CoG. <br>
<br>
Like the Sacred Band, they want to run these events not only to provide a means for their own people to reach the planes, but also for others who could not otherwise see the planes to do so as well. Like the Sacred Band, they intend to also use these events to train their own members in running planes raids so that they can one day do their own planes raids. When they are ready, I'd like to think they can pass on the mantle of leadership of these events to another guild or alliance, and I'd like to hear from anyone who wishes to run these events in the future after FoF. <br>
<br>
The only downside is that it will take them a few weeks to get organized and ready to do them. They are looking at running at least one plane event in early May, perhaps 2 in the same week (one of which will be a special event). Keep your eyes on this forum for details, as well as for the other great CoG events that are posted here. If a Dragon comes up between now and when they run a plane run, they will be going after it, so watch the dragon raid forum AND the mailing list. <br>

We Have been Looking over the SB/CoG policies for Planes/Dragons and making a few modifications to them so they fit more to our view how things are done. These will be posted shortly when they are posted, PLEASE if you have concerns post them, input is always good wether its good or bad.<br>
<br>
Yes, we will be running a Special Event, in May.  Still Planning it out, so no Sign up yet. As soon as we know we can run it we will let you in on a little more info <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
