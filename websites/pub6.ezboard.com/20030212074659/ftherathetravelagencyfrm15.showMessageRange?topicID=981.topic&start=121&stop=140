<br>
The fact the BotS is slow &quot;uberguildwise&quot; stems from other reasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
*FK delaying tactics probably stems from that fact that is has being a favored Tindi tactics for months when they hadn't yet realised they were tools and still thought they could kill it. (Thank god for VI expansions or they'd still be struggling).<br>
<br>
<br>
*Whereas it is true NB took several months to go from Glyphed/exhiled to Cursed, they never once bothered the guilds that could kill Cursed.<br>
In fact, as usual for them, they always went out of their way to make sure that their being on the Glyphed/exhile duo didn't create any trouble at all to the Cursed guilds.<br>
<br>
*Considering the history of NB on our server, i can't understand the mindset ift would take to even consider thinking of maybe screwing them on a mob. <br>
TM delaying tactic is easy and lame.<br>
<br>
If i were NB, i'd have a Shammy/tank duo permanently parked in basement and i would kill a TM every 1h30 just so you learn but then again i am a vindictive bastard.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karadin>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM<BR>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Please correct me if I am wrong, but was NB's first Cursed kill not more than a couple months ago?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, our first kill was end of November.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yet you have been on G/E since at least September, which is as far back as our Rotation site goes apparently. For a guild who spent at least a couple months on just the GLYPHED/EXILED rotation, you guys are quick to forget your past and package it all into one big threesome kill.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, we don't forget that we were on G/E rotation for a few months, but we were only on that rotation to get to Cursed.  If Glyphed, Exiled and Cursed spawned in three different locations in Ssra, we would never touch Glyphed, and be close to autopassing on Exiled.  I didn't package the three together, SOE did.  You can't get to Cursed, except via killing Glyphed/Exiled.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>At best you attempted Cursed every time you did the cycle and lost, which would still be &quot;blowing&quot; the spawn. Which is also a misnomer because you can get to the cursed spawn just find after killing the pseudo glyph/exiled replacements.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes we blew the Cursed for several months (I don't have an exact number off the top of my head), and on each occasion we were very sure to not negatively impact BotS or (later) Tindi.  We would make sure all of our attempts were done early enough that they wouldn't interfere with the Cursed guild getting a nice, early run.  Especially on patch nights.<br>
<br>
Blowing Cursed on a patch night is no misnomer, because you have to wait for the cycle to reset.  The later you push NB (or any guild) on doing a difficult mob like Cursed, the less resources they have, and the greater likelihood of failure.  On patch nights, failure doesn't mean passing the mob, it means the patch eats him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You know better than I do that there is more than a small order of mangnitude difficulty from Exiled to Cursed. So if FK is trying to get on the Glyphed/Exiled rotation, as you did months ago, why the hell are you talking to us about how we are or aren't ready for Cursed? How quickly you seem to forget... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, because we don't care about Glyphed, and barely care about Exiled, if they spawned in separate places, I wouldn't give a rats ass about it.  But on a patch night, you were risking blowing a spawn and having the patch eat it, and were using stalling and subterfuge to accomplish it.<br>
<br>
To summarize your invalid point - they ARE a package, SOE made them that way.  There is a significant delay caused by failing at any point in the cycle.  That delay has negative ramifications for others.  It isn't like wiping to King Tormax, where the guild behind you can just go anytime after you CR. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=billybones>Billybones</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/15/03 4:47:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AL</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>cept for Petrucci, I'd have that guy's child if I could. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

But seeing my guild's name being thrown around and mine, I thought I should dip my toes in the water.<br>
<br>
First off, let me fully explain what happened between FK and Tindi. As there isn't anyone in my guild that can describe it better. Because frankly, I was the only point of contact.<br>
<br>
/flashback<br>
<br>
A few weeks (or maybe months) ago, I happend to be in tells with Jlxaac for whatever reason. He was commenting to me about how all the uber guilds were &quot;out to get FK.&quot; I asked him to explain, and he gave me examples. Basically what he described to me was every time he wanted to get on a new rotation, he took the old school back door route of keeping it a secret and silently racing to said mob. I explained that he should try asking the guild who was up for it, generally it is easiest to ask. Because when the guild who is up for the mob finds out they are being raced, instinct kicks in, and pulse quickens and the /gu &quot;EVERYONE GET TO SOANDSO ZONE&quot; is called.<br>
<br>
Here was my mistake. The very next sentance I told him. &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of course, there will always be mobs that are highly contested. You will still have to race for them.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot; I even told me if he was interested in getting on a new rot he should send me a tell. My mistake was I didn't specifically tell him which mobs we still race for. For Tindi, it would be G/E/Cursed and Blood/Emp. Why is that? There are only 4 guilds that could possibly imagine the pains we went through to get on that rot. Tindi, NB, BotS, and SoT. <br>
<br>
I wont even get into what they were, but trust me week after week after week after week, having the door slammed in your face being raced to it over and over plain and simple sucked. We worked our asses off for it, and do not intend to give anyone a free ride. At least not on our turn. This cycle offers some of the best loot available, and we dont intend to leave it up for 1 second longer than we have to. <br>
<br>
A few weeks later there were 2 or 3 FK groups in Ssra, Tindi was up for G/E/C and we made our way there. FK asked if  they could take a shot, but would need to wait to gather troops. Tindi decided we didn't want to give up the spawn and moved in. Later that day Jlxaac sent me a tell angry that I didn't keep up my end of the &quot;ask for a shot&quot; bargain. At that time I explained, we would not be stepping aside to any guild on the G/E/C cycle or the Blood/Emp cycle.<br>
<br>
In the following weeks, I experienced what most of you know as a classic &quot;cockblock&quot;. I was aware FK wanted to try the G/E cycle and when I logged on, they had about 4 people in Ssra. Tindi had about 25 or so on. So instead of going to Ssra, waiting for 10 more to do the G/E/C cycle I decided to go off KT first. I figured hey, this would give them a chance and we still needed about 10 more people anyways (mostly to loot the stuff, not to kill). Just before we engaged KT, I sent a Tindi to Ssra to check how many FK were in zone. I wanted to know if they had a raid force or not. I was told they had 14 in zone. As soon as KT dropped, I called the move to Ssra.<br>
<br>
When Tindi started popping in zone, the now 16 FK moved out of the mines, killed the Warden (one of the triggers) and then moved back into the mines. Not only did they not have any intentions of engaging the cycle, they didnt even have enough members in zone if they wanted to. I immediatley contacted the FK raid leader, and was told that they were going to try G/E. I informed them that they didn't have the appropriate raid force for G/E (and the RTA guilds on the rot agreed). We had 40+ in zone, and faced with FK blowing the spawn, (all triggers must die within a specified amount of time) I asked if the RTA would object to us completeing the cycle. All RTA reps (on the rot) said &quot;if the trigger will be blown, and you have the force to do it, then take it.&quot; We did have the force and we did kill it. Actually it was our fastest kill ever. Kinda neat having all 3 corpses in the same area.<br>
<br>
After the mobs were dead, I pushed to find out why FK did what they did. Their raid leader told me, &quot;We killed the warden because we wanted to try G/E.&quot; Not because a mob got away and they accidentally agro'd the Warden. But because they wanted to cockblock pure and simple.<br>
<br>
As for the other posts in this thread, I will be honest. I only really read the posts made by people who actually have a shot at killing these rot mobs. The others should try to stay out of it. For example, Tindi has never and probably will never kill Dain. That's why when issues with that rot come up, I don't get involved. It's none of my business.<br>
<br>
As for the post above I am confused. I am not sure if it's because it's poorly written, or if it's because I am borderline retarded and just can't understand it.<br>
<br>

<br>
I think that says:<br>
<br>
1- Tindi uses delaying tactics.<br>
2- We are tools because we tried to kill things and failed. <br>
3- If it wasn't for expansions we would be struggling.<br>
<br>
Well let me just say this first. If I am wrong about 1-3 above I apologize for what I am about to say.<br>
<br>

<br>
Noble Blade comes into the closest conflict with Frayed Knot, as Noble Blade is the 'top three' guild with the most remaining interest in the content that Frayed Knot  has their eye on.<br>
<br>
These two issues are understandable.  I can sympathise with both 'sides' in the matter.  It's not a perfect situation and the resolution to this issue is not going to make everyone happy.  Frayed Knot wants Noble Blade to get out of their way and let them try new content.  Noble Blade wants to finish gearing up for the next tier in our own methodical fashion.<br>
<br>
Frayed Knot's (collective) behavior, however, is not going to engender them any sympathy from me or much of anyone.  Your guild, through your OWN ADMISSION uses subversive tactics to get to mobs.  You LIED in this very thread by first saying that you weren't killing TM's as a stalling tactic, then changing your stripes and admitting it with sullen pride.  Your behavior is that of a truant child.<br>
<br>
Here's the deal, kiddies.  Get over yourselves and the chip you carry on your (Collective) shoulder.  NOBODY, not Tindi, BOTS or especially Noble Blade gives a rats ass about you getting on rotations.  We will not attempt to block or stall you from rotations UNLESS you act like arrogant, lying, secretive pricks.  When you fuck us, then sure, we're going to play hardball back, but rest assured that we'll maintain our honorable behavior while doing it.  <br>
<br>
Parking people in the basement and deliberately stalling a spawn while lying about your behavior is not going to win you any friends.  If you want on the rotation, make an HONEST EFFORT, not some subversive, stalling, lying bullshit cockblocking tactic.  <br>
<br>
You're not the first to the table.  You're trying to play catch-up and yes, the cards are stacked against you in some ways, but you won't find any sympathy from NB, Tindi or BOTS.  All three of our guilds had to dig through a LOT more shit to earn our places.  You get to skip past content we were forced to farm.  Every mob you kill for the first time has been balanced and in many cases trivialized by gear and expansions that we didn't have going for us.  Show a little respect for that and stop acting like punks and maybe, just maybe, the old guys will look at you as something other than a pestilence of rats. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elaundarnobillium>Elaundar Nobillium</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.stny.rr.com/drhager/sword.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Retired Admin</span><br>  Posts: 326<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/16/03 1:08:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=138>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: So...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Cuz noone fucking cares what you think anymore?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I like that fact that you began to adress the issue more broadly instead of just harping on the recent G/E incident. I, however, would like to pick up where you left off and share some of my personal feelings about this situation.<br>
<br>
  You made reference to FK's collective behavior. You used word's and phrases such as &quot;lied&quot; and &quot;subversive tactics&quot; all of which relate to one particular incident.  The &quot;Lie&quot; you so cleverly caught us in was discovered by a contradiction in posts in this thread posted by 2 different ppl.  Obviously it is totally unreasonable this was caused by one preson being misinfored of the event and just speaking up to defend his guild, even tho the other individual admitted several times that yes we killed a TM to stall till we were confident we could kill the G/E.  And yes, admittedly it is unfortunate such things happen b/c it does make us look stupid, but it still is the truth.<br>
<br>
  It also makes perfect sense to assume that we decided to use this stalling tactic on our very first attempt ever at going for G/E.  This is exactly the kind of thing that FK takes pride in doing /sarcasm off.  <br>
It is this one incident that has been brought to light on the RTA, and it could be argued FK made a bad call. But the other side of the argument is that perhaps FK felt all it's other options had been exhausted.<br>
<br>
  Now you being especially intelligent, Borick, know that it is very likely that no matter how warm, fuzzy, and other guild friendly Karadin may make himself sound on the RTA, he is not that nice in game. If he were he wouldnt' be a good GL.  So my question is this, how many times must a guild be told &quot;No, sorry, not tonight. But keep asking, eventually we'll say yes&quot; before it is acceptable to take matters into their own hands?  How long does being considerate of NB rotation turn on a particular mob take precedence over the wants, desires, and work put in by my guild?<br>
<br>
  And to your comment about NB, BOTS, or TL not caring at all about other guilds getting on rotations, well this is true. But like so many things, the truth you hear is not always the whole truth.  The truth is there are some rotations that at least NB and TL do care about us getting on. The G/E/C rot, as stated by the TL rep, is one that they'd prefer not have other guilds on for as long as possible.  Can i blame them, hell no. Cursed especially drops some really phenomanal stuff.  <br>
Of course Karadin and TL leaders are motivated by doing right by their guilds, and of course this means that in some instances a larger guild will try to slow a smaller for a long as possible, as long as Uber Guild X has an interest in farming a rot as much as possible.  It's human nature.  As it's also human nature to believe the worst in others, as is seen by people making opinions on FK based on one incident that is gettign attention on message boards.<br>
<br>
  And before you attack my &quot;one incident&quot; statement by throwing the KT &quot;KS&quot; at me, id like to say this.  The fact that the term &quot;KS&quot; is thrown around in relation to that upsets me. KS'ing implies intent. FK did not intend to go to Kael specifically to kill Noble Blade's KT even tho that's what everyone believes (Human nature again).  It was total miscommunication which we owned up to, apologized profusely for, and were accordingly punished for. So please let it rest.<br>
<br>
  One other thing that has been bugging me as i read this thread. Many many times it has been said by Karadin and others, ask a day or 2 in advance for a shot and we'll give it to you.  To my knowledge, FK rarely has done this.  It's a simple request you might think, but look at it from this perspective.  FK is a casual guild, ppl log on any given night at any given time because it is fun. If enough log on, and want to raid, and an FFA or Rot mob is up we go and kill it and all are happy.<br>
  Now, what kind of flames would you think would appear on the RTA if 2 days in advance FK leaders were to ask Karadin to give us a shot at mob X. Let's even assume Karadin say sure. FK plans to kill mob X and NB plans their night that does not include mob X.  Then halfway thro the night Karadin gets a tell saying, &quot;Oops, sorry, we didnt' have enough ppl log on to do mob X&quot;<br>
  Do you think maybe that would upset Karadin more then a GL sending him a tell at 5-6pm EST saying &quot;We have the forces in the zone to kill mob X, can we have the shot being that you're not here yet.&quot;  I dont' know the answer, but it unfortunately is a dilemma that FK must face.  Potentially a damned if you do damned if you dont situation.<br>
<br>
  This is possibly the longest post ive ever written, and it was all to try to fulfill a very few and simple purposes...<br>
<br>
  First, Borick, you are great at simplifying things to prove your points. You point out a specific point in time and use it to convince everyone that what you say is truth, and you do it very well.  I wanted to attempt to show that what really was involved with the entire G/E situation was much larger than just the climax which the RTA trolls were exposed to<br>
<br>
  Second, to try to wake ppl up to the fact that just because you read it doesn't make it true.  Karadin has done a very good job of making FK out to be some reprehensible, decietful, chip on our shoulder guild while maintaining that he is beyond reproach.  Ive never spoken to Karadin, and im sure he's a nice guy, but do i expect him to be everything he says he is on the message boards. Not a chance in hell.<br>
  Any rational person should realize that the truth is much more likely in the middle, but if you are one of those sheep that takes whatever you read or are told as gospel truth, well then god help you.<br>
<br>
  Third, to get people to see that FK is not a bad guild full of people saying &quot;Fuck everything but what we want!&quot;  It is a guild of ppl who work hard and want to succeed just as much as anyone, and a guild of frustrated people who felt they were being given no other choice but to use less &quot;pleasant&quot; tactics in order to advance in this particular instance.<br>
<br>
  Everone please keep in mind that all you see here is the bad, and what those who excel in the literary devices want you to see....<br>
<br>
P.S. It's obscenely late so i apologize beforehand for any spelling mistakes or bad grammer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 835<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/16/03 2:06:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=140>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: So...</span><hr size=1>  Borick, please go back to flaming, i'd hate to have to change my opinion of you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Anyway, now that the Glyphed/Exiled rotation business is taken care of, there'll be no more 'cockblocking' intentional or otherwise from FK in this regard, that is for certain and I hope we can all get along better in the future.  <br>
