<br>
Ok most of you know me and most of you have probably raided with me either vox or naggy but I see a lot of complaining about loot and fair roles so here is what iv done in the past for loot and roles. I consider myself fair and have yet to leave anyone behind in any raid cr or otherwise.<br>
<br>
first off when you limit the players that want to join its unfair just remember everyone has the same chance when rolling on items so it doesn't matter how many players come.<br>
<br>
you can scroll back a bit and find accurate cost and time estimates for these 2 dragons so I want get into that .<br>
<br>
the reason that dupes get called is 3 fold 1/time 2/cost 3/return this is debatable from here to forever but when dupes are called you still get to roll on all items dropped so I personally believe its fair as long as epics aren't ever called.<br>
<br>
thats how I feel about loot.<br>
<br>
now the rolling  should be more accurate by that I mean organized only after everyone who came to raid is rezzed and back into groups should anyone role on any items.<br>
<br>
once back in groups every one should role in turn and in groups making it easy to track the best roles no scrolling back you and everyone knows whos best this also keeps rolling x 5 from getting out of hand, a couple of these might still occur but just explain to all that if it happens all there roles on that specific item are void and he/she will have to wait for next item to role again.<br>
<br>
any how if all the raid leader conform to some kind of standard rolling practice things will be easier and ppl will know what to expect hope this helps.<br>
<br>
also I would keep a duplicate cof/rbb/or a click stick if they ever duped on my raid and would do it with a smile and a hardy thank you to all that were in the raid.<br>
<br>
any gems that drop in my opinion should be given to buffers  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=muglackdackfut>Muglack DackFut</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master of Mulletude</span><br>  Posts: 3607<br> <font color=#333333>(11/18/02 9:24:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1300.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LOOT and ROLLES</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the reason that dupes get called is 3 fold 1/time 2/cost 3/return<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You arent exactly leading a military crusade, the extent of your hard work is shouting in 10different zones for buffers and peeps. The buffers buff everyone, you just tell your fodder to run in and hope for the best. I've been on a cliff raid once, and some of my friends have gone multiple times, on cliffs, and those affiliated with him. I wouldnt exactly call having 50people randomly charge a dragon good leadership skills. Any half-twit idiot can say attack now.

<br>
my personal record on naggy is 23 / 6<br>
my personal  record on vox is 9 / 17<br>
<br>
but i never limmit players and never have to this point ever called or taken any thing for myself from these raids also i have never left anyone behind after a raid.<br>
<br>
also iv been on raids were after 3-5 hrs of prep get screwed by 1 person screwing up a pull or someone yelling retreat or ppl gating entire groups out in the middle of the fight or someone pulling aggro in one case bringing vox back all the way to the buff room to wipe a raid out ( wasnt my raid ) and while it in yr oppinion is so easy to run a raid i still see the same ppl running them week after week put yr time and energy into it if you think its so easy and you'll find out really quick how wrong you are about these raids / also remember these are almost always pick up raids and are subject to every kind of stupidity known to EQ.<br>
<br>
I personnally like to kill these 2 dragons and am almost always willing to go and raid them and have shown a few ppl how they work and am willing to help out werever i can.<br>
<br>
one day my pally will maxx out aa and i will be moving on till then im going to continue to raid these 2 dragons leader or player doesnt matter to me.<br>
<br>
I must retrack however one thing iv said here because there was a player  Kadah who bitched about certain ppl calling dupes and you know what hes out there leading these raids now and in my opinion doing a decent job of it Gratz bud i hope to see more of you running these raids sooner the better get out there and kill dragons ppl <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern.showUserPublicProfile?gid=phantomfist>Phantomfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sarcastic Sensei</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#333333>(11/19/02 8:01:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1300.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LOOT and ROLLES</span><hr size=1> I found this bit of logic somewhat puzzling:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>first off when you limit the players that want to join its unfair just remember everyone has the same chance when rolling on items so it doesn't matter how many players come.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
1. More people=more lag<br>
2. More people=increased chance of idiots/whiners on the raid<br>
3. More people=increased chance those idiots will mess up the raid and cause a wipeout<br>
<br>
So in other words, limiting the number of people is hardly unfair. <br>
<br>
Also, despite your claims, a raider's chance of winning a roll does in fact increase when there are fewer raiders. Last time I checked, having a 1 in 24 chance to win is a lot better odds than 1 in 40.<br>
<br>
I agree with Mug, keeping dupes is pure BS and greed. These raids don't cost a lot nor are they difficult to pull off. The typical Naggy raid nowadays goes something like this:<br>
<br>
1: Gather people by going zone to zone and joining various chat channels.<br>
2: People whine they don't have crap buffs.<br>
3: Send in 1 group of higher level players to kill all the giants. This same group also keeps any loot that drops. Loot that really should be going to the raid party.<br>
4: People whine once more that they don't have crap buffs.<br>
5: The raid party groups up and heads into Solb. On the way to the prep room a few get lost and/or eaten by a bat or bug.<br>
6: Someone trys to take over the raid.<br>
7: People continue to whine that they don't have crap buffs.<br>
8: People get crap buffs.<br>
9: High level buffers buff.<br>
10: Raid party goes in and attacks the dragon.<br>
11: People get rezed and loot is rolled on.<br>
<br>
And this is hard? Annoying at worst, but hard??? If you think your leadership is great and deserving, then do the raid the way it was done in the past. Buff yourselves outside and fight your way to the castle. Then kill the giants on your own! Once those are all pulled and killed, rebuff and kill Naggy without aego, potg, kei, etc.<br>
<br>
Leading a group of people to the buff room once everything has been killed is hardly a sign of leadership. It's about as difficult as showing a noob the way to the FP bank!<br>
<br>
Of course you can have whatever loot rules you want to have, but don't pretend keeping dupes(scales, rez stick or haste items) is something that it's not. Don't pretend that it's earned and deserved, because it's not.<br>

More people means LESS CHANCE TO WIN ANYTHING FOR EVERYONE EXCEPT YOU, BECAUSE DUPLICATE LOOT IS NOT AFFECTED BY # OF PPL IN RAID. Oh and it gives you a reason to blame &quot;It is xxxx's fault not mine! Oh and pay for your coffin by the way&quot;<br>
<br>
What kind of hardwork planning you need to do?<br>
/ooc RAID EVERYONE FROM LV45-52 WELCOME JOIN CHANNEL FOR DETAILS<br>
in Nexus, bazzar, DL, KC<br>
<br>
What kind of stragey you think of?<br>
/ooc now all charge in go go go<br>
<br>
you said gem will be given to buffer.. so you wont even pay them gem from the begining? Wow it must cost you a whoping 0 pp and it justified you a reward.<br>
<br>
Anyways, your raid sucks for everyone, but your loot rule is great for yourself.<br>
<br>
By the way, see 3 cof one time and 3 selo drum drop one time before.

<br>
Once they ever get all the possible loot from these dumbazz dragons they could want, they will have burned so many bridges with the people they screwed over (who then became level 65 while they forever remained 52), that they will have nobody to group or guild with.  Then they will need to de-level themselves back to leading vox and naggy raids to screw over the next cycle of newbs.<br>
<br>
Raid leader getting gems and vendor trash to pay for dots is great.  Raid leaders getting duplicate loot is ridiculous and people that allow that to happen are so foolish.<br>
<br>
If I were there playing a twink, I would start an anternate raid channel for everyone else on the raid.  I would have your cleric not heal so you died from AE then your cleric roll for you before your rez so you can't ninja crap or get any duplicates.  If the roll from your cleric won you an item, then gratz, if not someone else earned it just the same.<br>
<br>
One more thing, rolling 0-1000 for every singe drop is silly.  Have 1 roll for everyone there including the high level buffers and highest gets 1st pick, 2nd highest 2nd pick, etc.  That is how it is done at high level but you wouldn't know being the permanent newb.  People that roll 2x don't get loot period no matter what their roll.  People LD have their group leader roll for them with everyone's knowledge.  <br>
<br>
You want fair?  Try that system.  Otherwise I may bring my twink and take over your loot calling while you are waiting on your rez.  <br>
<br>
Good hunting,<br>

ATTENTION TARDS, you keep crying over the rules, but 30 or 40 tards are gonna follow them like lemmings, Hence, the zone to zone spamming, begging. etc. the night of said raid.<br>
<br>
So who cares anymore, this is a dead horse for quite sometime, yet people still wanna kick it.  It's just a game.  Let them be greedy and everyone enjoy the game and explore the fantasy world, while these greedy guys fiddle the tards a follow me song.<br>
<br>
And BTW Cliff, since you read any Naggy or Vox post...Stop telling people that they &quot;ruined their reputation&quot; when they point out your faults in their opinion, or when entire zones throw tomatos at you when you &quot;come'a spammin', you aren't that important..LMAO <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=1300.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=1300.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1300.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=1300.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=1300.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1300.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1300.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="namelesstaverngeneraldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="namelesstavernfrm24">Tech Support<option value="namelesstaverntradingpost">Trading Post<option value="namelesstavernfrm25">Planes Raids<option value="namelesstaverndragonsandplanes">Dragon Raids<option value="namelesstavernfrm26">Epics and Other<option value="namelesstavernfrm20">Current Affairs<option value="namelesstavernfrm8">Nameless Guild Leaders Lounge<option value="namelesstavernfrm13">Administrative Requests<option value="namelesstavernfrm28">Administration Logs<option value="namelesstavernthenamelessserverboardrules">The Nameless Tavern Rules<option value="namelesstavernfrm9">Guild Links<option value="namelesstavernfrm31">Server Links<option value="namelesstavernfrm32">Class Links<option value="namelesstavernfrm11">Retirement Community<option value="namelesstavernfrm22">The Nameless Roleplay<option value="namelesstavernfrm18">Other Worlds<option value="namelesstavernfrm30">Ask Arbaal?<option value="namelesstavernrantsandflames">Rants and Flames</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern>The Nameless Tavern</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes>Dragon Raids</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
