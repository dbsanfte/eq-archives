<br>
Yup.<br>
<br>
&gt;Is the connection speed ok?<br>
<br>
Connection speed is excellent, but video/graphics are still quite choppy in busy areas.<br>
<br>
&gt;Are the bugs being worked out?<br>
<br>
In my opinion they're doing an excellent job with the bugs.<br>
<br>
&gt;What's the jist of the game?<br>
<br>
KILL THE OMNI!<br>
<br>
The game is really what you make of it.  In my honest opinion, it is not nearly as nice a game as EQ, but it is way more flexible.  You can try to become the PvP god.  You can try to become the most well known disco dancer with pink tights and an afro.  You can solo all day and all night and make a crazy amount of money and find some awesome items, you can group all night long and gain 5 levels in just a few hours of power fighting.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Do you have groups like EQ does and exp done the same way?<br>
<br>
Grouping is very rewarding in this game, although solo play is quite possible for almost all level/classes.  Exp is done basically the same except:<br>
  *You get exp for trade skills and some other random stuff (lockpicking)<br>
  *When you die you only lose the exp since your last save.  You character is saved whenever you level or whenever you stop by one of the many many many 'insurance terminals' and pay a very small fee.<br>
<br>
&gt;Do you have levels?<br>
<br>
1-200<br>
<br>
&gt;Is there a monitary system?<br>
<br>
A virtual monitary system.  It uses credits - they don't way anything so you can walk around with a few million.  You are awarded credits on kills basically.<br>
<br>
&gt;What's the most fun class to play?<br>
<br>
Now you know that's a silly question. <p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#000000"><tr><td valign="top" width="160"><img src="http://everquest.estoncom.com/images/bishsign3.jpg" width="73" height="60" align="left" border="0" alt="Get yer foul tallard mouse cursor OFF OF ME!"><br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=3814"><font face="tempus sans itc" color="#2248FF" size="3">Bishoopugget</font></a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0042" face="tempus sans itc" size="2">Pappanug <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://pub30.ezboard.com/bnuggetsofjustice"><font color="#FF0042" face="tempus sans itc" size="2">The Nuggets of Justice</font></a></font></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="center"><font color="#FFFFDD" size="1" face="tempus sans itc">and...</font><br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=44611"><font color="#29FF29" face="tempus sans itc" size="3">Kraket</font></a><br><br><font color="#8888FF" face="tempus sans itc" size="2">The<br>narcoleptic <br>lizard</font></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="center" background="http://ao.estoncom.com/images/shanghaiface1.jpg"><font color="#FFFFDD" size="1" face="tempus sans itc">let's not forget...</font><br><a href="http://ao.estoncom.com/profiles/shanghai.html"><font color="#FFCC22" face="tempus sans itc" size="3">Shanghai</font></a><br><br><font color="#44CC44" face="tempus sans itc" size="2">GRASS <br>HOPPAH<br>of the clan!</font></td></table></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubishoopugget.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bishoopugget</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=57685510&img=5" BORDER=0> at: 8/29/01 12:06:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udreadstar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dreadstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadowed Man</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/29/01 6:52:10 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AO worth playing?</span><hr size=1> <br>
/Is it fun? <br>
<br>
I enjoy it.  I would consider it fun, but I can see how it will end up on a lot of peoples shelves a few months after playing.  I don't think it has the qualities that will make it last.<br>
Who knows once they start the 4 year story, I think they'll have issues with keeping people interested and making the story go along fast enough for people.  I would say almost daily or every few days they will have to move along in the story.  If they expect 1 day a month that they will continue the story line, I think people will get bored and leave...<br>
<br>
/Is the connection speed ok? <br>
So far they've made a huge difference in latency.  I very seldom have problems with time warpping, lag death or any other lag related problems.  Unlike the first month.  I'm not sure how it runs on a modem but its pretty good with a dsl connection<br>
<br>
/Are the bugs being worked out?<br>
<br>
Bugs are getting worked out.  They have the problem where, they patch -&gt; fix -&gt; break something new -&gt; patch fix -&gt; break something old -&gt; patch fix something old but make a new bug.  <br>
They are having problems figuring out how to adjust balance.  But I think that is true with all new games and to some extent ones that have been around for a long time.<br>
Exploits seem to be a big problem too, things like no drop items being traded if you give them in a bag.  Thats actually pretty minor.  IPs are what your skills are based on.  As you level you can put these points into a ton of different skills, which sounds great.  Except they've had a few exploits where you could put these points into skills then /terminate (self kill) and you would get the points back, but you would still have the points in your skills.  <br>
One of the problems seems to be their lack of care that people use these to their advantage, it takes them a long time to correct them so meanwhile people find them and use them for a long time.<br>
There are people quickly getting to level 200 (lvl 60 in eq), this short into its life.<br>
<br>
/What's the jist of the game? <br>
<br>
Right now there isn't much of one, people run around and do missions for experience, loot and credits (money), but they do intend on having a 4 RL year story line. Which should start in the next month or so.  <br>
Clans, Neutrals, and Omni are your choices for which side you want to be on.<br>
There is limited pvp, in zones where you can attack other people.  Once the story line starts my understanding is that it will open up more zones to pvp.<br>
<br>
/Do you have groups like EQ does and exp done the same way?<br>
Kind of...  You can group up to 6 people, there is an experience benefit, and the longer your group is together the more of a benefit you get.  The only problem is, each class can solo for the most part.  Everyone can heal to lower the amount of downtime anyway.  I've only grouped once, when I was level 10ish which was okay.  But it was shortly after it went live and it was so plagued with lag issues.  You had a tendency to loose a group member and spend 5-10 minutes trying to hook up with them again.<br>
<br>
/Do you have levels?<br>
1 - 200<br>
<br>
/Is there a monitary system?<br>
Credits, money is actually pretty easy to come by.  And is somewhat useful, theres machines that you can buy items from.  Items that are low level up to pretty high end stuff.  Which is kind of nice, if you want to just dredge through a ton of levels to get enough money to buy the item you want.<br>
My understanding is, that you can only buy items up to a certain Quality level (150) before you have buy these items from trades people.  There are quite a few different flavors of armor, and then theres higher quality armor of that armor.  AO is an endless loop of upgrading and upgrading.  Your armor really only lasts about 5-10 levels before you need to upgrade to a higher QL item. <br>
Unlike in EQ if you had saved up a ton of cash to get a higher end weapon, a level 10 could use it and be amazing from 10+.  AO stuff is based on your skills, so you really can't twink.<br>
Theres no uber items, no boss monsters/npcs.<br>
<br>
/What's the most fun class to play? Bearucrat or Agent look the best to me.<br>
<br>
Hard to say.  I've only played a fixer, which I found pretty fun.  But he's a cookie cutter of a lot of the other classes.  From what I read the Bearucrat is very weak.  Agents are pretty nasty for the snipering.  Adventurers seem to be the jack of all trades. Unlike &quot;Jack of all trades masters of none&quot;, they actually do everything pretty well.<br>
Doctors are about the only class people go out of their way to find...  <br>
But to be honest, I'm not sure which would be a lot of fun, I guess I would do the adventurer or doctor.  But thats only due to my limited reading of the message boards.<br>
<br>
Its hard to say if its worth while trying.  <br>
<br>
I think people have a certain comfort with how EQ is played and it makes it tough for AO to fit what they expect.  <br>
Right now as it sits it's a pretty good 1 player game.  If you expect to meet up with people, group and fight.  I think you'll be even more dissapointed.<br>
I would say, wait another month or two.  Buy it but only pay monthly.  Maybe buy the 3 monther if you are willing to roll with some punches...<br>

That company is so @#%$ up they have zero clue what is going on.  This game cannot last with their current way of doing things.<br>
<br>
To put something into perspective for EQers recently Funcom made a &quot;balance&quot; change to the Adventurer class (two months after release, like they could not have spotted this in beta, oh that is right we are still in beta).  Basically they changed a skill from blue (takes many IP points to raise, you get IP points each time you level then spend them on skills to raise them) to aqua (takes a lot less IP points to raise).  However they did not refund the IP points to adventurers in the difference of the skill cost.  Some like me could start over and have over two levels worth of IP points more than I currently have.  But since I have already invested so much time in the character I am not going to restart and will probably end up quitting the crappy game anyhow.  They have stated that they WILL NOT refund the IP points because they veiw the amount lost as trivial and do not consider the issue a big deal.<br>
<br>
Funcom can go to hell, do no buy this game you will kick yourself for doing it. <p><img src=http://home.orst.edu/~garstin/anarchyonline/signature.jpg alt=Uberdar></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udreadstar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dreadstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadowed Man</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/30/01 5:26:19 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AO worth playing?</span><hr size=1> heh and yet they let the exploiters run free.  Thats what drives me up the wall...  I can see refunding the ips that you used.   Class-A breed-A starts with 100 in a skill points in the skill   Now the person has 200 in the skill.  Just give them the freakin 100 points back to redistribute.  I can only minorly see Funcoms side.  Everytime they make changes it allows players to correct possible errors in their placement of ips.  Big-Whoopie-ding...<br>
<br>
But the soldiers that used that reflect shield (Kind of like damage shields except, say I hit you for 10 hps of damage you actually only take like 3 and the other 7 actually goes back and hits me so I take the damage.  People were going against very high level mobs using doctors to keep their health up and they would get insane amounts of experience per kill)  ran wild for many many days/weeks getting levels apon levels.  And they have yet to address these people.  Supposally they are banning these folks.  But I doubt it...<br>
