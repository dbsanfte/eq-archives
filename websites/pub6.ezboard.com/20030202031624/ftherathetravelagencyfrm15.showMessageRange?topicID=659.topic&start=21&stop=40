Scenario 1: A new cleric joined a guild and jumped into the ragefire camp ahead of the other cleric that had been with the guild for a year, which way do you think things would go?<br>
<br>
<br>
I would hope that the cleric who had been sitting there for the last 5 weeks or however long that terrible camp is would get the items to complete thier epic...<br>
<br>
If they didnt why should they sit there and camp it?  I can say this; if the guild I was in &quot;new or not&quot; didnt back me up after I sat in Skyfire for however long it takes for Rage to spawn then I would not be in that guild for long.<br>

<br>
I never said spotting it made it his loot BUT as i said if member X is looking for help to kill a mob he has been after by camping/searching by himself and he asked for a lil help (I'd hope tindi doesnt need entire guild involvment to kill this gimp ass mob) then imo it should be his.<br>
<br>
So in theory what you are saying is if tindi have zero interest in the mob or loots from the mob and a member does and he goes through the trouble of tracking this mob down by parking his own mule there to check it daily and the loot from the mob turns into a guild decession he shouldnt be pissed?<br>
<br>
well the way we work here in sot is /guild hey guys my mob is up can i get a lil help killin it?<br>
<br>
and from there whoever wants to help goes and whoever doest dont and in 95+ % of the time we help that member with the mob he needs. <p><img src=http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/mestre/Aiyanna.jpg Width=310 height=180></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubogfatherbellybarsh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 590<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/30/02 2:26:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/other_stfuget.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tindi Losi I'm sad</span><hr size=1> Imagine, if you will Zewt  - <br>

And, because your guild decides you're not worthy of getting the item you have put so much time into, you're left with 3 months wasted.  How would you feel?

Why didn't you say (as it's quite obvious he's been doing this for some time) &quot;you sure you wanna camp that bro?

<br>
First off, just wanted to say I'm sad to see both Wilo and Phytir go.  I haven't been able to log on lately, so I wasn't there when it happened.  Just wanted to say you two were decent folks and wish you the best in whatever may happen.<br>
<br>
In defense of Tindi and Zewt who seems to be taking it for the guild, I would have to say although the action taken might not of seemed fair or just to some, I do feel like the proper measures were taken when deciding on who gets the item in question (in this case, the willsapper).<br>
<br>
For those that do not know what the willsapper is, it's a 1hs weap that has a slow componant that is a nice item for warriors to have because of the taunt factor.  For such an item, getting one isn't so much an improvement on some warrior's gear (as there are other weaps out there that may be better, but I'm not a warrior so don't hold me to that), but rather it is an improvement on the guild's gear as a whole.  You see, the sapper to TL is considered a guild gear that increases the chances of the guild's success.  Because of this, the sapper was probably awarded to whom the guild believed would be likely to use it.<br>
<br>
Again, I haven't been on in a week or so and wasn't there during the even that sturred this commotion.  I do feel for Phytir, I really do.  He was a good player and a good person.  However, I haven't seen him or Wilo(another good player/person) on during required guild raids or required guild events in a LONG time.  TL has a database that keeps a very detailed account of everyone's attendence information as well as the loots they were awarded thanks to Zewt.  To my understanding, Phytir's rating probably wasn't up to par with some others, which resulted in the sapper being awarded to someone else.  The people in charge of awarding loots are given access to everyone's attendence records and they base their decisions on the numbers.  They go by the numbers, period.  Unfortunately for Phytir, the numbers didn't work out in his favor.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to make it clear that there was no favoritism being played because the numbers don't play favorites.  I'm really sorry for your decision Phytir and Wilo.  I regarded you both as valued members of the guild, and wish you all the best in whatever you will do. <br>
<br>

<br>
I'll tell you something that's not in those Raid Attendence numbers Tinde keeps so miticulously: Loyalty. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Loyalty is reflected in many ways you don't count:<br>
<br>
-&gt; The number of times they helped other members with difficult corpse retrievals;<br>
-&gt; The number of times they ported guild-members to all ends of Norrath;<br>
-&gt; The number of times they rezed guild-members;<br>
-&gt; The number of times they helped non-guild members and raised the stature of the guild;<br>
-&gt; The number of times they just helped out a guild party because additional muscle or mana was needed;<br>
-&gt; The number of items they gave to lower level guild-members just to help them along;<br>
-&gt; The number of hours Power Leveling or just protecting other guild members;<br>
-&gt; The time they spent improving their trade skills so they could make things for the guild;<br>
-&gt; The number of times they spent comforting guild members going through rough times in game or in life;<br>
<br>
To many, these things are more important than Raids.  These are the things that make a guild a guild, and not a loot mill.<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening<br>

<br>
If that is 90% of what you do in the game, then you really don't need a guild.<br>
<br>
If you aren't doing those things on a regular basis, then you are probably aren't social enough to be in a guild.<br>
<br>
Speaking as a guild leader, when someone starts recounting all the plat they have spent on new recruits, donations to the guild, rezzes, ports etc... I tell them to reevaluate the game.<br>
My suggestion stop keeping a tally on good samaritan acts. If you expect to be repaid for being kind, you are being kind for the wrong reasons.<br>
<br>
If you are camping something you can't possibly solo or do with a small group of friends, then you probably need to not waste your time or speak with your GL before you start the project.<br>

<br>
Wilo has painted a picture here that doesn't really represent everything that was going on. He logs on for the first time in a couple of months and starts accusing our webmaster (who I might say does a phenomenal job) of not sharing his intellectual property of his coding of our database system. After starting an argument in guildsay at the same time as the DN raid, Wilo then told one of our guildleaders to STFU over guildsay.<br>
<br>
Anyway, you people can continue to flame away here. I really don't care.<br>

Honestly, those of use in raid intensive guilds know that the willsapper is a huge weapon for agro. I procs consistently more than even some SoL weapons. I would say that we had 10  toons camped in DN all which are logged on daily and sometimes hourly to check if Vaniki is up. <br>
<br>
This weapon always has and always will go to main tanks, to hold them over until an enraging blow weapon is awarded to them. Every one of Tindi's MT's has had this weapon and probably will going forward at some point.<br>
<br>
The facts that we all don't have here is raid attendance once again, as it was in the case with Bogarrtt. As we probably all remember, Bogarrtts raid attendance was a woping 18%. Keep that in mind when I drop the next fact on you. Phytir's raid attendance was a 17%. Yes 77 out of 441 raids to be exact. Phytir was also lvl 57 where the person awarded was 60. Lastly the person awarded is part of our Graveyard @#%$, and is the MT for that crew. And nothing against Phytir, but he just didn't log on enough to warrant being awarded this weapon. <br>
<br>
Now that the facts have been truly shown, I think it makes allot more sense, as well as proves this to be the right decision. I hold no hard feelings and wished they would reconsider.<br>
<br>
Lets recap:<br>
<br>
- There are at least 10 toons camped in DN watching for him.<br>
- Any time this weapon has ever been awarded, it has gone to a MT (as long as I have been in Tindi anyway)<br>
- Phytir happened to be the one to find Vaniki up. If he hadn't, I am guessing someone else in our guild would have shortly after.<br>
<br>
In looking back at the events, I believe if we had discussed not awarding this weapon to phytir immediately when he announced it was up things probably would have went smoother. Unfortunately, (from what I gather, I wasn't online except for the very end) the guild leaders on at the time were not aware Phytir thought he was going to be automatically awarded the loot because he found the mob up. That has never been the case before, and most likely never will be.<br>
<br>
I hope this clears things up, and I am sure there will still be some critics out there. Just keep this in mind....  Every decision pisses at least one person off. How would the other 4 warriors that were there (all lvl 60) have felt if we gave a superior agro weapon to a lvl 57 warrior that is a part time player? I think we would have made more than one person upset.<br>
