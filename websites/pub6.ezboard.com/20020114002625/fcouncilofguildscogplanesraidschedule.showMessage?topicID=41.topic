Everyone worked well, and assisted the main tank efficiently.  We did a very impressive battle that even some of my advisors said couldn't be done (three gorgons and a WW).  When our enchanter stated he couldn't mez them, the tanks switch nicely to the new targets and we had zero casaulities.  A very impressive battle.  Most importantly everyone worked as a team, which is the key to success in the planes.<br>
<br>
After a bulk of the people left later that night, we did some reverse kiting which worked really well again.  I would hear the words, &quot;TARGET ON&quot;, &quot;DISPELL&quot;, &quot;SNARED&quot;, then the creature was feared.  It was performed perfectly.<br>
<br>
We cleared out about 70 to 80% of the zone.<br>
<br>
Beaniegal did a lot of pulling that night, and although somewhat a new puller there did an excellent job.  And help out a great deal with Corpse Recovery.  I want to thank Allied Giant who came out to assist when the heard we was having a rough start.<br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the raid wasn't perfect.  I was very disappointed as roughly 14 people did not show up that signed up for the event.  I had to re-assign all the groups, which delayed breakin about an hour and a half.  Plus I had to contact backup people and request they show up, and wait for all the backup people to get TPs there.<br>
Then we had a stretch of bad luck, the wanderers new the area tend to be random spawns, and we had alot of scarelings in the area, which seems to have argoed about 20 creatures because of there placement everytime a group came in (was very frustrating to see the huge number of deaths).<br>
<br>
About the only mistakes really made during this raid was alot of people went North East instead of going mostly east on a slightly northward path.  You want to run east, keeping the bridge on your right.  You will encounter less creatures running by the fire.  Also if you die next to the fire, corpse recovery is really easy.  Otherwise, you end up dying in the middle of all the creatures making it extremely difficult for us monks to get your body.  Corpse recovery took several hours, and some bodies where too old be raised.<br>
<br>
If you get a chance, pull up a map of POF, identify the bridge, fire wall, and north camp.  You should run straight to the fire, keeping the bridge about 20 yards to your right (or farther depending on creatures present) then take the left at the fire.  Get this mental map in your head for the next raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As promised I got Gorgons this time, and a few fingers, however we didn't get all the gorgons and fingers.  Maybe next time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Great job to Zellex on last minute reorganization. Took a bit of time but was neccesary in order to get the job done.<br>

Read the policy message, and look at some of the other message you will notice that you basically sign up when I or someone else posts when there's going to be a raid.  My raids are done on a first come first serve basis up to 40 people, any people after 40 get priority for the next plane raid.<br>
<br>
Avenging Crusaders also leads raid under the direction of Jzonn, Ikada (and one other, I forget the name). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uycorerixle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ycorerixle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/16/00 3:29:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoF recap for October 13th</span><hr size=1> Well, I was there on time at 4:45pm, but due to people being late we werent ready to break for at least  two hours after that.  Probably a good thing too, since just as our group was about to zone in I went LD and couldn't log in for the rest of the night. I shudder at the thought of having to log into Fear the next day alone *shudder*. I have a DSL connection and the service went down, and I spent the next few hours trying to install my dusty old 56k modem to no avail. My apologies to Dynne, Spera, and a few other that were in my group and probably had to camp/regroup as a result.  In any case, I'm glad it went well and 'grats to those who won stuff!<br>
