<br>
Interesting pair of quotes. Let's try looking at it in another light: So what if Clan X lost it and starting ranting and showed no respect or courtesy to us... the fact that we had taken a camp they had called but not actually moved into and left standing for an hour gives them some righteous priority to flame us without fear of the loss of respect they'll get in our eyes for their indecency? Could that, perhaps, have contributed to the degineration of events? A lack of courtesy in /ooc?<br>
<br>
I'm glad Rixma is finally off flaming Xedd and LOM as a whole, because they never were at fault. The leadership certainly was involved throughout the entire process - I am part of it. I'll respect a camp that's occupied, but it is a waste of resources to call a camp and then sit around at zone in for an hour. Next time you want the east wing and call it, be sure to actually enter it.<br>
<br>
Am I being a little hard on Clan X? Yes. Flaming someone is not the way to earn their respect. Crying about a camp you left untended for over an hour is also not a way to earn their respect. I'd rather respect Clan X than be disgusted with their attitude and lack of courtesy. I don't appreciate being called &quot;loot whore, all you care about loot&quot; by people who want me to move so they can have the loot that, as of yet, they have not worked for - just dawdled at zone in. The hypocrisy and small mindedness of this approach irritates me. I'm not a mean guy, I think my record pretty much clearly states that. But coming to the RTA and flaming me after flaming me in game and in tells for taking a camp you never occupied strikes me as ludicrous, and I'd like to keep the record set straight.<br>

<br>
See the purple arrow that leads to the east wing? That's the one way dropoff. Clan X never passed that point as a group - Rixma did sneak/hide through it to the exit at the far end at the beginning. See the four sets of two blue spawns around the entrance? Those are all pyre golems. That screenshot was taking at zone in.<br>
<br>
Using SOE, it is possible to get up to the east ledge without taking the long way - going through south. That's what Sulp did with his twobox Druid. Then they sat there. We took the long way, passed them and actually entered East Wing.<br>
<br>
Hope that clears up your faction hit question.<br>

I believe there was a lack on both sides:<br>
<br>
Clan X in claiming the East Wing (and at best making a token effort to support the claim) is asking LOM to be considerate and leave the camp alone until the rest of the Clan X force arrives to start working the camp completely.  The LOM group moves past these waiting folks, and are perceived as 'greedy' and 'inconsiderate' for not respecting the Clan X claim.<br>
<br>
There is another side to this humanity:<br>
<br>
LOM sees a group arrive early to claim a camp they are not capable (or not intending) to do on their own.  Clan X says the people that remained COULD HAVE done east wing alone.  The fact remains that they DID NOT, and were waiting for greater forces.  This 'prime' camp is going un-used, or minimally, extremely under used, for an extended time.  This is perceived as 'greedy' and thus 'inconsiderate' by the LOM group.<br>
<br>
Neither group acted without fault. So what we are being asked to weigh is &quot;Who is more wrong?&quot;  Yes, that is certainly humanity at work.<br>

I was on my way to HS when all this nonsense started. Had I known that a Camp Check didn't mean anything anymore I would have went to Seb and started overtaking camps that people were claiming at the zone in. But PLAY NICE PLOICY seems to be a sticking point to that as is my lack of being an ass.<br>
For all you out there who CLAIM to be a NON-Loot Whore and then try to rectify your complete lack of respect for anyone else by using GREED as your excuse, (there are more of you out there beyond the LOM wall I am sure) please.....knock it off. If this applies to you then recognize it and change it. If you read that and it pisses you off....then TAG....you're it. Realize you are GREEDY and except is as Gordon Gecko did in &quot;Wallstreet&quot;.<br>
<br>
Use whatever claim you want to make the situation fit into your role of what is right Ssarvhok. I will remember it in the future when our paths meet again. Flat out greed is all that was and ever will be. Go ahead....post up again &quot;You didn't have the force&quot;...&quot;Clan X was sitting at the zone in&quot;....use whatever excuses you want to make yourself feel better. We had me and Slink on our way. I have dealt with the LOM &quot;NON-LOOT WHORE&quot; claim before in Trak's Teeth the week before they took the rings out of the skele camp. You guys held that camp non stop for almost 5 straight days and I sat there on countless occasions waiting to claim a spot when someone dropped but low and behold when someone had to leave another LOM member came in to take the place. I am sure you weren't there Ssarvhok so go ahead and play innocnet_victim_001 in that game too. You say not to hold your guild responsible but to hold YOU responsible. Well, to me.....you win as a team, you lose as a team. Your Guild Leader left the decision up to you...you made your choice and here we are. So, much like a snake....where the head goes, so goes the body.<br>
<br>
I am sick to death of fighting for camps in this game. Someone calls a camp, to me that's more than enough. I don't sit here and get into symantics over &quot;do they have enough people to hold camp?&quot;, &quot;they have people on their way but they aren't hear now so too bad, so sad&quot;....I realize we all want the best of what the game has to offer and that OTHER PEOPLE may be after the same mob as me. Some poeple call it Civility. Contrary to what some may think, there are people on the other side of the screens. PLease consider that the next time your need for greed gets the better of you.<br>

What the hell difference does it make if someone is two or three boxing?  Your comment about Sulp/Vort seemed strange. Does that make a person better because they can play two at once, or worse? /shrug.  Please clarify, and then say the same thing to all the Bots and countless others who have multiple accounts. <br>
<br>
I have four accounts and play multiple toons at once, just because its fun.  I pay my money to play and don't use it to any particular advantage or disadvantage.  Most of the raids and groups I go on I am MT or GL or something, so two and three boxing is out of the question.  I use it as most people would, to help with pickups and possibly fill in a gap if there is a class missing on a small raid.  <br>
<br>
Please don't feel sorry for Clan X.  That's the last thing I want from a person like yourself.  <br>
<br>
I want to revisit the &quot;proud&quot; statement.  In the publishing world, most people would consider an article or post on a message board as non-fiction.  So when you say &quot;I wasn't proud of what I did&quot;, that means that you are basically saying &quot;I was being an ass.&quot;  Is there another way we should take that, or are you speaking some other form of English.<br>
<br>
If you are writing fiction then please throw out a disclaimer, or try putting it in a book.    <br>
<br>
Now, I'm not defending Clan X or LoM.  I'm just looking at what you wrote and thinking that I'm glad I'm not in a guild with you.  <p>Glanois Zonyx <BR>

Hail, Shei and the hatred people had for him.  SoT as a guild would be flamed for anything like this, but since Xedd is sooooo fucking cool, its not fair game.  This kind of shit has been happening for a while on this message board.<br>
(And i'm not justifying all the shit SoT took for petty shit from the same people who months before had done something similiar *cough*)<br>
<br>
On another note: <br>
<br>
My opinion..if play nice is nullified by one person or a group of people, the deity PvP server rules come into effect.  Eye for an eye is my opinion...If this means you need to train them, have fun.  Besides, whats the chances of getting caught since there are never GMs present anyways.  <br>

<br>
While I am sure you had to wait like everyone else did, monoploizing it for 5 days is just a prime example of my point. And while I was not the only one waiting at that camp, (I made a few nice friends from Clan Bashemded and &quot;the now defunct&quot; SoT due to the assinine way LoM handled that camp) it just goes to show that there are some who still do not grasp the concept that others pay their money to play this game too. If you want to defend your guild for this....be my guest, it will only further illustrate my point. Do I hate every guild before you who camped the rings ??? I guess I do if they handled it like LoM did in this case. So, if you have any facts to back up your claim than by all means....post them, or shut the hell up. I am sick of people using other guilds as their scapegoat for their own lack of class. Any other matters concerning this, take it up with me in game.....I am not hard to find and I can break out 5 other people who waited like I did in LoM's wake.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you have to take a step back, breath, and take a look from an outside perspective. While I am not saying we did everything perfect in the HS ordeal, I am just pointing out an obvious problem with the system in general. The actions by LoM in this case meerly stand as a clear example of what I despise in this game....the unadulterated use of GREED as a reason to run roughshod over anyone in your path. If you want something and someone else is there, use whatever means bexxessary to achieve your goal. Common curtesy and decency get thrown out the window when it comes to LOOT. And if you are defending that then more power to you Donte. I need not go any further in trying to figure you out.....it is plain and clear. <br>
<br>
As far as 2-boxing....what the hell does that have to do with anything?? I am not sure what your implications were to this Donte but I really couldn't give a rats ass. Sure, I 2-box from time to time just as a lot of people do. Paladin/Shaman combo works well fyi. If you need any other 2-box suggestions I have a list that I can pass onto you if it will aid you. <br>

<br>
1) Clan X called a camp they never took<br>
2) An hour later, LOM took it, with Rixma still in Chardok<br>
3) Clan X flamed us in tells, ooc, and now here on the board<br>
<br>
Yes, I have a second machine and second account, my point with the two-box is that it was one person left &quot;camping&quot; an entire wing that he hadn't actually set foot in with either of his toons. *shrug* You can camp library from outside Disco for an hour in Seb, or Cappy from zone-in in Karnors, or Village from Fake Wall in velks... yes, &quot;camp&quot; it with 2 toons for an hour and see how long your camp gets respected. In any normal exp zone, I think you'd get a lot less consideration than AN HOUR. HS is becoming a normal XP zone, I've seen 35 people and all wings camped before.<br>
<br>
As for the GREED statement, I'll reiterate: It's hypocritical to call GREED and LOOT WHORE when you want someone to move so you can have the loot yourself. Are you saying you're a better person because you wanted the loot first? *laugh* Rixma checked and didn't see Drusella. Maybe she surmised that it might still repop, like I had. But, then, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> she left</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. South wing is better loot and much more trivial pulls, if all Clan X had been after was a decent camp then there you have it. No, their GREED made them cry foul... and as I have said over and over, had they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> actually stepped into the East Wing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I would have respected them calling it their camp an hour before. But they didn't.<br>
<br>
As for LOM monopolizing a camp (shrug the rings that drop from it were subpar for my class so I didn't pay much attention) all I know is that we had to wait in line at one point till EOTF got 6 rings... and we had ten LOM in line after them, some needing more than one ring, but all waiting there.  You know, that whole &quot;putting effort in&quot; thing... waiting patiently on a list instead of showing up and screaming &quot;FOUL!&quot; because the list is too long. Doesn't sound like a monopoly situation to me. *shrug*<br>

Did you talk to your guildies about them flaming other people in zone. You say your not taking sides obviously you are.=)<br>
<br>
This is the way I see it. I'm a druid lets say I waltz into CS and no one is camping otters I claim chief but I dont actively engage chief because I'm waiting for an enchie to come c3 me. Lets also say that instead I pull the lesser otters that are around the chief camp. And finally lets say that this has been going on for an hour. <br>
<br>
Hun if you claim a camp as a druid you better be actively pulling. Sure you can go afk for ten maybe even twenty minutes but if your gone an hr and another druid is waiting on camp an your not making any effort then your camp is forfeit.<br>
<br>
Now that is from a druids perspective. Which is somewhat like yours but not totally. As people have said countless of times in this thread  LoM was not illegal in there movement to take camp. But on the other hand they disregarded the play nice policies. <br>
<br>
From my point of view I see two guilds neither right nor wrong. Through miscommunication this flame thread which could've been settled in /tells wondered its way to the FC. Who is more right and who is more wrong. NO ONE. Both parties have good arguements.<br>

<br>
Is it hypocritical to call someone hypocritical while claiming they did what you had done? I believe they asked nobody to move, but stated they were there first. If I'm not mistaken, LoM was the one wanting Clan X out of the way to get at Drusella. Even after LoM was corrected in thinking Clan X was going to west wing, you pushed through South and, as stated in a previous post, planned to get into a position to kill Drusella if Clan X had not. The term &quot;vulture&quot; comes to mind and, yes, I believe that hovering over another group waiting for them to falter to sweep up the loot could be termed as &quot;greedy.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Are you saying you're a better person because you wanted the loot first?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I believe it's not because they wanted the loot first, but because they were not the ones to leapfrog a claimed camp and stated that none in Clan X would remain guilded if they did such a thing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> South wing is better loot and much more trivial pulls, if all Clan X had been after was a decent camp then there you have it.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
They stated they were after Drusella, as well. Better loot is in the eye of the beholder, one could charge your group with the same statement. If all they were after was a decent camp and not Drusella I'm sure they would have allowed you to proceed or even have changed wings. They were there to check for Drusella and found her not up, but hope remained that she might spawn soon with the server repop so they were going to stay there and clear the wing while they waited.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> No, their GREED made them cry foul... </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, I mean, what filty jerks for being mad at someone on leapfrogging a camp and trying to justify actions for which he is already not proud of doing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> and as I have said over and over, had they actually stepped into the East Wing I would have respected them calling it their camp an hour before. But they didn't.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This ties nicely back into the original topic of the thread, the common courtesy. <br>
<br>
Rixma, Sulpicious, and Vortigern called the camp. Rixma was asked to help with something or other in Chardok (rogues move slowly, 40 minutes would not be uncommon for a round trip with a stop in Chardok--not to mention getting back down the canyon and into H.S.) and she ran over there to do that as quickly as she could while the other few members of the group were afk and Sulpicious was busying himself killing some in the wing.<br>
<br>
Typically when one calls a camp, one thinks that it's fairly secure from invasions on this server. Rixma probably thought she'd get done helping someone quick-like (she has a horrid sense of time) and pop back into H.S. and join Sulpicious. If she were lucky then perhaps the rest of the group would have joined him already and she could just catch up, no worries. She rarely thinks she's a pivotal part of anything so she flits around.<br>
<br>
Sulpicious probably could have gone on into the &quot;prime&quot; camp,&quot; as it's been put, and started killing there but, darn his greedy hide, he was going to wait for his friends to join him in the fun so he killed some wanderers and a few static mobs near the beginning of the camp.<br>
<br>
Maybe we hold higher standards for consideration of people and tolerance in my guild, but unless those people at the camp left or actively relinquished the camp to me somehow, I simply would have acknowledged their intent on the camp as they stated--without having to see for myself or time their performance--and moved on to do something else instead of hovering around them to swoop in if they messed up. <p><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/d20/gneiss/gneiss.txt"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvittorriod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VittorrioD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/30/02 1:49:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=746.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Rixma</span><hr size=1> Rixy, Sulp, Vort.<br>

As far as this post goes I can say that regardless of what was said, provided as fact, screenshoted etc.  They pretty much admitted in their posts that yes it was legal and no they werent proud of it.  So I think they made your point for you.  Anyway next time send me a tell.  Prenerf CoS + Harmshield + FD = problem solved *chuckle*  I wouldn't be proud after using that formula, but hey it's legal if I am just trying to get to another part of the zone and people are in my way right?<br>

<br>
LoM zones in and sees Clan X claim camp but may or may not have enough people for the job.  &quot;Ok Clan X, you have an hour to get the people here and enter East.  If not we will move in.&quot; <br>
<br>
Would that of been ok?  I think it would be for me.<br>
<br>
I know and have grouped with people from both the involved groups and believe this is more verants fault for making the damn spawns, not just drusilla, every spawn in the game too fucking rare.  If they would catch a clue verant would see that people dont like to sit watching their screens for hours/days on end waiting for freaking mobs.  This is what Verant calls a quest though, a quest to see how braindead stupid people are to sit and take it *slap* sorry..almost went past the point of no return there. Anyway,<br>
