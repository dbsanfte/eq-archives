We had fun even though we didn't manage to kill her.  We were smacked down pretty hard, but we did manage to get all the corpses, save one (Quies).  We'll be trying to get his out tonight.<br>
<br>
I think the tactic I have are sound, but we basically had a glitch with the execution.  I'll be poking around to get a better feel for the timing in there.  I'll also get some info on what we can do to move Vox back to her normal spot (or close to it) if she happens to move up close to the entrance area.<br>
<br>
I know we had enough people there to accomplish the task.  I just need to work on refining the plan.  Thanks to everyone for their patience in accomplishing what we did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usteelheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Steelheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(9/21/00 11:03:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Recap (Sept 20)</span><hr size=1> Just to add to Jzonn's post (Good cop, bad cop post. &lt;snicker&gt;)<br>
<br>
First I would really like to apologize greatly for my stupidity last night. Here is a list of stupid things I did (don't worry will list other peoples stupid things to. &lt;LOL&gt;)<br>
<br>
First Before I ran to Vox's lair with all you in tow. I should have explained what the hell we where doing and how the hell we where getting there. <br>
<br>
Two I should have waited longer at the rock door so everyone could find it. I thought everyone was with me but later I heard there was some ghosting problems<br>
<br>
And last &lt;Slap my forehead&gt; I should have never sit in Vox's lair to apply my poison. The handful of people that made it with me into her lair didn't even know what hit them. I should have shouted a charge or something.<br>
<br>
Again I apologize for my stupidity.<br>
<br>
Other peoples stupidity. <br>
<br>
Please for the Love of some god, when the person running the event or someone helping him or her says something, do it. I don't care if you think you are a super tank or something. There is a really good reason they ask you to move. Let's take the priest for an example. Come on people how many times did he pop into the roof because you guys wouldn't pull him into the room and keep fighting him by the rocks. That aggroed things in Vox's lair and people found themselves summoned in Vox's lair.<br>
<br>
Please do not enter Vox's lair when people are doing Corpse Retrievals, as much as help would be great it can also be our bane. I'll explain a little of how Vox sees things. Vox can see throw everything, all invis, camos, and lastly hide. Yes Vox can see even rogues when they are hidden. The reasons Rogues can pull in Vox's Liar is because of sneak. Sneak lowers Aggro radius of monsters as long as we are not in line of sense. If anyone enters Vox's lair she turns around and heads for them. That usually means the rogue is between you and Vox. (Not a fun place to be I can tell you that.) So don't I repeat don't go into Vox's lair until someone says you can (that's during CR time).<br>
<br>
I think that's it for the stupidity. &lt;Grin&gt; Now some not stupidity stuff.<br>
<br>
Although we had some minor problem will CR, I think it went smooth and like a well oiled machine a huge thanks goes out to Blinken for getting all the corpses out of the pits. It would have costed me basically as may people as there are in there in deaths to get them all out. (There are some Icy Terrors on the top of the drop off in Vox's lair they can see through hide, when they aggro so does Vox. Blinken was level 57 and when she got aggroed she got TPed to zone. (Lived to pull another corpse out of the pit.) Blinken if you read this. Thanks again.)<br>
<br>
I think for a first run we did good, not great but good. I don't think any group like ours has ever pull off a Dragon raid in the first time. I think we learned a huge amount for this all and I know that next raid we will do a lot better. <br>

I have been asked many of times what class I am. Well that is easy.<BR>
<I>"I am <B>Rogue</B>: Adventurer, Explorer, Adrenal junky, Gambler, Scout, Puller, Fame seeker, Gypsy, Rake, Jack-of-all-trades, Assassin, Lock smith, and Story teller but I am not a Thief! Well not always."</I>

There were bound to be glitches on the first raid of this type, and I think it is as much of a success for actually having happened as it would be had Vox been killed. It shows that with the help of people who volunteer themselves to organize an event like this, the Council can pull off some amazing things. I'd like to know about how many guilds were represented there (I know my two members, Becle and Kordail were there and loved it) and what the general consensus on the raid was, for fun factor especially. <br>
<br>
Thanks to Jzonn for putting this together and to all who attended.<br>
