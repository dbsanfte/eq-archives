Why didn't you take it upon yourself to tell your own fucking group and ask your group to move?  Instead, you had to be a cock sucker about it.  It's that kind of attitude that got you the reputation you have from the level of 30ish all the way up to your super UBER, *da best shaman in the game*, ass.  I can remember hearing shit in guild chat about you well before you ever got into LoM and the day you got into LoM, I laughed my ass off.  I was surprised they ever took a classless asshole like yourself.  Hell,  you were ONE of the reasons when I looked at returning to the game and disbanded my old guild that I looked right past LoM.  <br>
<br>
Notouchie, you try to come up with excuses for your behavior, yet your attempts are futile.  Most of the people on the server have known about you, and most try to avoid you.  Hell, even your own guild members avoid your shit at times.  Maybe it's time that you start respecting others on the server and they might be able to respect you.  Else, you and Kindaaf can get together and make a groups and condone each others intentional training on innocent players.  <br>
<br>
It's too bad I don't play anymore, because I sure would have a fun time running around and choo chooing your ass to see how it feels like corpse running.   At least you give people real reasons to wanting to train your classless, maggot infested,  *Hi my name is Stanley, welcome to my tool shop*, ass.<br>

<br>
No.  The first time i told you it, it was my camp while you were standing there alone, you told me to shut the fuck up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Secondly I didn't walk up to you, I walked up to you and my group who was waiting for me there.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, it was just you, your group came later.<br>
<br>
&quot;While we were killing the mob we pulled, someone ran out of inner with a one mob train so we yanked it off him to help him out. While we were killing the 2 mobs you wined in say &quot; Will you please leave my camp &quot; 5 6 times while we were just killing the 2 mobs&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, first off, you dont go taking someone elses mobs and expect them NOT to bitch.  And second, I believe what i was trying to get that you JUST proved was that i was being very nice about it, i didnt tell you to fuck off, or to get the fuck out of my camp, or t to go find a different spot, I nicely asked you to leave and you acted like a total dick back to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Our group pulled **1** mob and we proceeded to killing it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know why you specified one, but to make sure you get it, I will capitalize the part in my Quote.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to bore you with the crap that doesn't matter, I woke up early and Outer wasn't camped so I took it. About 30 minutes later Notouchie comes up and just PULLED SOMETHING from my camp without asking or anything.<br>
<br>
Never said you were pulling a bunch, I said something.<br>
<br>
&quot;I then hit my wrong hotkey and I broke mez, trying to get the mob off the chanter they accused me of KSing, I thought nothing of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok that was bad grammar.  it should have been &quot;I then hit my wrong hotkey.  Trying to get the mob off the chanter, they accused me of KSing.  Knowing that I was just trying to help, I thought nothing of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You've stolen mobs from a group at inner cave when I was in them, along with 2 of your own guildies. They said you were a fagget.&quot;<br>
<br>
L.O.L.<br>
I have never had enough time between spawns to get to the inner caves group, and the only time i did was to CR them when they wiped.  That is false, and i find you lacking on trying to cover yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thenotouchy>TheNotouchy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/7/02 2:03:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Notouchie and Tallaared</span><hr size=1> &quot;I then hit my wrong hotkey and i broke mez, trying to get the mob off the chanter they accused me of KSing, i thought nothing of it.

<br>
Bad grammar? How can hitting innate cammo get a mob off our enchanter? You're a poor liar, and yup, you're a dick even to guildies from what Anian's told me when we were grouped with 2 of your guildies that were equally annoyed as hell... he would know since he's read your guild chat being in tindi.<br>
<br>
And again, You're not one of drama shit&quot; but you flame me for being in a group that kills one mob in your camp and my guild leader is afk when you msg him? Flaming me for training would obviously be stupid as I called the train.<br>
<br>
Lukieb asked why did you not take it upon yourself to get your group to move or something to that effect. We did, if you'd please read my initial response it says we took one mob from the camp ( then moved ). It says I'd just gotten there and didn't know what was going on..I'm not going to tell a new group to leave their rightful camp as I enter it when I don't what's going on, and as far as I knew, it might have been their camp. I don't remember ever having problems with you Luk. The only thing I recall about you is you asking me to duel you when I was lv39 and you were in the 50 52 area. That was over a year ago, you sure do hold grudges well. I don't remember anything else, then again I don't go out of my way to hold grudges nor like holding them. As far as what your guild chat says, have you seen any of that from your experience or are you just hearing your ideas from others and believing it. <br>

<br>
Klutz I am sorry but making a blanket statement about a guild tag seems to come more out of ignorance then out of fact.  If you have an issue with one person don't blame the tag.  I love how everyone loves to dogpile on flames like this thinking they are holier then though.  Some have come here with well thought out grievances, while others just come here to act like ignorant, immature children who have nothing better to do with their time.<br>
<br>
As for my guild members actions...they will be dealt with internally by us, not by a lynch mob of people from the server.  You have your options of dealing with it if you choose not to come to the leadership.  If you so choose to use them so be it.<br>

I tried to contact the LoM leadership to deal with the problems and pretty much got the online version of whats happening here on the boards. So of course nothing was done. And thus we take matters into our own hands..<br>
<br>
Now Notouchie, if your reading this you know I owe you a train of considerable size. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This is a future apology to anyone that happens to be near Notouchie when I decide to return the favor.<br>

To Notouchie and the Leadership of LoM: If something happens every now and then, it can be written off as a bad day, accident, etc. If Notouchie trains people and acts like a dick so often that you have created a section on your forum for people to complain about him, THAT is a chronic problem. Should we tell you how to run your guild? No. Can we express our opinions about how much of a dick he apparently is? Yes. I realize this is a game, but let's put it in a real world spin for a moment. You're the boss of a company. Your company has interactions with other companies on a day to day basis. Not competitors per se, just normal personal interaction. You receive multiple complaints from persons working at these other companies that one of your employees is rude and it's pissing people off. How long would you tolerate this behavior from an employee? Even if he were your number one salesman? You're probably gonna say 'Well, I would talk to him about it and find out what his intentions were, and give him the benefit of the doubt'. Or something of the ilk. Bullshit. You'd fire him because he's making your company look bad. Well, it appears as though that is what Notouchie is doing to your guild. Making it look bad. A lot of people are going to go away from this thread with a bad taste in their mouth where LoM is concerned. If that's fine with you, good for ya. I've always said that people shouldn't give a damn what other people think. Just don't come back in two months when LoM needs support from someone else and you don't get it and bitch about people. If you want to play the part of the ass, you have to play it during the good times and the bad. <br>
<br>
Apparently, Notouchie must be a really kick ass player for you guys to put up with this much shit from him. There will come a time though, when you have to decide if he is a good enough player to fuck your guild's rep to stand behind him or not. This may be that time, and may not be, who knows. Looks like you guys have already made a few enemies because of this post.<br>
<br>
I would guess there's some stretching of the truth going on on both sides. But, with Notouchie's reputation for being a prick to people, the population is naturally going to side with Corso. No suprise there. I'll reserve my opinion of Notouchie until when and if I talk to him in person. I'm not going to go out of my way to find him, but should we cross paths I may throw a 'Fuck You' his way to see how he responds. Apparently a lot of people think he's an asshole. Maybe we'll get along.<br>
<br>
To Kindaaf: This is a flame board. What the fuck do you expect people to do here, discuss world fucking peace? 'Running to your mommy'? Grow up. And no, we have had no interaction in game that I'm aware of. That's not going to stop me from flaming you here though. See the above info about this being a flame board. <p><img ALIGN="middle" SRC="http://www.techcentury.com/home/ceredwen/ceredwen.jpg">Ceredwen Aog'Lostey, Wizard of Archons Guild, Rathe Server, Member of The Cabal(tm)!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grifka>Grifka</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/7/02 6:16:03 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.thegeekhost.com/bsohl/images/grifka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: glugg</span><hr size=1> Imma only gonna say that no where did the original person who posted say that he was upset/mad/annoyed/anything about bein' trained.

When I joined LoM a dozen people warned me about how much he is a dick.  I was very wary but they are wrong.  He is not the most congenial guy by any stretch of the imagination but he is a great friend.  He is the rare kind of person that will do ANYTHING and EVERYTHING in his power to help out a friend at ANYTIME.  I'm not talking about coming to buff you when you are three zones away or stuff like that I mean the guy will camp something for 16 straight hours just to help you with a quest.  The reason his friends come to defend him so fiercely is because he deserves nothing less and would do the same for us. <br>
<br>
I think it's obvious that Notouchie needs to make an effort to control his pulls more but the guy is not a train machine like people make it sound.  The difference is attitude.  If he trains the zoneout  and calls it (he does 99.97% of the time which is better than 99.93% of the server) and you are camping the zoneline and then die he is not gonna be apologetic like most of us would, he'll most likely tell you its part of the game and get over it.  The ironic thing is he is right, even if its not the most congenial attittude.  Training is a part of the game and all you can do is try and avoid causing them as well as making sure you call them.  I'd like to hear from anyone that has never caused a train; sorry, but shit happens. <br>
<br>
I am not an officer nor do I speak for Notouchie or the guild but I have complete confidence in the leadership taking appropriate actions WHEN it is necessary.  My personal opinion is that if my brother is in trouble I don't turn my back on him, that is when he needs me the most.  We are a family in LoM and although I don't like everyone I seriously doubt there is another guild with so many fantastic people in it.  I chose this guild for a reason and if you don't think your guild is the best one (not uburest) then you probably shouldn't be in it. <br>
<br>
Oh, and for the record (no offense to Salelann, Anaskesia or Elenrak) Notouchie is hands down the best Shaman I have ever witnessed on the Rathe, probably the best player period.  How you like them apples. <br>
<br>
PS.  Tallaared can be a grumpy butthead but most of the time he is a funny mofo.  Just make sure he doesn't run out of weed.  He is also a good person to try and emulate if you play an SK.  Only thing he doesn't know about the class is...Troll &gt; all.<br>

Try reading a bit more, i said my Innate camo was NEXT to my Nuke key.<br>

Besides that, you are all missing my point except for Grifka, i dont care that he trained me, as i stated in my first post that wasnt why i was angry.  He was acting like a total asshole to me while i was trying to be civil and keeping my cool.<br>
