<br>
Last time we saw a post like this you about started a war on the server.<br>
<br>
Please before anyone gets carried away could we please hear from KEG FoR BOTS, and I think MFH maybe too. Even if you have voted on the other string, please vote here again. We need some clarification.<br>
<br>
There are 5 things to vote on. Yes or no.<br>
<br>
Ciw had said nay to the proposal, so now they are saying not nay to the whole thing but<br>
<br>
1) no to 36  min<br>
<br>
2) yes abolishing the 2/3 rule and to be able to invite all the guests you want but only 6 from any one guild<br>
<br>
3) I assume plane of sky is ok then? yay or nay please?<br>
<br>
4) Epic guilds the way it standsIs ok the way it stands and by saying epic loot the BB guilds do not want any other loot yes?<br>
<br>
5) Training days??? was that a yes or  a no?<br>
<br>
<br>
Once again, please try to refrain from posting until we get some feedback from the other three guilds involved.<br>
<br>
We can not keep changing these proposals or this will never work. Lets get this into place what we agree on and go from there.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW and this is just a rumor but one I'd like to share. I heard that one of the BB guilds got Cazic 4 times last week. If this is true then I would have to conclude that even the *ubbers* did not consider the big brother rules in place yet.<br>
<br>
BTW 2. Inny popped on BOH late hate raid and I personally contacted BOTH KEG and BOTS and no one seemed very interested. Granted none of the names that came up when I did a /who BB seemed familiar but I did not know who exactly to contact. How can anyone else know?<br>

It is grossly obvious you people don't know wtf you are doing here anymore. FIRST OF ALL. Big brother guild is horseshit. Say for example some kayans cant kill a god, and usually they cant without some help. Well then they can call in a single guild each time ignoring the other ones. IE everyones big brother guild could be keg and everytime kayans cant kill GOD they call in KEG, so BOTS and CLAM can't get any gods via big brother system. ALSO big brother system is based off trust in the smaller guilds which lets face it has been established to be absolutely negligable. Second of all there are a bunch of people who feel like planes are theirs whenever and they just go in and do whatever they feel whenever. This is an obvious problem and one that you CANNOT solve period. Why do you keep ignoring this? Dare I call you people oblivious to the obvious problems? <br>
<br>
Also I haven't seen a single gd plane in like 2+ weeks, a god in more than that. Mebbe you folks don't realize that we can kill Queen in chardok rather handily but cannot manage to get any maestro hands and yet you morons just let maestro rot in hate every day cause it doesn't matter to you. Why in the world do I sit here day after day and put up with such jerkish efforts by people who just try and hold other people back. We are whole heartidly nice, you don't see BOTS jumping your raids, and yet, you just can't seem to muster up any decency to help us complete quests you cannot complete. I JUST DON'T GET IT. How can people call us jerks when day after day you let the major mobs we just wanna snag quest items off go to rot? I AM SO sick and tired of this horseshit. Now we got some half wit people trying to run this gd system like they know jack shit. HEY WHOEVER IS RUNNING THIS GD THING YOU AINT CUT OUT FOR IT ANYMORE THE BOARD ISNT CUT OUT FOR IT ANYMORE TAKE A HIKE GET A LIFE AT GTFO.<br>

I agree.<br>
<br>
I think the proposal as it stands is 95% of the way there.<br>
<br>
Would you and the other people who have done the work up until now be willing to have another chat/IRC for a set amount of time, with moderated discussion (to prevent terminal spamming) of the issues, and then have everyone agree on this board ahead of time that the decision reached by THAT group is final for the next 6 months, with a review at that time in similar fashion at that time?<br>

Such as nuking someoens quest mobs as they are handing stuff in, training people just because they have a guild tag, not to mention certain confrontations in the planes, that is unfortunate yes, but not completely other peoples fault that it is viewed in a bad light, it was in fact BAD for them to do.  Contact a BoTs officer when one of their people are beeing an asshole oftentimes nothing gets done about it or you get laughed at.<br>

but any way... I digeress.<br>

Judging people by there tag is idiotic any way, and uncalled for.<br>
<br>
The new cal is almost set up, much of the stuff has been agreed to or shot down.  It seems some efforts were made to reach guilds that could have come up to do the gods, but they didn't take action.  CIW killed him tonight I beilve, so this particular debate is over.<br>
<br>
If you want to show intrest in taking down a god contact the people there, I remember when Cazic was holding my Dawnfire, Mills was sending me tells every 15 minutes or so asking if we needed help.  :-P<br>
<br>
That was several months ago, we didn't need help, but someone had contacted us and we knew where we could get help if we needed it.<br>
<br>
so untill the actual cal is set up just talk to people, communications are key. <p>Zachton Soulstriker <br>55 Templar of Karana <br> Xach Soulstriker <br> 25 Ranger of Karana <br> Zachrot <br> 18 Paladin of Brell <br> Master of life for Requiem of Souls of the Rathe.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umarcys.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marcys</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/14/00 4:05:41 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/marky_harlock/images/smmarcys.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sirth sneaks into Hate </span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;BTW and this is just a rumor but one I'd like to share.

One of the things i do, when i hear a rumor is go straight to the source.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nov 7, Falcon star had fear, 1-2 groups of KEG members assisted them clearing the plane, and they allowed us to Loot the Shissar Head.<br>
<br>
Nov 8, There was a server crash in the early morning? I dont remember the exact specfics, i know the server went down, and fear was popped by the gms.  THIS WAS OUR CALENDAR DAY<br>
<br>
On both days there was no epic quest items off cazic.<br>
<br>
As far as i know, no new system has been agreed on, has it?<br>
So until then.. STFU... and agree to a system and implement it.<br>
<br>
BTW, for those that cant count, we got 2 shissar heads(epic quest items), not 4 CT's.<br>

<br>
The differences between your last proposal is extra days for &quot;ubers&quot; and 4 people needed to post?  And this is enough of a difference to just give up on the Calendar?<br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned you can have the extra day.  But when do we draw the line?  When half of the posting parties are BB guilds?  When a third of them are?<br>
<br>
Hell, if we look at Rewena's list it looks like anyone that wants it will already be able to get 2 days in a plane per month (just not in a row). <p>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

<br>
I am breaking my last post statement to add this comment...<br>
<br>
The reason why there have been very few BotS postings and/or comments on the proposals is that we are tired of this committee procedure.  We posted what we thought was a reasonable solution.  It is being nit-picked to death.  I will be quite frank in the discussion following.<br>
<br>
Point #1:  The solution to having more days *for everyone* is to reduce the number of posting entities, thus freeing up days.  Find a way to do this.<br>
<br>
a) One way is to up the number of people required to become a posting entity.  This forces alliances, thus cutting down the number of posting entities.<br>
b) Simply say that there is a hard limit (X) number posting entities, first come first served to become a posting entity.  Basically this says that some groups are just SOL unless they form an alliance with a posting entity.  This option probably won't fly.<br>
<br>
Point #2:  The solution to the epic quests is to provide a way for those who need the items to get the items. For some reason, people think they have *rights* in this game or *deserve* something in this game.  I do not believe anyone has *rights* in this game farther than what Verant enforces (the PnP, for instance among other policies) and especially that no one *deserves* anything and have posted many times about this.  People say that I did something and that I am disrupting their fun and they pay $10 too.  To those people, I say that I pay my $10 and *they* are disrupting my fun.  Which one of us is right?  Two options considered here.<br>
a)  FFA - this does not mean kill stealing, training, etc.  However, it also does not mean that the first group to the plane owns the plane.  It means that &quot;ownership&quot; is on a per-mob basis.  This allows potentially many groups in the planes at once.  The first one to engage a mob &quot;owns&quot; it.  It was thought that this wouldn't fly.<br>
b)  &quot;Big Brothers&quot; - this would allow, although still at a greatly reduced rate - larger groups/guilds to get the quest items.  Have no doubt, that the rate would be higher than a strict calendar system.  The failing of this is what was termed &quot;illusions of grandeur&quot;.  People will loot the quest items &quot;dreaming&quot; that they will be able to complete the epic quest &quot;some&quot; time and will eventually quit the game before they finish the quest or it will take months for them to finish.  People say that they have a &quot;right&quot; to do this but, in effect, they are hindering other people who have exactly as much &quot;right&quot; to enjoy the game as they do.  This seemed like it would be more palatable.<br>
<br>
Tiring of writing about this here and I need to get back to work...<br>
<br>
Point #3:  Still along the issue of epic quests, the aim is to let larger groups/guilds have a better chance at getting a quest mob spawn.  The timings are regular, barring server reboots.<br>
a)  Put quest mob spawns on a rotation system.  This opens the door of who all gets to be in the rotation.  See Point #2, option b.<br>
b)  Give more posting days so that these groups can try to schedule them.  This is more like the lottery since you have to schedule in advance but it at least gives a chance.  This was thought to be more palatable.<br>
<br>
<br>
I will now once again go into lurker mode about this whole issue.  I don't even know if there is currently a calendar even in existance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usheltim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sheltim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/14/00 7:45:22 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/jdelan/eq/sheltimmsgbd.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   One I don't want to see...</span><hr size=1> I understand why you want a higher number of planesable toons. It makes sense BUT with the Higher number needed it forces alliances which then forces more people to be there in a raid which forces lots of problems with lag, LD and communication.<br>
<br>
Coming from a VERY small Guild I will need an alliance with another Guild to even think of going to the planes or an invite. That I have no problem with but when you force alliances with people then those alliances force out the invites you might have gotten. <br>
<br>
Being only lvl 47 I have never been to the planes and one day I hope to, but if we go on the present course of FFA I really don't see that happening cause we all know that once that happens it's gonna be farm city for guild members 24/7. It will no long be Hate or Fear but InnyGuk and CTGuk. <br>
<br>
The Planes are a GREAT place to teach Tactics used in later raids somewhere else. It's also a great place to teach Tactics for alliances between 2-3-4 or more Groups. I would hate to see these areas go FFA due to the Greed of a few people. <br>
<br>
Well, at least if it's FFA I can wander in there and not worry about dying cause everything will be dead already...I guess that is an upside, Right? <p><body>

Just because you can complete the quest does not mean Verant gives you the &quot;right&quot; to do so.<br>
<br>
I personally however feel that the items SHOULD go to people that can complete the quest.  And I agree fully with the BB rotation.  Hell, I think pretty much everyone is in agreement with that now.  <br>
<br>
The only disagreements between the 2 proposals seems to be:<br>
a) 36 or 40 people to post.  WTF!  Its 4 people!  Just decide on one number and use it.<br>
<br>
b) Extra days for BB guild, if there is room on the calendar.  I don't really see why this needs to be a rule, if there are dates open after the first raid, post for a second as always.  And eventually, not that far off I think, there will be alot of entities that meet the BB requirement.<br>
<br>
c) The new proposal added &quot;training days&quot;.  I don't see this as a bad thing, but if this is the rule that is holding back the &quot;ubers&quot; from supporting the proposal then cut the rule!<br>
<br>
So, as far as I can see, there are 3 small differences between the proposals.  Not enough to fight about in my opinion.  Lets just take one proposal (or a merging of the two) and move forward.  People will continue to abuse the old system because of the current chaos and no one is monitoring things.<br>
<br>
So make one set of rules and get the calendar going! <p>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

(I say guilds which encompasses guilds and alliances.)  But my question to them is, why should they get those extra days?  There are guilds/alliances out there that have 70+ toons as well.  If we are to make an exception for them, just because they can clear Isle 6, that is totally wronging those others.  From what I understand, they have mostly completed their planar armor.  Why do they need more days?  So that there's a better chance at epic loot?  That is why I proposed the training days.<br>
<br>
If they want more days, then there should be some sort of system like x number gets x days, so that it is more fair to all the guilds/alliances.  However, the whole purpose of revamping the minimum to post was to have a faster turn around, and something like this would put us right back where we were. <p><B><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#ffffff">Edwina Nytengayle<BR>

<br>
Make the minimum 38(compromise).<br>
<br>
Big brother gets 1st choice at extra days by their epic rotation. When BB gets a extra day(optional), he will move to the back of epic list. If they don't want extra day, they will not lose place in line.<br>
<br>
If the younger guilds dont ask for help and leave a god up, they should lose a day in the future. This will insure that they follow procedure.<br>
<br>
To make this work we will have to follow strict procedure on the Big Brother epic quest issue.<br>
<br>
This may appease all of us, if so lets get it approved. <br>
