<br>
Oh, and since I have been quoted, then I won't feel bad about quoting Vince...<br>
<br>
&quot;We are not all uber, let them have their try, they have been down there for 2 hours&quot;.  (or something very close to that.. I am at work, so don't have log infront of me).  Why the sudden change of song Vince?  <br>
<br>
Also, I would like to point out that on the night in question a FFA was declared due to patch (you know, the usual check with guild on rotation if they are going to attempt their mobs FFA), so the reason that NB has been using for getting upset as &quot;that being the only mob that they were up for&quot; is not entirely true.  They could have attempted any other mob that was up that night (checking with rotation guild first of course).  To the best of my knowledge this was not done.<br>
<br>
Whether we stalled or not at this point in time should be irrelevant.  What is relevant is that we had 41 FK in the zone (a number certainly enough for an attempt) vs 2 people from NB, that we announced that we would like to try the mob, were supported by RTA community, and all of that was still challenged by Karadin, which led to the incident.  <br>
<br>
I have had a chat with Karadin about some things last night... Some things were worked out, some things were not talked about, and some things we disagreed on.  However FK believes that we were wronged in this particular instance.<br>
<br>
Btw, I am looking forward to more comments from NB members with IQ less then 86 (a number that came up when I did /ran 100 last night.  Personally from the comments that I have seen I feel the number should have been lower), however do them on your own thread.  If you don't have anything relevant to say, stay out of this thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/15/03 11:03:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=104>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FFA</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you don't have anything relevant to say, stay out of this thread. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

My guild is very small, we have at max 20 people that are 50+, and about 4 or 5 people under lvl 50.  But, we have a lot of friends that are in different guilds.  And it's a lot of friends from a lot of different guilds.  So we are forced to lower content rotations cause we can't bring our friends along, yet with our friends we can kill harder mobs than some of the rotation mobs we can't kill.  We aren't going to mass recruit a bunch of people we don't know.  If we group with someone and is unguilded and we get to know the person, we will then invite them to join our chat channel, so more of us can get to know them better, and then we'll ask them if they would like to join us.<br>
<br>
I mean hell, we can kill gore with no deaths and about 20 people, we can do ToV - HoT with 1 group and no deaths, but most the people used are not in our guild.  <br>
<br>
FFA doesn't really bother me, and anyone that believes, PoF, PoH, and PoA will be cleared all day everyday are being stupid.  Look how often those planes are reserved period during the week.  Spending 20 hours in PoH to clear the whole plane to hand in a shitload of armor to PoK guys for exp is stupid, if that is what you would rather do than say goto Kael and farm Thurgadin quest armor, your priorites are kind of out of whack.  But do what you wanna do.  Personally if mobs went FFA or Rotations allowed you to bring friends from other guilds, my guilds sights would be set more on Statue, AoW, Ssra named etc.  Not stuff like Tunare where you spend 12 hours clearing the plane to kill one mob that drops decent loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadynstormsurge>shadynstormsurge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/15/03 12:06:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FFA</span><hr size=1> If you need an alliance with another guild to get on rotations, Form one.

You with a bunch of your friends is just that, you didn't kill it. How is that to be classified? Will your friends always be raiding with you? Sounds like they might as well join your guild.<br>

If you had been down there for 2 hours why wasn't he dead then?<br>
<br>
There are 3 reasons to kill TMs ont he day G/E/C is due:<br>
1).  To trigger the spawn.<br>
2).  You don't know any better.<br>
3).  To delay another guild from being able to trigger the spawn.<br>
<br>
You apperantly were not trying to trigger the spawn if you are getting wiped out to AE pulls from the mines.  You can't claim you didn't know any better when Tindi has just bitched at you the day before for doing the same exact thing.<br>
<br>
Which leaves #3.<br>
<br>
You knew you didn't have the people to kill glyphed and/or Exiled and so you killed the triggers so that NB could not take thier turn.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Whether we stalled or not at this point in time should be irrelevant.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I do not find it irrelevant.  You purposefully blew the spawn so that you could buy your guild more time to get people there.<br>

Join an alliance or make an alliance:<br>
You honestly think it's that easy?  Just make an alliance?  Too many guilds had bad experiences in the past and generally base all their future decisions on alliances from that one bad one.  We had the same problems, and still we try and get alliances.  It doesn't happen overnight though, in the process of talking with Far Seekers now, which is where a majority of our friends are.  They had bad experiences before, and are shady on alliances, so not even sure if this will work out either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=abazagaroth>Abazagaroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/15/03 12:44:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=110>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.modernhumanorigins.com/images/webring.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FFA</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Milambus... then I assume you also have it in your logs that we requested to do G/E well before Karadin logged on, and had the support of everyone in RTA at that point in time?

<br>
So what? Karadin speaks for his guild, who cares if &quot;everyone in RTA&quot; supported you trying the cycle? You get on a rot by racing a guild or asking them for permission to try on their turn so you don't have to race them, the guilds on rotation make that rotation's rules, the RTA just administers the databases and lists those rules. The fact that &quot;the RTA&quot; or even members of the guild in question &quot;agreed&quot; you could have a chance is besides the point if those that talk for the guild doesn't want to give you a chance. Blowing the cycle to stall for time because you are worried that another guild can bring in their raid force before you can finish getting your people in there in time is pretty weak. Might as well claim a &quot;camp&quot; in some zone where mobs will kill each other or where there are guards that will kill the mob, and just train the camped spawns to get killed for a few hours while you wait for your group to show up, while telling everyone else in the zone that spot is &quot;camped&quot;. That's about the same level of underhandedness.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We did kill your TM's to stall, call it frustration.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That pretty much says it all doesn't it? You stalled the ability of another guild to kill a mob on rotation, in order to give yourself a better chance of getting the kill (probably hoping the other guild ran off to do something else). That's a form of cockblocking, and is pure bullshit. If you think some guild is full of assholes or doesn't want you to progress or doesn't even want to give you a chance, then race them. Don't use a shit tactic because you think you're gonna lose a race.<br>

<br>
1. Coming here and insulting NB as a guild by stating our IQ's are below 86 isnt going to win you any friends, isnt impressive, not clever and sure as fuck dont make you look 'hard'. Its almost on par with the 'My dads bigger than your dad' age old phrase.<br>
<br>
2. Less gimping on RTA more mobilizing your guild and actually going for a mob, quoting that FFA BS is pretty stupid, and makes you sound like a Qwai baby. You think everytime we wanna go for a new mob we ask all the other guilds for our support ?? Like fuck, we just smoke the mob and move onto the next one, less whining more action, or in the immortal words of Elvis *A little less conversation a little more action please*. <br>
<br>
3. All i see when i read your post is *Whine whine we cant kill X mob whine cry whine* No ones holding you back, fuck dude NB is the latest raiding guild in EQ, we raid so late our euro players are actually getting up to goto work. Anyone that cant race us and have a good chance at beating us with mobilization to a mob is pretty fubar.<br>
<br>
4. Less veiled hatred, ignorance and general stupidity pls, we dont make general accusations about FK members all thick as pigshit etc, its common decency to not tar everyone with the same brush, you probably even have friends in NB... wait scratch that, you probably HAD friends in NB. Less being a dickcheese goblin in general.<br>
<br>
Ok im an asshole, illiterate, inbred, poor white trash yada yada yada, i can see all the insults coming now, end of the day, NB wasnt the guild crying on the RTA and getting *support* /chuckle at that one, cos we wanted a shot at a mob, do or do not there is no try as a small ugly mofakka once said. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 830<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/15/03 2:32:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fere</span><hr size=1> I am pretty sure the 86 IQ was in response to Darkoak's little crack, not NB in general.

The RTA doesn’t decide who gets to try NB’s mobs.  NB decides if we are willing to step aside or not.  We will never back off a mob that someone attempts to cockblock us on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also, I would like to point out that on the night in question a FFA was declared due to patch (you know, the usual check with guild on rotation if they are going to attempt their mobs FFA), so the reason that NB has been using for getting upset as &quot;that being the only mob that they were up for&quot; is not entirely true. They could have attempted any other mob that was up that night (checking with rotation guild first of course). To the best of my knowledge this was not done.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, the RTA does not decide if NB is FFAing our mobs due to a patch or not, NB does.  Did you learn nothing from the KT incident?  You ask the guild in question if they are FFAing, you don’t tell them they are.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Whether we stalled or not at this point in time should be irrelevant. What is relevant is that we had 41 FK in the zone (a number certainly enough for an attempt) vs 2 people from NB, that we announced that we would like to try the mob, were supported by RTA community, and all of that was still challenged by Karadin, which led to the incident. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not only is your stalling relevant, it is the ONLY relevant fact.  You chose to race us and stall us to boot, then you get a race.  Congrats, you got 41 people there first - now pull or we will.  Once you wipe to either Exiled or Cursed, we will make sure you don't blow Cursed on a patch night.  That is what a race looks like when you wanna play hardball and cockblock.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have had a chat with Karadin about some things last night...

<br>
That is not how I would describe our conversation last night.  It was certainly more amicable than you describe, and than is presented here on the boards.  Thank you for that conversation, it is definitely a move in the right direction.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Btw, I am looking forward to more comments from NB members with IQ less then 86 (a number that came up when I did /ran 100 last night.

If you don't have anything relevant to say, stay out of this thread.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree, anyone, NB or FK, who is posting nothing but stupid insults at one another should move to another thread.  I would think that would include comments about the IQ levels of other people.  Posting an insulting request to move insults to another thread is like trying to put out fire with gasoline.<br>

Look how often those planes are reserved period during the week. Spending 20 hours in PoH to clear the whole plane to hand in a shitload of armor to PoK guys for exp is stupid, if that is what you would rather do than say goto Kael and farm Thurgadin quest armor, your priorites are kind of out of whack. But do what you wanna do. Personally if mobs went FFA or Rotations allowed you to bring friends from other guilds, my guilds sights would be set more on Statue, AoW, Ssra named etc. Not stuff like Tunare where you spend 12 hours clearing the plane to kill one mob that drops decent loot. [/quote]<br>
<br>
My guild/alliance is also not very big.  We do have the bodies to attempt some of these rot mobs within the alliance, but getting everyone to show to do some of these functions is not always feasible.  We are lucky to get 30 people to show for Hate or Fear.  We might get bigger numbers if we planned on going into harder zones.  We have a raid planned in a few months go to into ToV.  Hopefully we will get good representation.<br>
<br>
As for PoA, PoH, PoS and these other lower level zones going FFA and thinking that they will not be cleared all day every day, you are probably right, but when most of the people in my guild have work/lives outside of EQ during the week and sometimes the Weekend, so we cannot gather the strength to go to these zones for 6, 7, 8 hours on Weeknights.  Our best chances are on the Weekends.  Would you think that these zones would be available to us with full spawns if it were not for the Calendar or the Rotation system?  I highly doubt it.<br>
<br>
It really doesn't bother me that most of the items that drop in these zones are more Rot stuff than anything else and most times we turn these items in for Exp/Gems.  But there are times when we have new guild members or people who bring alts up that we outfit them with items.<br>
<br>
Sure there's better stuff out there that, as individuals or small groups, we may be able to gather it.  But there are those of us who do not have the means and these other zones give us the chance to improve our equipment.  The Calendar/Rotation system gives us the opportunity to KNOW that at least some or all of the mobs will be up when we go there.  We would be the only Guild/Alliance in PoA/PoF/PoH and would not have to fight any other guilds/groups for the mobs/drops.<br>

I got this drift from my conversation from you in-game too, and from that one jackass who posted and got his flame removed, we did manage to snag a copy of what he said before it got nuked...  Suddenly it is not Glyphed/Exiled, it is the Cursed cycle, is it?<br>
<br>
Please correct me if I am wrong, but was NB's first Cursed kill not more than a couple months ago?  Yet you have been on G/E since at least September, which is as far back as our Rotation site goes apparently.  For a guild who spent at least a couple months on just the GLYPHED/EXILED rotation, you guys are quick to forget your past and package it all into one big threesome kill.  At best you attempted Cursed every time you did the cycle and lost, which would still be &quot;blowing&quot; the spawn.  Which is also a misnomer because you can get to the cursed spawn just find after killing the pseudo glyph/exiled replacements.<br>
<br>
You know better than I do that there is more than a small order of mangnitude difficulty from Exiled to Cursed.  So if FK is trying to get on the Glyphed/Exiled rotation, as you did months ago, why the hell are you talking to us about how we are or aren't ready for Cursed?  How quickly you seem to forget... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=201&stop=208>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=981.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=981.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=120><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=981.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=981.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> -
