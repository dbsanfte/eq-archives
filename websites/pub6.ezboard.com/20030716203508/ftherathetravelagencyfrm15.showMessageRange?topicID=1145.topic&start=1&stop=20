<br>
I'm in the Army and proud of it...so I took immediate offence to someone trying to pull something like that. At first I thought it may just be a private trying to pull something...but as the conversation progressed it became obvious that he was a total moron. Below is the log from the conversation...<br>

Brazzous tells you, 'Have a nice day'<br>
<br>
<br>
The last 2 tells from him I missed in my logs...turned them off too soon...but that’s a direct quote of what he said to me. It's pretty obvious that he was lying and just trying to scam people.<br>
<br>
Just some general info<br>
O3 is an officer Captain with between 5-10 years in<br>
04 is an officer Major with between 7-14 years in<br>
A Sergeant Major(which is what he claims to be) is an enlisted(E9) with 17+ years in service.<br>
<br>
He reminded me of those post 9/11 scammers….just sad pathetic people<br>
<br>
Point of the story...watch out for guys like this.<br>

Oh, this would be so much of an insult to an E9 to lose that much TIS and an insult to the O3 for being referred to as an enlisted individual.  Actually the &quot;Sarg Major&quot; was enough of a clue.  I've seen it Sgt. Maj. or SgtM. but never Sarg Major.  Next time you talk to him ask him what his LES says.  Better yet, what is his MOS.  You're a 74B (ISO-A)?  Boy did he pick the wrong field to say he was in.  I was a 1T251 (AFSC) when I ETSed and a 49151 (Com-Cop-Sys-Op) prior to cross train.<br>
<br>
This is starting to sound like a movie....hmmm<br>
<br>
&quot;Seeing as how the VP is such a VIP,shouldn't we keep the PC on the QT, because if it leaks to the VC, he could end up MIA, and then we'd all be put on KP.&quot;<br>

<br>
 After much thought it was brought to our attention if we dropped something heavy on EVERY squid that was stupid there would be no one left to steer the boat, cook the food, or do the laundry. <br>
<br>
 It was then brought up that if something heavy was dropped RIGHT NEXT to the out  of control brass this might shock them back into proper calibration, if that didn't work ...BONK.<br>
<br>
hope that helps clear it up =)<br>
