So much interest in the pitiful world that is Phainein/Suria and Soreah's life. That after all this time they have to spend this much energy to call names and point fingers, and they can't even get that right.<br>
<br>
As Poppa's RL wife, I have been here from the beginning, and I know what's been going on. And all of this is just making me laugh.<br>
<br>
(I don't have any phone bills to wave around to prove that you called us... phone bills don't work that way, kids... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So your phone bills must show when YOU called us, huh?

<br>
All I need to say is that if there were anything really worth defending against in your ridiculous rants, anything that mattered, maybe we'd use the energy to point-by-point take you down. But anyone with a modicum of knowledge, and even a scrap of common sense, can tell where the stench comes from. And dearies, it started in Springfield.<br>

After all, as his wife you HAVE to suck his @#%$.<br>
<br>
My phone bills don't have a single call to anyone in the western half the country. Period. For as long as I have had a phone.<br>
<br>
I have a 40 page logfile that I have kept dating from the day Poppa pulled a bunch of bull on me, showing the real story of what happened. The people I sent it to agreed with me via email, and then openly support Poppa, so the treachery is not his own.<br>
<br>
Murc, Lorenzo trained Jessamyn without me telling him to. The day I left CoS (LEFT, was not KICKED OUT) I did everything Poppa asked me to via tells, and still he decided to blame it on me. The only thing I admit to doing wrong was saying, in guildchat, that Jessamyn was dissing CoS, because you know, that's guildstrife.<br>
<br>
I did tell Lorenzo to knock of his tricks, he didn't listen. This was the same Lorenzo that trained Soreah's Nagafen raid back when Poppa adored Soreah. He was out to make trouble for CoS, but then, you wouldn't know because neither you NOR Poppa at any point in time came into the zone to find out what was going on.<br>
<br>
You'd rather sully the innocent to make yourself look better, like Poppa has done to countless people by his own admission. If the people of CoS would rather live the lies they've been fed than follow the way of truth, so be it. I will no longer try to keep others from being hurt. I'm sorry I tried, but what else is a Paladin to do?<br>

<br>
Im confused! (no suprise)<br>
<br>
In one post Suria says that the real life Soreah is a Navy Seal but later we learn that he is &quot;about to go in the Navy&quot;.<br>
<br>
So, again, the reality does not match the &quot;dramatic creative vision (read as hallucination)&quot; that Suria perceives.  Imagination is good till you start mixxing it up in whats really going on; And, baby oh, baby, is something mixxed up.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Soreah obviously loves Suria.  Can't fault a man for being loyal to his wife... ponder long and hard you two because there is a disturbing and reoccuring pattern going on with your relationships.<br>
<br>
1. Become Soreahs friend<br>
2. Meet Suria<br>
3. Have some good times<br>
4. Say something banal that pisses Suria off<br>
5. Your world is turned upside down till you beg forgiveness repeatedly and admit that every accusation they levy is true and you are sorry that you are such a horrible person.<br>
6. You become their friend again (back to step 3).<br>
<br>
It's the same sort of cycle of abusive/acceptance one sees in families of alcoholics or hostage situations.<br>
<br>
I reflect back to the long diatribes Soreah and Suria used to give about how this friend stole household items from them. How other friends ripped em off and used em and threw them away.  &quot;He doesnt know I know what he did but I KNOW&quot; is an example. They had something to complain about with everyone they knew!  People who I met online and gamed with for months were portrayed as dolts, thieves, cowards, liars or worse.<br>
<br>
First of all I didnt understand why they'd tell me these intimate details of their real life in game. I thought: Maybe they were just going through a hard time.  Pressure has a way of twisting preceptions and reaching out for someone to use as a sounding board.<br>
<br>
I tried to be supportive, hoping the storm would end. I've lived long enough to know better than to get close to people that act like that.  One thing, though, gave me hope that maybe these peeps would be different...<br>
<br>
Soreah, when he sets his mind to something, is a DAMN HARD WORKER.  He has imagination, desire, and determination, a real fire burns in him to accomplish goals.  The sort of person that from the face of it you would be proud to call friend and ally.  The facade drops though... you piss Suria off one little bit and oh my god you see the tirade in the last 5 pages of posts.<br>
<br>
Now they have something to complain about me... still not sure what that complaint is... Somethign about lost trust or being an @#%$ (poppa critical fumbles his charisma roll). But I get to be the latest on the long list of ex-friends that are guilty of a list of nebulous and malicious character flaws.<br>
<br>
Ive halted the cycle I spoke above at step 5.  I made the apollogies appropriate for the insult I inadvertantly levied during our short friendship.  It wasnt enough and well guess what... that all you get... I am not apollogizing anymore.  I dont want to be your friend anylonger I thought that was clear 6 months ago.<br>
<br>
I hope that the Navy is good for Soreah.  Getting out and seeing the world is likely to have boundless &quot;I&quot;-expanding experiences (as Timothy Leary would call them) for him. Having once called him friend, I sincerely wish him the best in his future endeavors and joyous prosperity. (fnord)<br>

Triad, GR, IB and many others. <br>
CoS is full of childen.  And yes, they cant raid for @#%$ with out dying. Hell, half the time you have to beg there lazy arses just to show up for raid.  <br>
<br>
Sorry all but Poppa is a pole smoker and Senial is on the receiving end of it.<br>
<br>
For a guild who wants so bad to be uber.  the only uber thing they are good at is wipe out outs and trash talking down on other guilds.<br>
