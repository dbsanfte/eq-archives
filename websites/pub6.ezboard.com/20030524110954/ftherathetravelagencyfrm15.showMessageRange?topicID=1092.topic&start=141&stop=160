They're had <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>eleven fucking years</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> already.  Eleven years.  Understand this?  Every year for the past 11 years we've asked Iraq, &quot;Are you disarmed yet?&quot; and every single time they've said something to the effect of &quot;None of your fucking business.&quot;  We've had multiple resolutions stating something along the lines of, &quot;If you are not disarmed by such and such a date, we come in, bomb the shit out of you, and disarm you by force.&quot;  Every single one of those dates has come and gone.  Weapons inspecters are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not given the free reign their resolutions grant them, Iraq is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> disarmed, the dates on these resolutions are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> coming and going, Saddam is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in power and his citizens are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dying from starvation, lack of sanitation and running water, and lack of medical attention.  You think we're making progress?  Lemme tell you something- we're not making any more progress through diplomatic means than the English and French made with German's blatent violation of the Treaty of Versailles in 1939. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We have lived with terrorism as a reality for many years. Living close to London I have been involved in a number of evacuations due to IRA bomb threats etc. Our intellegence service's building was subject to a car bomb. Have we gone out there and taken extreme action. No.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Good job.  You resolved a conflict through (mostly) peaceful and diplomatic means.  Have a Nobel Peace Prize or 4, you deserve it.<br>
<br>
You do realize it's taken you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>80 fucking years</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to resolve this right?  80 fucking years!  Your country has had planes blown up over your towns, you've had to deal with bomb threats, you've had busses bombed, you've had your intel buildings bombed because you didn't step in and 'remove' the IRA the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>first</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> time they killed some of your civilians.  The US is not prepared to adopt the &quot;just ignore it and maybe it will go away&quot; stance that Europeans are so fond of taking.  You took it during the 30's with regard to Hitler, you took it in the 40's and 50's with regard to Israel, you took it in the late 80's with regard to Yugoslavia, and now you're taking it again with Iraq.  Given Europe's track record with the &quot;Sit on your ass doing nothing&quot; policy I think anything short of battery acid enema would be an improvement.<br>
<br>
We've had ongoing negotiations with Iraq for over a decade now, frequently interrupted when Iraq stepped back and said, &quot;We don't want to talk to you right now,&quot; and were brought back to the negotiating table by American air-strikes and tomohawk missles.  Fast forward 10 years, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>nothing has changed.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Nothing.  Iraq is still not disarmed, they still have no intention of disarming, and regardless of what you read in your newspapers, we're still no closer to putting an end to this than we were in 1992.  Diplomacy has failed.  We tried, we've been trying for over a decade, and have come up with nothing.  So now we bring in diplomacy's better half and let loose the dogs of war.<br>
<br>
Sitting around talking for another ten, twenty, 80 years won't do anything.  Eventually Saddam is going to realize (my bet is that he already has) that all this talk from France and Germany about inspectors etc is just that- talk- and will never be backed up with anything he's afraid of.  I'm sick of making threats against Iraq.  Threats are meaningless if we're unwilling or unprepared to back them up, and we've spent the past decade proving to the world that our threats are meaningless.  Fuck that.<br>

There you go. If America has waited 11 years surely 45 days (its less than this now in fact as some time has passed) to get the majority of Europe onside and prevent divisions throughout the security council is worth it?<br>

As to progress all I can go on is the reports by Blix that say that they are getting increasingly better co oporation. He is the guy we put in charge of running these inspections. I would have thought his opinions and viewpoints would be worth listening to.<br>

That 45 days of yours is meaningless.<br>
<br>
Second, Iraq has done the &quot;we'll play nice for a while until you forget about us again&quot; routine before, at least 4 times.  You believe they're being sincere this time?  I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.  One definition of insanity is someone who keeps doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and keep expecting a different outcome to occur.<br>
<br>
This whole sick &quot;weapons inspectors&quot; theatrics has been done many times over.  The difference is that Clinton was in power and if Iraq ever got weapons of mass destruction, it wouldn't be while he was president so he didn't care.  Clinton would rather have the &quot;he's the guy who made peace with Saddam&quot; than the &quot;he's the guy who removed Saddam from power and set up a democractic regime&quot; legacy.  Both are noble goals, granted, but Saddam has indicated that peace is not an option he's willing to consider.  If Saddam suddenly turned into a benevolent, caring, loving father type figure who did things like feed his starving citizens or repair his shattered infrastructure using money given to him by the UN and US etc rather than spending it on development of chemical warfare agents, all would be fine and dandy.  But, Saddam is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> one of those people, and his country will remain a third world shithole that happens to have a higher per-capita GNP than many first world nations until he's removed from power.<br>

Great runnnnnnnnnnn onnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn sentenceeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!<br>

I'm glad you believe firmly that our government is so great and that it should be able to flex its muscles with all of its citizens marching along in stride.  What you described above more closely resembles the theory of marxist-communism then anything else.  &quot;A land where everyone is equal and we shut our mouths and do whatever the goverment thinks is right to do.&quot;  <br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, you live in a country ran by principles of democracy alongside an economic hybrid form of capitalism.  The first principle allows us to elect our goverment and alongside of the Constitution, it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>permits</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> us to speak out against our Government.  The second principle, capitalism, is not one which promotes everyone doing well.  For, it promotes people an availability to move up and down through the hierarchy of society, but does not guarantee everyone FOOD, WATER, SHELTER, RUNNING ELECTRICITY, and other luxuries you assumed everyone has.  I believe, you have taken for granted the fact that you have all those and that our government is not perfect and there are things that need to be improved.  <br>
<br>
Get sickened because not everyone agrees with the Govt, but also enjoy the fact that you are overlooking many of the government's flaws at the same time.  Just remember, your outlook on how GWB and the govt is doing might change if you happen to become a victim of our slumping economy and find yourself in a long line towards unemployment.<br>

The .com bubble popped in 2000, when Clinton was president, not Bush, and brought most of the economy with it.  If you ask me, (which I know you aren't, but will tell you anyway) our present economic situation is a result of overspeculation in the marketplace dating back to Amazon.com's IPO.  The US economy was growing too fast in the 90's, and now we're reaping the rewards.<br>
<br>
I'm always up for a little Bush ribbing, and he has many faults, but our economy being shit isn't one of them. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but does not guarantee everyone FOOD, WATER, SHELTER, RUNNING ELECTRICITY, and other luxuries you assumed everyone has.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> The point is, they're available for us, and anyone who makes an active effort to take part in our society can get them.  This is not the case in Iraq, because Saddam is too pre-occupied with building chemical and biological weapons to fix the pipes and the power grid, and sells food to buy more weapons. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I believe, you have taken for granted the fact that you have all those and that our government is not perfect and there are things that need to be improved.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> No, I don't.  I'm very thankful I was born in a country where anyone (yes, anyone) can get their own apartment with running water, if they so desire.  I do not, however, consider them &quot;luxuries&quot; that only the rich western countries can afford. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkoak>DarkOak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Blade</span><br>  Posts: 534<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/16/03 10:16:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1092.topic&index=153>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> propaganda sure has played a large role in this thread. keep thinking the manner in which bush has conducted himself is just, people will wonder what's in the water. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Please explain to me how going to war against a man who is:<br>
<br>
1- Developing biological/chemical/nuclear weapons<br>
2- Shown himself to not care at all about human life<br>
3- Harboring and helping terrorists<br>
4- Expressed in no uncertain terms his hatred for your country<br>
<br>
is not just?<br>
<br>
How long should we give Saddam to disarm before it is &quot;just&quot; to attack?<br>
<br>

<br>
Saddam Insane :P hates america, and all democratic nations or nations that dont believe as he does. He supports terrorists that will blow up a nursery of sick children and say it was in the name of God. He IS in support of terrorists that are trying to obtain nuclear weapons to sneak into U.S., U.K., Canada, Spain, Isreal, and many other nations, so they can slaughter millions of innocent people. He needs to go, no matter how you look at it. The sooner we get him out, the better. The Iraqi people deserve a chance to live their life in safety. Safety from a sick tyrant that will torture their children in front of them. (Yes, he has done that to get information).<br>
<br>
France: They not only have a MUCH larger financial interest in Iraq than the U.S. But the also have had a long standing friendship with Saddam. That friendship is one of arms, nuclear materials, and oil being exchanged. If Saddam goes, so does BILLIONS of dollars that France is owed by Iraq. Do they give a rats ass that he is feeding terrorists with arms and money to kill innocents? Nope, they only want their money, and they dont want anyone finding out about what they have given Iraq. <br>
<br>
Are all the French people like that? Nope. Many have fallen to the propaganda of &quot;U.S. is after the oil!!!&quot; I laugh at that stupidity. <br>
Before you say that the U.S's interest is in oil, do a bit of research. The U.S. has more oil stock piled than any other 3 countries combined. They produce twice as much as is recorded. Much of our oil is stockpiled by the U.S. military in &quot;undisclosed amounts&quot;. Do we need Iraq's oil? Nope. Do we hope to recover it safely? Yep. Why? Because who do you think is going to have to pay to rebuild Iraq? To give the Iraqi people medicine, cloths, food, shelter, and an economic system that will give them a fighting chance? You think France is going to. HELL NO! You think Germany will? DEFINATELY NOT!<br>
<br>
The U.S.A will shoulder about 80% of the financial burden of helping the Iraqi people get what they need. U.K will help out with about 10-12%, and the rest will be split up amoungst a few other nations. The U.S. will have to spend approximately 13 TRILLION dollars in aid and securities for the Iraqi people. Damn straight we will use some OIL to do it with. WTF do you expect?!?! If someone else comes up with another way to make millions of people safe from an insane dictator, free 10's of thousands if not more of oppressed people. Feed, cloth, care for, and make secure these people. And defend it from would be attackers......If you know a better way, then say so. But talking is not solving shit. Saddam is a dictator. He is an evil, evil man that would just torture your children if he though you knew where so much as ONE CIA member was. <br>
<br>
You want peace? Peace only comes when the dictators and tyrants are gone. When the terrorists are defeated. Each one is a step closer to peace. <br>
<br>
As for Korea. Korea does this every 12-15 years. They huff, they puff, then they get a paycheck and go back to life as usual. IF Korea has nukes, they are not dumb enough to use them. IF they have nukes, they dont have the technology for intercontinental ballistic missiles. They want attention. They will get the &quot;aid&quot; they want, and in 15 years, they will do this again. They are a poor nation that cannot afford to feed their people, so they threaten to build nukes to get the food. /shrug. <br>
They are nowhere near the threat that Saddam is. They are not trying to sell this stuff to terrorists that will bring it to New York City, or London, or even Paris, and slaughter millions.......<br>
<br>
As a side note, standing up for what you believe in is a great thing. If you think things in the government is handled wrong, by all means, stand up and voice your opinion. But one thing that kills me, is when people protest the military. Think about that. If not for those people in that uniform, doing what they have to do, you would not have the right to protest........<br>
