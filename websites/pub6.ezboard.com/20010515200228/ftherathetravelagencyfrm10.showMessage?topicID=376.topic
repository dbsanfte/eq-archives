Viceross you said read the rules and if I have any questions contact you so I am. So you just banned us with no reason. If your going to ban us please give the respect of statin exactly why. You said read the rules and I did we didnt break any, the 6 friends rule is for non posting guilds that was established so the only possible thing is calling the BB WHICH WE DID. The whole time factor is a mute point as the hour and 1/2 time may have been short but the zone was 95% clear. Not to mention after the FoR incident I thought it was decided the 5am deadline doesnt even apply if the God is up. ALSO there is no rule other than actually callin in the BB, how you can ban us for not callin in on time boggles me. Please show me the time in the rules, but since we both know its not there the only thing you can possibly show me is the discussion reguarding it where nothing solid came out of it. According to the rules as long as we call in BB we are complying. Im just curious how we are gettin banned for no rules being broken. Once again it seems personal dislike takes priority. I hate to say it but we will most likely be in hate sunday reguardless, we posted fairly and to us didnt break any rules, nor can you even show me in the rules that we did. If you wish to ban us for 30-45 days after Sunday fine, that seems a fair punishment for your personal dislike for us. But I suggest next time you ban someone you at least give the courtesy of the rule they violated.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uelaundarnobillium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elaundar Nobillium</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://home.stny.rr.com/drhager/sword.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Freaks</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>234</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/7/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11:27:46 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: What kind of power trip...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">(I'm an ex-admin - not a current one).<br>
<br>
Dispite Evilrulz tone and attitude, I also would like to know what rule they violated.  The reason I ask this is because they did follow the the letter of the rules:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Guests - You may invite whoever you wish along on your raids, as long as no more than 6 come from the same guild<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> They did violate this by inviting more than 6 from another guild, however, the intent section also says<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  ...What you may NOT do is use your relationship with another posting entity so that you all may go twice per round.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Valiant Knights is not a posting entity, so the intent section seems to allow them.  Also, the official ruling is that &quot;same guild&quot; means same alliance or group.  I believe that WK and SR would be considered a defacto alliance in this case because there was no way to cheat the system (which is the rational for this rule.)<br>
<br>
----<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Reservations - ...The ownership (for lack of a better word) changes from one entity to another at 2 am Pacific Time. Your guild and all their guests are expected to be out of the plane by then. ..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->They did violate this rule as well. However, there is a confilct in the rules: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Epic Guilds(Intent) - DO NOT LEAVE THAT PLANE WITH A GOD UP.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  I have asked for this clarification in the past - is it ok to leave at 2:00 am with the god up, or can you run over to kill the god.  I personally favor the latter within reason, because of the strong text used in the Epic's Guild section.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Epic Guilds - If your group can not clear a plane, the responsibility falls on the reserving entity to get a hold of the Epic guilds. ... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The 10 pm call in rule is not yet offiical.  YES they did violate the communication part of this rule, but it was actually a &quot;suggestion&quot;.  30 minutes is too late to call in the epic guild, but that rule isn't in place at that time (or now infact).<br>
<br>
-----<br>
I am not questioning the decision of the admins, and I agree that they have the final say in the matter; however, based on the fact that I cannot personally see what rule they violated; a clarification of the violation would be in order.  I in no way support Shadow Reapers/Valiant Knights in this matter, but instead I am concerned that without a clear reason for this violation that my guild could also be punished on some future raid.  <br>

Obviously you don't know what the responsibilities of an admin are nor how difficult the job can be. And it's rather obvious you have not read the previous thread concerning the FoR incident.<br>
<br>
Nor have you, even though the opportunity arose several times, made any posts regarding bb guilds on the guild representatives forum. There was no 'agreed' contract formed between the guilds that if a God was up the time would be pushed back. It was still 2am PST. It was also discussed that the call in time would be 10pm PST. Though earlier would, of course, be better. <br>
<br>
PoF was repopped at (what time did you post again?) 10pm EST, and your guild is obviously comprised of mainly eastern players, would it not have been even remotely wise to let the bb guild on rotation know that you may not be able to clear the God (when the plane was finally repopped by the GM)? Which would have alerted them to be on standby, and we probably would not be typing up books here today.<br>
<br>
Personally, I wouldn't mind adding a stipulation for the Gods, but hey then I'd probably be seen as 'power tripping'. Funny how that is.<br>
Of course the requirement would be akin to:<br>
If you have only 6 hours, and the entire plane is repopped including the God/boss mobs you must let the bb guild on rotation know what is going on and keep in communication with them. And like-wise the bb guild should try to do the same. This addition would only apply to guild's/entities that have not cleared / killed a God in 5-6 hours by themselves.<br>
<br>
Too heavy-handed? Perhaps. Perhaps not.<br>
<br>
It'd more than likely cease all of the fictional writing taking place.<br>
<br>

<br>
However after all that has happened with people not calling in BB when they should, this should never of happened.  The way i see it, by not respecting the fact that BoTS was the BB guild and was not giving any advanced warning and was called with the 2 am rule lingering on the horizon, imo this was a valid banning, regardless of the debate of the 6 invites guild.  <br>
<br>
You people are funny, these agreements are the only thing that keeps these BB guilds from walking in underneath ya and attempting to take the spawn.  They agree to respect your attempts, even though they can and are willing to go in and kill the god in a few hours, and all they ask is the following:<br>
<br>
DONT let the god live, DONT waste spawns.<br>
<br>
You apparently thought nothing of the compromises made between too many damn people to count.  Aside from what i have been trying to set up in the first place, there is no excuse for what happened here.  You ignored the actual spirit of what this is all about.  You think people owe you the spawns, they don't.  <br>
<br>
With so many people after these it is common decency to give a little and take a little, you decided that going in alone so you can obtain what you wanted was more important than the goal that each posting entity agreed to abide by, yourself included.  You ran the risk, and you lost.  You ARENT the first, i imagine you wont be the last.  <br>
<br>
Vince, me, Rewena, Edwina, and everyone else who was an admin took this posistion knowing that people were going to dislike some of their decisions, cause sometimes decisions have to be made.  Again, none of us do this JOB to make friends, i have those already.  We do it for one reason, so no one experiences what it is to see TOTAL chaos.  If that means dealing with the insults and the accusations, well so be it.  My character is strong enough to surpass it, and so is Vince's.<br>

Calling in a guild with what seems from the posts at hand to be between 30 minutes to maybe an hour with no prior notice is not only unfair, it shows no respect for all the prior problems happening, nor the SPIRIT of the agreement made when BB guilds were first introduced.  Every posting entity should be aware that the god should not live, and after all that has happened i really have no sympathy for an entity that can allow this problem to relapse and expect no retribution.  Especially one that's representitive doesn't seem to even care, and blew the thing off.</font><P><font color = green size = 4> Manas Pineblade, Woodlands Stalker<br>

Personally, I do think some punishment should be placed... either there current hate date is canceled, or the 30 day banning from planes after there reservation is met.  I do not think it should be both, since all the shit everyone put FR through, they did the same thing as all the other guilds did to FR, yet NONE of the other guilds were scolded, just FR.  I think 3 times is a little excessive, yes, but since you guys have failed as of late to put the deadline in, it is more your fault then theres.  Just my opinion, take it up the ass and ignore it, or use it, whatever.<br>

Forget when they called in the BB, who they invited, or how late they ran, if CT did not die they should get suspended /wo question.  <br>
<br>
When I posted earlier I thought they they did kill CT, just 30 minutes late after the BB guild didn't come because of the late call in.  They left a god up - thats deserves the suspension, and BoTS cannot be held acountable when it is that late with no prior communication.</font><P><table border=0 background="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/backg.gif"><TR><TD><TABLE border=0 background="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/backg.gif"><TR><TD><center><IMG src="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/elawndarhead.jpg" border=0></center></TD><TD><P><font color="white">"Barsh Barsh, pull another pally."<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp"Err, I could use a group.."</font></P></TD><TD><center><IMG src="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/elaundarhead.jpg" border=0></center></TD></TR><TR><TD><P align=center><font color="white">Elawndar<BR>Warrior 53</font></P></TD><TD><P align=center><font color="white">Frayed Knot<BR>The Rathe</font></P></TD><TD><P align=center><font color="white">Elaundar Nobillium<BR>Paladin 53</font></P></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxeddrc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xedd RC</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Wog</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>25</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>3/7/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12:33:18 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/xeddrc/froooaakkk.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: What kind of power trip...</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Evil, Legends of Marr got hit up with the same thing a while ago.

<br>
What I suggest is take this as a learning lesson. YOU (meaning admins), need to be very clear about the Rules, for your sanity and the rest of us. Because future guilds will make the same mistake ( which mistakes made I am still unclear about at this time). <br>
<br>
Also, and I do not care who you are, if you with Uber guild XXXX has been informed of an Epic mob being up, and you are unable to fullfile your role as BB, it is that guilds responsibility to inform whoever is next in line. <br>
<br>
Looking for a scape goat for mistakes solves nothing. BB were informed on SR time in the planes (though there is no set time). <br>
<br>
Perhaps we can solve this and move on using what has been said here and digested by all parties, and make something positive out of all this. Because unless we buy into a responsibility to each other, this community is a moot point. So lets fix it, and move on. <br>

Oh and the removal of calander rights is honestly just plane silly &lt;pun intended&gt;. <br>

Im tired of words of Tyranny and such, when people don't understand that no matter who's shoes you sit in it sucks all around.  Name one entity that is happy with everything in the system.  Im not, Emil isn't, jerrica isn't, Bias im sure isn't, Vince isn't.  We all have our own ideas of what should be, but like government, not everyone is gonna be happy all the time.  <br>
<br>
So long as people though sit back and complain about what is without making the attempt to change things for the better, then none of what you say in the end matters.  Without the sacrifice and the willingness to come out and try to find the most painless solution for ALL people, not just yourself, nothing will come of this except people angry about things they arent willing to try to make better.<br>
<br>
I invite you to try to find a better solution to keeping peace and getting everyone to agree to everything.  If you can then you should, cause I know i am incapable of it, I can only defend those like myself who have the marbles to continue to try at great length for people who aren't always appreciative when it comes their turn to be asked to refraine from doing something.</font><P><font color = green size = 4> Manas Pineblade, Woodlands Stalker<br>

<br>
This is what I think is resonable outcome from all this. <br>
<br>
1/ The big Brother Guild is informed by Midnight (pst) of a God being up and that guild is unable to clear it. <br>
<br>
2/ If the BB is unable to comply to 'rid' the plane of the God by 2 am into the following Guilds date, it is THEIR responsibility to inform the next Guild BB that the spawn is up. If ALL BB guilds are unable to meet the requirement to clear a God by a certain time, then the guild who has the date reserved must be informed that XXXX God is still up. <br>
<br>
3/ IMHO you should be able to invite as many non posting people on a guidl raid. They have no vested interest as they in turn are unable to return the favour and is well withing the spirit of the Rules. A guild with a calander posting rights remains at 6. On the flip side, those small guilds of 5 planable people will also get a chance to circulate in the planes, that in turn will relieve some preasure to you Admins about the 40 number, and in turn even LESS rescources are wasted. <br>
<br>
I shoudl state that this might not be resonable once the patch off test and what happens with Gods. But this might be an amiable solution to everyone, all parties, including the Admins. <br>
<br>
And lastly, I still fail to see where SR went wrong. It seems that this level os frustration they are going through is more than enough, and a lesson learnt for the community to rectify. <br>
<br>
I believe that about solves it. But if these ideas have merit, please, let us not Tally 6 months in debate and turn honest ideas into a soap opera. Live and learn, and lets move on. <br>

<br>
Any other issues (more than 6 from a guild/alliance, calling in BB, etc, etc) aside, there is one simple fact:<br>
<br>
Cazic was left up 24 hours longer than he needed to be.<br>
<br>
That is a violation of one of the basic calendar rules.  Leave a god up, take the punch.<br>
<br>
And if BotS didn't want to do it, The Epic Guilds message board indicated that DBN was next on the list.<br>
<br>
This same thing happened to my alliance on Sunday.  We had hate, we had just cleared the Maestro and were working on the remaining mobs when the server went down.<br>
<br>
We told BotS what was up (I assume, i wasn't running the raid), and kept in touch with them from 6pm until about 9:15 or so when we took down Inny.<br>
<br>
And I can tell you this:<br>
<br>
1 - if BotS hadn't come up, or weren't able to, we would've asked DBN, who were on 'backup' rotation.<br>
<br>
2 - if DBN couldn't do it, I suggested to the raid leaders that we just get ANYONE to come up and kill the damn god.  KEG, FR, whoever.  Because the key thing is KILLING THE GOD WHEN IT SPAWNS.<br>
<br>
If you can't understand that, I'm real sorry.  But it's not my problem, nor is it the problem of the admins.<br>
<br>
You signed up for a reserved raid.  part of that responsibility is making sure the god goes down.  If you can't get a BB up there in time, you find a way to do it.  You failed.<br>
<br>
Take your punishment (which is what others have had before you, you're not being singled out) and move on.<br>
<br>
I would have zero problems if we had failed in killing Inny and were banned from hate/fear for a month.  I'd EXPECT it.  I was warning people about that exact possible outcome in chat.<br>

However, I'd like to add that tho they did follow the rule of calling the Epic guild, they did so too late...whether or not there is a current guidline of what time to call.  Think about it...30 mins to assemble 2-3 groups, get them to Fear, get them buffed and intergrated into the holding entities groupings, and take down the temple and the god?  That's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> highly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> unreasonable, folks.  Perhaps if BotS had been sitting outside the portal, buffed and ready to go, 30 mins would have been enough time (perhaps a tad longer).</font><P><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Edwina Nytengayle<br> </strong></font></center>
