<br>
This was not a 'whiz bang' spyplane that landed in China. It was a P-3 Orion, a plane that was built in the 1950's.<br>
I seriously doubt a P-3 could outrun a '72 Beetle. Its a turboprop plane that's slower than dirt. It turns at the speed of a wounded duck and really couldnt ram a 'Jet Fighter', which shows the total silliness of the Chinese claims.<br>
<br>
China is a nation where 'image' is very important, and the real reason they are continuing to hold the plane and crew is simply to project a tough image. Similar to when a bully grabs a basketball and holds it over his head. The US will patiently wait and let the bully project his image. <br>
<br>
The Bush Administration has taken a harder line regarding human rights and TW towards the Chinese Government, and so the Chinese Government is trying to posture.<br>

Cheefa, three words. Roe V Wade. Opinions are like assholes, but the law is the law.<br>

I am a Conservative Republican, and you're not going to find too many Conservatives who support this issue.  Marijuana, just like tobacco, can also cause lung cancer.  Just get that pamphlet from the lung association (which liberals/hippies will say is just propaganda anyway, rofl), and it also has over 400 toxic chemicals in it, and if FRIES brain cells... just look at some of the posts on this thread. (But then again, you'll hear some liberals/hippies talk about your brain cell regeneration rate, and that marijuana wouldn't even have a negative effect on your brain.)  Also, the legalization of this dangerous mind-altering drug will also make it easier for children to get a hold of.  liberals are so infatuated with getting &quot;Stoned&quot; that they have to make up all this shit.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The P3-C Orion primarily is a sub-chaser, but it can be outfitted to do reconnaissance mission.<br>
<br>
Spying:<br>
1. To engage in espionage. <br>
2. To seek or observe something secretly and closely. <br>
<br>
Reconnaissance:<br>
1. An inspection or exploration of an area, especially one made to gather military information.<br>
<br>
P3-Cs' are loud, old, slow, and project a very large radar silhouette... very poorly suited for &quot;Spy&quot; missions.  However, they are great for reconnaissance because they are very reliable and long-legged aircraft.<br>
<br>
The Chinese government has stated repeatedly that it will not tolerate US planes monitoring their movements. The US has followed every international law and stayed well within international waters during reconnaissance missions. This is just the latest round of saber rattling. <br>

<br>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin refused USA help in finding the Chinese pilot who ejected from his fighter plane.  If found alive, would the Chinese nation rejoice, or would he disappear never to be heard from again to rub the USA's face in it.  Hmmmm ... Scary thought.<br>
<br>
Truth is if I were the Chinese government, I would hold on to that plane too if I had good reason.  Say for instance China had some strategic secret stuff on the island of Hainan.  Let's say they were concerned the USA's spy plane might have seen something it shouldn't have.  If it's video taped or recorded in any way, I'd want it removed.  Don't think for a minute we wouldn't do the same thing to their stuff if it landed in our country.  <br>
<br>
This holding crew and plane hostage stuff is crap.  It's plain kidnapping.  If the information on the plane was their mission they could send the crew back and then put the plane on one of their ships and carry it to a USA base near Hainan.  They would have ample time to inspect the plane with nice cover from our satelites.  There must be something more than that as Kiyojitsu said.  I think they are actually pissed the crew members survived.  No saving face if the world finds out what really happened.  Of course, we'll never really know, cause this is government crap and they'll cover up the good stuff.<br>
<br>
And finally, I sure wish Bill Clinton was back in office.  He'd say &quot;Jiang, send me over a dozen woman and a box of Cubans and then we can negotiate&quot;.

Taiwan is in negotiations with the USA to purchase sophisticated planes and China is against it.  Unexpectedly, a noted hot dog Chinese pilot is warned to back off from dangerous maneuvers, bumps are old jalopy and dies.  China political reasoning requires they get a moral upper hand, save face and demands an apology.  <br>
<br>
Meanwhile China desperately desires to have the Olympics held in their country.  It would be huge.  They are also negotiating for better trade agreements.  Are they willing to jeapordize this for an apology?  <br>

How can they save face in this?  How badly would China lose out if they lost the Olympics and trade talks ceases?  Could this get ugly?  Hmmm scary thoughts.. As I ramble on...<br>

If the Chinese plane crash landed on Hawaii or anywhere near or on the US mainland they would be home already.  No doubt about it, not even a chance in hell that they would be here still.  Do you ACTUALLY believe that China isn't spying on us?  If they're not then WOW - what idiots.  But the Chinese are NOT idiots so your statements are ridiculous.  They are in our country and all over the world, as is every country's spys (information gatherers).  <br>
<br>
The plane though might be delayed, as we inspect it.  That's a different story.  I'd want to check it out too.<br>
<br>
IMHO China just wants the USA to pay for a new plane.  If we were to apoligize for this incedent then we would be liable and that's just not right.  The fighter pilots were shadowing the plane in international waters, NOT the other way around.  So a bump in the sky would have been avoided if they just left the plane be.  Yes they had a right to Shadow the plane and YES the spy plane had a right to be in International waters.  Hence they called it an accident.  <br>
<br>
And as for the Elian story that was a family matter that got national attention.  Has nothing to do with USA.  They fought it out and Elian rightfully went back to his dad where he should be.  Thank God, cause those relatives were idiots.<br>

Back in the cold war days the Russians routinely flew Bear class bombers down the East coast of the United States. The thing that makes this issue different is that there was an air-to-air collision. The official story from the Chinese government that it is the American plane’s fault the accident occurred is ludicrous. Looking at the specifications of the aircraft would allow anyone with half a brain to figure out that the story given could only have occurred if the Chinese pilot wasn’t paying attention, had incredibly slow reflexes, or had some kind of problem with his aircraft like loss of steering control.<br>
<br>
The Chinese Shenyang J-8 (F-<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , Finback, Fighter is far more agile and maneuverable than the EP-3 AriesII. Top speed for the F-8 is 1,453mph (Mach 2.2). The P-3 tops out at 473mph. In an air-to-air encounter like this between fast moving interceptors and slow moving patrol craft, the interceptors are in complete control. <br>
<br>
Saying the F-8 could not avoid the cumbersome P-3 is like saying a jet powered ski boat could not avoid colliding with a sailboat. It is absurd, and no intelligent person would believe it.<br>
<br>
The Chinese government is very aggressive. The only reason they haven’t re-taken Taiwan is because they can’t. They do not have the resources to mount an amphibious take over of Taiwan (Standard military doctrine calls for a 5 to 1 ratio for an amphibious assault). They simply do not have enough naval units to transport enough troops to invade Taiwan. Also, the US would most probably intervene if an invasion of Taiwan were attempted.<br>
<br>
In short the collision was the Chinese fault. The US should not apologies for the incident, nor should the Chinese. The most reasonable thing to do is for both sides to acknowledge that these things happen when military forces meet, it’s no ones fault, it’s normal operating procedure. Troops die every day in training maneuvers… it’s part of the job. <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Kharras... rofl. No, it is the liberals who are the Anti-Americans. Look at what they stand for... It's pretty disgusting. Once again I have to list these: <br>
<br>
Abortion;well, at least this is a logical thing to be angry at, you have a perfect right to think this is vile /shrug<br>
<br>
 condom distibution to children; ----Hi this lessens the amount of abortions that you so hate. not everyone is you, not everyone cares about morals and praying to stop themselves from 'indulging in the sinful' if you could just realize that there ARE other people who have differant logical views and that there arent just people like YOU and people like YOU who went astray, maybe you could understand..<br>
<br>
banning prayer from schools; ----they damn well better, imposing religeon on others, in a place of manditory attendance is just evil... if it were a lesser religeon besides christianity imposed on people youd be all pissed, you know you would=p<br>
<br>
 they want to take &quot;In God We Trust&quot; of our currency;----now a days there is more and more religeous diversity, this is offensive to people, youd be cheesed im sure if it had a witch catchphrase or something alike..<br>
<br>
 In California, they made it mandatory for schools to teach &quot;Ebonics&quot;... Ebony Phonics. This point in and of itself makes my blood boil; ---- why not? people are being educated about differant dialects and the racial gap gets just a little bit smaller. obviously you dont want those good white kids to be involved with those evil black people though.<br>
<br>
 To get a teaching credential in California now, you have to take a class in &quot;Gay Life&quot; and have to physically go to a gay bar or event to study them; --- again, lowering the gap between sexual prefference, why do you have a problem with this??? thats very counterculture if you ask me, its closed minded people like you that want to keep people seperate that destroy our country.<br>
They want to legalize marijuana (don't even go into the people with cataracts and Aids bullshit);--- you may be surprised, but lumping hippies/liberals/democrats all together is NOT a good idea, a very small portion want to legalize it, mostly the hippies. again, your just lumping people  into a mass with little to no evidence... as you said yoruself. GO STUDY!!!!!... jackass <br>
<br>
<br>
Banning gun ownership rights; -------guns are here to stay, ive NEVER heard a democrat say they will actively attempt to ban guns... if your afraid of waiting a few days to cool down, then its obvious maybe a gun isnt for you... although you still have the right to get it=\<br>
<br>
Lowering the minimum passing grade on exams so certain minorities can pass them; Placing criminals in &quot;educational programs&quot; (which don't work) instead of throwing them in prison where they belong, because they were &quot;abused&quot; as children. ---- all i can say is that your a cold hearted racist =\ look at yourself man.<br>
<br>
I can go on and on. FUCK YOU. Liberalism SCREAMS out ignorance. That's all I have to say. If you want all this bullshit, then move to Amsterdam. We're going to fight to take our country back and bring ethics and moral values back to America. Thank God Almighty, that George W. Bush was elected... he's going to head us in the right direction. ------- if you LOOK at bush... hes an idiot.. he cant say &quot;subliminal&quot;, he stumbles on words, he cant write his own speeches,  he barely shows up on camera because i quote &quot;he doesnt want to be over scrutinized&quot; haw, thanks for picking a low profile job like president..   so think what you want mindia, but when you call people ignorant and simply ignore what you have said (which it lacks almost all logic)  you get fire backs... have fun burning your witches and getting mad at people who dont agree with you. <br>

Anyhow - just wanted to touch on the legalizing of marijuana - it's the only one you didn't have a sound argument for.  Actually your argument was lame - so I'll toss one out for you to reply too.  <br>
<br>
Legalizing marijuana would be an economic boom.  <br>
The US drug war would be able to concentrate on offensive drugs, rather than the non-offensive weed that just makes you stupider.<br>
Farmers would grow weed if it turns a profit<br>
Clothing stores and other manufacturers would have savings using hemp as they did in the early 1900's.<br>
<br>
Truth is many of us tax-payers would like to see it legalized, but we have a hard time legalizing something that's harmful to your health.  Unlike alcohol and now tobacco, marijuana smokers are a little to relaxed to fight for legality.  Drunks and hyper smokers though - they can fight.<br>

A better way to say that is - many of us taxpayers are tired of our taxes wasted on a war against a weed.  I don't care if they legalize it, just don't spend our hard earned money tracking down a freaking weed.<br>
<br>
Talk about issues - imagine explaining to our forefathers that in 200 years we will spend billions of dollars on a war against a weed that people smoke to relax and get stupid.  <br>

i just dont believe in drugs... i have no problem with people using them as long as they dont bug ME, but i felt posting reasoning for something i didnt believe in would just throw me into the category of a bleeting sheep following a party blindly  (isnt it interesting you see NO conservatives who are anti-gun? people just fall in and believe all the partys ideas=\)<br>
