No offense, but some people can rely on faith rather than proof. I have proof - it's in my heart." T- Man<br>
<br>
im not talking about proof, or personal beliefs at all... let me explain...<br>
<br>
beyond what you believe, and what I believe there is TRUTH outside of the way we percive it.. this is what im talking about.. we all have misconceptions, and personal perceptions that distort what is really TRUTH.  <br>
<br>
If your perception and misconceptions have caused you to believe in a God who is not there or a God wouldn't you want to know that?  <br>
<br>
If you get stuck on the fact that you believe your religion is true then switch your shoes with someone who is of a different religion.. imagine you were that person, wouldn't you want them to question wether or not they were believing in the truth?  I think so.<br>
<br>
If you aren't willing to give up your God for TRUTH, then you should evaluate wether you are really following a God or just your own beliefs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uooslitheoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>oO Slithe Oo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Will O Wisp</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/02 9:46:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6113.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sigh</span><hr size=1> Bask - Have I read the bible?  Yes.<br>
<br>
You know what Seminary is for Mormon children?  For all 4 years of high school you are forced to wake up at 4:30am before school, go to church, and study the bible and their Book of Mormon for about 3 hours each day.  Yes, I was forced to go to church 6 out of the 7 days of the week, but only because my parents let me skip out on the &quot;Youth Activities&quot; that went on on Saturdays.<br>
<br>
Sure, there's a whole lot of guided propoganda going on, with the teachers trying to press their interpretations upon you in your dazed, half-awake state, but a good, healthy study of the Bible (and don't get me started on the Book of Mormon) is what started me researching other religions in the first place.<br>
<br>
So I got to really researching.  Simple Question: Do you know what Catholocism is?  <br>
<br>
One possible answer: Catholocism is the boot that crushed Gnosticism, another early Christian religion that began about the same time as Catholocism.  No, not AGnosticism.  Gnosticism.<br>
<br>
Out of the Gospel of Thomas, of the Nag Hammadi texts:<br>
&quot;Jesus said, `I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have become drunk from the bubbling stream which I have measured out.... &quot;<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
&quot;He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am: I myself shall become he, and the things that are hidden will be revealed to him.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Both Quotes: www.gnosis.org)<br>
<br>
That's straight from the horse's mouth: Jesus is not your master.  He's a teacher, and if you listen to him... well, you get the picture.<br>
<br>
But wait!  That's not out of the Bible, you say!!  No, that's out of a different piece of literature banned and burned by the early Catholic Church because it expoused personal experience and personal revelation, rather than strict obedience to static dogma that is based upon a man as a perfect son of God.  Banned and burned because the &quot;heresy&quot; came straight from the man they claimed as their mascot.<br>
<br>
But don't take my word for it.  Research yourself.  Really dig into your religion's history.  I'm not trying to convert you to my religion.  Like Sierra pointed out: I don't have a religion.  Unlike your local representative of whatever church you attend and pay tithing to (or whatever they call it there), I have nothing to gain by you using your brain.  But they may have something to lose by it.  <br>
<br>
And if all the discrepencies and loopholes in all the organized religions out there do not convince you of their artificiality, I will both respect your faith, first amendment style, and mock your stupidity similarly.<br>
<br>
But the link to the Christian band didn't set this off.  It was Sierra's blatant &quot;You're not Christian, so how can can you pray?&quot; exclusionary, elitist, Christian-centric insinuations that got me in a huff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umeren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Savior</span><br>  Posts: 618<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 1:29:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6113.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://clunfen.freeservers.com/images/fahrenheit.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sigh</span><hr size=1> Bottom line is no one on Earth knows God.

Then your friend gives that message to another friend and they give it to their friend etc etc etc until the message is no longer a reflection of its author, but a reflection of the last person to tell it with the author's name attributed as the source...thats what your faith is based on.  Half assed stories that arose from the writings of ancient peoples that were, EVEN BACK THEN, building upon half assed stories from their forefathers.  Christianity is based on Judaism.  Judaism is based on Zoroasterism.  Zoroasterism is a bastardization of various polytheistic religions.  You honestly think that there is a hell...and if you don't believe what another man tells you is &quot;the truth&quot; you will go there?  Thats fine...its natural to want to be consoled and directed.  Everyone feels that need, but some of us don't fulfill it with a notion so full of holes that the only defense it has is the finality of death.  The only way to &quot;proove&quot; your beliefs are bullshit is to die and come back to life saying there is no heaven, no hell, and no god.  Thats not going to happen.  Because it doesn't happen.  You think it does because someone wrote that it did in a book.   For that you have my pity because you are foolish.

<br>
Please, give me a biblical passage, and the historic occurrance that it predicted.<br>
<br>
Then prove that the passage isn't completely, ambiguously, open-ended, so that the only thing that could have possibly occurred to fulfill the prediction is the historic event you provided.<br>
<br>
Feel free to take your time and really dig hard.  I'm in no rush.  I doubt you could do this in your lifetime.<br>
<br>
Simple Question: why do people interpret the Bible as &quot;predicting&quot; things like cars / computers and inane, trivial crap like market crashes and anti-christian nay-sayers?<br>
<br>
Simple Answer: It's a lot easier to &quot;predict&quot; new technology and common occurrances than to say, write out in plain Hebrew &quot;ADOLF HITLER WILL BE BORN APRIL 20, 1889 IN BRAUNAU, AUSTRIA, AND WILL BE A SCUMBAG, THNX INFO LA~ -GOD&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uemmiery.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EmMiery</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tech Mas Gnoll</span><br>  Posts: 458<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 2:52:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6113.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pumpkinpants.homestead.com/files/totakeke.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sigh</span><hr size=1> Prophecies are self fulfilling... they happen because we think they are going to. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19794">Miery Van Houten</a><br><a href="http://www.triadcontinuum.com">Triad Continuum</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uantonelf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>antonelf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy Taunt God</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 3:00:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6113.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A band for teens... go look =)</span><hr size=1> Religious fanaticism is what causes events like what happened on September 11th to happen. Thankfully there are people who live by reason, rather than &quot;faith&quot; who have been able to keep the bible thumpers at bay. Seperation of church and state in America was a brilliant idea designed to keep religious zealots from forcing their doctrine down people's throats. Believe whatever the hell you want, just don't tell me you &quot;know&quot; there is a God, you look like a fool. And also, I for one, am in love with life on earth. If you are a bible thumper, you may not realize it, but you are taught to be in love with death. Flame away if you want, but do not tell me that you are not promised rewards beyond your wildest dreams &quot;beyond the grave&quot;. Very appealing to those who are dissatisfied in their own lives for sure.<br>

In fact the bible, along with the Koran, and other  compilations of religious scripts are among the most reliable ancient manuscripts we current have, there are tens of thousands of copies of these scripts that can be used to determine how closely they resemble the original.  This does not imply at all that they are true just because they match the orignial, but it does establish them as authentic, and bibliographicly accurate.<br>
<br>
There is a whole lot of information both religious/non-religious on this subject in the internet.  There is little debate that many religious documents, including the bible are in fact 90% bibliographicly accurate.  Wether what they say are true or not well... thats another issue.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukiliaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiliaan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=118247902&img=5" BORDER=0> at: 2/1/02 5:23:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukiliaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiliaan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=118247902&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Werewolf</span><br>  Posts: 339<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 5:48:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6113.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A band for teens... go look =)</span><hr size=1> "Religious Fanatacisim" may have caused some of the most tragic events in history, there is no doubt about that.

The reason I have been posting is because I believe that religion is a good thing (not all religion mind you).  And alot of people have just closed off thinking about all types of religion in a logical way for whatever reason, be it expierences or perhaps legitimate arguements.   Religion should coorispond with reailty, faith and reason should work hand in hand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uemmiery.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EmMiery</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tech Mas Gnoll</span><br>  Posts: 460<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/1/02 6:02:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6113.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pumpkinpants.homestead.com/files/totakeke.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A band for teens... go look =)</span><hr size=1> I'm just waiting for someone to mention Satanism...

Satan != Lucifer, and true Satanists are agnostic.  <br>
I think also that Satanists believe in gluttony, or not depriving oneself of something they want.  Food, sex, etc.  It's about enjoying life to the fullest by doing what you want, when you want to regardless of repercussions.<br>
<br>
Personally, I worship the Squirrel and the Nut.<br>

You said that it is impossible to &quot;know&quot; that there is a God, and to do so is to be a fool.  Well, saying that you know there is a God is saying you can prove he exists.  Saying there isn't a God is saying you can prove he doesn't exist.  Can you prove to me that God doesn't exist?  <br>
<br>
As far as longing for death or celebrating death.  Well, I have gone to church all my life and been a Christain for the better part of my life.  According to what I believe, I know what will happen to me when I die.  Do I look forward to dying? no.  I want every chance to live my life and see what I can accomplish, but I know when that time comes, again according to what I believe, I am pretty content with how it will turn out.<br>
<br>
Slithe, if I may make an assumption, or just say what I saw in your last post.  You aren't interested, and seem to detest religion because you can't find the answers anywhere you want.  Religions are based on faith, I can't think of one that isn't.  But faith is what happens when you believe in something, when you trust in something.  You want someone to guide you through life feeding you the answers.  Again, just what I saw in the last post you wrote.  <br>
<br>
Not trying to single out or flame, but these are the last two posts that caught my eye, I imagine this will spark some response.  I am willing to get involved in a good religious debate, not an argument, but an intelligent, thought out debate. <br>

<br>
There is some scientific evidence that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> suggests</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a god exists.  I'm not going to pretend to understand it all, cause I don't, but there's tons of books and other materials that mention all that stuff.  I guess the most popular would be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> A Brief History of Time</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by Hawking.  Again, I'm not trying to sound like an authority on this, cause I'm really not, but if you want to read up on it, it's there.<br>
<br>
Oh, some more stuff that I'm not a huge authority on, but I know enough to tell you about =)  If you think that the &quot;reason&quot; some live by is so much better than the &quot;faith&quot; of some others, go check out Kurt Godel.  An interpretation by a teacher of mine basically boiled down to saying &quot;Physics is a religion&quot; =)  Crazy @#%$.  I'm always free if someone really wants to go at it about this, send a tell in game sometime if yer really interested.<br>

I did not make the statement &quot;I know God does not exist&quot;. Others made the statement &quot; I know god does exist&quot;. Ancient Greeks were proved wrong when people climbed Mount Olympus and found nothing there. It was a brilliant idea to say &quot;he is everywhere, but you can't see him, you have to have faith&quot;, I will give you that much. And no, I am not a satan worshipper or anything like that. Satan was made up by religious people, in order to believe there is a &quot;Satan&quot;, you must believe there is a &quot;God&quot;. <p>
