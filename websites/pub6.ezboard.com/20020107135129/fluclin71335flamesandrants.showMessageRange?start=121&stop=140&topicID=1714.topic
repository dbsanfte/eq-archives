An interesting tidbit for those that care...in the book Dante's Inferno about that guy Dante who many centuries ago had this vision or journey through hell, and he carved the whole thing into these massive gates (I'm a little fuzzy on the details read it many years ago). Anyways I stray from the point.  In this book murderers were sent to say the 6th circle of hell or something like that, where as betrayers went straight to the ninth circle of hell.  Some people consider betrayel of a trust to be a more damning offense then murder.  I mean if you can't trust your friends and guildleaders not to lie and steal from you, who can you trust?  And if you can't trust anyone but yourself...well then you're probably keeping the wrong sort of people as friends.<br>

<br>
anyways yeah lets all read some old epic novels that everyone now calls the &quot;bible&quot; and instead of looking at hard scientific evidence showing how we evolved lets worship some &quot;god&quot; on blind faith because an old couple of dusty scrolls and books that they read for entertainment back in the day got confused with our creation somehow. np tho im sure we can all believe in some guy parting a sea to walk thru over a scientist showing you like 30 different pieces of concrete evidence as to where and what we came from. if you want to believe in that stuff its all good and fine im not gonna knock you tho. its always good to have belief in something. you can now resume your childish debates.<br>
oh yeah.<br>

Having a deity, killing an npc, deuling, pickpoceting, is all <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> fantasy</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Bigox stole from another player, a person behind the machine.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> That</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is real.  Can you not see that?<br>
<br>
Beavadien, all the &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;concrete&quot; scientific evidence I've seen is always full of holes.  For example, all the energy that started the big bang.  How did it get there?  Did it magically appear somewhere in the universe and then just explode?  Where's the scientific evidence for this?<br>
<br>
Also, another point thats fuzzy.  When does non-living matter become living?  At what point? How?  Scientist's have been able to recreate every single step accept this one.  Living matter can <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> come from other living matter.  Look at any species on Earth and you will see this.  So I'm interested as to how, and what point did non-living matter become living, on its own.<br>
<br>
Also, another issue.  Morality.  Why do we have morals?  According to Darwinism and natural selection, its survival of the fittest.  Male lions kill other cubs for the survival of their own.  Yet in humanity, we would find that horrifying.  Why?  Isn't it natural that we should beat everyone else into the ground to put ourselves ahead?  Yet we care about those who suffer.  We have pity, compassion.  We have a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> conscience</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Hmm, where did that come from?  These are questions I have not seen answered from among your &quot;30 pieces&quot; of hard evidence, beav, or from any atheist or evolutionist.<br>

Me, I'm kinda happy to leave life's mysteries a mystery.  I don't need to know what exact mechanics of brain chemicals, or god-given soul allow me to tell the difference from right and wrong.  It's enough that I do know that difference.  I believe in god because against all likely-hood I've had prayers answered.  Maybe it's just dumb luck, but what do you care if I like the thought that there's something out there that works a little magic on my behalf sometimes.<br>
<br>
No theory is perfect.  There's holes in every belief, science included.  Scientific theory is based on conclusions that we've drawn as mere imperfect humans.  We're assuming that things happened in the past the way we interpret the data of today.  And I won't even get into all the holes in the bible.  In actuality no one fucking knows.  Maybe we're all some test-tube experiment of a superior species from another planet.  I say pick whichever belief makes you happiest and brings you comfort, and let everyone else believe in whatever makes them happy.  There's enough 'evidence' to support just about any set of beliefs out there, aethism included, although I can't help thinking that aethism is kind of dismal.  But then this is from the girl who still firmly believes in Peter Pan.<br>

Chak, Im not saying stealing is a good thing. And yes i know the difference between right and wrong. But my good ol pops taught me that, and i taught myself through experience, not some church sermon. All i'm saying dude, im not defending anyone, or bashing anyone. Just saying why bring religon into this. It doesn't belong in other peoples lives if they dont want it too. How would you like someone like Osama bustin thru your door with a buncha AKs and strapping you to a chair and preaching how killing all americans is the right thing to do because americans are bad. If you dont believe in me not believing in anything then thats your problem. The way i see it, all religons are stupid. Look at the countless wars/fights that started over them, and look at the countless people killed just because they worship something else. Just making an example man dont get offended cause im not aiming for that.

If you belive in some kind of god, but you are wrong and there isnt, you will never know when you die anways, so its no biggie.<br>

Hell is an old english word meaning &quot;hole in the ground.&quot; Did you ever have a root cellar? Before Root cellars, folks buried food to keep it cool and preserve it from animals: place your potatoes in Hell.<br>
<br>
This is part of the problem of translating text from one language into another (and then believing that the result is the original). The original word used was Gehenna, which was the local garbage dump, where trash was burned.<br>
<br>
Damnation and hellfire? Not in the original at all. They are fictions added by mis-translators.<br>

there's a huge difference between Religion and God..<br>
it's easy to believe in a God simply for &quot;reality's&quot; sake.. since we have no clue how we got here, etc. at this point in time, it's easy to say there's some un-seen power over-seeing things<br>
but that doesn't mean you need to believe in a religion to believe in a God. all religions (that i know of) have a bottom line of morals they are trying to enforce upon their followers. and they are all pretty similar. mostly revolving around the Golden rule. as long as you follow the Golden rule, you should be fine. and to think a god would only accept one &quot;religion&quot; for everyone on earth, even those that lived in secluded places and never even had a chance to hear of someone elses beliefs of heaven and hell and god, etc. that means they have no chance of going to heaven.<br>
and yes, i know some religions make exceptions for those people.. but why not just make exceptions for anyone you choose then? *shrug*<br>
<br>
<br>
oh, and to whoever started babbling about evidence of &quot;life&quot; what gives us morality?<br>
*i think*....<br>
basically the only thing that makes us special is that fact that we have an extensive memory.. once you can remember events you can analyze them and choose how you think based on your past experiences and knowledge.<br>
if you were to remove someone's memories completely, would you actually expect them to be moral?<br>
do you expect a little kid to be moral, before you teach them what morals are?<br>
morality isn't a learned behavior as much as it is a series of decisions we are uniquely able to make due to our memories full of what we have learned through out our life.<br>
