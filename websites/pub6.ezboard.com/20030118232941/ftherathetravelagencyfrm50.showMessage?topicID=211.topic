<br>
The whole rotation system that we have set up here is based on the old mobs and old tactics. With the nerf bat now enhanced by the Mark of McGwire spell, the ability of guild X to handle mob Y is going to become a serious question, at least for the lower-tier guilds. I expect that many guilds are going to find out that they can no longer handle some mobs, mobs that they were on rotation with before the shift in game mechanics. This really won't affect the &quot;Big Three&quot; (BOTS, TL, NB) except for forcing them to rewrite their playbooks. But for the smaller guilds, it's going to be a real issue.<br>
<br>
So how are we, as the Rathe community, going to handle this? I can see a few options...<br>
<br>
1. Keep the current rotations, and require guilds to prove that they can handle a mob, or be removed from its rotation.<br>
<br>
2. Keep guilds in the current rotation, but autopass guilds that can no longer handle whatever mob, until such time as they can beat the mob again.<br>
<br>
There's probably other options, but these are the only two that occur to me right now. I'm not even considering FFA as an option, because we all know how bad that would be.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm bringing this up for discussion now so it doesn't blow up in our faces in the near future. What do you all think? <p>Galavant Greenlabel, Dwarf Cleric-56<BR>

<br>
Complete heal for all but the 1 or 2 biggest HP'd warriors on our server is still a complete heal. In a solid suit of skyshrine armor, and some not-too-bad gear, and raid buffed, I hit 5700hp. 7500 is *still* as complete a heal as I need. <br>
<br>
You need, I would guess, at least the ability to get the VERY best luclin items to see 7500 raid buffed, and perhaps it would take Vex Thal access to hit that 7500+ range. (Without exploit stacking mind you :P )<br>
<br>
So no, CH rotations will *not* be so blatently altered as to cause the demise of the rotation systems. <br>
<br>
Secondly, the devaluing of Mod rods may well influence tactical decisions and the longer timed fights: Verant has, though admittedly with a horrible track record, said they will retune fights that last so long that they require infinite mana. <br>
<br>
In any event, mana regen issues will be countered by using necromancers as walking rods, in conjunction with mod rods. This will not change 32k fights from our kunark rotations. <br>
<br>
I would suggest that, at the most, we just watch to see what guilds are not defeating their rotation mobs any longer, and if it is a continuing trend: if people wipe because the mobs require differant tactics, that's not a reason to suggest that *everyone* has to redo their admittance to a rotation mob.<br>
<br>
This is a sleeping dog that should lie: those guilds who continue to be unable to drop their rotation mob... should leave the rotation. As it is, we allow I think 2 failed attempts before there is anything said. <br>

Although i also think certain other Luclin mobs will also cause a few more problems to some of the newer guilds to try them, who would previously have utilised mod rods perhaps to increase their available mana pool, AoW, Roy, Vyemm maybe and possibly tunare (although if you get to the point your clerics have run oom on Tunare i believe your allready doing CR hehe).<br>
<br>
EQ is a game of progression, as your guild gains in power you find certain content becomes trivial to your resources, you soon start to refine your tactics, an example of this would be NB vs AoW, our first kill was around 12minutes, i believe we have easily halved that time now on this encounter. Once you work out the best way to deal with an encounter its all about refining your needs for that encounter.<br>
<br>
The change to content that Verant has stated will probably only affect Ssra and other Luclin encounters and go into PoP encounters (hopefully), and to be honest, tactics are a huge part of these fights, you simply cannot walk into Arch Liche room with 30 clerics and expect to win this fight because you have more than enough healing, whilst mod rods create an almost unlimited amount of mana you still need the general tactics and knowledge of the encounter to succeed. <br>
<br>
In general, i think any guild that continuously manages to *pull off* a kill because they have had to rely mainly on mages summoning mod rods will suffer alot with these changes IF Verant doesnt tune them correctly.<br>
<br>
Its kinda crazy when you think about the line that Verant has to create here, do they opt for a mob with alot of HP making it a chore to kill, a long boring grinding fight where everyone but the clerics and mages are afk watching DVD's, or are they going to opt for Zergfest fights where you can run in and pound on a mob for 20seconds to kill it ala Kunark Dragons.<br>
<br>
I think alot of Luclin contect will get tuned and retuned a few times before its right.<br>
<br>
And also at the end of the day players will still find easy ways to trivialise these and many other encounters, how far will Verant go with the nerf bat on classes *balancing* them and encounters?<br>
<br>
Also in regards to the CH change, NB has a few tanks on the 7K+ mark of HP, a few almost near the 7500K HP mark i believe, but verant is right to change CH from 10500 to 7500HP, with the AA's available to players now this isnt really going to make much of a difference to current content. With the induction of PoP and tanks breaking the 10K HP mark with ease, they are allready going to trivialise current content even more, your tanks will run less risk of getting killed by mobs due to being able to take more of a pounding and giving clerics that little extra time to get the heals off. Also this should create a bit less healing aggro for clerics (probably wont tho knowing Verant). I really dont see this change affecting alot of people til they are well into PoP skills and AA's and killing PoP content. It certainly wont affect much of the current content i can assure you.<br>
<br>
As for the RTA Rotations, i say leave them as they are, if a guild fails or passes 3 times in a row on their rotation mob then look at removing them from this rotation at that time. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><imgsrc="http://http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/10395.jpg"><br>

That's all we can do at this point in time.  We have no idea of how much, or little, these changes will affect us.<br>

There are no changes anticipated for the Rotations at this point in time.  <br>

<br>
FK for instance has no full time mages at the moment and many rotation encounters are done with no rods already, and we survive just fine. Nor have we ever used monks to tank rampage mobs.  That would be the only nerf that effect most second tier guilds at this time.<br>
