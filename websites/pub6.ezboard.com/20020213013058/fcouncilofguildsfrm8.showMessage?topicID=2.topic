If you wish to join in the raids, here is how it will work.<br>
<br>
Soon, Jzonn will ask for a spot in the Nagafen rotation (if he hasn't already). This is through Karana Guild Central or KGC. Now, the way the KGC rotation works is someone kills the dragon, and they post it to the KGC board. The dragon's spawn times are 9 days +/- a random time of up to 48 hours (i.e. anywhere between 7 days and 11 or 12 days). The next group in the rotation is then charged with keeping track of when that dragon spawns again. When he spawns, the group whose rotation is up has 1 day to make a run at the dragon. If they are successful, they kill the dragon and post it to the board. If not, whether they get killed or don't have enough to make the attempt, they post to the board and the next group in the rotation is up, and has 1 day to attempt a kill. And so it goes through the rotation. Dragons also will spawn if the server is rebooted for any reason (i.e. the whole server is brought down accidentally or intentionally), so this means after patch day, the dragon should be back up. <br>
<br>
So Jzonn will get the AC/CoG spot on the Nagafen rotation, and will watch the board. When we are 3 spots away from being up for the dragon, Jzonn will post here calling for volunteers from the CoG member guilds. To volunteer, you must post your character name, guild and email. On the day that we come up for Nagafen, Jzonn will post to this forum the details of the raid, as well as emailing those who volunteered for the raid. If needed, they will take those CoG members who show up at the raid, but ONLY if they do not already have enough to make the raid. Also, those who sign up will be given PRIORITY over any who did not. <br>
<br>
The raid will be made by a group of 20-25 people, more depending on what Jzonn feels is needed. Jzonn will reserve a set number of slots for his management body, which he will pick, and any remaining members of the raid will be filled out on a first come first serve basis on those who post here and are available on the date. No one is guaranteed a spot, though obviously those who sign up and show up will be given a spot if one is available. <br>
<br>
Loot rules will be posted by Jzonn when he can. No one is guaranteed to get any loot or experience on these raids, nor is anyone guaranteed that they won't lose experience or have an irretrievable corpse. The raiding group will make every effort possible to retrieve corpses and/or resurrect people, but we cannot guarantee that either of these can happen. Enter the raid at your own risk. I want to thank Jzonn and Ikada and the rest of the members of Avenging Crusaders for allowing the CoG to go on these raids, and for organizing them. They deserve a round of applause for the work they are putting on themselves to accomplish this. <br>
<br>
Should this type of dragon raid succeed, I forsee adding a Vox raid in the future as well. <br>
<br>
Jzonn, please post any corrections to this procedure as well as your looting rules. <br>

<br>
I want to take the time to clear up a few things.<br>
<br>
1)  This isn't an AC raid with hanger-ons.  If I'm running it, I'll treat it just like any other raid we've done so far.<br>
<br>
2)  Loot rules haven't changed.  No member of the raid will be given special treatment in the loot of a dragon (except the Palys and their FA books).<br>
<br>
3)  We are on the list for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> both</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> dragons at this time.  That's right...we're at the bottom of the list, but we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on the lists.<br>
<br>
4)  The level range for a dragon raid is 40+ for tanks, 45+ for casters.  However, in the event of an overflow, preference will be given to tanks 45+ and casters 48+.<br>
<br>
5)  I won't hesitate to call off the dragon portion of a raid if we don't have the appropriate make-up of classes to pull it off.  We will run the giant portion of the raid if the turn-out is sufficient.  If I do call off the dragon portion, please have the courtesy to stick around for the giants.  Just because you've done giants six times, doesn't mean everyone has.<br>
<br>
If I think of anything else, I'll be sure to follow up on this thread with it.  I look forward to many successful raids with everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=belcegaegwynsd>Belce Gaegwyn SD</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(9/17/00 11:41:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dragon Raids</span><hr size=1> I am there.  <br>

One question. Will you be imposing a minimum Fire/Cold/Magic resistance? Or at least a suggested minimum?<br>

I can only say that you should have as much of a particular resistance as you can (i.e., Cold and Magic if facing Vox).  At a very minimum, I've been told you should have 75 Fire/Cold without buffs.  Magic resistances are always a big help, but can be harder to raise.  If you can get to 75 without buffs, I think you are in great shape.  I would probably consider 50 a minimum for this stat.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, it will be the resistances that keep you around longer and hopefully the full time.  The longer you can survive, the easier it is for the healers to save you when you get into trouble on your health. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sertaincrimsonpepper>sertain crimsonpepper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(9/27/00 5:05:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> signing up for dragon raids</span><hr size=1> Thanks to Jzonn, Ikada, Haemish, etc.  for all your information on the rules of kcog dragon and planes raids.
