A short time after these hits, the Pentagon in Washington D.C. was hit by a suicide aircraft and has estimated deaths at 1,000 or more. This is the most horrific event ever to take place in the United States and I will always remember this throughout my lifetime. Tragically, in Palestine, citizens were cheering all over for the deaths that have taken place today, chanting &quot;God is Good&quot; and handing out candy throughout the streets. My father was working in the Pentagon as a Government Contractor and I still have not heard from him since the initial attack. <br>
<br>
Please, everyone of any nationality or ethenticity please say a prayer for every family who must endure the suffering that this will cause. This was not an act of war, it was an act of cowards. The people who did this are surely not men, they are monsters. This was not an attack on the United States, it was an attack on humanity. Targeting the most populated city in the country is NOT a military attack it is a sickening one. <br>
<br>
What disturbs me further about this, is that schools all across the nation closed early and may not have class tomorrow. THIS IS THE POINT OF THESE ATTACKS. These bastardly cowards WANT us to be terrified. I for one will no longer tolerate this kind of violation of freedom.. and if the United States ever takes arms against Palestine with Isreal I will gladly die for the cause. It is part of these Islamic religons to die while exterminating an enemy, it automatically makes the person a martyr in theyre religion so i have No doubt that this attack was launched by parties residing in the Middle East or Palestine. <br>
<br>
God bless America, and all of mankind who has suffered this day. <br>

I live in California and i wake up at 5:15 in the morning before school to go to a church class. When i got there i heard about it and after it we listened on the radio all the way to school and than i went to my history class to listen. School is not out for us and for good reason. The head of the school district for us realizes that by stopping what we do is helping the terrorist and also showing the great fear we have. We're all with some fear but no not who to blame. Please remember that we don't want to repeat things of the past. I was greatly disheartened today to here in my highschool kids who wanted to beat up people of that ethnic background if any of those middle east countries are found responsible. But these kids aren't one to make idle threats and if i see any of them trying to harass these kids i will more than stand up for them cause they deserve as much respect as we all do. This is just reminding me of WWII of how we treated the Japanese. We mustn't punish them for who they are. When people are scared they want to find something to target there agression on and this is not the way to solve the problem. And the people in Israel i can understand them celebrating after the pain we have caused them in order to try and maintain peace. We are not a very well liked country to alot of countries unfortunately but howerver we do have allies as well. If there is a country associated be sure to realize that if there is a war all countries who hate us might take the opportunity to destroy us as well. We are a very advanced country but not indestrucible. But to note, if one of those coutries is held responsible we shouldn't make the generalization that there bad or you will be no worst than the israel people cheering in the streets. They too have families as we do and death of people is never a good thing. Sorry for boring you all but i felt i had some things to say. I will pray for all families and people who were in those places. Good luck to you all and lets hope for the best. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uviaincendium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Via Incendium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(9/11/01 8:39:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Terrorism on Humanity</span><hr size=1> If your mom and dad worked in the WTO building and you have not heard of them yet... would your opinions change?<br>

We are part of a larger world, part of one world, one community with many faces and to hurt one face in that community is to hurt and lessen us all. The monsters who did these acts deserve to be punished, as they gave up their humanity when they disregarded the value of human life. Do not punish those who are different than you because they share a gene with those who did this insanity, or a religion. <br>
