I am sorry for the messy version.<br><br>Tzuten, I treat your words with high regard and your reply was very much what I wanted to see in response regardless of what you actually had to say. What you said did in a sense set my impression of the incident as a whole in stone from both sides. I am going to use some quotes below because I wish to respond to a few things that I feel contradict the actions of those who, like you, wish to solve the issue. <br><br>I am not picking a fight. I have been offended personally now by this and I feel if my family or I were going to be attacked online I should respond here where the attacker bases the harassment.<br><br>Tzuten your word is gold, I post this not to argue but to express my reply and hopes for resolve. If at any point I get sarcastic excuse me but I did calm down before posting.<br><br>Thundaron &amp; Kagato it is good to see a reply from you as well.<br><br>This morning, Aspo a member of SoT began harassing my wife while we were in Kael as well as some threats to me. He claims to be Asmog, as you will see below. This is a line that should not have been crossed. I am posting screen shots and logs from both of us however I speak only for myself in the matter and Dovelyn is her own person.<br><br>-----Begin cuts-----<br><br>First I ask Rihtsea why you are posting on a thread with respectful posts from SoT members showing disrespect of any kind? It insults those of your guild in the string being sincere. I question your sincerity here deeply with your words.<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> On a more serious note.. Trompen, good luck on your epic, and I am sorry things happened the way they did. Rihtsea 3-24-02 10:22:09 AM PST&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Are you truly sorry? Yesterday you had different remarks about this matter and you don’t sound much different today.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;In reference to the RTA post, can you say &quot;jumping on the bandwagon?&quot; -Rihtsea on SoT MB Posted: 2002-03-23 17:22'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>I see your post on Thundarons string as you referenced the RTA post, &quot;Jumping on the bandwagon&quot;. I sense no remorse or real concern other than not wanting to look poorly just in case. This is just how it sounds, especially after my morning in game.<br><br>The following screen shots are the beginning of Aspos tells to Dovelyn.<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://users.erinet.com/25570/eq/log1.jpg">users.erinet.com/25570/eq/log1.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>The log in the fourth picture below came on at 9:03:20 AM PST as her log below the pictures will show. This tell came around 9:00 AM PST. <br><br>At this same time Brumpy was on the RTA.<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I also never tried to justify what happened, but it did, and as a member of SoT i will do what it takes to make amends...<br>What everyone is missing here is that most of us really disagree with what happened, people have left us for what happened, one of my best in game friends left us over this... -Brumpy 3-24-02 9:00:08 AM PST&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>Are you good friends with Asmog? If my post here is an example of the chaotic directions SoT members may go at the same time are you sure THIS is the only matter causing anyone to leave?<br><br>Brumpy has in my opinion been mainly sincere and sympathetic since the early hours of the morning as well.<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;who are at the end of the day still just human beings... Leaving SoT would seem to me like being a rat jumping off the sinking ship, it's not an act of honor&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>This is not the view to me of a guild even being close to united with any member sending tells to pick fights while you are showing compassion.

How can one justify picking a fight with someone claiming they don’t know what happened with so much info being put forth and no alternate story other than what SoT posted early on?<br><br>I also think if he had read any of Dovelyns post she does not go along with any crowd though she does sometimes agree with popular opinion.<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://users.erinet.com/25570/eq/log4.jpg">users.erinet.com/25570/eq/log4.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>If we post something your going to respond and we are going to deal with it is whose policy?

I haven't harrassed any SoT members personally. I posted my opinion of what I have read. '<br>[Sun Mar 24 11:04:52 2002] Taking a screenshot...<br>[Sun Mar 24 11:05:09 2002] Aspo tells you, 'you have taken no responsibility, that was a flame with no merit'<br>[Sun Mar 24 11:05:29 2002] Aspo tells you, 'you don't even know what happened, how can you make a post, that is the lamest thing i have ever heard, funny how so many people do it'<br>[Sun Mar 24 11:06:49 2002] Aspo tells you, 'heh, you know its funny, i have talked to about 10 people, only one of them knew anything, that really tells me something'<br>[Sun Mar 24 11:08:02 2002] Aspo tells you, 'and you know, i will talk to everyone on the list, because i actually care about my guild'<br><br><br>The following issues bother me.<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Aspo tells you, 'you have taken no responsibility, that was a flame with no merit&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>No merit? The posts from leader/officers/members of SoT today say otherwise. Again Brumpy was making his post at the same time. This seems like two very different directions for a &quot;family&quot; or guild to be going at the same time.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;[Sun Mar 24 11:05:29 2002] Aspo tells you, 'you don't even know what happened, how can you make a post, that is the lamest thing i have ever heard, funny how so many people do it&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>I see nothing funny about any of Dove's posts nor too many of the others on the string about the rage incident. &quot;Dont even know what happened&quot;? Well imagine the confusion while on at the same time viewing the other posts from SoT members showing opposite views. The question is how can your spend your in game time sending tells to someone you don’t know like this and consider yourself dignified?<br><br>Asmog goes on to mention that only one of the ten he had talked to so far knew anything. The fact that your really sending these tells at this time to this many people boggles me. To further add your going to continue to talk to all on the list because you care about your guild only seems to provoke not solve any issue. Are you actually implying Dovelyn cares not for her guild? I bet the fact that she was offered and guaranteed admission to SoT AFTER she got her res stick with LoM but being loyal refused would shock you wouldn’t it Asmog? This is how Shernot worded it to her and I less than two months ago.<br><br>How does all of your words to Dovelyn coincide with this post by Nyca not long after?<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I, like many of the rest of SoT, haven't posted up to now, cause we were asked not to, by our guild leaders. Between guilds, flames never solve anything, discussion does. A mistake was made, one that I was a part of. Nyca 3-24-02 10:13:11 AM PST&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>There is that keyword discuss. Is Dovelyn the one that Asmog is supposed to be discussing this matter with? Does she bear any weight? I imagine that if SoT fixed the matter and her view changed she would post it with as much vigor as she &quot;flamed&quot;. These tells however only seem to further distance her from seeing light in the tunnel.<br><br>Now my logs. This is my most personal part of this post and I have taken your threat below into consideration Asmog and have a few things to say to you before you &quot;ruin my reputation&quot;.<br><br>To begin I tell people often I am putting them on /ignore then do not. It does humor me usually when they talk anyway, I am a sucker for a good insult and I like to log all comments though I don’t respond. I sent the first tell to Asmog this should be noted. My first tell was in response to his starting comments to Dovelyn. You will notice how I phrased my first comment to him as he had phrased his to her. She asked me not to send him a tell but my anger boiled at the gall of it. <br><br>Asmog, I have gone far out of my way to help members of your guild. That may sound impossible to you but I have. If you will recall Nappani a halfling Rogue who pulled your corpse several times one night in the Hole during the Kirn/keeper camp you were doing while your crew did not have anyone online with a CR rogue there. I also filled groups with you there for the Rat man guard (for your epic I believe it was) as well as a few other raids. I was complemented for being of help and knowing the zone well even by you. I have helped Galactis (sp?) getting a robe there as well as other instances. I did these acts in admiration and respect for your guild tag as well as enjoying being of help to someone. <br><br>I do not &quot;flame&quot; and it isn’t my practice and I personally resent your tone above all of this especially over this matter. Warrick from VoLS hates my guts, I ain’t to fond of him either. We don’t &amp; haven’t flamed each other for our differences we are content hating each other just fine. Tkara his wife had Ragefire in SolB before Dovelyn, we were waiting for next. VoLS was also waiting again after us if able to get him. At no time regardless of past feelings of any type the thought did not even occur nor would it that we should take the mob if they cant kill it when it pops or 10 hours after if that the case. Nor did they even seem to consider any similar action, resentment for Dovelyn or not. We even logged on alts and offered to help with Naggy &amp; Rage when it popped for them. Sure if it had sat up for 10 hours we would have been frustrated, maybe even made some demands to let us find them some that could help but we still would not have taken the mob. That is how we are and it seems in retrospect it is at least close to how your guild leader and officers wish to be portrayed as well.<br><br>Below is my log:<br><br>[Sun Mar 24 10:57:14 2002] You told aspo, 'Hey nice KS keep up the BS. Whiner, quit your guild, stand up for what is right or conclude you are right but grow up and take it back to the boards or are you afraid to post because of ill gotten orders?'<br>[Sun Mar 24 10:57:19 2002] You told aspo, '/ignore'<br>[Sun Mar 24 10:57:20 2002] Aspo tells you, 'hahah'<br>[Sun Mar 24 10:57:39 2002] Aspo tells you, 'real fast message than ignore, try not running away from things'<br>[Sun Mar 24 10:58:02 2002] Aspo tells you, 'nah, i don't post, because RTA is bs, it was *meant* for flames'<br>[Sun Mar 24 10:58:48 2002] Aspo tells you, 'so tell me, do you know what really happened? or are you just another tool going along with the crowd'<br>[Sun Mar 24 11:00:34 2002] Aspo tells you, 'i see just another tool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i'll remember to tell everyone that when i ruin your reputation if your going to put me on ignore and not respond to your own flame'<br><br>Ok, yet in a post from Shei on Champions board says:<br>&lt;blockquote type=cite&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&quot;The members there and the eighty others who have a Spirit of Tunare tag above there head were going on what I said, just as they have for the 30 months the guild has been on the Rathe. For them to hold any responsibility is wrong, and the fault is mine solely. Furthermore the continuous harassing tells they are getting, many who were not even online at the time need to stop.&quot;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br><br>And the tells coming FROM SoT members that werent online at the time? Do they continue?<br><br>So again, I ask the leaders of SoT what IS in fact the story? Is this how it will be from now on with half of the guild making up for actions while the other half commits further offenses? Is ruining the reputation of those who have an opinion posted going to be the in-game response tolerated and accepted by SoT? If not what will be done? What will be next? <br><br>I take things in and I make as clear of an opinion as I can that best helps my game enjoyment and others. I don’t consider my posts a flame nor any of the flames a valid excuse for this behavior. I personally see it as blight to what good is being attempted by others and believe it to need prompt attention. <p>Ilyan Treewind<br>58th Season Magician<br>"Elven in nature, naturally I am an Elf."<br><a href="mailto:ilyan@naturecraft.net">ilyan@naturecraft.net</a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127388">My Magelo Profile<br><a><img src="http://users.erinet.com/25570/eq/ilyan57.jpg"><a/></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthundaron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thundaron</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/24/02 2:35:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=466.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: If SoT is sorry will they stop the harrassment in tells?</span><hr size=1> Duplicate removed<br><br>As far as advice, as brumpy said, basically ignore him and report him if it continues, sot leaderships feelings on it have been posted now, if members don't want to agree with it they can but feel free to take actions against them. <p><center><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Thundaron</b> <BR><i><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">60th Warlord of Aries <BR>Husband to Nycah <BR>Co-Leader of <a href="http://www.spiritoftunare.com">Spirit of Tunare</a></i><br><b><i>"At my signal, unleash hell." -

I have been one of those people on the Rathe who has been sick to death of all the SoT flames.  I have only responded to one previously, and my response was something to the effect of &quot;This got old a long time ago. Don't you guys have anything better to do with your time than follow around another guild taking screenshots?&quot;  I did not respond to this incident until I had seen evidence from several guilds (none of which really had any reason to lie), including more than one posted log.<br><br>My conclusion as to what happened is the right one, as far as I can see.  I see no one that refutes that what happened Friday was wrong.  Even members of SoT feel that it should not have happened the way that it did.  I'd like to know exactly what I don't understand about &quot;the truth&quot;.  If you know it, post it here.<br><br>I will go on to say that I have not and would not send harrassing tells to SoT members over this incident, not even ones who were there.  In game is not really the place for that, IMO, unless you are Trompen or someone else directly involved.  I posted my opinions here because this is the place for it.  Likewise, if you had a response to me, you should have posted it here.  I find it laughable that Shei is asking people not to harrass his members while at the same time his members are pulling random names of the flame boards and logging in game to harrass them.<br><br>Early on in the flame thread, I suggested that what we all wanted to see was a public apology by SoT and for them to make amends to Trompen.  It appears that this has/is being done, and I do have respect for those who are trying to make things right.  <br><br>Asmog, you lost respect for me? When did you ever have respect for me?  You may not believe this, but before this incident, I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> did</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have respect for SoT and you.  I have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> never</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> jumped on the &quot;SoT is the Evil Empire&quot; bandwagen.  Yes, that includes now.  What was done was wrong, and everyone knows it, even those who don't have the courage to post.  All I ever stated was that it should be fixed, and that I was disgusted by the logs and the feeble attempt at rationalizing what was done as OK.<br><br>Some people are doing the right thing, and they have regained my respect.  It is hard to admit when you are wrong, even when you may not totally agree with the &quot;degree&quot; of wrongness (I know some SoT members still see the situation slightly differenly from everyone else, but still feel bad about it).  You've lost my respect, however, Asmog.  You are a hypocrite.  You are committing the same &quot;sin&quot; you accuse me of... jumping on a bandwagen without knowing the facts.  In the past, I defended SoT the many times I heard them disrespected in game.  As such, I don't appreciate you lumping me in with &quot;SoT haters&quot;.  Your actions and the recent actions of some members of your guild have only made me wonder if there was merit in so many of the other flames which I previously ignored. <p><p align="center"><img src="http://home.austin.rr.com/fianna/Dove.jpg"><br><font face="arial" size="1"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=26803">My Profile</a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthundaron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thundaron</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/24/02 3:38:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=466.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: If SoT is sorry will they stop the harrassment in tells?</span><hr size=1> No SoT leadership does not advocate this kind of behavior and i have asked that tells regarding this stop and have asked asmog privately to no longer say anything.<br><br>All i am saying is that i cannot keep members from saying what they want, and is why i am saying feel free to report any that are abusive because they are doing it on their own not with our blessings. <p><center><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Thundaron</b> <BR><i><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">60th Warlord of Aries <BR>Husband to Nycah <BR>Co-Leader of <a href="http://www.spiritoftunare.com">Spirit of Tunare</a></i><br><b><i>"At my signal, unleash hell." - General Maximus</i></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uroggulbuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 345<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/24/02 5:59:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=466.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: If SoT is sorry will they stop the harrassment in tells?</span><hr size=1> Gee golly whiz, I'd say something here but apparently speaking your mind gets you (and your guildmates) put on the no rez no port list that some people keep. <br><br>If you dont like what *I* say, that's fine.

ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  some ppl just dont know where to draw the line. they think by disbanding from a group with an SoT member they'll be noble, sadly they do not realise that guilds are made up of individual people, and you aiyanna, are a nice and friendly individual who does not deserve to be treated that way. ive only read like half of all this stuff cos really, i didnt feel it was any of my business. dont get me wrong, what those 15 or so i dun remember number of SoT members did was wrong, very wrong, and it upset me they behaved like that too, but that doesnt mean that good people like Aiyanna, Shernot and Galactis or other good, uninvolved members should recieve ill treatment because of that.<br><br>for those people treating all SoT members badly just because their mates did something bad.. put yerself in their place. how would you feel if yer mates did something bad and then people gave you bad treatment for being friends with them.. how would you feel!? not VERY NICE I BET. so think before you act. there are many good people in this world, good people who dont do bad stuff who are friends with people who did something bad. dont treat those good people like dirt.<br><br>btw, sorry if grammar\spelling sucks.. someone made fun of me for that a while back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img
