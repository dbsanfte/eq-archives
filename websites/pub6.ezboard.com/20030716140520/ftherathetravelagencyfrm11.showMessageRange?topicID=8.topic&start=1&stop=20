<br>
I would like to offer a counter proposal to the BB rules (which I think no one is overly happy about):<br>
<br>
Because the minimum number required to post a raid basically make the big brother rules a moot point, lets track the individual epic items instead.<br>
<br>
For example: the following is the warrior epic quest components:<br>
<br>
1) unjeweled dragon head hilt - lake rathe<br>
2) Diamond<br>
3) Black Sapphire<br>
4) Jacinth<br>
5) Damaged Dragon Head Hilt<br>
6) Ball of Everliving Golem (fear golems)<br>
7) Giant Monocle<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  A keg of vox tail ale<br>
9) A Block Of Perma frost<br>
10) frozen goblin heart<br>
11) 2 Rebreathers <br>
12) Ancient Blade (Queen of Chardok)<br>
13) Tiny Lute. <br>
14) Green Dragon Scale (Severlious)<br>
15) Red Dragon Scale (Nagafen, Talendor)<br>
16) Maestro's Hand (Maestro)<br>
17) Spiroc Wingblade (Spiroc Lord)<br>
<br>
From this list, there are only 2 rare drops needed from the planes, the golem ball (which can be done at any step, including last) and maestro's hand (which has to be done before the the Spiroc lord)<br>
<br>
Therefore, my proposal is this - we make a list (forum) for each class that is moderated.  That list will be a first in first out que with whoever has the other components on top of the list.<br>
<br>
With this scenario, ANY warrior with red and green dragon scales and the ancient blade can sign up for maestro's hand.  Once the spiroc lord is dead they can sign up for the ball of golem (ok - that won't happen because of how common it is).<br>
<br>
I believe (with the proper spin) would be accepted by most guilds.  It does have an inherent benefit to the current epic guilds because they are the only ones that can acquire the dragon scales.  It does not exclude the small guilds either.<br>
<br>
The rule I propose would be to replace the BB rules:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> To use this calendar, guilds must agree to honor the epic item list.  The lists track who is furthest along in their epic weapons quest and have all other possible components.  Guilds agree to contact the next on the list and give allow them to loot the epic item because the same curtsy will be returned.<br>
<br>
An epic item list will exists for each class that requires components from the plane of hate and plane of fear.  Players can sign up for the next epic item drop when they have all other components.<br>
<br>
The intent of this is to not &quot;take&quot; items from guilds killing the gods in the planes.  The intent is to maximise the number of epic items entering The Rathe.  Every player on the Rathe has EQUAL shot at an epic item with this system because ANYONE with the other components will be placed on the list.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><TABLE background="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/backg.gif"><TR><TD><IMG src="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/elawndarhead.jpg" border=0></TD><TD><P><font color="white">      "You will never become a Knight at this rate"<BR><BR><BR>"Me 'barsh.

<br>
There is already enough problem communicating with people about which guild is the big brother and how THAT works.  setting up lists for loot is just a horrific logistical nightmare.<br>
<br>
And it also guarantees a widening gap between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' on the server.  Just imagine the howling from people who go on a raid with their guild, kill the Maestro, the hand drops, and a_random_warrior is brought up, loots &amp; leaves.<br>
<br>
I don't like the rules rewena posted (about needing permission from other big brother guilds to join friends on a raid), but if it is acceptable to the people who will be impacted by it (ie, the BB Guilds) i'll accept it.<br>
<br>
Really, as far as I'm concerned, the Big Brother details of how it works should be up to the calendar admins and the big brother guilds.  It doesn't affect me at all.  But to completely change the epic loot rules so that people who do the work &amp; manage to luck out and get the loot don't even have a shot at looting it is going to simply foment hatred for people perceived as 'uber'.<br>
<br>
And I wouldn't support that system.  I'd quit going to the planes before I'd go up with my guild, clear to maestro, kill him, and then let someone loot the hand while we rez our dead and get ready to move on.<br>
<br>
But this thread should be about what the big brother guilds want to do, and how they want to handle big brothering and epic looting &amp; guesting on raids if you're in a BB guild.<br>
<br>
my brief take:<br>
<br>
guesting - fine by me.  you have friends, use 'em. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
bb - 1 week rotation per plane (fear/hate), noted on calendar.  ideally have someone chat up the raid leader as the raid starts and give them contacts/backup contact info.<br>
<br>
Penalty:  If a god is left up / bb not called in, the raiding guild loses posting rights for two months.<br>
<br>
2am exception rule:  If the BB guild is called in, they will immediately contact and work with the next-day raid to notify them that the god will be coming down, but there may be some over-run on the time.<br>
<br>
It is more important that the god go down quickly than someone has their 2am cutoff time respected.  This can be REALLY problematic on the weekends, i realize.  Tradeoff:  If any non-epic god loot drops and the god is killed after 2am PST, the god loot goes to the next-day raid.  This is to encourage guilds to call in big brother early.  Additionally, if the next day guild has enough people, ALL loot that drops after 2am goes to them.<br>
<br>
Or ...<br>
<br>
BB assistance has a cutoff time of 3am PST, but only for purposes of killing the god.  After 3am, everyone packs up and goes home, and tries again tomorrow.  Any incident like this will be reviewed by the admins/BB representatives to determine if it was just poor luck or if sanctions are in order.  For a late-night call-in attempt that is too late to bring the god down, i suggest a maximum sanction of losing the next raid in that plane only.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if a Big Brother guild is listed as being 'on call' for a week, and fails to have the manpower available to take a god down in a timely fashion (ie, you only have 10 people on, everyone's in bed or on a trip or whatever), then that guild loses their next months' BB rotation slot.  If someone calls you in and you can't do it, that's just as bad as not calling you in.<br>
<br>
But anyway, whatever the epic guilds decide to do for managing/handling epic rotation, I'll respect it.  It's really y'alls job to figure it out and handle it.  The rest of us are just here to come screaming when we can't kill cazic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I would say that taking the God down is the first priority, and in most cases staying a little bit past 2am PST will not effect other people's raids.  However, if the God is killed after 2am PST then the normal god loot goes to the next day's guild. <p>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

The guild that had the day prior did all the work to get the path cleared to call in the BB to finish up. This would also discourage people calling in the BB altogether.<br>
<br>
Last night I was with LOM and they are a very capable guild. Some unfortunate trains occured, and caused mass CR. <br>
Everyone has a bad day so I donot fault them there. I do think that the BB should have been called in by 1230am pst since Draco wasnt killed till about this time.<br>
<br>
The BB is made to insure that the GODs go down as soon as possible. Not to make sure loot disemination is even and equal. That is an impossible concept to even concieve of.<br>
<br>
If a guild invites members from a BB and they recieve epice pieces whats the problem? Under the current rules the current BB guilds already have a better chance at epic loot then any other guild. While this chance is slim it is a reward not a mandate for there service in such a capacity.<br>
<br>
People wish to argue that KEG got this or BOTS did that. I say if everyone is following the current rules all is fair. Last night there was a BoTs member in fear who offered and epic piece that he had for the ability to loot the shisshar head. Now isnt this what KEG was accused of doing? Useing bribary and etc...to get more epic loot? Well first KEG didnt do that, 2nd I see ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with tradeing things to get more epic pieces from guilds who do get the crack at the god.<br>
<br>
This is called a barter, no one looses out both gains, and nothing goes to waste. This is the primary concern here that nothing goes to waste. Yet people cry wolf because a 6 man team made such a large impact in a raid. So they must be there to BB <p>Vincecross Dhark'baen

<br>
1 - If your guild is on a raid and things go badly, that's a shame, but 'a lack of preparation on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.'  There should be a penalty for going past the 2am time and leaving the god up.  If you're not willing to risk it, call in the epic guild early &amp; often.<br>
<br>
2 - it acts as a way to ease the minds of the next-day raiders who might see a god raid going past 2am as infringing on their time.  If they get all post-2am loot, it may make it easier.<br>
<br>
But I honestly agree with Morty.  I don't know how really 'necessary' the epic guild rotation is.  especially with the new posting rules which make almost every posting entity capable of taking a god down.<br>
<br>
But I do know that from a political/diplomatic standpoint it is necessary because without it certain powerful guilds would attempt to filibuster the calendar system again, and nobody wants that.<br>

In an ideal world it would work, but not here.<br>
<br>
How about this for a compromise: if a god is up - instead of a 2 am pst deadline, if a god is up the deadline is extended to 5 am pst.  If a BB guild is called in before 2 am then the scheduled guild gets the loot as the BB rules state.  If a BB guild is NOT called in by 2:00 am then the BB guild &quot;owns&quot; the plane for the next 3 hours and does not have to give loot to the scheduled party. (In other words, the deadline will be extended if they ask for help only - otherwise we give the god to the BB guild.)<br>
<br>
(Hell, this is a controversal idea for a number of reasons, but it will make the BB guilds happy, prevent gods from being wasted and have as minimal impact as possible on the next day raid.)<br>
<br>
I support the 1 week BB guild rotation.  New BB guilds should get pushed to the end of the que.<br>
<br>
I am somewhat infavor of the BB guilds not being allowed to go on other raids.  I personally wont vote for or against that idea - the BB guilds should decide that for themselves. <p><TABLE background="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/backg.gif"><TR><TD><IMG src="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/elawndarhead.jpg" border=0></TD><TD><P><font color="white">      "You will never become a Knight at this rate"<BR><BR><BR>"Me 'barsh.

It would have helped the guild(forgot which guild this happened to) who lost him one night, then stayed late to make sure he wasnt left up a couple weeks ago. From what happened with KEG and BoTB, it appears we need to go into detail about the rules so there can be no manipulation in the future. IMO its the only way to make the Calendar legit, and stay in place for a long time. I will do my best to help hammer this out, but the guildleaders need to understand that there will be consequences when breaking rules also. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufoladen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>foladen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/26/01 2:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New way to do the Epic Calendar:</span><hr size=1> no way to the 5 am pst deal. weve already had 2 violations in the past 2 weeks on time. that will just make it worse. i agree with stygar if by 11 eastern or (9 pst) you arent taking down or buffing up to take him down, call help with that diety. most guilds dont require a bb to assist on that but the ones who do need to either follow the rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uemilsinclair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/27/01 3:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New way to do the Epic Calendar:</span><hr size=1> copying my sugestion from flames to here<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :O --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":O"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> K<br>
<br>
This is what i was gettin at:<br>
<br>
How sure are we that BotB could have killed ct in the alloted time?<br>
<br>
LoM was extremely confident they could kill ct in teh time given, and a few mistakes occurred, causeing serverwide outlash on them for not calling bb. Bots had made a trade with LoM, to loot the shisshar head. But, in leiu of my feelings on the 6 friends loophole, 6 friends did not enter.<br>
And they didnt finish up on ct in time, and angered a bunch of folks.<br>
<br>
Do i believe 6 lvl 60 bots could have made the raid successful? possibly, probably, but no way to know for sure. Judging from how close they were, i'd lean toward yes.<br>
<br>
Do i believe that taking out the 6 high level keg members from the BotB raid could have had the exact same results at Lom? Possible, probable, but no way to know for sure. Again, i ask had BotB ever killed ct completely on their own? If they have, soley by themselves, consistently then it weakens my argument; however if they never have, or have one time by the skin of their teeth, then it strenghthens my agrument - in effect keg bb'd botb, and took mfh's place that night.<br>
<br>
Again, in principle, the callender is made to share planar loot amongst the multiple entities on an overcroweded server. Again, the bb epic rotation was created a) to ensure gods were downed promptly, b) the rotation was set up to ensure some even form of distribution amongst the epic guilds.<br>
<br>
If a non bb guild can kill a god completely unassisted, then for all i care they can give the ct skin to jobabar if they want, or to a friend, or bank it, or whatever. But if they cant, then they are abliged, by rules, to ask for help. The burden of proof is on them. Not on speculation. Not on a bb guild claiming how easy ct is, how he can be snared, yawned, feared, etc.. <br>
<br>
Did keg/botb break a rule? No. <br>
Should keg/botb be punished? No.<br>
Do the rules need to be ratified? ABSOLUTELY.<br>
<br>
My input on bb/friend rules:<br>
<br>
If a non bb guild has fear/hate on god day, and they wish to give out epic items to members in bb guilds, the bb members should wait outside zone. Imo, this proves, beyond a doubt, that bb was not needed, therefore removes all suspicions of using loopholes.<br>
<br>
It should be illegal for 6 bb members to enter a plane when a god is up, using the 6 friend ruling, because many believe, including myself, that 6 high level vetrans can actually make or break a raid.<br>
<br>
This clause should apply to trades as well. If a bb guild/member negotiates a trade with a non bb guild, the recipient of that epic item should, again, wait outside the zone until the item is obtained. This will prevent suspicions/skeptecism, and will still allow for generous gestures to friends, while also allowing for the bb rotation to take place.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, if a gift/trade is made, AND no bb members assist in any way, i do not feel that the looting of the item(s) would represent a 'slot' in the bb rotation - because it was, infact, an unassisted gift/trade.<br>
<br>
Gimme your thoughts on this. I took 2 days to try to think of a reasonable solution/suggestion. I'm curious to see how the community responds. <br>

<br>
I would agree with this.  However this is just going to promote individuals dealing with friends and working on trades, making the entire BB rotation kind of an afterthought. Which I think it should be.  It shouldn't be about the loot, it should just be to ensure that the God isn't kept up in the likelihood of a server downage, and all is lost. I know we have had many more opportunities to go in and loot epic items than we have done.  Are you sanctioning this now Emil?  That if a KEG member has a friend in a non-BB guild, that can take down a God with no KEG in the zone...that we can have our member waltz on in and loot the item, as long as they stand outside the zone?  Somehow I have a very hard time believing we won't see Qwai and others screaming at the top of their lungs on the board if *their* guild was up for BB rotation that night and KEG has a member waltz in and out with an epic item.  <br>
<br>
I say just scrap the rotation, and let the individuals deal with their epics.  I know Kelton just needs the Shissar head, and has for awhile.  Making this known and talking to different guilds I am sure that you will find a guild willing to accomodate.   <p>"Half of the harm that is done in the world is due to people who want to feel important" - T.S.

And Stygars times are about right. With a combination of the 2 ideas we may be able to repair and appease everyone to one point or another.<br>
<br>
Stygar I must commend you for a well placed argument and suggestion  for a repair to the current system rather then condemning it. <br>
<br>
So to reiterate what I think is good here are the ideas I see and would support :<br>
<br>
Draco/Maestro  must be dead by 10pm PAC, if not BB must be called in<br>
If Draco/Maestro is dead by 10pm PAC and you donot forsee CT/inny being killed by 2 am , aslong as the BB is called in prior to 2am the time limit will be extended to 5am pac(I would think maybe 4am would be better but 5 is reasonable) and all former rules are applied.<br>
<br>
If the BB guild is not called in and God is still up at 2am the BB guild up on the rotation has the right to zone into fear clear whatever mobs are nesscesary to kill the god and keep all loot, the former days raider looses all Rights to the planes at 2am and the next day raid should be little or none effected by anything the BB does except for a friday CT/Inny clearing , but in wich case haveing a Raid start at noon PAC would still not effect a raid that badly.<br>
<br>
As far as Invites from epic guilds. I see no problem at this point with 6 invites. If lets say guild A didnt have the ability as some claim to clear CT and invited 6 members who were friends from Epic guild_01 could this dramatically change the balance? Debatable. But under circumstances lets say they invited 6 members from NONEPIC guild_01 who have probably the same capabilities in fear as Uber_01. They would give the same supposed balance change would they not?<br>
<br>
I also see no problems with CIW/Bots/KEG/MFH ETC.... haveing 6 members in Fear at every god killing as long as they were invited. If the guild gives them Epic pieces thats thier right to, But restrict access to a plane totaly from Epic guilds accompanying friends is totaly wrong. Its as wrong as UBER_01 going to kill Trakanon and running over Uber or NONUBER_02 who are in place to kill trak.<br>
<br>
Trades are also acceptable. In conclussion to the last paragraph basically there is NO FAIR way to distribute loot. There IS a fair way to distribute chance and ability to. If Keg is good at diplomacy etc.. or if they are underhanded Dirty scoundrals, eitherway if they get what they need its fair. BOts , CIW, MFH etc... Have the same capabilities as any other. If they choose not to explore these options should Keg or some other entity be punished?<br>
And YES all those guilds have diplomatic individuals who could arrange things as such, its wether or not they CHOOSE to use the tools they have. <p>Vincecross Dhark'baen

The guild trading the item should have to kill the God alone in order to &quot;possess&quot; the item to trade it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=61&stop=64>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=8.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=8.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.threadControl?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm68">Current World Events<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm69">Elemental Planes</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11>Guild Representatives Forum</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
