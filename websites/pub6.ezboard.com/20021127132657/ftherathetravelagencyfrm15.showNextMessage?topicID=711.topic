Obviously some guilds don't go that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Keepers of Oak expressed interest in killing VS to all of KC before anyone from S4H had let any interest in the mob known. Now, I was assembleing the force required to take out VS. Next thing I know a train (to include VS) forces everyone out of the zone out. This is where I discovered S4H enmass at the zone in. I immediately told the zone of DL that KoO was going to attempt to take out VS. Then all hell broke loose and S4H basicly ignored, both in repeated tells, and in general conversation.... that we were attempting to take out VS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once all this is done... S4H claimed that VS had been spawned. Even if it was spawned... S4H still took out a mob they knew full well another guild had every intention of takeing out. I do believe when SoT did it to Trompen for Ragefire, that was called KS'ing. Regardless of if Ragefire is handled somewhat differently by the RTA, VS also had been in the same situation as RF was.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sorry about this S4H, But you don't screw people like that and expect to get away with it. Regardless of if Ragefire is handled somewhat differently by the RTA, VS also had been in the same situation as Trompen and his kill as well. Regardless of if the mob had been 'claimed', or if it was camped, what your guild did was rude and unjustified on this server. Shame to you. The scarey part was you actually tried to justify your actions. There is no justifiction for your actions like that, especially on The Rathe. None. I have lost all respect for your guild, and as such I personally am judgeing all your members from this incident.<br>
<br>
You guys never knew that was a VSR until well after you had KS'd it.<br>

that was lovely, vitt. and SoO are nice people, i never said they were not,  i never had any grudge against them. <br>
<br>
when VS is up, sometimes more than 1 guild comes for him, and it becomes a race. yes SoO was at kc first, but we engaged first, same thing happened last night when aegis got all there members there before we did &quot;even when i claimed him first which doesnt really matter&quot;, we didnt post on RTA and yada yada, we moved on..<br>

I believe Venril Sathir is a race mob, so first person to get to him and kill gets him. Though once 1 guild has <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ENGAGED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and the other guild tries to KS it, that is a KS. <br>
<br>
Even though S4H saw you preping, i'm pretty sure a few of them knew it wasn't your mob unless you already engaged.<br>
<br>
I believe the RTA has tried to force a rotation upon VS, but it hasn't worked out so he has been dubbed a rotational mob.<br>
<br>

We engaged first.  <br>
<br>
It was the spawned VS, and we gave the 2 stones on it to the person who had turned in the item to spawn VS.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I didn't read all your post, because we discussed this all at the time, when you tried to equate Ragefire to VS.  Ragefire is not VS, and the rules for the two are not the same.  I asked you to review the recent Kelorek'Dar discussion, which I guess you did not do.<br>
<br>
This VS belonged to the guy who spawned him, and congrats to him.  If it had been the real VS, we were still in our rights.  VS is a race mob, and we engaged first. <p><center><a href="http://www.swordsforhire.com/" target="_blank">

What happened does suck, but it is the way VS works.  This is the way VS has always worked.  Pratically every guild that has taken down VS can relate, and the only thing you can hope for is that you get to him first next time.<br>

Here are some quotes out of my log file (I always have my log'ing turned on, its fun to have a record of your entire life since lvl 1)<br>
<br>
To start with, lets deal with who trained him to zone.  I've already said that at least one person in S4H was part of the effort training him away from the zone.  Take a look at this:<br>
[Sun Aug 25 20:45:43 2002] Greym says out of character, 'vs to zone'<br>
<br>
Greym is a 49 ranger in the guild Secret Order of the Pheonix.  Not in anyway ascociated with S4H.  (Now I'm not saying anything bad about Greym here, he was probably just an innocent bystander trying to get away from a rampaging lvl 55 flying lizard.)  It is convienent that you didn't notice the name of this phantom S4H guildie Aiyanna, just that he had a tag.  Uh huh, right.<br>
<br>
Then there is this statement:<br>
[Sun Aug 25 20:50:19 2002] Vittorrio says out of character, 'you cant claim VS'<br>
<br>
But, but, I thought KoO had claimed him, and we KS'ed him from them.  Well, I guess we didn't do anything wrong.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, just how do you know that Demi meant every word he typed?  Do you know him, or have known him in the past?  Maybe there is some history that would explain why he gave you that tell?  Maybe it would look differently if we had some context about what he had been saying to you.  After all, I'd bet Vitt really didn't mean for me to use what he said how I did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujasmannasapphireskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JasmannaSapphireskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/26/02 1:57:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=706.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: KS'd</span><hr size=1> BTW - Navox was the d'ick who started every other rumor when the EW stuff went down. Completely trashed 3 peoples reputations because his friends wanted him to. So really, i have great reason to be upset with him and KoO.<br>

Altantos is Aegis's new Epic wizzy! grats Altantos on the 4.5 second fight with VS, too bad Druid legs dropped.

While there were a few comments that might have been better left unsaid running around the ooc line, most of the S4H members present were very polite and not in any way confrontational.  We tried to take VS, failed.  They waited until we had CR'ed, they tried to take VS, failed.  Later, Aegis did complete the job, but noone was trying to KS anyone at any point, on either side of the fence.  <br>
<br>
We are however quite pleased with our shiny new epic wizzy, grats Altantos.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
