You get all beligerant with me and play &quot;boy scout&quot; when I say that you and Ddeath could be the same.  Now you admit that you did do the ripoffs of which I alledged.  <br>
<br>
Ok, let me check... yep, just as I thought.  The game is still the same fun for me despite your weak insults.  Oh look, some scum doesn't like me.  I'm moving forward.  There was a time when you pretended otherwise /smirk<br>
<br>
Before I even got to the bottom of the post I knew this was Tyrants posting.  The comment about Jaamon was the same you made on our message board.<br>
<br>
Glad to see that you got the monkey nutz to finally admit you are a loser with a capital &quot;L&quot;.  Maybe it was the Monkey Scouts you were in instead of the Boy Scouts.   In an evolutionary theory you can become a boy scout in a few million years.  I'm sure you'll never be a man though.<br>
<br>
I think I figured out why you are so angry though.  I'd be pissed at myself if i couldn't even make it in a fantasy world <br>
<br>
Oh, and he already said he quit several days ago on our message board.  So his two weeks has already started, and there was a Nater sighting in bazaar just a day or so ago.  Boy how time flies.<br>
<br>
It's priceless that you posted on our board how IF you were 65 and had 20 friends you would gank every rot mob you could.  Funny part is even in today's game you can't make it to 65 or get 20 friends.<br>
<br>
And in closing might I point and LOL@you<br>

 beligerant, thats the first time someone called me that, thanks<br>
loser? well maybe, but not a capital L ... more like full caps, but hey. Your a dick<br>
<br>
that was probably some other little dick playing nater, i actually did quit eq a week or so ago, and nater is someone elses, but still hes a dick, so he can burn. yes i cant make it in a fantasy world ... well its kinda funny.. because i dont want to, lmao .... i'd rather play my first person shoots, diablo 2, warcraft, etc ... ill just read fantasy books to get my fill.<br>
<br>
yes and if i was 65 i would .. if i did still play .. and i do / did have 20+ friends ... but most were lil pussies and would be afraid of being blacklisted by a bunch of cock suckers. laugh all you want ... and ill sit here and laugh at you playing a game online 6+ hours a night.<br>
<br>
btw, kath ... i look forward to having some fun with you on this thread ... <br>
<br>
yes i am an eagle scout btw ... and im a good guy in RL and online, to my friends ... but dick lickers like you ... well you can burn in hell.<br>
<br>
oh and if i played as much as you ... i guess i could get 3 toons to 65, but i think my life is worth more then that<br>
i dont base my accomplishments on a game, srry.<br>
