<br>
I am just posting this to inform and discourage the events of a peticlular character. Ddeath, defrauded me of 9,000pp for 60 casts of Sacrifice. After the event took place I was asked to meet him in PoK bank. I zoned from the Tunnel in WFP to PoK and waited at the bank. Several mesages in the context of &quot;one minute&quot;, &quot;Be right there&quot; and &quot;OMW&quot; were said and all of a sudden....Bam he geos LD. Ok, well ppl go LD all the time. I continued to wait 30 more mintues checking repeatedly with &quot;/who all Ddeath&quot;. Nothing.<br>
<br>
Today(Wed) I finally got a hold of him, and we arranged to meet later. Now wasnts convieint for either of us. Well hours later, gettin all kinds of run around We set up to meet in Bazaar. He then ignored all tells after about 10 mins. The Screenshot link below is for the sake of &quot;Educational Purposes&quot; I accept the fact that I have been ripped of and do not expect the money back, but to show you that he is a person NOT to be trusted. He openly admits to ignoring  me and ripping me off.<br>

Shoulda asked for the money up front, but hey then he would be the fool in the other direction. This kinda thing is the risk anyone takes when they buy/sell something that doesn't involve the trade window (MQ's, essence emeralds, CHARACTERS).  If you engage in such a transaction, you should be prepared for the worst to happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 1360<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 10:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1395.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://a.domaindlx.com/Gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: BEWARE/ CAUTION</span><hr size=1> first suggestion, in your photo editing program (even mspaint will do) chose 'save as' instead of 'save' and file type 'jpg' instead of 'bmp'. It will cut that shot down to 1/10 the file size and save you bandwidth costs and let people with slower/dialup connections view it without giving up.<br>
<br>
Secondly, ima sorry to hear that. Normally i'd say to hire a guild necro or one from a reputable guild, simply because you have some level of recourse that way. No good guild wants to be associated with a scammer and will often toss and blacklist such, making respected guild necros a safer bet for this sort of thing.  Most will only want a couple EEs in return.<br>

Tyrants denied playing Ddeath within the last couple months claiming it was a &quot;friend's&quot; account he got from someone else.   I happen to believe otherwise.  First, Tyrants happened to be online very shortly after Ddeath wasn't online last night.  I wasn't actually checking for Tyrants being online but happened to do a /list for the trade channel and his name was second from last on the list.  I was actually looking to see if Ddeath was in that channel.  About 2-5 minutes had passed since I had seen Ddeath near the bank in PoK.  Ddeath was no longer online at that time.<br>
<br>
Secondly, Tyrants was a guest at a raid as he has been applying to DHG.  I saw Ddeath at our meeting place for the raid.  It's not an exclusive spot, but not a place where people just wander or hang out usually.  Then Ddeath was not there at that place and Tyrants was there shortly (few minutes) afterwards.  Those two things are too coincidental for me to believe otherwise without some really strong evidence to the contrary.  <br>
<br>
There is no doubt, even admitted by Tyrants, that he played that character some time before.  I had had conversations with him.  He used to play Wyatt and Nater and was a member of our guild many months ago and Rathe Nation prior to that.  He was /gr from DHG because people were using his characters that we didn't know and there was potential for some problems.  Under the name of Ddeath he had asked to be invited back to our guild.  He has since applied as Tyrants as well.  <br>
<br>
So even at the remote possibility that the person I knew as Wyatt, Nater and Tyrants isn't the person that was playing Ddeath when he burned people, the fact still remains that any of those characters could be played by a fool.  <br>
<br>
And if it adds any credibility to the screenshots, they were posted within several minutes of the conversation taking place in /ooc not leaving much time for any kind of editing. <br>

The channel name is not the same one used all the time.  A channel name is picked  and announced in /gu when we are collecting names of who is going to be there.<br>

I can truely say I hate you. <br>
1. I have played Ddeath in the past, I have even been on him twice in the last 2 months (for rezzing on CR). But I am NOT Ddeath. There are at least 4 people that play that account that I know of.<br>
<br>
Yes when I came back to EQ I played him for about 2 1/2 weeks until I purchsed my own account. <br>
<br>
Also I am the ONLY! one that plays my account, no one else knows the s/n or password.<br>
Your assumtions of making me out to be Ddeath are shit.<br>
You can think anything you want about me in game and RL.<br>
Tyrants holds a good reputation has many friends, and has never &quot;scammed or ripped anyone off&quot; <br>
<br>
Nor have &quot;I&quot; ever done that on another char or acct.<br>
In RL &quot;I&quot; have never scammed anyone or ripped anyone off.<br>
<br>
I am an Eagle Scout of the Boy Scouts of America<br>
I live by words such as Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Kind.<br>
And you assocating me with people who would do this kind of stuff just makes me sick. You are the kind of person who makes me not want to play this game because you make assumations.<br>
<br>
Also, &quot;I&quot; do NOT associate with those kinds of people such as Ddeath. I only know 1 of 3 more possible people that know the info for Ddeaths acct. And he DOES NOT play Ddeath. Nor do I associate with people such as this in RL. <br>
I have to appologize for my rude language I used with you in game. But that is the thing that makes this game no longer fun<br>
It drives this games past what it really is &quot;a game&quot;<br>
<br>
Personally I dont really care what you call me or think of me, thats your opinion, your entitled to it. I'm not going to try and change your mind. But when you take your &quot;assumtions&quot; and opinions and take them to the RTA in order to (as you say warn people) but basically to ruin my rep, then thats crossing the line.<br>
Good friends I have in DHG will stay my friends, because they know that I am a good person.<br>
<br>
And if this is a way to attack Circles End (which you have a personal grudge agaisnt) you might as well drop it now and find something better to do with your time.<br>
<br>
As for Jaamon refer to the above<br>
I am proud of who I am in game and in RL.<br>
<br>
Yeah I won't ever play Ddeath again after hearing this, 1. I think people who do that kind of stuff should burn in hell 2. Because I dont want to be accused of all the actions made under Ddeath.<br>
<br>
I just hope everyone else who reads this post can believe the truth in that I DID NOT nor HAVE DONE ANYTHING such as what Ddeath has done, NOR was I playing Ddeath.<br>
<br>
Also about you /GuildRemoving my past toon Nater (Wyatt alt). I did NOT let anyone else play my acct while I played. I had canceled my acct. quit playing (nater was stuck in PoF). so hense I was unable to /GR myself or let anyone know. When my friends little bro had asked if he could have the acct. for the gear. I Agreed gave him the info, let him have it, and told him to /GR if he ever got on Nater. (Wyatt was guildless btw due to the fact i was not longer playing him)<br>
<br>
Also NO ONE has or has ever HAD the info for Tyrants acct. NOR ever will. All Actions made on Tyrants are my own.<br>
<br>
Everyone is entitled to believe what they want. I just hope they are able to see the truth, that was I have said it correct.<br>

My bandwidth bill thanks you for your courtesy.   <br>
<br>
You &quot;hate&quot; me?  You called me a liar in our conversation, you called me names not repeatable in this section.  You have yet to even provide any information that indicates a falsehood I stated.  You said I lied about the reason Nater was /gr.  Everyone online that day many moons ago heard the guy loud and clear. &quot;I'm not Nater but am just going to get him out of fear so I can strip his gear&quot;.  You admit someone else had the account.  It's why Nater was /gr.  He (the unknown person playing Nater which was not YOU) was talking about doing something that would not be courteous to whatever guild might happen to be raiding at that moment.  <br>
<br>
So exactly what have I done here?  I asserted the thing I KNOW to be true.  That is you have played Ddeath.  I stated my beliefs on the fact that you have recently played him.  Last night you said &quot;I haven't played him in over 2 months&quot;  Today it was &quot;over 2 months except for a couple of CR&quot;.  <br>
<br>
You say you don't associate with people like that.  I can't say with certainty that you do.  One has to wonder where you got login information though.  Just show up in an email box one day and didn't hit the spam filter?  /shrug<br>
<br>
Of the things I knew for certain I stated it as such.  For those things that I &quot;believe&quot; to be true, I stated it clearly as a belief and included the facts that caused me to believe that.  None are lies.  Which fact have I stated is a lie?<br>
<br>
I also didn't lay claim that there was only one explanation possible.  I stated that it was my belief that you played both and stated why I believed that to be true.  Look at my post.  There is a paragraph that starts &quot;So even at the remote possibility...&quot;  It is the statement to further indicates I don't know &quot;for sure&quot;.  I still don't know definitely, however you have clearly shown behavior I would not want around me or in our guild.  I can see where the first thing that doesn't go your way is a reason to call names and fly off the handle.  <br>
<br>
You asked to talk to me.  I didn't blow you off, I was willing to listen.  You start out calling me a liar and make me out like I've got some personal vendetta against you.  You then went downhill from there to name calling.  One of us was prepared to have a mature conversation, the other acted like someone had knocked them off the monkey bars or butted in line at tetherball.<br>
<br>
Fact is, you are too much drama for me even if you are completely innocent.  No one told you to play someone else's account.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jobtdp>Job tDP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 8:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1395.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: BEWARE/ CAUTION</span><hr size=1> Please folks, do not push this issue to moce this to Flame Central.

It seems your hinting that i am acting like a child? And YES i have reason to believe you have a personal vendetta agaisnt me. 1. When I first came back and wanted to join DHG you gave me the run around for almost 3 weeks, avioding me, and any type of confrentation 2. wtf do you get off coming onto the RTA with your ( im pretty sure Tyrants = Ddeath ) when you have no idea? Take you assumtions elsewhere. Also, you stated that I let others play my account. Well I don't, thats why I called you a liar. I DO NOT let others play my account. I have given away one acct. But at no time before i canceled it or gave it away did anyone else play it. And I have a brand new account. Obiously you came on here to start something, because if you did come on here to &quot;warn others&quot; then you would have had &quot;FACT&quot;. Thats like Saying &quot;Hey, someone trained us!&quot; (and then randomly picking a monk out of the zone and accusing him). Personally I find it absolutely obseard (sp) that you would make an assumtion like that. <br>
Yeah I did copy/paste ... I felt that post explained enough from both forums.<br>
I just think that if someone doesnt know &quot;for sure&quot; they should either try and find out for sure, or wait until there is substancsal evidence. (period)<br>

A short time ago I made my guild leader aware of some circumstances concerning our last hate raid. <br>
<br>
The night of the hate raid Tyrants was grouped with Dwandra and I ..I wanted to try killing otters in CS, Ty didn't think the 3 of us could handle it since Dwan was a couple of levels below us.  He offered to bring on a necro that he had access to, and use it to pull one for us to try, on his one attempt at it he died.  I knew Tyrants had signed up on our board to go on the raid although I was not sure he would be allowed to go since he was tagged with another guild. Tyrants knew the preraid channel because I told him what it was, I also told him the port up spot in pok.  I am the reason Tyrants was playing Ddeath that night.<br>
<br>
Tyrants is not Ddeath, he does not pay for the account and has no primary control over who has access or does not have access, and we do not always like how our friends behave all of the time.  This whole situation is certainly a good lesson to learn, that allowing people to use your account is not a very good idea.<br>
<br>
With other people having access to the account and ability to play Ddeath, it bothers me that that Tyrants was named as a link to Ddeath, since no one can really be certain who was playing him at the time, and now he will be the only one to face any fall out from this.  I think everyone has a responsibility to make absolutely certain of all the facts and *proof* before naming other accounts and players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tyrants@therathetravelagency>Tyrants</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/25/03 10:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1395.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: BEWARE/ CAUTION</span><hr size=1> Thank you very much for coming on here to help clarify Ciraele, still havent had a chance to talk to you in game. but im sure we will get to that.<br>

Well not my definition of mature anyway.  Maybe one might consider putting forth some reasoning why my belief is wrong as opposed to calling me names and say I'm lying and so forth.<br>
<br>
Let me be clear.  No where in my post did I indicate that I knew for sure Tyrants was playing Ddeath at the time of the incident.  Let me be clearer to those that might be misled.  I have no &quot;proof&quot;.   I stated what I knew to be factual, and what I BELIEVED to be true based on existing information.  It is entirely possible that someone besides Tyrants was playing Ddeath at that time.  It is also possible the inverse is true.  I don't KNOW.  I did, however, post what I think, and the reasoning behind those thoughts.  <br>
<br>
Based on the information presented is it so far fetched to come to the same conclusion presented?  Doesn't seem that unreasonable to me.<br>
<br>
Ciraele, whom I do trust and has a valued opinion, has presented some information in a rational manner.   Someone should take some lessons.  It goes a lot farther than &quot;you're lying and are a *@($*7 #*$&amp;&quot;.  She sways opinion much more than your foul mouth and anger.  <br>
<br>
If I had some vendetta to levy why would I, less than one week ago, be helping you with information needed to become a member of DHG?  Why did I let you come with us on our raid?  If I disliked you, or had some grudge, you would not have been along in our raid.  If I firmly didn't want you in the guild I would have said &quot;no, go away now&quot;.  I have no idea what you are talking about in avoiding confrontation.  First I didn't know you were &quot;confronting&quot; me.  Secondly I told you from the very first tell you sent from Ddeath that there was an issue to be resolved before you could rejoin.  That being the fact that you had let someone that we didn't know have access to your character(s) in the guild.  You can say that's a lie or whatever.  It is fact (see rhetorical question below).  You can offer whatever rationalization you like, the facts are still the facts.<br>
<br>
If your defense presented is comprised of the fact that I only posted here because I have an axe to grind then you've posted it.<br>
<br>
You can assert that I'm a liar all you wish.  Here's facts<br>
1) someone other than you logged on to your character and said as much in /gu<br>
2) Nater was /gr because someone else was using the account.<br>
<br>
Which of those two facts are not true?  This is a rhetorical question.  I don't need nor expect an answer.<br>
So you chastise me for posting some facts and some conclusions without proof and in the same post incorrectly call me a liar?  /chuckle<br>
<br>
If you have something for which you want to flame me, click on over to FC and have at it.  As people before have stated, let this remain non flame material.  Or you can have the last word here if you like.  This is my final comment on the matter in this thread.<br>

If it wasn't you, hope you at least learned not to trust other people with things like this. No one knows who's playing it, so if you weren't, from this some people are going to assume it could be you, which is a reasonable arguement.<br>

I had to tell you several things up to 3-4 times! Because after answered your question you'd ask the same question again. Get it though your thick skull the first time. Second, after we were done talking you kept trying to antaginze me in /tells and asked what was the point of our convo, etc etc. So this is exaclty what i said<br>
Tyrants tells you: Let me sum it up then<br>
Tyrants tells you: FUCK YOU DICK HEAD<br>
and that was the very last tell i sent you, though you sent me continus tells (im not sure how many because i put you on ignore after the first two)<br>
Btw you did lie. I told you how you lied, you just refused to listen to reason.<br>
<br>
Next, YOU were NOT the person who let me come on the hate raid, you actually said NO! You just had failed to notice that Sald put me in a group. Afer pointing this out to you, you finally said ok (wow something actually got through). Also I did not ask nor push the applying back into DHG. 1. I am already a memeber of Circles End and no longer want to join DHG 2. You brought it up, I just said ok, though I never said nor implied that I would apply for DHG again.<br>
<br>
Why do you keep bringing up the /GR Nater thing?<br>
1. Yeah I gave him away after i canceled the acct.<br>
2. I already stated that I COULD NOT /gr him myself because he was stuck in PoF and i canceled my acct. and if you wanna go the distance, i had already deleted EQ.<br>
Please tell me those arent the only &quot;facts&quot; you have O.o<br>
<br>
Think what you will, but as long as you do. I will say (truthfully) you are WRONG Sir!<br>
<br>
Aerik, fyi: The person who usually plays ddeath (which isnt much during the usual school year) is on the weekends. Hes the owner of the accts.
