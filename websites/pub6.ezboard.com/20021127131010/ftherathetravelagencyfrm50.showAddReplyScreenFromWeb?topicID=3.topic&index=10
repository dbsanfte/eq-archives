most of the people that were posting defined &quot;legend&quot; as someone who helped them out when they were lower level and enhanced their enjoyment of the game.<br>
<br>
To me that would mean people from the first year of the game, but to others it might mean people that just started playing 1 or 2 years ago.<br>
 <br>
Even people that just started playing less than a year ago still get the thrill of entering a zone they have never been in and looking for the people they had grouped with the night before.  The game may no longer be &quot;magical&quot; to you, but to many who are just starting the game it is.<br>

I am not so egotistically inclined to do so. However...what, then do you define as a legend?<br>
<br>
Dictionary.com defines it as such:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Usage Note: Legend comes from the Latin adjective legenda, “for reading, to be read,” which referred only to written stories, not to traditional stories transmitted orally from generation to generation. This restriction also applied to the English word legend when it was first used in the late 14th century in reference to written accounts of saints' lives, but ever since the 15th century legend has been used to refer to traditional stories as well. Today a legend can also be a person or achievement worthy of inspiring such a story, anyone or anything whose fame promises to be enduring, even if the renown is created more by the media than by oral tradition. Thus we speak of the legendary accomplishments of a major-league baseball star or the legendary voice of a famous opera singer. This usage is common journalistic hyperbole<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Perhaps we're using the wrong term then since its &quot;common journalistic hyperbole&quot;.<br>
<br>
To me, personally, a legend is someone from ages past...that no longer plays perhaps (more likely doesnt than does) and is a warm memory. True..there could be  people that influenced the newer generation of players today, that are still active and only a year or two old....maybe we should have called the thread &quot;Heroes&quot;?<br>
<br>
I will also agree that the game can be magical for those new to it. I'm sorry if I indulged my nostalgia a bit...but the earliest times of EQ when it *just* started were poignant. Hell..we *grew* up *with* the game. As it shook out the kinks early on, alot of us were there. We (the older community) played a fair role in changes that took place.<br>
<br>
That isnt to say that the current community now doesnt...Safehouse has plenty of bragging rights where that is concerned.<br>
<br>
All I'm saying is that *my* definition of a legend would be someone from the earliest possible times, when it was *hard* to get 50 fast since you had no one higher to help you with it then....twinking was non existant for the most part...those were the things I meant. <p>Karas LightStrider

What the thread turned into was, there was this guy who buffed me at level 11 - TWICE, and then did it again at 12, and 13, and OMG at 42 too! So like Karas said, it turned into a Heroes thread, instead of Legends. Karas's legend as I recall it was Vishivia, and I think that very few people on the server now a days would recall her, but you bettter believe I do. At the time, 99 or early 2000 latest, there was a whole ruckuss about her, and how she trampled over people to level an account so that she could ebay it. This was before the time e-baying accounts became 'illegal' .<br>
<br>
Vishivia was a Legend to me. Unfortunately, most people on the server now-a-days have not played since then, so the only legends they can describe are those from their day. A present day legend would be someone like Mudder, who is renown - even legendary -  for being a funny-arse guy. The problem of the thread was people posting heroes and not legends. <br>
<br>
To ME, a legend would be the guild Aeon, the uberest guild around, before BoTS was really super (mind you, back in those days, BoTS = EVIL to most everyone) Noble House, and Silver Blade were still just that, and Aeon was running around being - big. Of course they split, but that was only after I quit in 2000. <br>
<br>
If I wanted to list a hero it would be Auluvien. He and I romped about Lavastorm when it was still an untamed land, and Fire Elementals were pure evil super villains. He slowly outleveled me - a lot. By the time Kunark came out, he was already 50 with full exp, and the co-leader of my guild. He continued leveling towards 60 post-kunark, and as I was a druid, and so was he, I envied him, and learned about all things druidic from him. Now, to most, that name probably means squat, but he was a big name for ME.<br>
<br>
The whole legends thread I THINK was supposed to be people the server could agree on as widely known and respected, revered, feared whatever. Bannisher or whatever his name was/is would qualify. See, although I never met the guy, I know who he is/was and what he did. He is a legend. <br>
<br>
Anyways, I got to be somewhere to do something, so I hope I cleared things up! <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif"</img> <br>
