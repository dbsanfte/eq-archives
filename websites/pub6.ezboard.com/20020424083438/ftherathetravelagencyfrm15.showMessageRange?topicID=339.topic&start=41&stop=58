You too refuse to grow some and post on our boards.  Mayhaps I should reopen your post about how you &quot;gave&quot; the password to a guild only area to your RL &quot;no longer guilded&quot; friend.  You admitted to giving it to him.  Allowing him to post under your name was the same difference.  In both situations, you GAVE access to an area you knew was members only.  In such, you showed how much integrity you have.  The only reason the post was closed was because you were getting lit up left and right about how you can't be trusted.  And your only defense was, &quot;he is a RL friend&quot;.  Do you work at a bank by any chance?  If so, hell I would love to become your RL friend.  Pass me some information bro.<br>
<br>
I saw your application and thought about letting them know that integrity is not in your vocabulary, but I figured the hell with it.  Let them learn the hardway, we had to. You are such a good friend to your RL buddy that you stayed in a guild just to spy for him.  That's admirable. Somewhere. Surely.  Too bad that you can't get your facts straight from your little composition notebook.  Let me help you, in chronological (use a dictionary) order:<br>
<br>
Fact:  Un-named person posted a whine/bitch/gripe about why they were on their way out.<br>
<br>
Fact:  I moved it off of the Public section to Guild Only section.  As it pertained to the guild and not to the general public, this is where it belonged.<br>
<br>
Fact:  Multiple responses were posted by members and Un-named person.<br>
<br>
Fact: Un-named person posted that they were through with us and would not be return to the boards so we could do whatever we wanted.<br>
<br>
Fact:  Topic and thread was locked because it was moot to keep beating a dead horse if said person wasn't going to be coming around (as they declared).<br>
<br>
Fact:  Password to Guild Only area was then changed as un-named person was no longer in the guild (note the order here).<br>
<br>
Fact:  YOU re-introduced the topic under another post in Guild Only.  <br>
<br>
Fact:  Responses were posted.<br>
<br>
Fact:  You gave access to this section to allow un-named to post under a topic YOU brought forward after they were locked out.<br>
<br>
Fact:  You were banned (for breech of trust) and topic locked.  Password was then changed.<br>
<br>
So, either learn to take better notes, or learn to read time stamps.  And point that finger at the image you see in a mirror because you are the one that restarted the thread after he was banned.  Up until that point he had access to retort.<br>
<br>

Do us all a favor and post a pic of yourslef here.  That way we can put a face to what is really sad but too funny.<br>
<br>
You can keep the fact that I swear as a victory to yourself.  I could care less.  You can keep staring in the mirror telling yourself what an adult you are.  Knock yourself out.  I'm sure your mom reminds you all the time with a frosty Yoohoo and a fruit snack.  Stop sniffin her panties in the bathroom you freak.<br>
<br>
I doubt you understood a thing I said anyway since all the words I use have more than one letter.  Maybe get your mom to read it to you.  She must have helped you write your last attempt at a flame because I did notice a try at improvement.  Too late and too bad.  Either way, you don't exist anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utanyis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanyis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/21/01 5:29:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=339.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: real sad but too funny</span><hr size=1> K hais.. i wasnt gonna post again after leth mentioned he opened it up, but priz wanted to continue here, just found that kinda odd. one of the officers of vols(prizmo) continuing to post here, but another encouraging to post on vols boards...   and Xwar, man you dont know what ur talkin about, just cause you dont see it, does that mean that other people arent bein talked about? lol, k man, think that way if u want.  i got no beef with you and I'll leave it at that. im gonna end this on my behalf, drag it out if ya want, but i got nothin more to say<br>

This matter is solely between VoLS and Tanyis (add any of his supporters).  I'll start one for you on the VoLS board since no one has done it.<br>
<br>
VoLS this thread is a result of you locking him out of your boards (for good reason if it is true).  You brought this on yourself even though you didn't realize it.  Some people have to vent if they are locked out so I can understand why Tanyis posted here.<br>
<br>
VoLS, stop posting here and if Tanyis replies.  If he does then it is his attempt to defame your guildtag.  He has no control over his suporters but ignore it if they post.  Phallic go there if you want to whine go to the VoLS board.  <br>
<br>
I will say once more that none of the parties involved has a bad rep so why drag white horse through the mud?<br>

Yes this is pretty much the same thing as giving away the password but like I said I knew the consequences.<br>
<br>
Was this the reason Kit closed the post or was this your reason. You did not close the post so your reason is bias Leth.<br>
<br>
I see you also like to get around to boards good I like that bet you wish you knew what other guilds said about your's wouldn't you.=)<br>
<br>
My only defense was that he was my RL friend uhhhm Leth I used that on this board...did you actually read my post on the VoLs board I think not.=)<br>
<br>
Now im a KBG Leth. I happened onto that post in the private board when another said person clued me in. I was never a spy. Before I read the post and said person told me that this was his post that was ORIGINALLY posted under general forum AND in NO WAY did it flame VoLs if you have read it which I highly doubt right now. It was said person's post telling the guild that he will no longer be with them. He was walking away without starting any waves yet one of you guys had to go and move his post and flame him.<br>
<br>
Lol multiple responses &lt;------ multiple flames  I think=)<br>
<br>
Fact: Un-named person posted a whine/bitch/gripe about why they were on their way out.<br>
<br>
Now i really question if you have read said persons post. Said person never whined...bitched....or griped. He never told you up front in the post why he was leaving VoLs Leth. Plz go back and read the post because what you have as FACT is fiction friend.=) <br>
<br>
So, either learn to take better notes, or learn to read time stamps. And point that finger at the image you see in a mirror because you are the one that restarted the thread after he was banned. Up until that point he had access to retort.<br>
<br>
Lol you are wrong my friend he tried, password was changed. So take some of your own advice.=)<br>
<br>
Too bad that you can't get your facts straight from your little composition notebook. <br>
<br>
Leth did you really read said persons post? Im not going to call you a lier I just think you need to go back and read it because there were more than one fictional statement in your above post.=)<br>
<br>
Ahh Priz you make me laugh but im done with you now go back to the dug out.  &quot; Next batter Leth step up.&quot; =)<br>

So i guess I have to take that non fiction stuff back because if you look at it in your perspective you may have been telling it as it is. To tell you the truth I dont think I ever read Tan's posts so anything  I say on his behalf is totally bias on my part. I hope this clears up any misconceptions.<br>

It was taken to this forum because it was Tanyis's only other option. The fire has been started and it takes more then &quot;moving the post&quot; to put it out.<br>
<br>
As for this situation I have no comment to date, other then the fact that Tanyis has been nothing but beneficial to LoM, both as a fighter and as a friend to all. <p><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<br>
I guess first of all I would be considered a &quot;Tanyis supporter&quot;.  Tanyis has been nothing but a great friend since before he joined LoM and since then has been great guildie!  He even loaned my bf a Lupine Dagger after he completed the first part of his epic...and to me people who do nice things like that &quot;just because&quot; are what makes this game.  When I asked Tanyis why he was leaving VOLS he just told me he just wasn't happy with what was going on in the guild and stuff, never bashing anyone.  So I told him &quot;hey, come join my guild...we all think u are really cool!&quot;  So he did. =)  I guess what I'm trying to do here is /vouch for his credibility as a person and a player and I really don't think he would be here to cause trouble on RTA.<br>
<br>
As for Phalynk (or Phallic which Haisama so lovingly calls him, which I have mentioned to Phal myself LOL), while I don't convey posting on guild's private forum after someone has left (especially after what LoM recently went thru), bashing someone who leaves a guild for whatever reason is uncalled for..especially when that person can't defend themselves. Unnamed person also happens to be a VERY good friend of mine and has always been there for me in-game or just to talk to when I needed him.  This person is also NOT a &quot;drama queen&quot; he is one of the most laid back, non dramatic people I've ever met.<br>
<br>
I guess there isn't really much else for me to say....I could say more...some really mean stuff that I have &quot;heard&quot; but I'm not going to fall into the gossip...I am just going to support my friends and be there for them.  I have alot of very good friends who are in VOLS and they happen to be very happy there, friends that I unfortunately haven't seen in awhile...but still good friends, so I really can't say anything in opposition or defense of VOLS because I have heard alot of different things from different people.  <br>
<br>
So I guess that's it, not a flame I guess cause I suck at it...just some support for true friends of mine! =)  See you guys all in game! hugs<br>
<br>
Love<br>

As you said, <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   &quot;Like you said this is between Tanyis his supporters and LoM.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I beg to differ.  LoM may have a vested interest in protecting one of its own but LoM as a whole is not involved.  I don't know Tanyis but his name is in good standing on the Rathe.  I have yet to see one post from VoLS that slanders or demeans LoM as a guild.  My statements here were to stop the whining and let the &quot;parties involved&quot; handle it in a civil manner.  To do so in a forum that just gets bad attention is bad press and is not productive to any parties involved or not.  But alas it seems to be an endless cycle of you replied that so I am replying this.  I have friends in both guilds and see no point in discussing it here.  It just drags the names of VoLS, Tanyis, and Phallic through the mud.  If you as co-leader want to involve LoM as a whole then so be it.<br>
