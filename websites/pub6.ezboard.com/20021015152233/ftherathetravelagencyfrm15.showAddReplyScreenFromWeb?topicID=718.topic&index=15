questions by point:<br>
<br>
1. How many people are on the Rathe Server?<br>
- Lots, several thousand.<br>
<br>
2. How many of those people are planable?<br>
- Quite a few.<br>
<br>
3. How many planable guilds are there?<br>
- I don't know the exact number, but there are quite a few of those.  Simply check the planes reservation calander for a list.<br>
<br>
4. How many planable people/guilds run the RTA board?<br>
- All of them.<br>
<br>
5. Do we even like the people who run the RTA?<br>
- For the most part, yes.  Everyone has representation.<br>
<br>
6. Why do we need the, sorry to say, dictator guilds telling everyone else where they can hunt and when? <br>
- If 'all of the people of the Rathe' is considered a dictator, I guess everyone is telling everyone else where they can hunt and when.<br>
<br>
7. Why do we allow these people to tell us when we can camp ragefire?<br>
- Out of fairness.<br>
<br>
8. Why is it ragefire is not allowed to be camped by anyone under lvl 56?<br>
- I don't know anything about this.<br>
<br>
9. Is Rathe so an@l retentive that we tell clerics &quot;don't do your epic cause your not ALLOWED to get it until lvl 56, because RTA says so?&quot;<br>
- See #8<br>
<br>
I don't understand this, we all pay the same amount to play, we all experience the game the way we enjoy it, so<br>
10. WHY!!!! are the people who run RTA telling the server how and when to play?<br>
- Because if The Rathe didn't have such a government, there WOULD be a single guild, or a very small number of guilds (like 3) that would be telling you EXACTLY how/when/where to enjoy your game and they would be telling you to shove your $13/month where the sun don't shine.  Smaller guilds would have NO shot or HOPE of seeing higher end encounters more than once a year.<br>
<br>
11. Is the Rathe made up of a bunch of children who need direction and guidance from other children?<br>
- Exactly the opposite.  It is made up of mature, rational thinking individuals that can see the good and usefulness in compromise instead of greed and immaturity.<br>
<br>
12. Why do we have a rotation calendar? <br>
- To guarantee that smaller guilds have the exact same (fair) access to higher end encounters as the larger guilds.<br>
<br>
13. Why do we have to sign up and why are there rules?<br>
- You sign up to guarantee your rights to access content and so that other guilds will not bully or runover you.<br>
<br>
14. Why do I need permission to go to the planes?<br>
- You don't.  You are free to go all you want.  Just be prepared to be an outcast and unguilded (which means you won't be going to the planes at all).<br>
<br>
15. What are the GM's/Verant views to my guild going to the planes while not on the RTA board?<br>
- Heh... you'd be surprised and it depends on the situation.  GMs have enforced our calendar before.<br>
<br>
No where in the EQ manual or on the server select screen under The Rathe does it say , must check RTA to be able to play the way you want.<br>
16. How is it that you all fight about RF all the time but no one has the balls to say screw the RTA my guild will take it down if we engage first. Then to have whining little babies come running to the RTA/Flame board, just so they can bash someone for playing the game by the game rules?<br>
- You are free to gank Ragefire if you want.  Be prepared to be unguilded and an outcast.<br>
<br>
<br>
17. Why is my guild not allowed to bring more then 6 people from another posting entity guild to my raid?<br>
- This actually has a lot of history behind it.  Basically it comes from the epic mobs that are in the planes.  A group of 60s can clear the planes, in addition to 'elevating' the strength of a guild by a huge factor in PoF and PoH, allowing them to get access status when they would really be wasting everyone's (including theirselves) time.<br>
<br>
<br>
18. Who makes up all these rules?<br>
- The players of The Rathe do.<br>
<br>
19. So can I make an RTA board add a Flame central then start spouting rules and you will all follow them?<br>
- You are welcome to try.<br>
<br>
20. So is the RTA a majority or is it a handful of people telling a few thousand what to do?<br>
- It is the majority.  If you go look at the rotation pages or the reservation calendar, everyone on those lists agree and support the RTA.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me make this additionally clear: It isn't that everyone loves to share because rotations naturally work against humans' natural proclivity to greed.  However, most rational people agree that order is preferred to chaos and that rotations are fair and much more orderly.  In addition, the calendars and rotations let guilds who typically have more casual gamers to plan ahead so that they can field full forces on the days when their turn at a mob is up.  The RTA tries to guarantee that the game is fair for every paying customer by insuring their access to higher level content that would otherwise be permanently controlled by the higher tier guilds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/31/02 6:23:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=718.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why RTA for Rathe?</span><hr size=1> Heh... you know... the first sign of someone who thinks about as far ahead as the end of his nose is evident by that person pulling out the &quot;I pay $13/month too&quot; trump.  I'm glad those people pull those out because they immediately let me know what kind of person I'm dealing with.  These people think only for themselves - i.e. ruled by greed and the lack of logical thought processes.<br>
<br>
Let me give you a 'what if' scenario to explain it more...<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
What if BotS suddenly decided that we all pay at least $13/month each and we now feel that we should kill every spawn that you ever attempt to kill, from the lowliest moss snake to Aten Ha Ra?  After all, it is our right since we ALSO pay this fee.  Since there are more of us paying our $13/month than there are of you, this makes it completely right and just that we should do so.  Tindi'Losi and Noble Blade could also make similar arguments.  I think between our three guilds we could guarantee that you and your guild would never, ever see any content worth continuing to play and pay your $13/month, much less Ragefire or the planes.<br>
<br>
Let me explain it further.  It takes my guild 13 people to kill Derakor the Vindicator, less than 18 to kill Statue of Rallos Zek, 4 to kill Ragefire (and not MB wizards either, although that is also an option), and we can clear PoF with 6.  In addition, we can deploy these numbers on a moment's notice, specifially when we learn that you are starting to head somewhere interesting.  After all, it the rules of the game that we can kill whatever mobs we want, whenever we want, as long as you aren't currently fighting it... and since this isn't a PvP server, there's really not much you can do about it.  Plus, we play our $13/month just like you do.<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Obviously, neither BotS, Tindi, nor NB would ever do such a thing... although this is a 'what if' scenario, it is actually quite similar to the playing environment seen on many other servers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upashun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pashun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 255<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/31/02 7:41:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=718.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Why RTA for Rathe?</span><hr size=1> Damn, I knew I left something out of my post...Gromm explained it all very nicely in his *what if* post above.<br>
<br>
I think it's funny some times when people come on complaining about rotation mobs and the calendar systems...<br>
<br>
Not saying we all should bow down to the top 3 or 4 guilds and feel greatful for any kill we happen to get, but it is because of *them* that there exist sanity and fairness on the server, not the smaller guilds...The power guilds of the times keeps the piece moreso than anyone. Without their constant consideration of each other and the rules, The Rathe would suck major. The names of the guilds have changed over the years, but thank God the respect of each other on this server hasn't.<br>

Try to fit this in your &quot;Deaksun-sized-d1ck&quot; brains (.5 inches or 1 cm in diameter for our metric using folk): The Rathe is one of the few servers that strives to make EVERYONES $12 dollars a month worth paying. <br>

<br>
Our guild is not likely to qualify anytime soon for RTA planable status, for many reasons, mostly because the core members have a different attitude about the game.<br>
<br>
However, I strongly support the RTA system we have on this server, I keep an eye on what is happening so that I can find raids for our guild members who need assistance on planable items and epic peices.<br>
<br>
My guild is not on rotation nor do we have posting status on the calendar, but it hasn't inhibited our play at all. If you are civil to people and helpful, those same guilds you are criticizing will be happy to take you along and help you out to do things you might not otherwise be able to do.<br>
<br>
And I would like to point out that if Broken doesn't like the social conventions on this server, there are many more servers to try out, they all have their own unique social conventions.<br>

Guy has some friends in BoTS and hates the FFA action going on on their server where all the big guilds wipe out the big kills within an hour of spawning.<br>
<br>
With the RTA even though it may seem a allmighty crushing fist, the smaller guilds have a chance at least of getting the mobs rather than being run over by the larger guilds while you are forming up.<br>
<br>
Heck even Vox &amp; Nagafen don't last an hour if someone finds out they have spawned.  Here, they could be up for 10-12 hours or more waiting for guild on rotation to come get them.<br>
<br>
If I'm wrong on some points its because I only have one planable toon and have not had to deal with the specifics with RTA.<br>
<br>
So, in parting.  At least smaller guilds have a chance.  If you don't have enough people on your own to make rotation, talk to some of the other smaller guilds that are in the same boat and get an alliance going.  It works until you have enough force and you make friends in the process. <p><HTML><BODY><center>

And was this post even about the RTA? Or was it just some sort of tricky way to get another &quot;New Ragefire Plan&quot; post up.<br>

Most of your points seemed to be filler questions &quot;how many how much whos what&quot; Then you went into the standard content questions, all refering to ragefire pretty much, then hell why not tie it up with some revolution talk! &quot;Take down the Tyrants of the rathe!&quot; ye buddy congrats on getting no where with your post. <br>

<br>
the *new and improved, triggered Ragefire* requires that a Cleric is at that point in the Quest to finish their Epic.<br>
<br>
IE:  they MUST have the Chardok Note and the Pearl from Sol B.<br>
<br>
The Rathe's &quot;Gentleman's Agreement&quot; asked the same.<br>
