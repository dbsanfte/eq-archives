<br>
That said, there's a good chance I might be leading some dragon raids here and there again in the future.  You will never get everybody happy with the loot rules (WTF, my pet needs CoF plz!), but you can try and be as fair as possible.  Please add your input as to what classes should be included in /random, /lotto, /committee in your opinion.<br>
<br>
Vox:<br>
Crystalline Spear (WAR,RNG,BRD,ROG):  Rogue only to start.  If all rogues have a higher damage weapon (ragebringer) then it's simply show off gear and any of the four listed classes.<br>
<br>
Dragon Bone Bracelet (WAR,PAL,RNG,SHD,MNK,BRD,ROG):  Monk only to start (comparable AC to planar gear, very light weight, others have far superior AC on planar gear).  If no monks need it as an upgrade, all classes that can equip.<br>
<br>
Kavruul's Mystic Pouch (ALL): Monk only if one drops.  This thing is a life saver to monks, whereas it's basically no different than a tink bag to anybody else.  If two drops, one goes monk only, one goes to everybody.  If monks already have (it's LORE), all are included.<br>
<br>
McVaxius' Horn of War (BRD): Ummmmmmmmm.... wizards only.<br>
<br>
Runed Bolster Belt (ALL): Warrior, Rogue, Monk, Paladin, Shadowknight, and <b><font size="4">RANGER</font></b>.  Basically, anybody who will primarily be meleeing during most fights.  I know bards get the shaft on this, because 'they have duel wield', but it just isn't doing half as good in their hands.  If you had double attack and 400 more AC, then sure.  Paladins and Shadowknights don't have duel wield?  True, which means they need that much more damage output to help keep the mobs off the casters (and bards :P)<br>
<br>
Scimitar of the Mistwalker (RNG,DRU):  Does this thing still drop?  If so, Ranger only unless they have superior weapons, then all rangers and druids as it will simply be a toy.<br>
<br>
Staff of Forbidden Rites (CLR,PAL,DRU,SHM):  Who cares?  I'd prefer to let everybody but the clerics go for this so they can all play cleric for a day (10 charges of ressurect).<br>
<br>
Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch (ALL):  Wis and Int casters only, no prejudice between the two, it's far more wis and int than either can get in that slot.<br>
<br>
Warhammer of Divine Grace (CLR):  The necro pet.<br>
<br>
White Dragon Scale (NONE/QUEST for ALL): Bards only (for epic).  If no bards need it then all Wis and Int casters (for the white dragonscale cloak).  The cloak has good AC, yes, but all it's stats are really pointing to a caster.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nagafen:<br>
<br>
Bladestopper (WAR,CLR,PAL,RNG,SHD,BRD,ROG,SHM):  Tough one, alot of people seem to think SHD and PAL only since they don't have duel wield, here is why I disagree.  There are other shields out there that I see on almost every SK or PAL that seriously does 1h that are better than this.  I give it to war, pal, rng, shd, depending on mood and need, rog.  It's got its uses for pulling.  As a monk I'll definitely be swapping in a shield (when I get a certain one :) ) for certain pulls.  I can definitely see a warrior getting very good use out of this.  Open to opinions, of course, or I wouldn't be posting this :P<br>
<br>
Blight, Hammer of the Scourge (SHM):  Ummmmm, enchanters?<br>
<br>
Cloak of Flames - same as Runed Bolster Belt from Vox<br>
<br>
Gauntlets of Fiery Might - (WAR,PAL,RNG,SHD,MNK,BRD,ROG): Monk only if there are monks that don't have these or their epic yet.  Simply put (not including uber velious stuff, duh) these are by far the best a monk can get before their epic.  Other classes all have as good or much better from the planes.  If no monk needs, all that can use can roll, heck, even bards!!<br>
<br>
Gold Plated Koshigatana - (WAR,RNG,SHD,BRD,ROG,NEC,WIZ,MAG,ENC):  It will be rare that your rogues, and beyond them, your other meleers won't have better weapons than this.  If not, rogues only first, then melees only if they are truly poorly equipped, then all who can equip as a show off item.<br>
<br>
Heirophant's Crook (DRU) - Mage pets only plz.<br>
<br>
Orb of Tishan (BRD,NEC,WIZ,MAG,ENC): Another toy in my opinion.  Any who can equip it.<br>
<br>
Prayers of Life (ALL) - Anybody BUT a cleric.  I'd prefer a meleer just for the fun of it.<br>
<br>
Red Dragon Scale (NONE/QUEST FOR BRD,PAL,RNG,ROG,SHD,WAR): Bards and warriors only for epics.  If no bards or warriors need it for their epic, then all who can equip the red dragonscale BP.  Honestly though, this is one of the few items I'd rather not reward to somebody as a play-toy because it's hard for many people to get their scales, would probably just try to give it to a guild leader/officer who was in attendence to dish out to a guild member.<br>
<br>
Selo's Drums of the March (BRD): Clerics only.<br>
<br>
Treasure Hunter's Satchel (ALL): Same as Kavruul's Mystic Pouch from Vox.<br>
<br>
<br>
My big thing here is that whoever gets it plans on USING it.  I was quite disappointed when I did my first Naggy raid with Kraket (just about a month ago), Gauntlets of Fiery Might dropped (a MAJOR upgrade for me), the raid leader had all melees roll even though multiple monks did not have, a Ranger won it, and a WEEK later I saw him auctioning it off in Dreadlands.<br>
<br>
Unless you're a tight group or guild that is taking down dragons for specific rare loot and has to get rid of all the excess stuff, I don't think dragon raids are meant to profit anybody.  Especially in the /random environment, I don't think a ranger, for example, should profit from the best gloves my monk could get his hands on before his epic (IF he ever gets that).  Now I don't know ranger armor very well, if it's common knowledge that ranger planes gloves are AC2 and -7 to all stats, sure, he should get a chance, but otherwise... come on.<br>
<br>
<br>
Opinions please.  Alot of my opinions are based on ASSUMPTIONS about other items available for classes at certain levels.  It's quite likely that I've overlooked many things as I don't know the stats on all planar armor.<br>
<br>
<br>
/EDIT Forgot to add ranger to list for haste items.<br>

<br>
I'm a cleric, I won one a while back. Before every major raid I hand it to a close monk friend of mine.  Fact is, he can keep it in his bag to reduce its weight to zero, and if the raid goes horribly bad, he can rez in a cleric to save us three hours of CR.<br>
<br>
There are other incredible uses for this staff, but the one I mentioned is my primary use for it.<br>
<br>
Staff doesn't have to be equipped to use the rez effect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubishoopugget.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bishoopugget</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=57685510&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 471<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/31/01 10:36:52 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://everquest.estoncom.com/images/bishnut.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dragon loot - opinions please.</span><hr size=1> Hmm, interesting on the staff of forbidden rites...<br>
<br>
Well, either way, the fact that you give it to a monk to use doesn't have much to do with you having gotten it as a cleric.  Anybody could give it to a monk to use... so, in that case, perhaps it wouldn't be bad to reserve those for monks, necromancers, and shadowknights.  Perhaps rogues as well.  Basically, the people that are either going to FD before the party is wiped out, or the guy who is going to hide/sneak all the way back to the corpses after the party is wiped out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uwaladennotestorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Waladen Notestorm</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=7087537&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/01 1:12:23 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.calpoly.edu/~kblomset/headinmouth.jpg height=150 width=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dragon loot - opinions please.</span><hr size=1> Personally, I think bards should be able to win Haste Items (Sure, I'm a little biased, but hey).

They get double attack, we get dual wield.... and if both a non-hasted bard and a non-hasted paladin or SK sit and melee something, neither using taunt or spells/songs, neither will hold the aggro, will bounce back and forth, assuming both have decent weapons.  i.e. it does us just as much good as it does them.... and considering how many bards seem to keep their instruments in the bank instead of their inventory, you can't really say that most bards aren't melee'ing the majority of the time.<br>
<br>
The Bladestopper is the only other piece of equipment I disagree on.... it's a great pulling tool, but I've never agreed with awarding equipment to someone based on its pulling value.  Pallies and SKs are the only classes that use shields with any regularity at that level.<br>
<br>
Other than that, I think you've got it down well.  The bags I've done differently on occasion, depending on how many monks were actually on the raid.  But in general, it should go to a monk, yes.<br>

Originally it farted out a pet with 1 hp or something like that.  The pet was buffable and would stay around until it died.  Hit for 200ish, it was pure disgusting.  The weapon proc'ed this pet.<br>
<br>
The first time they nerfed it, you couldn't buff it anymore.  Then it's nerfed again, and now the pet does less damage, nerf again, pet only sticks around for 1 round of combat.  Nerfed again, damn thing don't drop off Vox anymore.<br>
<br>
My ranger Mandrik used to have wet dreams about that baby.  My one friend Dena actually got one right before it stopped dropping, and the day she let Mandrik play with it once was kinda cool.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sure those are for FA but imo a char 49/52 will prefer a kick@ss Bp or cloak to a step in a quest they might finish in 8 LvLs.I dont talk about the twink.I talk about the *real* ppl who are 52 and dreamt about dragon loot and get their prize taken off by some secondary character who *only misses this for the epic of his main*.Cuz face it : NO 52 NON TWINKED BARD OR WARRIOR WILL EVER MAKE HIS FA.they will do it later but not for now.If i were a SK 51 and a bard would get the red scale cuz *its for his epic* then i would be real pissed.<br>
The bard has time to get the scales until he has his epic(scalekeeper/gore/etc etc...).I would really like an upgrade to my darkforge BP <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
For the white scale is the same problem.Of course hierophant cloak is a better cloak but how many non twinked 52 and less can have a hiero cloak ??not a lot imho.<br>
Dragon loot is not the best loot in game anymore as it used to be but it remains some of the best stuff u can get at the LvLs u kill the dragons.<br>
Hope u understood me cuz my english seems suksuk today~ <p>Talaban

The scales should definately go to those trying to finish their epic quests.  As you said, the dragon loot is so so compared to the other items available today.  This is one of the best shots that players who are unguilded or in small guilds will have for a shot at the items for their epic.<br>

BTW- I agree with you Bish.  Looks good.  I do kinda agree with the others on the Bladestopper thing though.  I'd live with it either way since I couldn't use it anyway, hehe <p>In faithful service, <BR>

Like many bards, I have stalled leveling in order to obtain my scales from the Old World Dragons. I am not a twink and would be at least 3-4 levels higher if I had not deliberately slowed my EXP camping to stay under 53.<br>
<br>
White scales only drop off Vox and Gore and, unless you haven't been paying attention, Gore doesn't die all that much. <br>
<br>
I have completed every other part of my epic and am stuck until I get the two scales. Once I do that, I have plenty of friends who would be willing to help take down the Trak Spawn and complete my epic.<br>
<br>
There is a 52 Bard on the server with her epic, and once I get the scales, there will be another one. <p><p align="center">

<br>
And yes ther scales reserved for warrior and bards epics is a good thing as I made the mistake of leveling past 52 and now I will nto see my epic until everyone in my guild reaches lvl 60 and decides we can try to take Gore down. Bards out there below 53 listen. This is your BEST chance (maybe only for a long long while) to get a white scale....gah not unless you can convince one of the big 3 or 4 guilds to take Gore out for you (good luck on that.)<br>

Armor is attainable in many ways but so far the white scale is Vox or Gore, the red - Talendar or Naggy.<br>
<br>
I have my red scale and need the white.  I started Vox and Nagy raids at lvl 46 and went on every one I could possibly do.  When I got to lvl 52, I stopped leveling for 6 weeks trying to get the white scale.  It was so discouraging to see the white scales randomed off and usually won by a 46 or 47, first and last timer or someone's alt or twink. <br>
<br>
Since the white scale is becoming so difficult to obtain, I would love to see some fair system put in place to see that everyone has a chance.  I'm not the person to do this but would love to see Bish or one of the epic toting Bards/warrior institute a fair rotation system similiar to the Ragefire thing.<br>
<br>
Additionally, whenever Naggy pops, the server comes out en masse to take down Naggy so that Rage can pop.  I think this is great and i'm proud to be on a server that works together to accomplish this.  BUT ....  I can't tell you how many times I sat in the King's Room in Permafrost for 3 to 6 hours trying to get a Vox raid together.  The interest is extremely low and several opportunities for white scales were lost.  Now I know the cleric sprinkler is much more important and valuable to the server than the bard epic, but we need to help our bards too.<br>
<br>
Just some food for thought!! <p>LOVING EVERYONE ... <br>Catraxyla, Minstrel of 54 Songs<br>

I also could not agree with Raventod more. I think any epic related piece should goto an epic. I have been 51 for a while now, and it has been on purpose. At my normal rate i would be close to being a knight by now (55), but for a chance at my epic I had to slow my game down alot. When ever I did I don't get a rezz on purpose! If I die and there is a cleric there I ask for a revive not a rez (they usually think I am crazy until I explain, and they usually can find the spell since it is all the way in front of their book :lol).So I know the pains first hand. <br>
<br>
I would love to join one of your raids. Maybe I will be luck and get a book or 2 so I can play once again and some what enjoy the game. Well we will see.<br>
<br>
<br>
O ya the sheild topic, I won one and then gave my old sheild to a guildmate of a lower level. So not everyone will be a loot hog. But I am sure there are many that will just go sell it :( <p>Thanks,<BR>

Only adds<br>
<br>
1) Raid Leader can only reserve one item, be it book or scale.<br>
2) No bards for COF/RBB, bards rock but they can do things outside melee to cause serious damage.  Plus each dragon drops one Bard only loot item (Dropable too if I remember) and bards are getting dibs on scales.<br>

Scales should go for epics imo as well. I think you would have a much easier time getting a comparable or better piece of armor in the planes compared to the bottle next of getting epic pieces from a dragon. Damn dragon that big outta drop more scales too. WTF?<br>
I think you can make many many arguements for who needs and deserves what. Everyone has an opinion. But I think that if the loot rules are explained before the raid and you have time to decide whether to take part in the raid. Then no bitching after the kill and that's that. <br>
Loot is fun. But so is the process of getting the loot. <br>
My 1st dragon kill and Bij got her epic. That's all the loot I needed last night.
