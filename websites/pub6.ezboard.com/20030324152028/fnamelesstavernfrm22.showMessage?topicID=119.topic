People have long forgotten the sea monkey denied by many other factors that create such disdain and disbelief. Can a person who doesn't believe in the sea monkey be called an atheist? agnostic? Will there be an anti-sea monkey that has its own number, the number of a platypus perhaps? Will the anti-sea monkey actually be a platypus? Or will it actually be a cross-breed of sea monkey and platypus through new genetic research? I always thought it would be cool that if research and cosmetic surgery had gone far enough I could get bat wings attached to me and fly around, and maybe talk to Q and get an animal shaving device that could shave a full grown grizzly in less than 20 seconds. Then I could fly around with my bat wings shaving many pets of many neighborhoods, leaving only their feet to have hair. I would bring howler monkeys from where-ever they are shave them and let them loose like a plague upon major cities. Then we could kill the first born duck-lipped beaver until they let my monkeys go. I could be like a Seamoses. And what of the platypai? Who is it that leads them? Why would they stand for such a creature? How were they lured in to the deception? I have mentioned many a time before there is a plot. Sea monkey wisdom has been hidden and kept away but I have been in touch with the sea monkeys that be. Their words descending from the heavens like tongues of sea monkeys. The wisdom I have always had that has never left. The sea monkey revival shall start soon, there are many that have not forgotten but stayed true the course and remained devoted to the sea monkey and the sea monkey does not forgot, for he will come like a thief in the night. Blessed are the cheesemakers? One day the wisdom shall be revealed to all and they shall be amazed. Even the wombat shall smite the platypai in the name of the sea monkey. I went to church the other day and the pastor tried to rebuke me. I laughed in his face and said I have never been buked before so your power of rebuking has no effect on me and continued on with my sermon of the sea monkey to show that the wisdom was greater than any he hath ever known. And now he follows the sea monkey so that he can remain and what he always wanted to do, first he bukes them and then rebukes them. It is the way it is. He hath seen the truth and understandeth. Let him who thirst go get a glass of water, Let him who hungereth go to a drive-thru, Let him who seeketh knowledge find it in the sea monkey. One day my monkeys we shall rise again<br>

You must read in entirety or loss the true meaning. I like jokes that 4 people or more find funny. I like responses to the sea monkey, I like when people dislike. I like when people agitate like washing machines, it is interesting to watch. I have made sense more than once before and if you read carefully I might again. I would really like it if you contemplated the words I write and take them to heart. The great seven headed sea monkey shall come from the sea and bring a plague of rabid rabbits to make habitats of your lower intestinal tracts. The pain will be unyielding yet it will bring to you the wisdom you have never attained. My words are bestowed upon me by the spirit of the sea monkey and to have the wisdom to understand what it is would be an amazing act sea monkey proportions. The insight brought upon by baptismal by sea monkey would defer the buking you had once recieved. To say I never make sense would be nonsense, to say I am nonsensical might be true but only to the unbeliever. Behold the sea monkey and the power that it bestows. To mock the sea monkey will only encourage it to spew forth more irrelevances that are really words of wisdom if read with proper intent. To ignore it only makes it stronger, to beseech it will only make it laugh, because it thinks the word beseech is funny and likes it. Redemption of lost souls who have not followed in the path of the sea monkey shall come by a parade of sea monkeys and ye shall be made free to enter the world of the sea monkey. Have our paths not crossed before? Have I seen you somewhere? Is there really deja vous or is it really an evil twin that puts memories into your head? All these questions are answered without other questions in the divine spirit of the sea monkey. Is this roleplaying? Are you ready to succumb to the will of the sea monkey. Be at one with yourself and do it twice with a sea monkey. One day my monkeys we shall rise again. <p>Asmo-Child of Innoruuk

I have solo'd whole game. You would think not by choice but it is otherwise. I see the knowledge of the sea monkey has not been bestowed unto thee. I do see that you are a burrolover and they may have something to do with it. Your intelligence in the matters of what sea monkeys are are truely amazing, but apparently you do not know the truth. You have not seen the backs of DC comic books in the 70's, even though you think your wisdom may be great that would be your weakness. And such foul language you use. MAy be there is another who else has been blessed by the wisdom of the sea monkey and you were lucky enough to bear witness to such things, lucky for a burrolover. Perhaps you will become a sea monkey lover before long. It is great to be met with such emotion, I have missed annoying the people who ae legends in their own mind. Perhaps you would be best to give yourself over to ingorance, you would be fighting a winning battle then. My hope is that you continue reading my posts and learn from them and one day be converted to sea monkeyness. Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. Do you think its dumb to get mad at someone who lives 400+ miles away and you can do nothing about it, now theres power boy. I beseech thee all to seek refuge within the sea monkey. I was walking along the beach and only saw one set of footprints in the sand in my time of need, and I asked the sea monkey why did you abondon me when times were bad and he replied because youre no fun when you are whining. I drink my whiskey straight and like my women with sexy feet. Its not too late to repent do not blasphemize the sea monkey or ye might recieve a pre-buking, that would be a precuror to a buking in order for you to be rebuked. The knowledge of the sea monkey has been repressed for too long. One day my monkeys, one day <p>Asmo-Child of Innoruuk
