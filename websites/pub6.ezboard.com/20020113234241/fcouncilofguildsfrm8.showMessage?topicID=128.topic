<br>
Staging Strategy :<br>
<br>
We will be meeting at the secret entrance tunnel where attendace will commence at 5pm PST / 8pm EST. If it falls on a weekend it will be at - 3pm PST / 6pm EST. Attendance stops half an hour after that time.Pls be off anon or roleplay and put an LFG tag on for ease of identification. If you will be late be sure to inform us or post it here or your space will probably be filled by the time you get there. This in no means discourages latecomers, it encourages people to camp at the tunnel. Durring attendance pls refrain from drinking, emote spamming, or talking in open channels as much as possible. All it does is makes our job harder which means raid goes on longer which means you're up later, so dont do it.<br>
<br>
Resists will be a MINIMUM 70 cold and magic unbuffed.<br>
<br>
Attendance fee is 50pp each to go to enches and clerics for stones. When you enter the group pls give the money to your group leader. <br>
<br>
As soon as groups are assembled we will start moving into Permafrost 2 groups at a time. These 2 groups are called bunches. Each bunch is formed of a caster group and a tank group so everyone is safe. Because of how my method didn't work as well as planned from guild speech to the group leaders I will be doing all of this via shout speech.<br>
<br>
Example - g1 and g7 = bunch 1, g2 and g8 = bunch 2 and so on.<br>
<br>
All rolls are based on previous SB rules.<br>
<br>
Once we are all at the Kings Room, ALL casters with Bind WILL bind at the Binding rock. (the one tucked in the corner around the back, you will be shown) I want confirmation from all my group leaders that all casters have bound at this point. Since this is also the easiest time to do it, we will be doing the roll for the pallie book of scale at this time. Loot master will control all lotto's and will keep track of the highest 3 people for the book.<br>
*note* last time the loot master wasn't properly announced ahead of time but will be this time.<br>
<br>
We will then begin to pull the IG's. NO ONE is to pass the flags (you'll see them) when attacking, the mob will be brought to you, not you to them. I will be giving out warnings for passing the flags if you are not a designated puller.  Main assist will be announced the day of the raid.<br>
<br>
When I get the &quot;all clear to move up&quot; signal, we will be moving up to the next room. Stay in this room and dont wander. There are pit traps everywhere and falling down one would mean almost instant death and a very hard CR, so dont wander. Everyone will form up in a U shape around the pull hallway. If you dont know which one it is then wait for instructions and you will be shown. No one is to be in the centre of the ring, all should be back towards the walls. When fighting the giants it is imperative to keep them off the walls. One of 2 things could happen if we dont. 1. the body could fall through the world and would be lost. 2. The IG could gate into Vox's lair at which point we would start to be summoned one by one. Either way not pretty.<br>
<br>
Once these IG's are clear the buff line people will be called ahead up the hallway to start the buff line. If you aren't called foreward then listen to commands and see what is to happen. We are allowing 2 full groups of 53+ers for support and IG control. If you have been called foreward to be buffed dont run back to help kill IG's, that is what our 53+ tanks and extra's are for. Let's get buff line done as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
Buff line coordinator and co coordinator TBA.<br>
<br>
BIND CLASSES - you WILL bind at the end of the buff line. You dont bind, you dont roll. That seems fair to me.<br>
<br>
Vox Strategy :<br>
<br>
Reform groups as quickly as possible upon return. We dont want buffs wearing off so this part will go reasonably quick. Mages are to use Fire pets.(highest dmg versus an ice creature)All other pets welcome and might want to find them an ice resist just in case if you can. *note* - all other pets - meaning ench, necro, sk, Shaman.<br>
<br>
Triage Line - I believe the standard positioning for the triage line is one platform up on the ramp (correct me if I'm wrong) and so that is where it will be unless otherwise stated at the time. Healers are allowed to sacrifice cold resist to a minimum of 45 in favor of wisdom, no lower. If there are several druids, then those over 50 become nukers. This will be said in advance to prep your correct spells.<br>
<br>
On the attack command ( I will do a lead up to it, ex. on your marks. Get set. ATTACK! all in different shouts) there will be only 2 waves of tanks. First wave will be warriors and Pallies. Second wave consisting of all other tanks, will run in 10 seconds later. DO NOT engage her near the doorway. Run to the middle of her chamber and begin fighting her there on the platform. Pets will be held back till the second wave of tanks. <br>
<br>
Tanks are to taunt until she turns on you then stop. Go back for a heal at 50% life or if you are hit by her. Be sure when leaving her that she's on someone else and not going to follow you out.<br>
<br>
At about 60% life I will call casters to rush. For some this is early, for others too late but after Nagafen I believe that if the casters had gone in a bit earlier we might have done that little bit more dmg to overweigh the regen, so casters are in at 60%. IF YOU DIE - mem up your offensive spell (or for healers your heal spell and get back to triage) and get back in there and keep nuking, dont stop, dont think about how many times you died, just get back in there. *note* and no your naked corpse does not poof after 3 minutes, it now lasts 3 hrs.* For every time we (as casters) die, we probably save a tank for another few seconds and that is what we HAVE to do. Mages Malosi and call when it lands pls.<br>
*note* Use fire or magic based spells to hit her. Also, her resistance is distance based, so in order to get a spell off on her you're gonna need to be standing underneath her.<br>
<br>
Enches - You're whole purpose in life here is to Mana sieve as much as you possibly can. As long as Vox has mana she can CH. If she does then I have about 5 seconds to decide if we have enough people left to keep going or quit, so sieve her dry cause I dont wanna make that choice.<br>
<br>
Healers &amp; Casters - If you are OOM - Run in and die, its the quickest way to get mana back and since you're getting a rez I shouldn't hear anyone complaining.<br>
<br>
Now if all goes well some lucky group will get a little yellow message on their screen about exp or something and we will have a chance to laugh over her dead corpse. Exp group looter will tell the lootmaster of all items and then let loot master deal with it from there.<br>
<br>
Aftermath :<br>
<br>
Do not deny a rez, thats a quick way to not get invited back again. As soon as rezzes are complete and not 1 minute before, all lotto's will be done. All rolls are based on previous SB rules. it is a random roll of 1 200. Dont practice rolls or roll twice, its rude, needless and I dont put up with it. (yes I can be a pain but none of us should have to listen to you spout off) If you roll wrong, roll again properly.<br>
<br>
*NOTES*<br>
<br>
I dont think I need to go over etiquet with you guys but we'll be brief about it anyway. Do not swear, emote spam, practice roll or make lewd comments. As some of you may have gathered I am very much against all of those and will be using the baseball method if I see or hear it. I believe 3 chances is more than enough to clean up behavior. If all 3 chances are used up you can be replaced on this raid. Next raid you can try again. Simple.<br>
<br>
We are going to try for at least 10 groups of attackers and are allowing 2 groups of 53+ers who can volunteer for buff line and IG control.They WILL be allowed to lotto since they used their mana or skills for the cause and to deny them would be truly unjust. Just because dragons cap at 52 doesn't mean we cant find a way to include everyone possible.<br>
<br>
If you bothered to read this whole thing and actually made it to the bottom I'm asking you to send me a tell in game just to tell me you read it so I know who to count on.<br>
<br>
The signup list at this point is still open, also, anyone who is the right lvls be sure to ask along and we can see how many people show. <br>
<br>
C ya all on the inside and everyone cross their fingers.<br>

I'm pretty sure that I will be for the rest of the summer.  For some reason xp seems to be slow. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And of course if I'm not, then I can probably find a friendly necro to sac me a couple of times.  I could probably use a few essence emeralds. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Also Lag, you might want to see if Haemish is still sending out Dragon Raid alerts via the bulk email system he set up.  A lot of people probably dont check these boards that often.  I'm at work right now so I cant check my email, but I'm pretty sure I didnt get one the last time we hit Vox.<br>

I've been absolutely slammed at work, was completely wore out from that and my own dragon raid last week, and as a result, didn't check the boards. When I did, 2 days later, CoG went from 7 or 8 to 2nd, and myself from 10th to 4th. Double eek. <br>
<br>
I'll try to send out an alert ASAP. <br>
