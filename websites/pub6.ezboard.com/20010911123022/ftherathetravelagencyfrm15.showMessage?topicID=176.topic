What would you do if your guild was killing a major mob...say like the turtle.. and a guest of yours who was awarded a VERY nice item then refuses to assist your guild with rezzes and such even when the bodies are brought to them?<br>
<br>
Player A (a cleric) goes with our guild to kill the turtle. Player A is awarded the boots that drop.  Two days later, a group of our guild was in a zone where this cleric happened to be and needed assistance with some rezzes. They sent /t's, brought bodies over to him, etc... and he flat out refused to help them.<br>
<br>
Now, normally I wouldn't bring something like this up, but apparently this cleric is making a name for himself.  I know that he is no longer welcome on ANYthing that CoN does, and I would hope that other follow suit..  This kind of thing really shouldn't be tolerated.. I mean, we're a community of people.. MOST (I stress most) of us get along, help each other out when necessary..  Its a shame that there are people like this that will take advantage...<br>

Seriously though, was he busy, or pre-occupied in tells?  I summon ppl if I can it's only mana (oh and a coffin).  But good deeds go a long way if they are remembered.  However I will say a lot of times they are remembered.  Bah I digress.  I think a anyone who can help should.  I always do to people I don't particularly care for even.  Any way bad deeds go as far as good and tend to stick in a person's mind so they he/she will pay in one form or fashion.  Hope thing turned out well despite the non-rez.<br>

The issue wasn't that he didn't have mana, didn't have the time, or that he was in a group, etc.<br>
<br>
Anyone can understand the above circumstances, and they would've been completely legitimate reasons if they even applied here.<br>
<br>
The BIG problem was, he was just simply standing around at the zone talking to friends before and after he was asked repeatedly for resses, and even after the corpses were brought to him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Basically, this would be just like ME (a druid) , going along with your guild in fear to kill a boss, getting awarded the Staff of the Earthcrafters for helping out, and then 2 days later, you or one of your guild members walk up to me at a druid ring asking for a desperate port so you can go get your corpse, and I just turn you away while I stand there BS'ing with the people around me in /say's.<br>
<br>

<br>
Ok i have been getting lag so unreal the past 2 weeks (still continuing atm) anyway, i have been getting bad lag average ping 3k jumps up to 20k ( i was looting my corpse after a rez and it kicked me out of my corpse  once, my rez effects were gone and i was at half mana..thats how long it took)<br>
well ok im running through velketor and i get a tell to rez him when im halfway to village well two things 1. my group had already been waiting on me for close to 5 or 10 minutes and 2. my ping was 3k atm meaning it would have taken me 3hrs to mem ,send tell,get reply, cast, wait, heal repeat....<br>
so rather then do this to my group i just told him no and explained and then he throws the boots that i got back im my face saying &quot;Didnt my guild give you lodi boots&quot; and yes , yes they did and im greatful because of that i got a Donal's helm. but that fact remains that i would be holding my group up and at the time i felt that was more important. <br>
oh and brissen when your gonan flame me ... make it somthgin that actually happend...you knew i was in village and you didnt bring them up there at all  ... you could have, i didnt say i wouldnt rez, i said i couldnt causei was OMW TO V-I-L-L-A-G-E! I mean c'mon anybody who has ever group with me/talked to me know i am not the guy to REFUSE to rez if the bodies are in front of me so if you wanna think that im that kinda guy hell i dont care i got enough friends anyway. +)<br>

<br>
Can you explain how I would know that?  I already said I wasn't there.  The members involved told me what happened and I posted that here.  So if you're going to talk about stating facts, get that right.  <br>
<br>
Second of all, they said you outright refused even when the corpse was brought to you at the zone.  No one said anything about you telling them any explanations other than 'no'.<br>
<br>
And how are you headed to the village, when you were sitting at the zone and the corpse was even in front of you.. I mean, I may just use my rez stick to do rezzes and all, but even a cast doesn't take THAT long... and I know what lag is..<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I've heard nothing but conflicting stories on this, and anything else that has your name involved in it, Shizmo.  Some say you're a really great guy, and then I read other stories (Some of which are in this forum) about how you've caused people to die, flipped out over the fact that paladins in your group were the tanks, and other various facts.  <br>
<br>
<br>
NOW, since you brought it up..  You took a piece of loot from our raid and used it to get something else??  Our loot is given need before greed, and you take it and sell it to buy something else when there might of been some of our own members who would have USED it ????  Now, as far as I'm concerned, you REALLY aren't welcome on our raids.. Its people like you that make nice guilds weary of inviting guests to raids.  We try to include all who help out, and reward them for it, and you go and sell it ? <br>

Well either you love me or you hate me and either you like me as a cleric or not...<br>
for anyone who freaking knows me they know i wont flat out refuese to rez anyone cause i have never done that if the corpse is right in front of me...and yes wether or not you bealive me i did not get that tell for the rez till omw to village cause of lag but i had a group waiting and they had been waiting and at the time they were more importatn so wether or not you agree isnt my problem +)<br>
well you can love me or you can hate me but i dont feel bad for not rezzing him and people &quot;well if i was a cleric i would rez him&quot; yes i am a cleric and i do rez people i dont usually say no but most cleric understand that under certain situations its not possible to do so...i mean damn not liek im the only cleic in the zone!<br>

peice by peice i will tell you what happend that night...<br>
Ok i was in GD .. i zone into velks .. ( I GO AFK WHILE ZONING) ok...<br>
well i had long been zoned into velks before i came back so any tell you did send me had prolly scrolled by and i dont usually scroll up to see what i mised unless im expecting a tell... well so when i took off running i had no idea of any tells well wheni received your next tell due to lag which i have covered earlier i didnt see it well into my trip to village so i said &quot;no i cant&quot; i didnt say fuck off man i am not wasting 60 mana i just said no...<br>
well then he says didnt we give you boots? i reply, yes and im thankfull but im still busy...i have a group waiting on me and i dont have the time. he replys, whatever man i reply, dude i said i was sorry he replys (or shee i dont know heh) ok they reply, dude dont worry about it whatever no big deal ...<br>
so rather then pressign the issue i go on to my village...she or he could have brought them to me which apparently didnt happen so anyway... this above thought struck me after i sent those earlier messages and though i should share that and maybe this is why i appear to be a prick when it was just bad timing..beavlie my statements or not doesnt matter but if you wanna bealive brissen and i assume the pally about draggin corpses to me and still refusing thats ok also..<br>
and this stuff about flaming pallys i just do that cause its an inside joke that me and my friends have about pallys its nothign personal... i like pallys but you and i both no you dont match up to a warrior thats it ... they still are a cool class gah..heh <br>

<br>
here's another fact shizmo is a good honest person a friend and i know what he is saying is true<br>
<br>
here is another fact i am glad he didnt res you since you are bringing it on the board bitching like little ho's  <br>
<br>
if you dont like the way he handled it the answer is simple dont group with him or dont invite him on anymore raids no need to come here writing inflamatory shit when you have no idea whats going on in his world<br>

/sigh...cmon...I'm sorry..but if his ping and lag are that bad..does it make sense to try to navigate ICY paths, where you can fall....to go to a village to play healer if you may not get heals off in time? Sorry...doesnt add up...And we have every right to discuss what we wish here...so if ya dont like it...dont read it.  <p>Karas LightStrider

Don't join a group if you need to go afk for an hour and a half...and don't do it anyway when we say it's not a logical idea. 45 minutes before you even knew i disbanded you. /boggle to be Honest i'm not one to flame anyone...but i really want my friends and whoever reads this board to know it's not safe grouping with you.

And thank you Chaarmiing for proving my point. And like i said earlier I can heal a group with a 3k ping maybe not a village group which i did soon find out after getting there (and not one person died in there with me it was just that i wasnt responding fast) but i can heal a spider group if its members are liek 51+ ....<br>
And no ping has nothing to do  with walking on icy walk ways as far as that sorta thing goes i cand do it with 30% PL and a ping of 65k and i can still make it to frenz or fake wall the only thing that will be effected is the time that it takes for me to see somting happening. ex. maybe i will get attacked and wont know it at first but i can still walk just fine.<br>
