We began gathering about 1:30 pm Central, and were a bit late starting, with a good number of late arrivals. We were set to go in at 2:30 pm, but ended up entering about 3 pm. The participation was a little sparser than our usual Mixers, probably due to the remoteness of Kunark and this particular dungeon, and to the press release only have gone out the day before (my fault I'm afraid). Nevertheless, we had about 20 people total over the whole day. The ones I've got marked down were:<br>
<br>
Dabashire - 35 warrior - Peacekeepers (backup group leader)<br>
Quarthinos - 31 Ranger - Peacekeepers (group leader)<br>
Citen - 33 Mage - Knights of Hellfire (group leader)<br>
Goliza - 27 Shaman - Allied Giants<br>
Monza - 25 Shaman - Silver Daggers<br>
Chiagon - 32 Necro - Allied Giants<br>
Sapula - 30 Necro - Allied Giants<br>
Draeven - 26 Ranger - No Guild (Backup group leader)<br>
Spankie - 30 Shaman - Sun Moon Sect<br>
Palanka - 32 Cleric - Sun Moon Sect<br>
Nawty - 35 Druid - Darkwater Clan<br>
Briyn - 28 Druid - Illuminatus (Group Leader)<br>
Carmodyr - 30 Monk - Guilde des Templars<br>
Showueven - 25 Paladin - Guilde des Templars<br>
Lanany - 35 Shaman - Knights of Hellfire<br>
Arunian - 29 Bard - Vale Patrol<br>
Guppin - 30 Rogue - Darkwater Clan<br>
Boneheads - 28? Shaman - Allied Giants<br>
Valkre - ? Rogue - No Guild<br>
<br>
We proceeded quickly into the dungeon after a short briefing by me, making our way to the temple and through it with few fights, as there were a number of people camping the entrance and the temple itself. We gathered in the crypt room and readied ourselves to drop to the pool room on the second floor. We had not enough bat wings to levitate all 3 groups down, so we sent our monk down to feign death and scout the room out. There were few spawns in the pool room, so we dropped down 1 group at a time, cleared the room, then mapped out our path. First we sent one group to check on the lumpy goos, one of which was camped. So we made our way towards the imprecator's spawn spot on the second floor, clearing the hallways by bounding overwatch. <br>
<br>
Soon, the bedroom and the imprecator room was cleared, and though the imprecator was on track, he was not on the second floor. We kept the room clear for another spawn cycle, then I asked if we wished to proceed to the 3rd floor. The answer was yes, so we moved back to the pool room, losing one or two members who had to leave early. <br>
<br>
Back at the pool room, we prepped to journey to the 3rd floor. At this point, we learned of a monk on the 3rd floor who needed a revive for his friend. We said that we would help, as soon as we got our 1 cleric down. He kept the fountain area on the 3rd floor clear and we sent the first group down, with the cleric. No sooner had they disappeared beneath the pit trap when the pool room began to spawn behind us. We were up to our eyeballs in mobs, and our 2 groups that remained on this floor lost cohesion. Assisting was not done on this fight, and it showed, as we were slaughtered to the man, with the exception of our monk, who feigned right after I went down (we were the last 2 left alive of the 11 or so that were on this floor). Thanks to the monk, Carmodyr and the druid, Nawty, we managed to drag our corpses down to the 3rd floor, so the cleric could revive us. <br>
<br>
After a quick revivfication, then a medding, I began to plot our path on the 3rd floor. We would visit the Undead Blacksmith first, then move to the church, and from there, if interest warranted it, we'd move past the secret one-way door and through the rest of the dungeon, to at least the labratory. We moved to the blacksmith's room, but he was not around, though we managed to take a good number of kly with us. After regrouping from some Linkdeaths, we gathered at the fountain and cleared the way to the sarcophagus room, in the hopes of pulling the church to there. One of our number got stuck on the other side of the one way door, so we decided to clear the church, then move through into the pit. We began pulling the church, killing 4 of the 8 spawns there, then decided to viking raid the rest of the mobs there. Unfortunately, the area was camped (though I'd asked in shout and no one responded), so there were no more mobs to kill there. We then proceeded through the trap door, 1 group at a time, and had 2 of the 3 groups clear the pit area. We moved methodically through the pit to then take on and defeat the Spectral crusader easily. <br>
<br>
Clearing the underground river was easily accomplished, and there we stumbled upon a monk's corpse. We revived him quickly, and after thanking us, moved on his way. Now we gathered outside the barracks/labratory area, and once again, we called upon our monk to feign pull for us. He did so fairly well, allowing us to clear the barracks area. We gathered there, and could see the large dining area filled with caster Kly. We pulled clear the labratory area, but not without losing our monk, who we revived after a quick, ugly fight with the denizens of the lab. Still no imprecator spawn, however, so we decided to feign pull the dining area. 5 or 6 kills later, we gathered around the strange table, with a jarred frogluk head floating in a briny sauce looking down at us. We stood outside the final chamber of this dungeon, and could see into its heart, the very mob who controlled all things in this dungeon.... the Kly Overseer. Should we attempt to take him, or just wait for an imprecator to spawn in the lab? Should we just kill the dining area repeatedly to gain experience, then try to make a bold run past the Overseer? During the discussions, more mobs spawned, and we took care of them relatively easily. Finally, it was decided. Ziwut, a 47th level monk who we'd helped earlier, agreed to help us by feign pulling the overseer's room clear, then pulling the overseer. By this time, we had only 12 adventurers left, but most felt we could possibly take him. We buffed and steeled ourselves. <br>
<br>
The pull went acceptably, though we still got more than just the overseer. Unfortunately, the room began to repopulate as well. People began dropping like flies, including myself. When I'd recovered and began running back to Dalnir from the Overthere, I discovered that we had killed the overseer! However, only 1 person, Briyn, had survived and she'd been unable to loot him, before having to run out of the zone. Then began the corpse recovery. <br>
<br>
Thoughts on the Raid<br>
1) Loot was not so good... we hardly saw any of the named mobs that live here. We did get 2 sarnak emblazoned tabards, won by Guppin and Quarthinos, I won a frogluk crusher, and our resident monk, Carmodyr, won a bamboo bo stick. We never could find the imprecator, though we know he spawned a few times, just never where we were. The Overseer might have had something, but we never were able to get it. <br>
2) Group discipline was better on this raid than on some I've done in the past, though we still had some wandering. All in all though, the only complaint I have about our group discipline was in not assisting all the time, and in the corpse recovery.<br>
3)We were somewhat hamstrung the whole day by the class makeup of the raid. We only had 1 cleric, and 1 group teleporting druid. We had no enchanters, and no real nuker classes (though Citen did well as the only mage, and having a number of necros didn't hurt either). The druids and shamans we had did well in the healing roles, as there were only a few deaths outside of bad room respawns and the overseer room. Not having an enchanter in the overseer room definitely hurt us, as did the inability to evac. Not having an evacer for every group also hindered our ability to escape. We either had to fight through or try to sneak around the overseer, or try something else. <br>
4) Corpse recovery was absolutely awful. I'm partly to blame for it, but at the same time, I think our discipline broke down when getting to the corpses. We spent a total of about 5 hours on corpse recovery. This is entirely too long. We began by trying to invis the cleric and sending her down to begin revives. We lucked out in that Dabashire's corpse had magically been transported to the zone, so he accompanied Citen and Palanka down the first time. However, they were spotted and attacked. 6 more tries to get the corpses to the alcove and revive all met with failure, though Citen managed to loot his corpse, as did Palanka once. Unfortunately she died again after this. After about 3 tries, we should have begun dragging corpses to a different spot. Finally we started calling in friends and guildmates to help. Another botched attempt to get to the corpses ended in a few more deaths and most of the group gating out. I will launch one criticism here, though not at a specific individual. This gating out left one of my guildmates stranded alone in the dungeon, on the 3rd floor against I don't know how many mobs. This should not have happened. <br>
<br>
Finally, we got some help, from the very talented-at-corpse-recovery Eleysian and Jazen, of the Avatars of Fate. Minkey of Sun Moon Sect also showed up to help us clear the area of mobs so that we could invis the cleric and begin revives. Finally, we got the cleric down there, got myself and Dabashire revived and then began reviving others. We were horrified when 3 of the corpses were too old to revive, and one of the others had logged off. After getting all the revives we could, we began sending druids out after those who had to physically loot their corpses. Finally, about 2 in the morning my time, all the corpses we could get were looted and I said good night to Dalnir, battered, beaten and exhausted. <br>
<br>
Many thanks must go out to Eleysian, Minkey, Aalya, Kywn, Dogedme, Cassia, Nawty, Quarthinos, Citen, Vooch, Jazen and Dabashire, and Palanka for help in the corpse recovery. Some of these mentioned stayed until the last corpse was gotten (we had to leave one down there as its owner had logged off). It took much patience to get this done, and it took much longer than it should. <br>
<br>
My thoughts on Dalnir are that it should not be attempted without the evacers and/or the enchanters. Without one of those two roles filled, corpse recovery (which will be needed) becomes a nightmare. It is helped greatly with discipline, which is probably needed here as much as in any dungeon. <br>
<br>
All in all, it was a successful raid, as we &quot;did&quot; the dungeon in the classic sense. There were few areas of the dungeon we did not see and conquer. It wasn't a roaring success, due to the overlong corpse recovery, but it wasn't a failure by any means. The lessons learned will be thought over a lot in the next few weeks. <br>

I want to thanks all for this funny raid... specially Haemish for the lead (very good), Dogedme for the run and Eleysian for the invis.<br>
Yes the corpse retrieval was long (i finally gone to sleep at 9:00 AM in France)but i had lot ot fun.<br>
So, if you make other raid and you want a Monk, you can depend on the Guilde des Templiers.<br>
