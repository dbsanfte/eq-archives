<br>
One thing that strikes me about EQ...the people who harp on roleplaying are often the most unoriginal people you could find.  I'll just use Wood Elves as my example because I don't really want to go down the list of races.<br>
<br>
If you're a wood elf...you would not be calling someone M'lord or M'lady.  You wouldn't be concerned with bowing or curtsying.  You would not have manners.  When you read &quot;wood&quot; elf just substitute wood with &quot;wild.&quot;  Wood elves live in the middle of a vast forest filled with wasps, bats, and orcs...along with the odd insane brownie.  Wood elves are not civilized.  They live in huts amid the trees...not because they think its pretty, but because thats the level at which they're evolved.  They use the trees because it keeps their homes and children safe and its easier to defend from creatures than having their huts on the ground.  To summarize, wood elves are wild.<br>
<br>
Wood elves are a very common sight in EQ, gotta love the droods, and it irks me to see them roleplay as if they were from midevil England or something.  The same goes for Barbarians who RP like this...or just as bad...as if they were from Scotland.  Sure, Braveheart was a cool movie, but just because you carry a claymoore and wear a &quot;kilt&quot; doesn't mean you should be speaking in a scottish accent.  In unreality, you live in a harshly cold and barren tundra.  &quot;RPers&quot; should not take an aspect of reality and project it into our unreality.  Thats not good RPing thats plagiary.<br>
<br>
In game I RP a lot of the time, not all the time though.  I play a wood elf ranger...I don't kill wolves or bears, but I do kill lions.  I HATE cats. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I roleplay a chaotic character for all you D&amp;Ders.  Sometimes I'll be extra special sweet.  I'll love children and help the elderly cross the street.  At other times I'll kill something for looking at me funny, be they good or evil.  I RP a character thats fairly uncivilized IE I don't like non-priest magic users.  If I see a dirty enchanter sitting on the ground minding their own business I'll gleefully kick them in the back of the head and laugh.  On the other hand...I'm a ranger and I respect other travelers so if the same enchanter asked me for a SoW because he was about to take a long trip...I'd give it to him and wish him luck.<br>
<br>
Thats just something to compare yourselves too.  I'm not saying that I'm the greatest RPer or that you should do exactly as I do.  I'm just a roleplayer...to a degree.  There are degrees to roleplaying and I respect that.  My point is, please do not believe that because you call that level 4 troll warrior M'lord you're a &quot;good roleplayer.&quot;  Ahh well...I guess this is really just a flame on a type of RPing that I don't like...damn.  High ideals ground into a lowborn rant. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think you roleplay what you know...  I, for instance, do A LOT of live-action RP...and I DO play a Wood-Elf that has VERY curteous manners and DOES call people M'lord and M'lady, because she comes from a Wood-Elf society that holds Court...much like a Fae Court.  Her family resided in Court, so that is what my character knows.  I base my EQ character on this was well, Rumer, albet being a bit flighty and child-like at times is NOT a wild heathen running around in the woods...   If anyone CARES to ask about Rumer's background, I explain that her wordly travels have given her the manners and where-with-all to fit into other's social rings, instead of looking like an outcast who's been rolling around in the leaves in the forest.  True, Rumer does like to run with the wolves occassionally, but all-in-all, she is very polite...Rumer's daddy would not have had it any other way...he never liked how he was looked down upon, and he didn't want the same done to his daughter.  I could go into a long, drawn out thing about why Rumer acts the way she does, but what good would that do?  Just reveal a whole lot about my character that I would rather have people find out in game.<br>
<br>
I think my whole point here is that we can't go around stereotyping characters based on what race they are, i.e. High Elves are all snobs, Ogres are all dumb, Wood-Elves are all wild savages....  That is no better that stereotyping someone in real life.  I think if it bothers you to see a wood-elf or Barbarian saying M'lord and M'lady, don't come on a board like this and flame them...would be much more interesting to ask them in-character where they picked that up and why they do it.  Would expand the realm of RPing for both of you, I would think.  And feel free to come talk to Rumer sometime, she'll tell you all about how she came to be...and more than likely talk your ear off...  :P<br>

In Norrath races are strictly defined.  Races aren't just seperated by their ability to see at night, start off points, or classes.  No one seems to roleplay their character indiviually they stray over to the common behavior.  You can't roleplay a Troll the same way as a High elf...honestly if you wanted to act like a high elf...be a high elf.<br>

Ummm...I didn't get culture packets with my game...don't know about you...<br>
<br>
If a Troll wants to have the manners of a high elf, he can, plain and simple...that's how that person chooses to play that character.  And until you know the reasoning and background behind it, you really can't judge or say anything.<br>
<br>
Like I said, ask someone in-character why they act the way they do...go looking for an in-character response.  That will quickly weed out the 'good' from the 'bad'....see what I mean?<br>
<br>
One other thing, you said you play a 'chaotic' character, in reference to D&amp;D...well, you chose D&amp;D as your basis for your character.  I chose my live-action experience....until Norrath DOES have detailed, defined cultural information, we all have to base our character upon what we know.  And what you know may be different from what the rest of us know...that does not entitle us to give grief to one another over playing styles.<br>

<br>
&quot;Welcome to Kelethin, City in the Trees and home of the Woodland Elves! As one of Faydarks Champions, it is your duty to guard and protect the people and creatures of the Greater Faydark.

Nobody wants to play the typical character, they all want to be the unique character.  Everyone wants to have a twist to their character's personality, not play the standard archetype.  A classic example, when conceptualizing a MMORPG in which there are no NPCs, only players, who wants to play a farmer and till soil and feed pigs all day?  No, everyone would rather play the swashbuckling hero.  Therein lies the problem.<br>
<br>
I decided that my character would have a father who died a tragic and brutal death (although still comical since I am a comical character - being a halfling).  Surprise, surprise!  I soon find out that everyone else was orphaned at an early age too.  There must be something strange afoot in Norrath....<br>
<br>
What I'm getting at is that it's often more fun to play the high elf raised by orcs than it is to play the snobby high elf born and raised in Felwithe.  When this is the case, you will start to see more &quot;exceptions&quot; than you will &quot;rules.&quot;  I just accept this as an unavoidable trait of games like this and have fun.<br>
<br>
I myself try to play a something faithful rendition of a halfling, with a few twists, but mostly &quot;typical.&quot;  Of course some things must be different, as a true Tolkein hobbit has very little place in a world like Norrath.<br>

These classes can become limiting factors in a roleplayer's desire to make a unique character. How many of us have said &quot;I want to play an elf fighter-mage&quot; and proceeded to allow the race/class abilities/limitations decide *who* that character is? We need to be able to think &quot;outside the lines&quot; drawn for us by game designers. <br>
<br>
The first step is character concept. Who is this person? Where did they come from? What sort of character &quot;seed&quot; can you build from to create a coherent, believable persona? Some suggestions for character building points are: <br>
<br>
Fiction - Have you read any good books lately? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Believable characters abound in fiction and not only SF/Fantasy. I once used the Victorian &quot;gentleman burglar&quot; Raffles concept to make a noble thief who stole for the &quot;art&quot; of it, only attempting daring, next-to-impossible thefts. <br>
<br>
Selfish desire - Is there something you always wished you could have done in real life, but couldn't? Act through your character concept and express yourself!  Game design - as long as you don't limit yourself to a race/class restriction, you can certainly use the game design. I love playing dwarves, and my concept often starts out with &quot;I wanna be a dwarf&quot;. <br>
<br>
Power - a much misaligned character &quot;seed&quot;. Why not want the best and the most? Make it *interesting* though. The key is to imagine yourself in the characters place, and justify those desires with who the character is and act through the character's persona. For example: <br>
<br>
You want a character who is powerful, and can affect the course of nations. Class is immaterial, really, since all classes can become powerful. Take a &quot;fighter&quot; class, make him charismatic and thoughtful, and *poof* you have Alan of Battlewile, whose family was once renowned for their ability in battle and is currently in disrepute. He's the 5th son whose brothers are a bunch of fops. Disgusted by his family's lack of spine, he trains to become a warrior and sets out on his own, using the gold obtained through adventuring to hire people to do his bidding. Investing in merchant ventures, he earns enough money to create a world-wide courier organization, with fees for delivery for magical and mundane courier service. The couriers act as spies, and soon Alan is a powerful information broker. He trains and equips a mercenary army that strikes at *just* the right time to save an nation's fortunes, and is knighted by the king...  Once you have your character concept, you then need to fit it in the existing race/class system. The character I hope to play, Oghma, is inspired by the Celtic God of Knowledge, Bards and Strength - Oghma. In that concept there are several key elements. The character is a repository of cultural information, and he is physically powerful. Since I like dwarves, and dwarves are strong, I like the idea of a dwarven bard, but bard is not necessarily the correct class. As a character he is a bard only in the &quot;transmission of knowledge&quot; sense. He could also be a fighter, since the bardic song/spell ability really fits peripherally into the concept. As an individual, he would train more in things outside the bardic spell realm if possible. If started as a bard, he would wind up with high smithing and say, minor wrestling skills (the Celtic god was the best wrestler of the gods), with lore and knowledge being his intellectual focus. Spell/song abilities would be secondary. He could also be a Cleric, with a &quot;holy mission&quot;. It is even conceiveable that he be an Enchanter, going more towards showing the dwarven magic with armor and weapons... One of the things I like about dwarves is their smithing ability, a creative force much like the desire to create songs and tales. <br>

When it comes right down to it, who has the right to tell me what I can and can't do in a fantasy game that I *pay* for the right to play? This is fantasy. And, aside from flying like a fairy from one town to the other, (which you actually can do with levitate now that I think about it) I really could do anything I wanted.  If I wanted to be a halfling warrior (although in EQ I don't think you even have the option.....but you do in other rpg's) then that certainly is my perrogative.<br>

Spark the imagination in the younger folk.  Don't set rules that someone *has* to be a certain way just because society says so.  Be unique, and be your own, individual creation.  And by the way, that goes for RL as well as EQ. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urukkas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rukkas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#FF0000>(7/27/00 10:30:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My 2pp</span><hr size=1> all of you have very valid points there and i would like to first commend you all for even taking the time and &quot;effort&quot; to actually rp. many players i run across do not roleplay and that in itself is quite sad in my opinion. i pay it no mind though, if they want to be item campers, or power gamers so be it. you will find, as i have, that if you a re a roleplayer and not necessarily a &quot;good&quot; one other players will seek you out to group with and just be around you more than they do other non rp'ers. im off the subject here but im just rambling on with what i think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  anyway, if you come across someone who is rping and is not quite doing it &quot;right&quot;, give em a tell and ask them about their char. they may not know quite how to rp and are doing the best they can from what they know. (time for the guild plug hehe) many roleplayers on this server are kinda spread out through out the land and there are but a few &quot;roleplaying&quot; guilds out there. there are guilds that you can identify with as so if you see someone flying their guild tag you can pretty much bet you are looking at a pretty good rper. with that id like to invite all dark race roleplayers to take a look at the guild i have recently formed, the Severed Souls. i can pretty much assure you that it is not like any other guild you have seen before and definitely worth considering. my goal is to gather as many roleplayers together as i can so we can adventure with one another and enjoy expanding the games horizons through our own imaginations. anyway, enough of that. just had to throw my 2 coppers in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I mean, for a year and a half all I did was play Paladins.  I played all the races that would allow the class, and after all while it did get a bit monotonous.  <br>
<br>
So I came up with this storyline (on the Mith Marr server) where I was a Paladin that had lost her faith in Karana. This was the first time I had given it a shot, and I spent alot of time writing a long storyline on my guild's page about how I had been betrayed, and then I found the strength within myself to continue on a path of good and because I clung so feverently to the way of good, I could still cast the blessings, only it was a blessing of good, in general.  (I swear I did a better job of explaining on the page).  <br>
<br>
OMG you would not believe the crap I took for that. People quoted to me from every D &amp; D source there was.  Hey, I have played Dark Sun, D &amp; D, Magic, even *cringe* Ultima Online. But that does not mean when I came to Everquest I brought along all the rules and regulations of every past RPG I played.<br>
<br>
See I think a percentage of us are still clinging to the &quot;standard&quot; of a race that presents itself in other sources.  Okay Okay yes I do say &quot;Est Sularus Oth Mithas&quot; (My honor is my life from Dragonlance) all the time but that is because it pretty much summarizes my philosophy in the way I play my Paladins.<br>
<br>
I dont think a wood elf is a Kalinesti in Norrath.  I think a wood elf can be a depressed and moody person if she/he feels like it.  You never know, and that makes it alot more fun to find out someone's history.<br>
<br>
I guess what I am trying to say in this babbling post is that one should start fresh when beginning any RPG.  Stagnating in one class or race is silly, I promise.  <br>

I know a lot about dark elven society from just running around hailing every npc i can find.<br>
the designers put a lot of backstory in the game, you just have to look around for it.<br>

btw im not a constant roleplayer, i tend to go with whatever the person im interacting with is doing, if he/she is in character, im in character, if not, im not.<br>
i enjoy acting with others in character (i love running across mumsly), but lets face it, im too lazy to do it all the time. <br>

As for what someone mentioned about how everyone wants to play a hero--this is true.  A lot of people in LARP's do this to.  At first I was going to, but instead in the end I decided something else--I was a baker.  WTF, who wants to be a baker in a LARP?!  Well, I make damn good baklava, cookies, fudge, etc.  Good food=good money.  This doesn't really apply as much in EQ, as the whole point of the game is to be, &quot;Mr./Ms. Hero and slaying everything for phat exp.&quot;  I don't play EQ to rp, cause EQ isn't an rp'ing game.  I just get my rp fix elsewhere, that's all =).<br>

Check out Tolkien's story of Beren and Tinuviel (Luthien).  Specifically check out Fingol's treatment of Beren when Beren comes to Fingol to profess his love for Luthien.  Basically along the line of (not actual quotes), &quot;What right do you have to come to me presenting yourself as an equal when I won't even use mortals as servants?  For even entering Doriath you deserve death.&quot;  Fingol views humans as being &quot;base born&quot; and of &quot;short lived kingdoms and brief kings.&quot;  The behavior of Fingol is a good study in how I like to see Wood Elfs.  They hold themselves with a nobility; to the point of being rude and arrogant with other races and they view human kingdoms as a passing nuisance, at least in the Second Age.<br>

<br>
I just saw your post!  Sorry!!!  I play a LARP here in GA called Shattered Isles.  Truthfully, NERO seemed a bit too hack and slash for me.  And you mentioned people liking to be the hero, in the LARP I play, I don't play a hero either.  I am a flighty, fidgety elf who is a healer and a brewer (brewing healing brews and salves, not alcohol <br>
:-)  ).  I do play an archer though (boffer arrows, yeah!), but my elf doesn't like to hurt things, so if I have to shoot a nasty, I shoot it in the foot.  teehee  <br>
<br>
So what LARP do you play?<br>

Any attempt is a good effort in itself. <br>
<br>
I think one of the problems that plague the role playing community is the concept that role playing should be a done a certain way. There are 3 issues I see here: <br>
<br>
1) Everquest is rich in background and history, but the races and classes are loosely defined. Thus, when the background is vague, RP players will tend to make up their own history, their own background. Players will fill in the gaps, and I find that perfectly reasonable. <br>
<br>
2) Some races/professions are EASIER to role play than others. <br>
<br>
An Ogre is not very difficult to roleplay as long as you put in the effort. Bee-kos me jus hafta speek lyke dis en me sowds just like a grate beeg Oager most uf da tymes. Joo under stans dat?<br>
<br>
An Iksar issss also very easy to role play.... there isssss just so much you can do to portraysss a reptilian lizardman....*hisssss* *hisssss* <br>
<br>
But how exactly do you role play a High Elf paladin? What exactly does a High Elf Paladin do or say that makes them any different from the rest of Elfkind, or Humankind, or other Paladins? Chivalry? Wrong. Chivalry is not unique to High Elf Paladins. In fact, it's not even unique to Paladins, period. Anyone can pretend to be chivalrous and say mi'Lord and mi'Lady all the time. <br>
<br>
Again, sadly, some races or classes are just more difficult to role play than others.<br>
<br>
3) Is this Norrath or is this The Forgotten Realms? <br>
<br>
I'm not really against this, but I find it funny that many role players THINK they are playing in the Forgotten Realms instead of the world of Norrath. <br>
<br>
Many EQ role players choose to ignore the world of Norrath, choose to ignore the history of Norrath, and they instead immerse themselves in the D&amp;D world. IMHO, they have every right to role play that way if they choose. <br>
<br>
But I will say one thing in defense of Norrath. Verant made a damn good effort to provide us with a rich amount of Norrathian history. Not everyone knows a LOT about Norrathian history, probably because all this info is scattered in many places. Some of it is in the EQ manuals. Some of it is embedded in quest information. Some of it comes from the history books we can purchase in the game. And some of it is still history yet to be unraveled by any player. <br>
<br>
But players still tend to go back to &quot;old habits&quot;, so they would rather role play a Dungeons and Dragons &quot;Drow Elf&quot; than role play a TierDal follower of Innoruuk. I'm really curious why this is. <br>
<br>
Is it because D&amp;D history and lore is just ten times better than the Norrathian history and lore? <br>
<br>
IMHO, if I wanted to role play in a D&amp;D world, I would be playing in a D&amp;D game. <br>
<br>
This is the world of Norrath, and thus I choose to accept, I choose to learn the history, the traditions, and the lore of the world of Norrath. <br>
