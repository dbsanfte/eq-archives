let me pose a humble question can anyone have an opposing veiw to your's without being closeminded?<br>
<br>
is it within the realm of possiblity that someone has heard both sides, weighted them, thought them through , analyzed them.. and  HORROR OF HORRORS found YOUR posistion to be WRONG?????<br>

This type of utter ARROGANCE is the true afront to thinking people everywhere! The fact that noone is dared allowed to disagree with you vomitious infantile pablum with out being called closeminded is the last line of defense for your tired and failed position<br>

your right Mandalon there was a great deal of thought behind his post most of it DEAD WRONG!!!! the amount of thought going into something makes it no more or less valid <br>
<br>
 you can think the earth is flat you can develope grand thesises on the subject, you can spend hours holding great think tanks to support your theory , you can find other morons to agree with you and write thesises supporting your posistion,and still be WRONG and have the evidence prove you wrong<br>

Believe what you want, nothing said on a message board dedicated to video games will change your mind anyways. I could go on and on about the cultural reasons behind these types of traditions, which generally boil down to alliances between tribes/families for potential access to resources during times of stress, and how these more brutal traditions and severe patriarchies tend to form in marginal environments (like in various Inhuit groups, some plains indians groups, and - what a coincidence! - among the various tribal regions in asia and north africa). I could go on giving you productive ways for effecting change. I could continue to point out similarities between various western religions and traditions, which died out only after the industrial revolution, and some of which still exist.<br>
<br>
Maybe those of you that didn't take the time to even think about I wrote will go back and do so. You will noticed I never said, &quot;hey! leave those guys alone! child gang rape r0xors!&quot; I said that the reaction should be one of empathy for the child, horror for what happened, and a desire to effect change to end such traditions. I pointed out that through education and modernization these types of things will die out, as those involved will stand up and refuse to take such actions, social mores regarding individual rights change, and change occurs within the society. What was the reaction? That I am somehow a moral relativist and was giving them carte blanche to do what they will. That is obviously false, and can be seen as false if anyone would take the time to read what I said.<br>
<br>
Hell, I have no problem with the elders being arrested and tried in court, as this was not legal within their country. They should be prosecuted. What should *not* happen is an entire culture demonized by people outside the culture that know nothing about it. They are human beings, they are following the laws and traditions they have been taught, that does not make them inhuman or evil, or worthy of being &quot;wiped out&quot;. I'm not a prosyletizer. I'm not here to convert anyone's ideals, mores, values, or whatever. I am trying to cool down a knee-jerk violent reaction that does not attempt to fight an issue at its source, but simply violently do damage that is counter productive.<br>
<br>
BTW, for the person that said, &quot;Yeah, the US is nortorious for our courts to order things like gang rapeing 18 year old women for &quot;crimes&quot; commited by familey members&quot;, I never said the U.S. courts. If you read the article, you will see their courts are prosecuting them. By your logic the fact their courts don't order such things means that this must have never happened. Sorry to tell you, but there are a lot of places where various horrific things within the U.S. have happened. Like white women being murdered for sleeping with a black man. Like daughters being killed by their fathers (in some rare cases by both parents) for being a &quot;slut&quot; and having sex before marriage. Like children being murdered for &quot;embarassing&quot; their parents. The situations pop up when there is, within a social group (whether nation, relgion, family, etc.), a devaluation of women and children. The idea of property often occurs as a result. This kind of traditions are the foundation of western society, and judeo-christian belief structures in particular.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, these things have changed as individual rights have come to the fore (women's rights, children's rights, etc). They occured due to education. They can occur elsewhere as well.<br>
<br>
You can sit back and harp on me all you want if it makes you feel better about yourself. It doesn't bother me. If I can deal with creationists bothering me every single day, I can deal with a childish response to me simply saying, &quot;Hey, stop looking at these people through your values system and through the idea of this having happened within your system, look at the culture and see what can be done to effect change&quot;. Whatever.<br>

Funny. I haven't personally attacked anyone. Closest I came was a general statement about &quot;religious morons&quot;, and anyone that states, &quot;Just another example of why we need another 40 days &amp; nights Flood,&quot; implying they believe in Noah's arc, well, then I feel religious moron is a justified statement. I also haven't targeted anyone. I haven't even heard a counter argument at all beyond, &quot;they suck, they deserve to die!&quot;. Nice.<br>
<br>
Let's atcually look at what was written. I wrote that I was disgusted by the attitudes of the responses to the linked story. I gave the reasons why this was not a reasoned or reasonable response. In response, I had someone make a ridiculous &quot;paraphrase&quot; claiming that all my post said was &quot;I hate christians&quot; and that I had portrayed &quot;ignorant judgementalism&quot;. I responded with what I had actually said, and asked for what I had said that portrayed such. Then, I am attacked as a &quot;social relativist&quot; (the term is moral relativist btw) and various other things, and then this gem, &quot;There is NO reason cultural or historical for it that is acceptable regardless of your addlebrained reasonings&quot;. Sorry Sparky, I never said it was acceptable now did I? I never said it was &quot;OK&quot; now did I? I never said, &quot;hey, its their culture, its ok to them&quot; now did I? What I said was simple, and boils down to this:<br>
<br>
&quot;There are historical and cultural reasons why a tradition like this comes about, and rather than labeling a whole society as &quot;subhuman&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, we should look at what can be done to effect change from within the society, which would be the only way lasting change will come about, primarily through education and modernization.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then (I suppose you're just sitting there hitting refresh responding to imaginary posts) you go further into name calling, and end that with, &quot;yes ive stooped to name calling and insults because Aza doesnt rate polite dialouge as he is obviously threatened by anyone who dares oppose his world view, which any educated openminded person can see is SO dogmatic that it cant tolerate scrutiny&quot;. Perhaps you should actually READ this thread. No one has presented any counter arguments to my point, just harangued on and on about how &quot;evil&quot; this was. Perhaps you would like to actual tell me how anything you have written and continuously attributed (between childish name calling) as a response to me, in any way whatsoever responds to what I have written or pertains to anything I have said?<br>
<br>
Its also a very ironic statement, since you are apparently SO willing to discuss other people's views. /sarcasm<br>
<br>
Things like this is why I hate the internet sometimes. I find it hard to believe anyone could be this stupid in a face to face setting.<br>

<br>
Agree the action re the young girl was absolutely 100% WRONG. Personally, I can think of NO justification whatsoever for this behaviour, anthropological or otherwise.<br>
<br>
BUT it is often the case that we &quot;judge&quot; based on our own culture and experiences and sometimes that sets us up to look reactionary rather than clear thinking and evolved.<br>
<br>
I'm Australian, and here the idea of capital punishment is alien.  We haven't put anyone to death for their crimes for a hundred years.  So when I read about those states in the US that still practice the &quot;death sentence&quot;, it really does throw me.<br>
<br>
But I don't judge the entire country or culture on it.  I know many many states do not condone capital punishment... just because this one village you're talking about did something we ALL should find completely and utterly inhumane, doesn't mean that the entire culture should be wiped out.<br>
<br>
Judge the crime, judge the INDIVIDUAL/s responsible for it... but don't throw an entire culture to the wolves because someone screwed up really badly.<br>
<br>
If so, we'd all be doomed... the Aussies would  be wiped out over their HISTORICAL treatment of the Aboriginals, the States over their Native Americans and slavery policies of the PAST, Britain over just about everything they've ever done... hell, you guys were burning and drowning so called witches because some man couldn't keep his privates in his trousers!<br>
<br>
I think that's the point trying to be made here... I THINK.  All societies GROW UP, some are already ahead of others and some may never move forward (who knows).<br>
<br>
Just remember, Christians were being happily fed to lions at one point.  Was it right? No.  So surely we can all see that PERHAPS things do change. Let's hope so for the children of the world. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umareenadeviant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mareena Deviant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(7/4/02 7:53:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=629.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Unbelievable!</span><hr size=1> Oh and by the way...

&quot;Funny. I haven't personally attacked anyone. Closest I came was a general statement about &quot;religious morons&quot;,&quot;<br>
<br>
this is a clever dodge, you personally attacked the previous poster for their beliefs now you like the scummy artful dodging coward you are  try to pass  it off as a &quot;general statement&quot; where as I have the intestinal fortitude to name you by name<br>
<br>
&quot;Its also a very ironic statement, since you are apparently SO willing to discuss other people's views. /sarcasm&quot;<br>
<br>
I in NO way am claiming to debate you, you sexless freak I'm openly and viciously counterattacking you, this isn't I dialogue, I'm making fun of you, mocking you and insulting you... gee thought an obviously educated brainiac like you would have figured that out. <br>
<br>
don't throw the first punch then claim to be a pacifist if the person responds in kind!!!!<br>

You are welcome to come talk to me &quot;face to face&quot; anytime. You seem to find it amusing to make stupid personal attacks on me, and now going the dumbass route of &quot;I would do X to you in RL&quot; that so often happens and these threads. Well. I am here, I don't hide behind the internet. My address is listed publicly, so is my name.<br>
<br>
Now, perhaps you can stop acting like a typical internet message board troll and try and discuss the issues brought up in my posts? Or do you want to continue showing your maturity? Doesn't make much difference to me.<br>
<br>
BTW, the posters calling the people making up the Pakastani tribal cultures barbarians, non-human, and diseased and intimating the need for &quot;god&quot; to deal with them (doesn't take much to see how they wanted it taken care of) are those that set the tone. I, at least, would talk out the issue and try and make a point. These people who are responsible for this incidence should be jailed. We should be properly horrified. We should not talk about how these people are subhuman and need to be &quot;wiped out&quot;. I suppose because U.S. courts rarely convict men of rape, and U.S. society has a &quot;blame the victim&quot; attitude towards women, the entire U.S. should be &quot;wiped out&quot;, and all of us are &quot;subhuman&quot; and &quot;diseased&quot;? Funny, sounds like what the militant Islamic groups like Al Qaeda do, charge us with being an immoral and diseased culture because of their opinions on what some of us, or our government does, and advocating the destruction of the west.<br>
<br>
I suppose the institutionalized child rape and incest of some sects of Morman society means all mormans or all christians or all westerners should be &quot;wiped out&quot; and that all are &quot;diseased&quot; and &quot;sub human&quot;? You should be outraged when things like this happen anywhere. You should not brand a whole culture/society/nation/religion etc as &quot;evil&quot; and advocate their destruction.<br>

<br>
But alas no youre not worth the airfare now if youre ever in Chicago I’d be glad to sit down over a cup of coffee and  debate and dicuss with you..mind you now you open youre dialog like you did here and I WILL punch you in the head<br>

YOU’RE RIGHT!!!! And they say modern education is failing us<br>

Gee I guess you can brand Jews, Christians, and Muslims with a broad brush as morons? and that’s OK?????? <br>

The problem is you came off sounding like an egotistical chest thumping moral authority. Message was good. Delivery was bad.<br>
<br>
Cannibalism is wrong to most western cultures. However, if you were a member of certain tribes in Africa then it would be a perfectly acceptable belief with strong religious overtones (I’m not going to claim to be an anthropologist and know which tribes or religions). Point is yes, with certain beliefs you have examine the action along with the cultural context. <br>
<br>
However, there are certain truths that we believe to be universal to ALL humans in ALL cultures. I’m not talking 10 Commandments or any other religious equivalent. But instead beliefs and values that transcend social, cultural and religious context. I am fairly certain gang rapeing a 13 year old girl is UNIVERSALLY unacceptable. <br>
<br>
The individuals who would do this are most definitely sub-human and the scum of the earth. Initial outrage sets in and people may say thing and want to do things that they would never consider. Perfect example, immediately after 9/11 my mother (who was a hippy in the 60’s, peace loving, anti-war) thought the president should nuke the hell out of the whole Middle East.<br>
<br>
I’m certain that no one would seriously bring about the end of the world over this. If people want to express their outrage…let them do so. <br>

<br>
Abazagaroth said that we cannot call people who committed this crime evil on the basis that their culture is different from ours and that is what they are taught.  Bull Sh&quot;t.  <br>
<br>
If my culture allowed me to rape, murder, whatever, I wouldn't do it.  It is not in my nature.  Are we to believe that these people have no means of knowing what is right and wrong?  <br>
<br>
Jesus made the statement, &quot;Do unto others.......&quot; and he was more uneducated than these people and that was hundreds of years ago.   (That is not a religious point, it's historical.) <br>
<br>
All people who have a normal childhood socialization know the difference between what is basically right and wrong.  Their parents teach them from babies just by picking them up when they fall down and caring for them in general.  <br>
<br>
This is not the middle of back Africa where people still settle things with stick fights.   Perhaps the region is a bit remote, however I'm sure they were aware that this act was illegal.  And if nothing else, they have to have some exposure to &quot;western&quot; ideals.  The whole world does, no matter how repressed they are. <br>
<br>
You can not tell me that these people don't know gang rape is an awful crime.  And you can not tell me that I am being ethnocentric to judge this act and these individuals using my cultural values.  They are not cultural values, they are human values.<br>
<br>
It is wrong however to judge the entire society.  I have not done that.  I'm sure there are alot of good people in Pakistan  who do not accept rape as okay.  I'm sure that girl's mother doesn't think that there was justice in it.  I'll bet most of the nation is outraged and embarassed over it.  As they should be.  Blanket statements such as &quot;nuke them all&quot; are wrong.  (albeit a natural intitial reaction) <br>
<br>
Because this is a flame board I feel I should end with.....<br>
