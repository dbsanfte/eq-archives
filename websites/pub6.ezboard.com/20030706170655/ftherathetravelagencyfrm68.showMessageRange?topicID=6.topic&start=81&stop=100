So you are saying that US policy has allowed the UN to help oppress the Iraqi people for the past 12 years(food for oil)? Great! Maybe we should just kick the UN's ass instead. <br>

Is that a threat or a suggestion? If you see a man being beat in the street by an angry mob and you decide to step aside and voice what you saw later, does this make you smart or just mean you lack conviction? Or maybe just trying to editatorialize with fear? My child tries to censor me using similar tactics.

And yes I did it with an open mind.<br>
<br>
I read the first part.  Basically it the opinion of those signed that the war is wrong.  I must admit, they threw up a good argument as to what's wrong.<br>
<br>
But then I got to the bottom half and they blew it. Again, this is the classic spin scenario.  Partial truth imbedded with a lot of conjecture.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Traditionally, &quot;defense&quot; means defense of national territory. On September 11, an attack actually took place on and against U.S. territory.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
National territory also includes holdings outside of geographic boundaries.  Embassies, military bases, etc. are also considered national terrority.  U.S. embassies have been attacked and don't forget the U.S.S. Cole.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This was not a conventional attack by a major power designed to seize territory. Rather, it was an anonymous strike against particular targeted institutions.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Anonymous?  These people want us to believe that no organized entity is responsible?  Amazing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In the absence of any claim of responsibility,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Captured Taliban and Al-Qaeda members have admitted that they were responsible.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the symbolic nature of the targets may have been assumed to be self-explanatory. The World Trade Center clearly symbolized U.S. global economic power, while the Pentagon represented U.S. military power.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is clearly a terrorist act.  And what do terrorists want to instill?  Fear?<br>
<br>
Well they did a good job of that.  Problem is they underestimated our resolve to bring justice.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Thus, it seems highly unlikely that the September 11 attacks were symbolically directed against &quot;American values&quot; as celebrated in the United States.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
On the contrary, this was done to directly target American values.  One of the things we treasure most is being safe and not living under the threat of attack.  Pearl Harbor taught us that lesson and in turn we taught it back to Japan.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>According to reports, 15 of the 19 identified hijackers were Saudi Arabians hostile to the presence of U.S. military bases on Saudi soil.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Don't forget they admit to being members of Al-Qaeda.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>September 11 suggests that the nation projecting its power abroad is vulnerable at home, but the real issue is U.S. intervention abroad.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Also don't forget that September 11 suggests that to attack the most powerful nation on earth lends itself to severe repercussions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Indeed the Bush wars are designed precisely to defend and strengthen U.S. power abroad. It is U.S. global power projection that is being defended, not domestic freedoms and way of life.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ahh the true spin comes out.  These people that signed this actually expect everyone to believe this dribble.  These people expect everyone else to believe this dribble.<br>
<br>
No matter what President Bush says is our justification.  No matter the fact that the U.S. Congress approved it overwhelmingly, no matter that a significant majority of people in the U.S. agree with it, they want us to think it's all a ploy and our government's motives are the opposite of what we believe.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but when I read all that at the bottom of the letter, it's like the first half didn't mean jack.<br>
<br>
Next I clicked on your second link.  Mind you I tried to keep an open mind but was difficult after reading the first one.<br>
<br>
The second link is nothing but a lot of links.  So I clicked on just one link.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://reese.king-online.com/Reese_20030224/index.php" target="top">One of the links</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
It order to present some form of credibility, you cannot have links to someone that has no credibility.<br>
<br>
Here is some of the things Charlie Reese said:<br>
<br>
Right off the bat in the first paragraph.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Bush administration adamantly insists that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, but despite 12 years of inspections, bombings and spying, it doesn't have a clue as to where they are.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wait, let me requote what I posted earlier from the U.N.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>While Iraq claims — with little evidence — that it destroyed all biological weapons unilaterally in 1991, it is certain that UNSCOM destroyed large biological weapons production facilities in 1996.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Iraq claimed it destroyed all biological weapons in 1991.  Hans Blix himself calls that a lie.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>personally don't know if these weapons exist in Iraq or not. I do know they exist in many other countries.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nice denial spin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do know that in the Gulf War, Iraq did not use any chemical or biological weapons, even when it was being routed from Kuwait and &quot;bombed back into the preindustrial age,&quot; to use an American phrase.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok everyone.  Take a good look at this statement.  Before I get into the spin look carefully at the word ROUTED.  And also look at the phrase &quot;bombed back into the preindustrial age&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you believe anything he says after seeing this, you truly are stupid.  However, there's more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do know that in the 12 years since, Iraq has not used any chemical or biological weapons,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There you go.  The nail in his coffin.  He is basically saying that everyone else has lied about the known usage of chemical weapons against the Kurds in Northen Iraq after they supposed told the U.N. they had no such weapons.  Even the U.N. Security Council knew this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>even though it has been subjected to the harshest economic sanctions in modern history<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now this is the icing on the cake, so to speak.  Those sanctions were authorized by the U.N.  Here's the exact words of the U.N. in resolution 1441.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1. Decides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions, including resolution 687 (1991), in particular through Iraq's failure to cooperate with United Nations inspectors and the IAEA, and to complete the actions required under paragraphs 8 to 13 of resolution 687 (1991);<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The United Nations itself says that Iraq is in material breach of its obligations.  Not me, not you, not President Bush, the U.N.<br>
<br>
So basically, this guy is anti-U.N. because he condemned the actions of the U.N. but since he is the king of spin he says this...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do know that the only leader threatening the world with nuclear weapons and pre-emptive attack is George W. Bush.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So. Patootie, I kept an open mind.  I read the whole first link, but gave up on the second one because link after link is just like Charlie.<br>
<br>
So I throw it back at you.  Keep an open mind.  Go back and read all the U.N. resolutions.  All of them.  Then tell me who has an open mind unless of course you don't believe in the U.N. any more than Charlie does. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=joekreeper1>joekreeper1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/25/03 6:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Promise to the Anti-War Advocates</span><hr size=1> Ive seen lots of right wingers ( myself included ) but the only one to post a racial slur was Jur, ( he was quoting , I think The movie Three Kings  NOT calling Arabs sand niggers)<br>

No more idiotic than playing canned messages from a supposed untouched, unaffected Saddam Hussein.<br>
<br>
My post was made as a joke but also to prove a point.  Until I see Saddam Hussein get on TV and say something, anything that confirms he is alive, unhurt, and in control NOW besides a generic &quot;keep fighting&quot; and &quot;we will win&quot; canned, recorded spin to project the illusion of control, then I will believe he isn't in control.<br>

That is racist man, EXTREMELY racist. The Iraqi government , for all its faults and misgivings, is one of the few middle eastern governments that actually tolerates religious freedom, grated that is the only thing they do not control. You are outright making fun of one of the most misunderstood, most misquoted/misused, and yet peaceful and beautiful religions in the world today, just because of the color of these peoples skin. I work with a few devout Muslims from southern Pakistan and these guys are the nicest most giving guys I know. The insanity that surrounds the middle eastern region is based on religion yes, extreme fundamental religious freaks, but does that make the majority of Muslims all sheep? Fuck no and fuck you for implying it. Christianity is responsible for more death in the name of a god than any other religion in the history of the known world, the KKK, Nazi's, Spanish Inquisition, Salem witch trials, the extinction of most of the native American population, and the crusades need I go on? Does this mean that Christianity is a bad religion, I don't think so, I think some bad people did some bad things and used it as an excuse to do them, just like osama did. Do not base your judgment on these people based on what a few lunatics do. I'm not wanting to turn this into a religious discussion but that part of that post was idiotic, moronic, and above all racist. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pwnkoleto>pwnkoleto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/25/03 8:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Promise to the Anti-War Advocates</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>More and more Iraqis are going to the mosque; more and more Iraqi women are wearing the veil. <br>
<br>
This is an unusual phenomenon in a country that has always been staunchly secular and is ruled by the secular Baath party. But for Iraqis, struggling with life after two wars and 12 years of sanctions, religion is slowly becoming a refuge.<br>
<br>
The growing religious mood was first perceived as a threat by the Iraqi regime but instead of stopping it, the regime co-opted it and religious fundamentalism is not tolerated.<br>
<br>
Religion is now used to promote the Iraqi president not only as an Arab leader but also a Muslim one. There is also an attempt to use religion to try to erase religious differences inside Iraq. <br>
<br>
&quot;Iraq always been a secular state and the Baath has always been a secular party,&quot; said Abdel Razzak al Hashimi, a leading member of the Baath party. <br>
<br>
&quot;But we are aiming at a better understanding of religion as a factor uniting people. It's very important when the country is under threat, so that the people are united around the leadership and around the objectives of this leadership,&quot; he added.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So let's see, Saddam Hussein was a member of the Baath Party which is predominantly secularist.  But I will give Saddam credit for being a smart man in this sense.  What better way to unite the Arab world that to embrace the predominant religion of the Arab world?<br>

<br>
The Iraqi president's latest gift to posterity is the Saddam mosque, on the road to the airport.<br>
<br>
Construction started in 1999 and the mosque will be the biggest in the Middle East. <br>
<br>
Before that, Saddam Hussein built the Mother of all Battles mosque, in reference to the name he gave to the 1991 Gulf War. <br>

I'm sorry pat, but this is Saddam Hussein and the pinnacle of his bullshit.

As for my religion it is none of your business because I would rather not give you more fuel for your bigotry, but I am not Muslim. I do however respect other religions and ways of life, when they are chosen by the individual. You don't have to be Muslim or Buddhist or Native American to see and appreciate the beauty of their respected religions/ways of life. Just because someone is different does not mean they are wrong.<br>
<br>
Nowhere did I throw mud, I stated the facts as they are. If that got your pee pee all shriveled up, sorry. Those things happened in the name of Christianity. Other religions are just as guilty as Christianity and Islam of murder and subjugation of others because of religious differences. I just thought it would drive home a point, which you most likely missed.<br>
<br>
I would like to see the guy ousted more than anyone, and your reason for posting the post is noted and I understand that. BUT you continued on and took it to a racial level that is just despicable. My post had nothing to do with what the Arab world thought about the war, or even the war at all. I have stated my position on the war and what think of it several times. I simply called you out for the racist shit you posted.<br>
<br>
Joe, <br>
<br>
I love ya man, you crack my ass up and you got a good head on your shoulders. I concede that the KKK and the Nazi's are a bastardized version of Christianity with roots in other Nordic religions, but so are several sects out there that have been accepted Baptist, Assembly of God, and Mormon as a few examples each with it's own extreme take on 1 or 2 particular parts of the religion doctrine. The fact that the KKK and Nazi's are fanatics does not negate the fact that they are primarily based on the branch of Christianity brought about by Martin Luther (the old German guy not the civil rights activist for those who are scratching their head). Islamic Jihad is a fanatic sect of Islam but they have their roots in true Islam, I personally see a parallel there with the KKK and the Nazi's.<br>
