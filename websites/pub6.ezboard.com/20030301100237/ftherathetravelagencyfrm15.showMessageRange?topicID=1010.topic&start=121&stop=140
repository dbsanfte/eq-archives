<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Last time I checked my history books, Hitler tried to take over all of Europe and killed millions and millions of innocent people due to his facist beliefs. Saddam has killed some of his people, yes, but his actions don't even land in the same ballpark as Hitler's. There really is no association or likeness between the two, besides the fact that they both murdered civilians.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  The difference between Hitler and Saddam is that Hitler had the means to fight back against every other country in the world- if he had played his cards right, he would have won.  This was not true of Saddam.  Saddam and Hitler wanted the same thing, just with a different name attached.  Hitler wanted everyone on Earth bowing to his name and the Superior Aryan Race out of fear of getting killed by the SS.  Saddam wanted everyone on Earth bowing to his name and the Superior Arab Race (the Iraqi kind) out of fear of getting killed by the Republican Guard.  The only different between the two was means. (and race/religion/country/etc etc)<br>

My bad.  <br>
<br>
And here's some statistical data from our government on the veterans who served in GulfWar 1.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Using the most current statistics from the Department of Veterans'Affairs:<br>
-696,628 U.S. troops served in the Gulf War between August 2, 1990 and 1991. All are considered &quot;Gulf War Conflict&quot; veterans by the VA.<br>
-575,978 (83%) of those were eligible for VA benefits.<br>
-263,000 (45%) of those sought medical care at VA facilities for Gulf War Syndrome symptoms.<br>
-Of the remaining 312,978 (575,978 less 263,000), 183,629 (32%) filed claims for service-related medical disabilities.<br>
-Of those 183,629 disability claims, 136,031 (74%) were approved in whole as total disability. 19,976 have been approved for partial disability payments.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Bottom Line:<br>
At least 64% of all U.S. troops who served during the Persian Gulf War were (and still are) at high risk of developing the symptoms and disabilities of Gulf War Syndrom.<br>
<br>
So while we may not take many casualties on the battlefield, it seems as though our men and women in uniform have suffered tremendously.  Nevertheless, Send them all to Iraq with Joekreeper leading the way with his military expertise.  <br>

You stated something without any kind of proof of leg to stand on.  The fact that 130,000 soldiers are getting full disability, directly because of the first war, is fact.  That would mean that nearly 130,000 of the 260,000 which you claim to be suffering from nothing, must have something.  Whether it be mental, physical, or the 'mystery' GWS that the most unfortunate get.    <br>

 Ill type real slow and use small word because obviusly your parents didn't love you and sent you to public schools....<br>
<br>
The servicemen sought treatment for Sysptoms of GWS<br>
<br>
A certain % of the recieved treatment<br>
<br>
A certain % of them had some TOTALLY different malody(sickness) than GWS and got treated for it.<br>
<br>
you're numbers may be correct but your logic is at best, flawed <br>
<br>
OK i'll break it down to story time puddinghead<br>

If a large number of veterans are getting sick because of the chemicals from the war that is all the MORE reason to go back.  It is a sign of what Hussein is willing to do to get his way.  <br>
<br>
The last thing the world needs to do is sit back and allow him to improve his methods of killing mass numbers of people.  If we attack now will a lot of people die?  Sadly, the answer is of course yes.  If we wait, we will only multiply that number when the world realizes it HAS to go in.<br>
<br>
The U.S. has been extremely patient in my view in giving Iraq chances to conform to the agreement they signed.  Iraq has done nothing but resist all efforts to stop it from  producing chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.  I don't want to use force against Iraq because I want to see people die.  I believe force is necessary at this point to avoid even more bloodshed down the line.  <br>

I am beginning to think you should head to one of those learn at night courses, to augment your reading comprehension skills. At this point you take 1 to mean 2, and then sputter out some irelevant, useless drivel and think it is a valid rebuttle.

If your definition of it varies from mine, then yes, maybe your &quot;facts&quot; are correct.<br>
<br>
Other then that, these facts were posted to open up the eyes of those who keep stating that last time we went into war with Iraq, we demolished them.  Yes, we had decisive victories on the battlefield, but lots of our troops are suffering from the repercussions from the Gulf War, too.  As I stated about 3000 times on here, I am not against going to war with Iraq if we have Proof.  By proof, I don't mean GWB getting up in front of his podium and stating something.   You know, if  I was the only American citizen who was feeling a little leery about our Government's objectives at this point in time, maybe I would be an outcast, but I'm not.  There is a reason to why the Government is contemplating showing their actual proof and this is because much of the U.S. public and other people around the world aren't buying GWB's word.  Whether right or wrong, there is sound reason to not believe just his word.  <br>
<br>
If you've never heard of &quot;public choice economics&quot;, I suggest you read an article or two on it.  It's a basic concept which goes along with our economic structure.  That is, you or I are always out to maximize our own utility and we take for granted that our government is out to do the same.  Elected officials are out to maximize their utility which means getting votes by promising things(whether they be in our best interest or not) and also to maximize their own utility through whatever it may be.<br>
<br>
Now with Econ .99 discussed, lets look at GWB's background. <br>
<br>
A) His family has gotten the majority of its wealth off of the oil business.  - Albeit, a lot of other elected officials have, too.-<br>
B) There are other obvious reasons to why GWB would want to go into Iraq.  It is well known that most that a plan to assassinate his father was botched.  <br>
C) His father should have finished this problem a decade ago, and I'm sure he and his father knows this and now is a reasonable time to pick up where his father left.<br>
<br>
These are all possibilities leading towards why some peoples rational lead them to thinking there might be alternative reasoning to this.  <br>
<br>
Now, with those stated, IF we are shown proof that Iraq harbors weapons of mass destruction, that will erase those doubts of some of the U.S. public and the rest of the world.  There has been war rhetoric and hundreds of statements of so-called fact that we know they are, but no proof yet.  Show me the proof, I'll show you my 100% backing.  I don't think myself, as a taxpayer and citizen of this country, am asking too much.  I will tell you though, that I do back our armed forces 100% whether or not I believe in the cause or not, because I do realize that they are under order to follow what our government tells them to.       <br>
<br>
Livius-  I realize that maybe that 12 years ago is enough smoking proof to go after them for you, but it still is not for me.  We were going after them not because of weapons of mass destruction, but because of their invasion of Kuwait and it's oil production.  Also, please realize that I'm sure we used some sort of chemical weapon during that war and that some of these problems might have been caused by our own, although not all.  Also realize that we gave Iraq the majority of their armaments (including what they needed for chem/bio) for their fight against Iran some 20 years ago.  Does this make it right for them to use them? No, but just understand that we have many times supported those who have became our enemy.   And..No, I do not support Saddam, I hate him as much as you.  If we find weapons of mass destruction, then I fully support what our administration has already planned up and is already pulling the strings to execute.<br>
<br>
Joe-Thanks for the line by line drivel of what a symptom is and the constant &quot;coward&quot; this, &quot;coward that.  I'm honored by the fact that you served in the military and I'm sure you served our country well, but that doesn't make you &gt; me.  And, yes, Dr.joe, if I have symptoms of a cold or disease, I will go to you.  After all, without symptoms what does it matter if you have a cold or disease?  At least you're not suffering through the bullshit which symptoms put you through. <br>
