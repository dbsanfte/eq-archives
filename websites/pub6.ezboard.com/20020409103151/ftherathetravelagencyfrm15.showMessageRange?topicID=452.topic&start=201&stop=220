src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: A question for SoT (like I'll get an answer)</span><hr size=1> Greetings,<br>
<br>
First off I would like to introduce myself.. I am Malidar. A member of sot for about 1.5 years, and over 2 years on server maybe 2.5. I have seen many things in the rathe, good and bad.<br>
<br>
My presence in SF on that day. When I log into game early eastern time there is a message, that Ragefire is up. We went over about 2h or more, after i had been xping when the tracker had saw it during a passing. I dont know what transpired, however I could tell that over the time - contact was tried and met for a long time - with the people in the zone. So after a while - and talk in /gu about it... (mind you shei was not online till 3 -5 minutes prior to engagement), we began to move.<br>
<br>
It turns out that we went in - and had the mob mezzed - we were in zone, waiting with the mob mezzed for 25-30 mins with 8 of us, awaiting more people. At that point communication was still trying to be made.<br>
<br>
The guild as a whole probably 90 percent of them had no idea of a ragefire list. on site, prolly only 1 - 2 people knew of this list. I being one of them. This list however, is not an active list - nor a rotation so to speak. It is a gentleman's agreement foresay.<br>
<br>
Prior to this gentleman's agreement - they had the same type of agreement however no list. When i was up to ragefire i would zone into solb /ooc anyone camping ragefire?, if responces were made - then I left, and then finally when no answer - i camped this mob. Clearing FG's to hold the spawn. BUT, it has always been known that a Feign Dead monk *cannot* hold a camp. If there was a monk in the dungeon FD and a cleric moved in clearing the FG's then it would be the new clerics camp - no matter what the issue was. And I used to read about it often.<br>
<br>
The facts of this are:<br>
1) contact was tried to be made<br>
2) time was passed before engagement (levlanna i consider you a good friend, however it was in conversation of /gu way before you are saying)<br>
3) General consensus on RTA was NO to the list <br>
4) You cannot claim a camp afk (for hours) [proven: Lodizal where i spent over 200+ hours loosing 6 spawns to different guilds who didnt respect my &quot;afk, camping lodizal&quot; away messages.]<br>
<br>
Now to Trompen, and TO CoN:<br>
<br>
I am a member of SOT. This name - has been carried out for many game years, and is a semi-big gamer guild (in comparison to BoTS which i consider Large Gamer Guild). Overall over the years we have done many things good (such as the numerous CR's in fear/hate/air, and helping people lots with epic works (chardok, finny, fear, ect.) We are not as bad - as the demons would like us to be. (you trolls will pick this apart i know). The bad things that we have done range from &quot;Perma-camping spawns&quot; (which is the same violin songs ALL servers have with 4 big guilds on them), not responding to Rots (which is not my cup of tea anyhow). <br>
<br>
This is our first test of stability though. Believe me as you will but there are many talks in /gu about what we did - and as a guild we will mend together stronger.<br>
<br>
You ask, why be lead by a guildleader such as Shei, who dishonours the server, and what it stands for?<br>
<br>
My answer, Behind the /who spirit of tunare, is a bunch of friends - that d help eachother, that do talk, that do group together, that do joke together and are a bunch of friends overall. He holds us together, as a friend - and makes decisions *WITH* the other officers to make our GUILD work as a whole. Overall I don't think he dishonours the server. He is a good leader.<br>
<br>
Whether this be wrong or right, i do apologize for hurting thrompen. His camp wasn't respected if you want to consider a camp which one is afk, a camp (which i dont, due to the many camps that i lost, one being that from CoN i believe lodizal, could be wrong but i was afk - and they got the kill [dont worry guys it happened lots, is my bad]).<br>
<br>
I have not justified what we did wrong. I do not feel it is - but i see many of your points valid and for that I do apologize. However, i do take responsibility for my actions on this date.<br>
<br>
Trompen, i will talk to you in /t's i promise, and kuras (leader of CoN) i will speak to you as well. I hope that in the end, a practical measure to make ends meet will be encountered.  My cleric will be available to you guys.<br>
<br>
Have a good game, <br>
Venerable Malidar Moonvail<br>
Spirit of Tunare<br>

I KNOW this post will get picked apart to satisfy your arguements, as with any post it is applyable to any situation you want with wording, and to be honest, it isnt directed toward you people that are anti SoT (darkoak, pulgray), it is designed for CoN, and especially Trompen.<br>

More then one has posted being part of that KS and was &quot; just following orders&quot; only to later regret thier actions. <br>
<br>
Please... find out your facts before posting BS. SoT came , they saw , they KSed. No amount of light shining will improve that. <br>
<br>
Might want to work on your timeline as well. 5 minutes after the kill Nycah was telling people RF was up for 2 hours , with her giving trompen tells the whole time. 10 minutes after that she was telling people RF was up for 5 hours , and she had given every cleric in the zone a tell. <br>

======================================== <br>
<br>
this isn't a flame. Its a direct slap in your face... to ANYONE so gutless and pathetic as to STEAL and epic. <br>
<br>
Shei , and others of SoT got repeated /tell , /shout /ooc and /say about trompen being VERY MUCH alive , VERY MUCH on the camp , and VERY MUCH engaged with it. <br>
<br>
your cornered with no excuse that will save your arse , so you remain silent. <br>
<br>
if people inside SoT disagree with what happened , WHY is Shei still a leader let alone an officer? By taking NO action against adverse behavior to what you believe your guild SHOULD do ..........simple equates to you agreeing with what that leader did/does. <br>

The above is a post I made on the SoT boards. They closed the thread started on thier boards to prevent flaming... go figure. <br>

<br>
I am not anti SoT. I am anti KS. <br>
<br>
That &quot; attempts to contact&quot; may or may not have been made , prior to my getting there I have no knowledge of. I do how ever know that attempts were made at contact... on bahalf of CoN and by CoN! That /say /tell /shout /ooc were used and all ignored. <br>
<br>
That someone did finally attempt to make amends is commendable. That it was NOT a SoT guild leader , nor someone speaking on thier behalf , is disheartening. <br>
<br>
I do honestly hope SoT does the right thing. How ever I am not going to be holding my breath while listening for that loud POP... which will be Shei's head coming out of his arse.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udorakran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorakran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/24/02 12:18:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: SoT just following orders</span><hr size=1> to quote...<br>

<br>
and what i find MOST interesting (don't get me wrong, i think Trompen was horribly and maliciously maligned) - what i find MOST interesting is that the ALT who was to get the epic to begin with is the ALT of NYCA HERSELF. she who helps admin this very board, and who has ignored every request to delete the Ragefire forum, despite MANY requests to do so.  it is rather obvious from the Ragefire &quot;yay/nay&quot; and &quot;delete this forum&quot; and such that the majority of those who read the RTA board DO NOT WANT THE LIST.  <br>
<br>
sot themselves didn't honor the list, and this should be grounds enough to remove it completely.<br>

I have thought about this myself and wonder if it can be done. It seems SoT uses it to their advantage almost to the point that 1 would think Nyca's standing behind the RF Rot was just to make people feel somewhat safe when in fact they (Nyca and SoT) planned to use it to calculate their swooping in for a KS. <p>There are many good reasons for drinking.
One just popped into my head.

We are still trying to work out details.<br>
<br>
When Trompen told me about the toon &quot;noepictromp&quot; that was sending him tells I immediately told the guild and a guildleader said that if it turned out to be someone from SoT they would be removed.  Posting that it was a member of SoT when even we have no clue who it was is nothing but irresponsible.<br>
<br>
The only reason I am posting this is because of idiotic statements like this-<br>
<br>
&quot;Considering that they refuse to make any statement here but don't seem to shy to post on their own boards, why not bring the mountain to Mohammed?&quot;<br>
<br>
There is a reason we aren't shy to post on our own board.....<br>
we are taking care of this IN-GUILD.  We are not posting our every move on the RTA.  It is our business, and the business of those involved.  If they want to keep you updated from now on let them.  Until then please stop using SoTs lack of response on a flame board as justification for saying we don't have any ethics or that we aren't taking any action.<br>

I am not speaking as an official of SoT, etc., etc.<br>

I for one have been far busier finding a way to &quot;repay&quot; the damage done, to &quot;repay&quot; the 10 days Trompen has lost by this. The time he put into this camp IS the main factor why I'm sure 99% of SoT has a bad feeling about what we did, and I'm quite positive we are doing lots of talking to find out how we can rectify our wrong.<br>
As usual though, the more people stand up and face their faults, the harder people will take it down. Well in this case we deserved it.<br>
I just hope there's a way to right this wrong. <br>

This effects the guilds reputation , and how other poeple will react to the guild. This act was done by a guild leader... and causing this much of a stir , one would expect that guild leader to at least stand up and defend his actions. Or acknowledge his intentions to simple KS anyone he feels like. <br>
<br>
I was there. I was involved. And I am affected , being a cleric waiting on his RF camp. Do I need to worry about SoT jumping my camp? How much longer will I have to wait while SoT farms RF for alts? If SoT is going to camp RF for Trompen , whose RF are they going to take? I am presently anticipating my RF camp , and moving my PC into the bathroom with a fridge and microwave , but in the event I should happen to blink... or ==gasp== not feel like answering a simple &quot;hi&quot; tell from someone I dont know... does this mean I am not camping RF?<br>
<br>
SoT's actions , and subsequent lack of action , prompt all these questions and more.  <br>
------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Brumpy , its good to know some SoTs are working to resolve this. I had a few contact me ingame asking particulars about the RF camp. They even volunteered to sit the camp and kill the dragon , Tromp would just need to log in and loot. For the action of the MEMBERs , if they are followed through , thats commendable. Thanks for doing the right thing =D<br>
<br>
Are the guild LEADERS perchance involved in these talks? Is Shei involved at all other then to deny any wrong doing outside of ignoring everyone on the server not SoT?<br>

Deep down you know this.  Deep down every person who participated in killing Ragefire that day *knows* this now.<br>
<br>
Some don't care, some probably think it's cool.. but the fact is.. those that participated know this.<br>
<br>
I have no desire to bandwagon, but this act was wrong in the context of an online community that the Rathe has tried to become.<br>
<br>
Offering help after stepping on Trompen is a backhanded favor at best.<br>
<br>
It's a pity that EQ as a community has very few ways to make individuals and organizations accountable for their actions... ultimately this is just text on a message board.<br>
<br>
But speaking as an individual who has watched the Rathe evolve as a server since day 1, this was a very bad thing.  Not bad in a Terms of Service or Policy way, SoT did little to nothing that is *officially* against rules... but they did do ALOT wrong by the what the community has worked to achieve.<br>
<br>
PS: Morf, I appreciate the compliment.. but no thanks, I would prefer to be lumped into the category with the rest of KIC leadership. I am one of those 12 founders, and imo we've tried the best we could in KIC. We weren't always right, but you don't see us running over another guild.  I've always considered you a nice guy, but I've got to say.. I am pretty disappointed if you took part in this.<br>

Would you betray your guild who has always made sure that every day there's an event waiting? Who have given you items that advance you significantly, who worked together to conquer common goals, who are at the end of the day still just human beings...<br>
Leaving SoT would seem to me like being a rat jumping off the sinking ship, it's not an act of honor, it's an act of disloyalty and a slap in the face to anyone in the guild, because what being in a high end guild, be it NB/TL/bots/SoT or several other upcoming guilds, means is that you have stronger/more advanced characters, but it is impossible to get that far without a strong and likeminded group of people who are doing all to set new goals for themselves, and award people for their time spent.<br>
So, I doubt there will be more people leaving SoT, but instead of seeing this as an indication that we are the evil empire we're being told to be, it should be an indication that we, as a whole, are willing to take the blame, are willing to show that we were wrong and mostly, that we will try together to right this wrong.<br>
Malidar's post already said it, our leadership is talking to CoN, and Trompen specifically, to come up with a way to &quot;repay&quot; what was done wrong.<br>
For those that don't believe in righting your wrongs, I hope you never make a mistake you'll regret, because either you are an extremist or use double standards... or haven't you ever done anything you regretted? <p>Brumpy Bronzefinger<br>
