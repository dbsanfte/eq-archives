I responded that we DO infact do that (common courtesy). I never said the only reason nb gets mobs is cause we let you, lol... somewhat doubt we can kill every mob + ntov on patch day. I said that in a direct race for a certain mob - we can beat you (without time zone advantage)... not trying to dick wave, emphasizing my point that we don't rush for every mob if we see a guild is there.<br>
<br>
Yes we only have from 3-7pm est as our FULL FORCE raiding hours.. loads of mobs don't take full force (zland kland 350 dain sont vind statue etc etc).<br>
<br>
As for Zland, there will be no double standards. There are loads of mobs in ntov we may think we can kill + we should obviously be put on rotation since we've killed harder mobs... but no rotation till they are dead by us. <p><br><br><center><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=2.5><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=29210">Haxx Valoras</a><br>

They are said over and over and over, as if repeating them will make 1 become 3 and 3 become 7.  Just how many times did we &quot;run over&quot; anyone?  <br>
<br>
I see NB say Keldor, I see TL say Zland.  I see NB bring up an unfortunate act that was done by a guest in the home of a SoT player, what is it now? 2 years ago?, that has been apologized for, and amends trying to be made, but we never had that item drop again. <br>
<br>
I see no mention of the times that SoT was run over, around, rushed, etc.  Why?  Cause we close out those incidents, and move on.  We don't bring them out as a justification of any wrong-doing.  <br>
<br>
If we do do wrong, we take our lumps, move on, and vow to ourselves not to have it happen again.<br>
<br>
I see lots of guilds here, patting themselves on the back for helping others.  SoT helps others too, but you know what?  We don't brag about it.  We just like to help.<br>
<br>
How many times did we *race* to a mob, see that NB had a few more there than we did, so we just backed away and left.  I guess our problem was that we didn't *tell* NB that we were doing it, and didn't wait around for &quot;atta boys&quot;.  We just left.  <br>
<br>
When we *race* for mobs, and lose out over and over, we don't come whining to these board for peer pressure.  We just keep trying until we do win.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uumbali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Umbali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/28/01 7:49:01 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/umbali/myhomepage/index/image/eq000025.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rotations</span><hr size=1> I think this wont get resolved....having your actions judged and finding out that other people see a different side to them based upon perhaps what their own needs were...well sucks.<br>
<br>
I think SoT has been in that position on this board lately and whether you agree or not  no matter which guild you happen to be in...thats life.<br>
<br>
Guilds in competition to each other will cause hurt feelings..and no matter how good a guild GM is  or how hard he tries to maintain order..you cant control the tells that guild mates send..to think so would be insane.<br>
<br>
Even tho NB could kill Zland...imo  they still need to go do it.  We are having to do that exact same things in Ntov.  Thats the precedent thats been set.  In some instances it doesnt seem fair ..but again..thats life.<br>

<br>
I've noticed that you take responsibility for speaking for NB all the time.  If it is something official from NB, it must come from you.  Unfortunately there are lots of members in NB and they don't just stay quiet.  They give their opinions good or bad.<br>
<br>
The same way Vligon, Leezord, and any other VoFs speak effects the way you feel about us...the same works for how members of NB speak.  I'm sure lots of arguing in this thread is directly related to things you have said...but lots is also due to things other NBs said at the raid, or since then.  You can't expect us not to react to what people say just because it wasn't from you.<br>
<br>
The VoF/NB Sev discussion can end from me now.  I hope our two guilds can avoid any similar situations in the future<br>

Gathering your guild and racing off to a mob, even with the thought you might not get it, is appealing to me.  It's fun, but, rotations prove to be more beneficial so that everyone gets their fair share.  &quot;If you're not on the rotation, kill the mob to get on it&quot; has become the standard.  I understand about time differences, but that's an added obstacle one must overcome to slay such mobs in order to reap the benefits.<br>

<br>
Every time a SOT representative posts a message here its full of lies, double standards and misinformation. I've seen several of their officers in these threads clearly state &quot;get a force to X mob and claim it try a shot at it and we'll respect that!&quot; Horseshit.... I remember when my guild had 24 - 30 people in sleeper was obviously killing the gollums and Bottom feeders of tunare continued to bring more and more players into the zone. This was while 2 of their &quot;officers&quot; were in the zone and yet they continued to bring more people. The same officers are spewing out lies left and right here.<br>
<br>
Pretty much any post you see from a SOT membership in a &quot;leadership&quot; position can be skipped over as it's been proven time and time again here that it's just several paragraphs of lies and double standards.<br>

<br>
Here, let me add a little meat to Mistabone's post if I may =).<br>
<br>
Everyone remember a month or so ago when there was this big blow out about the fact that SoT didn't even have the courtesy to hold off on killing Statue (which ofcourse they secured thnx timezone edge) until 9 EST so that BotS could have a crack at the AoW?  Remember SoT's explanation when they were flamed for this?  Need I post links?  In summary, about five SoTs or so moaned and cried about how their poor, poor little guild only had a four hour window of time to raid since they had so many Europeans and that they just couldn't wait so darn late!!! OMG 9 EST!!!  <br>
<br>
So sure enough, our poor lil SoT, who couldn't hold Statue off until 9 EST as a MINOR courtesy to BotS so that BotS could try AoW because, according to Ghei and others, 9 EST was just too late at night for them, has now for the last two weeks in a row fielded well over 50 members well past 10 pm EST for its NToV raids.  Wasn't that Koi Doken dying to the SoT zerg patrol at 10:30 EST last night?  BUT!! BUT!!<br>
<br>
I have the time stamped screenies of that too, and honestly, if I cared more, I would put together a collage of links to the lies spewing from SoT mouths and these pictures as unequivocal evidence backing Mistabone's claims that SoT's leadership is as slimy and slippery as a stank infested fish.<br>
<br>
In sum, gratz SoT on your NToV successes and all this other nonsense that took you over a year and a major tank boost patch to do, but the simple fact is that your leaders are greedy and they lie, and it reflects upon all of you.  Even minor courtesies are ignored, then bullshitted away with lies and more lies.  Your flames are well deserved.<br>
<br>
Now rather than any comments on the merits, we can expect the random assortment of chimp responses and deflections from the SoT puke patrol.  Have at it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usss0rn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sss0rn</A> at: 11/28/01 11:42:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uumbali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Umbali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/28/01 1:30:16 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hometown.aol.com/umbali/myhomepage/index/image/eq000025.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rotations</span><hr size=1> Sssorn what you fail to realize is...why would SoT people in other time zones want to stay up way later than is prudent to benifit Bots?  Its one thing to ask guild members to suck it up and stay up late for Ntov when its our first few times there , but entirely different for us to expect people to stay up later just so you can get waxed by the AoW. ( no that isnt a slight cus i know we could do no better against him)<br>
<br>
In light of us stepping aside a few weeks ago so you could try him , I would thnk you would have the class to stop whining about the time we didnt.<br>
<br>
For someone that doesnt care very much you sure do take enuf time to make sure in every single thread you have to mention the time zone sploiting.  Its kinda pathetic that originally all you professed to care about was working together and getting things on rotation and settling the issue of time zone differences.  Now that mobs are on rotation and people are for the most part attempting to work together you still bitch and whine and make inflammatory comments.<br>
<br>
If you want to be taken seriously and actually make progress in all this then try and temper your hatred with some reason.  The arguments are getting old as is the finger pointing.  From ALL sides.<br>
<br>
Personally it will be nice when SOL comes out and theres more content for people to kill...until we all get log jammed again somewhere and start new fights over mobs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Since the effort is now being made to negate time zone differences  how bout either giving it a rest  or just admit your an idiot with a fixation on that issue.<br>

No no, it's you that can't be trusted, it's you who lie, it's your members who will start discussions in /ooc about how we should leave NToV to kill tormax so you can get some looty, it's you, and many others have witnessed it now.<br>
<br>
We haven't killed the statue in like what? 3 weeks? Plenty of time to zerg that AoW to kingdom come if you ask me, but nooo, let's bring up this senseless point and mold it into another meaningless flame.<br>
<br>
What's next? Got any more rubbage you can tell to all these people about us? Go on, tell 'm we're gimps, tell 'm we take your precious EQ mobs because *GASP* 25% of our members live in Europe, tell 'm how we &quot;exploited&quot; Yelinak, I'm sure they care, I'm sure it'll alter their lives in a way you can't imagine, it's all so very important. <br>
<br>
Stop crying about us please before you make me feel sorry for you.<br>
<br>

Hi.  After you guys killed Aary the first time then tried Feshlak 3 times unsuccessfully then logged out we cleared the rest of the dragons.  By the discussions we (me, Shei, and Emil) had over the previous week, it was clear that when you guys left, we were going to kill whatever else was up.  You guys left, we killed what was left up.  There was no rotation/reservation on them.  I'm not sure what you say we &quot;lied&quot; about here and what we couldn't be trusted.<br>
<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hi again.  No one suggested that you leave ToV-N to kill Tormax.  I (yes, it was me who started the conversation) started using /ooc to attempt to talk to someone who wouldn't keep trying to talk in circles about the simple question of whether you guys were going to kill Tormax before the 24 hours was up as per the rotation agreement or were going to pass.  I expected an answer of something one of the following:  &quot;we are going to stay in ToV-N now and will kill him later, within the rotation agreement&quot; or &quot;we are going to pass on tormax&quot;.  After speaking with one SoT member for some time in /tells, that person repeatedly and specifically said he would not answer that question in either of those forms and, in fact, wouldn't tell me what SoT's plan was at all.  I wanted a simple answer so we could plan our night so I asked in /ooc to speak to someone who could/would talk to me about it.  Instead, SoT's general response in /ooc was that they would not answer it in /ooc either to take it to /tells, which I simply stated that I had been trying already for quite some time and got tired of runaround/non-answer.  Eventually, Karadoc spoke to me directly and agreed to meet later in the night to talk, which Emil, Karadoc, Thundaron, Shei, Haxx, and I did.  The resolution on Tormax was that Shei, Thundaron, Haxx, and Karadoc promised and agreed multiple times to us that they would have Tormax killed by 1pm Eastern time today.  We also discussed some ToV-N issues.<br>

What does all this have to do with Bots apart from the fact that you're so stinking pissed that we can kill mobs that were yours alone since SoV came out... hmmm?<br>
<br>
When has any SoT sank so low to post screenshots on noows?<br>
When have we started giving funny names to your members? I mean calling Shei Ghei must have taken like the full 4 seconds of mental brainstorm to come up with a beauty like that.<br>
And lastly, do we ever mention BotS as anything but BotS? I mean bottom feeders of tunare is funny and all, bet you're proud of that one. Before Furor came none of you even knew what a bottom feeder is. But hey, you can talk the talk, good for you<br>
<br>
No no, all you guys are about is belittling us because your dicks are obviously bigger, heck soon my GF will start to believe it and leave me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Nice try to justify your actions though, too bad like 150 people saw you crying in ToV for some attention, and they saw the silence after we mentioned that BotS itself doesn't respect the 24 hour kill thing, hello double standards. We don't need people telling us when we have to kill mob x, we'll make that call ourselves thank you.<br>
<br>
Also, yes, BotS was fully in its right to clear NToV after we kill Aaryonar, it's the game, I merely stated that it won't happen again, in fact, when we &quot;used&quot; BotS Aaryo kill to venture into NToV for our first time we were called bottom feeders, when BotS &quot;uses&quot; our Aaryo for the same reason you're not? explain to me in what way? Apart from the fact that we hadn't killed Aaryo yet when we did that CoH move, what makes your guild better than mine? It's time to shake off some of those nice nicknames you gave us as they don't really apply anymore.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I've had it with BotS' empty meaningless flames, I can retort to anything you've thrown at us so far, what's next? more lies? more screenshots? more nicknames? Bring it on.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Am i to interpret this as a formal declaration of FFA?<br>
<br>
or do you not understand that a rotation is a mutual agreement with rules that we all adhere to? ie, we all agree to tell when mobs shoul be killed, and all agree to follow that, or to pass till next time around...<br>
<br>
When a mob is exclusively rotated between 2 parties (like sot/bots) the 24h is not nearly an issue. (like king t / yeli 2 weeks ago and beyond)<br>
<br>
when more enter the rotation, it becomes vastly more important.<br>
<br>
added to the fact the shei, thundaron, karadoc and haxx all said last night that king t would be dead by 1pm or they would pass.. and now its 5pm and you all are still trying / killing him...<br>
<br>
shows me who is to be trusted.<br>

Let me spell it out for you gimp:<br>
<br>
1. Back before any flame wars, when even I was on speaking terms with Ghei, I asked SoT to hold off on Statue until 9 EST so that BotS could try AoW after.<br>
2. SoT blew this request off.<br>
3. SoT's explanation?  &quot;We only have a four hour window when we can raid given our European crew, so 9 EST is too late at night.&quot;<br>
4. Flash to now, where suddenly SoT is raiding NToV for 10 hours straight on weekdays and fielding crews of over 50 people well past 10 EST.<br>
<br>
So what is this a simple example of?  The fact that your guild leaders have no sack, and resort to lies.  They can't just admit that, even when we were purportedly on good terms (before I ever flamed SoT) that SoT just chose to @#%$ BotS over on this TINY courtesy among several others, but instead had to resort to a batch of lies, and general bullshit to cover ass, much as you are doing now.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of your ill-conceived post, sorry, but you'll have to do better than that to deflect attention away from the fact that yes, your guild's leaders are lying gimps.  The proof is in the pudding.<br>
<br>
Oh and Umbali, I give you credit for a relatively well reasoned post, and I won't flame a guy who has the sack to stick to the merits, but let me respond:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   In light of us stepping aside a few weeks ago so you could try him , I would thnk you would have the class to stop whining about the time we didnt.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First, get your facts straight.  We didn't ask SoT to step aside that time, we merely asked that they hold off until 9 EST.  Big difference.  SoT still got the statue didn't it?  THought so.<br>
<br>

In all these flames, I see the same few instances that SoT was in the wrong. They are said over and over and over, as if repeating them will make 1 become 3 and 3 become 7. Just how many times did we &quot;run over&quot; anyone?   -- Nycah<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
Bullshit, I will now list the major issues/treatment I have had with SoT in the past year (since the change).  It isn't 1 becoming 3, and 3 becoming 7.  The list below are just the MAJOR issues, and they're some pretty damn serious ones.  You guys chose to try and crucify us for doing the same thing every other guild does at Sev - Race.  You then managed to talk about hypocrisy with a straight face, while your leadership has been busy over the past year doing such doozies as listed below.<br>
<br>
A little history first:<br>
<br>
NB and SoT used to do a ton of stuff together, PoG raids, VS raids (even teaming up when there WEREN'T guilds racing SoT for it - just to do it for the fun and friendship), hell Nycah, you, Thundaron and others were even caming to our Hate and Fear raids a year ago.  I also remember 2-3 Sevs SoT and NB did jointly back in the day (irony of ironies).  Since then, I've seen nothing but a desire to be uber and seeing insulting others and walking over people as the only way to get there.  No room for friends at the top it seems.<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
I see NB say Keldor, I see TL say Zland. I see NB bring up an unfortunate act that was done by a guest in the home of a SoT player, what is it now? 2 years ago?, that has been apologized for, and amends trying to be made, but we never had that item drop again.  -- Nycah<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
Nycah, please, less dishonesty.  Severillous and Kunark didn't exist 2 years ago.  Sorry, the ninjalooting at Sev happened no more than 5-6 months ago, and was the last time we raced SoT.  I never griped about it then, and let it go unbitched about.  But if you think I'm going to watch SoT act like this again and again and just &quot;forget about it&quot; - sorry wrong answer.<br>
<br>
Now the *recent past*<br>
CT Rotation.  We were told to get on, you have to beat one of us to him.  FFA fear day with CT up, and we get invited to go by Falcon Star.  Yay, our chance at last to prove ourselves, even if it was on CT 2.0, while SoT got to cut its teeth on CT 1.0 and 1.5.  I was told in *no* uncertain terms that we were NOT to kill a mob we weren't on rotation for, and if we did so, we would never see Trakanon again.  How could a guild like SoT make good on that threat?  By using their &quot;non-existent&quot; time advantage.  I wasn't told this by some random member either, but by Thundaron, an officer at the time and I believe, still.<br>
<br>
Perma-killing Scout.  Anderas in all his spitefulness would train Scout to ToV and kill him just to deny us the chance to do the Benevolence quests.  This was over a period of two weeks, and until we petitioned him for it, SoT did nothing to our repeated requests for him to leave a 12 hour spawning quest mob alone.<br>
<br>
Keldor.  On two separate occasions we CoHed 10-12 folks into the bank, started clearing to Keldor.  A few SoT would see us, and minutes later their own 10-12 folks would come running from the zone and kill him right in front of us.  On the first such occasion, we were told &quot;We only need one or two more, and then you can have him.&quot;  This was from a guild officer.  That kind of attitude to me says, &quot;After we get all we want, you can have whatever you want.&quot;  That isn't what sharing means.  That isn't what common courtesy looks like.  After explaining how wrong it was, and being told it wouldn't happen again, it did, not 3 weeks later.  Guild leaders of SoT were present at BOTH occurences.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to list Zland or any issues BOTS has with you guys, because they aren't my beefs.  Nor am I going to list all the stupid little @#%$ your members do, after all they are just members and everyone has a right to hate who they want and proclaim it where they want).  I've focused in the above list on things your LEADERSHIP was involved in.  NB didn't just wake up one morning and decide we didn't like SoT anymore.  We got there, because you drove, and we're not tipping you for the ride.<br>
<br>
 I will comment that adding those complaints to these, makes me think, if I had an SoT tag, I would be *very* concerned about what is going on.  Sure, every one of these issues has a second side to it, even if its a simple &quot;That was @#%$ up on our part&quot;, but where there's this much smoke, there is bound to be some fire.  SoT and NB used to be friends, now we avoid you like the plague.<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
I see no mention of the times that SoT was run over, around, rushed, etc. Why? Cause we close out those incidents, and move on. We don't bring them out as a justification of any wrong-doing.   -- Nycah<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
No one justified any wrongdoing.  Racing to Sev last week wasn't wrong.  End of story.  We didn't train, we didn't KS, we didn't pressure VoF.<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
If we do do wrong, we take our lumps, move on, and vow to ourselves not to have it happen again.  -- Nycah<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Like the first or second time at Keldor?  Bottom line, you *haven't* changed how you treat us.  Your only saving grace is we hardly run into you thanks to time zone differences.  That is what it takes for you all to treat us with a bit of respect it seems.<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
I see lots of guilds here, patting themselves on the back for helping others. SoT helps others too, but you know what? We don't brag about it. We just like to help.  -- Nycah<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
No, we aren't patting ourselves on the back.  You accused us of having no respect for smaller guilds, tried to sully our reputation, so we countered with our evidence of being a helpful guild.  THAT is our reputation.  You don't see us post on our News Updates &quot;Hey look at us helping so-and-so again!!  We're so Great and Wonderful!&quot;  You attacked us for being a &quot;big nasty guild that has no respect for the smaller guilds of the server&quot; and I just showed you how much bullshit was spewing from your mouths.  No back-patting.<br>
<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
How many times did we *race* to a mob, see that NB had a few more there than we did, so we just backed away and left. I guess our problem was that we didn't *tell* NB that we were doing it, and didn't wait around for &quot;atta boys&quot;. We just left.   --Nycah<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
Never Nycah.  That is my exact point.  Not once.  If SoT has been in the zone in any kind of force, you have made every effort to move in and with pressure.  Last time I saw NB and SoT at VS (this was Spring 2001 - not 2 years ago).  Rara is at zone with 3 SoT, I am in CY with 14 NB, all the right classes.  8 more SoT show up a few minutes later, and he had the audacity to ask me &quot;Are you going to pull yet, because if not, we're moving in.&quot;  Backing off mobs my ass.<br>
Don't grab some occasion where you all are forming for Dain, you do a /who all GUILD &quot;noble&quot;, notice 40 of us in Kael and then use it as somehow &quot;SoT didn't rush you for Vindi&quot;.  It doesn't work that way.  Backing down means what you want it to mean - VoF has 11, we have 4 - please go away and let them have it.  11 isn't enough to kill Sev, especially not for the upgraded Wuoshi Stunning, Gating Sev, not by half.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
When we *race* for mobs, and lose out over and over, we don't come whining to these board for peer pressure. We just keep trying until we do win. --Nycah<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Same here, not once have I come here and complained about losing a race, even as much as I hate racing to mobs against anyone, big or small.  What you HAVE seen me do is throw back in your face these accusations that we were so evil for racing, when you all have done the exact same thing to us and others.  I will say for the 86243976374th time, either it IS OK, or is NOT OK to race for a mob.

Yes, we were in NToV until 10:30 EST last night.  Yes, it was like 7:30 am for a bunch of the euros on.  That was our first real trip to the back of NToV, and people pushed themselves to their max.  I'm sure a lot called in sick, stayed home, or whatever..but what makes you think that we should do that JUST because you want us to?  Give me a damn break.  We're not gonna ask anyone to stay up to 6am because you want to try AoW.  And yes, we DID step aside from the statue when we let ya get an AoW attempt in.  BoTS killed the mob, we just had a few there to get the faction.  Not like it matters, we were still given loot (yay reavers) and whatever, but comparing us not backing off statue to us being up late in NToV is foolish.  Because we have a good force on late for our *first trip to back ntov*, our leaders are liars and gimps.  You like to have drama, everyone knows that and it is no secret.  But you blow things out of proportion way too often.  You think we decided to kill statue and not wait, we are doing it to @#%$ bots over because we are evil people?  Funny.  You're just a moron if you think it is enjoyable for anyone to be on 'bad-terms' with BoTS.  You constantly call us zergs, gimps, and whatever else you can come up with..and personally, I think the only reason is because we killed *your* precious mobs in NToV.  I, for one, thought it was going better between the 2 guilds, with the newly formed rotations and stuff.  Yet you seem to not be able to let things go.<br>
<br>
&quot;gratz SoT on your NToV successes and all this other nonsense that took you over a year and a major tank boost patch to do&quot;<br>
<br>
Heh..what exactly is meant by that?  If it's trying to put us down for taking this long, shrug..not like I care in the least what you think.  But you are also insulting every other single person outside of BoTS, as nobody else has cleared NToV, or even killed a mob in it.  I think it gives you some sort of false pride the more you call us names and downplay whatever accomplishments we have.  We didn't use anything to be considered a questionable tactic in NToV, so you resort to how long it took us and what help we had through patches..gg.<br>
<br>
Fitten,<br>
The comments in ooc were more laughable and pathetic than anything to be taken seriously.  I for one had a laugh at the way you spammed ooc with the same sentance over and over, in a plee for attention.  You couldn't use tells..as you said you talked to shei and it got nowhere..I find it hard to believe, but, you can always talk to a different leader.  Asking like 6 times repeatedly in a zone of 200 people about a rotation between 2 guilds..is quite funny <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Mista, <br>
How long ago did that happen?  It was very early on in our sleepers career if I remember right.  Shrug, I wasn't even there at the time.  Did SoT kill 1 mob when you were there?  Did SoT attack 1 mob when you were there?  If they didn't, what really is your problem?  You are in the same boat as Sssorn, and you need to let things go.  That was probably a good 3 months ago or something..and yet that is the only thing you can bring up to dispute the &quot;have the force and we wouldn't bother you&quot; claim?  When have we went to a mob when someone else had a force?  With zland and tindi which i'm sure someone with no clue will bring up..we were both gathering at the same time, and tindi beat us down to him.  Bring up something else, I don't remember any others.  However i'm sure you will prove me wrong and post something I would have forgotten about.<br>
<br>
But anyways..to all..chill the @#%$ out. ;p <p>Lazreth Bonechiller<BR>
