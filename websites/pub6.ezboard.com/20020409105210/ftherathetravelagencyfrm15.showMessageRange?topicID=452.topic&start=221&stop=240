 Tompen, I am sure you will have a great deal of support when the next RF pops, but if you get into another bind you can shoot me a tell as well and I will drag anyone else I can with me to help.<br>
 <br>
 Sorry about what Shei&amp;Chronis did to you. I would never say sorry on anyone’s behalf, but Shei is Shei and you wont get an apology from him and you deserve at least that.<br>

Before you call us names I can state that I find stealing your character back by e-mailing Verant and having the password changed so you could get the character back you invested no time in is far lower than the lowest act ever possible in a game.<br>
You are the kind of person I was referring to, when it's you it's ok to do wrong, when it happens to you it's unforgivable...<br>
Nice double standard thief.<br>
You of all people should not post here telling who's wrong here when in fact your act has far more weight because it transpired in the real world, not a game.<br>

This may be coming from a guy who tired of mass punishment in basic training or just the unfairness of it, can't say which.<br>
<br>
What the few did &lt;I&gt;was&lt;/I&gt; wrong, but I personally cannot fault the entire guild for it.  As for their lack of response...  That is their choice; I wouldn't post about this either if I were in their shoes, because it would hacked apart by everyone who reads these boards and that is not productive nor helpful for the partys involved.  That and a show of solidarity is very important at this time.  Yes this is just a game, but is loyalty any less important here than in RL?  No, loyaltly is a measure of who we are.  <br>
<br>
Everybody is upset, as am I, but now is the time to right what has transpired.  We as a community need to allow SoT and CoN to work this out between themselves.  Yes it effects us all in some way, but if this thread is any indication I highly doubt this will ever repeat itself on the Rathe.<br>
<br>
Maybe we need to revise just the Rage camp to allow for periods of AFK... I mean c'mon a weeks worth of sitting at the monitor watching for a dragon that will pop in a week?  This needs to be looked at in a constuctive manner by &lt;I&gt;leaders&lt;/I&gt; of all guilds.  Some resolution to this horrid camp can be reached by all that is benificial to all.  <br>
<br>
To this end I urge the admins of this board to create a forum for just such a thing.  Those that have rights as leaders should be allowed to post... and for that matter read.  When an outcome that has been reached by the leaders of guilds, then open up the forum for all to see.  Just a suggestion, but something in someway needs to be done.<br>
<br>
Ok, enough of this... i'm going on and on...<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;Hehe, I don't see from what standard you guys approach leaving guilds, but in a high end guild it's very inappropriate to leave behind those that helped you advance in the game to where you are now. <br>
Would you betray your guild who has always made sure that every day there's an event waiting? Who have given you items that advance you significantly, who worked together to conquer common goals, who are at the end of the day still just human beings...<br>
Leaving SoT would seem to me like being a rat jumping off the sinking ship, it's not an act of honor, it's an act of disloyalty and a slap in the face to anyone in the guild, because what being in a high end guild, be it NB/TL/bots/SoT or several other upcoming guilds, means is that you have stronger/more advanced characters, but it is impossible to get that far without a strong and likeminded group of people who are doing all to set new goals for themselves, and award people for their time spent. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Basically here what you are saying here is that because SoT gave me loot then I should stay with them forever more? Do you seriously think that this is the FIRST time SoT did anything I disagreed with? no way lol this was the last straw.  All I can say is I had more thought for my RL priciples and dignity than I did for some loot from a guild. Yes nevermore will I be able to get loot from a NToV mob, I won't see my blackstar or the range item I would have like.d...so what? pitch that against my honor and dignity. I would choose to leave again over and over.<br>
<br>
It really doesn't matter how far up the ladder you advance Brumpy if you got there on the back of a shite leadership.<br>
<br>
Yes I gained some very nice loot while with SoT excellent gear but I worked damn hard for it as well. Staying up all night on many many occasions raiding till 5 or 6am regulary. Not leaving raids when they are half over. I worked my butt off for SoT.<br>
<br>
I was sad to leave because until they started behaving as they did I loved SoT I supported them through every incident previously, I gave them my all, but this was too much, this was the end.<br>
<br>
You are now coming out and saying we did was wrong Brumpy but thats very diff to the abuse you gave me in /gu about our choice not to support what SoT did.<br>
<br>
If you say SoT are now wrong, then why was Dwallyns post wrong? because he broke rank and decided to tell the truth? I can tell you now it about time someone did, it was long overdue.<br>
<br>
Btw does Shei know you posting? I saw him tell you not to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And finally a telling  quote that sums it all up <br>
<br>
 A_Guild_Leader003 tells the guild, 'what happened today was nothing really'<br>
<br>
As far as I have been told and see SoT  has a few members who feel bad about this.The rest maybe feel ashamed but wont say .To say first that  SoT did no wrong and now try and salvage some   respect  by saying SoT are dealing with it is laughable. When I left and stated that SoT were in wrong , guys like Frumpy were the first to jump on me ,saying  &quot;we are better of not having guys like them that arent dedicated&quot;<br>
Bullshite.<br>
<br>
During the Second World War soldiers on all sides did thing they did want to  or disagreed to.In the end tho when it was all over ,they still had to answer to their actions.Stand up and be counted ffs.If this was a political leadership you guy would have them out.This is a game yet you seem cowed and afraid of certain members and officers in SoT. If SoT did wrong and I said that in first place then why arent  I in right now?? /boggle. Its all OK cause you are &quot;fixing it&quot; ? I still see no official SoT leader statement  condemming the action and apologising to CoN and Trompen.<br>
<br>
By turning this on others  by saying shite like  &quot; we gave loot you left wahhhhhhh&quot; you  just showed what an ass you truley are lol.We all new that this would get worse lol  and  some would post crap to  deflect everyone onto me and Galudina and CoN. Wont work this time.<br>

My dear friend in SoT (you know who you are), are these the logs you referred to that proved you guys were justified?  If so, I really don't know who you are anymore.  I always knew you as a kind, considerate person who would help anyone and would NEVER stand for this garbage.  Do you really support this kind of behavior?  Do you really think Trompen deserved to be s'hit on like this?  Would you feel the same way if it had been one of your friends or you?<br>

He is never gonna see all the nasty names you called him and stuff.<br>
<br>
And now, without any silliness, my opinion on this situatuion.<br>
<br>
1.) About the RF Kill. All I can say is it wasn't very cool, but it looks sketchy as to whether or not they knew about the long camp. And also about the &quot;agreements&quot; after the change to Ragefire. One would auotmaticly assume a change with the change to the quest. So, in conclusion I see no wrong done, some hurt feelings and a disheartened cleric yes, but in the end it boils down to rules, and there were no rules broken.<br>
<br>
2.) Bout Dwallyn and Galudina. Anyone is free to leave any guild at any time they wish and for any reason. The loot (crap) that is given to someone by their guild, is considered reward for a job well done. Thus, the awardee has earned the loot and is obligated in no way to continue earning something they have already earned.<br>
<br>
<br>

But this is where the gloves come off, I've tried nothing but making amends, I will do anything it takes so that we might regain even the slightest bit of respect, but you're just pouring more oil on the fire... well here's a piece of your own...<br>
<br>
You can all see Dwallyn's self righteous posts here, and I can see how you think he's the hero now, but it's so far from true...<br>
Dwallyn will use you at his will, if you can do something for him he'll be your friend, when you no longer suit his plans he drops you like a brick, and to top it off he'll get a nice big hammer and try to pulverize the brick too...<br>
A couple days ago you kissed Shei's ass for getting Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying, as did you for every piece of loot you got, loot is what kept you quiet and it worked for a while... but it looks like now you have full kael armor and some assorted other high end items that you must leave us and seek something less challenging but allows you to show your greatness... after all you're uber now right? Enjoy it.<br>
Today you decide not only to turn your back on us but to kick us when we're down. Bad form.<br>
Enjoy the moment where everyone seems to think you're heroes, in the end they'll learn you would whore yourself for anything, you'd stoop as low as posting private messages and guildchat and you'll do it again once you think you've leeched enough from your next guild.<br>
Had this been for your epic you wouldn't make this big deal out of it, but now you feel like you're the hero of the Rathe don't you... Good luck with it, and good luck to the guild that will take your kind.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you can tell these people where I was when RF got killed, but I still take full responsibility for my guild, it's called loyalty, now @#%$ off you're ruining my mood, filthy sellout.<br>
