<br>
The Price Of Pansyhood<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 A few unorganized thoughts regarding the events in New York:<br>
<br>
We lost.  Our moral posturing about our degradation is merely embarrassing.  We have been made fools of, expertly and calculatedly, in the  greatest military defeat the country has suffered since we fled from  Viet Nam.  The Moslem world is laughing and dancing in the streets. The rest of the earth, while often sympathetic, sees us as the weak and helpless  nation that we are.   The casualty figures aren't in, but 10,000 dead seems reasonable,and  we wring our hands and speak of grief therapy. We lost.<br>
<br>
We cannot stop it from happening again.Thousands of aircraft constantly useO'Hare, a few minutes flying time  from the Sears Tower.<br>
<br>
 Our politicians and talking heads speak of &quot;a cowardly act of terrorism.&quot; It was neither cowardly nor, I think, terrorism.  Hijacking an aircraft and driving it into a building isn't cowardly.  Would you do it? It requires great courage and dedication -- which our  enemies have, and we do not. One may mince words, but to me the attack  looked like an act of war. Not having bombing craft of their own, they  used ours. When we bombed Hanoi and Hamburg, was that terrorism?<br>
<br>
The attack was beautifully conceived and executed.  These guys were good. They were clearly looking to inflict the maximum humiliation on the United  States, in the most visible way possible, and they did. The sight of those  two towers collapsing will leave nobody's mind. If we do nothing of  importance in return, and it is my guess that we won't, the entire earth  will see that we are a nation of epicenes. Silly cruise-missile attacks on  Afghanistan will just heighten the indignity.<br>
<br>
 In watching the coverage, I was struck by the tone of passive acquiescence. Not once, in hours of listening, did I hear anyone express anger. No one  said, coldly but in deadly seriousness, &quot;People are going to die for this,  a whole lot of people.&quot; There was talk of tracking down bin Laden and  bringing him to justice. &quot;Terrorism experts&quot; spoke of months of investigation  to find who was responsible, which means we will do nothing. Blonde bimbos babbled of coping strategies and counseling and how our children needed support. There was no talk of retaliation.<br>
<br>
 The Israelis, when hit, hit back. They hit back hard.  But Israel is run by men. We are run by women. Perhaps two-thirds of the  newscasters were blonde drones who spoke of the attack over and over as a  tragedy, as though it had been an unusually bad storm ….unfortunate, but inevitable, and now we must get on with our lives. The experts and politicians, nominally male, were effeminate and soft  little things. When a feminized society runs up against male enemies -- and bin Laden, whatever else he is, is a man -- it loses. We have. <br>
<br>
 We haven't conceded that the Moslem world is our enemy, nor that we are at war. We see each defeat and humiliation in isolation, as a unique incident  unrelated to anything else. The 241 Marines killed by the truck bomb in Beirut,  the extended humiliation of the hostages taken by Iran, the war with Iraq,  the bombing of the Cole, the destruction of the embassies in Kenya and  Tanzania, the devastation of the Starke, the Saudi barracks, the dropping  of airliner after airliner -- these we see as anecdotes, like pileups  of cars on a snowy road. They see these things as war. We face an enemy  more intelligent than we are.<br>
<br>
 We think we are a superpower.  Actually we are not, except in the useless sense of having nuclear weapons.  We could win an air war with almost anyone, yes, or a naval war in mid-Pacific.  Few Americans realize how small our forces are today, how demoralized and  weakened by social experimentation. If we had to fight a ground war in  terrain with cover, a war in which we would take casualties, we would lose.<br>
<br>
 I have heard some grrr-woofwoofery about how we should invade Afghanistan and teach those ragheads a lesson. Has anyone noticed where Afghanistan is? How would we get there? Across Pakistan, a Moslem country? Or through India? Do we suppose Iran would give  us overflight rights to bomb another Moslem country? Or will our supply lines go across Russia through Turkmenistan? Do we imagine that we have the airlift or  sealift? What effect do we think bombing might have on Afghanistan, a country  that is essentially rubble to begin with? We backed out of Somalia, a Moslem  country, when a couple of GIs got killed and dragged through the streets on  TV. Afghans are not pansies. They whipped the Russians. Our sensitive and  socially-conscious troops would curl up in balls. <br>
<br>
 To win against a more powerful enemy, one forces him to fight a kind of war for which he isn't prepared.  Iraq lost the Gulf War because it fought exactly the kind of war in which  American forces are unbeatable: Hussein played to his weaknesses and our strengths. The Vietnamese did the opposite. They defeated us by fighting a  guerrilla war that didn't give us anything to hit. They understood us. We  didn't understand them. The Moslem world is doing the same thing. Because their  troops, or terrorists as we call them, are not sponsored by a country, we don't  know who to hit. Note that Yasser Arafat, bin Laden, and the Taliban are all denying any part in the destruction of New York. At best, we might, with our creaky intelligence apparatus, find Laden and kill him. It's not worth doing:  Not only would he have defeated America as nobody ever has, but he would then be  a martyr.  <br>
<br>
Face it: The Arabs are smarter than we are. We are militarily weak because we have done what we usually do:  If no enemy is immediately in sight, we cut our forces to the bone, stop most  R&amp;D, and focus chiefly on sensitivity training about homosexuals. When we need a military, we don't have one. Then we are inutterably surprised.<br>
<br>
 The only way we could save any dignity and respect in the world be to hit back so hard as to make teeth rattle around the world. A good approach would be to have NSA fabricate intercepts proving that Libya was responsible, mobilize nationally, invade, and make Libya permanently a US colony.  Most Arab countries are militarily helpless, and that is the only kind our forces  could defeat. Doing this, doing anything other than whimpering, would require that  ancient military virtue known as &quot;balls.&quot; <br>
<br>
 Does Katie Couric have them?<br>

<br>
But this guy is the extreme.  He does make some good points, such that these attacks should have been handled back when they began, not after 5000 deaths.  We have Clinton to thank for that.<br>
<br>
But he's also a maniac. He wants the US to frame another nation just so that we can attack them?!  He thinks we're at war with the Moslem world, we're not.  We're only at war with a VERY VERY VERY small percentage of extreme Moslems.  Framing a nation so we can attack them would make us no better than the terrorists.<br>
<br>
And i wouldn't call the US cowards.  It's difficult to eradicate terrorism, look at all the nations that tries: Britan, Israel, Russia... they haven't succeeded.  Do you think without the WTC attack that the US could have just launched a war with all terrorists?  No, they would have never gained support.  Fvck support you say?  Big words, but you DO need the world's support.  They hide deep in nations, and they're very mobile.  You think destroying some camps is really going to do anything?  No, you need to cut the chicken's head off if you want to accomplish anything.  So the reasons why they didn't take these measures is because they couldn't... but Clinton dropped teh ball too, he should have at least did more than send some cruise missiles at some camps.  <br>
<br>
And i wouldn't call the terrorists brave.  It's like getting in a fight with somebody... you can't take them, so you run off and get somebody else to backstab that person's kids.  I don't consider that brave.<br>

<br>
LOL yeah right.  These terrorists are idiots.  They're childish.  What were their excuses when asked to hand over Bin Laden?  We don't know where he is.  Then oh, we do, but we're not going to hand him over without evidence.  Ok, we'll try him in an Afghani court of law.  Oh, he couldn't have done it, no man can make another man kill himself for a cause. blah blah blah.  If those aren't idiots i don't know who would be.  Yes, they got the first strike, but that's because the US wasn't ready for it.  They have it a bit easier because the US freedom allows them to attack easier.  But in the end, they're just a bunch of idiots running from cave to cave, and sooner or later, they're going to be caught or killed.<br>
<br>
He's sorta right on the US military... but the US doesn't need the Cold War military, they need something more specialized, like a bigger special forces. <br>
<br>
And as for that 'Israel is run by men, we're run by women' attitude, well, that's just sexist.  And how successful is Israel at stopping terrorism?  They get attacked all the time, so obviously they're not too successful.  Blindly attacking when they attack isn't going to solve anything.  <br>
<br>
He's also right on we need to bring fear into terrorists.  Fear so great they wouldn't even dare to attack again.  Terrorists only understand two things, respect, or fear.  Obviously respect would never be gained, so we'll need to use fear.  We need to destroy any GOVERNMENT (not civilians) that support terrorists.  If the ultimatum is you stop, or you will no longer rule your nation is the option, no nations or state will support terrorists again, and without government and the public support, terrorists are nothing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm13.showMessage?topicID=201.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm13.showMessage?topicID=200.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm13.emailToFriend?topicID=197.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm13.threadControl?topicID=197.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=197.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=197.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335frm13>Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
