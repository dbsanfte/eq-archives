Id it just me or are you sick and tired of hearing about Anthrax. I realize it's the news item of today but I think this wide spread coverage is doing more harm than good. Sure people need to be educated about the risks/symptoms but at what point is it enough? I keep seeing the same reports over and over too so it's not like they are reporting something new after 3 weeks of this stuff. <br>
<br>
This reminds me of the Y2K scare and all the folks running around like Chicken Little. Now everytime folks see a powdery substance they'll freak out, 'OH, it's anthrax'. Sure the consequences would be grave but I doubt any terrorist would be able to mount a sizable attack that would effect less than 1% of the population at one time. At this point I choose not to live in fear cause 1)that's what the terrorist want 2)if it's my time to go, it's my time to go. There's just too many things to be paranoid about that it just makes since not to worry about them at all cause if you do you'll be paralyzed and would never leave the house. <br>
<br>
Another thing is we shouldn't be so quick to pin this on Osama's crew cause I'm sure there are enough American sickos out there who saw Sept. 11 as a way to get in under the radar and do things and have everyone assume it's Al'Qaeda. With stuff being mailed to the Senate Majority leader I'm sure the powers in command are seriously contemplating nukes at this time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just my 2cp. This had been bothering me for the last couple of days cause everwhere you turn it's Anthrax this, Anthrax that and I thought the coverage was doing more to generate panic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uyuricrackomatic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yuri Crackomatic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Foot fetish</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/16/01 11:11:22 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.ggi.net/users/dgilbert/eq/yuri-hafring.jpg width=154 height=237></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: And a side of Anthrax please</span><hr size=1> Anthrax really isn't that big a threat.

I know people that don't watch CNN and know NOTHING of what's going on (at least since the florida and new york case)... but i think finding anthrax in a congressman ventilation system as pretty big news.<br>
<br>
And as for the Y2K scare... how do you know it was just a false alarm, or that there really was a problem, but due to all the caution, that it was handled well?  Personally, i'll rather have a false-positive than a false-negative.<br>
<br>
There isn't paranoia yet... CNN did a poll yesterday and more than 80% of those polled said that Anthrax isn't a threat to them personally.<br>
<br>
And who do you think is doing this besides Bin Laden?  Some local militias?  Local militias that have connections in Malaysia to send packages of anthrax over here?  Please, it's obvious who's doing this... maybe some people need to stick their hand in a fire to know it's hot, but basic reasoning is enough for me.<br>

I was just making the point that with all the supposed news being circulated they are giving more of the impression that people are in panic mode. For every confirmed reporting of a Anthrax case there are about 3 false alarms. What I want is good news, not drivethru news that's only concerned about getting the story out and then discover it's a false report or alarm. Case in point, I have a friend who works at the Sears Tower and saw on a news website where the building had been evacuated due to a bomb scare. Spoke with a friend that works there and he said it was false to his knowledge. At this time I guess I just have contempt for the news media cause right before the WTC and Anthrax incidents it was Gary Condit everyday, allday. Just as we all have to be a little bit more responsible for what's goes on around us, we should expect the same from news outlets. It's hard to tell the difference between the National Inquirer and some of the stuff I see on tv. At least the printed editions seem to be more thorough and to the point. <br>
<br>
As you said 80% of the folks are taking the calm approach but when all you hear everyday is about the Anthrax scare it starts folks making more of it than what needs to be. With the Y2K scenario maybe we just did a good job of scaring ourselves where we actually over protected ourselves which is good in that case or this one. Al'Queda seems to relish in going after monuments or people of stature so I'm sure myself or Joe Schmoo working at the convenience store has nothing to worry about atm. <br>
<br>
As Yuri mentioned there are plenty other elements I would rather worry about more. Anthrax by itself isn't the most efficient means of killing people, so it makes me wonder what else is out there. I'm sure the US at this moment is probably prepared for any outbreak of Anthrax but what about smallpox, and other chemical/biological agents. <br>
<br>
Also, I'm sure Al'Qeuda is behind it but folks shouldn't be so quick to push OKC out of our minds to think there isn't other elements that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> could</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be at work here. If I was a deranged individual/organization what better time to wreck havoc than now while everyone is focusing in on Bin Laden. The only info released so far is that the letters to Brokaw and Daschle were done with the same handwriting and mailed from Trenton, NJ. The funny thing is the handwriting is very similar to my own. I was waiting for a handwriting expert to make a profile about the person to see if we shared the same traits. <br>
<br>
Another question is how has this altered your way of life. I know an air alarm siren came on last week and I thought 'Now what?'. Saw for the first time Denver's Biohazard Unit driving down the street. <br>
<br>
Times done changed.<br>

When something did eventually happen, like the shark attacks, they over-exaggerated the seriousness as well (this year was one of the lowest in shark attacks, yet it received so much attention), because the news was slow.  If this stuff didn't happen, what would the news be? 24/7 of Barry Bonds probably.<br>
<br>
Somebody IS watching it if they're playing this this much.  I know on the campus lounge rooms where normally soaps would be playing on the tube in the afternoons, it's non-stop CNN now.  Most of the message boards that i visit there are people watching the news all the time... and as soon as something happens, it seems to be a race to the forums to see who can report it first.  So somebody is watching this stuff.  It's not a conspiracy from some network honchos to brainwash us, but Adam Smith 'unseen hand' driving the market.<br>
<br>
As for domestic elements involved in this... i highly doubt it, it just seems too organized and just too coincidental for it.  According to CNN, the recent stuff are extremely high-grade, so high grade only a few nations have the capability to make that stuff... Iraq and Russia being the most likely.  Is it impossible that it could be domestic elements?  No, there is a possibility, but i highly doubt it (but according to the CNN website poll, 30% believe it is domestic... so that's a pretty significant figure).<br>
<br>
And as for how this has altered my life... it hasn't really, us Canadians don't have as much to fear as you.  The fear of small pox is extremely small, only two locations in the entire world has it, one is in the US, and one is in Russia.  Other bio attacks are possible though... it's hard to say what they can or will do, since the US has never been involved in this type of conflict before.  I'm not too familiar with the attacks the Israelis have had to put up with, but i've never heard of them getting anthrax or other biological attacks.<br>
<br>
People aren't panicking yet... and i don't think they will unless something really serious happens.  Nothing but this is on the news because this is what everybody is interested in.  Seems like everywhere i turn and look, whether it is talking to my hair stylist yesterday while i got my haircut, or visiting a gaming msg board like this, people are talking about it.  'Geez, you hear about the baby that got anthrax?' or 'Do you think this can get anymore serious?  You think they're going to try spreading this anthrax through a cropduster?'... it's what people are talking about these days.  The media is only feeding what people want.<br>
<br>
This is serious stuff... i would definitely rather watch the newest anthrax case, or an investigation of these anthrax attacks, than news of Barry Bonds or Gary Condit.  What do you think is more news worthy than this?<br>

<br>
It's definitely a news worthy story. I guess it tends to get too sensationalized cause they have everyone worked up about Anthrax. I think folks have more a chance getting ran over in traffic than being targetted. The media should ask themselves why they are being targetted in the first place. Could be the terrorist realize this is a pretty effective means of scaring folks even further. <br>

<br>
It's probably going to spook people... but can you get into any legal trouble?  You didn't officially claim it was a terrorist attack or anything.  Is there anything wrong with putting on a gasmask?  And you're pouring harmless water/alcohol on the ground.<br>
