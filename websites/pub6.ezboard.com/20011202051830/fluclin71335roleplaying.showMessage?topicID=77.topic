It was far from the lavishness of the esteemed 3rd Gate.<br>
<br>
Alleys were rank from the fecal waste that flowed through their centers until they met culverts to the river below, eventually flushing out to the Ocean of Tears.<br>
<br>
Neriak was a dangerous place, despite the guards that patrolled most of it.  But, once one left the common areas of the Foreign Quarters, and took the ramps that lead to the housing districts, it became something entirely worse.<br>
<br>
City guards did not patrol this place, Nobles did not come here to slum.  It was the home to Ogres and Trolls, and the odd Human or Erudite.<br>
<br>
What passed for security in this wretched cave?  Troll mercenaries, Ogre gangsters.  Their hands eagerly extended to accept bribes, or lay a beating upon you that would end your life.<br>
<br>
Justice was bought and sold here as easily as brothel slaves.  One could acquire anything one wanted here.  The blind eyes of the City Officials, combined with the bought arms of justice made this a smugglers paradise.<br>
<br>
Assassins, smugglers, cutthroats, slave traders, murderers, thieves, fugitives, and mercenaries inhabited this place.  Rough hewn buildings in seeming decay opened up to reveal lavishly appointed and comfortably furnished rooms and apartments.  Smuggling, slave trading, assassination and general skullduggery were profitable if one was competent and knew his place.<br>
<br>
Without question this place had its Lord.  Varger, an Erudian Knight, had his hand deep into the pockets of just about every illicit trade that operated here.  He used well his diplomatic immunity as Ambassador from Paineel.  He also used well his heavy coin purse, and knew exactly who to pay to keep this part of town exactly the way it was.<br>
<br>
Varger prevented open crime with a vengeance.  One had to operate in stealth to survive here, or one was readily dispatched.<br>
<br>
Varger kept the Foreign Quarter quiet, and off of the Itineraries  of Neriak’s Council.  Varger made sure the guards were of his choosing.  Varger made sure everyone kept their place.  Varger decided who could operate in what territories and who could move in and take those territories away.<br>
<br>
If you wanted to wage war against a competing thieves guild, you asked Varger.  If you wanted to assassinate a citizen of Neriak, you checked with Varger.<br>
<br>
Nothing was done without Varger’s consent, unless you had a death wish.<br>
<br>
Varger liked to make examples of his enemies.  He liked to raise them as skeletal servants and parade them quietly down the streets of the Quarter.<br>
<br>
Nobody crossed Varger and lived.  Nobody had done so in the ten years since he took control.  Likely nobody would do so while he lived.  He was perhaps the one resident of this place that would die of old age.<br>
<br>
To Mantros, Varger was a God.<br>
<br>
Varger never spoke.  Or at least, none had reported hearing him do so.  Only his closest advisors knew for sure.  Varger did not need to speak.  His eyes told you all you needed to know.<br>
<br>
Mantros had come to the Quarter because he simply had nowhere else to go.<br>
<br>
Selling the silver buckles from his clothing, he managed to afford a room in the Quarter.<br>
<br>
It was not long before his money ran out, and his luck with it.<br>
<br>
He was tossed out, literally, into the alley… and with a splash in the septic waters he landed.  Brown and smelly water sprayed about and coated him in filth.  Unfortunately for the Troll Landlord, it also coated Varger as he roamed past unheard.<br>
<br>
As Varger turned to end the Troll’s life, Mantros fled.  He did not get far when darkness engulfed him and he could barely walk, and barely see.<br>
<br>
Skeletal fingers grab his arms and lifted him.  He was carried before Varger.<br>
<br>
Varger looked directly into the eyes of Mantros.<br>
<br>
Mantros looked into the eyes of death.<br>

He felt the rough wood beneath him, and pressing against his arms and the soles of his feet.  His hands roamed the confines of the wooden box and soon he determined he was in a coffin.  The lid was locked from the outside.<br>
<br>
That he was aboard ship was certain.  He could feel the gentle sway of a barque navigating calmer waters.<br>
<br>
What did Varger plan for him… the last thing he remembered was being stretched before him, his limbs held be skeletal servants, as Varger weaved a spell and put him into a death like sleep.<br>
<br>
His fingers roamed about the interior of his confine, seeking a flaw in the wood to work away at. Finding none, he begin to pound at the lid.  Using only mild strength at first to see if he would draw attention, then growing bolder, and hitting harder.<br>
<br>
The lid would not budge.<br>
<br>
It was humid, sticky and hot.  And after many hours, Mantros passed out exhausted.  He awoke some time later coughing.  His small prison had filled with smoke, and he could hear the clash of metal nearby.  Unknown to him, the Captain and Crew had been boarded by pirates, and the ship now foundered, burning and slowly sinking, as the crew fought for their lives.<br>
<br>
The smoke was all the information Mantros needed however.  He would escape now or die.  Pounding his fists bloody at the lid, it finally began to give, and eventually the hinges popped free of the wood, and Mantros exploded forth from the coffin and dived sideways to assess his situation.<br>
<br>
Peeking over the top of a crate, he took in the scene.  He was in the belly of a ship, and 3 cutthroats had cornered an officer.  The man fought with skill but would soon be overcome.  Mantros turned and caught a glimpse of sunlight, and the stairs to the deck.  Without hesitation he ran through the smoky interior and rushed up the stairs.<br>
<br>
The two vessels were locked together with grapple and rope.  The cutthroats busy, working rapidly to sever the ties that bound them to the burning ship.  Nearby he could see land.  Forest and beach barely visible in the bright daylight.  He gathered breath and jumped over the railing, head first into the sea below.<br>
<br>
Head first into the mast that had burned away, and now lay smoking in the water beside the ship.  In his haste, he had been careless, and pain blinded him as his eye was torn from his socket, spilling red into the waters.<br>
<br>
He lay floating on his back, face covered in blood, his head reeling from the blow, and barely conscious.<br>
<br>
As his mind cleared, he tore at his shirt and covered the wound with a makeshift bandage.  The pain from the salt water entering the wound was unbearable.   His hand tight over his eye socket, he swam, and kicked his way to shore.<br>
