And I think to myself, &quot;Oh hell, this is gonna be a long night...&quot;  But 5:30 or so rolls around and I start taking roll call... and lo and behold we've a TON of tanks coming to kick the dragons butt... now if only we had a caster or two...<br>
<br>
In the end we had 2 Wizards and a Necro as our sum total of casters... the Necro was needed for DMF, and the wizards were levels 51 and 52, with Ice Comet, and thus stood a good chance of landing some really nice damage against Naggy.  So I figured we'd be fine and made the groups.<br>
<br>
A couple people had to be turned away at the end, but we had 8 full groups and not enough stragglers to make another... and sending someone in against a dragon alone seems kind of un-fair.<br>
<br>
As I'm forming groups I got a tell from Utrie, a level 59 cleric from Ashborne asking what we're planning on doing with Ragefire afterwards.  She offered to help  in exchange for the camp (since we weren't going to be taking it after).  She actually brought in two characters, Utrie and Dezz (a level 58? Enchanter), and also brought in a full combat team from Ashborne who I ended up letting slaughter pretty much all the FG's for us.<br>
<br>
I'd like to apologize to Aere and Danaldil - normally I do have CoG teams pull and we kill the FG's ourself, but I was tired when the raid started and wanted it to end as soon as possible... and having Ashborne kill the FG's for us was the quick and easy way out.  We also had a complete lack of 'chanters and only one bard who might've had a chance at charming the giants... so we'd most likely be fighting them in multiples.  The first room, especially, is a fight against 3 at once, one of them a wizard... and I didn't want to take the time to stop the raid and rez the number of casualties that would most likely have resulted.<br>
<br>
So Ashborne went forward and contintued so obliterate the giants in front of us, and we continued to move forward in a somewhat orderly, if rambunctious fashion.  After dispatching the giants in and around the throne room, we began to move across the drawbridge and further towards the lair.<br>
<br>
I'd like to take some time to talk about raid discipline now...<br>
<br>
When I say things in /shout, I mean them.  I'm not just kidding around or trying to go on a power trip and not let anyone else play with the toys in the area.  I don't shout things that aren't important.  I don't shout things that I'd like people to &quot;strongly consider&quot; but are ultimately up to your own judgement.  I expect people to follow the orders contained in my shouts, and find it very unpleasant and annoying when they don't.<br>
<br>
I know that Nagafens lair is not exactly the most dangerous place around... but please consider this:  If you fail to follow the orders given by a raid leader in an easy zone, you are likely do do the same in a place like the Plane of Fear or Hate where not following a single order can get EVERYONE ON THE RAID KILLED.  I'm not kidding.  I've seen 60 people die because one person was standing 10 feet outside where the raid leader told people not to go, or because one person sat down when they were told not to.<br>
<br>
In short, if you are not going to listen to me (or any other raid leader) on a raid, regardless of where, please, for the good of everyone, stay the hell away from all of our raids.<br>
<br>
I don't know how many people clicked on the god-damned bridge as we were going across... but I coulda sworn I shouted, multiple times, that NO ONE BUT ME should click on ANYTHING in the area.<br>
<br>
Is that not clear?  Do I need to use smaller words?  Was I speaking Elder Dragon instead of Common?  When I say don't click on anything, I mean DON'T *(&amp;#@&amp; CLICK ON ANYTHING.  At all.  Not even once.  I don't care how curious you are, DON'T DO IT.<br>
<br>
If you wanna play with stuff in the zone, wait until the raid is over, then knock yerself out.  But while the raid is in progress, and I'm still leading, follow my orders or don't come in the first place.<br>
<br>
I saw a number of people take lava baths because the bridge went up as they were crossing it.  I myself got dumped in the lava as I was crossing.  This annoys me greatly.<br>
<br>
Also, at multiple times during the raids I got tells asking me why I was doing something, and shouldn't I be doing it this way instead, and no don't do that... most of these coming from first time raiders...  Ok, I understand the need to voice your opinion... but please, trust me.  I've run at least 4 Naggy raids to date and I've never failed.  I don't intend to, either.  I think I know what I'm doing by now.  Trust the raid leader to know how to run a raid and also, understand that we don't have time to give a detailed explanation for everything we do all the time.  Sometimes you have to go on faith.<br>
<br>
Again, if you are not willing to trust a raid leaders judgement and follow their orders... don't go on their raid... run your own damn raid instead.<br>
<br>
I do not run these raids because I get paid to do so, or because I'm required to by my guild or by the KCoG.  I run them because I like running them.  When I stop having fun doing it, I will stop running them.  Kellory is the same way... he runs plane raids for us because he likes doing it, and because he likes to share the experience with people who normally wouldn't be able to go and do these things without having to join a larger guild.<br>
&lt;/soapbox&gt;<br>
<br>
Ok... now on with the show...<br>
<br>
After pulling and dispatching the lair spawns (thanks to Danaldil and Aere here... Aere sacrificed himself for the team and died during the pull), we started setting up the buff line.  This took a little while... while I was setting it up a lot of people were giving me tells about a lot of random crap, and suggestions about what buffs should be used in what order, and that kind of thing.  Folks... we killed Nagafen with 4 total deaths.  I think I know what I was doing... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Salani, a level 59 (?) Shaman and Dezz helped out by providing some high levels buffs for us.  Again thanks to Asheborne for the help they gave, and good luck to Utrie on a quick RF spawn and completing her epic!<br>
<br>
After buffing we gathered in the chat-room and went over the strategy.  People seemed to get this pretty well... there was the usual spam and chatter in the chat-room, but I think I've ranted enough about discipline already.  It is in your best interest for everyone else on the raid to hear what the raid leader(s) have to say... so when they're talkin, don't say nothin.  'nuff said.<br>
<br>
We logged back in and formed up our original groups.  A few groups had missing clerics (we lost 2 during the raid... one had to leave early because of school, and I dunno if we ever found out what was up with Sybok... heh).  But we obviously had enough healers to get the job done, so everything went ok.<br>
<br>
We charged in and started whacking at Naggy... I didn't see the first wave of Heal-me shouts until he was at about 75% life...  I went back to heal when he was at about 60% myself... and when I came back he had already dropped to the end of &quot;Lord&quot; in &quot;Lord Nagafen&quot;... meaning he was at about 30% life left... so I called for the nukers then... and I don't know if any of you actually had time to land a spell before he started running and died or not... heh.<br>
<br>
Kudos to my group of Aere, Lenenae, Performer, Danaldil, and Fenryll for getting the experience from the kill (I know I'm in a hell level... but my bar didn't even move... not even one pixel... sheesh... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Anyone catch who got the killing blow?  I missed it...<br>
<br>
Items were lotto'd off as soon as the (extrememly brief) CR and res'ing were complete.  There were a few mis-understandings that went on in here, but everything seemed to turn out ok in the end.  As I said, the Jacinth Naggy was kind enough to give us will be lotto'd off in an upcoming event...<br>
<br>
We've had enough surplus from raids since Kellory and I started leading them to throw a decent party for everyone who's participated on raids in recent months.  I'm planning on getting together with a few folks and planning a lake-side BBQ in West Commons or something... we'll have a scavenger hunt and some other games for prizes (like Velium Jacinth jewelry), as well as a lot of booze. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When we finally get around to planning this, there will be a post in the Events section of this board with details.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for coming everyone.  Hopefully I'll see a lot of familiar faces when we go up against Vox next... we sure owe her a good thumping. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.
