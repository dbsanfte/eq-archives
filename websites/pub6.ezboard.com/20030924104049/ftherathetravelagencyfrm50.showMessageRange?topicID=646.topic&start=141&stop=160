<br>
Your basis for deciding good and bad rotations is way off base.  The more people you have interested in content the more you *need* rotations.  Severillous, before he was on rotation, was seen by a small handful of guilds – guilds that were capable of moving in with 1-2 groups, killing him, and even if they didn’t need the scale or haste items, they can sell them for 60k+ plat each (not counting rare spells like Torpor or Sunstrike).  20 minutes of work, and your guild is doing well for peridots and pearls for a few weeks.  <br>

<br>
What is so inherently bad is that if you take Severillous off rotation, no guild that is currently on rotation would ever see him again.  You’d have smaller groups of the big guilds park a toon with sense summoned in the zone and pop him every time they saw him up.  Please see the hundreds of Lodizal kills for an idea of what FFA mobs look like, and keep in mind, Lodi shields don’t sell for anywhere near what a CoF or Green scale or Torpor do.<br>

<br>
No, other guilds would never see the mob.  We’re not talking about a guild of 20-30 people mobilizing quickly, we are talking about xp groups of L 65s that would make Sev regret having spawned, and the guilds that were once on rotation regret having taken him off.  There would be no “moving on”, and it wouldn’t be some misperceived threat by the “big guilds” doing this as policy.  It would be small groups figuring out how to best spend their plat on their new frog twinks, at the expense of the guilds that actually find CoFs and Warrior epics useful.<br>

I don’t think you do, but welcome to the larger guild’s end of the RTA compromise.  For every rotation you find a “hindrance”, think, really think, about just how many mobs BOTS or Tindi or NB has held back on not killing that they easily could have if this server were 100% FCFS.<br>

<br>
No, it’s not a plot or a tactic.  You have some very grave misconceptions of what your new “guild capabilities” would be, if suddenly you had uncontested access to Sev and Trak, that all of a sudden you’d jump right on King Tormax, Lord Yelinak, or Avatar of War rotations. . .rotations that BOTS has had on autopass for more than 6 months.  So no, the Sev rotation and Trak rotation are not what keep BOTS or Tindi, or LoM from having competition.  The Sev and Trak rotations make sure that the guilds who are interested in AND capable of killing them, can do so much more often than if they weren’t on rotation.  Once every 3 months is certainly better than never.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My main contestation with Rotations , is A) How many guilds exist on a few of them ... Again see my point above ...

<br>
There is no “getting it out of your system”, guilds leave rotations when the loot gained from an encounter is no longer useful for the time invested.  Guilds that are on rotations, usually, have more members, and thus have more people who want and can use the gear from the mobs they do.  If Item X is good for all your healers, does it not stand to reason that all your healers might want it?  If one Item X drops every two slayings on average, and you have Y healers, you will have to kill Mob A 2Y times, in order to get everyone taken care of (assuming no turnover).  Again, the more people that want said content, the greater the need for a rotation to share it.<br>

<br>
So its ok for you to look after your own interests, but anyone else who does so is being unfair?  As for losing people to bigger guilds, welcome to being a guild leader.  We all lose people, and its no easier for BOTS to get good quality people who won’t get burned out raiding 7 nights a week as it is for you to get 40 good, quality players L 46+.  As for your focus on planar reservations: The only use for Hate/Fear/Sky is for epic items, the armor in Kael arena or PoG is much more powerful than PoH/PoF armor, and can be farmed by 1-2 groups of L 55+.  Additionally, there are so few dates during the week that are reserved, that you should have no trouble getting to the planes if you felt so inclined.  However, I don’t see why you keep bringing up planar reservations in a discussion about PoP flag mobs.  Planar reservations have nothing to do with rotations and nothing to do with PoP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This is why the Rules and laws that we all go by must be looked at from time to time ...

<br>
Right, so while hiding behind a technicality of the written rules, you ignore the spirit that went into their creation:  That we share content amongst those able to kill said content. . .on their own.  Putting AD on rotation just hurts those middle and up-and-coming guilds who would benefit from repeated tries, all because the guilds that don’t stand a chance against him on their own, insist on taking advantage of this technicality.<br>

So, by using your example, IF your guild wanted to kill Trakanon 40 times and could get to it first all 40 times, then it is ok for all the other guilds to not have access to Trakanon for 120 days.  Followed by another guild that wants to do the same thing.  So, if you are in a 5th guild, you may have to wait 4 * 120 = 480 days (a year and a half) before you can see Trakanon.  But... that's ok because you got yours.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But I see it as more of a bottleneck , and hinderance ... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, it is a hinderance to your guild to have to share.  But using your example, you shifted the hinderance from your guild to being the hinderance for all others.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So yes there does come a point in time when rotations become a bad thing .... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Why is this surprising?  The longer the game goes, the more people who will be able to do stuff.  It is simple common sense.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My main contestation with Rotations , is A) How many guilds exist on a few of them ... Again see my point above ...

<br>
Your main concern is self-centered.  As long as you get yours, screw the rest.  &quot;Several kills in a row&quot; is not how it usually works.  My guild killed Trakanon around 50 times to equip our members before we &quot;got it out of our system&quot;.  What you suggest is FCFS which will revert to racing and all of the issues we had to face before.  Meanwhile, while YOU are getting your 50 Trakanons, all the other guilds must wait 1/2 a year for you to &quot;get it out of your system&quot;, during which time they see zero Trakanons.  Why should you keep them out that long when they are able to do the content?<br>
<br>
[a bunch of stuff about the number for PoFear/PoHate access]<br>
<br>
a) On an off day, go to the planes all you want.  All that number is for is to *reserve* a date.  As I understand it (haven't checked in a long time), PoFear and PoHate are reserved less than once or twice a week.  There is *nothing* that keeps you out during that time.<br>
<br>
b) It has already been mentioned that there probably isn't going to be much resistance to changing that value.  All it takes is for someone who is concerned about it to get off their ass and do something about it.  Call a meeting and such (probably wouldn't last 15 minutes) to get the number changed down to 18 or something.  Constantly coming to the board and bitching about it does not get it changed.<br>
<br>
As far as other rotations go, there is no limit on the folks you take.  If you can kill the AoW with your guild, which consists of 20 people, then you can get on the rotation.  If it takes you 100, then you can still get a rotation slot.<br>

The brick wall = their ass stuck to a couch.  I've already stated (as have others) that you won't get it done on this board with 100 people saying different things.

The only way you can say his loot isn't desireable is if you are in a VT or post-VT guild, because you would then have the equivalent or slightly better.  You really need to do some research on what he drops, and then notice its better than anything your guild has.  The only reason teaming guilds won't farm him is twofold - 1) loot arguments would ensue), and 2) there would then be multiple entities wanting to kill him whenever he was up, increasing the chance of losing the one technicality holding this sugar daddy together.<br>

Sandalorn, you've watched too many X-Files episodes.  VoF and LoM and SotE all got into HoH on their own, because the mobs in question were alive for them to try.  Keeping them perma-killed would have been both easy, and indicative of the very conspiracy you seem to crave so badly.  No one made a huge stink when LoM and SotE and VoF got into HoH, despite those &quot;newbs&quot; infringing on &quot;our zone&quot;.  Why?  I mean really, why?  Because you're onto us, we're all about keeping as many people as possible out of our zones, so why didn't anyone raise an eyebrow or take steps to prevent this disaster from happening?  I'll tell you why, because those three guilds got in on a level playing field and on their own merits.  No, they didn't &quot;do it just like we did&quot; nor &quot;in the same linear order&quot;.  But they didn't grab a bunch of buddies to team up on a mob they couldn't take on their own, and thus no one felt like fair play was violated.  They're still in &quot;our zone&quot; and eating up all &quot;our xp and phat cash loots&quot;, but no one griped because no one feels like they cheated the system. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>

WTF??  Did you even read my post.  I didn't say people have done it or would do it - I stated (for this exact same reason) why the threat of doing this is so absurd.  But it is continously brought up in alot of threads by higher tier guilds. You slam me when you are the ones implying that you would do this type of thing.  That was a wierd statement Karadin.  I am going to assume you just mis-read what I was saying.  Either that or you twisted it just enough to get some shots at me. Fair enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;But they didn't grab a bunch of buddies to team up on a mob they couldn't take on their own, and thus no one felt like fair play was violated. &quot;<br>
<br>
I am having a hard time even coming up with a response to this.  Fair Play????  As defined by who?  YOU???  So now we smaller guilds not only have to abide by SoE's rules, RTA Rules (that you made), but we also have to make sure we don't break the imaginary Karadin-made &quot;Fair Play&quot; policy.  But I don't really want to get into this again with you Karadin.  This is where we differ about as much as two humans can.  You believe that because you have defeated a mob - You get to set the rules and policies about how all other guilds kill that said mob.  I completely disagree.  <br>
<br>
Rotations work when the benefit a majority of guilds over a minority.  That is why Rots like Sev and Trak are becoming obselete, because they now have more Guilds on the rotation then Guilds wanting to get on the rotation.  I bet most guilds on those rotations would want them to go back to FFA.  I think they probably believe in the time it takes for their turn to come up on those rotations, that they could probably get 2-3 FFA kills in.  But any decision made on these two rotations should only be made by those guilds currently killing him - Guilds that have passed on to higher content who no longer kill these mobs should have NO say in what happens to these decisions.  It does not affect them.  So the majority are the guilds on the Rotation, thus no benefit.<br>
<br>
Rotations like Cursed, AoW, etc are still working because the guilds on those rotations do not outnumber the guilds that either just got on the rotation or are still trying to get on the rotation.  Thus it benefits more guilds than not.<br>
<br>
Flagged mob rotations don't benefit anyone except those that have already got their flags. (And right now - That is a Minority)  Now..If the case was that AD, Behemoth, Grummus were getting permakilled by guilds that have already kill them and thus denying other guilds the opportunity to kill them, then yes..a rotation would be warranted.  But we know that is not the case - Maybe it will be a case in the future, but then the decision on whether to make them a rotation mob should be only between those guilds that are still killing them (and really those guilds that are still trying to do or will so in the near future).  BotS, Tindi, NB, etc should have no say in what happens to those mobs because you are no longer currently killing them.  So why would you have a right to decide when you aren't even interested in killing them?  Just because you kill them first??<br>
<br>
Why don't you let the guilds that are still killing these mobs (or wil be trying to) decide whether they should go on rotation or not?  <br>
<br>
That sounds much more fair to me than policy being dictated by guilds who already have killed them and have progressed pass them so much that they don't plan on killing them again.<br>

They are important because Sev is the only reasonable source of green scales (war epic) and Trak is the only source for VP keys.  This is not new, this point has been made very clearly from alot of the higher end guilds, who by the way would be the ones to benefit the most from a free for all trak/sev.  This is an example where an RTA policy (made by high end guilds) sacrifices there capacity to consume content for the greater good.  <br>
<br>
It would not be the end of the world if these mobs were off rotations since they dont stop people from progressing further in the game, but its still desirable content, so needs to be kept on a rotation (in my opinion).<br>

How much rarer would a mob that spawns every 5 days and has much more valuable loot be?  Sev is only slightly more difficult than Lodi, so you would have groups of several people ganking him as soon as he spawns then timing his return.  Can you honestly convince yourself that you would be able to mobilize your guild faster than 4 people from one of the big guilds?  Or for that matter, would you be able to mobilize your guild faster than 12 members of my guild or SoY or VoLS or one of the other half dozen mid-sized guilds?  We could certainly use more green scales for our warriors.  Do you really want to have to race people to this mob?<br>

<br>
I fail to see how anyone could see teaming up on a mob as cheating the system.  People keep refering to rotations.  All rotations are for is to simply share a mob.  The entity joining the rotation states who they are and for all other rotation mobs the entity must remain the same.  This has nothing to do with any other types of encounters in the game.<br>
<br>
Who cares if two, three, or five rotation guilds join forces to kill Talendor.  Or team up for Vindi, or HoT.  No one cares, but god forbid if they team up to take on AD.  In my previous guild, we had 3 guilds help us to take down Ragefire for our first cleric epic, is this frowned apon?  I've seen plenty of guilds team up to do the Royals down in Chardok, is this frowned apon?<br>
<br>
Again, I fail to see what the problem is that a couple guilds teamed up to take down a non rotation mob.  I don't think this issue is about teaming up at all.

<br>
And this is exactly why your statement is a contradiction.  Lots of guilds wanting to be on a rotation = highly contested.  Do some simple math, using your statement:  <br>
1.  Most guilds want them to go back to FFA.<br>
2.  Most guilds believe that they could get 2-3 FFA kills in before their rotation comes up.<br>
<br>
Simple math shows this as an impossibility.  Supposed 1/2X + 1 of the guilds (which is a simple majority where X is the total number of guilds - thus your most simple 'most') want the rotations to go FFA on those two mobs.  If this same 'most' believe that they can get even 2 FFA kills during the same duration that they could get 1 kill under rotation, that would mean that the mob would have spawned 2 times more than it could have by the mechanics of the game (1/2X + 1) * 2 = X + 2.  Added to that, even if half the guilds could get in twice the number of kills, that means that the other half of the guilds on rotation would get none (zero).  I guess that is ok though to you - might makes right in your opinion, clearly stated by your post.  This is exactly what you accuse the higher tier guilds of and as being such a terrible crime.  You also are most likely incorrect in assuming that your guild would be one of the ones that actually could kill the mob more times during what was once the rotational period (oops, didn't think about that did you?)<br>

Have you been reading anything anyone else has posted?  Do you *still* not realize that AD drops very near VT quality items?  There are NO mobs in PoP that drop only flags.

<br>
And this is also where you confuse the issue.  You are pretty much right, BotS cares little of these mobs and/or who kills them.  However, we do care greatly about the precedent that certain actions set.  Once you do encounter-X by Y technique, what is preventing someone from using the same argument for using Y technique on encounter-X+1?  Pretty soon using that logic, you'll be reaching up to mobs that we *do* care about.  That is why we discuss these issues.<br>

I fear you would be very sadly surprised then.  One group of 65s can kill Severilous.  Before PoP, we killed Trakanon with 9 people *after* the manaburn nerf.  If Severilous or Trakanon spawned at 5am in the morning it would be dead before 5:05am by a single, or at most double group raid.<br>

<br>
Or you could be like any one of the other servers and *really* have your play dictated to you by a very small set of guilds.  I urge you to visit other guild sites and see the things that have happened in the past.  I remember a FoH incident where FoH was going for Trakanon and another guild was down there.  The smaller guild threatened to petition and Furor asked them to please do it.  Since he had very deep connections into Verant (before it was SoE), he would simply have them all banned if they didn't move out of the way or at least make their game play on their server to be a living hell since no one would interfere with his guild.  Of course, he used quite more colorful language.  On the Rathe, you pay your money and get guaranteed by the whole playerbase that if you can kill a mob, you will have the right to continue killing that mob for as long as you want, maybe not as often as you want, but you *will* get a shot at it occassionally.  If you cannot understand this aspect of the rotations, then I suggest that your vision is clouded by greed, and so badly clouded that you see yourself as an undeniable force in the FCFS scheme of play (a 'fact' that is surely unfounded). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karadin>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM<BR>

Yes.  Twice.  Your assertion is that this whole thing is about keeping other guilds out of “our zones”.  I merely pointed out that you’re wrong, it’s not “just about keeping other guilds out”, and offered three examples of guilds that got in and not one word of it came up here.  No one is threatening to permakill anything, they are *showing you* that if their aim was to keep people out, they would have done so, but, and here is the tough part to understand, they haven’t.  Thus, your “voila” proof that this is all about keeping the “newbs” out is wrong.  It’s about playing on an even playing field, and alliances are ok, but they have to be all or nothing, not pick and choose at whim.  I’m not twisting anything you’re saying, I’m saying that what you’re saying is not accurate.<br>

But I don't really want to get into this again with you Karadin. This is where we differ about as much as two humans can.

So you’ve asked every player L 1 – 65 for their input into their thoughts on all the rotations your guild is on, and what their ideas are on PoP mobs and teaming, right?  No, obviously you haven’t, nor should you.  I don’t make a single comment about the Shei rotation, as my guild has never killed him.  I have no right to comment on the special rules that govern it, and I won’t listen to someone who hasn’t killed Emperor tell me or the guilds on the rotation how we should change it.  I don’t believe because I have defeated a mob that I get to set rules and policies on HOW other guilds kill that said mob.  If you wanna use a ranger or bard for MT, or wanna use a cleric nuking rotation, go for it, I don’t care.  What I do believe is that because we entered into the RTA rotations with the understanding that each side gives and takes (small guilds and large), that if those smaller guilds are going to change their portion of that compromise, then it makes no sense for the larger guilds to continue to make theirs.  If you need an alliance to beat your top end content, then do so, but be an alliance for all rotations, or don’t kill your falsely inflated top end content.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Rotations work when the benefit a majority of guilds over a minority.

I think they probably believe in the time it takes for their turn to come up on those rotations, that they could probably get 2-3 FFA kills in. But any decision made on these two rotations should only be made by those guilds currently killing him - Guilds that have passed on to higher content who no longer kill these mobs should have NO say in what happens to these decisions.

The only rotations that have become obsolete are THO and Burrower, because no one took the time to kill him.  Tunare is getting there, because no one wants to clear PoG.  Any rotation with 20+ guilds on it however, has never been more relevant in its lifetime.  Any guild that thinks they would get “2-3” FFA kills is fooling itself.  If either of those mobs went off rotation, all that would happen is no guild currently on rotation would ever see him again, but the upside is they could buy said green scales or CoF or Torpor in the bazaar from the xp groups of the larger guilds who would take it upon themselves to kill Sev at every opportunity to equip their twinks.  Please notice, Talendor and Gorenaire are never up.  Ever.  I’m not talking about a threat from the GL of BOTS or NB or Tindi, I’m talking about the same people that made the Manaburn Syndicate tick.  A simple xp group porting in, whacking a 32k hp dragon and looting him, before the 25 – 30 members of the former rotation guild had even finished porting.  The more people interested in one mob, the more a rotation is needed, not less.<br>

I’d make the same slam against you that you’ve made against me, namely, Who are you to tell me I have no say in who kills a mob, especially one I *have* actually killed.  However, you will notice NB is not, nor has ever been, on the Sev rotation, and are still very active on the Trak rotation, since we are the one guild that still actively goes to VP.  I don’t make any comments on what changes people want to make to the special rotation rules for Sev, save the warning about what *would* happen if the rotation stopped.  If you can’t see what a KS fest the removal of the Sev rotation would become, please do a Find and Replace on the Flame Central with “Lodi” and “Sev”.  Sev’s loot is worth 3-4 times what Lodi’s is, and Lodi has more hp.  You do the math.<br>

But we know that is not the case - Maybe it will be a case in the future, but then the decision on whether to make them a rotation mob should be only between those guilds that are still killing them (and really those guilds that are still trying to do or will so in the near future). BotS, Tindi, NB, etc should have no say in what happens to those mobs because you are no longer currently killing them.

<br>
No, they only have no benefit for the guilds that have killed him already because the guilds that can kill Aerin Dar easily are VT-capable guilds (BOTS, NB, Tindi).  Those guilds that can kill him, but just barely, do find his items useful, but it’s too close of a fight and takes too long to form up for, to risk killing him on a regular basis.  Then you have the guilds that team him, whose items are in no way comparable to his drops, but can’t beat on their own.  Please, if all he is about is flags, tell me that CB and VOLS destroyed whatever two items dropped.  I would offer that not only did they not destroy them, but those are now amongst, if not the, premiere items in their respective guilds.  As for why we should have a say?  We have comments to make because the server conventions of how we function are being undermined, it’s the principle of the thing.  And if you think NB is done with Aerin Dar, could you please tell my two members and our four recent applicants who don’t have the flags that?  I would also point out, we have killed Aerin Dar no less than seven times.  Our next time will be our eighth kill.  “Guilds will only kill him 2-3 times and move on”  I guess not.<br>

For those of you who keep thinking that Aerin Dar loot is “inconsequential” or worse “non-existent”.  Vengeance 1 ring, weapons that exceed epic and primal ratios and stats, Improved Damage IV necklace. . .Things the guilds teaming Aerin Dar have in spades, right?  Just because VT guilds or elemental planes guilds have better and consider this “bleh”, doesn’t mean its garbage.<br>

a) prove an existing rule is inadequate<br>
b) prove an existing rule is flawed<br>
c) prove an existing rule is unneeded<br>
d) show that a new rule is needed<br>

b) give alternatives of a more &quot;correct&quot; way<br>
c) give evidence/examples of how these are really better/correct<br>
d) gather support<br>
<br>
<br>
So far, your arguments have been:<br>
<br>
1) I don't like rotations because they make me wait<br>
2) I think my guild can gather and kill the mob faster than other guilds so we should get the lion's share<br>
3) I don't like to share with others<br>
4) Therefore, the mobs should be FFA<br>
<br>
This is the same exact discussions we had with Qwai, and to some extent Shei, years ago.  No one was persuaded then.  No one is persuaded now.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to listen as to why AD is &quot;different&quot; and therefore deserves different rules but no one has given any *new* reason to the effect.<br>
<br>
Case in point:  Emperor controls access to VT.  Emperor (in effect) drops 40 keys each time you kill it (granted, it isn't 72 but it is still a lot).  Emperor also drops loot considered to be pretty darn good.  Emperor is on rotation.<br>
<br>
By your argument, there is no reason not to team up on Emperor either.  Well, Trakanon is the same, but only drops 4 keys at a time.  No reason to not allow team-ups on him either.  Well, the same goes for Grummus, Behemoth, Bertoxx, Saryrn, Rallos Zek the Warlord, Solusek Ro, Fennin Ro, Xegony, Coirnav, EarthB guy, Caprin, Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek, etc.  Why not allow teaming on them too?  Hell, might as well allow teaming on everything and throw the rotations out the window.  THAT is the N+1 precedence problem that we do not agree with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dytren>Dytren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>SL - Guild Rep</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/8/03 9:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=155>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Dytren,<br>

Everyone has gotten away from the original issue and reason this thread was established.  The simple facts (I'm not god, this is just my perception) are that VoLS/CB teamed to kill AD who drops flags for HoH and other items that may or may not warrant AD being on rotation.  AD is not on rotation at this time and there were not rules (traditions ok, but not rules) governing the killing of flag mobs.  If I'm reading correctly, they had asked prior to killing AD if this was an acceptable method of doing so and were told yes.  This being the case, I say Congratulations VoLS/CB for doing a great job.  Killing AD without primals or zerging is an accomplishment and should be recognized as such.  Their planning and strategy speaks highly of the players involved.  /tips hat to VoLS/CB<br>
<br>
The second issue that arose was the concern that guilds (seeing AD killed by a team) would begin to disregard the rotation rules on rotational mobs.  This COULD happen, yes, but it could happen at any time with or without this precedent and such a scenario seems less likely to be caused by this approach to a non-rotational mob.  The fact is that VoLS/CB follow (or appear to given their reputation) established rotational rules on rotational mobs.  I would be willing to bet that had they known that such an issue would arise from their actions, they would not have killed AD in this manner in the first place.  However, what's done is done and all we can do as a community is decide whether or not to allow teaming on flag mobs in the future.  A possible solution (since we haven't seen many of those) would be to disallow teaming on flag mobs the first time that a guild/alliance kills it.  Should they decide to kill as a team on their first attempt, they establish themselves as an alliance with respect to future rotational mobs.  To me, that's pretty straightforward and simple (I could be wrong, but it wouldn't be the first time).  In any case, if we aren't going to make a rule one way or another, stfu and let's move on.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what happens with this situation, congratulate VoLS/CB for a job well done and quit making them look like jerks for doing something that took a lot of effort and planning on all parts and let them feel proud of what is a very real accomplishment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faylana>Faylana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoLS - GL</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/9/03 5:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=157>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.diamond-webdesigns.com/webmastercentral/images/pegasus.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> Well said!

<br>
Dytren, admitting to change the rules means admitting that the rules might have been wrong in the first place.  This is the brick wall you find yourself beating up against.<br>
<br>
For the record, I am -as a non-uber member of this community- completely against the rotation of flag mobs where an alternate, albeit individual and much slower, quest is available to get the same exact flag.  Doing so is paramount to using the rules of the community to contol the progress of other guilds who are thus affected by said rotation ...or as Gromm is so fond of mathematics, a+b=c.<br>
<br>
&quot;Extrapolation&quot; and &quot;Convention&quot; ...these are the methods we will use to dictate server policy from now on.  Get with the program, or /movelog, those are your two choices.<br>

That's such a tempting option. It is. That covers what... Behemoth, Grummus, and AD?<br>
<br>
Only problem is Gromm earlier pointed out: &quot;Hey, we can team on Behemoth and he's easy now, why don't we team on Rallos Zek?&quot; ... &lt;insert drama&gt;<br>
<br>
Either way, deciding on a set of rules that people will abide by and are consistant is best for all. <br>
<br>
At the moment it is true that there is only one visible POP Rotation [RZ]. At the moment there are no set rules on non-rotation mobs - such as Gorenaire or Aerin'Dar. If you want to team Gorenaire, go ahead... but we can't claim a double standard.<br>
<br>
Perhaps to set in stone:<br>
<br>
I) Grummus, Behemoth, and Aerin'Dar are teamable mobs<br>
II) No other POP encounter (including hedge maze) is teamable, treated as normal rotation mobs<br>
III) &lt;insert penalty here&gt; for breaking rule II<br>
<br>
The aims of the rules stated are:<br>
<br>
1) To give smaller guilds a way to access content that they could access invidually together (keep in mind that key quests now flag up to 6 people at a time...)<br>
<br>
2) To keep the &quot;advancement by merit&quot; as opposed to advancement by overwhelming force in progression through POP.<br>
<br>
3) To ensure that there is a clear dictum on what can be team killed and what cannot. Only three mobs were named.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, that's my $.02 before coffee, could be different after coffee...<br>

I have no problem being wrong, if you knew me in person, you'd know this.  Goodness knows I'm wrong often enough.  However, what you have is a small handfull of people who are responding to this thread saying &quot;teh rotations is teh suck on AD&quot;.  Up until now, the vast majority of the server thinks that rotations are, at worst, a necessary evil that we need to have.  All of a sudden, a mob appears that's only circumstantial difference is that you can kill it or quest it, your option, to get something it drops.  (Actually, this is not new either... Dain and the Tri-hackle gold-plated walnut cracker.)  In this case, it is a key that opens a door.<br>
<br>
So, the issue is that<br>
a) because the mob drops a key, and<br>
b) because you can also quest the key<br>
c) then the mob must have different rules<br>
<br>
c) does not necessarily follow a) + b) here<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me be very clear here:  to be very honest, I don't have a problem saying those mobs are FFA at all and that you can use everyone on the server plus your dog plus your mother-in-law to kill it.  However, I am not so quick to rush in and just say that &quot;sure, let's make em FFA&quot; without considering the other consequences such as the precedent it will set.  Yes, folks say &quot;it's only for this mob&quot; - famous last words.  I have no reason to believe that this isn't the first step in trying to extrapolate this reasoning onto other mobs.  It's what you call &quot;getting your foot in the door&quot;.  Once you open that can of worms, it's very difficult to put the lid back on.  (that enough cliches for you?)  Once you have this precedent, there is little to keep it from being used to extend it to everything else in the game.  Remember that in Law (such as real-life courts and stuff) precedence carries a *huge* weight in the interpretation of the laws and future/related laws and there are very clear reasons why this happens other than simply being some sort of procedure in the absense of others.  It's called logic and reasoning - which apply to all things whether it is  real life or discussions concerning actions in a game.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Extrapolation&quot; and &quot;Convention&quot; ...these are the methods we will use to dictate server policy from now on. Get with the program, or /movelog, those are your two choices.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are wrong.  These are what have always set policy.  The first &quot;official&quot; rotation was Trakanon.  When Talendor was killed, the rules for the Trakanon rotation were extrapolated to extend to Talendor (basically it was search-n-replace &quot;Trakanon&quot; with &quot;Talendor&quot; and *poof* you have the new rules).  As each mob was considered for rotation, the previous rules were simply extrapolated to cover them.  Now, there were a few other instances such as ToV-N where entrance to the rotation was secured simply by only killing Arryonyar - but you had to kill Arryonyar before you killed any other dragon back there.  Also, because of the undertaking, rules were required for extended stays - you get 48 hours to clear all of ToV-N or you pass what you haven't killed.<br>
<br>
By your logic, we should reconsider that rule of 48 hours since PoP is out now (2 expansions past ToV-N) and say that relative power has made the rotation so that you have to kill everything in 4 hours or pass, instead of 48.  I would imagine that folks wouldn't be happy about that.<br>
<br>
Another point, RTA hasn't in the past sanctioned rotions (remember, when I say this, it means that all the guilds agree to have a rotation on the mob) on mobs that you can kill with a single group, no matter how often they spawn.  Trakanon, Severilous, and a few others all fall into this category.  However, because of what they do represent, the majority in RTA still agrees to rotations on these mobs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Welcome to the BoTS-NB server ...most of us refer to it as The Rathe.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Calling this statement &quot;idiotic&quot; is about the best compliment I can give to it.  You simply have no idea how anything on this server works so you make statements such as this seeking to gain some form of popularity with some group for your &quot;bucking the system&quot;.<br>
<br>
BotS doesn't really care one way or the other about many of the mobs that are currently on rotation.  We show how much we care by being on the rotation for it or by actively killing the mobs.  We have nothing to gain or lose by saying that AD/Grummus/etc are or are not FFA.  However, opening the door for team effort on these mobs simply opens the door for team effort on everything else in the game - from Trakanon up to the PoTime.  THAT is what we are concerned about.<br>
<br>
Again, your pleas of &quot;only for this mob&quot; do little to persuade because precedent is much stronger than this simple phrase.  Your promises with &quot;pretty please with sugar on top&quot; are not sufficient to convince me, or anyone, that we aren't getting on the edge of a slippery slope.<br>
<br>
If you cannot see our side of the argument then we are at an impass.  I assure you that we see yours and take it into consideration when we form our opinion on the matter.  You need to convince me (and others) that this isn't simply a foot in the door.  I will say that the qualification (similar to what has been given already) of something like:<br>
<br>
Mobs that enable entry into further zones when killed - whether by dropping an item which enables entry either directly or by completing a quest for such a key, giving character flags, or by any other means not specifically mentioned here - that can also be bypassed by quests that provide an alternate path to entry to the further zones but the quest does not require killing said mob to complete the alternate-path quest, which also have been proven to not stir any interest because of other items that they may drop and, because of this, have been proven to remain &quot;up&quot; for long periods of time, are open to FFA rules.<br>
<br>
is a little better. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grommofbots>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 4/9/03 10:21:46
