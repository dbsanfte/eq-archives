Pretty cool rant eh?  After rereading it, I was pretty impressed.  I must of had a bad week. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But that doesn't change anything - the point still stands on it's own merit.<br>
<br>
Cenn had a legit gripe and vented about a single person.  This person is Zeksi, he vented at Cenn, so Cenn was upset and very nicely ranted.  Too bad, So Sad, Duel and get it over.  <br>
<br>
But Myst touted her GM status of Scions into this rant to turn the focus onto herself.  How does this lesson the actions of Zeksi?  Answer:  It doesn't.  I'm sure everything would be better if we just told Myst everytime some moron does something irritating.  But hell, Cenn didn't even mention Zeksi was a Scion and I'm sure 98% of EQ doesn't even know who Scions GM is.  <br>
<br>
If Myst had a talk with Zeksi and had something to share on how she handled it, I'd of enjoyed the read.  But she didn't!  She said &quot;don't rant about a Scion - tell me - I'm not the babysitter, but I care about all my children.  I like Zeksi.&quot;  Well excuse me, but that's lame!  <br>
<br>
How is a leader to get better unless someone sharpens them up and takes them to the task?  Answer is: THEY DON'T!  I didn't have to rave, but I did.  Notice Myst didn't write any lame comments back.  That's respectable.  Comments from a GM should have merit and morality.<br>
<br>
The merit and moral in the humble opinion of FRODOSON a plain old non-leadership newbie.<br>
<br>
Take responsibilities for your actions!  <br>
Right or wrong they're yours!<br>
Don't blame a guild for a fewls moments!<br>
Blame a guild for NOT taking action when action is due!<br>
<br>
Peace, rant on and prosper!<br>

<br>
A GM is NOT just a figure head who decides which of her members deserve the 'honor' of being officers, she is their leader. When it comes to situations like this, what would have been the harm in sending Mystamyr a tell saying 'listen, I don't know how you run things over there, but this guy Zeksi is being a dick and I'd like someone to do something about it' there's no EQ jail, there's no payment to dock, but why not bring difficulties to the person who's supposed to deal with those kinds of things ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Calling Myst 'lame' for defending the actions of someone she considers her friend is ridiculous. Shall she sit idly by whilst you rant on and on about her friend and guildmate ? Let you live and let live as you have so passionately decided NOT to let Zeksi ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Supreme fairness here on your part, thinking clearly, I assume.<br>
<br>
BTW ALOT more then 2% of the nameless knows Myst is the leader of SoV. I'd say the number is closer to your estimate of how many people DONT know she is.<br>
<br>
<br>
In summation, YOU made this about Myst, not her. She's looking after her own and you want time in the spotlight because you feel she stuck her nose in where it's not her business. I think it's funny that you tried to hijack this thread and make it about Myst for not minded her own business. Hello pot ? this is the kettle. You're black.<br>

<br>
I feel like I lectured myself.  You could be my twin sister Fridae (cept you're too tall).  Your wisdom is truly noted though, because what you say is true.  I respect any GM who has the qualities you forementioned.  We could argue forever, until we both realized we have the same opinions.  I can not speak for all your opinions, so read this overview and tell me your opinion.<br>
<br>
Don't forget this is a rant.  Zeksi (apparently) inappropriately extended conversation to Cenn, who rebuked him publicly for being a fewl.  Nice rebuke too.  Sure he could have called the guild master or an officer, but then he's open to pissing off a whole guild.  Hmmm decisions, decisions.  He made a choice, and blam Zeksi is publicly flamed.  Never smiting anyone's guild.<br>
<br>
I spoke to defend the rights of descent folk to publicly flame fewls for there fowl deeds.  Without involving guild deflamation, or asking permission from a faceless GM or officer of any guild, who in this case took no action except to tell the original ranter to go die.  I shamelously ridiculed the actions of a guild GM for mentioning her guild with nothing responsible to say.<br>
<br>
That's the Overview.<br>
<br>
My TRUE INTENTION - did you notice nobody has flamed the Scions in this thread?  The true underlying flame from this halfling is to thrash anyone who commits the haneous crime of ripping a guild for the actions of an individual.  Myst opened the door to thrash her guild and I closed it.  True justice is served by frying the fewl, not the (Guild, Country, Race, etc..)  A little bashing to open up ones senses is not the only way, not the best way, but it worked.  IMHO This is one small victory for my tiny little halfling cause.  <br>

Frodoson Enting (Black)<br>

I often sit in east commons and sell shit as different characters, when one day I was doing my normal running in a circle back by the merchants.  (Yes, I know its pathetic, but sometimes creating and designing characters is more fun then playing them.)  I was playing a level 1 half elf warrior at the time (name escapes me), and all of a sudden some fag named Zeksi walks up to me and says &quot;Can I at least have the spell?&quot;  I remember and have screenshots of the entire conversation.<br>
<br>
He accuses me stealing a bag, basically harrasses me, reports me, I report him for harassment.  Aparently the GM told him to go fuck himself, as I heard nothing about it ever again.  I'm still awaiting that apology, too, if you're ever man enough to admit you're wrong.<br>
<br>
Zeksi, stealing is wrong, but accusing someone of stealing that is innocent is much much more wrong.  The only thing that kept me from exploding in your face that day, was knowing that one of these days you'll see how stupid you really looked from my point of view, and the GMs point of view.<br>
<br>
PS.  Leave Mystamyr alone, or I eat you~<br>

Apparently, there was a post made on Scions board however, and I was curious as to the validity of the statements made therein.

If you guys want to blacklist me (in your little board room you guys have) that's cool to.  I think Zeksi is the only person I know from Scions, so it's not like I'm losing friends or sleep over it.

I Do not hold a guild responsible for one persons actions.  Of course, if later down the road I meet more scions and they behave as Zeksi has, then yeah, I would, but such hasn't been the case so far.  <br>

I first met him when I was level 35 in OT soloing things and I see a level 19 necromancer auctioning items far beyond his level. I /OOCed that this was not really his kind of zone, and that perhaps he should try Lake of Ill Omen. he sent me a tell saying that he was doing fine here, and that not to worry, he would be surpass my level regardless. This remark did anger me a bit, but I let it go.<br>
<br>
My next encounter with him was when I saw his name pop up in guild chat. It was a total and rather disheartening surprise. After querying officers as to how he entered our guild, as I never saw his appplicatoin, I was told he had been begging to get in for some time. So, I bit back my bile and gave him another chance.<br>
<br>
Besides expressing some of his views in guild chat that everyone disagreed with, something about loot , I can't remember, I pretty much forgot about him. he did  not participate in any raids, so I had no real contact with him. One night however, I was trying to camp in CT for some Darkforge piece for my SK,, as he could never find a good group that would pull crusaders. I found that Zeksi was also in teh zone, and so I aske dhim what he was up to. He said that he was camping the TR for ravenscale for his rogue twink. I then asked if hewould mind company while I camped the crusader spawn there too.<br>
<br>
I helped him for a while on the lower floor and we aquired him some ravenscale things, and about this time I asked if we could then go upstairs and try working to the Crusader spawn. We started to go up, cleared a few things, then he went back down to his own camp, as he thought separating was better. he then sent me numerous tell sin Gchat for assiatnce, saying he could not longer hold teh camp. I was busy fighting mine as well, so I told him he had better feign or zone. I believe somehow both of us ended up dying that night, and while I ran back fomr my bind point in Oasis, Zeksi kept camping.<br>
<br>
When I arrived back and retrieved my corpse, I had just found out that a very important person and former GL had left our guild. I was in tell hell with several members about it, and told Zeksi I was going to be sitting at the entrance for a while trying to talk this out. As I sat there, he became more and more pissed that Iwasn't helping him, said &quot;Fuck you you're stupid,&quot; and disbanded our group.<br>
<br>
That was Zeksi's last strike with me. After I finished talking with guildies about our member leaving, I then went back uptsiars to my spawn and continued camping it. Zeksi then sent me numerous tells asking why I wasn't dead yet, was I still there at the spawn, etc. I finally put him on ignore. I have never before and never since put a guildie on ignore. It was not a good night.<br>
<br>
So....no...I don't care for a person who kills every spawn in the zone in Najena whiel farming even though there are people there trying to get experience. No..I don't like someone who creates a character basically for farming(out of his own mouth). And yes, I think when someone goes through about 6 guilds...there's something wrong with them.<br>
