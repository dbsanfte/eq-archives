<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 6. In the rare event that the topside PCs generate enough hate to get turned on, they are Call of Hero'd or Resurrected out of danger.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This was portrayed as being a bad thing to do, if you read the thread I linked to.  Please explain, then, WTF CoH is for.  So I can get people into a raid late??  I suppose that's an exploit too, though.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 7. Once a cleric complete heals a couple of times, he is COH'd to relatively the same location (under the bridge) to remove hate. (We are not calling this an exploit, but COH might be changing in the future because this goes against the spell's intent).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ok, summoning them to a safe spot under the bridge is somewhat of an exploit - but the convicted party later states that the clerics were merely being summoned AWAY from the mob, near the entrance gates, and then they were running under the bridge (maybe).  That is the point of CoH - to get people out of danger.  A cleric playing tank is danger, and removing them with CoH is, in my opinion, a perfectly valid tactic.<br>
<br>
Not related to the CoH nerf I suspect is coming, but:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;8.5.4.2 The key to determining whether a person is exploiting is not in the activity, but is the intent. A player that is using a rain spell to kill masses of monsters may not know it's an exploit, but instead believe that this is simply the function of the spell. It is the responsibility of the Guide to educate the player and ensure that the intention to exploit is present.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
WHAT??  Ok, fine!  Make rain spells single-target only.  Yay for me, since I will have more spells to use under a crowd-controlled situation.  I suppose AoE's in general are huge exploits, and Scintillation should not be used to clear green mobs.  Instead, we should use it on blue mobs with no AE stuns so we can get killed.  &lt;3 VI.<br>

I'll be starting an enchanter or cleric soon.

<br>
1) VI releases zones with major bugs.  This is Verant's fault.  Instead of more fully testing zones before release, they rushed to sell Kunark and then SOV before they working properly.  (Anyone remember all the Kunark mobs that sounded like humans for a while?)<br>
<br>
2) Players test mob reactions and do whatever they can to win battles.  VI will punish players if VI feels the players exploited bugs to gain an advantage.  So somehow, players are supposed to know what is a bug and what isn't when trying out new tactics on high end mobs.   Instead, VI should be punishing itself for not fixing the bugs in the first place.<br>
<br>
Good thing VI doesn't own supermarkets, or they would have me arrested for stealing if a cashier undercharges me for my fruit.<br>
<br>
Funny enough, the motivation for the punishment was because supposedly their actions threatened to cheapen the game.<br>
<br>
Then I have to ask...what cheapens the game more?<br>
--Players using bugs in game to their advantage, or<br>
--VI leaving bugs in game, or<br>
--VI spending time punishing players for exploiting bugs, when they should be putting those resources to fixing more bugs in the first place.<br>
<br>
That's the real mind blower here.  Verant employees wasting their employees time and energy to monitor players and punish them.  Those same employees should instead be either:<br>
--working on fixing bugs, or<br>
--addressing customer problems in the game.<br>
<br>
Customers are more concerned about VI fixing bugs and addressing their complaints, their not as concerned about other guilds exploiting bugs.<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, the punishment is more like a show of force by Verant employees.  Those VI employees have forgotten is that players are customers, not criminals.   <br>

They got caught exploiting a safe area most likely.<br>
<br>
My point is, it's Verant's fault that these &quot;safe areas&quot; exist in the first place.<br>
<br>
EQ has so many bugs it's quite frankly ridiculous. <br>
<br>
From the thread Cobee posted a link to, it looks like Brad and other VI employees took some time to look through various logs to justify the punishment.  Yet how many of us have had GMs say their couldn't help you in response to a petition?  Then you later apply more pressure and finally they take the time to look into the logs and find out your complaint was valid?<br>
<br>
Bottom line:  Verant is just using that guild as an example since it's a high profile incident.   But if Verant got it's act together and fixed more of the bugs in EQ, they wouldn't have to worry about monitoring exploits in the first place.<br>
<br>
What the real story here?  Cashola of course.<br>
<br>
Verant releases new parts to EQ like Kunark, SOV, and soon Shadows of Luclin to earn more money.  The sooner they release them, the sooner they get more cash.  They don't mind releasing them full of bugs cause they know customers will buy them anyway.<br>
<br>
What about punishing people for exploiting bugs?  More cash for VI.  Someone who plays EQ a great deal and is banned will likely just buy another EQ box or buy someone else's account....that's basically another 10 bucks a month that keeps flowing to VI.<br>
<br>
As far as protecting the game as Brad suggests?  Hehe, he wants to make sure it takes players a while to conquer these new areas and mobs.  The longer it takes players to do so, the longer they keep playing EQ and paying that monthly fee.  He's not protecting the game for customers, he's protecting it for VI.<br>
<br>
Why can VI treat customers this way?  Cause there's not any real competition for them....yet.<br>

After reading the GMs statements as was displayed by conquest, the initial response by VI on the subject, the entire e-mail correspondence between members of Conquest and VI, I believe the following things:<br>
<br>
1) Conquest knew the tactics were a bit questionable, but had sufficient reason to believe that they were sanctioned by VI.<br>
<br>
2) Members of Conquest have a far better understanding of the dynamics of these types of fights than anyone at VI<br>
<br>
3) Verants position is based wholly on trying to save face from a number of bad gaffes on there part.<br>
<br>
Terming this an &quot;exploit&quot; is ludicrous in the extreme. Hey, you have to be exploiting if it only takes 28 people operating with precision coordination and quite frankly some ingenious tactics in order to get their heads handed to them by a single mob. <br>
<br>
No, the correct way to attack this mob is to get 60 people and zergling rush it until its dead. Those who try and find better tactics will be summarily banned for exploiting.

Until people realize that they are only supporting this behavior by BUYING the broken product, companies will continue this trend.  Look at WW2OL, what a piece of @#%$ @#%$ on the day of release, yet people still support it by buying the product.<br>
<br>
If people would wake up and realize that by buying broken toys they are encouraging the broken toy industry, then maybe companies would COMPLETE a project before releasing it.<br>
<br>
Until then Maob, your arguement is pointless.  It's a damn shame, too.<br>

Hopefully one of these new games will have a completely different attitude towards everything.  Hopefully they will have a great customer service base.  Hopefully they will release a COMPLETED game.  Hopefully someone &quot;gets it right.&quot;<br>

McQuaid.</span><hr size=1> ..... multiple people have been given warnings for using &quot;safe spots&quot;.  This has never been a sanctioned thing.  Ever.<br>
<br>
CoH being used to clear aggro is fine.  Always has been.  In fact, CoH was CHANGED to clear aggro because when at first it didn't, NPCs in old world (planes) would chase players clear across the zone and cause massive trains.  That wasn't the intent of the spell.  CoH being used to summon players out of danger and clear their aggro &gt;so they can then run to a safe spot and avoid danger period&lt; is not ok.  That's an exploit of the game mechanics.<br>
<br>
Using rez effects, which were intended to keep someone from being immediately hasted and being at nearly full fighting capacity after being rezzed, to circumvent not only an AoE slow effect but also the entire AoE is an exploit.  They knew this, and had been warned of it previously.<br>
<br>
Their own guild log shows that they were aware that what they were doing was using exploits.<br>
<br>
Their own leadership admitted that they knew what they were doing was an exploit, then tried to justify it by saying &quot;Well everyone else does it.&quot; when in fact it's nowhere near as common as they tried to play off.  And VI DOES do something about it when they catch people.  I've been involved in both catching (as a Guide) and being caught (as a player).  They don't ignore it.<br>
<br>
VI leaving bugs in the game is going to happen.  There's not a single game out period right now that I can think of that doesn't have bugs.  Conquest was suspended because they knowingly and willingly used multiple exploits/bugs to do something.  VI suspended them as a warning.  Will those exploits be fixed?  Yes, more than likely.  Eventually.  They don't really have a large staff, and they can't fix everything immediately.  IMO coming down hard on someone who did that kind of crap serves as a pretty good warning to others not to try the same thing, and gives them time to fix it. &lt;shrug&gt;<br>
<br>
You guys are missing a key point here:  the point of the game is not to deliberately cheat because of &gt;bugs&lt; in the game.  Tactics are one thing.  Strategy is one thing.  Exploits are by nature not supposed to be there, and if you plan on using them, you have no right whatsoever to whine and complain for getting nailed to the wall for it. :P<br>
<br>
Maob, while I agree with the second point you made to an extent.... this wasn't people testing how NPCs react.  If it had been, I'd have been firmly on the side of Conquest on this.  But this was people deliberately using how NPCs to react to do something that the game was not designed or intended for them to do, and doing it even though they knew they weren't supposed to be doing so.<br>

This seems to be what Verant wanted with the spell, a way to get someone to you, or summon someone out of danger, but not a full agro wipe. Can't say I am happy about it though. =oP<br>

<br>
If you look at the dialog, Conquest never claimed to be using the bridge as a safe spot. They even gave pretty good arguments why it wouldnt work. Bottom line, I dont think you can claim they recieved all that much advantage other than getting their casters out of AoE breath attacks.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> CoH being used to clear aggro is fine. Always has been. In fact, CoH was CHANGED to clear aggro because when at first it didn't, NPCs in old world (planes) would chase players clear across the zone and cause massive trains. That wasn't the intent of the spell. CoH being used to summon players out of danger and clear their aggro &gt;so they can then run to a safe spot and avoid danger period&lt; is not ok. That's an exploit of the game mechanics.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Players arent supposed to sit around and try to figure out what the programmers intent for including a spell was. They are simply supposed to use the spell. If its overpowered, readjust the spells. Dont ban people for it.<br>

<br>
Other uber guilds in Sleepers have been praised by GMs for using buff stacking to get around AE effects. Id say that pretty much official sanctioning, dont you think?<br>
<br>
My thoughts on this pretty much echo a quote that popped up on Lumthemad<br>
<br>
Bottom line, what harm did conquest do to the game that required a banning? Pretty much none. Killed VI's warders too easily for their liking? Probably, after all terrible thing to show someone that players are more inventive than they thought. Is it within VIs right to ban Conquest? They sure are. That doesnt mean that they are doing in these places and how they are dealing with Conquest doesnt stink to high hell.<br>
<br>
Really, I could honestly care less what happens to Conquest. What bothers me is the utter contempt that VI is showing toward players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uportaofluclin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Porta of Luclin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Legionairre</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/01 11:29:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm, I quit - giving my account to B.

What the heck were AoE spells for anyways?  Just to break mez?  To aggro through floor on buggy zones?  To kill members of your group on PvP servers?  That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.<br>
<br>
CoH clearing aggro an exploit?  &quot;Call of the Hero&quot;, calling him/her to safety in a bad situation.  It is not called CotLC &quot;Call of the Late Comer&quot; for god's sake.  Makeing this spell only good for calling in people to a raid is about as stupid as saying and making wizards taxi's with 16&quot; guns.  Mages have trouble finding a true use as it is.  Most zones are to screwy for pets to be effective.  They want to reduce them to calling in late comers and popping mod rods only.  BAH!<br>
<br>
Using safe areas sucks.  It is an exploit that has been known about forever.  Use it and risk getting in trouble.  Remember the wall in Dalnirs that casters, druids mostly, could cast on a mab and not get touched?  How many people did I see get warned by a GM for standing there?  How many times did we chew cheaters out for using that place?  If you are gonna use a bug like that then be prepared to pay the price.<br>

And using res to cancel out an effect, etc...makes perfect friggin sense...Whenever we (the players) find a NEW - unintended use for a skill or spell or item, Verant flips out and changes it immediately....Feign Death being one of them..Feign Death has been nerfed to the point where monks are damn near useless..but everyone still FD pulls..GMs have STATED that you can be banned for FD pulling - because its using a skill that wasn't intended to be used that way, np. /wave monks.<br>

McQuaid.</span><hr size=1> This is just another perfect example of how little Verant actually understands their own game.  If you read through the entire email exchange between the Conquest guildleader and Brad, you'll see there are at least 3 or 4 separate occasions where the guy from Conquest is actually explaining the way the game works to Brad, who had quite a few things wrong, and couldn't even be bothered to check before putting himself on the spot by giving bad info.<br>
<br>
I think the banning was even partly motivated by the fact that Conquest helped to reveal just how unfinished the zone was.  I'd be willing to bet that at release the zone was probably 50% finished at best, because I'm sure Verant was saying to themselves, &quot;Bah, don't worry about it.  We'll patch it later, they won't be here for another year,&quot; when on literally every single occasion, people have proven that they will do things two or three times faster than Verant planned for, thus pointing just how unfinished their product is.<br>
<br>
Add to that the fact that they seem to take the defeat of end-game mobs personally, and you end up with those insane arbitrary penalties.  If a group of people tries to use any tactic other than a rush, Verant deems it an exploit and nerfs whatever is necessary without thought of the consequences.  As far as the CoH issue goes, I fully expect them to nerf the aggro-clearing on it in one of the next few patches, then probably nerf the spell to uselessness when people complain about how it's now the cause of huge trains and massive exp loss.  Verant lacks the creativity and ingenuity to come up with anything other than a rush, so they get indignant when someone else does.  It's silly and insulting to consistently maintain an attitude like that, especially after they've had two years of people surpassing all their expectations.  Suck it up and learn from your mistakes, Verant.  It's obvious other companies are starting to, judging from a lot of what I've seen in the AO beta.<br>
<br>
I find it completely ridiculous that they would call using something like spell stacking an exploit.  It's Verant's responsibility to figure out issues like that and decide what's going to stack with what.  It's not the players' responsiblity to discover something as mundane as spell-stacking and determine whether or not it's &quot;fair&quot; to a mob that can summon you, aggro on you through a wall and do all kinds of other completely unfair things.  Exploitation of safe spots and such is one thing, but calling a spell-stacking bug an exploit is quite another.<br>
<br>
I'm tempted to write another full-length novel/rant about this, but there's just no point.  All I'll give them is a resounding &quot;BLECH&quot; for gross stupidity. <p>Felwig Figwellen <BR>
