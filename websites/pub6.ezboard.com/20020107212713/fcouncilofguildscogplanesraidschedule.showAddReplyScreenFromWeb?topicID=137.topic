<br>
As usual i had a great time, i just felt like i had to say something so here are my comments:<br>
<br>
Breakin went smooth, and the mage CoH worked great even though it did take some time, but it would probably have taken the same amount of time with a CR if it was dont in another way so this part i want to compliment on.<br>
<br>
It seemed it was clerics day! Every cleric got at least one item there - congratulations to all the clerics there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I want to ask a questiong - where were all the female forsaken revenants??? that was so provoking, that not a single female forsaken revenant showed her face! I think Verant was punishing all the enchanters for something on that raid.. or maybe the female revs were just afraid of us.. yeah that must be it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, all did a great job - too bad we didnt get to fight Maestro inside his building where there were room for it.<br>
<br>
I hope this isnt the end of CoG raids, if i can be of any help to continue CoG raids in the future, please let me know.<br>

It was a good raid.  I think the CotH method worked very well, although Barbs told me that I'd have to do it next time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Anyone got a spare copy? lol<br>
<br>
I also liked the fact that gems were lottoed at the end of the raid.  I'm sure this will encourage people to stay for the long-run, and it takes less time overall to hand the loot out.<br>
<br>
Speaking of loot, there was one incident that really bothered me, and I feel that it needs to be addressed now so that it does not happen again.  I am refering to the incident when one cleric decided she did not want the peice of armor that she had won.  Now, graciously she let the next highest roller loot the armor.  The decision was then made that the next armor drop would go to her.  That decision was wrong.  Let me show you why by giving an example:<br>
<br>
    Mananin wants an Apothic Kilt, because he is Scottish and it just seems right.  Manny does not particularly want the Apothic Boots though.  Well, after an intense battle with a male forsaken revenant, what should happen to drop but Apothic Boots.  Manny doesn't want these, however, since there are 12 other magicians in the raid, and the likelihood of getting anything on this raid is remote, he comes up with an idea.  Mwahahahaha!  He's going to roll for the boots, even though he doesn't want them.  In fact, he has no intention of looting them should he win!  Mwahahahaha! <br>
   After a particularly intense roll-off with the 12 other mages, he wins with a roll of 3!  Wow, what are the odds?  The next highest roll was by Gimpy the Naive, with a 2.  &quot;But wait!&quot;  Mananin says in ooc. &quot;I have boots that are better, so Gimpy, you take them, and I will take the next drop.&quot;  <br>
    Well, lo and behold what should drop next but the Apothic Kilt!  &quot;Mwahahaha! Suckers!&quot; Manny thinks to himself as he gleefully loots the kilt, while 11 mages stare in silent envy.   Succumbing to the dark side, Mananin shouts &quot;All praise our lord and creator, Innoruuk!&quot;, and proceeds to train the Maestro on the raid party. <br>
<br>
Now I'm not suggesting that this is what happened Sunday night, nor am I accusing anyone of this, but do you see the problem here?  The loot system can be abused in order to get a better item by making a phony roll.  What bothered me the most on Sunday was that the cleric was given free reign to loot whatever she wanted off of the HIGH PRIEST, who just so happened to drop THE HAMMER, which is a GOD LOOT from INNORUUK!  The 6 other clerics on the raid didn't even get to roll for it. That was unfair and wrong.<br>
<br>
If someone wins a roll and decides they don't want it, they should not be allowed to loot whatever drops next.  If you don't want it, than you forfeit your roll and must roll again like everyone else for the next drop.  Tough.  Do your research, and know what it is you want and don't want, and if you don't want something, than DON'T ROLL FOR IT!  This also goes back to my earlier post that God Loot items be considered like BPs and robes.  Everyone should be able to roll for God Loot regardless of whether or not they won a piece of armor earlier (although personally I think if someone won a BP or robe on that raid, they should not get a God Loot on that same raid).  Like I said before, spread the love and share the wealth.<br>

She was awarded the next drop not because she didn't want the piece, but because it was looted in error by another person due to my own mistake. Her not getting the original piece was my fault, not hers. Therefore, as the winner of the lotto, she was give the next piece that dropped if she did not already have that piece. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If there was a regular piece on the high priest that should have been the piece she won. afterall god loot is still god loot and I'd be whoppin mad if a mistake happened and I didn't get my one in a million shot at my epic too. But past is past granted.<br>
Right now all of FoF is going over the rules set out by SB for the raids they held and are making minimal course corrections here and there. One we are all strong on is that the BP, legs and God loot be all 1 roll. No one should be able to walk away with possibly all 3 in 1 night we feel so thats a probability for ammendment. We'll post a list of the original rules and our revised ones when we're ready.<br>
<br>
PS. we would start running raids right away but our guild leader lost his isp (they went bankrupt) and he asked us to wait for him.<br>

The cleric in question HAD attempted to cede her drop to another cleric in /ooc.  Now whether or not something /ooc'd is considered to be binding is something for the loot coordinator to decide.  But she did declare in a public channel she didnt want them and wanted them to go to another cleric.  Now they were ultimately looted by the next highest rolling cleric which I think was the right thing.  After all, the concensus does seem to be that if you win the roll on an item you dont want, then you dont get to choose who it goes to, it goes to the next highest roller.  Which is the whole point of lottoing the loot anyway.  And I can honestly say that having ceded her right to the armor drop she should not have been awarded straight out any other loot automatically.  And she definetly should not have been allowed to choose to loot the hammer.  God loot is god loot.  That being said, as Lag said the past is the past, we just need to move forward.  I do just want to say that this is not meant as a criticism of Dogedme or the management team.  At that point in the raid things were very hectic and mistakes happen.  They did the best they could and for me at least, thats more than good enough.  Mistakes happen (never in my favor of course, but I keep hoping...IRS hear my plea...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Just something to keep in mind for the future however.<br>
<br>
Now all that having been said let me say the raid in general was a lot of fun and quite successful (especially for you clerics out there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  We took about 60 people on in and I believe we only had 3 deaths.  A 5% death rate on break in is quite remarkable.  Even for an uber guild and its something we shoudl be proud of.  Even if we &quot;cheated&quot; a bit with CotH.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now I know that many people see this as an acceptable use to available resources, much like using succor to get across SG to WW, I do sort of miss the adrenaline rush of running through Hate wondering if I'm going to die this time and how long it'll take to do so.  One concern I do have about this method, however, is that Plane raiding is not the goal in and of itself.  I see it not just as a Plane raid but also training for other harder raids in the future.  Raids on the Grotto or the Necropolis or Velks and Kael and the like.  To do these raids we need everyone to know how to get to camps without training.  We need them to have experience in long dangerous runs and how to deal with them.  Now I agree the CotH method is great if the people already have this experiece and it really cuts down on the break in.  I believe we were raiding in abot an hour and a half which is really good.  But my experiece is that it would be better for CoG in the long run to do it the hard way and call the raid a bit early than to take an easier way and pay for it later.  But thats just my 2cents.  I personally did like the almost no deaths on breakin myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Congrats.<br>
<br>
My major concern on the raid, however, is pretty much the same one I've always had.  People need to pay attention to what the Raid Commander says.  And I dont mean saying , &quot;yeah we heard you, now go pull us the phat lewt.&quot;  I mean actually following directions.  Like getting off the wall.  I dont know how many times this was said, but even at the end of the raid, there were still people on the wall!  I dont care if he did or did not give a reason for getting off the wall.  I dont care if you had a reason for being up there.  I dont even care if the Raid Commander was on drugs and was giving suicidal orders.  If the Raid Commander says something you do it.  Period.  You dont question it, you dont ignore it, you dont go back to doing whatever it was 5 minutes later.  If you dont agree with their orders you can always leave the raid, but if you stay you follow them unhesitatingly and without question.  If you disagree /talk to your group leader but in the meantime do what you're told.  Its for the raids best intrest even if it might not be in your particular best intrests.  The raid comes first before anyone.  This also applies to fighting mobs.  I know the tendency is to pull the mob as far back to the wall as possible.  This is a good thing generally.  But when the mob gets ON the wall, you need to pull him back.  Everyone needs to pull him back.  Dont wait for the main assist to move back, dont wait for the raid commander to yell at you to do so.  When you see the mob on the wall, pull back.  It seems pretty simple to me.  I understand issues about lag and all that.  But also remember when fighting these mobs if you're in the back the people in the front might not be able to move back and thus pull the mob back till you do.  So especially if you're towards the back disengage and pull back.  If mob corpses are lost in the wall there will be some very unhappy people out there, and you dont want them yelling at you.  Its annoying and very unproductive.  So listen up and follow directions and even more importantly keep an eye out FOR those directions.  On a raid saying &quot;I didnt see that&quot; really isnt an excuse.  Even if true it can still get everyone killed.  Experience means to anticipate orders before they are given so that you are already leaning in the right direction when they're finally issued.<br>
<br>
Now dont get me wrong on any of this please, the raid was wonderful.  It was a heads and shoulder's improvement over our last one.  People for the most part did follow orders and we really kicked ass.  IT was for the most part very enjoyable for all and I heard few if any complaints.  That is a Good Thing.   Really.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I know I was certainly proud of my group and how they functioned.  Granted they were almost all experienced Planes raiders, but from what I saw pretty much everyone else did well too.  The problems I described above were by no means the norm and were really only isolated incidents.  I just wanted to get people aware to them before they became major incidents <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>

To all of you who went on the raid, congratulations.  For those of you who never lost your sense of humor and who were willing to take the good with the bad I congratulate you.  For those of you who didnt win anything, I say stop using my dice they're weighted to roll 1's.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   For the last SB run raid I can only call this a major success and a great way to cap off a successful series of Planes raids.  I for one will miss raiding the Planes with you.  To the Group Sex pullers, I appreciate the pulls you did (epecially those 2 sprite golems <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and I thank you for a wonderful job and all the deaths you took on our behalf.  You did so with humor and with good spirits and were always ready for the next pull.  This to me was an example that all the other groups should be aspiring to.  Congratulations on a raid well done, and here's to many more in the future.<br>

Congratz to all that walked away with goodies.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would like to address some of the issues brought up here.  First the issue with the high priest loot and the conduct of the participants afterwards.  I am not taking sides on the issue at this time.  But whether it was right or wrong, it was in the shout by management team that she loot the hammer.  After doing so, I'm sure she really appreciated those tells from other yelling and cursing her out.  Do you think this is appropriate conduct on their part?  I think not.  She is following instructions here people.  If there was a problem, take it up with management since it was their decision.  This conduct was quite upsetting in my humble opinion.<br>
<br>
Another issue is the mob on the wall.  It was a problem throughout the night, but I did see everyone make an effort to stay off the walls.  And I also notice that people keep yelling 'GET OFF THE WALLS', and becoming upset at those who were still on the wall.  I dunno if you notice this, but those mobs have the ability to summon you to them.  Backing off doesnt' necessarily mean they are going to follow you down.  More than likely you'll be summoned up.  <br>
<br>
Just my two cents worth.  Anyway, long live CoG! <p><center><img src="http://www.engtong.com/rainmakers/images/rainmakersig.gif">

If the decision was wrong then why didn't anyone say anything DURING the raid eh eh eh?  When management made the decision to let her loot next drop no one complained.  Its only CAUSE of the OUTCOME that some of you all are complaining.  And WHAT IF the cleric didn't get another loot at all, for the whole night?  I bet no one would care to complain.  Either way, rules are set by the guild leading the raid and they were ok with it.  <br>

First off, I was not criticizing either the cleric involved nor the raid management team.  My post there was meant to make sure a similar situation did not occur in the future.  Now then, my understanding of why people did not complain was not that the cleric was supposed to get the next piece that dropped, but that she would get the next ARMOR piece that dropped.  The hammer is not a normal item, it is a God Item that previously dropped off Inny.  That makes it a special item and falls under a seperate tier on the loot table.  That she got it without anyone else rolling was a mistake.  After all, what about all those clerics that had not won anything to date on that raid (3 that I know of) and had not rolled on the disputed item (cleric leg armor) because they already had it?  That meant that they did not even get a chance to roll on a God Item.  This seems rather unfair to them.  Regardless, however, that is still no excuse for people harrassing players.  In the event the cleric did not do anything wrong and was simply responding to what she was told.  If people did hassass her, she should have talked to her group leader who would have talked to the management team.  I can assure you that action would then have been taken.  The management team that led the raid would not let someone get away with abusing another player no matter what the provocation.<br>
<br>
Now for all that, we did good in Hate.  There were errors and there were mistakes.  But we overcame and we prevailed.  Well, till the Maestro came out to play, but thats a whole different story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  We all just need to remember that our primary purpose for being there is to have fun and experience things we never have before.  Loot really should be a secondary concern. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

KCoG plane raid rules state that complaints in public channels will not be tolerated.  After a short discussion with him, I decided not to pursue the complaint further during the raid so as not to bog things down.  That is why I brought this up on the KCoG boards.  And yes, if anyone harrassed the cleric who looted the hammer, that was a pretty stupid and shameful thing to do to.  Personally, I don't think it was anyone in particular's fault, but rather a result of miscommunication and a lack of a clear looting policy regarding God Loot and also ceding a won-lotto to another player.  I'm happy that the cleric got the hammer, because hey, it's better than no hammer dropping, right?  I just felt sorry for the other clerics, and I hope in the future this doesn't happen again.  I know that if this had happened with the Staff of Earth Elemental Mastery, every mage on the raid would be screaming and howling in rage.<br>

BTW- Val, Magi P'Tsaka wasn't too hard.  He killed three or four of us, but that's it.  He's definitely easier than the Maestro.  I didn't see a pet anywhere, but to be safe, I cast annul magic on him many times to make sure any damage shield was neutralized.  He has pretty darn high MR though, I couldn't get Malosi to stick after 4 tries, so I gave up.  My guess is he has around 20,000 to 30,000 hps.  <br>
