<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But with the current situation with AD and friends, restricting the manner that they are killed is putting a gate accross 80% of the stairwell, and hoping that's enough. The zone is accessable, and sooner or later there is going to be an influx of *everyone* into the zone; though more immediately pressing this way, at least the response can be loud and clear and understood by all in this way, rather than rules being talked about under the growing numbers of people who don't know, or are not interested enough in the zone to read the rules.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And if this was just about restricting access to an xp zone that isn’t near as good as people think, you would be right.  However, those who quest past Aerin Dar end their PoP progression right there.  They can do the HoH trials (I use the term can *very* loosely, by it I mean they can activate it), but they cannot zone into HoH B and kill Mithaniel Marr, who is needed for Sol Ro and Elemental access.  So while yes, with the quest we may wind up with 5000 people in the zone, they won’t be teaming on Mithaniel Marr.  It won’t even be an option.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In this 'all at once' position, at least the publicity of the rules and the discussion will make the procedures known very early on; to use a phrase, the argument to regulate admission to the planes that can be quested past, is polishing the brass on the titanic.

<br>
Rogg, there has always been a concern about what information to release and at what time.  BOTS finds out how the Cursed cycle works. . . if they immediately share how to get Glyphed to spawn, they have just reduced the amount of time they have to get what they need off it and move on.  Now SoT and Tindi learn the secret. . .and there becomes a problem of people blowing Cursed spawns, accidentally or intentionally, and something needs to be done.  Do you post now that people have to stay out of the basement and in explaining why, basically offer them the information it took you some pains to find out on your own?  I would argue, that is much like telling the passerby on the street the make and model of your security system – most wouldn’t do anything with the information other than look at you funny.  Some however would come back later at night or while you were away and take advantage of the information.  What is wrong with this?  Well, any individual guild progressing on their own, no big woop, but many times the posted rotations and rotation rules, give out information to folks who really wouldn’t have found out until much later.  Please note how many guilds recently joined the G/E rotation very shortly after the post about Ssra basement.  <br>
<br>
So how does that relate to now?  Up till now nothing has been posted about the HoH trials, just so that people who would blow them don’t get a “How To” post.  It’s been a private tell from one GL to another, “Hey, make sure your guild doesn’t do X to Y, or you can blow trials”.  The unstated, and it doesn’t really need to be verbalized, is, “we’re operating under the golden rule, you don’t blow trials for us, we won’t blow them for you”.  And that works when you’ve been dealing with the same known quantity for so long.  I know that if I mess up shit for BOTS, BOTS can mess up shit for me, so even if I weren’t a considerate person, I’m smart enough to know, without any pride getting in the way, that when Emil tells me “watch out for this”, he isn’t so much telling me “what to do”, but warning me of things that could negatively impact others.  Many of the people in this thread, I do not think would handle this in the same way, and would take it as many have the Ssra basement issue “You can’t tell me what to do, wtf you think you are Mr High and Mighty, blah blah”.  If you need an example, there are several above.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> The difference is that the emperor needs to be killed to complete the quest, AD/Grummus/Behemoth do not. On top of that, I believe the emperor spawns after a sequence of kills (? I'm not there yet) so the situation, despite its similarities is quite different.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not true, it is an identical situation.  The VT quest may be longer, but you need a key to fight Emp, you need a key to fight Grummus, AD, or Behemoth.  Killing each of them is required to enter a new zone.  Also the Emperor spawns shortly after Blood is killed, very much how Behemoth is a delayed spawn.  Aerin Dar is always up as is Grummus, but I don’t see how when a mob spawns has anything to do with whether or not they provide keys/flags to new zones.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> My argument is that AD/Grummus/Behemoth will not be killed for its loot.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Then you would be wrong.  NB plans on killing Behemoth for his loot alone (as all of us are flagged for PoT, but he has some very nice items).  AD you are right, being that we are in Ssra and VT, he doesn’t have anything we are overly interested in.  The necklace is good, but that’s it (for us).  Grummus has crap loot however you slice it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> The mandate of the RTA is to ensure equal access to content.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You forget the last half of that line, “by those entities that can kill said content *on their own*.  Nowhere was it intended to share content with ad hoc alliances.  Each entity gets their share protected, at the expense of not being able to kill it at whim.  For the larger guilds, this slows them down, but makes sure they can plan at set times to do X mob.  For the smaller guilds, it lets them see content that on other servers, they could never dream of, for at least 2 expansions.  If you want to team, then team, but do so as an alliance for all rotations so you aren’t doubling up on other rotations and getting more than your fair share.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> How many people do you see killing Sev, and not following the rotation just so they can get scales for their epic? How many other highly contested Rotations do you see violated because of needed loot? To all of a sudden be worried about RZ being teamed when it is on rotation is absurd. I think evryone who posts for or against the teaming on these 3 mobs, all agree and follow the rules of this community, and you have NO premise to think otherwise.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
All Sev gives is dot fund loot.  RZ gives access to the best loot in the game.  Your argument would be that we shouldn’t lock the bank vault doors with $50 million inside just because no one has stolen the mints from the bank manager’s candy jar. . yet, except for those three times last year, and that once at Easter before that (pointing out there HAVE been blatant violations in the past, you’re just choosing to ignore them, or don’t remember them).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Sorry Emil but the Emperor is not a fair comparision to AD, MB, and Grummus. There is NO quest to access Vex Thal without killing the Emperor. Unless it's been the best kept secret on all servers. I can access Drunder by doing a quest or by killing MB. I can only access Vex Thal by killing the Emperor. This comparison is no different than comparing Sontalek to Grummus.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And by doing the quest instead of killing MB, you will *never* get to RZ or the Elemental planes.  You *must* kill these three mobs to progress in PoP, doing the quest gets you a 100% different flag for the zone.  The quest flag gets 6 people in for xp, but no further progression.  The kill flag gets just you in, but allows you to progress further in PoP.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I can respect your opinion and concern, about a group of 75 saying who cares about the RTA and breaking the agreed upon rules.

<br>
If you think the big three wouldn’t be able to remove almost all possible content from such malcontents, you’re not aware of what is possible.  They wouldn’t be able to kill much, because there wouldn’t be much up to kill.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Let's be honest if I wanted I could take TMS and another guild and head straight for the elemental planes. And say screw the RTA. But hey all I did was create an alliance then. Rotations collaps for those guilds. Now maybe I didn't do it in the nice polite way of saying it up front, but it is the same result. You all have said you respect Alliances that work up to the elemental planes. So where is the problem here? If this group respects the rotations there should be no issue.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No Vorth, there is a difference here and a world of one at that.  Alliances still work within the rotations, but as one entity.  A rogue alliance would be going FFA on any mobs they felt like, and as such would create a fairly big reaction from the rest of the server.  They would have trouble finding RTA guilds leaving mobs up for them to try.  I also disagree that there is as much reason to do so now when they aren’t past AD as there would be with nothing in the way but RZ.  Which is harder to keep control on, your date shaking your hand at the beginning of the date, or her dry humping you in her panties?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> TMS is currently entering Drunder.

What is to stop you?  Well, there names are in no particular order – Terris Thule, Agnarr, Mithaniel Marr, Rydda Dar, Grummus, Caprin, Bertox, Saryn, Tallon, Vallon, and amazing gear deficiencies.  It took BOTS and Tindi, both VT-geared guilds 15+ times each to kill RZ, but yah, 1/2TMS/1/2SOY are just gonna steamroll him, right?  Cause your main tanks have the same 9800+ hp that Kapen and Tankish do?  Your 10-12 L 65 clerics all have FT 15 too, to keep up with the 20-30 min fight, right?<br>

How many times have you teamed on these mobs?

Nope, you don’t have to be a part of the RTA at all.  You can try and find RZ up, but since he’s perma-killed by the current two entities on his rotation, I doubt you’d find it easy to get shots at him.  No one is forced into anything, but then being outside the RTA means no restrictions and no benefits.  Kill what you want when you want, but don’t plan on it being up when you want to kill it.<br>

<br>
Requirements to encounter mob: <br>
Emp - timesink, keying and bane'ing up your entire guild.<br>
AD - timesink, flagging your raid force for PoV, then completing the door key.<br>
<br>
Difficulty:<br>
Emp - fullish raid.<br>
AD - fullish raid.<br>
<br>
Rewards gained:<br>
Emp - 3 loots (sub par to the top loot in the game, however nice) 1 spell, 40 'accesses' to a new zone.<br>
AD - 2 loots (sub par to the top loot in the game, however nice) 2 spells, 72 'accesses' to a new zone.<br>
<br>
The Fight:<br>
<br>
Emp - Kill a mob / control 8 mobs, he spawns, you kill.<br>
AD - Kill him, 8 mobs pop, you kill.<br>
<br>
In absolute terms, the only difference between Emp and AD, is that you will have to kill Emp 2 times for every one time you have to kill AD, for the new zone access.<br>
<br>
Why farm emp? The kill is (relatively) hard, it takes time to move to ssra, set up, and kill him (1-2 hours).  Why kill him after you are done flagging?  The items off him, while nice can easily be replaced with better (and much more than 3 per kill) items from VT.<br>
<br>
Why (not) farm AD?  The kill is (relatively) hard, it takes time to move to PoV, set up, and kill him (1-2 hours).  Why (not) kill him after you are done flagging?  The items off him, while nice can (not) be easily replaced with better (and much less than 3 per kill) items from HoH (unless you have plans to move to a zone that actually will offer items that are better than AD).<br>

Don't like to share?  Actually, we have no problem sharing FCFS mobs.  Want content we can take whenever we want?  Yes, it's nice to find a FCFS mob up and go out to kill it.  We normally send out scouts to different zones to see what is up.  Team up at our leasure?  We've teamed up with other guilds to kill an epic mobs.  So yes, I feel we do enjoy that freedom.<br>

We normally don't team up because we normally have no need to.  However, teaming up for several encounters have been brought up in guild before.  The 10th Ring War is one such example were we discussed teaming up with another guild.  Depending on the encounter and situation, the loot rules could have been altered.<br>

Being outside the RTA has its pros and cons just like being in the RTA has its pros and cons.  I'm sure if non RTA guilds started killing rotation mobs whenever they had the chance, that would cause a huge problem.  In the early days of the RTA, non participating guilds were subjected to harsh things because they did not go along with the RTA.

I can say I understand the posts very well.<br>
<br>
Its very clear what the high end guilds are wanting and why.<br>
<br>
They want a zone free of training and kiting in the graveyards so that they can quest xp or whatever.<br>
<br>
Karadin said it in his posts.  Others have made it very clear that they dont want teaming... God forbid that a mid sized guild teams up and gets to content that the high end guilds have worked through there time sinks on.<br>
<br>
Fact is it doesnt matter what anyone says thats here on these boards as the guilds that have killed AD by themselves will decide this is a pointless conversation the only thing that its done is make me more sure of what the High end guilds are after.  And that would be remaining ahead of the pack anyway possible.<br>

I had asked in a post conserning this thread... it was basicly, who all has access to the RTA channel besides the Admins....<br>
<br>
What would happen if the 2 guilds that teamed up didn't have access to the channel, therefore could not ask if someone has reservations about guilds teaming?<br>
<br>
Just food for thought.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showPrevMessage?topicID=646.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showNextMessage?topicID=646.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.emailToFriend?topicID=646.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.threadControl?topicID=646.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=646.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=646.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm68">Current World Events<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm69">Elemental Planes</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50>General</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.239<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
