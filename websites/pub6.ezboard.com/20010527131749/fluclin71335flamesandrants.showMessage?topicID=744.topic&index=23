<br>
Are you a pally? What about raids being led by different people and groups? This is not a Reservation/Rotation list for the cleric epic, this is a reservation/rotation list for a MOB. Go check out the Calendar. It's very similar, but since we don't have an *exact* spawn time, this was the fairest way to do it. I suppose we could also reserve Ragefire on the Calendar. Guild A reserves Ragefire for the next month. Guild B reserves Ragefire for June. Guild C reserves Ragefire for July, etc etc<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;As it is now, the book is being reserved in all open raids now. Thus, like Troy, if your not in a big guild you will never get this book. Therefore it should be listed.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Um, you need to update your information. I don't think there are many *big guilds* that can even touch Naggy/Vox anymore. Ever heard of that nasty little thing where you get ported out of the zone at 53+? Your chances are actually greater to get the book if you're in a smaller guild. Heck, I always wanted to do Dragon Raids on merit. But, I outleveled em. You wanna lead a raid every week? Fine, you can keep track of who, on your raids, is next in line. But if you don't run the raid, tough titties.<br>

Ragefire is on a reservation/rotation list for a few reasons.<br>
1) Ever seen LoS and Apex race to see who could get to VS first? It's not pretty, and both were told to go away by GM Leycrow. Yes, he can make a MOB off limits.<br>
2) There is this thing in society that is generally considered polite, socially appropriate behavior. It is &quot;Wait your turn.&quot; When the person in front of you at the supermarket doesn't have their checkbook out, but all their items have already been scanned, does that mean you get to shove your way in front of them? Nope, sorry.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should stop bitching and get your ass on the list now, so 6 months down the line, the list isn't a year long wait. <br>

Level 50 is when you can start your epic, that was the context i meant it in. <br>

You are changing the style of play from a ffa to a listed system. It is very different. There is a major difference b/w waiting on my butt on a list and waiting at a camp. <br>

No I am not a paly, but I have friends who are and yes they realize that they can not get the book b/c it is being reserved on all open raids. Was a naggy raid recently where the CoF was reserved, open raids where all the loot is reserved is very messed up imo.<br>

You can take messages in any context and thus do this little number to anything you say. You realize what i mean. If you can not host a naggy raid, you can not get the book. <br>

Politeness, thats funny, b/c responses sure enough are not polite. My question is valid. Just b/c not everyone holds your viewpoint does not mean you can bash them. I<br>

There go all my lurid fantasies.<br>
<br>
You are trying to stir the pot, whether you admit it or not.  Did you post on boards other than LoS?  I don't know, and I'm not going to go searching; just seems to me that you picked what you thought was the group most likely to back your viewpoint.  I suppose there'll be an application there soon enough.<br>
<br>
Can you not see that dozens of people are working together on a goal here, a goal with which they're all in agreement?  Can you not see the lack of support you're getting?<br>
<br>
I'm not going to bash you for your small number of posts, and I'm not going to bash you because I've never heard of you.  But what I do take exception to is that, because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have to wait 4 months for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> your</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> epic, everybody else who has worked so hard to get on this list now has to suffer.  This is what you're trying to do, right?  By taking away the organized system we have in place, you stand a better chance of receiving your epic.  Screw the rest of the server, because you'll find yourself some high level help and get right on in there.  Sure, maybe 20 percent of the people on that list could get there before you, but that still gives you a much better shot at Ragefire.<br>
<br>
So, suggest something.  You're asking a group of people who have basically agreed to work together towards a pretty noble goal to come up with alternatives to suit you.  It doesn't work that way.  You want to see change, suggest something, because all I see you talking about is FFA, which is going to hurt far more people than it will help.</font><P><hr align="center" size="1">

I have tried not to flame and if I am coming off as wanting to hurt others, well I guess I would like it to be seen as I would like the same chance as everyone else. <br>
<br>
And yes I did suggest something. I tried multiple times to get the discussion moved toward revamping the list or some such so that it was not a deterent to clerics who are not on the list to attempt their epic. <br>
<br>
What is the opinion on having a 10 person max limit on the list? That way new people can get on the list. Yes you are not guaranteed to be able to get your epic. But you should not be guaranteed to get it. Thus every month say, or when list was exhausted a new list would be made off of new applicants for the list. Thus the most any one would have to wait to have a chance of getting on the list would be a month. <br>
<br>
What of a randoming of clerics who are able to complete the epic? Thus it is a fair chance for any cleric who is capable. If the community feels that level or start date should add a weighing to the random then fine, fix the random such that if you are level 60 you have a better chance then a level 50 but give that level 50 a chance. If you feel that Troy deserves more chance at the next epic then me, since he has waited so long, fine give him a off set to give him a better chance, but give me a chance. <br>
<br>
I think it is just sad the list is a deterent to doing your epic.<br>
