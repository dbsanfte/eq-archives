-----Now as for tindi in mischief.------<br>
IF tindi thought we were ksing their puppet why did they not say so? In case you didn't notice I repeated myself saying that I asked them why they were taking my camp.<br>
<br>
We had been in the puppet camp long enough to have already killed 5 puppets. I admit that we had recently arrived.<br>
<br>
BUT tindi did not complain in any way, they did not in any way say &quot;hey thats our camp, we are doing audience AND puppets&quot;.<br>
<br>
Also, I remember for a fact that *TWO SETS* of puppets were up at that time. Meaning that tindi had not killed the puppets for at least a hour and a half. Very hard to clame they owned the puppets camp with that in mind.<br>
<br>
But the point is they said nothing, they walked in and started hitting the puppets while we were currently engaging a different one. I know how things work in mischief and I know that THAT is called camp stealing.<br>
<br>
What happened afterwards with GEB may not have been announced in guild chat, it only takes 1 pissed off person to train geb to the maze. Could have been done without the agreement of other tindi. <br>
<br>
But it was *very* strange how every tindi in the zone ported/camped the instant the theater despawned. I did a who check seconds afterwards and it had gone from around 20 tindi in zone to 4 and then none. It looked very much like it had been planed imo.<br>
<br>
All tindi had to do was say &quot;please leave, we are killing audience and puppets as well..&quot;<br>
<br>
And we would have left to keep the peace. <p><font face="verdana" color="#99CCCC" size="2">

I've said it, ill say it again, I did NOT ninja loot the teeth. Bogarthamule *specifically* told me and several other level 60s to loot the teeth. Levlenna told me afterwards that ONLY she can call loot during her raids, and that I should not have done what bog told me to do. I hold Bog *completely* responsible for the entire misunderstanding. He btw is a &quot;senior&quot; member of vof.<br>

Thought you said that he told YOU specifically to loot a tooth. By your own words it doesn't appear to be the case.<br>

<br>
Trying REALLY hard to think back to that day....<br>
<br>
hmmmm....nope sorry Mak you're wrong.  I was DEAD after the kill and didn't get ressed for a while.  When I DID get resses I went straight into tells with Lev about awarding the teeth.  The BPs had already been awarded before I was ressed but only Maly and Lev had looted teeth so far.  It was a 30 minute corpse so there was really no rush, BUT Lev had to call them because they were loot that needed deciding.  I told her she needs to call them soon...and then she called the &quot;Grats Levlenna, Malystryx, Bogarthamule, Kroog, and Velocaa on teeth.&quot;  What's to our surprise they were all gone.  I find it odd that you looted them all.  Supposedly multiple people play your accounts but most every time your toons were on it was just you playing 4 or 5 toons at once.  Are you so uber that you think you can get those 4 or 5 toons VP keys and go own VP alone?  Either way it was pretty low of you to loot ALL the remaining teeth.  If you loot one, then fine...it was a spur of the moment decision and thought you could loot one...but ALL 3!?  Sorry, that's just greed.<br>
<br>
I am guessing your confusion is due to the fact that we had a discusion BEFORE the trak kill about who should get teeth.  I am sure I brought up then that lvl 60s would get first as the higher lvl the better for VP as all know.  You are seeming to confuse this with then.  Beyond that fact...even if I DID say those words...I HAVE been lvl 60 for about 8 months now, and am an officer of VoF...if I was calling ANY lvl 60 to loot the teeth then WHY wouldn't I have just gone up and looted one myself right then?<br>
<br>

What this post should be called is: &quot;House Calenture, Here is the truth..&quot; because we've said it time and time again.. Makmut buys accounts from eBay.<br>
<br>
  By far the most interesting thing about this whole HC crap is this.  Datalore posts a warning about them, giving The Rathe community a heads up about them.  Some of them reply, but don't acknowledge everyone pointing fingers at them being eBayed.  Then, the too overdone Datalore toilet paper image.  Pat yourselves on the back, HC.  But lets not forget on that thread you ignored people questioning your intimate relationship with the PURCHASE button on eBay.<br>
<br>
  Last but not least we have this thread.  It's mind numbingly stupid for you to go and post about a guild that has been established (and well maintained) much longer than yours.  Yet, you're a glutton for punishment and try to point fingers at Tindi` Losi for your own misfortunes.  Get a clue, people know you're eBayed and that drastically reduces your status in their eyes.  Why? Because eBay is the easy way out.<br>
<br>
  You want to point fingers but you won't admit the truth or the real questions being pressed in your face.  Until you decide to admit the truth, I suggest you stop trying to knock on Tindi`s door for alleged wrong-doings, or any other guilds for that matter.  Don't be bitter because you thought buying level 60s off eBay would get you into BotS, SoT, NB, or Tindi.  And since you couldn't, you had to buy more accounts to start your own guild.  Good Job! Fricken idiot.<br>
<br>
  And I agree with Kagato 100% about the person in POM that always c2's him and how cool that person is.  I didn't know Makmut bought an enchanter?  Oh no.. wait, wait.. we're talking about someone cool and that'd be me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  yw Kag! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p><p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0" BGCOLOR="Orange" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#000000" BORDERCOLORDARK="#000000"><TR><TD><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="3" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="0" BGCOLOR="Orange" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="Orange" BORDERCOLORDARK="Orange"><TR><TD><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="top"><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mejara</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000"><BR><I>Midnight Fantasy</I><BR>Enchanter <I><B>~</B></I> The Rathe</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="3" BGCOLOR="yellow" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#000000" BORDERCOLORDARK="#000000"><TR><TD><FONT size="-1"><A STYLE="color:red;text-decoration:none;cursor:crosshair;" HREF="mailto:Mejara@scribble.nu">email</A></FONT></TD><TD><FONT size="-1"><a STYLE="color:red;text-decoration:none;font-style:none;cursor:crosshair;font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;" href="http://www.tindilosi.com/" target="_top">Tindi'Losi</A></FONT></TD><TD><FONT size="-1"><A STYLE="color:red;text-decoration:none;cursor:crosshair;" HREF="http://64.174.12.218/tindilosi/deleteme.php?test=Mejara" target="profile">profile</A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umakmutdenstore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>makmut denstore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/15/01 9:17:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=288.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tindi`losi, Here is the truth..</span><hr size=1> Datalore did not post a damn &quot;heads up&quot;<br>
<br>
He posted a bunch of lies, lies which now a great many people who did not witness the event -believe. <br>
<br>
Problem is, to lie he would need a motive. If you look at his post you can see his motive in his own post. He doesnt like a few of our members. And he doesnt like the fact that we were recruiting. He also didnt like how successful we were in mischief. And that, to him, is reason enough to post a tun of lies. And HC being a very new guild, he knew what would happen.<br>
<br>
And I really wish some of the tindi who were present would be willing to come up here, and post the truth..<br>
<br>
..the truth that tindi never asked us to leave the puppets area. Never in any way clamed the camp was theirs, never even spoke a word. <br>
<br>
..the truth that someone in tindi did train geb to the maze to despawn theater.<br>
<br>
I also find it intresting that while datalore is very quick to point the finger at us, *he* has YET to deny *any* of the things I said he did.<br>
<br>
-------apps..<br>
/sigh<br>
As for the bots/sot/nb/tindi/RF and what not other guild(s) applications, that was jonas. maks rl classmate fukwit who noone likes one bit. he has no access to mak at all. who the flying hell would apply to join 5+ guilds at once? I mean sht, you can only join one. He did some other sht too that I can't go into. besides that I am limited in what I can say. Mak has never been ebayed, or &quot;traded&quot;. If your really that intrested, talk to fanno. Maybe he can help ya -rl friend. Or maybe Xabitz on UK server. If your actually that intrested.<br>
<br>
Here is my ebay id, I've used ebay a few times..<br>

<br>
If you actually were willing to waste that much of your time, Id probably do it! lol. Well I guess it isnt a waste of time. Anyone who extends the hand of friendship to me I gladly accept.<br>

Id be friends with datalore even, if he would post a appology. =p <p><font face="verdana" color="#99CCCC" size="2">

And yes, he posted a &quot;heads up&quot;.  You prove this every time you sit down and reply.  Also, it's not that he personally doesn't like a couple of your members, a large portion of the community dislikes them because of the way they would go into fear late at night and were scumbags.  That, as a guild leader, should bother you and you should get some history on your members.  But you probably don't care about that.<br>
<br>
  Seems the only thing you care about is the hard-on you get from seeing 25+ people from lvl. 56-60 wearing a House Calenture tag.  Don't deny it, I know you get one, you have so many friggen screen shots of the /w all &quot;House Calenture&quot; list.  Which pales to /w all SoT, NB, BotS and Tindi, btw.  Or maybe it's clearing &quot;uber&quot; zones like Sirens Grotto, PoM, and Greater Faydark that tickles your fancy.<br>
<br>
  I wouldn't hope for an apology, you could wish for one.  I suggest you hold your breath, and not because I want you to go unconcious, but because I sincerely doubt you'll get one.<br>
<br>
  You can keep squawking about Tindi' pulling Geb and kill stealing your mobs, but you have no factual evidence.  It's just your word against Tindi's.  Give me some proof other than &quot;I know&quot; and then you'll have something to argue about. <p><p><p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0" BGCOLOR="Orange" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#000000" BORDERCOLORDARK="#000000"><TR><TD><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="3" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="0" BGCOLOR="Orange" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="Orange" BORDERCOLORDARK="Orange"><TR><TD><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="top"><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mejara</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#000000"><BR><I>Midnight Fantasy</I><BR>Enchanter <I><B>~</B></I> The Rathe</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="3" BGCOLOR="yellow" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#000000" BORDERCOLORDARK="#000000"><TR><TD><FONT size="-1"><A STYLE="color:red;text-decoration:none;cursor:crosshair;" HREF="mailto:Mejara@scribble.nu">email</A></FONT></TD><TD><FONT size="-1"><a STYLE="color:red;text-decoration:none;font-style:none;cursor:crosshair;font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;" href="http://www.tindilosi.com/" target="_top">Tindi'Losi</A></FONT></TD><TD><FONT size="-1"><A STYLE="color:red;text-decoration:none;cursor:crosshair;" HREF="http://64.174.12.218/tindilosi/deleteme.php?test=Mejara" target="profile">profile</A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umakmutdenstore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>makmut denstore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/15/01 10:59:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=288.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tindi`losi, Here is the truth..</span><hr size=1> god, mejara..<br>

It's only fair. As for the rest, or not having time to read it all... ya certainly have time to read all the other stuff about you, and reply to it again, and again... and again. <br>
/shrug<br>
oh well, I consider my questions answered, from this point out. I'd just like to take this moment to thank all of the members of SoT, BotS, NB, etc. for bein cool, and sticking up for the guild and people I love, even though you didn't have to. We've had our guild differences in the past, but when you saw something like this, you didn't hop on a bandwagon, you had the integrity to say &quot;This is wrong&quot; instead of any of the other things you could have said. It takes a big man (or woman) to do something like that, and I respect you for it.<br>
Mej, you crack me up, kiddo :p  Keep it up, k?<br>
Makmut? There really isn't much to say that I haven't already said, other than this: My questions have been answered by you, and you didn't even have to type a word about them. I think I'm done talking to you for now. <br>
Hope you can sleep well at night. I know I can. <p><font size=-1><i>"Jesus saves, the rest of you take full damage."</i></font>
