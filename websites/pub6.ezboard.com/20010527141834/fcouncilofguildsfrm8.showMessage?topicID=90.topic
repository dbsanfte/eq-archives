CoG Raid Victorious</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Last night, the CoG held a Vox raid, led by the members of the Sacred Band alliance and myself. We had good attendance, with 52 attendees in all, most of who were on the sign up board. I only had to add one latecomer as an insurance policy, a wizard (ended up with only 2 to start, so added a 3rd before the final rush). We took a little longer with groups than I would have liked, but moved in about 1 hour and 15 minutes into it (about 15 minutes late). I must say we need to be a little better about being there on time and being bound near there, but overall, our raiders were punctual. <br>
<br>
My management body consisted of me, raid commander, Cassia, backup commander and buffing line coordinator, Lothax, loot coordinator and attendance taker, Dogedme, attendance taker, Belce back up commander and secondary assist, Rbecka, main assist and puller, and Muji, feign death puller and stunt crash test dummy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  These guys did an awesome job! Also thanks to my group leaders, Rbecka, Zeol, Luolana, Eressia, Draeven, Cassia, Lothax, Baptismo, Flarren and Dogedme, who all did quite well at keeping me informed. We moved quickly through the dungeon to the  king room, bound, buffed a little and began killing ice giants. We were a bit unruly at first, not pulling the ice giants back to a spot where we could fight them effectively, but soon had the gate clear and set up for pulls from around the lair. Rbecka started pulling from the north hallway, and did a fine job of clearing the hallway. Flarren made a good suggestion at this point, which we'll use again. We formed a U shape around this tunnel and let the puller come into the center of the room with the mob, then close ranks around it, to keep the giants from warping through walls. <br>
<br>
Once the hallway was clear to the ramp, I sent Muji the monk in to began FD pulling to clear the lair. Though inexperienced, he jumped at the task and moved in. However, on his first pull, an icy terror gave him the business end of a force blast, which drove him into a pit and down into the tunnels below Vox's lair. I believe that this caused a train to form, which actually ended up helping us. Before we knew it, we had 6 ice giants on us (and we were unprepared). Here I must point out that though discipline slipped a bit, we accomplished some an AMAZING feat. Of the 6, 2 were priests, 1 was a magus, 1 was a priest of Nagafen and there were 3 regular ice giants. We fought long and hard, charming some of the priests to help our cause, and in the end we triumphed with only 1 death. There was some early confusion about what mob to hit, and confusion about some charmed mobs, but we recovered and killed them all, an outstanding job. <br>
<br>
At this point I began trying to talk Muji in. He was unfamiliar with the pit area, but remained patient, making his way slowly back up to Vox's lair. As he was coming up, I looked into the hallway outside the lair and saw that Vox was stuck in the doorway. The last 3 guilds that failed on Vox had failed because she became stuck in the doorway, and no one could hit her or cast on her. I became immediately worried and petitioned for her to be moved back to her spot. This petition was never answered. Meanwhile, Muji had made it up to the boulder and Feigned, at which point he was right under Vox, so he camped to clear aggro. Vox was still stuck in the doorway however. When he came back, he got to the camp and I hit upon an idea to get her out of the doorway. <br>
<br>
I had Muji walk up to her and target and hit her once, then FD immediately, with instructions to camp out if necessary. This is akin to asking him to go up and box her on the nose and see if she kills him, but he never even blinked. That's the kind of self-sacrifice I love to see on these raids. As soon as he touched her, she aggroed not only him, but all of us. The signs of AE fear popped up all around us (scaring the mess out of those first-timer dragon raid attendees). I immediately had us camp out to clear the aggro. When we returned, Muji made it safely back, and I checked the doorway. To my joyous surprise, the beast had returned to her lair, paving the way for our assault. <br>
<br>
We moved up and quickly began the buffing line, run quite ably by Cassia. We buffed quickly, and I used our main tank group as guards over the buff line, saving their buffs until last so that we could handle any Ice Giant respawns. This was a good idea, as we had a couple, one of which managed to summon and kill Belce. We got him ressed and got camped out, made it to the chat room and waited. When Cassia finally gave us the all clear, we moved in and took up positions on the ramp, raring to go. With a shout of &quot;1 2 3 GO GO GO&quot; I sent the raiders in, charging madly along. <br>
<br>
Having instructed the tanks not to attack her until they were on her pedastel, we started out well enough, drawing Vox back to the middle of her lair to avoid her getting stuck in walls. But as the fight progressed, she moved closer and closer to the door, and sometime after sending in the casters, she took up her permanent place near the door and began striking through the wall at our healing line. On this raid, we managed to get 6 bards, and did they ever make the difference! For my own experience, having the bard magic and cold resist songs playing made me almost un fearable. I only got feared for a length of about 4 seconds once, the rest were negligible. I'm not sure how much damage her breath weapon did though. I only went back for heals one time, and was quickly and efficiently healed. Heading back in, I realized she was close to going down, and was reaching through the wall to attack our healers. Since I could still hit her, I shouted for no one to back off, to make sure we stayed on her, and watched her hit points go farther and farther down. Suddenly I realized I was at 1 bubble of health again and ran back for a heal. The doorway was so clogged, I finally gave up and decided to just stay on her, whether I died or not. I kept slashing and poking away, and just as I died to her last breath attack, I saw her health bar with no visible red. Popping back up in Qeynos, I got the report that she had died! WOOOOOT!<br>
<br>
My first of 3 linkdeaths occured then, right as I zoned out of Qeynos. Upon returning to the game, I found myself in Qeynos Hills, somewhere above it, at about the level of Plane of Sky apparently. Hoping a camp out would help, I did so, then returned to find myself in the same place. I began to look all around, as all I could see was gray (had the sky turned off). Suddenly below me the ground appeared and rose to meet me.... BAM! You have fallen for 10000 points of damage, Loading... Please Wait... AAAAAAAGHHHHH!!<br>
<br>
One tip for those this happens to... type /report immediately or you will never get a res from a GM. I didn't, and had a friend petition for me, as my previous petition was somehow still in the Queue (but still unanswered... go figure). Thank you Verant... /rude Verant Customer Service.<br>
<br>
Upon being ressed, I got my corpse and began the long corpse recovery. We got the paladins ressed first (so they could roll on the book of scale), and had 5 or 6 bodies in the pit. I sent Dogedme to the pit to get bodies, and he was overwhelmed when his invis wore off. I then sent Guppin, who managed to get a few corpses before going LD (from which he never returned). Dogedme returned to the corpse recovery and eventually got everyone out. At this point, most people were patient. We still had a few who tried to rush us into lottoing for things, and I have to tell you, this is uncalled for. I have to work in the mornings too, there are other people there who have to work or go to school, and they were patient and never bothered me. One person gave me no less than 10 tells about one item. Be patient, sit down, and be quiet or log off and don't get any rolls. Simple as that. It's rude, it only seeks to slow down the corpse recovery, which slows down the process of rolling. There were somewhere in the neighborhood of 15-20 bodies to either res or pull from the pit, and you are no more important than any of those people just because you have to work, I only got 3 hours of sleep myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Nuff said. <br>
<br>
Our loot was an outstanding bonanza. The Lady Vox apparently has been eating a lot of bards lately, as shown by her abundance of bard horns. The loot and winners were:<br>
<br>
2 Horns of McVaxius - Auldiwen and Damanya (both first timers)<br>
Runed Bolster Belt - Rbecka (who lottoed off her thin banded belt right after this - good sign of generosity)<br>
Staff of Forbidden Rites - Brisos (First time raider)<br>
Torbin's Eyepatch - Hikmer (Who had a pucker moment, waiting through all the groups rolls with the highest first roll)<br>
Half of the Book of Scale - Kommisar<br>

All in all, a great raiding party, lots of discipline showed itself in the end fight. We took about 4 1/2 hours on this one, which is a damn sight better than our last Vox raid. I want to thank Ogun who came into the dungeon and gave us Res stick service, speeding us along greatly in corpse recovery and resses. We had a good number of clerics (4), bards (6), and enchanters (3), though we were a little short on high level heals. However, it didn't seem to impact us in the fight, not that I could tell. <br>
<br>
We should all be very proud of this raid, as we are on a winning streak of 3 straight dragons! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We OWNED Vox! I've got some good ideas to speed up the raid for next time. Once again, thanks to all those who came and gave their all! <br>

Thanks so much for the timely recap :)  Sounds like you had a solid run into Vox and triumphed where others had failed.<br>
<br>
Oh man - Damanya - Auldi - INCREDIBLE WINS for both of you, I can't think of 2 other people more capable of wielding those horns.<br>

<br>
I have a question about the bear pits.  I checked and I noticed they were only level 47.  On future runs, would it be plausible to send 2-3 groups comprised of the highest level raiders down there and wipe them out to speed up corpse recovery?  I figure if 3 groups can take out level 51 giants in a little under a minute - they can certainly do level 47 bears.<br>
<br>
Just a thought.<br>

You have to make sure you have enough bodies in the lair to guard the resses and recently ressed. We'll look at trying that on the next run.<br>

had another thought.<br>
<br>
Those 15-20 people that fell in the pits...Were they lev'd or DMF'd?  Did levitate get dispelled for them and if so, was that the cause of their deaths?<br>
<br>
The only reason I ask is because Kataina handed me a ring the other day and to when I went to check it I discovered it was a summoned ring of levitation (5 charges of levitate I think).  Instead of casting DMF or levitate on future battles - hand these rings out and encourage everyone to refresh levitate if it's ever dispelled.<br>

CoG Raid Victorious</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I saw there were a few Mages there, so Im just curious as to your experience casting on Vox. When I did Naggy with CoG, I was 49th, and none of my nukes landed. This time for Vox, I was 52nd, and again, none of my nukes landed (lava bolt, shock of swords, malosi) after multiple tries. Im pretty sure I was in range, as I was trying to get as close as possible. Perhaps I wasn't though, one can never tell with all that lag. Maybe next time (if there is a next time) Ill take a swing or two to make sure Im in range.<br>
<br>
Once I was at around 50 mana, and nothing landing, I decided to run out to the healing line and started dropping mod rods. It was near the end of the battle though, so I dont know how much use that actually was. My pet lasted until the end though, so he at least was doing damage. Go pet.<br>
<br>
As for the bear pits, being the bright Mage that I am, I ended up in one *after* Vox was dead. There were still small battles going on, and my pet was helping in one of them. I was running to it to make sure he didn't wander off and cause mischeif, and I went left when I should have went right. By the time I realized I was slowly floating down a hole, it was too late.<br>
<br>
One question on the bears, are they conisdered animals? Are there usually icy terrors in the bear pits? Im curious, because I realized after the fact (again, smart me) that I had my earthen boots on, which when activated, produce a nice, instant cast invis vs. animals. If they are infact considered animals, Mages would do well to hotkey their boots if they have them, and hit it the instant they find themselves falling through.<br>

<br>
I've been on 2 Vox raids and one Naggy raid with CoG, and we're 3 for 3 when I'm along! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Amazingly I didn't die this time.  Having a bard pump my CR up to almost 200 probably didn't hurt!  So not only was I able to keep fighting and do a more damage (as well as chain cast stun between whacks), I got to see a dragon DIE this time, not just see it's body afterwards... I love it!  This was definitely one of the better raids I've been on, thanks everyone.<br>
<br>
As for falling in pits, I got feared twice, and with DMF on and my screen &quot;aimed&quot; at dead level (I hit the 'home' button before going in) I didn't fall into the pits, but lingered above them until I could return and start whacking the big lizard once more.  The last Vox raid my screen was &quot;aimed&quot; slightly downward which caused me to run down one of the pits before the fear wore off, despite DMF still being on.<br>
So, from my experience, while fear makes you run at a constant speed and controls the horizontal path, it doesn't control your verticle direction (ie, you will still &quot;dive&quot; at the ground if you are aimed that way when feared, but won't if you aren't).  Definitely something I'll keep in mind in the future.<br>
<br>
Also of note: the polar bears and wolves in the pits are probably considered animals, but the spiders are most likely not...  so Invis vs. Animals might postpone death, I don't know that it would actually make getting out of the pit alive possible. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

<font size=2>An Alliance is...."in interguild relations, a formal agreement between two or more guilds for mutual support in case of war. An alliance provides for combined action on the part of two or more independent states and is usually defensive in form, since it obligates allies to join forces if one or more of them is attacked by another guild. Alliances are typically defined by a treaty, the most critical clauses of which are those that define the casus foederis, or the circumstances under which an ally becomes obligated to aid a fellow ally..."

<br>
I would like to thank Haemish and his commanders.  They did a GREAT job leading this raid.  Information was timely and accurate, enabling us to move quickly thru Permafrost to slay Vox.  This was my first dragon raid, and I'm eager to go again.  Thank you for making this a fun and memorable experience.<br>
<br>
Haemish - please give my re-agent funds to Cassia (my costs were minimal using Rune III @ ~8g each; Cassia was using Rune IV @ ~11p each)<br>
<br>
Note on sub-49 Enchanters: We cannot charm the Ice Giants (I tried almost every one, and their level was too high for my best charm spell).  During the IG fights, the sub-49 Enchanters would be better served casting Rune on those in need (especially the charming enchanters), and Augmenting everyone as possible between battles...throw Clarity around as well.  <br>
<br>
Thanks...<br>
Cassia for your invaluable advice during the raid.<br>
Lenenae for the resurrection that got level 44 back.<br>
Ailwen for the ride home.<br>
<br>
We shall dance again soon, my friends.<br>

So much so that I would advise against messing with attacking the place. It's quite large, with a large number of mobs tucked away in various corners, most of them in groups of 3 to 5. Yes, it could be done, probably easily depending on the spawn times, but all the corpses can be retrieved in far less time, even if there are a couple dozen. Last night took a bit longer because niether Guppin nor I had ever even seen the pits, much less explored them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Spells wise on Vox, when we were called in I ran and stood underneath her staring at her belly. at 51 I got off 3 bolts (thank you tanks for understanding what I meant and moving to the sides when I said &quot;LOS spell!!!&quot;) so I put almost 2500 dmg into her soft underside. Yes I remember at 49 doing absolutely no dmg to her no matter what, no idea why. It was only when she went up the wall that I couldn't get close enough to hit her... and thats also when she decided I had done her too much dmg and summoned me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

There was alot of lagg for those of us on slower comps n stuff and the only complaint I had was the people would CONSTANTLY emoted stuff, either spamming the same thing or having a hotkey with like 5 different emotes on it. You wanna miss commands? thats the fastest way for it to happen. If you wanna dance or as I saw - <br>
<br>
soandso points at %T<br>
soandso roars at %T<br>
soandso screams a battle challenge at %T<br>
soandso thinks %T is going down!<br>
soandso gives a rude gesture to %T<br>
<br>
 - then do it somewhewre else, and yes that was 1 hotkey linked to his Assist button. It was not needed, not called for and did nothing but make the rest of us have to scroll back. If you so desperately have to hug someone that you JUST CANT STAND IT ANY MORE (appologies for caps) then fer pete sake just do it once! if every person said hello to every one of their friends and all they did was wave at each one and say half the people there knew half the others do you not realize that if everyone did it within about a 10 second span that command to &quot;CAMP&quot; would have scrolled off the top of your scroll bar.<br>
<br>
ps. yes my biggest pet peeve is being in the middle of emote spammers, especially the hotkey emote spammers GRRRR<br>
