There were alts that would have used the items. By your own admission, he was not raiding as a recruit or even a potential recruit, and therefore I don't see any reason for him to have even been on the raids, much less getting loot preference over the alts of contributing members.<br>

I read the post you linked but I object to the term of &quot;superstar&quot; being identified by &quot;that&quot; one player.  1 person can't single handedly do much in PoP, it takes a grp.  Everything is pretty much grp/raid encounter to get further in the game and to single handedly say, &quot;we would never had done this had we not have Generic_tank_01 here.&quot;  He made suggestions on how to improve the game....thru whining, not commenting to SoE.  His ranting and raving are like that of my son when he doesn't get his way.  I have to sit him down and tell him to slow down and discuss why he doesn't get what he want's all the time.  Listening to his arguement in a calm voice and rationalizing.  <br>
<br>
Now his Insepid rantin has become the butt of all jokes it seems, where people are cheering for him to jump off the bridge and finally shut up.  Hey Ssar, if your so high and mighty on them...as you've posted on the monkly site, do a transfer to there server, join there guild, and delete yourself.<br>

<br>
No, it’s hard to get PoP flags when all you do is log on, whine about not having groups handed to you, and then log.  We stopped doing Dozekar the Cursed 1/29/03, and passed two of our last three times before that (on a 6-7 guild rotation, you do the math BQ).  Dozekar hasn’t been a focus of this guild for a long, long time.  VP?  We didn’t go to VP from the time PoP released until Feb 2003, and even when we do go now, it’s what, 2 hours time when we have low numbers?  That’s hardly keeping the whining BQ away from his PoP flags.  You were focused on whining, we were focused on moving ahead.  It’s easy to see why you didn’t work out.<br>

No, he was a recruit.  It was shortly after that raid, that it was decided it would be best for him to part ways.  As you may or may not remember, in NB, mains, invites, alts is the loot order.  And again, you were a mage, who couldn’t use a single item he was awarded, WTF is your problem?<br>

The first time NB attempted Behemoth, did you or did you not try to stir up interest in a VP raid for the purpose of getting rare Kunark spells to trade for 65 spells from BotS, and only agree to attempt Behemoth (which would have given us direct access to these 65 spells) when it was clear there <br>
was great pressure to do so? I'm rather boggled at what makes you label this &quot;moving ahead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bogfather was tagged in another guild during the Ntov raid (and was purported to have been bragging to them about all the loot he was getting). Are you saying that he was raiding with NB, as a recruit and going through the recruiting process, while a member of another guild? It seems to me that either 1) He wasn't a recruit, or 2) If he was a recruit, it was very hypocritical for you to allow that while he was in another guild, since NB always rips someone a new asshole whenever they leave for any reason other than quitting.<br>
<br>
[quote] Your comment said He talks too much. It didn’t say He talks too <br>
much on <br>
public boards. [/quote] <br>
<br>
Please forgive me for not being more clear. I don't care <br>
what he says on his on guilds boards, or in /gu. My annoyance comes from the fact that he visits EVERY POPULAR EQ BOARD KNOWN TO MAN, and that his posts <br>
at said boards lack any meaningful content. When he scolded someone for posting a topic where they &quot;have no clue what they are talking about,&quot; I found it greatly amusing, since you would be hard pressed to find someone who engages in this very activity more than Bogfather.<br>
<br>
My comment to Thaldin was meant to be taken with as much seriousness as his comments toward me. If he is going to post insults with such a murky base in <br>
fact, do you expect him to get better in return? I don't know how you can say Thaldin had nothing to do with Vince being /gr'd, when he openly and proudly admitted on the boards the next day that he was the one who pushed <br>
for it in &quot;officer chat&quot; (When at the time, 95% of the guild had no clue that there was an officer chat channel, or even who these officers were). However, I am not meaning to imply that Thaldin is power hungry with any greater degree of seriousness than when Thaldin implied that I derived <br>
sexual pleasure from humping couches. Both are spiteful comments with a murky base in fact-- if he is going to  such insults, he can expect them in return.<br>

No.  When asked if we could do Behemoth and not having anywhere near the requisite enchanters, I did, in fact, offer the alternative of a VP raid and outlined its benefits given our reduced numbers that Sunday.  No subsequent Behemoth raid happened that day, nor for a few weeks after, when suddenly, our enchanter contingent was online together and we tried a spur of the moment Behemoth raid.

He came to three N ToV raids with us, the first time as a member of another guild, and he got all of one item.  He then came to the next two, including his famous third one where he died &quot;too much&quot; in several guildies' opinion, and that was the raid during which he got several rots (not all I'd remind you).  He had an open, posted application on the board, he was a recruit, and was not a member of any other guild.  Care to spew any more info you obviously don't have the slightest clue about?  The only hypocrisy here, is you accusing Bog of not knowing what he's talking about - and then watching you dig your hole deeper.<br>

Again, you're bitter about a game you don't play, that a recruit you didn't like, got loot you couldn't use.  It's time to stop being bitter, and get over it.<br>

There was in fact a Behemoth attempt that day, and judging between a conversation log which I saw between you and Unikron, you were not very happy about that fact.<br>

I can't really comment on Bogfather other than to say that I never saw an application of his on our boards, and that you told me he was not raiding as a recruit.<br>

BQ did not claim that Thaldin /gr'd Vince. He claimed that he instigated it. Which Thaldin openly admitted-- I was there that night, and I remember the post on the board the next day.<br>
<br>
The meaning of BQ's last paragraph is perfectly clear to me- he is saying that his claim that Thaldin likes to go on power trips and /GR people, has as much base in fact as Thaldin claiming that BQ likes to hump couches.<br>

<br>
Two different raids, two different days.  And my conversation with Unikron was not in reference to advancing in PoP or doing Behemoth.  It was in reference to people who were after their own advancement at the expense of others.  You remember the ones - got their PoJ trials done in one day and headed off to PoV never to be seen in PoJ again until well after they got 65, and realized they needed the rest of the guild to get their other flags.  Or who disappeared into HoH to get their AAs after we got them their AD flags.<br>

<br>
He posted an application between his first and second N ToV raids with us.  He was raiding as a recruit.  Again, three different N ToV raids there.  Which one did you ask me about?  During the first, no he wasn't a recruit.  By the thid, he was, and it was decided then, that he wasn't a good match because too many people had a beef with him (some with his chattiness, some with his &quot;dying too much&quot;).<br>

<br>
Yes, Thaldin tried to claim responsibilty for Vince's /gr, as the frequent disagreements between Vince and I were well-known and he wanted to take the heat off me for it, lest it be seen as me being out to get Vince.  However, the decision was mine alone, and was not &quot;instigated&quot; by anyone.  And while at least you were at the XTC raid in question, you weren't in officer chat to know what was or was not said by Raifin, Thaldin, Milambus or myself.  Again, BQ posting crap he wasn't there for and knew nothing about short of what he read about on the boards.<br>

You sure that wasn't the PoG/Tunare raid he got a good bit of kit from us while in WK?
