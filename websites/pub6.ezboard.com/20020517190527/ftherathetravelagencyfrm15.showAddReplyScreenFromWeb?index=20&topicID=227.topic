So I will go all out on it.<br>
<br>
This was posted by three people. Basherz, Pikin and Tuleden all &quot;friends&quot; and all Ex-LoM members.<br>
<br>
Basherz left LoM because Me and Sugarr convinced the group that Zoal needed the ancient seahorse hide cloak (zoal had bronze cloak and basherz had something much better) So he called Sugarr a bitch and left the guild and supposedly quit EQ. He's come by the LoM board and Tried to flame us by saying He got a girlfriend and he got his life back yada yada. <br>
So that did it for basherz.<br>
<br>
Pikin was a LoM rogue applicant, one night we did our rogue epics, and we let pikin get the quill from the general. The next day Pikin left the guild, and he complained about how he didn't like Tuleden thats why he left LoM (BAHAH see its funny because they are all friends, like the dipshits they are they tried to use LoM to get their epics.) Well congrats Pikin you used LoM to achieve your goals, I just hope you don't plan on joining a respectable guild ever again you greedy bitz.<br>
<br>
Tuleden, This guy was a card i mean really he did so much for LoM, if begging for your epic was an olympic sport then this guy would be a gold medal winner till the end of time. Instead of making himself useful by grouping or maybe even going on raids (Oh yah he did go on raids after I had to say hey tuleden you wanna come to this raid? I got kinna sick of that)<br>
I mean it was a day in day out thing &quot;Hey Guys VS remains are up want to come help me kill him.&quot; (we eventually did) then it was constantly asking the guild what group you needed to kill reavers. Then how about this, LoM on friday kills Dracolich this was a big thing for us and what did tuleden say the next day? &quot;Damn after I left the CoM raid to go to fear 4 jade reavers dropped.&quot; Yeah right @#%$ well anyways. I at one point kicked Tuleden out of the guild and he straight up begged me to get back in. I told him if he could not use the word EPIC for 2 weeks then sure he could get back in. Well it worked he never said EPIC in guild chat, but he did send em a tell everyday saying &quot;IF this mob is up is it ok If i ask for help?&quot; My constantly saying No didn't help any. So eventually he just pushed me too far so I kicked his ass out because it was aparant he didn't give a @#%$ about LoM. well he re-applied and then the next day he put this exact flame on our board. Cute aint it?<br>
<br>
Ok now that thats done let me do Justice to my comrads<br>
<br>
Penvaren - Uh one loser who has no life? <br>
Pen is married to a wonderful lady, and spends some time online to be with his guild (notice people like to be with their guild not just use them for their epic.) Pen and I had a fight one time when I said something really bad and I deserved his eternal hatred pretty much, but what does pen do? He forgives me the very next day and says its alright he knew i didn't mean it. That is a great guy if you ask me. <br>
<br>
Solarees - Another one of us who has no life eh? His shitty n00b paly? That is 8 levels higher then you and had to do it all with the Hybrid experience penelty, oh and not to mention his level 57 Enchanter? Wow I think I would take a level 57 ench and a level 60 paly any day over a level 51 war who did nothing but bitch about loot, a level 51 rogue who stole his epic, and a level 52 druid who only begged for his epic and didnt give a @#%$ about his guild. Sol doesn't have a life? I tend to think he does since he seems pretty highly educated to me, Yah tule there's this thing that people do its called go to school, and that is a big part of life, and thats something me sol and so many others do. Yah Yah i know school is stupid right, why spend your time in class learning how to do things when you can be huddled around the bong all day long &quot;Hey pass that @#%$ dude i dropped out of 7th grade hahaha&quot; Oh and sol should get a prostitue? I'm sorry tuleden some of us are able to get laid without having to gain access to your mother and sister and *shiver* your father too. No reason for someone to quit EQ if they have fun playing it. <br>
&quot;Don't worry dude there are no goblins in town I guarantee it.&quot; <br>
Yeah but I bet you got plenty of goblins up in your house from all that acid you've been dropping right? <br>
Listen you numbnut sack of @#%$, Sol is a great guy he's got some life experience he's got himself a great gal and thats 3 things you don't have.<br>
<br>
Aanilya - &quot;She's got 6 level 60's safe to say she has no life&quot; Erm that or the fact that she just knows how to get experience. You see tuleden &quot;Hey guy help me get my epic&quot; does not equal You gain experience!. Aan is another one of my great members, she livens up guild chat and she always says Hi to people when they log on to make them feel welcome, she also gets that weird thing that us intalargent (spelling it so you can read it bros) Edumacation, No life? try bright future and i'm sure she'll make some guy very happy in the future. I'm sure you three are just jealous once again of Aan, lets see she has 3 toons and all three are a higher level then all 3 of you, thats funny damn you guys suck.<br>
<br>
Sugarr - Oh now you straight up did the wrong thing by calling Sugarr a bitch. Let's see who was one of the people who let you in the guild when you were below the level limit, who was one of the guilds main druids who STILL doesn't have her epic because she wants everyone else to be happy and get theirs before she gets hers so noone will be jealous. Who makes everyone a lot happier when she's online then you ever could. Sugarr does, and don't you @#%$ forget it you piece of @#%$. Another case of jealousy just knowing that sugarr is 10000X the druid you are or ever could be, and that people actually like her and offer to help her with her epic, when they do @#%$ for you. Sugarr ownz yer ass and Sugarr is the best damn druid around. So @#%$ off<br>
Don't listen to em Sug yer no bitch =)<br>
<br>
Xedd - Well what can I say it comes down to me, My favorite topic. I play 24 hours a day? Ok I'll vouch for that one, I mean just last night I played from 6pm - 1 am  lets see 6..7..8..9..10..11..12..1 yup 24 hours, shows ya'lls high intelekt and edumacation once again. Unforgiving, Ummm lets see I gave you like 3 chances tuleden, Pikin I gave you a 2nd chance but you didn't want one you were just a lying sack of @#%$, and Basherz you acted like you were my friend to get epic help and yet I still forgive you for it. but you know what I can't forgive Idiocy so therefore I have no remorse for anything that happens to you three. I'm sure words can explain how totally @#%$ up I am, ya'lls 3rd grade education just can't use them yet. I am also sure a lot of people will think i'm a &quot;jag&quot;, but you know what I don't care assault me all you want just don't assault my guild members. <br>
<br>
Lastly some advice for my 3 amigos Tuleden Pikin and Basherz,<br>
Don't get a girlfriend please, or if you do make sure she gets herself fixed because I would hate it if you guys procreated (that means have children sorry didn't mean to use a big word.) Don't quit EQ because then you will realize that you really don't have a life, that all you do is drop acid and hit the bong all day, at least in EQ you exist. <br>
My final piece of advice, make new characters change your names and level to 50, then apply for LoM again so you can get yourselves some rolemodels because, LoM are some of the best people you will find anywhere.<br>
<br>
Later,<br>
Xedd &quot;THE UNFORGIVING!&quot; Zerous <br>
