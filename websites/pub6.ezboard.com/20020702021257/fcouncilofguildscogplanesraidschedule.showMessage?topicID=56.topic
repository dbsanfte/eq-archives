Aren't you a member in a guild that just had Fear or were allied in a fear raid a couple days ago?  This is a clear violation of KGC rules and should be cause for this group to lose their rotation.

Eternal Wrath and Allied Giants came to help us with a 5 HRS CORPSE RECOVERY, so if he and a couple Allied Giants and a couple Valoran's, and..etc hadn't been with us we would have been anihilated so grow up.

<br>
If I'm not mistaken, reports I got from the groups attacking fear last night was that the initial break-in was ok, but when everyone got to the camp spot, the entire group was annihilated by a large train/pull. Unable to camp out the clerics, the CoG needed some help getting back in for Corpse recovery. Eternal Wrath and the Allied Giants helped us out on getting back in and getting corpses. I'm not aware of that being a violation of KGC rules, as they weren't initially invited as guilds, only brought in to help us with an ugly corpse recovery.<br>

The rules exist to keep people or groups out of the planes who cant handle it to keep the following scenario from happening:<br>
<br>
Guild A signs up for planes<br>
Guild A doesn't have enough strength or peeps<br>
Guild A ( to use your terms) gets annihilated<br>
Guild B recovers corpses and has free reign of the plane<br>
~~later ~~<br>
Guild B has their normal plane raid<br>
~~later~~<br>
Guild B talks guild C into getting a spot even though they are definitely not ready<br>

<br>
Zoning in at once was a big mistake..90% of persons dropped. Just a bad idea, and no real reason for it, We werent going to fight at the portal anyway.<br>
I for one lost con and logged back on to find Invis still holding a few scarelings at the portal, others dwelling about Invis waiting for LD peeps to log back on, or were caught up in lag...there was no reason for people un aggroed Not to move to west camp. I moved quickly to camp, checking on invis and camo and arrived with the 10-12 people that made it there safely.<br>
Suddenly one individual (I wont name, but not a newbie to the planes) Ran down the hill towards group chased by 7 scarelings and a shiverback towards the camp. He didnt quite make it, but one of them nearby aggroed to one other at camp (again wearing planes equip so no newbie to fear)and the other 7 mobs followed him as he ran to middle of camp...Myself and others that were aggroed from that tried to drag away from camp. I feigned some distance away.<br>
But the camp got trashed anyway....no survivors with the exception of three monks one shadow knight and Myself feigned, and i beleive one enchanter managed to log out.<br>
After trying to confirm if a cleric logged, a naked cleric at fear portal was asked to be buffed and sent in...died soon after with a report that the gate had mobs at it.<br>
<br>
Some people petitioned a guide for assistance due to the LD issue, and quite rightly so advised he was unable to assist in the matter (not that he didnt want to)...and then this happened which completely fouled my Mood and confidence in COG...<br>
1/People there began spouting abuse in ooc at this gm, completely disgusting, child like temper tantrums from people who are obviously not adults. I dont want to know these people.<br>
and 2/ To my understanding all CoG' raids have the back up of a planes ready guild to help out..Allied giants I thought. Until a handfull of Allied Giants turned up to break the plane with aggroed mobs at the portal..And was informed prior to this that they would Only help if they could join in on the raid afterwards..(Whether this was true or not, its what I heard). Thanks for the conditional help.<br>
<br>
Well I must say a very good thanks to Eternal Wrath who obliged to come to aid at the request of Ameron and other friends of EW members. And thanks to Allied Giants for being willing to aid us aswell.<br>
<br>
My first raid with CoG....probably my last. im usually willing to give everyone a second chance, but after seeing people that were invited on this raid shouting abuse at GM's not following instructions, etc...I just dont have any confidence that it will ever work.<br>
<br>
Im not saying what I saw is the truth. Only that this is what I percieved and what i think happened.<br>

Not having been there, I have to wait until hearing Zellex's recap of this to hear the story behind the AG's and Eternal Wrath's help. <br>
<br>
Mooshi, as for people signing up for the raid and going, I understand there are some who have signed up for the raids that are in guilds able to do the planes, either through alliances or through their own guilds. I've made a separate post clarifying that these people are not sign up for raids anymore unless they are invited as part of the management body. Also, Mooshi, I have deleted your third post, as it attributed nothing to the discussion other than a flame back at Flarren's comments. Should their be anymore childish, flame type posts on this thread that do not add to the discussion, those will be deleted as well. That goes for anyone contributing to this thread, not just Mooshi. This board is not going to degenerate into backbiting, whining and personal attacks.<br>
<br>
I ask for everyone's help in trying to make sure that only those who could not otherwise get to the planes with their own guild be the ones to sign up for planes raids. As with everything in the Council, I'm relying on individual honor to guide this, because the CoG is not a legislative body, and anything you do to decrease the standing of the CoG decreases us all. Mooshi is right to point out that there were folks on this raid who have other means of getting to the planes. It is not up to Zellex to check whether your guild is eligible under our sign up terms, it is up to you to be honorable and only sign up if you have no other means to get to the planes. If you are asked to be a member of the management body, that is a different story. <br>
<br>
This raid obviously suffered from problems, but I think for the good of all on the server, we can fix them and do a better job next time. <br>

<br>
Furc's post, as well as some other information I've received from a participant, has led me to believe that some folks who were there were:<br>
<br>
1) Abusive to a GM in loud, public channels in a disrespectful fashion<br>
2) Whining about loss of experience upon the breakin<br>
<br>
First off, NO one on ANY raid has the right to be disrespectful in open public channels to a GM or to anyone for that matter. It has no place on a CoG raid and if you feel that you have to do that, excuse yourself from that raid and any in the future. We're all human beings on the other side of the keyboard and you've no right being abusive. If the Guide couldn't or wouldn't help you, tough, it happens, either take it to private tells or shut up. If you must vent, go to the Gameplay Forum on the EQ site, but keep it civil. It's a game, these are people and life's too short. <br>
<br>
Secondly, if you loss experience on a CoG plane raid, that's unfortunately a risk you'll have to take. Planes raids often can lead to multiple deaths, and there is a good chance you might not be able to get your corpse. The management body will do what it can to keep either of these from happening, but if it does, it does, and you've no right to complain about it. You take risks everyday in EQ, risks that you will lose exp. and your corpse. This goes double for the planes raids, or any large raids. These are put on for a group of people (around 4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   or so, and the management body has the responsibility to make it fun for the majority of those 48. If that means a person loses experience because their body couldn't be ressed in time, or another reason, then it can't be helped. <br>
<br>
Make no mistake, the people who organize and run these raids (not just planes raids, but any CoG event/raid) often do so without reward. They can lose experience, they may not get an item, and they spend a night trying to coordinate 40 something people to one end. That is VERY difficult to do, very stressful and very draining. To do so, then to hear someone complain because they lost experience or didn't get an item, is extremely disheartening. If those who complained think they can do better, they are more than welcome to try to lead one of these raids. It's easy to criticize when you are a participant or bystander, but until you've led one of these things, you don't know how difficult it is. So please, if this is a complaint you think you'll feel like making after a raid, don't come. That leaves more room for those who appreciate it. <br>
<br>
This isn't aimed at anyone in specific, I just wanted to state that I don't like hearing such comments come back about a CoG raid. It makes every member of the CoG look bad when it does. And that could be your guild too.<br>

<br>
Mooshi, I am surprised at your outburst considering your history.  Actually, I am not surprised at your rude wording of it considering your history. <br>
<br>
Furc, I have been on previous on raids, and I don't remember people yelling offensive insults.  Either way, whether it's a CoG typical experience or not is up to you to decide.  I do encourage you to talk to your guildmate Simarill or me about previous CoG raids.   <br>
<br>
Idiots tend to exist everywhere.  CoG is more vulnerable to the invasion of stupid people, but is that a good reason to say that CoG is incompetent? Is that a good reason to shun CoG events and staying only in the comfort of familiar people (guilds)?  To me, that would be similar to building &quot;safe living ghettos&quot; to keep undesirable elements out.  Brr.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it is always a challenge to find enough people willing to put in the time and effort to deal with organize these types of events AND behaviour like this.  It takes hard work and a lot of guts to deal with situations like that.  Quite frankly, most guilds are too busy to look beyond their own groupings. So why do it? To improve the Karana community and allow people to not having to chose a guild to be able to participate in events from which they would be typically shunned out just by virtue of not being in the right group of people.<br>
<br>
Anyone organizing a CoG event faces a pretty big risk. Read Haemish's account of his Freeport arena tournament. There will always be some undesirable and selfish behaviour.  Does that only happen to CoG? I doubt it. Will CoG get more criticism because everything is out in the open? You bet it will.  But at least we're making an attempt, and a lot of things have worked out great so far.<br>
<br>
If your main reason to participate in CoG is to get to the planes and get items, I would strongly suggest that the CoG is not up your alley.  Events such as the newbie arena tournament, naked troll run, Kedge raid (bones for pallies) are really the real gems that the CoG comes up with, and for some strange reason, the participants at those events tend to be the most fun, patient and open-minded people I have ever met online.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I am not sure that plane and dragon raids should be CoG organized events...it's a noble service for people who have no alliance or guild, but is it worth it?  <br>

EW and AG came and helped, they did not have free reign of the planes but came and cleared the portal for a CR and then left.<br>
At first the dragged to the west camp but 90% of the corpses had timed out and were unable to be rezzed so they didnt have any other option but to clear a path to the portal.<br>
Unfortanatly the mess caused by the train had thrown mobs off their pathing and instead of 7 wanderers their were quite a few more, but they got the job done and left.<br>
It has been done before when another guild has came to help a bad break (I recall Valorin helping Ohana).<br>
After the CR although alot did leave (was 7am for me and I had to leave the house at 7.30 so sorry but I couldnt stay). EW had left and CoG raiders remaind to do some hunting.<br>
All in all not a huge political situation just some people coming to help for no other reason than they had friends their who were in trouble, they didnt come to steal a planes day, they came becuase we needed help.<br>

<br>
I've often wondered if the CoG should or should not be involved in the Planes thing, but I think you've sort of answered your own question. The CoG does it to help those who otherwise couldn't get to the planes. Those non-guilded individuals, and those who, like the members of my guild, don't want to join another guild just to get to the planes. <br>
<br>
However, the method that we are using to do it does offer up opportunities for error and inefficiencies. We will get the vocal whiners, the undisciplined, and the only there for my items type of people. Which is why I've suggested the method of alliances that you and I have discussed over in the Council Discussions forum. I urge everyone in the CoG to read and discuss this forum thread, because I honestly think in the long run, this will be a better method of getting people to the planes/dragons. <br>
<br>
Please go to this forum and read:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showMessage?topicID=37.topic">pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncil...D=37.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
It isn't a radical new concept, it's been done and is being done by many guilds on the server. <br>
<br>
I want to thank all those who helped run this event and all those who went with the right attitude in mind. Pippi is correct, if you are going to the planes for items and experience, the CoG is not the place for you. That isn't the goal of the CoG planes raids, though there is certainly the chance that the raids will reward some lucky souls with this stuff. But the main goal is to get there and have a fun raid, something that many people would never experience without this vehicle. <br>

<br>
What is in question is point 5 under rotation.  Simple put this was not a god raid.  I was the sole member of Avenging Crusaders to attend and I was in Zellex's managment body.<br>
<br>
My email address is tekmage@amiga.org you can send your apology to that address Mooshi.<br>
<br>
======================================================<br>
<br>
             Rule Number One: Stormbeard must approve everything that goes on here.<br>
             Rule Number Two: If anything goes wrong, blame Vyktor.<br>
<br>
             KGC Courtesy<br>
             1. Post your guild name in your posts often so we know who you are <br>
             representing.<br>
             2. Use common sense when posting and don't flame.<br>
<br>
             Planes Scheduling<br>
             1. The schedule goes up at 11:00 AM EST (8:00 AM PST) every Thursday <br>
             by a DESIGNATED PERSON. Do not start the schedule early just because <br>
             you want to ensure your guild gets a plane day. Also, do not start <br>
             the schedule unless you want to play admin for about an hour (see <br>
             Rule 2). The person who starts the schedule should have a good grasp <br>
             of the rules and guild scheduling patterns.<br>
<br>
             2. When scheduling, list your top 3 or 4 choices. This will help <br>
             ensure you get a plane day, but there are no guarantees. Do not edit <br>
             your post in the schedule thread. Do not repost the entire schedule. <br>
             The topic starter (admin) will compile all the choices and give <br>
             everyone a plane day with priority given on a first come first served <br>
             basis (unless rule 3 applies).<br>
<br>
             3. Guilds up for a god should note that in their post so the schedule <br>
             starter can prioritize them accordingly.<br>
<br>
             4. You can make ONE plane reservation per guild/alliance during the <br>
             first 24 hours. If a spot is still open Friday, you are welcome to <br>
             schedule it then (although this is never the case now-a-days). This <br>
             does not apply to PoA.<br>
<br>
             5. Don't book a weekend plane day 2 weeks in a row.<br>
<br>
             6. Don't book the same plane 2 weeks in a row.<br>
<br>
             7. You can book for the PM (4:00 PM PST?) slot after a European or <br>
             Asian guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
             Planes Courtesy<br>
             1. You should be out of the plane by 6:00 am EST (3:00 AM PST) to <br>
             allow for respawn for the next guild.<br>
<br>
             2. Do not enter a plane on someone else's day unless you check with <br>
             them first. (i.e. killing princesses in PoA or getting quest items) <br>
<br>
             3. Be flexible when dealing with guilds that are up for gods. (i.e. <br>
             swap either the plane or the god or share the plane with them)<br>
<br>
             4. If you fail on 3 successive plane raids you should re-evaluate <br>
             your strategy and stop scheduling planes for a while. Join an <br>
             alliance if you need help or ask to attend someone else's plane raid <br>
             for experience (no loot).<br>
<br>
<br>
             Rotations<br>
             1. You have 24 hours to kill a dragon (or Venril). This means the day <br>
             of spawn unless it spawns after 8:00 PM or you are a European guild.<br>
<br>
             2. You have 48 hours to kill a god (give or take a day for scheduling <br>
             hassles).<br>
<br>
             3. If you're going to pass, do so within a reasonable amount of time. <br>
             (Don't announce you are passing at 8:00 PM.)<br>
<br>
             4. Don't kill FGs on server reset.<br>
<br>
             5. There should be no help from ANY members of other guilds/alliances <br>
             for Gods and Dragons. (does not apply to Vox/Nag, but does apply to <br>
             Venril)<br>
<br>
             6. Post the results here asap (pass/fail/success) so the next guild <br>
             can prepare for their turn.<br>

I still believe that it would be best that those guilds not scheduling planes be the ones signing up for planes, as that is the main person this is trying to help. But I'm certainly open for discussion on this topic.<br>

I would like to tell you all that the player posting under the username Mooshi, is not me. I have no clue who it is. Tekky told me in game about this post, so I came here to see it. I post under the user name of MooshiNC, and Fatmooshi. Whoever has the name Mooshi, is not me. I have no clue about this topic. I didn't really even read it. I just skimmed to the areas where my name was brought up. If anyone wants to see my post name, please go to www.pacifier.com/~zero, and click on forums and read some of our topics in the public forum, you will see my username for ezboards. <br>
<br>
Ill clarify something on my beliefs thou. As far as what you want to do with your guilds, or who you want to invite, it has nothing whatsoever to do with me. I dont care, never will care, and never have cared for what people want to do in EQ. If you want to bring friends to a plane with you, go right ahead, noone can tell you otherwise, its your $10 bucks, not theirs =). Hell, if you need NC's help, send me a tell in game =)<br>
<br>
Anyways, if you have any questions in game about my user id for eboards, please talk to any of my guildmates on what it is. Also ask them my thoughts on how i feel about most of KGC rules. =)))<br>
<br>
The person &quot;mooshi&quot; is not me. I have never even been to this web board until now. Great site btw. Its very nice to see many guilds like this working our well together. If you guys ever need help with anything, Send a tell to me in game, or Fandros, Dyschord, Biggins, Barnard, or Volaro.<br>
<br>
As for the person that mentioned my history, I would like you to know, I am very proud of it, =) and wouldnt change a thing=P<br>
<br>
Signing off.<br>

<br>
Anyway, just thought I would add that. I dont think this is something that &quot;mooshi&quot; knew about before posting under my name. I guess I should have reserved that name instead of what I have. =P<br>

We had a great many people loose connection zonin  in or soon after.  This was I believe the first time we have had to call on help for recovery during a raid.  We have been very successful in these raids and I am sure that will continue in the future.  <br>
<br>
I am happy to be able to thank EW, AG, and any other guild that came to our assistance when we needed it.  I think it speaks to part of the reason why so many people chose not to leave Karana when given the chance, in general we want to help others, to do what is best. <br>
<br>
Right now some people will be thinking I am dangerously naive.  Just look at the what happened when the game customer service staff told those waiting outside Fear that the same favour showing to a group the day before would not be extended again. I think if I was that representative I would expect flak for towing that line. It is not a forgiveable thing though, I hope that we all here want our own reputation add to those here. We must always show respect and courtsey to these people.  <br>
<br>
Thank you MooshiNC for coming to this board and telling us that wasn't you that didn't have a clue how KGC worked when it came to plane raids.  We appericate your support and maybe someday may call for that favour. Don't hesistate to look for a favour here. Perhaps now that you know where we are your guild may look here as well, to add to your game exp and of course ours <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
Some of the things that were special to me that night was being chosen to lead my group on my first plane raid, later after our CR recovery was successfully done I got to be main tank for the raid &lt;read no other warriors present&gt;.  I had a great time just for those reasons alone.  I was happy to see Gdanzig, of my guild, get to pull up there and do well and to see why Kordail is such a good shaman.  So many others added to a good time for me that I can't list all of them, but thanks to Volan, Zellex, Goldmond, Jujub, Katellin, Lindam, Ziwut, Lagdelan, Kordail, and Rowbert.  I grouped with you and maybe some more and it was a pleasure to do so. <br>
<br>
I spent too many hours sittin in Freeport that night than I like, being asked for SOW, and if given a chance I would do it again for the same reward I got this time, which was the time spent facing a challenge with so many others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A
