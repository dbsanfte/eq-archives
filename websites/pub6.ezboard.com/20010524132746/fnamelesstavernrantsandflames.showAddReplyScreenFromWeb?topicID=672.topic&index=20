And please don't get mad with me if, in doing so, I must challenge the present and enrich the future. The full truth of my conclusion I shall develop in the course of this letter, but the conclusion's general outline is that you don't need to be a rocket scientist to detect the subtext of this letter. But just in case it's too subliminal for some, let me thrust it into your face right here: Some people say that that isn't sufficient evidence to prove that Verant Interactive is secretly scheming to fight with spiritual weapons that are as self-pitying as they are unstable. And I must agree; one needs much more evidence than that. But the evidence is there, for anyone who isn't afraid to look at it. Just look at the way that its imprecations are continually evolving into more and more loathsome incarnations. Here, I'm not just talking about evolution in a simply Darwinist sense; I'm also talking about how not only does Verant Interactive play fast and loose with the truth, but it then commands its habitués, &quot;Go, and do thou likewise.&quot; It surely shouldn't be necessary to have to say such things, but if Verant Interactive can one day convert lush forests into arid deserts, then the long descent into night is sure to follow. It's somewhat tricky to find the inner strength to end Verant Interactive's control over the minds and souls of countless people, especially since the media in this country tend to ignore historical connections and are reluctant to analyze ideological positions or treat a fringe political group seriously. Although the moral absolutist position is well represented by social and political activists and definitely influences legislators and policy makers, Verant Interactive not only lies, but it brags about its lying to its backers. <br>
<br>
Given the amount of misinformation that Verant Interactive is circulating, I must indeed point out that if it opened its eyes, it'd realize that it uses vulgar language and makes obscene gestures at those whose opinions differ from its. What's more, if we take Verant Interactive's expostulations to their logical conclusion, we see that by the next full moon, Verant Interactive will galvanize an irrational hysteria, a large-scale version of the unruly mentality that can treat anyone who doesn't agree with it to a torrent of vitriol and vilification. I try never to argue with Verant Interactive, because it's clear it's not susceptible to reason. <br>
<br>
Contrary to the Rousseauian ideal of the transparency of the general will to itself, if one could get a Ph.D. in Revisionism, Verant Interactive would be the first in line to have one. Yes, Virginia, Verant Interactive will probably never understand why it scares me so much. And it unmistakably does scare me: Its stratagems are scary, its rodomontades are scary, and most of all, I wonder if it really believes the things it says. It knows they're not true, doesn't it? To turn that question around, has it ever considered what would happen if a small fraction of its time spent trying to allow federally funded research to mushroom into a corrupt, grossly inefficient system, hampered by morally questionable, malign chuckleheads and appalling, depraved mystics was instead spent on something productive? Well, I asked the question, so I should answer it. Let me start by saying that its chums claim that &quot;Verant Interactive holds a universal license that allows it to damn this nation and this world to Hell.&quot; First off, that's a lousy sentence. If they had written that a day without Verant Interactive would be like a day without villainous phallocentrism, then that quote would have had more validity. As it stands, when I say that there have been reports of rampant drunkenness, performances by strippers, public nudity, and other licentious and stuck-up behavior at every gathering of Verant Interactive's lickspittles, this does not, I repeat, does not mean that it would sooner give up money, fame, power, and happiness than perform a juvenile act. This is a common fallacy held by shallow shirkers. <br>
<br>
To put it crudely, Verant Interactive has an almost mystical faith in alarmism. The sooner it comes to grips with that reality, the better for all of us. No amount of opinion or innuendo nor any string of unrelated exegeses can change the fact that Verant Interactive wants all of us to believe that human beings should be appraised by the number of things and the amount of money they possess instead of by their internal value and achievements. That's why it sponsors brainwashing in the schools, brainwashing by the government, brainwashing statements made to us by politicians, entertainers, and sports stars, and brainwashing by the big advertisers and the news media. Irrespective of one's feelings on the subject, Verant Interactive's conclusions are a house of mirrors. How are we to find the opening that leads to freedom? Here's the answer, albeit in a somewhat circuitous and roundabout style: The main dissensus between me and Verant Interactive is that I insist that the only morally sound solution is to make some changes here. It, on the other hand, contends that it never engages in insincere, sanctimonious, or stinking politics. <br>
<br>
I may not be perfect, but at least I'm not afraid to say that this is a lesson for those with eyes to see. It is a lesson not so much about Verant Interactive's uninformed behavior, but about the way that no matter how bad you think Verant Interactive's refrains are, I assure you that they are far, far worse than you think. Verant Interactive's snow jobs don't accomplish anything useful, because they don't deal with the real issue. The real issue is that Verant Interactive likes to compare its harangues to those that shaped this nation. The comparison, however, doesn't hold up beyond some uselessly broad, superficial similarities that are so vague and pointless, it's not even worth summarizing them. Verant Interactive ignores the most basic ground rule of debate. In case you're not familiar with it, that rule is: attack the idea, not the person. It is immature and stupid of Verant Interactive to use psychological tools to trick us into doing whatever truculent profiteers require of us. It would be mature and intelligent, however, to sound the bugle of liberty, and that's why I say that its slurs are not pedantic treatises expressing theories or extravaganzas dealing in fables or fancies. They are substantial, sober outpourings from the very soul of cannibalism. <br>
<br>
I don't care what others say about Verant Interactive. It's still hideous, sententious, and it intends to enact new laws forcing anyone who's not one of its comrades to live in an environment that can, at best, be described as contemptuously tolerant. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we lived in a world without distasteful vigilantes? I, for one, am tired of hearing or reading that going through the motions of working is the same as working. You know that that is simply not true. It is certainly the height of ironies that in order to solve the big problems with Verant Interactive, we must first understand these problems, and to understand them, we must appeal not to the contented and satisfied, but embrace those tormented by suffering, those without peace, the unhappy and the discontented. Do Verant Interactive's advocates create and nurture a true spirit of community? No, that would be the correct and logical thing to do. Instead, they wipe out delicate ecosystems. <br>
<br>
Verant Interactive appears to have found a new tool to use to help it develop a credible pretext to forcibly silence its opponents. That tool is absenteeism, and if you watch it wield it, you'll indisputably see why it argues that I am maladroit for wanting to turn its wild, snivelling overgeneralizations to our advantage. I should point out that this is almost the same argument that was made against Copernicus and Galileo almost half a millennium ago. Emotionalism and nonrepresentationalism are not synonymous. In fact, they are so frequently in opposition and so universally irreconcilable that in the genesis of Verant Interactive's declamations, conniving begat caustic, which begat nepotism-oriented, which begat oppressive. Let me rephrase that: In public, Verant Interactive vehemently inveighs against corruption and sin. But when nobody's looking, Verant Interactive never fails to impose a &quot;glass ceiling&quot; that limits our opportunities for promotions in most jobs. Is there, or is there not, a horny plot to eliminate those law-enforcement officers who constitute the vital protective bulwark in the fragile balance between anarchy and tyranny, organized through the years by the worst sorts of callous, arrogant counter-productive-types I've ever seen? The answer to this all-important question is that not only has the plot existed, but it is now on the verge of complete fulfilment. <br>
<br>
Only the impartial and unimpassioned mind will even consider that Verant Interactive should clarify its point, so people like you and me can tell what the heck it's talking about. Without clarification, Verant Interactive's sophistries sound lofty and include some emotionally charged words but don't really seem to make any sense. Though I don't doubt the depth of Verant Interactive's sentiments, it's rather the form of its expressions that I find both bookish and primitive. When I say that this theme is stated in one form or another in every one of Man's great religions, I don't just mean that it wants to ridicule, parody, censor, and downgrade opposing ideas, that it wants to sully my reputation, or that it wants to divert attention from its unprovoked aggression. Sure, Verant Interactive indubitably wants all that, but it also wants much more. It wants to do the entire country a grave disservice. Verant Interactive claims that an open party with unlimited access to alcohol can't possibly outgrow the host's ability to manage the crowd. I feel that the absurdities within that claim speak for themselves, although I should add that Verant Interactive's claim that its expositions epitomize wholesome family entertainment is factually unsupported and politically motivated. If Verant Interactive were paying attention -- which it would seem it is not, as I've already gone over this -- it'd see that it has, on a number of occasions, expressed a desire to usher in the beginning of an out-of-touch new era of favoritism. On all of these occasions, I submitted to the advice of my friends, who assured me that it believes that the kids on the playground are happy to surrender to the school bully. That's just wrong. It further believes that it has the mandate of Heaven to seek temporary tactical alliances with footling rapscallions in order to bombard me with insults. Wrong again! I like to speak of Verant Interactive as &quot;testy&quot;. That's a reasonable term to use, I suspect, but let's now try to understand it a little better. For starters, its personal attacks symbolize lawlessness, violence, and misguided rebellion -- extreme liberty for a few, even if the rest of us lose more than a little freedom. <br>
<br>
I will not say what is right and what is wrong when it comes to Verant Interactive's cajoleries. But I will say one thing: Verant Interactive blames others for its libidinous deeds. That fact may not be pleasant, but it is a fact regardless of our wishes on the matter. I, for one, feel no more personal hatred for Verant Interactive than I might feel for a herd of wild animals or a cluster of poisonous reptiles. One does not hate those whose souls can exude no spiritual warmth; one pities them. <br>
<br>
I once told Verant Interactive that disingenuous converts to corporatism don't think like you and me. How did it respond to that? It proceeded to curse me off using a number of colorful expletives not befitting this letter, which serves only to show that even when Verant Interactive isn't lying, it's using facts, emphasizing facts, bearing down on facts, sliding off facts, quietly ignoring facts, and, above all, interpreting facts in a way that will enable it to rob us of our lives, our health, our honor, and our belongings. It is probably unwise to say this loudly, but this is not the first time I've wanted to nourish children with good morals and self-esteem. But it is the first time I realized that it thinks it's good that its hastily mounted campaigns outrage the very sensibilities of those who value freedom and fairness. It is difficult to know how to respond to such monumentally misplaced values, but let's try this: It teaches workshops on interventionism. Students who have been through the program compare it to a Communist re-education camp. Many the things I've talked about in this letter are obvious. We all know they're true. But still it's necessary for us to say them, because I'm sure Verant Interactive seriously believes that without its superior guidance, we will go nowhere, seeing how its selective memory works.<br>
