No one in FK sent a single tell nor a single question in RTA.  The story for why it happened changed twice - first, that the mob in question was up for 24 hours, second story, oops, we thought all of Xmas was FFA.  Their second story was also discredited, as SotE got called on the same thing when they were taking Tindi's Statue.  That situation worked out differently, because Tindi had an option, it was caught beforehand.  SotE was prepared to back off.  NB was not offered that opportunity, and our mob was stolen without a single tell, or question to the RTA.  That kind of behavior is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
As for consistency, I agree, whoever jumped Trak should get punished.  However, I wasn't involved in that situation - I am involved in this.  This situation has not been resolved to NB's satisfaction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thundaxstormkeeper>Thundax Stormkeeper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/31/02 2:06:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No</span><hr size=1> I am of the belief that a guild who breaks rotation rules should be forced to miss a round of the rotation. This should probably mean that they are moved on the rotation list to the spot in which they jumped the spawn, but then next time their turn comes around they pass it.<br>
<br>
This would mean that a guild who breaks rotation rules misses one turn at that rotation. Most of the guilds involved are fairly relaxed and are almost always willing to offer a little leeway to other guilds. However, this leeway does not extend to guilds killing mobs out of order as this should never happen. If you have any doubts as to whether it is your turn or not, you should speak to the other guilds concerned.<br>
<br>
If punishments are not enforced on guilds that break rules, then in the future it will create a situation where people may kill a mob when it is not their turn because they can see it wielding a specific weapon or something. If there are no real punishments for doing this, then there is nothing stopping this from happening.<br>
<br>
As far as the RTA being able to enforce punishments, I don't think this is an issue. The RTA is not just half a dozen admins, it is a collection of guilds on the server. If someone refuses to accept punishments decided by the other guilds on that rotation, then there would be the possibility that the other guilds may decide to revoke the perpetrator's rotation rights.<br>
<br>
It may sound harsh, but for a system to work, there must be rules which are enforceable and consequences if those rules are not followed.<br>

<br>
I guess I'm missing something.  If NB wanted them to skip their next go around as a punishment, then tell them to and let this be over with.<br>
<br>
If NB desires another punishment, Karadin, then work that punishment out with them.   They don't seem very resistant and closed minded right now.<br>
<br>
I also think that they provided a very good example of what to do when a guild is in the wrong.  <br>

yeah yeah, shuddap.<br>

Maybe RTA can discuss this situation and come up with a definite penalty for future instances.  Like he said, can't penalize one guild and smack another one on the wrist.<br>
<br>
There has been a screw up, the screw up has been admitted and appologized for, so i dont think there is need to continually castigate Frayed Knot.<br>
<br>
IMO the idea changing their spot in the KT rot and them losing a turn is a good idea.  Whether this was an honest mistake or not, there has to be consequences.  Missing their next KT spawn will make FK, and anyone else who thinks jumping out of turn is a good idea think twice before acting on that impulse.  A presidence must be set.  If not, there is no reason for any other guild to obey the RTA.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion<br>

If what is stated about the Trak situation is true and the 2 guilds involved were able to work out a solution without RTA involvment then thats great.<br>
<br>
If what i mention above is true then i stick by the original arrangement of BotS supporting FK being placed ahead of NB on the rotation and then skipped on their next turn. This would mean they would miss the spawn they were supposed to be up for but ninja'd and the spawn after. <br>
<br>
Any guild that fails to follow rotations for whatever reason should have penalties given or else there is no reason to have them at all. This server has been one of the most civil servers for as long as the game has been live due to the fact that we made rotations. If you dont agree with them and want to screw them up, deal with the consequences.  They wont be pretty as it only hurts the smaller guilds if you want to go FFA and not follow what rotations we have tried to set. <br>
<br>
Anyways this matter wont be resolved til i see Karadin or another NB rep post they are ok with a solution as they were the guild directly affected by the incident. Personally i think the one mentioned is the most fair FK will see and I agree with it completely as a BotS rep.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malystryxvof>MalystryxVoF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/31/02 6:49:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ziekjes.homestead.com/files/dakkon2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Frayed Knot != math geniuses</span><hr size=1> oh uhh Milambus...<br>

You all had something planned and your plans got screwed up and lots of folks probably won't be able to attend the next round due to it not being a holiday or whatever. But, you have to think a little less one sided, you're not the only one affected, like I said before it was a screw up and I am pretty sure they're all a little embarrassed over the whole thing. They've probably apologized to you and to the community maybe even in this thread, don't feel like going back to look.

Regarding this other situation....Karadin you talk about how you are the 'effected' guild and you want blood etc... let's play a little game.<br>
<br>
Let's say it was two...three hours later, or whatever long enough to have a confirmed uptime on Tormax of 24 hours and FK HAD killed him 'legally' under the Christmas rules.<br>
<br>
What happens to NB? Nothing except a few day wait to get the next Tormax spawn, and the rotation continues as normal. FK is guilty of bad manners towards NB in this case, but I somehow think it would be hard for you to dislike us more anyway.<br>
<br>
Now if you be the bigger man, let the precedent stand in this situation  then  NB STILL takes the next Tormax, and FK skips their upcoming Tormax and NB gets their NEXT tormax one spawn sooner then if we had killed him legit that night anyway. <br>
<br>
It's all ready been said how embarrased we are as a collective entity of assing it up so badly, we have and are continuing to take internal measures to make sure nothing like this can ever happen again. FK fully supports the RTA and what it stands for. <br>
<br>
However we have no desire to be 'punished' for this stupid mistake then any other guild who also made this same mistake.<br>
<br>
And it's funny, I am POSITIVE I saw the Trakanon situation posted on the RTA in one of the rotation related forums when it came up some months ago, and an apology by the guild who killed out of turn and postings by the reps approving a swap or whatever the final solution was, scanning the forums now I can find nothing of the sort. Was the thread deleted after this was resolved, and if so why? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 753<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/31/02 1:11:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Frayed Knot != math geniuses</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>stupid mistake then any other guild who also made this same mistake.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

If NB had made this mistake we would be proposing this same &quot;punishment&quot; for ourselves, as BotS has done in the past when they had internal miscommunications regarding Cursed rotation.  They volunteered to skip 2 kills (their next that they had already taken, and another as punishment) on thier own.  This is where the idea comes from.<br>

It's about precedent, already we have FK pointing to some VOLS/ED Trak issue I know nothing about as a reason they should be allowed to get away with KSing our King Tormax.  Where does it end?  If you guys get away with it, then people have two precedents, next thing you know, rotations mean nothing, and people can kill out of turn and just say &quot;oops, sorry about that&quot;, and everything is ok.  That's a wrong answer in my book.<br>
<br>
If ED/VOLS were able to work out their differences without involving the RTA, that is between them, and has nothing to do with FK/NB.  Personally, I think whoever KSed Trak should be punished, but it doesn't involve me.  However, the KT situation does, and this wasn't just a mistake, it was completely mishandled from A to Z.  You killed a mob that wasn't up for 24 hours, you didn't send a tell or ask in RTA before you killed him under &quot;FFA&quot; rules, you didn't send a tell or ask in RTA AFTER you killed him when you realized you messed up.  You left NB to find out on  its own that KT had been KSed.<br>
<br>

<br>
Sure, I'll play that game, that means FK would have waited until 4pm PST on Saturday to kill him.  I am ok with that, because if we ever took 16 hours to kill King Tormax, I would probably /guilddisband.  Let's review the timeline here:<br>
<br>
8 pm PST (11 EST) Thursday servers crash<br>
12 am PST Friday Karadin checks on KT to see in what order NB should plan their mobs (yay for SoS)<br>
4 pm PST Friday Karadin recieves a tell from Malystrx of VoF that King Tormax is up<br>
9pm PST (12 pm EST) Friday King Tormax is killed by FK<br>
12am PST Friday NB moves to Kael to kill KT, but he is already dead.<br>
<br>
Explain to me first how it happened.  Wait, that's been done, with two different stories.  First story, KT was up over 24 hours (all but impossible given that server crash was 25 hours before you killed him, he would have had to spawn on server up: he hadn't even spawn 4 hours after server up, I checked).  Second story, that an entire guild of mostly above college age people misread Vince's post about special holiday rotation exceptions and thought every mob was FFA.  This was able to happen because both RTA reps for FK were conveniently missing at the time (Jlxaac and Jurassic), and couldn't correct the misunderstanding about the post.<br>
<br>
Now explain something even more basic.  I got ZERO tells from anyone even remotely affiliated with FK leadership before they went to kill KT (I was on all day).  I saw ZERO questions in RTA channel about &quot;Hey, KT has been up over 24 hours, we're gonna kill him under FFA, ok?&quot;.  I got ZERO tells AFTER you killed him and Jlxaac knew you guys had killed out of turn.  Why?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>FK is guilty of bad manners towards NB in this case, but I somehow think it would be hard for you to dislike us more anyway.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The only thing I dislike about FK is the dual-wielded chips you seem to wear firmly planted on both shoulders.  I have had Jlxaac, Fere, Eros, Xarien, Dannis, and many other FK members on NB raids in the last 3 years (gladly and with much respect).  I'm the one who opened Jaled Dar's door for Sylph to do his ST key turn in.  Yah, you caught me Jurassic, I just love to hate FK, it's my driving force in life (/sarcasm off).  Hell, I remember when most of you weren't FK, but wore Far Runner tags and we were all in one big happy alliance together back in the day for planar raids.  I have no reason to dislike you save the one I just listed, namely that you guys seem to have such a big problem with us to include even the most basic of communications on rotation mobs.<br>
<br>
The reason NB doesn't find itself in this situation is because Milambus and I make damn sure to be certain we are communicate with the rest of the community on any questionable mobs we are going to kill.  If something has been up 24 hours, I check with the guild in question first before moving on it.  Why?  Because its that important to maintain the basic premise of rotations - that you don't kill out of order.<br>
<br>

<br>
This isn't about being practical and caring how soon we get our next KT and the one after that.  It's about precedent and complete disregard for the most basic part of a rotation.  All your recommendation does is allow FK to walk away without so much as a slap on the wrist for forcibly switching places in the rotation with us.  You &quot;skipping&quot; the next turn is a joke, as you aren't &quot;skipping&quot; anything, you ALREADY killed this turn, you just did it three weeks earlier than you would have if you followed rotation order.  How does letting you get away with this make me a bigger or better man?  I understand we all make mistakes, but come on.<br>

None of your raid leaders are ebayed newbs with no clue about how rotations work.  They've already all been on this server, working with the system for well over two years.

We would voluntarily take this &quot;punishment&quot;, or penalty for making this kind of error.  BotS has already done so twice in the last 4 months on Cursed rotation situations.  We haven't had to yet, because as I cited above, we put a lot of effort into making sure we don't make these kinds of mistakes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sylph@therathetravelagency>Sylph</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Frayed Knot - GL</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/31/02 8:06:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   blah</span><hr size=1> First off, as already explianed, FK was under the mistaken impression that KT was FFA (yes our college grads can skim a post and miss something), why would we contact anyone?  Would NB send us a tell if they were about to kill Lozidal?  I fail to see your logic here Karadin.<br>
<br>
Currently this is how the KT rot stands<br>
NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS - SotE<br>
<br>
Fk going out of turn directly effects 3 guilds, NB, TL, LoM. I fail to understand why people seem to think this is just an issue with NB, our mistake effected TL and LoM just as much.  Our mistake also indirectly effected the rest of the guilds on the KT rotation.<br>
<br>
As for skippin turns, easy to make that punishment for yourself where there are 2 or 3 guilds on a 3 day rotation.  Skipping one KT spawn equates to 5 months with the current guilds on rotation and spawn time of KT.<br>
<br>
The total effect of our mistake was to make 3 guilds wait one week each, so what seems reasonable to me is for us to wait 3 weeks for our next KT.<br>
<br>
NB - TL - LoM - FK - VoF - LoL - BotS - SotE<br>
becomes<br>
NB - TL - LoM - VoF - LoL - BotS - FK - SotE<br>
and we skip the turn we took out of place<br>
<br>
I know the other two GL's of FK feel that my proposal is still harsh and do not fully agree with me (since we did not intentionally ninja the spawn, why should we get punished like we did), but I personally feel that it is the right thing to do.<br>

<br>
And yes, Noble Blade has always sent tells and discussed in RTA on nights with emergency patches when rotation mobs become FFA to avoid being eaten by the patch.  I still make sure we don't take mobs people plan on keeping their turns for by sending tells.<br>
<br>
It's odd you would treat rotations with more guilds on it as deserving of different penalties than those with smaller numbers, when I would argue that even more stringent care needs to be taken not to mess up and kill out of turn.  You have no one to blame but yourselves for KSing our mob, and how long it takes before you get to kill him again doesn't change my mind on how serious of a violation this is.  You killed out of turn, and the rules for that have been clear for a very long time.<br>
<br>
As for your analysis of what the effect is, I disagree.  You are minimalizing at best.  For one thing, you didn't directly interuppt LoM or TLs plans for the night.  Sure you residually affected TL and LoM by putting them off a week each as well, but you were a direct downer to how we ended our night.  Put yourself in our shoes - next night you plan on doing Vindi, Statue, King Tormax, and Yelinak - you get to Yelinak and find nothing but a mystery to solve as to where your mob is.  Then have it turn out that we KSed your mob.   I know if we KSed a mob of yours, you'd be plenty pissed at us, and understandably so.<br>
<br>
Your proposal is no penalty, and since we can't have our KT back, I don't see why you shouldn't accept the standing punishment for breaking rotations.  There is no reason you shouldn't have checked ahead of time, or come forward on your own about this situation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xpedia>Xpedia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EotF - Guild Rep</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/31/02 11:52:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> I am a new rep for my guild, so i am paying more attn to these boards though I have often cruised them for the pure reading enjoyment of it all.

If I am not mistaken you will get to kill him again before SotE gets to go?  I can't believe no one else has laid into you for that one.  Did someone say something about math geniuses?  Either that or I am reading that wrong because its not entirely clear.  The other way I see to interpret it is that you all will skip that turn when it comes and take it the next time around, which is more or less what everyone else is saying (before SotE or before NB is one guild difference, big deal).  I may have missed the boat entirely on that one too, happens often.<br>
<br>
I don't think you should be held to a different standard than anyone else, but you shouldn't be able to pick your standard.  There seem to be two precedents to go on and one is much more palatable than the other.  No one wants to be punished, thats why its a punishment.  To say you are sorry and you feel bad is good, I commend you for that.  I don't think it is a good standard though to let people off with a &quot;sorry, we screwed up&quot; though.  The Rathe is orderly for a reason and to let things go can create a slippery slope<br>
<br>
I think that with a change or lapse in rules some screw ups are bound to happen, but I personally would take extra caution in breaking form the norm by sending tells to double check.  Bottom line is that there needs to be something put in place by the RTA that is agreed upon ahead of time for address this.  That way if it happens its a non issue and the motives behind it are irrelevant.  Its hard to hold someone to a standard that wasn't officially in place.<br>
<br>
My opinion, for what its worth.<br>
