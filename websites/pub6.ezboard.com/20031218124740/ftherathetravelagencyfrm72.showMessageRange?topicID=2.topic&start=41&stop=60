<br>
- It takes creativity to *really* roleplay.   I'm not talking about folks who &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; all the time.<br>
- It takes time to type in roleplay mode.  That frequently gets in the way of doing other stuff, like casting spells and the like.<br>
- There are other/better avenues for chat channels if what you really want to do it type to other people.<br>
- Few people who play EQ were actually exposed to real roleplaying (pen+paper, for example).  Most are Generation-N (Nintendo) where roleplaying was simply not an option to explore.  (I think this is one of the biggest reasons)<br>
- There is no inherent reward in EQ for roleplaying.  For example, in pen+paper RP, the goal was weaving a story and sharing in it (by all the players and the GM).  There is no weaving of stories in the same way in EQ simply by game design.  You can &quot;slay the foul beast&quot; Nagafen 100s of times if you feel like.  EQ's rewards are material (new weapon, new armor piece), for the most part.<br>
- (kind of related to the above) There are no NPC &quot;characters&quot; really in the game.  In p+p (pen+paper) games, you usually made enemies/allies who appeared from time to time.  Having various protagonists and antagonists in the story add life to it.  Of course, in p+p, the good antagonists always escaped at the last moment and such so you had story line to build later.  There are no life-long enemy NPCs in EQ.  They don't follow you around.  They don't interfere in your plans when you are off in another zone doing something unrelated.  You can't discover some new plot by the antagonist that you have to unravel and thwart.<br>
- (related to the above) EQ's content is static.  You go up to an NPC and hail them and you get the same stuff every time. Or, every person does the same sequence of things to get to Point B from Point A.  More interesting would be some &quot;randomizing&quot; of quests and encounters so that they would be different for every person.  There would be no/few walkthroughs as a consequence.  For example, every person who completed the epic quest would have done different things (maybe the starting point was the same but each person would have had some, even if just a couple, different NPCs to go talk to and/or items to retrieve).  That way the story you play becomes *your* story and not everyone's story that did the same exact thing.<br>
- Too many &quot;roleplayers&quot; fall into the cliches and flubs of roleplaying (see below)<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
Unfortunately, most &quot;roleplayers&quot; in EQ fall into many of what I consider are the roleplaying cliches and/or flubs...<br>
- Using &quot;thee&quot;, &quot;thou&quot;, or basically any Olde English style roleplay.<br>
- Lesbian weddings/relationships (done to death - think of something new)<br>
- The use of any communication channel other than /say or /emotes.  Although, I could go as far as saying that you have some sort of &quot;initiation ceremony&quot; to become &quot;attuned&quot; to your guild and you all send/receive telepathic messages or something.<br>
- People who play stereotypical roles.  Why can't someone play a cultured/intelligent/proper troll/ogre?  He didn't fit in with his home crowd so he left to see the world, for instance.<br>
- People who constantly invoke the name of their diety in everything they do.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying is about exploring new avenues of character other than your own real one.  It doesn't necessarily have to be about playing a stereotypical fantasy novel/movie character.  Originality is huge component for roleplaying.<br>
<br>
At one time, the PVP servers were considered some of the best roleplaying servers too.  Not in that they necessarily ran around using &quot;flowery&quot; speach but in their practices.  For instance, one guild required every player who wanted a specific item drop from some mob to fight it out to see who got the item.  The last person standing of those who wanted the item got it.  Also, some zones were &quot;owned&quot; by certain guilds and/or races - you venture into Lower Guk and not be in the &quot;in crowd&quot; there and you got chased out.<br>
<br>
I submitted a suggestion once that seemed pretty simple.  I've never seen it done yet though even though it was available in the game mechanics all along.  I proposed that some &quot;boarder&quot; zones, like South Karana, actually have a current &quot;alliance&quot; that is facilitated by (lots of) wandering spawns.  When the zone first comes up, 1/2 the wanderers are &quot;good&quot; types and 1/2 are &quot;evil&quot; types.  They will fight each other if they agro.  They also fight players of the opposite faction when they encounter them.  When a &quot;good&quot; NPC is killed, the next spawn would be an &quot;evil&quot; NPC and vice versa.  So, it'd be possible for the trolls/ogres to go there and kill all the &quot;good&quot; NPCs and you'd have all evil ones there which would make things more difficult for any &quot;good&quot; players who come into the zone.  The zone would be safer then for any &quot;evils&quot; who want to travel through the zone or whatever.  This is simple but it gives a few things... first and biggest is for the players to actually be able to shape the game in a modest way.  YOU contributed to fighting and converting SK to the evil side (winning a small battle type thing).  Another is that the zone will always be in some unknown state and  you have to go there to see what it's like before you could travel through there or XP there.  Guilds/groups could even get together to go &quot;rid SK of the infidels and make it safe for the good-folk&quot; or something as sort of raids or convert the zone to run the opposite aligned folks out so that your aliance can use the zone safely for a while.  Even these small things would add life to the roleplaying aspect of the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=veneabloodfeast>Venea Bloodfeast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/12/03 8:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm72.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=44>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /join roleplay</span><hr size=1> i think one reason people dont roleplay much (and maybe it was mentioned up above, i kind of skimmed...hehe), is because people CAN and DO petition it as harrassment.<br>
im a dark elf necromancer, and the most roleplay i do is saying the good thing a paladin can do is fill my tummy.   nothing like a pally spinning on a stick over a fire, still in its armor.<br>
<br>
were i allowed to truely roleplay, id still group with them, but id do so grudgingly, probably saying something along the lines of not being able to find anything better than the scrapings of a warriors boot.  id deride them, telling them how their &quot;good deeds&quot; and &quot;noble acts&quot; are a waste of time and energy, and how they will ultimately lose their little war on evil, because hate is all consuming, and will destroy them, their entire pathetic race, and even their god.<br>
<br>
and thats just pallys <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

for others, id probably just be sarcastic, but still end with the speech about hate.<br>

oh, another quasi-RP thing i do.....i question clerics in groups im in who they worship, and if they say Innoruuk, i congratulate them for worshipping the only true god.<br>

That woudl be annoying and I can see where someone might consider it harrasing.  Of course there is the Roleplay Server, but to be honest that server just never seems to have gotten the idea down right.<br>

I do not consider Roleplay being just thee and tho and all that.  A real rollplay would not group godo to evil and frog to troll and Necromancer to Palladin.  If you do it you will be soloing a shit load of the time as getting a like minded group would be extremely difficult.<br>

The paladin does not judge teh dark elf on the color of his skin, but on his actions. You may tell me that the warrior is a shadow knight, but I judge a knight on his actions and evidence, not on tales told behind his back.<br>
<br>
And to fight a great evil, sometimes one must accept teh presence of a disgusting necromancer.<br>

And there is always the possibility of redemption if the lowly are given a good example, for what is teh point of knighthood, if not to set a noble example.<br>

There are plenty of ways to create a story that explains why a DE can be &quot;family&quot; with say, a Druid.<br>
<br>
And there are plenty of ways to explain, for example, why a DE SK loves killing other DE NPCs in Dulak.<br>
<br>
Just because Sony didn't script it in doesn't mean you can't make up your own storyline.<br>
<br>
And when in battle, roleplay doesn't have to be cumbersome.  So my hotkeys are programmed with a little more than &quot;%T inc&quot; (I say something like &quot;%T inc, he/she is a puny and ugly.&quot;).<br>
<br>
When I want the shammy to slow, I tell em slow the mob.  Not big deal, I haven't dropped roleplay at all.<br>
<br>
I even role play the 2 box.  I do it so well that unless I'm asked directly if I'm 2 boxing, some ppl don't know (they think my clr is the quiet type).  To those in past guilds who didn't notice (although it was a bit obvious since the first names are one letter different and the surnames are the same, as is the race) Yes Salura and Salur are the same player, more than just fraternal twin brother and sister.<br>

God..I just love these types of statements.<br>

People who do Roleplay are socially stunted in real life and need to play an 'alternate' identity in a Online Fantasy Video Game in a vain attempt to replace their useless real life with that of a Half-Elf Druid or a Iksar Monk.

<br>
Anyways, these guys were great! They were in character all the time. They did not concentrate on raiding. They were assassins. You had to be willing to swear loyalty to them, and not to your &quot;team&quot;. If you were a player and UberplayerX always wiped the floor with you when you tried to hunt, you could hire these guys to wipe this guy out. <br>
<br>
They did everything from assassinations, interferance (They once were hired to stop uberguildX from getting to MobZ first by attacking them enroute, thus uberguildY got the mob first). <br>
<br>
Prices were high, and they sometimes would demand loot rights to X piece off of Z mob. But nobody messed with these guys. They had members in various guilds that were acting as spies for them and nobody knew who was where. <br>
<br>
Dont know how long they lasted, or if they are still there, or if they still follow that charter, but that was one hell of a concept! <br>

Every &quot;group&quot; and genre has a different idea of what they decide roleplay is, and various levels of depth.<br>
<br>
There is no right or wrong in the style or focus of what you and your own group do as roleplay, it is what level of depth is right for you.<br>
<br>
We focus on the personality of our characters rather then the environment, which we have played through several games as the same people they were when we started them on Yserbius. ( I won't go into detail, because face it, no one cares ;p)  <p><CENTER><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 >

<br>
If I am doing a pen and paper RPG, then I can encourage and explain roleplay to those playing.<br>
<br>
Ir someone violates their alignment, a paladin stealing, or a cleric refusing to render aid, without really good explanation and circumstance, the GM can take some action.<br>
<br>
There is no way for someone to learn roleplay in a online MPRPG. You either bring it with you, or you don't.<br>
<br>
The RPers can attempt to teach the other players, but that is very hard to do in an on-line environment.<br>
Guilds help, but someone who don't get it....and doesn't want to, you are wasteing your breath.<br>
<br>
I know I was very disappointed when I first realized this 3 years ago. But I found other RPers and I have learned to enjoy the game either way. <br>
<br>
I think you are incorrect in your assumption that people who don't RP are lazy or unimaginative. You are just expecting too much. For them this is pac man with pretty pictures, and they will probably never get it.<br>
<br>
But hey I played pac man too. <p>Shariona Seerkin Circle of Virtue<br>

<br>
You said you hated Roleplay because of all the &quot;the and thou crap&quot; and I can't agree more.  This is Norrath, not Earth in the 1400's.  <br>
<br>
Those who think roleplay is just the flowery speech don't understand, and do a diservice to roleplay.<br>
<br>
Yes, our GMs have no input into making things roleplay unlike in pen &amp; paper GMs.<br>
<br>
How do you learn roleplay if you never had any experience?  Strat off by reading the EQ storyline and history stuff.  Then Based on your character rae and class choice, create a personality for your toon, and a history and storyline that explains your coming to existance in Norrath.<br>
<br>
You can promote this by adding information to your inspect window (to do this, you change views with the f9 key until you can target and inspect yourself, then you can type in information into the black window that people see when they inspect you.  And btw, if you start doing this, be sure to not get ticked off at folks when they inspect you).<br>
<br>
You can also promote this by learning to talk and act your storyline into your chats.  An example might be &quot;I'm going to kick butt in Erudin.  Those folks have it coming for killing my family.  I hate Erudites.&quot; instead of saying &quot;hey, lets xp grind in Erudin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Notice I never used any of the old earth english.  You can, but for me I'm not good at it, and it comes off sounding dumb.<br>
<br>
For those who were curious about how to roleplay I hope that helps.  There are folks out there who are way better than I to roleplay, perhaps others will share thier roleplay tips.<br>
<br>
Roleplay isn't for everyone, as can bee seen by some other people's posts.  But for some of us, it makes the game even more enjoyable. <p>Salura Ater'Mors<br>

We spent about 45 minutes the other night taunting our best warrior.<br>

A druid told him he was just cruising through UP when he heard some guys talking about fighting that idiot Faelcoon and what a real clutz of a warrior he was.<br>

As far as guild chat, I suppose we could make up that when you join a guild, they give you a specific Guild Stone that is attuned to all others like it, making cross-continent communication viable. <br>
