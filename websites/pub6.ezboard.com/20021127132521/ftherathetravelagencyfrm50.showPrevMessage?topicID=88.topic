-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The bluster of shouts and other clamor were what was to be expected of such of a high traffic area. Shouts of people selling ware's filled Merkur's elven ears until he thought that they would bleed. He hated being in this area, this Bazaar of trade, as it was, he could rember being in the old trader halls of his long missed compatriot &quot;shady&quot; and the tunnels he caretaked, and how happy he was in those days. <br>
<br>
&quot;When are they going to arrive?&quot; He asked a new friend, Tekk, a keeper of the paths, &quot;I hope that everything goes well when they do.&quot; The tracker just shruged, unknowingly.<br>
<br>
Mouthing a silent curse, Merkur made himself unseen from the eyes of thoes who were mundane. Making his way slowly over to the place where they were to meet, he passed many a guard, with lighter pockets, of course. There he waited, putting himself into a meditative state that his Guild leader in Neriak, Tani N'Mar, had taught him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail, Merkur!&quot; somone said. Merkur slowy opened his eyes to peer out at a wizard, who went by the name of Laladwen. Cursing himself for being suprised so, he greeted Lala heatingly, keeping a cautious eye upon the imp he called a a pet. <br>
<br>
Over the next hour, more of his friends arrived, including somone he had met earlier upon his travels, a keeper of the paths named Vanskelleren. Merkur exlplained to his friends what they were going to do. His friends listened closely to the instructions of the upcoming battle, a quest even, one he had heard of from the bards of the world, one where the rewards for success would outweigh the price for faluire. When all was prepared, Merkur said a silent curse to Innorukk, praying that his hatefull eyes would not be upon them today, cursing their mission.<br>
<br>
After finnaly finishing thier instuctions, the people of the dragon, as the called themselves, followed Merkur upon one of his favorite things to do, scout. He lead them past the illusionary walls of the rogue guild in the town of Shadowhaven, a trick that the thiefs of the world learned to do century's ago, it's orgins lost within the strands of time.<br>
<br>
The People of the Dragon followed him through the dangerous caverns of Echo Caverns, around living plantlife and vengfull creatures. Going through the caverns unscathed, Merkur.gained hope that Innoruk had turned his vengfull eyes from them, terrorizing another dark elf this day. Showing his companions past the impassive guards of the outpost in The Fungus Grove and into the main cavern. Leading them through the village of cavemen, and to the Callers of the Biesties, made famous by travellers he had met througout his travels, and then into the caverns where this battle would begin. <br>
<br>
Merkur explained once everyone was there, what he was going to do, and how this quest was going to take place, once again. He then traveled back to the callers and gave him the bottle blargwrot that the caller wanted in order to call the biestes that he so lovingly craved to bring. Merkur spit in disgust at having to be in the presence of the caveman longer than he had to be. He ran back to his compainions once again to tell them which one of tunnels the caller was going too. The caller came, while Merkur tried to hold his bile from spewing upon the cavern walls from being in an enclosed place with this waste of skin caveman. <br>
<br>
The caveman Groo called of in his unintellectual tounge of his, &quot;Magic words&quot; Merkur wispered, looking at the pitiful creature, he felt a hatred so stong, one he knew that came from his god. Great he thought to himself, maybe today is going to be a good day to die...<br>
<br>
After a long fierce struggle, leaving 3 of his companions slain at the hands of the Biesties. Still, Merkur thought to himself, at least I have what I came for. Folding the Tiny Cloak of the Darkest Night into one of the hidden pouches that he carried on himself at all times. He felt a loss for his friends, but knew that eventually all would be right. <br>
<br>
&quot;We need to rescue their bodies, you know,&quot; Merkurs long time friend, an Enchatress of unparalled skill, Azmodainia, said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, one of the Keepers of the Paths are handling it now, but,&quot; he murmerd to himself, &quot;I will see if I can help, the least I could do for them.&quot; He grinned evilly.<br>
<br>
Merkur silently crept back into the village of the cavemen, his disgust barely disguised. Making his way back into the caves, an eeire silence filling up the bloodstained caverns, Merkur didn't even bother to sneak along the walls of the cavern, his hatred for the filth around him making him ignorant of the eyes upon him, watching from the darkness. <br>
<br>
A soft footfall was all Merkur had time to hear. Drawing out his daggers just in time to block the first claw swipe, he stared at the horde of biesties in front of him, the blood and entrails of his friends dripping from their mouths. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, maybe today is a good day to die after all,&quot; Merkur laughed at how his god had decived him, all this time, making his hatred too stong to notice the bloody hoof marks on the ground, or the haggard breathing of his enemies, or the scent of blood, one he knew all to well.<br>
<br>
Who would have know, the lord of hate had a sense of humor after all, he thought, as the horde decended upon him, one last time...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The eeire melody of Leowen's flute carried off into the far ceiling of the Nexus, leaving a trail of silence around The People of the Dragon, as they listened to his story.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ha, you aren't going to end there bard,&quot; his companion Hurb said,&quot; what about the resurections, and the further adventures?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, no...the rest is a story for another day, friends,&quot; Leowen wispered to his compainions, winking at them, &quot;another day indead...&quot;<br>
<br>
They say that the last notes of the song still trail on somtimes, from the Nexus, and every transport leaving from there, brings the story of adventure all across Norrath...  <p><center>
