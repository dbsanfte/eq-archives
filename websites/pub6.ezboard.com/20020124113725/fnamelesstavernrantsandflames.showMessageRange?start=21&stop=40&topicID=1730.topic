You only need one fluff buff if you recast it when it is dispelled.<br>

I think I'll just save myself a headache and not bring Atensen, just Ereb.

ps.  Nice fucking backup you had for the raid, is another power outage going to occur this time and stop the raid dead in its tracks as well?  I've got a low opinion of your leadership at this point after attending your first raid where you went LD how many times?  Including right during the Vox rush itself so you didn't end up in any danger.  You also looted her prior to anybody else while not grouped b/c you had just come back from LD, thats fucking suspicious. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udacrazycook.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DaCrazyCook</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 255<br> <font color=#333333>(10/29/01 8:29:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1730.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> ^^ Also CT likes to have those type of requirements so we don't lose to Vox...Shrug, we get enough people to meet the requirements, so we win.

<br>
Hah, I assume you have a very good internet connection if you can really do that right when your buff is dispelled. For those of us with 56k or worse, the battle lag during a fight like that can be about 30 seconds behind... kinda hard to rebuff right after you are dispelled when you see everything 30 seconds later, isn't it? That doesn't work bro, not everybody can get / afford any better than a dial-up. <br>

<br>
You do that. Not sure exactly what you mean by &quot;poorly formed group&quot; but on that last one I didn't even form the groups, since Julik covered for me while I was LD. I had no control over that. Oh... and 2-3 people were killed during that fight, not exactly  a &quot;group dying around&quot; you. <br>
<br>

<br>
Hrmm lets see, ever think about the fact that you had absolutely nothing to do with the organization of the raid, so there is no reason you WOULD know who was late and who wasn't unless you paid really close attention? I was there at least an hour AFTER the raid was scheduled to start, before I went LD. We were still waiting for a couple late arrivals when I LDed and Julik took over.<br>
<br>

<br>
Julik was my backup leader, I don't know what he did after I LDed but he is an experienced Vox raider (6 wins in 6 raids he's led) and I trusted him to take over and do what was needed.<br>
<br>
Power outage is sorta outta my hands. There was no way to know that would happen. If you can tell me a guaranteed way to see the future, I'm all ears... no, nevermind... I would probably laugh at you.<br>

<br>
Again, I have no control over that. I have a shitty 56k internet connection and DSL / Cable or better aren't offered in my area, so I really have no choice. I went LD twice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Including right during the Vox rush itself so you didn't end up in any danger&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, no control. 40 people attacking one mob = lots of lag and lots of LDs for the unfortunate people with crap connections. I was there through at least half of the fight, then when the nukes started I was disconnected. But FYI, your player stays ingame an entire minute after going LD, and he can still be hurt as if you were still connected.<br>
<br>
If you are trying to say I purposely /q'ed out to save myself a death... well no, that would be stupid of me. <br>
<br>
A. Not only can I still be hurt after LD but I get removed from my group which puts me in greater danger because clerics can't target me as easily.<br>
<br>
 B. I had a 56 cleric on rezzes, not much loss for anybody who died. <br>
<br>
C. The Vox fight itself is the only fun part of the raid, I would never intentionally miss one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;You also looted her prior to anybody else while not grouped b/c you had just come back from LD, thats fucking suspicious. &quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Just plain talking out of your ass here. You have absolutely no idea who looted it first, unless of course it was you. By the time I got back to loot it, somebody (I forget the name) was already holding the corpse for me. I rejoined my group right (now led by Ironn) immediately when I returned. Vox dropped 4 items, same number she has dropped on all 6 vox raids I have been on. We rolled on all of them, I lost on the only one I rolled for (the bag) which went to Thraksor. <br>
<br>
Don't try to play God and pretend you know everything that happened behind the scenes. Because quite obviously you don't have a clue what your talking about.<br>
<br>
Don't bother bringing Ereb either, for that matter. You aren't coming.<br>

As far as what you say about internet connections, thats BS.  I have played on raids with a 28.8 &amp; a cable modem.  Very little difference.<br>
<br>
I know my shit about raids.  I've been raiding longer than you have been around more than likely.<br>
<br>
I am pissed b/c your fucking raid took way too long.  I was attentive to when people were showing up and in what numbers and what classes.  As well as inspecting people and checking out their resist gears.<br>

Julik was 2nd in command and did fine until Baelinn returned from being LD.. and a power outage is not something many people are prepared for..<br>

point taken on the insta buff item..  i could possibly use it to protect an important buff, if i cast it at the cast it at the right moment or just cast it periodically..<br>

The most i have ever had die on one of my raids was 3 or 4 people max.. the only reason anyone died this raid was because the chanters didn't get Her tapped fast enough so the fight lasted longer.  Also i looked at the corpse while Baelinn was LD and i took a SS of the loot and if you have ANY suspision that I or Baelinn Ninja Looted anything (Yes i was ungrouped)  THen i will upload the picture and show it to everyone to clear this up.  None of my raids did i ever Ninja Loot anything nor did i even Claim anyloot.. matter of fact only one of my raids did i ever get loot..  Don't bring that crap in here.. he did not expect a power outage.. neither did i... i was just there to Help with Giants and show people how to saftly pull them.. When he was LD for 10 mins i figured something was wrong so i made groups... The raid in total took about 3 hours.. normal for a Vox raid .. they are much more complicated than Naggy.<br>

They are both GREAT guys...especially Jul.  I have known him for like 9 months Rl time now and if he did anything like that on a raid he helped lead that would betray everything he has ever done and that's not the kind of person he is.  As for the leadership thing, Baelinn was there for most, if not all, of Jul and my raids, and he asked me some very good questions while we were doing it, so i know he learned a lot and i am sure he is quite capable of leading a raid...thus why i sign up to go.  Finally, having a shitty connection does make a difference, especially if you don't have a really nice comp.  Yea you might have been able to handle a large scale fight on a 28.8...as long as your CPU could keep up it doesn't really matter what speed your on, but if you are having lots of lag from a bad ISP, + massive video lag, teh CPU just says fuck you and shuts off if your's isn't a good one...believe me i know.  So the multiple LD thing is nothing that should be talked about except for people looking ot kick up shit.  BTW...you know there's a patch tomorrow right? <p>Shenlon Flamingfists

Before this raid i was only around you one time atensen but you seemed cool enough.. but to come out and flame someone's raiding tactics after they WON is in poor taste.<br>

EDIT:  Oh and the reason we were there so long before we started buffing... We had to clear all the giants and make groups and i had to teach other people how to saftly pull the giatns out of Vox's Lair.. THen have thier corpse dragged when he died the first time.. and had to have someone dragged that went in for some reason and fell in a pit (Thanks Tyious)..

<br>
Well, if you had been playing EQ for more than 2 hours or so, you would probably be able to identify that &quot;5th loot item&quot; as research Words or Pages. It's friggin RESEARCH stuff, and not &quot;loot&quot;. My guess is that Baelinn either destroyed this item immediately after looting, or left it on the corpse so it wouldn't disappear before people got some screenshots of it.<br>
<br>
Vox dropped 4 items worthy of mention, not 5, and if you are any kind of experienced EQ player you know this so STFU!<br>
