Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> Ahhh but Nulin, your very argument proves my point. All that is required for a rotation to be set up is that 2 guilds or alliances that have managed to kill that mob ask for it to be on rotation. That is all that is needed. If Behemoth or Terris Thule were truly desirable to the people who could kill htem, they would already be on rotation by virtue of 2 guilds having asked for them to be so. My argument that it will work itself out one way or the other is still valid. <p>Venerable Korwynn Nitewing<br>

With 6 people you can be relatively sure on who is getting in why. With 72 (12 full groups) you can never be sure who got in, or if they are truly ready for the zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
So now the RTA is in charge of validating any person who gets flagged?<br>
<br>
So you are now bouncers at the doorway of PoP zones eh?<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me look at your credentials - No, I'm sorry, the current members of this zone don't feel you qualify to join our elite group.  Please know your role and play in the Velious and Luclin sandbox please&quot;<br>
<br>
This would be fine if you were the owners of the club.  Then you have the right to let what clients you want in.  You are not the owners though.<br>
<br>
This is the same with EVERY zone.  Were you at the entrance of Velks or Sebilis making sure that everyone was 52+ that entered the zone?  No, you weren't.  You just didn't group with them.  So just do the same here.  This is a social game.  You can't get away from that fact.  Just because this zone happens to have less xp spots then Velks or Sebilis doesn't alter that fact.  You simply don't have the right to tell people where they can xp in.<br>
<br>
Now I know AD has some pretty good loot.  But an inter-guild team of 72 peeps is not going to perma-kill AD so they can then decide between the 72 peeps, made up of two/three different guilds, on what two people get the loot. That is plain stupid to think that.  The only reason they would team up is so as many people from their guilds can get flagged for another xp zone. That doesn't mean that they all will perma camp in the zone.  A level 58 is not all of a sudden (just because he got flagged) going to start soloing and screwing up the zone.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Here is a good tip - Just because a person is not in an elite guild doesn't automatically make them stupid</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  But it will allow the higher members of a mid-tier guild (That is not strong enough of a guild to kill AD) to then have access to the zone.  I know that there is an individual (and actually group quest now) to get into the zone, but flagging 3-4 people at a time after doing that quest does not equate to flagging 40 of your guild in one fell swoop.  <br>

<br>
Ok, we all agree that AD is not a rotation mob correct? (This is a yes or no question only)<br>
<br>
If as I suspect the answer is at this time (and the time that the mob was taken down) is NO, it is not a rotation mob. Then the &quot;No Teaming Rule&quot; does not apply. Its that simple.<br>
<br>
The No Teaming Rule as has been said many times, applies to rotation mobs only.<br>
<br>
If AD is being considered for Rotation, make up your minds and either put the blasted mob on it or not.<br>
<br>
Allowing teaming here does not allow for teaming on Rotational Mobs, we have not disagreed with you here, bases on what I get from the posts here, we don't have a problem with the no teaming rule on the rotational mobs, we can live with that, its been stated.<br>
<br>
Here is a question. <br>
Who EXACTLY has access to this RTA channel?<br>
I know the Admins do, but who else? Heck I don't know who all the admins are honestly... I know Rog is, but that is the only name I know.<br>
<br>
What would happen if say, several of the smaller guilds go together and killed this Mob, none of us being posting entities or on the rotations. How would we know it was against the rules sense we don't have access to the RTA channel to see how the ... don't have a proper word for it....I'll just use RTA admin for it... How would the RTA admin (meaning the people who have access to the channel) handle this?  The groups that don't have access to you can't ask you so what can you do?<br>
<br>
No one seems to want to solve this issue, all the &quot;larger guilds&quot; want to do is say no teaming on any mob.    And yes that is pretty much what you are saying.   And you are using the &quot;rotation rules&quot; as your backup.   This is completely insane becuase the npcs your complaining about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ARE NOT ON ROTATION.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->    I am still wondering why the hell people are still bringing up the rotation mobs as a reason not to allow teaming.<br>

Some are whining about wanting to XP in the elementals, well a link will be posted below to show HOW you get into the elementals.  Basically, your guild (your freaking team) needs to kill ALL those the gods and dragons.  Than you get into the elementals.  My problem is how people cry that they need to team up a bunch of people to kill these mobs, isn't that what the hell your guild is for, isn't your guild a &quot;TEAM&quot;, if ya can't kill it, than recruit more, farm more of the content you can kill to gear up and kill these mobs.  If you have an alliance have you considered merging, many guilds have and been very successful since.  Silver Blade and Noble House were an alliance, and now are one guild.  This happens on all servers across the board, guilds merge, they get better or they disolve, depending on the dedication to the game.  Looking at this flow chart, the casuial gamer will never see elementals.  <br>
And sprigg regarding yer 3 little examples on mob desirability, Sont was downed on sunday by NB and AD's loot was posted, by me, a few pages back with direct VT loot comparisons, check it out, AD drops nice shit.<br>

And as we have said... this opens up a nasty can of worms... over and over and over again.  We understand what you are saying... completely.   I have only seen two people who say that they even have the slightest understanding of what we have been talking about.<br>
<br>
If you are saying that the only difference between AD and RZtW is that people want the items, your argument is, well, quite naive.  What prevents these folks who like teaming so much to start teaming on RZtW if everyone says it is OK on AD?  If you are saying &quot;trust us&quot;, well, to be honest, I don't and so far, no one arguing the benefits of teaming has said or done anything to convince me to trust them.  The only argument I've heard is &quot;we want in and we want in NOW!  gimme ph4t lewtz!&quot;.  Have you ever heard of &quot;slippery slopes&quot;?

This sentiment is certainly not a one way street.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have stated in two or three posts why I feel AD should not be a rotation mob - I have set reasons that I feel are valid.  <br>
<br>
You simply don't agree.  That in no way invalidates those reasons.<br>

<br>
The problem is that MOST of us are talking about teaming up on ONLY THREE mobs that are not rotation mobs.<br>
<br>
What you and a handful of others are doing is addressing a topic that is not part of the discussion.<br>
<br>
It seems logical, given the server's past that guilds will continue to respect rotations.  So if RZtW is on a ROTATION then people cannot kill him as an alliance without botching ALL of their rotations, thus they will not do it.<br>
<br>
You are acting like it is *not possible* to differentiate between mobs that are not currently on rotation with mobs that are.  You are also implying that guilds cooperating on NON rotation mobs could lead to guilds cooperating on ROTATION mobs, which would explicitly be against the rules.<br>
<br>
On one side we have people NOT breaking rules, and helping each other.  On the other hand there is BREAKING the rules and two guilds losing all of their rotations.  The two scenarios are QUITE different.<br>
<br>
So once more:<br>
<br>
1.  AD, Grummus, Behemoth are not currently rotation mobs.<br>
2.  By teaming on them, nobody has broken any rules.<br>
3.  Guilds may NOT team on rotations mobs without suffering the consequence of forming an alliance on rotations.<br>
<br>
I feel like that is easy enough for everyone to understand.  Drop the paranoia, or whatever it is that leads to your inability to &quot;trust&quot; people.  You have every right to worry about people breaking established rules, but that hasn't happened here.<br>
<br>
Here's a small comparision:  I can drive a car. I can also drive a car down a road where pedestrians cross frequently.  Just because pedestrians cross my path, doesn't mean I am going to run them over.  If I DO run them over, it is against the law, and I suffer consequences.<br>
<br>
Same thing here.  I can fight mobs.  I can fight non-rotation mobs with as many people, from as many guilds as I want.  Just because I team up on non-rotation mobs doesn't mean I will team up on rotation mobs.  If I team up on rotation mobs, I have broken the rules and will suffer the consequences.<br>
<br>
Once more:  What is the problem?<br>

<br>
Let me break this down so it is very specific for your feeble mind.<br>
<br>
-People have stated that they were after more exp spots, thus the reason for teaming, and the loot.<br>
-It is pretty much common knowledge that the ele planes offer better exp than HoH and Tactics and way better loot than anywhere else in the game.<br>
-People(specifically those of the &quot;higher&quot; guilds) are concerned over the teaming and or are not pleased with it yet the &quot;lower&quot; guilds seem to not care.<br>
<br>
Now...<br>
<br>
When we combine these facts, alongside the ability for even more guilds to team up for any mob, it's relatively safe to assume that since a combination of rallos, agnarr, mithaniel, bertox, etc... offer up access to the best exp and loot in the game (the reasons for teaming on AD, who drops inferior loot and grants access to an inferior exp zone) that teaming guilds would just say the hell with this, and drop rallos with many people.  <br>
<br>
They would have no more need for any mobs outside of the elementals once doing so, because 95%(100%?) of all outside loot is inferior to what drops in the eles.  Why worry about getting kicked off of rots by the RTA then?  Why would the &quot;lower&quot; guilds suddenly worry about the RTA, considering the &quot;lower&quot; guilds have shown the ability to not really care how the &quot;higher&quot; guilds react?<br>
<br>
Again... you're stating that simply because RZ is a rot mob and that AD is not that you would leave RZ alone?  That's pretty weak, in my opinion only, at best.<br>
<br>
Admittedly my entire idea is based on an assumption that the &quot;lower&quot; guilds would just say &quot;fuck it&quot;, but now you may understand my reasoning behind it.<br>
<br>
And let me just say, while I love the PoP flagging system instead of having to camp keys, I blame Verant(SoE) for this.  This is really only an issue because of the amount of &quot;instant&quot; keys offered up when a mob is killed.  If you had to quest for keys to access the elementals along the lines of the difficulty/longness of the VT key, this would less serious of an issue. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shogonramel>Shogon Ramel</A> at: 4/16/03 11:36:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nyca>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Singing Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 1571<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/16/03 12:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=274>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/slllyonec/EZemo/LeahHarp2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> So your contention is that if a mob can have a quest, it can be &quot;teamed&quot;. <br>
<br>
BUT.. and this is the sticking point.. what is to prevent anyone from &quot;teaming&quot; on the next tier? And the next?<br>
<br>
The &quot;smaller&quot; guilds are saying &quot;hooray&quot; for Rotations when it pleases them, as it gives their guilds (or established alliances) shots at mobs that otherwise they'd never see. <br>
<br>
But now they are saying, basically, &quot;the hell with you, we want to do what WE want&quot;. <br>
<br>
It's not about the loot these mobs (AD, Grummus) drop, it's about the &quot;soul of the Rathe&quot;, which has always meant we have a Rotational Server, and all that implies. What it implies is that the 'big' guilds given up some of their &quot;rights&quot; (kill a mob whenever it surfaces), to gain something. What is that something? Up to now, nothing. Now, all that the &quot;big&quot; guilds want is to continue that tradition. Not to &quot;team up&quot; on Flag Mobs.

No thats where the difference is, we will see it by doing the quest. <br>
No one would complain if people started teaming up for Sont.<br>
<br>
I can not see harm coming to the elemental planes if only questable flag mobs only are kept ffa.  If a flag is NOT questable, but only able to be gotten by a kill, make it a rule that it is non teamable. I feel this would suit all concerned.<br>

<br>
I think you are missing what I said.  I said the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SPIRIT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the rotation system.  Since most people seem to be missing what that means let's use a few examples.<br>
<br>
BotS currently has a guild for both alts and friends called Baby Spiers.  Hypothetically speaking some of us don't all get along 100% and what not, so we have decided to make a number of smaller guilds.  These smaller guilds will house both alts of certain BotS members plus friends of those members.  The new guilds will be called the following:<br>
-Baby Spiders<br>
-Mini Spider<br>
-Junior Spiders<br>
-Lowbie Spiders<br>
-Teenage Mutant Ninja Spiders<br>
<br>
We will slowly be gearing up our friends in their respective guilds and would like 5 rotations on all mobs that they can kill.  We anicipate this to include but not be limited to the following:  Trak, AoW, KT, Sev, Greig, Dozekar, Cazic Thule, Zlandicar and Klandicar.  We anticipate them entering these rotations within the next cycle.<br>
<br>
See how ludicrous this becomes?  This violates the SPIRIT of the rotation system.  Although by the letter of the law it would not be violating the RTA rules, that does not make it any more valid.  That is the point here that I think most people are continually missing.  The point is you want to pick and choose when and where you start teaming up on boss mob encounters.  No one ever said you &quot;CAN'T&quot; team.  What they did say was fine team, but merge ALL you rotations when you decide to start teaming.  <br>
<br>
All this talk about holding people down is nothing more than wanting your cake and eating it too.  We want to get as much loot as we can, as many keys as we can, as many flags as we can for our guild no matter how we do it.  You talk about the greed of uber guilds wanting to hold mid to lower tier guilds down?  I argue the it is those same guilds wanting to ask guilds who on a whim could easily gank such targets to not do so.  Then on the other hand try to get into as much of that loot, keys flags as they can for themselves.  Perhpas here is a good illustration:<br>
<br>
Meduim Guild:<br>
They are a guild of about 50 hard core players who often have around 40 online at peak hours.<br>
<br>
They kill 3 mobs<br>
mob_A - this takes them about half their hardcore members to kill, they often have done it with as few as 4 groups or about 22 people.  They often know when he is up and could kill him pretty much upon respawn if they so choose to.  He has 2 decent loot drops that is currenlty working it's way through their lower ranks.<br>
mob_B - this takes them about 2/3 their hardcore members to kill, they often have done it with as few as 5 full groups or 30 people.  They usually know when he is up and could kill him pretty much upon a few hours of respawn if they so choose to.  He has 2 above average loots that are currently going to upper level and mid rank members.<br>
mob_C - This takes them all of their all to do.  He is an uber mob and has great loot, but they need 45+ people to turn out or they just can't do it.  They are fortunate to be able to kill this mob.  He drops excellent loot and only their top ranks are seeing it at this time.<br>
<br>
Small Medium Guild_01 (SMG1)<br>
They are a guild of about 30 hard core players.  Who often have around 25 members on at peak hours.  When raids are scheduled almsot all their hard core members are there as well as some of their more casual players.  Full raid force usually consists of about 40 at max.<br>
<br>
They Kill 2 mobs:<br>
mob_A. - This mob they have down pat now.  It used to take them all they could get online, but after a few times they really have a good strategy down.  They have often done it with as few as 25 at the raid.  They usually plan for this event and let all their members know when the upcoming spawn is to ensure that they have the numbers they need to kill him.  Currently loot is going to the top and mid level ranks in the guild.<br>
mob_B - This mob they are very fortunate to be able to kill.  Medium Guild above gave them a shot at it a few months ago.  They had all their hard core members on and most of their casual members.  They had a bulk raid force of 45 players for this raid and are in the rotation for it.  Currently all loot is goign to top end ranks in the guild only.<br>
mob_C - Well they have tried this mob a few times, but right now it is beyond them to able to do it because of numbers, levels and gear, but they hope to be able to kill him one day.<br>
<br>
Small Medium Guild_02 (SMG2)<br>
They are nearly identical to Small Medium Guild_01.  They are on the same rotations, and have the same aspirations of killing mob_C.  They also however suffer the same logistcal problems that they have serious difficulties dropping mob_B unless all their members know when he is spawning and they have all their hard core members there plus a good many of their more casual players there to ensure success.<br>
<br>
Small Medium Guild ( 01 and 02) decide to team up on mob_C and share the loot between them since they can't take him on alone yet, they know combined they could do it.  They decide to kill him as one entity for only mob_C and ask to remain seperate rotations on mobs A &amp; B.<br>
<br>
Please tell me you now don't see the hypocrisy of this?  The larger guild in theis scenario could easily be ganking mob_A everytime it spawned, and mob_B within a few hours of spawning.  HOWEVER they graciously decide to put their greedy ways aside and let BOTH Small Medium Guilds have a fair equal unhindered shot at those mobs.  The understanding is that these guilds won't abuse that goodwill.  Herein lies the abuse.  SMG 01 and 02 now want a rotation on mob_C, but seperate rotations on mobs A &amp; B.<br>
<br>
Honestly I can't see how this strikes anyone as fair, and I tihnk most would agree it is not fair.  Per rotation cycle they are getting 2 lower level loots, 2 medium type loots and 2 uber type loots.  They still have plenty of members who could use alot more of those 2 lower level and medium type loots.<br>
<br>
Here is the reason it is not fair:<br>
Quite frankly they would like to perma farm mob_A for about 2 or 3 months and be done with him.  However since they are fairly rotating this mob it will take them around 6-9 months to finish up with Mob_A and possibly 1-2 years to finish up with mob_B.  At the same time they are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>delaying their own progress</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, you are now asking them to further delay it to cater to both SMG's?  If both SMG's want to ally that is A-O-K, so long as they now merge their alliance on both mobs_A&amp;B as well.  In that way, although the larger guild is now also slowed down in their progression through mob C, at least they have speeded up their progression on mobs A &amp; B.<br>
<br>
Therein lies the *SPIRIT* of the system.  Larger guilds delay their progress on certain mobs so that all have a fair shot at it.  The *SPIRIT* is about progression.<br>
<br>
I would like to ask how far do you think teaming up on progression would be logical and fair?<br>

That right there is what the heart of the issue is all about.  Everyone wants to draw the line at different places.  Some say AD, some think the Elemental planes.  So then what?  You team on all boss mobs up to Rallos Zek (RZ) because you are only &quot;after xp&quot;, to get past RZ to &quot;xp&quot; in the elemental planes and find that some min's there are actually not quite as hard as RZ.  Then some guilds decide hey our guild can kill said mini boss on our own, we want to rotate this mob and kill it on a regular basis.  I call foul!  The means by which you even accessed the content was one of teaming, however now you want 2 rotations on Blizzak because he is eaiser for you to do than RZ?  These guilds then start looking to the 3 other elemental planes as well?  <br>
<br>
Where should you draw the line to prevent it BEFORE it gets to this stage?  At the start of the whole road is the best place to raise such objections, rather than when faced with this exact scenario.  On other servers they have raids of 400 people to kill RZ.  There was a reason sony implemented the 72 flag rule.  I would much rather, and I am sure if you were honest you would to, that objections are raised at the start of this issue rather than half way through.  If not I can hear it already..... &quot;Well you didn't say anything when we killed AD so what is the big deal now?&quot;<br>
<br>
If no one believes in the *SPIRIT* of the rotations, IE only the letter of the law should apply, I am certain you will have no problems with members from BotS, Tindi, NB, etc... ganking 2 and 3 sxpansion old content on a whim.  They will hang their heads and take the shame of the community and skip this rot and the next rot as due punishment, for rots that they are not even on.  See the letter of the law is followed here as well, however I am sure it just doesn't seem fair when the shoe is on the other foot. <p>Soneya<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

If it were only the 3 mobs that could be quested past, I would be willing to agree with you.  However, if the big guilds agree to this today, what stops the smaller guilds from coming back in 3 months time and bitching about how the big guilds are opressing them by not allowing them to team up on the next level mob?<br>
<br>
If however, we can agree on a rule at this time that states only these three mobs, that have alternative quests, can ever be teamed up on then we might be able to come to an agreement. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emilsinclair>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GL-BoTS</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/16/03 7:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=278>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> if it can be quested, then why not just do the quest? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/view.php?Emil" target="top">Emil Sinclair</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, 65th Monk<br>

I got an idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  since it only takes a two guilds to agree on a rotation right?  Well shucks, I r dah stoopid one, we could have solved this ages ago.  Why don't TL, NB and BoTS agree to a rotation on these flagging mobs?  <br>
<br>
After we get alt9753 flagged we could just auto pass on them like we all do for Grieg Veneficus, Dain and countless others.  <br>
<br>
Plus no matter what we do or how fair we try to be, we're always going to be accused of holding the entire server down.    <br>
<br>
WOOOO HOOOOOOOO problem solved, no more having to listen to the arguments of &quot;XYZ mob isn't on a rotation&quot; right?<br>

Posted WAY back on page 9 ...put your money where your mouth is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Concerning Aerin Dar, Grummus, Behemoth:<br>
a) Because the mob the trigger for recieving 72 keys everytime to grant access to another zone,<br>
b) Because you can also quest a key to give access to this same other zone,<br>
c) Because the flag is the primary focus and the tangible items that the mob drops are of no primary consequence to anyone,<br>
d) As evidence of a), b), and c) there has been no contention for this mob as of yet as evidenced by the fact that this mob has been left alive for periods often greater than 72 hours,<br>
e) Then the mob doesn't require rotation and, therefore, no rules, which allow teaming up on the mob in any form desired.<br>
f) However, it may be in the future that a rotation needs to be in effect on this mob, if contention increases to the point some guild/group requests it.<br>
g) in distinction of item b), should this mob be placed on rotation, a further exemption will be set forth allowing an alliance of guilds to team up on this mob only for the purpose of receiving their flag; however, any further attempts on this mob for the purpose of additional flagging or for purposes of loot must be accomplished by that alliance as one rotation entity.<br>
h) following current alliance policy, any break up of an alliance will result in the alliance being removed from the rotation, and each guild must each kill the mob separately to be placed back on the rotation.<br>
<br>
Then, this can be similarly applied (or inherited if you like) by any other mob having similar properties in the future.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I refuse to argue this point any further.  I'm only posting this as proof that an attempt at a 'reasonable' compromise has been submitted ...and ignored. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
