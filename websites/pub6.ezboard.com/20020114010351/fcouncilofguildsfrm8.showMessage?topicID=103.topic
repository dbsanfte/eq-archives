A number of successful (and some not so successful) planes raids. A great chess tournament put on by Pippi, a Valentine's Dance. Some good Mixer raids put on by Stonescale and the Peacekeepers. All in all, it's been a good year in 2001, and it followed the successes of the KCoG in 2000. We have a number of people who are excited and dedicated to bringing more events to the CoG. <br>
<br>
It's been a good run. Now, I must announce that the Sacred Band alliance, consisting of the Silver Daggers, Illuminatus, Fell Omen and Storm's Justice, is passing on its leadership of KCoG Dragons and planes raids. I've pondered this decision long and hard, and discussed it with members of my guild and the leaders of the Sacred Band alliance. When we first decided to take up the responsibility of leading CoG planes and dragon raids, we knew that eventually, we'd get large enough and practiced enough to do these raids on our own. While providing the service of leading and organizing the raids for the CoG, it was always in the back of our minds that we would eventually have to do these raids on our own. We would get enough members that we'd either take up too many spots from the CoG, or have to turn our own members away from raids. At first, this wasn't a problem, but it has become increasingly apparent that we are at that stage. To be fair to my own guild and my allies, I have to take us to the next level. <br>
<br>
I have contacted some raid leader candidates out there, to see if they will take the mantle of CoG raid leadership on their own, until their own guild/alliance is ready. I would very much like to see these events continue for those guilds out there that are not able to do them on their own, or are not in an alliance. Anyone that is a Council guild that wishes to take up this job, please email me at haemish@mail.com and I'll help you as much as I can. There are some qualifications you'll need to have in order to lead these things, the primary one being adherance to the ideals in the CoG vision. <br>
<br>
This past Sunday's Vox raid was the last Sacred Band-led Dragon raid, and this coming Sunday (April 15th's) Hate plane raid will be the last Sacred Band-led plane raid. I have not reserved a plane for next week for the CoG, as I need someone ready to lead the raids before I commit the CoG to another raid. I will be keeping the CoG in the KGC dragon rotations for a week or so, and if a leader has not appeared to lead the dragons raids by that time, I will pull them out until such time as they are led. I will remain a spokesperson for the CoG on the Karana Guild Central board. The Sacred Band will also continue to host events outside of these type of raids, though what form they will take isn't set (we could come up with another chess tourney, or a newbie tourney, or another walking tour). <br>
<br>
We've shown that with time, effort, organization, and discipline, these type of raids can be done by a loose confederation of guilds and individuals. The CoG can accomplish greater things if we keep at it. <br>
<br>
Long live the Karana Council of Guilds!<br>

<br>
I have a question to ask are you just giving up your responsiblities for leading large scale raids or stepping back from the day to day running of the council.<br>
<br>
If the former is the case then I hope we can find raid leaders who have the patience and ability that you guys always seem to show. I am just reaching the lvls when I can begin to really take advantage of the oportunities that the Council gives us and was very much looking forward to learning under the watchful eyes of the Sacred band. And I hope that once I reach the level of raiding ability that you guys show there will still be a fully active CoG for me to support.<br>
<br>
If the latter is true then I can only say that I feel this is a sad day for the CoG for I see the SB as the driving force behind the entire Council. Although you might not see it as such I certainly see you as the leader of the Council it is your grit, determination and passion which has brought the Council to where it is today and you are ably assisted by those who you have gathered around you. E.g. The Sacred Band.<br>
I only hope that there is someone out there with your guts and bravery to take on the postition which you are leaving. I know I couldn't.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you in all that you do.<br>

Haemish started up the CoG *cheers* and he relied on a lot of strangers to start up this server-wide community forum, including me (I met him through this, so there was one great thing I got out of this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ).  <br>
<br>
Especially Jzonn and Avending Crusaders and Zellex have done a lot of the plane raid organization in the beginning, so cheers to you if you are still reading this! <br>
<br>
We've also relied on other people in the early days of CoG for the mixer hunts such as Allied Giants, Seekers of Knowledge, Storm's Justice and some of my personal friends *cough* dragged along *cough* such as Pirmin and Kellmourn and Simarill and Bokk and Guinness and Fibban and Steelheart and Edina to come and help out or just to have fun.  Especially Kell and Pir have always been there for me, even last minute, to step up to whatever roles I still needed to fill *hugs*<br>
<br>
I know for a fact that I am not capable of mentioning every single person here, and there are soo many to thank for all the consistent turnout and the people who have stepped up recently to organize mixers ... may as well start a thank you thread here for anyone involved <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <p><HR>
<font size=2>An Alliance is...."in interguild relations, a formal agreement between two or more guilds for mutual support in case of war. An alliance provides for combined action on the part of two or more independent states and is usually defensive in form, since it obligates allies to join forces if one or more of them is attacked by another guild. Alliances are typically defined by a treaty, the most critical clauses of which are those that define the casus foederis, or the circumstances under which an ally becomes obligated to aid a fellow ally..." The Council of Guilds is not an alliance. Basta.</font>

I will still be involved in the CoG, still be the forum admin for the CoG forum, am still the CoG Web master, still keep track of the membership, etc. I'm still here to help anyone who wants to run any kind of event. <br>
<br>
I, and the Sacred Band alliance, are just stepping away from the leading of the Planes and dragon raids for the Council. I have some candidates in mind for taking our place, and I do hope that there are others I haven't thought of who would like to do this. And I am always available as a resource to help accomplish these goals. I have the infrastructure set up to accomplish dragon raids (i.e. the dragon raids mailing list), and I can still scan the KGC for warning when a dragon raid is coming. I just won't be leading the raids themselves, as the Sacred Band alliance is ready and anxious to do these types of raids on our own, with perhaps a few invited guests. <br>
<br>
And Pippi is right, there have been SOOO many people, both in the Sacred Band and in other guilds and alliances who have helped us out with this. I could never have gotten the CoG to this point without the help and dedication of everyone who has involved themselves. So long as there are people on the server willing to give up their time and effort to do events, the CoG will flourish. <br>
<br>
Just off the top of my head, I can thank Pippi, all the people Pippi thanked, Stonescale, Fayen, Zellex and Jzonn (cos they deserve a second mention), Minkey, Verius, Illuvatar, Dogedme, Guiness, Hooloovoo, Shoji, Cassia, Belce (for always being by my side in every meeting), Eleysian, Kailei, Saneldrin, Aeschelus, Shadex, Edina and the members of the Haven of Light, and a whole bunch of others whose names I might forget, but whose assistance I needed. <br>

There will be some minor changes in the way things are run, owing to a slightly different style of the FoF from the SB, but the best news is that the CoG will still be providing planes and dragon raids for those who are not otherwise able. Many of the members of this guild have participated in dragons and planes runs with myself and the other members of the Sacred Band, and they know how it is supposed to be done. Their philosophy coincides with the SB's philosophy and with the basic tenets of the CoG. <br>
<br>
Like the Sacred Band, they want to run these events not only to provide a means for their own people to reach the planes, but also for others who could not otherwise see the planes to do so as well. Like the Sacred Band, they intend to also use these events to train their own members in running planes raids so that they can one day do their own planes raids. When they are ready, I'd like to think they can pass on the mantle of leadership of these events to another guild or alliance, and I'd like to hear from anyone who wishes to run these events in the future after FoF. <br>
<br>
The only downside is that it will take them a few weeks to get organized and ready to do them. They are looking at running at least one plane event in early May, perhaps 2 in the same week (one of which will be a special event). Keep your eyes on this forum for details, as well as for the other great CoG events that are posted here. If a Dragon comes up between now and when they run a plane run, they will be going after it, so watch the dragon raid forum AND the mailing list. <br>
