address this now. I and my loot coordinator decided to restrict the lottos on this item to wisdom and intelligence casters only, after the loot had dropped. While I feel that restricting the lotto to casters only was right, I should have considered this beforehand and announced it. For surprising people with that, I apologize. <br><br>My reasoning behind restricting this item was this: I feel that a pure caster will benefit much more from this item than a hybrid. Pure and simple. While I know that rangers and paladins use wisdom items to increase their mana pool and shadowknights would use this for the same reason, casters are going to benefit more. Not only that, there are very few items for casters short of the planes that add +15 wis and +15 int. <br><br>I will not argue that there is any class that COULDN'T benefit from this. Warriors attempting to get their smithing skill up could use the int and wis bonuses. Anyone attempting to increase skills could use this item. Hybrids could use it to increase their mana pool. Casters could use it for all of these purposes. Any class could benefit from this item. And anyone could sell this item for something they can use better. <br><br>But I look at this item like I look at the Golden Efreeti boots or the Flowing Black Silk Sash (or the Cloak of Flames as well). If I were leading a GEB raid, or a Guk group that camped the FBSS, no melee would ever get to lotto on the GEB's UNLESS all casters there had a pair of boots, just like no Guk group I led would have casters lottoing on the FBSS unless all melee's there had a sash. Similarly, if I'm hunting in a group in the Great Divide and we kill a shardwurm, a spell drops, I would never (nor would I expect ANY melees in my group) to lotto for a spell that someone in the group could use, no matter how much I could sell it for. While that situation is a little more clear cut than the FBSS or GEB or Cloak of Flames or Torbin's Eyepatch, I feel it's in the same class.... NEED before greed. Certain items are needed more by certain classes than others. For the Cloak of Flames, melees need haste more than a caster (as well as the stat bonuses). For Torbin's Eye patch, casters need the stat bonuses it gives more than hybrids. <br><br>Not everyone will agree with me, and I don't expect them to. As a raid organizer, there are certain things you need to decide on, and stick to it, no matter who you might piss off. These items and who can use them is a fine line, and it's a line that the organizer has to decide to draw. Every organizer will draw it in a different place. In the same way as drawing the line on latecomers (when to cut off signups), or whether to summon a corpse or send someone to pull it, drawing a line on loot will not always be clear cut. I made my decision and I stick by it. If that decision is such that you do not want to attend raids I run in the future, I'm sorry to hear that, but it won't change my mind. If you feel it should be done differently, I welcome you to lead a raid of your own, and will support you at that, gladly coming along, sending out emails, posting press releases, whatever you need. And if the eyepatch drops and you open it to all/all, I'll roll on it, and if I win, probably give it to a caster in my guild. <br><br>I hope no one is so upset by my choice on this item that they won't attend future events run by me, as I think that would miss the whole point of why the CoG and myself in particular are doing events. And again, I apologize for surprising folks on this item, as it wasn't my intention. Future raids will have more detailed loot rules posted beforehand. <br><br>Haemish MacLennan<br>Clan Chieftan<br>The Silver Daggers <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uedinaelvander.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edina Elvander</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/4/01 1:16:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=69.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://constantine.free.fr/edinapic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torbin's Eye Patch - Who lottoed</span><hr size=1> Thank you for your post, Haemish.  Yes, it was quite a surprise when that was announced because it was contrary to the loot rules.  When rules start being changed at the last minute, it is cause for concern.  I understand the reasoning but consider the fact when you have hybrids who are asked to participate in the buffing line, their wisdom is equally important.<br><br>Sure, as a druid, it increased my chances of winning the eyepatch but that is not the point.  The point is fairness and communication.   If we are going to start determining who gets what based on suitability then  I think you have come up with a good solution.  Determine which class can roll for what before each raid, announce it ahead of time, then let people decide for themselves if they want to participate.  Yes, it's not about winning lottos but hunting with friends and making new friends, but also there is that rush people get when they think they have a chance at winning a nice item at the end of a successful raid. That's part of the fun too!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I personally like the idea that items are available to anyone who can use it.  I find that refreshing.  But if rules are going to be changed depending on the raid and the items dropped, then a provision has to be made for this in the rules. People take the rules literally.  Let them know up front what to expect.<br><br>We all learn something new with each raid to make the next one better and this is one of those lessons.  Haemish, I appreciate your candor and straightforward manner.  What I like in a leader is honesty, fairness and the ability to make a decision and stick to it and you have those traits.  <br><br>Edina Elvander<br>Level 51 Druid of Fury <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>Haven of Light<br><br>P.S.

I just felt like I had the rug pulled from under me since I thoroughly read the loot rules you posted and then at the end of a long and arduous raid the rules weren't being adhered to.  Was a disappointing surprise to me and maybe others.<br><br>As far as the &quot;Need before Greed&quot; policy...that is an individual call.  People play EQ for different reasons.  Some enjoy increasing all their trade skills.  By increasing their trade skills they can in turn increase their wealth.  By increasing their wealth they can buy items that they can use for raids, etc.  It may be a different path than most take but I don't think it's any less fun or admirable.  The eyepatch could help a person like this immensely.<br><br>Verant may, in fact, want to encourage that aspect of the game more.  I, as a ranger, want to increase my wisdom as much as I can.  Some rangers want nothing but AC and ignore their wisdom.  I don't.  As it is, the eyepatch is a better face item than I currently own.  It would've helped me a lot.  Please consider the big picture when it comes to changing what the game has set.  Your image of how the game should be played may directly conflict with someone elses.<br><br>I appreciate you posting an apology.  I'm in no way upset with you or how the raid went.  There were probably mistakes made but it was a success and it was fun.  I thank you for your attention to detail and concern for all who attended.<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Cretar <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/5/01 11:30:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=69.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torbin's Eye Patch - Who lottoed</span><hr size=1> As I said Cretar, I hate the fact that I surprised people with that one. My own naivete led me to think when I looked over the dragon loot that no one who wasn't a pure caster would want this item, so it never occured to me to announce it beforehand. And I'm not saying it couldn't be used by those who I restricted from lottoing on it, as it could. As a dumbbo warrior, I could use both the int and wis to increase my smithing, which could use the increase. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But I feel that if I were a caster, who really needed the int gear (or wis), and the lotto was won by a melee class, I'd feel cheated, much as if a melee won a spell drop. Granted it is a different type of thing (spell that Can't be used by the melee vs. an eyepatch that can be used), but I would feel no less that the patch went to someone not as well suited to it as I (were I the caster). Being that this was the only drop that a pure int caster could gain any use out of, I also felt better about restricting that one. <br><br>As I posted in the loot rules, no loot policy will ever be 100% fair. It's a fact of life that people will always feel that in some way, they got less than they deserved from the items that dropped, whether it be that no items they could use dropped (so they couldn't lotto) or an item they can't use was restricted. I try to be as fair as I know how, while also supporting the view I have of how the game should be played. Yes, I admit it... my loot policy is determined by how I think the game should be played. I don't think any raid commander out there should make a loot policy that DOESN'T agree with the way they think the game should be played. <br><br>My biggest regret is not announcing this change BEFORE the raid, as it did contradict what I'd said earlier. I'm sure I disappointed a good number of people, I just hope that I haven't turned those people off to going on raids led by me or events led by the Sacred Band or Council of Guilds. I would not change the decision given the chance, but I would change the timing and announcing of said decision. <br><br>Haemish MacLennan<br>Clan Chieftan<br>The Silver Daggers
