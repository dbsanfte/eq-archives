There seems to be some confusion over the 6 member per WHATEVER rule. This vote is the clarify that rule such that everyone understands the rule.<br>
<br>
Please chose one of the following:<br>
A)You can invite no more than 6 people from the same posting entity*, and as many people as you want from non-posting guilds.<br>
<br>
B)You can invite no more than 6 people from the same posting entity*. You can invite no more than 6 people from the same non-posting guild. <br>
<br>
*Posting entity refers to those guilds and alliances that meet the requirements to posts dates on the calendar, and have access to do so.<br>

<br>
Why limit invites from a non-posting entity. If I decide they are my ally then I can invite them all but if not I can only bring 6? Either way they cannot post alone so there is no potential for them to book double dates. If I am mistaken or missing something please someone clarify it for me.  <p>Verbalsabre

option a would permit non-posting guild to never attempt to become a posting entity and they could have all 20-25 of their members invited on any raid they wanted to instead of spreading the 'wealth' as it were around. (now that's a run-on!)<br>

<br>
 My guild has about 8 Planeable toons. According to the post above we will not aspire to become a posting entity because all 8 of us can go to the Planes with any one we want? My impression was that this rule existed not to &quot;spread the wealth&quot; but to insure more dates for everyone to reserve. If me and my 8 members go to Fear on 3 days in a row it was not because &quot;we&quot; wanted to but because we were invited by the guild that held that date. Any loot we receive would be taken away from the guild that posted. This does not tie up additional dates on the calander nor does it take loot away from anyone other then the guild that invited us, If they were unwilling to part with that then they should have either not invited us or they should make loot rules stateing that the invites get leftovers. <br>
<br>
I want to stress that I am not trying to buck the system or even argue against the rule, just trying to clarify the intent. I still do not see how a guild, such as mine, being in the planes every day effects anyone other then the posting guild. It is &quot;their&quot; day, if they want to give me their loot then so be it. I do understand the rules regarding posting entities because the piggy backing scenario will make everyone have to wait longer for open dates but for non-posting entities it does not seem to apply. Please correct me if I am wrong or missing something, After all I am just some &quot;Noob from some guild you have never heard of.&quot; (My favorite Mistabone quote) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
If you vote for A then, yes all 8 of your guild members could be invited to any raid.  B does limit your total number to 6 however.<br>
<br>
This rule seems unusual, but it was created because of the history of this calendar.  Intially, guilds could book dates every 2 to 3 weeks in each plane.  That worked perfect when there ere only 14-20 posting guilds.<br>
<br>
After Kunark, more and more players became planar level.  That lead to a situation that it could be 6-7 weeks between your guild events in each plane.  Many alliances that were once formed out of need began to break apart back into individual posting guilds.   This meant that twice as many guilds were now going to each plane AND they were inviting their old allies along.<br>
<br>
For example, an alliance of 30 players made of 3 guilds, would break into 3 guilds of 10.  Then they had 3 times the number of dates as when they were allied because they would invite their old allies to every raid.  Eventually, cover guilds of one player were made to reserve a date for another guild so they could get more time.<br>
<br>
Then came the 2/3rds rule.  Basically, it required that 66% of a raid had to be made of the posting group.  That would have been a good idea, but enforcement was impossible.  Guilds started taking as few invites as possible on raids, which let loot decay.  It hurt the unguilded and the very small guilds.<br>
<br>
The 40 person rule and the max 6 invite rule came about as a compromise.  The minimum 40 to post rule was what large guilds wanted so there would be faster turnaround.  I.e. remove the 12 person groups reserving the plane all the time.  The minimum 6 person rule was asked for by the small guilds so they could attend more raids and the policing action of the 2/3rds rule would be gone.<br>
<br>
So Verbalsabre, to answer your underlying question - 6 is an arbitrary number.  It has little baring on anything about the planes except that it make everyone happy enough.  It helps to reassure everyone that only those that can do the plane by themselves reserve it, and nothing more really.<br>

<br>
Here's an example. RoS, LoL, and KEG all invite all 8 toons from M&amp;M on their planes raids for 3 days in a row.<br>
<br>
Why should we care? There's no extra loot being given out. It's being taken from what RoS, LoL, and KEG would otherwise loot or let rot themselves. And there's no additional planes dates being taken up. And if RoS, LoL, and KEG don't care that M&amp;M is going to planes 3 times a month, why should we? Nobody else is being hurt but those 3 guilds.<br>
<br>

Now that the number to even post is 40, outside invites mean nothing. People are literally harming the calendar this way. SO your guild has 20 peeps and is taggin along sometimes with 1 or 2 guilds and your gettin loot occasionally and everyones happy. Now they want to make you recruit more and get your own PW. Yea great idea lets try and take the number of posting guilds from the 35 or so we have to 80 because those other 45 guilds can no longer goto the planes with the larger guilds. Everyone allaince up and lets go for 60 or so posting guilds that way everyone should be happy going to the planes once every 2 months.<br>

<br>
To us, this is the only option that preserves the ability of the members of smaller, role playing guilds who will never meet the 40-minimum consistent access to the planes for their higher level members (i.e. they do not have to rely on personal invites).  Option B would put undue pressure on these guilds to ally, whether or not it is consistent with their guild's mission or play style.  While people might feel this is &quot;the right thing to do&quot;, we think it is important to support guilds that have resisted the urge to become large for legitimate reasons, yet still keep their members who would like to play the high end game.  It may not seem like much to some, but as a guild who has over the last year lost some key members to uber guilds solely for this reason (consistent planes access which we could not provide, until now) it is a big issue for us.<br>

<br>
No BB Clause: There is no need anymore.<br>
<br>
40 to post: Keeps calender uncluttered.<br>
<br>
6 invites from another posting entity: Prevents piggy backing.<br>
<br>
Unlimited invites for non posting guilds: Gives small guilds the chance to stay small and still get to the planes without taking up additional dates. <br>
<br>
Indy day on the 1st: Lets small guilds have a guarenteed day they can go in case they cannot get invites from posting entities. <br>
<br>
In other words a vote for A and a vote for throwing out BB and &quot;maybe&quot; we have a set of guidelines that everyone, uber and not, can live with. <br>

<br>
&quot;Verbal,<br>
<br>
option a would permit non-posting guild to never attempt to become a posting entity and they could have all 20-25 of their members invited on any raid they wanted to instead of spreading the 'wealth' as it were around. (now that's a run-on!)&quot;<br>
<br>
So you're saying that this guild a would never attempt to become a posting entity, thinking they can get invited all the time to the planes? Don't you think the guilds doing the inviting would mind that the people they're inviting have already gone on say 5 planes raids this month and will be taking some loot from their own members? That this guild is going to be so well liked that say 5 or 6 posting entities won't have any problem constantly inviting them, knowing that these 20-25 people will be absorbing some of the loot meant for the members of their own posting entity, and that nobody would mind?<br>
<br>
I'm just trying to understand those of you who voted option B, WHY you did, since almost all of you just put &quot;guild x votes b&quot;, so please try to help my slow, Ogre brain understand.    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Gorgash Spiritmaul <BR>

(Verbalsabre rechecks his logic) Nope..still makes sense, guess Ogres are smarter then we thought. That does it, I want an Ogre Wizard. <br>
<br>
Seriously..For those of you that voted B I would like to ask you for a favor. Please read through the entire post one more time. I see so many advantages to A and none to B. My hope is that upon further review that you will change your mind and support option A. Once this vote is concluded I will shut my mouth and never bring it up again. I am not one to lament over my losses but as long as it is open I will campaign. <br>
<br>
Option A: Does NOT tie up additional dates on the calender, does NOT take loot from anyone other then the posting entity that chooses to give it away, and DOES give the little guys more opportunity to get to the Planes. <br>
<br>
To be fair it also means I may go to the Planes 3 times and you may only get to go once but guess what, if you limit me you STILL only get to go once. <br>
<br>
Option A will not effect you, but it will effect me in a positive way...please support that. <br>

<br>
Although new to posting, I have been lurking quite a while here, listening to discussions, flames and inbetween some very good ideas from most who come here.<br>
<br>
My feelings have already been expressed in other post here so I wont be long winded about it. I agree that allowing whomever I want, who is a non-posting guild, and as many as I want to invite from that guild is not going to harm or effect the integrity of the calendar system. <br>
I thought the 6 person rule limiting invites for posting guilds was to guarentee no abuse to the calendar by those posting guilds who would simply keep inviting each other on their planes dates. Thus the same people would be raiding the planes 2 and 3 times each plane date (depending on their alliances).<br>
<br>
I don't see where invites from non-posting guilds effects this rule at all, seeing as how the non-posting guild would never have a plane date to begin with on the calendar.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I see no reason to limit non-posting guild invite to 6.<br>
