<br>
Actually, empathy is not particularly an inherent part of the human psyche, but rather something we've developed over time as our self-awareness has similarly developed.<br>
<br>
And to say it is not in your nature to rape, murder etc is, I believe, erroneous unless you are using 'nature' in a different sense from the one I am familiar with.  Having evolved from animals we still retain many of our animal instincts - amongst those our sexual drive, competitive and territorial natures.  Similarly, it is instinctive to us to strive for and defend these other aims by physical means, up to and including murder and rape.  It is only as our culture has developed that we have learnt to better control these drives - and yet certainly we have far from overcome them, as evidenced by the rape, murder and other acts of aggresion that continue to occur in our culture to this day.<br>

<br>
Are you reading Aba's posts, or just looking for snippets you can take out of context to further your campaign against him?  Sorry, but I do believe Aba's posts were insightful, and well thought out - he has taken the difficult position of trying to be objective and see outside things from the point of view of someone without the influence of Western culture, and if he made a couple of heated comments in reference to certain people then I prefer to take that in the context of his whole post rather than focusing merely on that and seeing that as the be all and end all of his debate.  Also, he did not say he believed any Christian, Jew, or Muslim believing in there religious texts to be a 'religious moron', he said &quot;and anyone that states, &quot;Just another example of why we need another 40 days &amp; nights Flood,&quot; as you yourself quoted.  I believe the reference was to those who believe in meeting violence with violence and divine retribution, not to those who believe in a certain religion.<br>

I mean that I could not do such acts.  I personally could not torture or kill another human.  I can't even watch that kind of thing on tv or movies.  Any friend who knows me could tell you that I get extreemly upset when I view things like that.  Even just hearing about this crime makes me want to cry.  It is not because of any moral value that I feel this way.  It's a an emotional, chemical, and physical reaction, not an intelectual one.  <br>
<br>
We are self-aware, and that awareness extends to others.  We have &quot;feelings&quot; and emotions like sympathy and guillt.  <br>
<br>
But you can explain this from an evolutionary standpoint. Chimps form bonds and friendships and show apparent and significant distress when an individual that they are bonded with is hurt or killed.  This is one of the natural mechanisms that keeps chimp family groups together.  And more and more animal studies are turning up evidence of what we would call &quot;feelings&quot; in many classes of animals.<br>
<br>
I am not walking around fighting off urges to hurt other people.  I don't have that urge.  To say that it is only laws and taboos that keep us from hurting each other is really short-changing humanity as a whole.  Even if you think that babies are born with only an entirely selfish ego, that does not imply that we are completely aggresive and ruthless until taught otherwise. <br>
<br>
And to defend another point that I made earlier:<br>
<br>
You can argue that I would kill someone in the face of my own death or the death of my family or in a time of war.  But that has no bearing here.  Because that is an entirely different type of situation.  This girl was by all acounts completely innocent and helpless.  Not the same thing.  In fact, I would consider rape (outside of the context of the instinctual desire for procreation in animals) to be a much more violent crime than murder.  Most of the murders and killings in the world are not committed with the intent of causing and delighting in the extreeme pain of the victim.   Except for serial killers.  Most murders are done by people who are trying to gain something or to escape something.  In war, people are fighting for what they believe is right or believe has to be done.  They are not &quot;getting off on it&quot; as rapists are.  And rapists and serial killers are usually people who were severly abused in their life.  Not people acting on some natural desire. <br>

<br>
For those who think that me posting this here was judgemental...you're damn right it was. Not because I think my morals are better than theirs are, not becuase I think I know right from wrong better than they do, but because they lack some basic cognitive functions.<br>
<br>
If they decide that walking along the street with a member of a higher caste is a crime in their society, fine. The problem I have is the leap of &quot;logic&quot; that leads them to punish [b]someone else[/b] for that social crime. <br>
<br>
Another problem I have is that punishments should fit the crime. How does having person A gang raped for the crime of person B associating with someone of a higher caste fit as a punishment tailored to fit the crime? Punishments are usually meant to act as deterrents in most primitive societies (which is what I consider this - hell yes I'm being judgemental). How does punishing [b]someone else[/b] deterr the perpetrator of the crime? I understand the clan and family importance placed on justice in primitive societies, but indirect punishment simply is not fair.<br>

Okay, I wondered if that was what you meant - in that case my comments regarding evolutionary nature do not apply in this instance, my apologies.  And I think that in the sense you are talking about, it is not in the nature of most people in Western culture to commit such atrocities either (though some of the events that do occur show that it is still present in some).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I am not walking around fighting off urges to hurt other people. I don't have that urge.

<br>
That is not what I intended to imply - I believe it is the development of our self-awareness and empathy that leads to us constraining our instincts in certain areas, rather than simply the laws.  That said, not all cultures have developed self-awareness and empathy to the same degree or in the same manner.  It would not, I feel, be accurate to say that *everyone* can empathise with the plight of others, or even see a parallel between the harm they cause others and what it would feel like to have such harm done them.  There are plenty of examples of people who do not have this ability.<br>
<br>
As for the development of feelings in animals, and the bonds and 'friendships' formed between them, yes, these do exist.  In most cases, however, they serve to unite a single race against a common enemy, whether that be competing races, the environment or whatever.  Even within such tribes of animals, however, there is internal competition, violence, 'rape' and other acts that would be considered atrocities in our human species.  The instinctive sexual drive, for example, almost invariably in the animal world leads to the alpha male, the one with the greatest physical prowess, more or less raping any number of females of the species - I realise this is not true of all species, but it has been true of our own and many which are similar. <br>

It is universally understood that killing another human being , under some circumstances, can be acceptable.<br>
War != murder<br>
Self Defense != murder<br>
Premeditated killing someone for money/power = murder<br>
<br>
The basic argument still is weather there are beliefs, or basic truths, that transcend religious and social boundaries. It’s a debate that philosophers have been having for centuries. I would still argue that there are truths that are held by every human on this earth.<br>
<br>
Looking at the situation from their perspective and possibly know their culture you might get an understanding of why this happened. Given their social context, it might even be reasonable. <br>
<br>
However, that in no way excuses them from what is RIGHT and what is WRONG. If a child is abused all his life, when he grows up he will probably abuse his children. To that person he is not doing wrong, he is merely doing what he was taught. His social context told him that abusing children was ok. From his point of view he was doing no wrong, but from our point of view he was doing great wrong. <br>
<br>
Who am I to judge? Morality isn’t based on a judge system, but rather a jury system that encompasses ALL of humanity (I’m talking about here on earth, what happens afterwards is god’s domain). I am not judging, but I’m casting my vote. Yes majority does rule, and the majority says that rapeing a little girl is wrong.<br>

I believe the reference was to those who believe in meeting violence with violence and divine retribution, not to those who believe in a certain religion.”<br>
<br>
I would agree with this ...<br>

BUUUUUUTTTTTT Aba SAID (read your own quote)<br>
<br>
 “implying they believe in Noah's arc, well, then I feel religious moron is a justified statement. “<br>
<br>
he CLEARLY stated anyone believing in Noah’s arc is a religious moron not ANYTHING about divine retribution but for what they BELIEVE!!!!!<br>
<br>
I repeat <br>
<br>
“implying they BELIEVE in Noah's arc, well, then I feel religious moron is a justified statement. “<br>
<br>
<br>
HIS WORDS NOT MINE !!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Not taken out of context  he states anyone who believes in Noah’s ark is a RELIGIOUS MORON!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
the attack is on the people for thei BELIEFS!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
He condemns himself as a bigot and hatemonger please Benway don’t defend this kind of  mindless hate of people for what they believe!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
He has NOT taken a difficult position!!! he has set himself on top of a mountain and has determined that those who don’t share his belief are RELIGIOUS MORONS<br>
<br>
Aba is a hateful religious BIGOT don’t be fooled by his clever speech he SAID he believes anyone who is a Christian, Jew, or Muslim  and believes their religious text( Noah's ark) is a RELIGIOUS MORON !!!!!<br>

For the girl and what she endured,  For her brother who will have to live with this being seen as his fault within his community, and sick for the parents who felt helpless in the circumstance.<br>
<br>
I cannot judge a who people, and their culture however for the act of a few individuals. If i did then id be a very bitter person by now, i could easily hate many peoples due to my cultural predjudice.<br>
<br>
However i hope the people who committed this crime, get caught. Even the local police say this act was illegal. But fear of reprisal for speasking out against the tribal council will probably ensure no one is brought to book for this horrific act.<br>
<br>
But as it has been rightly said such horrific acts are not limited to this geographic area, they happen everywhere within different cultures, to varying degrees, rape is common all over the world, as is murder, sadly. This dont make em right, but means before we judge a whole culture for the acts of a few, we should get our own backyards in order. <br>

<br>
If you believe that the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> public gang rape</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of a 18 year old girl, because of the actions of her brother is wrong, you have every right to judge a whole people (in this case, a tribe).<br>
<br>
This isn't an incident in Texas where a couple of drunken white guys drag a black man for miles behind their pick-up truck because they thought it would be &quot;fun&quot;.  If you judged me as an American because of that, or judged a Texan based on that incident, you'd be wrong.<br>
<br>
What's the difference?  In the case in Pakistan, this wasn't the act of a few people, acting out in a foundless rage or prejudice.  This was the &quot;council ordered .. rape of [an] 18-year-old girl&quot;.<br>
<br>
Not only were the actions of these racists in Texas not &quot;ordered&quot; by a governing power, they were condemned, and those racists now await their much deserved appointment with an bigot-sized toaster.  Good riddance.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Of course</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> atrocities have been committed by Christians, Americans, Europeans.  That doesn't make them any less awful, or less wrong.  Can I judge the 15th and 16th century Spanish culture for the Spanish Inquisition?  Yes.  American culture for the acceptance of slavery, and in many areas lynchings/murders (that went unprosecuted)?  Yes.  Can I judge European culture for their treatment of Jews up through the reign of Nazis (arguably, even now)?  Yes.  And I do.<br>
<br>
Does this make <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> every</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> contemporary (or modern) Christian/American/Euro bad?  No.  So I'll extend that judgement to this tribe in Pakistan.  I am willing to believe they are not all bad people.  I am also willing to call their cultural standards wrong--based on the actions of said culture.<br>
<br>
What gets me about Aba's (and supporters') arguments is how readily they can condemn Christianity (I am an atheist btw) or Western culture for &quot;our&quot; atrocities, yet bring up the fact that the Africans who became slaves in the West were (the vast majority) not taken from their homes by white slavers--they were taken from their homes by other Africans, and sold/traded in coastal ports to European slave ships.  Can't judge Africans, we don't live in their culture, we can't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> understand</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  (And, of course, I have to say this, or I'll be picked apart by PC people--not all Africans were slavers).  <br>
<br>
Or bring up the religious slaughter, based on Islam, done in the later Moghul periods in India, where far more people were slain because of their religious beliefs/refusal to convert, than by European Crusaders (granted, this is probably due to the fact that many more people lived in India at the time than did in S. Eastern Europe/&quot;Holy Land&quot;).  But it's &quot;different&quot;.  How?  &quot;European/Western culture is inherently evil, atrocities commited in the East are different because their culture is different.  We can't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> understand</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;.  Bullsh!t.  If it's wrong, it's wrong, and if the culture in which it was commited condones it, the culture is wrong, too.<br>

I did not &quot;condone&quot;, &quot;accept&quot;, or &quot;justify&quot; what happened to the girl. I said it was wrong, and that I was glad that the Pakistani government had arrested the people involved, and I hope they will be punished to the full extent of the law.<br>
<br>
ALL I said was that calling an entire society &quot;inhuman&quot;, &quot;diseased&quot;, &quot;barbarians&quot; and such, and advocating the &quot;wiping out&quot; of the society was unfair and disgusting. I said rather than spewing hatred and advocating violence, we look at the causes of such traditions and attempt to effect real change. I did not say to ignore the incidence and work on the causal issues, I said that the incidence should be taken care of via their legal system and work should be done on causal issues to prevent the situation from happening again. Either read the posts and respond to them rather than some stupid reply, or go back to gradeschool and work on reading comprehension.<br>
<br>
Regarding &quot;religious morons&quot;. Yes, I feel fully justified that anyone that believes in something ridiculous is a moron, and one that believes in something ridiculous due to religion is a religious moron. You can believe in whatever version of god you want - science cannot &quot;disprove&quot; the supernatural, as it is set up to explain the natural - but believing something that has consistently shown to be impossible in the literal sense, is stupid. I can have the &quot;belief&quot; that my toes are aliens that are talking to me. That doesn't mean anyone has to respect that belief, particularly - in reference to the point at hand - with intellectual honesty. I personally think the idea of a god is stupid - particularly the gods of the various religions - but I don't think people that believe in the various gods are stupid. I do believe the people that believe in strict creationism, Noah's ark, etc, are morons. They have taken a morality play created to teach a point of morals as literal truth, even in the face of evidence to the contrary. That is moronic.<br>
<br>
Such things are not only in the realm of religion, within my own field I consider many many people morons, because they allow their &quot;beliefs&quot; (i.e. preconceived notions on how or why something happened) to overcome logic - particularly when it happens to be a pet theory they have published on over the years and have made a name for themselves with - an the available evidence. There are people that still claim hominids were actively big game hunting millions of years ago, even though anyone that has looked at the available evidence knows that is completely unsupported by the evidence. But because these people have made such a feature the cornerstone of their theories, they refuse to acknowledge the reality of the situation. Those are &quot;scientific morons&quot; if you will. Yes, I can attack people for their &quot;beliefs&quot;. I only have the intellectual responsibility to respect someone's &quot;beliefs&quot; in the absence of evidence or the absence of definitive evidence. &quot;Belief&quot; in the face of contrary evidence is called &quot;stupidity&quot; and &quot;stubborness&quot;.<br>
<br>
Believe in a god? Go ahead. Believe in Jesus as the son of god that died for our sins? Go ahead. Believe Mohommed was the prophet? Go ahead. Etc, etc, etc. Those are matters of belief for the people that believe them. Believe the earth was created in 4004 BC in 7 days? Hell no. You are a f***ing moron.<br>
