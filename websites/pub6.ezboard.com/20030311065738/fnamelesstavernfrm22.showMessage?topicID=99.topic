<br>
The sleek, shining, obscene metallic tower thrust into the air without compromise.  The land surrounding it was blasted by hatred and cussing, what once was a serene and beautiful town that was Chiapas, Mexico, has been tainted by this evilness.  Immense, jagged shards of dust covered stone jutted upward from the bleak ground, dotting the landscape.  Throngs of people gathered around the tall spire with hatred in their eyes.  Eyes all focused upward.  Attitudes ranged from the healthily disgruntled to the frothing, rabid enraged.  Occasionally, a muffled but wholehearted shout burst from the crowd, and was often supported by more ruckus yelling.  Dull, amused mutters drifted from the tower top, accompanied by the crunch of bone upon metal teeth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Fucking robot!” hollered a child no older than twelve.  Frenzied screams of encouragement for the youth’s words ensued.<br>
                                                                <br>
                                                                   ***<br>
Deep in the heart of the wilds of central Taiwan, there is what most would call the eighth wonder of the world.  Some would say it should be the first.  The sun rises, gently caressing the top of a beautiful tower, worked all in gold and purple gems.  This day, the large, pink ruby cresting the structure dazzles the eye like a translucent condom, casting a soft glow on the small village below.  A genial glow.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Within the topmost floors of the tower we find its head patron.  He stands, his ebony hair seemingly untouched by the fierce breeze, gazing out the open window, easel and paints before him.  A gentle smile upon his face, he takes the brush and lazily strokes the paper, creating sensual lines of artistry with every effort.  Perhaps it is his imagination, but he swears that the paper had just moaned at his touch.  His smile broadens.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;hehe~. a gentle touch . of this brush, so many things, for you`&quot; he coos.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
With more violence than preferred, the door to the room bursts open.  Rigoberto and Omnipomp stagger partway through the doorway, bent double, breathing hard.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Big trouble, sir,” manages Omnipomp, just as Rigoberto begins explaining the problem, with Omni giving his own rendition on top of it.  Still at the window, smiling, but eyes troubled, the man makes a calming gesture.  Both boys fall silent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;brothers. , red goblins like candy`~ but dentist fellow improve tooth` dentist not home hehe`~?&quot; he asks, his brilliant smile widening into an almost blinding cornucopia of light and sparkles.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Before either could answer, though, Reevex calmly strode between them, glaring slightly at each.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“The Robot has returned, Genial,” says Reevex levelly but cautiously.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Genial’s smile finally slips away.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The sun descends upon the hazy landscape that is Southern California, in a white washed house like any other, flanked by high quality costly automobiles, most notably a sinister looking 2001 Ford Mustang, red as the ripest cherry, sits like a bull dog waiting for its master to let off the reigns, so it can rip into an unsuspecting Mexican childs throat. In this car sits a man, his features non-descript in the shadows. In his lap sits a sniper rifle, its barrel the only thing of brightness in this dark, foreboding landscape. <br>
<br>
“Genial won't even know what's coming to him.” Manalope chuckles to himself as he wipes the barrel grease from his hands.<br>
<br>
The car roars into life and backs out of the driveway, and then departs down the road in a high pitched squeel of tire rubber, its destination, Chiapas, Mexico.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
“HEY FAT BOY! MAYBE YOU'D LOSE CALORIES FASTER BY NOT EATING FUCKING ICE CREAM WHILE WALKING! WHY DON'T YOU DO THE COWS A FAVOR AND FUCKING SHOOT YOURSELF, THAT WOULD INCREASE THE COW POPULATION BY TEN FOLD, BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE SLAUGHTERED SO FAST TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND FOR FUCKING HOT DOGS THAT YOU KEEP SHOVELING IN YOUR FAT FUCKING MOUTH!” Roared the robot from the sky overheard. <br>
<br>
Bobby Riis, enjoying a casual day walking along savoring his ice cream cone, was stunned. The ice cream cone fell from his trembling hand, his head drooping, his jolly good nature draining from his eyes. He set off down the street, emotionally crushed, pondering as to where he could find a gun at 13 years of age. <br>
<br>
“Fucking robot.” He whispered to himself as the tears welled in his eyes.<br>
  <br>
***<br>
<br>
“Rigoberto` , plz bring orb.” Commands Genial, his facade of self-dignity and mental fortitude temporarily shattered.<br>
<br>
“Yes sir.” obliges Rigoberto, his little legs moving as fast as they will take him to the purple velvet lined treasure chest sitting in the corner of the room. Producing a key from his pocket, he opens the chest, it's hinges squeeling from years of disuse. Lying swaddled in more purple velvet cloth, is a small grape fruit sized sphere, translucent, seemingly filled with swirling rose colored smoke. He gently lifts it from its confines, and with tender and loving care, hands it to Genial.<br>
<br>
“ok thx bro~ fucking ! robot is not knowing. what coming to him is orb fill of love ! orb` of emotion ! orb of sensuality``!!” Ejaculates Genial, wildly gesticulating in the air as he spouts this, with such emotion his purple tinted sun glasses almost falling from his stoic face. <br>
<br>
Reevex, looking impatient, clears his throat and proceeds,<br>
<br>
“Genial, it has been 30 years since you have last encountered The Robot, and you barely lived that time. Don't you feel that these years have worn on you a bit? Do you think you can handle him this time?”<br>
<br>
With a dismissive gesture, Genial chastizes Reevex, “hey` bro., hehe, a dragon with a treasure of old age`~, he is not still dragon`` !?”<br>
<br>
Reevex nods, and just about as he departs from the room, Genial booms, “bro !, rhino` comes out africa` , sense danger ! put head down .... run ... hehe` ... rhino is not of being stopped !”<br>
<br>
Genial extends his right arm, extends his index finger in Reevex's direction, winks. “trust,`” he invokes, and spins, not unlike MC Hammer, and discorporates into a cloud of pink mist, and floats through the window.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The crowd around the tower, ever-growing, ever-violent, simultaneously screaming at the top of their lungs in a ziggurat of pure hatred, throwing rocks and sticks in a futile attempt to damage The Robot. <br>
<br>
We see The Robot silhoutted across the red sky, moving frantically, its metal limbs flailing out at a seemingly endless pile of bones, stuffing these bones in its grotesquely shaped mouth, chomping away with sick crushing noises, only stopping when he views someone that particularly disgusts him. He notices a middle-aged male in the crowd, his bald spot poorly hidden by a hasty comb-over, his eyes magnified by his cheap wire-rimmed glasses.<br>
<br>
“HEY BALDY!” The Robot roars.<br>
<br>
“M-Me?” The man stutters, pointing at himself.<br>
<br>
“YEAH YOU! WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FOOLING!? IF I WERE YOU I'D FIND AN INDIAN SOMEWHERE AND HAVE HIM SCALP YOUR DUMBASS! YOUR HAIR LOOKS LIKE SHIT! AND WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOUR EYES THAT YOU NEED TO WEAR FUCKING PORTABLE TELESCOPES ON YOUR SHITTY HEAD!? YOUR EYES GET TOO STRESSED OUT AFTER TOO MUCH INTERNET PORNO?! GOD, HOW FUCKING PATHETIC CAN YOU GET!? DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND COME UP HERE AND LET ME OIL MY JOINTS WITH YOUR BLOOD!” The Robot screams across the sky.<br>
<br>
The mans lips quiver. His hand reaches upon the ground and scoops up a jagged shard of glass. He clutches it so hard blood runs out of his fingers, pattering on the ground. “Fine then...my life isn't worth anything, I realize this.” he mutters to himself. He looks to his left and right, the glow of hatred leaving his face, his features sagging. He takes the glass and shoves it into his neck, a fountain of blood spurting out, curtaining those around him in a sheen of red. He falls to the ground, gurgling, the only life and energy left in him being used to pound the shard deeper into his throat, finally he stills, and lay there, bleeding, the pulse of blood slowing down as his heart stops, and, he dies.<br>
<br>
“HAHAHA, YOU FUCKING MAGGOTS SHOULD FOLLOW HIM! I GUESS HE WASN'T SO STUPID AFTER ALL!” Shouted The Robot, his arms flailing overhead.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Manalope shut the door to his car, and proceeded to make his way to the top of a hill overlooking the tower. He hums “It's Raining Men” along the way, his mind filled with hatred for Genial, and love for Rigoberto, his one and only. He finds a perch, and sets up camp. He has full view of the situation, his rifle secure, his sights set on the top of the tower, where he knows Genial will appear, then he will get his revenge.<br>
<br>
“MOTHERFUCKING Genial, how dare he steal Rigoberto from me!?” he growls, as he gets into position.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The crowd moans in ecstasy as the pink mist appears in the night sky. Boys experience their first orgasm, men try to cover their erections. Women clutch their stomachs, and moan. The mist coalesces at the base of the tower, revealing to the crowd the source of the sensual eruption. <br>
<br>
A well formed male, about 6 feet in height, of normal stature, decked out in a light blue suit, shiny black pointed wingtip shoes, a red bowtie. He stands looking at the crowd, a humongous smile gracing his face, his hands formed into fists, wresting on his hips.<br>
<br>
“hey guys ! is fucking ! robot come !? give you bad day`!?” he questions the crowd. <br>
<br>
“Who are you!?” shouts a small boy from the throngs of people.<br>
<br>
“hehe ., you know me ! i come this time`, love not here ! i bring this, i bring love !” he shouts, throwing his hands into the air. The crowd is mesmerized as tens of thousands of butterflys erupt from Genial's hands.<br>
<br>
“i am genial pure`song ! 60 bard of TN server`~ !!” he roars, seemingly without raising his voice. <br>
<br>
“HEY FAGGOT, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE!?” screamed the robot, with a tinge of fear in it's voice.<br>
<br>
Genial turned towards the tower, cupping his chin with his thumb and finger, considering The Robot.<br>
<br>
“hey `! jerk !! stop be a jerk !!!” Genial proclaimed, as he took off into the sky towards the top of the tower, not moving from his pondering stance.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Manalope centered his sights at the floating Genial above the tower, aimed straight at his heart. <br>
<br>
“Time to sing song your ass straight to hell, you fucking flamer!” he proclaimed, and squeezed the trigger.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Genial slowly opened his coat, reaching for his weapons, and he felt something rip through his chest. <br>
<br>
He turned in agony, seeking the source of the bullet. Another bullet ripped through his shoulder, crushing the bone into little shards. He spotted a glint in the distance, and he rocketed towards it in the night sky, his feet not moving, a concerned look on his face.<br>
<br>
Dodging a rain of bullets, his coat flailing out from behind him, he deftly tosses a few pink grenades towards the unknown sniper. Rainbows assault the spot where the grenades land, he see's the outline of the sniper diving to get out of reach of his patented ”Love Grenades” and he continues on. <br>
<br>
Setting down on the perch in a cloud of dust, he realizes who his assailent is, and he is enraged. <br>
<br>
“manalope you p of shitz ` ! rigoberto. , boy contain love now ! boy look at you~ see soup that is not hot !!! hehe .. why you not hot !! manalope !!?” <br>
<br>
“How the fuck did you not die? I fucking shot you in the heart.” Manalope screeched.<br>
<br>
“hey bro ~ let me give you secret.. , ok ?” said Genial, as he pulled the orb out of his jacket, ”see !? he is friend i call 'motorcycle' ! he my pure`heart !” proclaimed Genial<br>
<br>
“So what the fuck, you are telling me that that orb is your fucking heart?” asked Manalope<br>
<br>
“hehe ` yes ~” Genial said, as he put his orb away. ”you want battle` !?” inquired Genial, not even waiting for a response, Genial floated over to Manalope, his feet moving in blinding speed. Manalope raised an arm to protect his face from the incoming enslaught of pure Taiwanese fury, but it was futile. Genials delicate yet mighty hands descended onto Manalope's face, crushing his cheek bones and nose in an open handed slap. <br>
<br>
Manalope fell to the ground, Genial followed, his feet flying into the air, delivering blows to Manalope's midsection, crushing internal organs and breaking bones wherever they met.  <br>
<br>
“you want play pattycake``?” Genial laughed to himself as he picked up Manalope, who was falling into the depths of unconsciousness at this point, and grasped his head inbetween his hands. As his grip grew tighter, his smile grew wider, until finally Manalope's skull cracked and collapsed inward, as pale brain material squirted between the cracks of Genials fingers. <br>
<br>
“ok sorry bro`~ plz have good day` ok?! ^_^” Genial smiled to himself as he licked his hands clean. Genial slowly turned to The Robot, who's only activity the whole time has been faint screeching noises, and winks.<br>
<br>
“you next robot` !” Genial proclaims, flying towards The Robot's platform. <br>
<br>
“HEY YOU FUCKING FAGGOT, STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!” The Robot pleaded. <br>
<br>
But Genial did not stop. Rushing towards The Robot he lobs grenade after grenade at it, each explosion punctuated by The Robot screaming as if in the depths of purest hell. The Robot started retaliating, tossing bones at Genial with as much force as it could muster. Genial, wrapped up in trying to put his hair back into place in between lobbing a grenade, is struck squarely in the groin.  Genial misses a step, falters momentarily, and the Robot delights in the momentary weakness.  Screaming with  pure born hatred, the Robot rages towards Genial and throws an enormous metallic fist at him . . . and hits only a cloud of giggling pink smoke.  Genial, standing on a spire some fifty feet away, laughs uproariously.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;hehe`~ hey bro,. slow like you !? haha` grandma have spirit foot .. you have shit foot !&quot; he chuckles wryly.<br>
<br>
Erupting with manevolence, the Robot begins dancing in random circles, spewing shards of razor sharp bone in every direction.  Genial stands calmly, bone fragments wizzing within inches of his body, and draws his weapon of choice.  A bright pink hula hoop emerges from the expansive folds of Genial's cloak, and he slips the device about his flaring hips.  Instantly he turns into an intense worlwind of passion, spinning to and fro, deflecting all of the Robot's onslaught.  As suddenly as it had begun, though, the Robot stopped.  Completely.  Wary but knowing, Genial grins at it, and waits.<br>
<br>
A hissing emerges from the rear of the Robot, and black steam pours from an opening.  Slowly, Genial throws aside his hoop and moves to get a better look at the figure emerging from the fucking Robot.  Moving sinuously, Crazz steps through the steam and points at Genial.  Genial laughs again, heartily, and shakes his head.  He reaches within his cloak once more, and draws out a beautifully worked quarterstaff, topped on each end by a lifelike dildo.  Casually, he spins it with grace.<br>
<br>
&quot;hey bro. know you so well so many times ! hehe` no touch .. no die ok ? hehe i show you my arm !! is bolding`!!!&quot; snickers Genial.<br>
<br>
&quot;Goddamnit Genial, get the fuck off of me and go molest more boys or something.&quot; seethes Crazz between gritted teeth, while pulling out a large, primitive club.<br>
<br>
Then they danced.  Like spirits without reason, their movements were akin to lightning, flowing around and about, touching, smashing, dodging.  However, it was clear after several minutes, with Genial still laughing, and Crazz sweating like a Polish arm, who had the upper hand.  Suddenly, however, the tables turned when Genial lost his footing, and fell to his back, Crazz, extatic, rushed in and held Genial to the ground with his massive truncheon.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&quot;Hey faggot, learn how to fight, ok?&quot; spat Crazz.<br>
<br>
&quot;no thx bro ' &quot; said Genial, grinning quickly.  Crazz never saw the tip of the flesh colored dildo touch his cheek, but he screamed, still, and evaporated into black smoke.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Crazz woke sometime later.  It was day, then, foreboding clouds gone, though he was still on the tower.  A cage surrounded him on all sides.  Rising slowly, he looked down at his tower grounds to see them no longer blasted, but blooming with millions of colorful daisies.  He snarled.  There were still a few people there, though.  One fat boy met his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU FUCKING LOOKING AT, YOU PATHETIC FUCKING FATFACE?&quot; Crazz yelled angrily.<br>
<br>
But the boy just smiled, rose his hand, and flipped him off.  He was not afraid.<br>
<br>
Crazz wept.   <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Genial looked off into the sky, tears welling in his eyes. His day was done, his quest finished.<br>
<br>
&quot;hehe`~ all a day work done ... a time had for all .. a smile for boy ` face ... a genial smile !&quot; He boomed.<br>
<br>
The crowd cheered and made their ways home, a smile on all of their faces. <br>
<br>
Genial floated away, leaving a rainbow in his wake.<br>
<br>
What's lies in Genials future? A new love? A new enemy? We'll know soon.... ;-)<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> “Rigoberto`</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> , plz bring orb.” Commands Genial, his facade of self-dignity and mental fortitude temporarily shattered.<br>
<br>
“Yes sir.” obliges Rigoberto, his little legs moving as fast as they will take him to the purple velvet lined treasure chest sitting in the corner of the room. Producing a key from his pocket, he opens the chest, it's hinges squeeling from years of disuse. Lying swaddled in more purple velvet cloth, is a small grape fruit sized sphere, translucent, seemingly filled with swirling rose colored smoke. He gently lifts it from its confines, and with tender and loving care, hands it to Genial.<br>
<br>
“ok thx bro~ fucking ! robot is not knowing. what coming to him is orb fill of love ! orb` of emotion ! orb of sensuality``!!” Ejaculates Genial, wildly gesticulating in the air as he spouts this, with such emotion his purple tinted sun glasses almost falling from his stoic face. <br>
