<br>
No words are going to bring Trompen's epic back.  We live in a violent world, violent deeds have made us who we are...<br>
<br>
For too long peace has reigned between the guilds, for too long we have used words that, however initially eloquent, generally dissolve into character assasination and personal attack...<br>
<br>
Gum flapping about who did what is for those who have lost their teeth.  Negotiation is for the weak and old. <br>
<br>
Blood and vengeance would be a beautiful thing to witness in EC... although it solves nothing, it is really great for testosterone levels... <br>

This was 6 damn days of Trompen's life where he took off vacation time from work.  Sit there and camp something for 6 days, have it taken at the final hour, then please by all means come back and tell us your loss isn't that great.

And as was pointed out, that is not possible, Vaylin will sit there laughing his ass off<br>
<br>
second, who said anything about a 6 hour camp?  I'm full aware of the camp's length, thats why i suggest get 8 friends who you trust, and take 3 hour shifts, so you still go to work, go out with your friends, whatever.  CoN is a good guild and most of them i know as trustworthy, so why can't trompen have a guildie set up another computer for 3 hours or however long the average play time is and camp the spawn.  This lets trompen have a life and go to work and stop wasting vacation hours.  This allows someone else to still play there character (or better yet use trompen to powerlevel in skyfire or whatever).  Trompen gets epic piece, and not much of that time used was his own.<br>
<br>
We sit here glowering over unrealistic solutions, which is a waste of time.  The real solution needs to come through instead of this wasteful whining and bickering.  Trompen is most likely, not going to get someone to camp the mob for him from SoT.  I don't think its worth their time, but that's just speculation, as only they can answer that.  The best thing he can do is take his hits and move on.  Life will only get harder for him if this bashing of SoT keeps going.  Pretty soon they get pissed and say fine, don't expect any help from us.  Then who do you call to CR you in fear?  BotS?  it makes you wonder if this is truly worth it.  If all this flaming of SoT is truly worth the possible outcomes.<br>
<br>
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.  Watch, when SoT finally says no to a CR assistance, you all gonna be right back here telling them how evil and stuck up they are.  I don't blame them if they say no.  I wouldn't help people who were calling me dickless assholes either <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugraalthedorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Graal the Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tad-pole</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/26/02 1:00:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=475.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: clarification</span><hr size=1> &quot;then who do you call to CR you in fear?&quot;<br>

<br>
Make alliances! Plan battles! Gather together and make those who defy you and sneer at your weakness feel the true wrath and scorn of LEGION!<br>
<br>
Agree upon appropriate restiution by the vanquished if that seems the only way to resolve the issue.  For example, SoT could agree to assist in camping the zone again so Trompen can get his epic if they get beaten down...<br>
<br>
Sure, even now, SoT could say, &quot;Hey, we're sorry, we're gonna help you camp your epic now, we see that we we're wrong&quot; etc... but overall they really don't see how they have done wrong...  <br>
<br>
This is a two way street and I can see truths to both sides of the disagreement.  Release that stress and kill one another people... don't give yourselves an ulcer over a (dare I say it?) silly game.<br>

<br>

<br>
Wow, Grulnick, I thought maybe you could see farther than yer own nose.  No, this wasn't a loss that compares to losing something valuable in RL. But, it was a HUGE loss of time.  You really have no concept of community or shared gameplay space.. do you?<br>
<br>
I can't even fathom how you can straight-faced type that, other than just to troll.<br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
And now, Groont:<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know all the details as to what went on, I just know that i see people acting like morons flaming a guild that helps them half the time over one instance.&quot;<br>
<br>
One instance can easily outweigh 100x itself in good deeds.  I trust Dwallyn's log post, and that is easily enough reason for this to be more of an outrage than you give it credit for.<br>
<br>
Second, the only moron I see is the one who doesn't take the time to learn the basic details presented here and then posts how we're baselessly flaming.. is you.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
This may come as a shock to some of you.. but mmrpg's aren't single-player games.  You're playing with a large amount of other live people.. any action you take has a consequence.  Simply explained.. this is called c-o-m-m-u-n-i-t-y.  Some communities evolve into no-holds-barred ffa fests, some evolve into communities that try to benefit more than one dominant group.... but they're all communities. No, you don't just get to pay yer $12/mo, and do whatever you feel like.  You can try.. but there are in-game consequences to your actions.. and these effect the people behind the screens emotionally and psychologically.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, but Nicolai, it's just a game!&quot;  Yeah.. whatever, this ain't monopoly, Jack.  It involves a large amount of real people (gasp! with real feelings!) who spend an enormous amount of time interacting with each other.  The emotional attachments to other people and the attachment to the time invested are only trivialized by dimwits that say &quot;It's only a game&quot;.  To those, I recommend going back to Diablo or Quake.. it better suites you, and the rest of us can actually take responsibility for our actions and realize there are consequences without you @#%$ it up for us.<br>

Groont,try READING more of the post then just to note this is a badmark for SoT. Then read some more about how theres more then SoT to &quot;bail&quot; you out of bad situation. Then read some more , just for your sake , about the OTHER bad marks for SoT are posted here. Then keep moving down the line back to following CiW around. <br>
<br>
SoT stole someones epic mob. Not just an item , but his TIME and efforts. He should not HAVE to just &quot;suck it up&quot; and move on. But as it happens , he has moved on. He ISNT going to recamp RF , least not for now. he is outa vacation time , not to mention other RL constraints. What I want to know is when YOU are going to come camp RF for him? After all its such a trivial thing....<br>
<br>
I dont know about you , but if something ment that much to me , that I would spend MY vacation time to insure I got it instead of spending time doing something ENJOYABLE , just to have it stolen , yes STOLEN ... apparently you cant even fathom that or you wouldnt be posting like this. <br>
<br>

This wasn't a mistake - a mistake is where you go &quot;oops&quot;. There was no oops here - it was premeditated. The logs bear out that there was no remorse - they went in knowing the CoN guy was going to be screwed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Being premeditated has nothing to do whether it was a mistake or not. The only thing premeditated shows was that they have a greater amount of imputability for their action than if they had not planned it out beforehand. A mistake is when you do something you should not have done. It is not something you do accidentally. THAT is called an accident, NOT a mistake.<br>
<br>
If no one can ever be forgiven for doing something bad... well then I'll see you in hell. <br>
<br>
Note: I am not making a value judgement on you at all. I am merely saying that if we can never be forgiven for anything than we might as well resign to the fact that hell (if there is anything remotely like hell) is where we are headed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umongomfh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mongo mfh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/27/02 9:48:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=475.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: gah</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  6 hours of your life are taken, great, take your hits and move on. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

We have all been screwed out of something before, whether intentionaly or not intentionaly. It doesn't feel good, we hey that's just life. You suck it up and drive on.<br>

Stop blaming everything on a guild that holds no contempt for you.<br>

that log does not reveal some KS scheme, all it reveals is that indeed no real rules were broken.<br>
<br>
As far as community and shared game play, people in general are good people, noone ever tries to ruin your day on purpose with you as a target. But, people want things, and they will take them if it's within their power. If you get in the way then that's your bad luck. <p>Pictures are worth a thousand words.

I think THAT is the point that people are trying to make.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is completely my point. They did not say &quot;OOPS!&quot; it was an accident. They said &quot;I'm sorry we made a mistake.&quot; Admitting you made a mistake has NOTHING to do with the accountability for that action, whereas (as you have stated above) and accident does. <br>
<br>
Admitting you made a mistake is showing that you know what you did was WRONG. <br>
<br>
The reason I am bringing this up is because people seem to think SoT is saying it was an accident. Thats not what they are saying at all, they are simply admitting that what they did was wrong. To say that it CANNOT be a mistake because it was premeditated (as our friend is doing above) is completely ludicrous. It CANNOT be an accident, but it was OBVIOUSLY a mistake.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umalkablackheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malka BlackHeart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/27/02 11:21:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=475.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: gah</span><hr size=1> Question for you Grulnick.<br>
<br>
Does Might make Right?<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is that its the Principle.  Yes we all have disapointments in Life.  But the Principle of this is that something done that is not socially accepted.  You cant give back the time Trompen camped Rage.<br>
<br>
In my opinion its not the Killing of RAGE thats the issue its the fact that people used Might make Right.  I have enough power to kill something so im going to do it and no one is going to stop me.<br>
<br>
Well more power to your Uberness... I wonder how lonely it can get at the top. I personally would rather never get there if thats the way im expected to act.<br>
