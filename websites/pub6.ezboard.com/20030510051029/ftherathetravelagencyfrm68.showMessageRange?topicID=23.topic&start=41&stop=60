During the Cold War, there were basically two leaders - the USA and the USSR.  Neither could really exert direct influence (troops) on any boarder governments to swing them to one of the political poles because of the threat of escalation.  The only way to influence such areas was through covert support/action.  This is why you see weapons made by the USA in the hands of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.  Now that the Cold War is over, some countries are feeling a little more safe/bold in using direct influence. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=joekreeper1>joekreeper1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 344<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/6/03 4:37:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I smell bull$hit</span><hr size=1> OK how can you support the Troops and hope their mission fails when mission failure in a military action means the troops DIE?<br>

<br>
When I refer to the fair solution being to listen to the majority I am refering to the decision, not the process. In terms of the process, yes, you should listen to everyones opinions. When you make the decision however, not everyones opinions can be enacted at the same time because they will cancle out ie: going to war but not going to war. This is why listening to the majority is what I believe to be fair and it is how democracy operates. There really are only 2 options in this case which are war or no war, doing nothing (or neither for sake of a C not just AB as you refer to) is really the same thing as no war and I dont quite think you can have a sorta war, maybe though. A sorta war if that exists is still war I assume however so I have to put that in the war catagory. Which as I already said leaves us with war or no war, and both can not exist at the same time which is why you have to make a decision. Also I dont see how the solution in this case, war, stopped anyone from having their opinion. There has been namecalling, yes, from both sides though. Not sure if your refering to me in that though, dont recall any namecalling on my part...<br>

Bad assumption.  I'm neither left or right.  In fact I am a huge advocate of captialism, while by all means is very &quot;right.&quot;  I do not love or trust the UN but I do believe they should be given more time.  Again, tying too many variables together creates flawed logic.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There are 2 very important reasons why Iraq is not allowed to have these weapons and other nations such as the US are. 1) We are responsible with them, for example we dont use them on our own people, as well as we abide by the Genevia convention. Saddam does use them recklacely and he does not abide by the convention. 2) The world community does not agree we shouldnt have them, as is the case with Iraq. I urge you to show me a country, for the war or not, that thinks Saddam should be allowed to keep his weapons.

Big statement from someone that believes in such a thing as &quot;Overly Patriotic&quot; ... <br>
<br>
If there was a such thing as a time machine, I'd buy one just to strap you down , and send you back to a few of the Other Wars that the US has fought in ... Independance War , Civil War , WW I , WW II , Korean , Vietnam .... And let you say that to people that fought in those. <br>

Although in my opinon if you are not in the military, this shouldn't be any of your business, but people feel the fact that we owe them an explination on why we do things.

Let me quote myself in case you were confused.  I do not support what the government is doing (going into war with Iraq).  However, I wish the troops, in following the orders, return safely.  This shouldn't be a difficult concept to grasp.  Where in here do I say I hope for a military failure?  <br>

Like to start out by saying, never said you were against capitalism. Although I am pro-this war, and disagree with you, I am not one of those who try to make the connection anti-war = anti-capitalism. Yeah just wanted to clear that up. Also, sorry for falsly accusing you of loving the UN it seems I was mistaken.<br>
<br>
The US does disarm itself, this is in the form of the treaty between the US and Russia that currently is having them disarm themselves of nuclear weapons. Considering the US doesnt use weapons such as these recklessly I have no problems with how long it may take them. Iraq on the other hand is very aggressive, may support terrorism (not proven yet, but they certainly use similar tactics and DEFINATELY dont oppose terrorism), and has been told by the world community including france through numerous resolutions. I dont seem to recall such a request being made of the US by the UN, maybe because we havent done anything wrong with these weapons?<br>
<br>
I honestly dont see how you can say you are not arguing when in every post you debate against the pro-war. You have every right to do so yes, however, both of us also have the right to believe the other is wrong, this is not oppression. How you draw the difference is really quite beyond me, and because I think you are wrong does not mean I am close minded, in fact I have examed both sides of the arguement and decided I disagree, this is not close-mindedness. Do you in your opinion believe I am wrong? Does that make you close-minded if you do? I personally dont think so wether or not I agree with you.<br>

First of all, I completely agree that Iraq has misused their weapons.  I agree that it's not unreasonable to ask them to disarm most of those.  However, I think it is unreasonable to ask them to disarm all of their weapons (for sake of defending their country).  I think all nations whether preceived as good or evil should be allowed to defend themselves.<br>

You're right, I am arguing for my point of view, however, I am not down playing anyone else's point of view.  That was my main concern.  I did not carry out my message very well in an earlier post and I appologize.  When I spoke of the idea of oppression, it was in conjunction with people being very closed-minded and explicitly stating that there's right opinion and a wrong opinion (which I believe goes quite a bit of ways past simply disagreeing).  I, like yourself, believe everyone has the right to their own opinions, hence then remark about oppression. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=118063" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~ywz/xarien.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

Iraq has shown repeatedly its intentions for such weapons. They have not used them in defense against the US (Thankfully) but rather always in aggressive methods, I know its been brought up a lot, but gassing the Kurds is not defensive. Iraq, through its policies has in my opinion lost its privilage to ammass military might unchecked. I do not think this means they shouldnt be allowed to have anything, but rather they should be regulated in a way that has been generally agreed upon. Their aggressive nature is why I believe they should be regulated in this manner, as well is why I assume the UN placed such restrictions in the first place. The violation of these restrictions repeatedly is in part why I support the war, esspecially because I dont see anyway to just tell Saddam to stop and actually have him listen. My other reason of coarse is the human rights violations, I dont however think that we should go to war with every country who mistreats their people, even though I think those people deserve a better life. So basically just reafirming my position and reasons for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=petruccib>Petrucci B</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/15/03 6:40:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I smell bull$hit</span><hr size=1> I'm getting to this real late.

I am pro-American, support the troops, and am possible even thinking of joining the Marines after H.S.<br>
<br>
You don't see civilians hurt on U.S. news channels because the media knows better than to show it.  The media's job in all this is to convince the American public that the war is morally right, showing civilians being killed won't help that.  You will never see a major news channel speaking openly against war, or the actions of the U.S. government.<br>
<br>
Now, one of my close friends is Egyptian.  He gets Al Jazeera (I think that's what it's called) tv via satellite or something.  He showed me some of it last time I was over.  And the fact is, that in some places, morgues have begun to put little children and adults in the same 'containers' (I don't know what it's officially called) in order to save space.  You don't see or hear about this because anti-war demonstrations will soar.<br>
<br>
Fact: 1,700 civillians were killed. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean they aren't dead.<br>

Sooooo wrong. They have a job to report what the truth as best they can, the problem is they keep trying to insert there personal view points. I have seen dozens of wounded Iraqi civilians, some horribly mutilated. It doesn't make me happy, but I also know it was not something that could be helped given the circumstances. It is apart of war, like it or not. It is not the media's job to convince us of anything. Just like it is not some highschool dropout actors job to tell me his/her view points on the war, it is their job to entertain me. I've seen far to much of the political view points of all the actors and reporters I can stomach personally, but they are by no means withholding information about civilian deaths in Iraq. <p>Mcnubins Smith<br/>
