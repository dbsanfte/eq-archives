The thing with Clinton politics is it was all touchy-feely-Ifeelyourpain bullshit. He got people to respond to him on an emotional level. Once he did that most people were willing to turn a blind eye to his peccadillos. <br>
<br>
It was kinda like your favorite (insert deadbeat relative of choice) who has a shitload of charm and no morals. Sure you should tell them to get lost but they are so damn amusing at times you just don't have the heart to. <br>
<br>
You know the type, they usually end up in jail for date-rape or something similar and have at least one relative crying to the media about how misunderstood they were.<br>

Sure, he lacked moral fiber, but he did do his job, acting as a figurehead for our political system and making a few well informed choices on policy.<br>
<br>
Are you aware of how the American political system really works?<br>
<br>
Start learning about it, an interesting beginning for learning simply about the election process is &quot;The War Room&quot; which detailed the '92 Clinton Campaign, I believe it is available at most video rental stores.<br>
<br>
Maybe you'll also see how George Bush Sr. helped his son get elected(well outside of the whole vote count bullshit).<br>

<br>
YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET<br>
by Neal Boortz<br>
<br>
That, my friends, is the very last line of the official Platform of the Democratic Party. &quot;Now, we say to America .. you ain't seen nothing yet. Here we have the Democrats touting their so-called &quot;accomplishments&quot; of thepast eight years, and telling us &quot;... you ain't seen nothing yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
You know, you sit down and you think about that line for a few nanoseconds,<br>
and you start to get a little worried! Oh, you're not worried? Well, then .. you're just not paying attention. Look at this wonderful closing the Platform of the Democratic party this way and see if your serenity starts to crumble ....<br>
<br>
During the past seven and one-half years .........<br>
<br>
We've seen the president's &quot;wife&quot; try to nationalize 17% of the nation's private economy through her heavy-handed plan for socialized medicine.<br>
<br>
We've seen major Democratic campaign contributors sell and transfer vital American nuclear, missile and satellite technology to avowed enemies of freedom and of the United States.<br>
<br>
We've seen wholesale violations of basic campaign finance laws.<br>
<br>
Then we saw the Democrats and the Clintonistas engage in a concerted effort<br>
to make sure that none of these campaign finance law violations were subject to a serious criminal investigation.<br>
<br>
We've seen five members of Clinton's Cabinet come under criminal investigation.<br>
<br>
We've seen 33 connected to the Clinton administration convicted of crimes.<br>
<br>
We've seen the Lincoln bedroom in the White House turned into a high-priced<br>
five-star hotel almost 600 times ... with the basic rate being a huge campaign donation to the Democrats.<br>
<br>
We've seen seats on government overseas trade missions sold to the highest bidders --- sold for campaign donations.<br>
<br>
We've seen a president dropping his trousers in the Oval Office to receive oral sexual favors from an intern barely older than his daughter.<br>
<br>
We've seen the president grope and fondle a woman who came to him for help<br>
in securing a White House job --- wrapping up the sordid episode by taking<br>
her hand and forcing it into his crotch.<br>
<br>
We've seen 45 witnesses in criminal investigations or critics of the Clinton administration subjected to IRS audits.<br>
<br>
We've seen five women who were said to have been associated with Bill Clinton complain publicly of physical threats having been made against them.<br>
<br>
We've seen Hillary Clinton issue a 42 paragraph sworn statement to a House<br>
investigating committee investigating Clinton wrong doings and in those 42 paragraphs we saw hillary use the phrase &quot;I don't recall&quot; or its equivalent no less than 50 times.<br>
<br>
We've seen Bill Clinton say &quot;I don't recall&quot; or its equivalent in portionsof his testimony about Paula Jones 271 times.<br>
<br>
And when it comes to failed memories, we've seen other Clinton administration friends and officials say the words &quot;I don't recall&quot; or its equivalent a total of 6,125 times before various investigating committees --- for a grand forgetfulness average of 235 times per person. In otherwords ... we've seen the most forgetful group of political operatives in the history of this country.<br>
<br>
We've seen a president lie under oath - several times.<br>
<br>
We've seen a president use the powers of his office to obstruct justice and to deny a private American citizen her constitutionally guaranteed right to a day in court.<br>
<br>
We've seen American servicemen scattered to nearly 100 foreign nations to serve as glorified cops and cafeteria workers in various international &quot;meals on wheels&quot; schemes.<br>
<br>
We've seen aspirin factories in foreign countries bombed to divert attention from presidential scandals.<br>
<br>
We've seen the bodies of dead American servicemen dragged through the streets of inconsequential foreign dog-patch nations by mobs of people who aren't fit to utter the &quot;would you like french fries with that&quot; anthem of the American high school graduate.<br>
<br>
We've seen a president agonize over what the definition of &quot;is&quot; is.<br>
<br>
We've seen a president refuse to personally respond to a very credible accusation of a violent rape.<br>
<br>
We've seen almost one thousand confidential FBI files of those not friendly to the president's political agenda gathered by former bar bouncers working in White House security positions --- with absolutely no consequences.<br>
<br>
We watched in 1996 as the Democrats rushed to naturalize tens of thousands of illegal aliens in time for them to vote Democratic in the election, and, in the process, including thousands of violent felons ... all for a few votes.<br>
<br>
We've seen all of this, and we've seen so much more. All of this ... and the Democrats are telling us &quot;you ain't seen nothing yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
If they're right ... we need to run , and never look back! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/u10sun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>10sun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Instigator</span><br>  Posts: 2260<br> <font color=#333333>(9/16/02 8:52:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=936.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> well written Martrae, I'll read it in full after I get off work.<br>

Just as the fierce indifference--and in some cases outright hostility--of Florida officials to the practical demands of democracy warped the Sunshine State's 2000 presidential vote, so the &quot;fixes&quot; initiated by Bush, Harris and their legislative allies have resulted in another election without a result. As The Nation went to press, the contest between former Attorney General Janet Reno and wealthy lawyer Bill McBride for the Democratic nomination against Jeb Bush was too close to call and both campaigns were readying legal teams. <br>
<br>
When Floridians went to the polls September 10 to nominate a Democratic challenger to Jeb Bush, they were supposed to encounter voter-friendly ballots, machinery and procedures. Never again would Florida voters be victimized as they were in 2000 by election systems that even the US Supreme Court, which awarded the presidency to George W. Bush, acknowledges violated the Constitution's equal protection clause. That was the promise of Jeb Bush in May 2001, when he signed reform legislation and declared, &quot;[We] have resolved the problem. Other states ought to look at this as a model....&quot; <br>
<br>
Bush boasted too soon. Instead of a fix, he and Harris--who quit her job to run for Congress--cut corners, failed to recognize potential technical problems and provided inadequate resources and information to local election officials. The byproduct was such chaos in at least fourteen counties on Primary Day 2002 that it sometimes made the 2000 presidential vote look like a smooth operation. Poll workers failed to show up in Broward County and didn't know how to turn on vote-counting machines in Duval County. An optical scan machine in Union County registered votes only for Republican candidates. When new, ATM-style voting machines couldn't be activated in Palm Beach County--home of the butterfly ballot--frustrated voters walked away. A polling place in Miami opened five hours late, after more than 500 voters were turned away. Across the state, voting machinery in dozens--perhaps hundreds--of precincts failed to operate properly. Problems were so widespread that Bush finally ordered voting sites to remain open for an additional two hours, but some precincts failed to get the message and shut their doors. <br>

As in 2000, problems were reported most frequently in heavily Democratic districts and communities with large minority populations, like Miami's Liberty City district. And, just as flawed voting systems and procedures made it virtually impossible to get a precise read on the results of the 2000 presidential contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore in Florida, so chaos in the 2002 primary voting muddled the result of the Reno-McBride contest. Reno had to wait for more than an hour for the computerized voting machine at her Miami-area precinct to function. &quot;What is it with Democrats having a hard time voting?&quot; Jeb Bush mused, displaying the same quickness to blame the victims of the state's incompetence as did Republicans in 2000. <br>
<br>
The better question is: What is it with Jeb Bush and the Republicans who control the Florida legislature that they have such a hard time reforming a flawed election system that Cuban officials have offered to send democracy educators to the state? Florida isn't about to accept that offer anytime soon, so it falls to Congress to intervene. Bush, Harris and many Congressional Republicans have argued that states are best prepared to set election standards. But Florida's primary chaos makes it clear that it's time for Congress to pass uniform national standards--as proposed by Congressman John Conyers, among others--to guarantee that all states treat voters equally and that resources are allocated fairly to low-income and minority precincts. <br>
<br>
Congressional Democrats, who have been negotiating compromises on election reform legislation in a House-Senate conference committee, should recognize that soft standards will be abused by the likes of Jeb Bush. And Florida Democrats, who have struggled to mount a coherent gubernatorial challenge to Bush, ought finally to recognize that repairing the state's damaged democracy can be a winning issue for their candidate--if they ever figure out his or her identity.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hate Reno if you must. You can't fault her for asking for a recount. Florida is a key state in national elections and things are lining up to be another clusterfuck when Bush runs for reelection.<br>
