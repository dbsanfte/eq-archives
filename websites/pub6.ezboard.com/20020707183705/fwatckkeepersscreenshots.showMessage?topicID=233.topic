Solitude and Service<br>
<br>
“When Christ said ‘I was hungry and you fed me.’he didn’t mean only the hunger for bread and for food; he also meant the hunger to be loved.  Jesus himself experienced this loneliness.  He came amongst his own and his own received him not, and it hurt him then and has kept on hurting him.  The same hunger, the same loneliness, the same having no one to be accepted by and to be loved and wanted by.  Every human being in that case resembles Christ in his loneliness; and that is the hardest part, that’s real hunger.”  - Mother Teresa<br>
<br>
Shivva awakened once again in the camp of her compatriots, the morning after her discussion with Volga.  She watched from her dune as the clan gathered again by the fires to eat breakfast.  She heard murmurrings of talk about breaking camp and heading to the Eastern Wastes and conducting warfare to the heart of Kael Drakkel, the empire of the giants of Velious.  An advance party was to travel to the Wakening Lands and rendezvous with the main assault force in the Arena and fight the final battle there.<br>
<br>
The clan members finished eating and having their morning conversations, then set upon the task of breaking the camp and making ready for their journey to the Eastern Wastes.  Shivva rose from her dune of snow and let the snow fall lightly to the ground.  She proceded to wander through the camp in search of some task she could aid these mortals with whom she now called her family.  She approached one tent and offered to help gather the tent pegs and poles, but was asked not to fore she may cause them to become too brittle and make the tent unusable.  She excused herself and went to see if six of her family needed her in packing supplies up, but the six said  to her that they would take care of it because she would freeze the rations solid.  Finally, she decided to ask with whom she would be traveling with to Kael Drakkel and be fighting along side with.  They only answered that their unit assignments were full, but they would assign her to a group if they could, otherwise she would be on her own but glad to have her assistance there.  In the meantime, she was to wait at her dune up on the hill, as they would call for her when it was time.  With an inner sigh of rejection, she walked back to her dune of snow and settled down into a meditative position.<br>
<br>
Over the course of the next few hours, she watched her family pack up and clear the campsite.  It snowed all morning, and looked as though it would do so all day.  She was mostly covered in snow as it had drifted over her and made it her only clothes.  Sir Dokk and his council said their farewells to the rest of the clan and said to meet with them in the Arena tomorrow.  Shivva peered down onto the clan from her hill and watched in anticipation for a courier to come to her and place her in a unit.  Lady Quarrel teleported out Sir Dokk's unit and the others turned and started to travel to the east.  She sat there motionless and watched them disappear over the mountains, and then she was alone.<br>
<br>
Shivva sat there waiting for someone to return and call for her, but no one came.  The clouds grew grayer, and the day passed by, snowstorms increasing in intensity.  As night drew nigh, she was almost full covered in snow, only her head exposed, but well frosted with ice.  In the distance, she heard animal howls, and various creatures roaming the land.  A shard wurm meandered by and looked down at her, but Shivva could not bring herself to look up into its eyes.  In the silence of that frozen waste, she heard her heart break, and the fracturing of her crystalline heart hurt her greatly.  Her eyes clouded over and she felt immense pressure behind her eyes.  She wanted to sob, but she could never release the tears that were eternally frozen within herself.  With her inner voice she said &quot;Goddess E'ci, please speak to your daughter, alone and afraid in this world you have placed her in.  I look much like these mortals do, and I have sensations rather like their emotions, but I am not able to cope with these feelings.  I ask your forgiveness in my decision to be with them, and to try and be like them as best I could.  Please release me from this punishment.  I fear I cannot bear this want for family any longer; it pains me too much.  Show your daughter a being who is in need of aid.  Let me try and do that which you intended me to do.  Give me guidance and direction, as I am surely lost here on my own.&quot;  Her temples throbbed, her heart shattered, and her abdomain doubled in pain.  Wave after wave of loneliness and abandonment washed over her soul. &quot;Please Goddess E'ci, grant your daughter an answer.&quot; was all she could repeat in that moonless night.<br>
<br>
Her minds eye started to focus in on the terrain around her, then soared high aboved and moved to the west over the arctic lands, over the western sea, and to a different continent, then settling down upon an ancient four tiered spire near snow capped mountains.  From there it moved up high again and traveled to the northeast and and looked down upon a great crater in the earth, the surrounding forest burning and the ground smoking from heat.  And deep in that forest, it looked down upon a being with reddish brown scales, running through the woods.  &quot;Is this the being who needs my aid, Goddess E'ci?  Is this where I should go?&quot; But no answer came.  Shivva opened her eyes, and pushed her saddness away for the time and lifted her arms high.  She summoned a whirlwind of snow about herself and opened a portal to the ancient spire, then stepped out onto the other side.<br>
<br>
The terrain she would have to cross was mountainous and filled with crags, so she wove a spell of acrtic winds to levitate herself above the ground.  She then called for a spell to bend the lightwaves around herself, hiding her from mortal vision.  She ran through the valley to a tunnel and followed it out to the great mountainous expanse, then headed to the northeast. She came to a place where she could cross the mountain ridge easily to the burning forest and made her way to the north.  Once she had passed the large crater, she paused a moment and sent her mind's eye out to scan for this being.  Further to the north, she located him, lying on the ground.  She refocused and ran towards the creature.<br>
<br>
It lay there, wounded and bleeding profusely as she approached it.  The creature looked over to her with half open eyes and with labored breath hissed at her and said&quot; Leave me be monster,...I will not....die to the likes...of...you.&quot;  Shivva paused a moment and said &quot;Fear not mortal, I, the Herald of E'ci, have come to give you aid in your hour of need.  How may I be of assistance to you?&quot;  The reddish brown scaled creature did not speak for several seconds, just looking at her, the blood continuing to pool beneath the sarnak.  Her expression was emotionless, and appeared not to be threatening in any way.  &quot;I do not know what you are being....I have no reason...to trust...what you say.  Shivva replied with authority and sincerity.<br>
<br>
Shivva was confused as to why it did not want her help.  Was this yet another clan she would come across that would reject her or abandon her?    Perhaps it had not heard her correctly.  Shivva reiterated &quot;I am here to help you creature.  Tell me how I might be of assistance to you and your clan.&quot;  &quot;Then heal my wounds...creature...I am to die..if you don't.  Heal me...&quot;said the sarnak, his life slipping away from him.  Shivva quickly searched her mind for a spell of healing or regeneration, but found E'ci had not gifted her with such knowledge.<br>
<br>
Shivva cleared her throat and said &quot;Goddess E'ci is not to grant to you the gift of life, mortal, and keep your soul sheltered within your mortal shell.  I cannot aid you in this matter.  Perhaps you may have a different request of me that I can aid you in.&quot; she said coldly.  The sarnak's eyes filled with final dispair and could only face the fact he would die in this forest, his duty incomplete.  It was almost amusing to the sarnak that the one being that came to help him could not save his life.  &quot;Perhaps..you can..help me...another way..creature..&quot; said the sarnak listlessly as his vision dimmed.  &quot;Yes, mortal, ask of me your request before you cannot any longer.  And if it is within my domain of power and authority, I will grant you your wish&quot; Shivva said with pride and expectance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Being, I ask..that you...deliver this scroll.. to my people...It contains...that which...we need to...know...Goblins tracked...me and wounded...me here...and now...I die.  Deliver the scroll...to Chardok...Herald Telcha...give to him...make my effort...worth this...price...To the north...Chardok lies...&quot;  Shivva looked up and to the north, and in the far distance, she saw a fortress.  In the sarnak's blood soaked hands was a scroll case. &quot;Tell me of your name mortal, so I might give it to this Herald Telcha&quot; she said in a forceful tone.  But the sarnak lay still, motionless on the ground.  The blood no longer flowed onto the ground.  His eyes were glazed over, starring up at her own eyes.  His neck was limp, and his mouth was agape.  His chest moved no longer.  &quot;So this is death&quot; she thought.  And in her own way, she could feel how that sarnak died.  Vulnerable, helpless, relying on someone else to make her whole.  Her heart shattered a bit more.  She reached down to the lifeless sarnak and took the scroll case from his hand, it freezing solid in seconds from contact with her flesh and cracking from its brittleness.  &quot;Aye, creature, we share a common pain.  But at least you are free of yours, as I just yet start mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shivva got up, still hovering off the earth on her arctic current, and proceeded to the north.  Once again, she disappeared from mortal vision.  She approached a fortification as she passed by wurms and apes and went inside the fortress.  She found a passage leading deeper within and turned the corner.  There standing before her was a diminutive sarnak, about three foot tall.  He was pacing back and forth, as if expecting something urgent.  Shivva lifted her veil of invisibility and appeared in front of the sarnak, startling him.  “What manner of being are you lesser creature” it spat at her venomessly.   Taking a bit of offence at being called a lesser being she retorted “I, creature, am the Herald of E’ci, the goddess of the ice.  Speak to me with more respect or find yourself forfeit of your mortal existance!”  The diminutive sarnak cleared his throat and replied “Ah, an agent of the gods I have before me? What brings you to the Empire of the Di’Zok?” he asked with caution.  “I was asked to deliver a scroll to a Herald Telcha.  Are you this being?”she asked.  “Yes, I am the Herald Telcha, in the service of his glorious Overking Bathezid and of the illustrious Queen Velazul.  I am expecting a message from a courier that contained information of great interest to our Imperial court.”<br>
<br>
Shivva held the scroll tube out to the small sarnak and he quickly took it.  Opening it, he read the contents and exlaimed “What is this?!  The goblins plan on marching here and laying siege to us in our city of Chardok?!  The Overking and Queen must be appraised of this immediately!  What is your name Herald of E’ci?  Perhaps they wish to meet with you.”  Shivva felt a sensation in her spine, a sensation of excitement and of importance.  Filling herself with pride, she replied “I am the Lady Shivva, Herald of E’ci, and I am here to serve the people of this planet who are worthy of my support.”  Telcha sensed she was in want of something to show her power, to prove herself.  He changed his tone of voice from curiosity to a more persuasive one.  “Lady Shivva, I, Telcha, will be glad to escort you to meet our Imperial leaders, the Di’Zok royal family.  They will be honored to have your presence here and will be eager to have council with you.  Please follow me to the inner fortress.”<br>
<br>
Shivva finally felt the first twinges of need.  She renewed her levitation spell and followed behind Telcha.  They walked down a corridor hewn from the very earth of the burning woods and down to a gate house.  Guards and watch beasts lined the corridors and kept watch over the area leading further down to the royal citadel.   Walking through the gate house and through the gate door, they continued down a corridor twisting and over a high suspended bridge over a chasm. Eventually the corridor ended at a bridge to the main courtyard of the citidel area.  Also suspended above the chasm was several short plank bridges off of a main rocky outcrop that served as a nexus to many areas of the cavern.  Dark metal chains hung from the ceiling and dangled lightly rattling in the wisps of winds that permeated the cavern.  In the distance Shivva heard a waterfall of sorts, and as the passed by the gigantic Bridge Keeper golem, they emerged on the otherside to a waterfall with an archway in its center.  The wall of water prevented much from being seen on the other side, but it appeared other sarnaks occupied it, but in a more animated sense.  Their flesh was not a bright red brown.  It was greyed and flaking; their eyes sunken in and glazed over.  Some skeletons roamed the area as they entered through the archway and took little notice of either Telcha or Shivva.  Walking further down the winding path, they emerged onto a raised section of earth.  It contained a vast pit on which a sturdy and foreboding citadel was centered.  Only one solid bridge connected the cavern to the citadel, and all around there were guards, sarnak and constructs both.  One rather impressive construct made of a cloudy crystal substance paced back and forth over this bridge, in eternal vigilance of protection.  <br>
<br>
“Lady Shivva, this is the royal citadel of the Imperial family Di’Zok.  The Di’Zok have went through much struggle and conflict to bring peace to our nation and seek like minded individuals that support our aims and goals.  The royal family would be pleased to meet with you and discuss a mutually beneficial relationship. I am sure you would find this proposal to your liking, Lady Shivva.  Please follow me inside and speak to them in the receiving chamber” Telcha said with utmost cordiality and politeness.  Shivva knew she must be important and that this was truly where she could do her duties for E’ci.  If the first contacted mortals had no need of her, then she would seek out others that wished for her presence and favor.  She crossed the bridge lightly, suspended some two feet above the platform and entered into the Citadel Di’Zok.    <br>
<br>
She walked through two sets of doors and looked down from the second floor into a grand central receiving area.  A large set of stairs led down to the main floor.  Royal guards lined the walls and safely secured the premise in their niches.  Before her stood three of these creatures, dressed in rich black leather and engraved golden adornments.  They were a very tall example of their species, and they carried themselves well and regally.  She floated down the stairs behind Telcha and waited.<br>
<br>
Telcha cleared his throat and bowed deeply.  “Your majesty, Overking Bathezid, I present unto you the Lady Shivva, the Herald of E’ci.  Lady Shivva, I present to you the royal family of the Di’Zok Empire, Overking Bathezid Di’Zok, Queen Velazul Di’Zok, and Crown Prince Selrach Di’Zok. “<br>
<br>
“I am pleased to make your acquaintance Overking Bathezid and your family as well.  As your lackey Herald Telcha has stated, I am the Herald of E’ci.  It has come to my attention your family is in need of assistance, and I am ready to hear your appeal for my aid.”  Herald Telcha took the scroll of the fallen courier to Bathezid and he looked over it briefly.  Telcha whispered into Bathezid’s ear about this strange newcomer to their kingdom and said if she was powerful, perhaps she could end the threat of the goblins.<br>
<br>
“Divine agent of E’ci, please have a seat with myself and my beloved family.  We are in fact very pleased you have taken it upon yourself to grace us with your presence and would deign to hear our plight” Bathezid said in a sincere manner, motioning Shivva to sit down at a large table and that had four chairs around it.  She obliged them and had a seat and listened to what the sarnaks had to say.  “Tell me your needs Overking.” Said Shivva.<br>
<br>
“Lady Shivva, we of the Di’Zok Empire are beset with a conflict with the Mountain Death Goblins of the neighboring lands.  We have tried peaceful negotiations with them in the past, but they have met us with only deception, dishonor, and murder of our people.  We had dispatched a courier to them to discuss a term of peace, yet they only wish for our demise and destruction of our people.  They have many forces to send against us and they prepare for a final assault against us now as we speak.  Please Lady Shivva, join our forces and end their merciless existence” said the Overking.<br>
<br>
Shivva turned an inward eye to herself and scanned the surrounding territories.  She located a mountain peak to the east in a valley of mountains where great apes and giants roamed.  To the north and the south of the mountain she located small green creatures from this Mountain Death tribe.  Focusing back in on her surroundings, she lifted her gaze back to the Overking and his family.  “They do appear to be in great numbers, Overking.  But they have not seemed to have mobilized yet.”  Overking Bathezid thought of how to best persuade the ice woman to serve his cause. <br>
<br>
Queen Velazul spoke next.  “Dear great Lady Shivva.  Please hear our plea for help.  With the Herald of E’ci supporting us, we can easily defeat the armies of the Mountain Death goblins and the Di’Zok Empire will be allowed to rule in peace and harmony with the other kingdoms.  We have so far staved off several assassination attempts upon our lives but we fear they will spell our ultimate demise if left unchecked.  They have already caused me to lose my youngest child in a battle.  My unborn daughter was taken from me due to an attack...” The Queen said, making herself cry to garner more emotional support from Shivva.<br>
<br>
Prince Selrach quickly added “Please Lady Shivva, forgive my mother’s sadness.  She still grieves the lost of my unborn sister and is not emotionally ready to accept the loss yet” he said, adding to her ploy.<br>
<br>
Shivva felt a mixture of anger and justice build within herself.  These poor mortals were going to be slaughtered if she did not aid them.  Surely E’ci would not want such creatures to be wrongfully and unduely exterminated.  These Mountain Death goblins must be soulless and evil.  And if Shivva did not aid them, she would be responsible for their deaths.  The ploy the Di’Zok family had used had worked.<br>
<br>
“I have reached a decision family Di’Zok.  I will aid you and your kingdom.  The evil goblins will pay with their very lives for the injustices they have wrought upon your people.  You have gained my favor and as such, the Mountain Death goblins will feel the weight of their evil pressed against them.  The very mountains in that valley will echo with the lamentations of their people, and the ground will run red with a river of their blood.  You have my word of honor of this!” Shivva said with much self pride, and eagerness to show her worth.<br>
<br>
The Overking Bathezid smiled a twisted smile knowing he had garnered a ally to his cause.  “Thank you Herald of E’ci!  You have brought much happiness to our family and our people!  Please, accept these tokens from us and let us show you how grateful we are to have you counted as one of us.”<br>
<br>
Herald Telcha clapped his hands twice and two of the royal guard left the chamber and went deeper inside the citadel.  Another sarnak came to Queen Velazul and she whispered something to him, and then too, he disappeared into the citadel.  “Herald Telcha, bring forth the ring” said Bathezid.  “May I present to you Lady Shivva, the Di’Zok Signet of Service.  A ring that will grant you citizenship in my Empire, and safe passage in the city of Chardok.”  Telcha placed the ring on Shivva’s left ring finger carefully, and felt it quickly become cold once it was placed on her flesh.  Shivva already started to feel more at home with these beings and she began to feel like she had become one of their family.<br>
<br>
The three guards returned with a box and placed it before the Queen.  Velazul opened the box and pulled out black leather garments with gold embroidery and golden clasps and buckles.  “We of the royal family Di’Zok wish to give you these garments, Lady Shivva.  It appears you have not found any clothing since you have come to this plane and we would be overjoyed to outfit you with the finest of our Imperial dress uniforms.  We had this crafted for one not of our race if they would ever prove noble enough to champion our cause” Velazul said.<br>
<br>
Bathezid saw the spark of happiness flicker into Shivva’s eyes.  Velazul helped Shivva into the form fitting uniform and showed her how to wear it properly.  Shiva felt that this was what it meant to be the Herald of E’ci; a force to be reconned with; a champion of the mortals.  Bathezid summoned five Imperial constructs to the room.  They towered well above them all, mighty in strength, fortified with strong body, and powerful in stature.  “Lady Shivva, I present unto you five Imperial Constructs.  They will serve you while you lead them in the assault on Mountain Death.  They will serve as your personal bodyguards and follow your orders.  They will keep you from harm as you exterminate the evil goblins in their homes and in the mines.”<br>
<br>
Shivva became filled with new resolve and purpose.  She wanted the sarnaks to appreciate her, to love her, to want her company, and to love her.  “When will you wage the war against the goblins, Lady Shivva?” asked Bathezid expectantly.  “I will fight them this very night.  Beings tend to sleep at night, and will be unprepared for a conflict.  We will exterminate them tonight” she replied coldly.  <br>
<br>
“Marvelous, Herald of E’ci!  Please bring back to us their skins and samples of their assassins mineral salts as proof of your actions there.  We shall reward you for your efforts as such” Bathezid said in anticipation of final victory.<br>
<br>
Shivva in her Imperial uniform bowed to Overking Bathezid.  She looked up to Bathezid and said, “I will leave now and wait for night to come.  This coming eve, the Mountain Death will be known for the mountain of corpses left within it.  Imperial Constructs, to my side!  We depart now and claim victory for the Di’Zok Empire!”  The immense golems moved and followed her wordlessly, and the sextet departed the city of Chardok and left for the Frontier Mountains.<br>
<br>
Bathezid, Velazul, and Selrach chuckled in the chamber.  Yes indeed, they had a new ally.  One who was naïve, powerful, and easily manipulated.  All because she wanted love and acceptance.  This would be all too easy to keep her favor.<br>
<br>
Shivva marched the golems several hours to the Frontier mountains, and on a plateau, she gazed at the Mountain Death and thought to herself  “Live well today creatures, fore tonight is the last night you have opportunity to live.  The Harbinger of Winter comes for you, and all because your evil attracted the attention of the Herald of E’ci.  Tonight, you will all die.”<br>
<br>
The winds swept through the valley, catching Shivva’s hair in the breeze.  She no longer felt the hunger for family. As long as she was in service to some clan, any clan, she would no longer be in solitude, and the ache to cry in loneliness would not hurt her, anymore.<br>

One suggestion, Ice, is to post it in smaller sections.  I have a little more time than some, because I am home all day long (working, but still home <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  But Hap has such a limited time on the computer, and only a certain portion of that is for reading emails, forums, etc.<br>
<br>
If you put it up in instalments, it would make it easier for those who have limited time to read at one sitting rather than putting it aside for when they DO have time (which is usually never <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Maybe make it, say Chapter 3 - part I, the next one Chapter 3 - part II (and so on).<br>
<br>
Of course, that is actually doing me in, cuz then I would have to wait for the instalments, but I think it would make it easier on the time-challenged readers.<br>
<br>
Just a thought.  I felt everyone should have a chance to read your story.  *hug*<br>
