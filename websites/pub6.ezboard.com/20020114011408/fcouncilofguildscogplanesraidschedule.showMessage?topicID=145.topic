<br>
First off I need to appologize for Flarren and myself both being late to start time, we were both stuck working overtime and I got home 5 mins before start time, Flarren got back near 9 central just as his group ported up. <br>
<br>
We had 8 groups all together, 48 raiders in total which is less than some CoG raids and still more than others <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Port up was a bit harsh, group 1 had been accidentally ported up too early and so I was stuck upstairs and had to take over from Flarren's comp on the bottom. After the first couple ports we got things settle and got people up to the camp site safely. To the 3 (according to Steelheart's report) that stood and died when agro'd, thank you for remembering the &quot;stand and die&quot; method <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We had one person gate out due to not understanding why it would be necessary to stay and die but after it was explained they understood.<br>
<br>
Once we got to the camp site everyones boundaries were explained. We had a couple roamers but for the most part everyone stayed where they were supposed to. The roamers were warned. Once we were moved to the ground we had a few problems with people still on the wall and they each got a warning as well. The wall is NOT a place to be. I've seen a cleric BP rot cause no one could find the corpse in the wall.<br>
<br>
When the Ashenborne Drake was pulled everyone was told to head to the corner, this mob has a tendancy to knock back an incredible distance. I think people saw him standing in the corner and paniced at that point cause there were very few people that went to the corner. Now at this point I got ticked. To those of you who refused to listen to shout speech, I dont want you back. ever. Something that important cant be ignored. You could have been responsible for killing us all if he had knocked you back past the maestro and he had agroed. When a shout command is given its not to hear ourselves spout off, its for a reason, so listen and follow the directions.<br>
<br>
After getting very mad and explaining that I had had quite enough, things settled down into a patern of killing and lotto's. Many drops happened by some, Other mobs were very stingy. Overall the loot was pretty good.<br>
<br>
The call then came from Zellex to move to Maestro room. At this point we had a couple people get lost but the casualty list was minimal. One group was stuck back at the original site and had to finish of a Kira alone, nothing on it I believe. Once it was dead we all went to Maestro room. From there our illustrious puller brought us as much as he could and cleared around the maestro. Everyone buffed up and on Zellex's pull we attacked in waves. The big vamp liked to run around but in the end we had few casualties and he lay prone on the ground with a shield for lotto.<br>
<br>
It was at this point that we started loosing alot of people (since it was a monday night and really late) so the management team decided unanimously to call it a night and finish up the lotto's. The jems had been saved throught the night to lotto in the end, as well as trinkets. Reagent fee was handed to those that expressed that they had used a reagent in some way. I know some people left early so pls contact me if you did use gems so I can pay you back.<br>
<br>
*NOTE* by reagents I mean anything that you paid for that you used. for example - I used 1 pet stone and 3 cat's eye agats to buff myself, I kept 1pp in compensation. If you used anything at all on the raid that is what the fee is for. Wether that be peridots or malachites.<br>
<br>
The jems were rolled off, then the trinkets and I believe just about everyone walked out with something. The last roll was for the Maestro's shield to everyone on the raid. Fuzzey lucked out on that one so I bet he'll be making an erudite pallie to use it soon lol.<br>
<br>
Translocates, gates and ports went quickly and everyone was out in about 10 mins. Grats to those that won something, and thanks to those that stayed the whole time.<br>
<br>
C ya all next time and till then good luck and stay safe.<br>

To bad the rogue drops weren't better. <br>
Nice work Management team. Great pulling Zellex, as always.<br>
Congrats to the winners of the Loot.<br>
<br>
It was exciting to be in a plane raid where every fight I know I may bite it.  Haven't had that in a long time.<br>

And of course congratulate everyone who came and fought and in many cases died.  I hope they all had as much fun on the raid as I did.<br>
<br>
I think we all did quite well.  This was certainly a success for FoF and Flarren and Lag in particular.  This was their first planar led raid as far as I know and by and large things went very well.  We did have some problems, but these were mainly resolved.  What I dont understand is why its the same problems that keep cropping up.  What is so difficult about understanding not to stand on the wall?  Is there something that I'm missing on this?  Dont stand or sit on the wall once we've started clearing seems to be perfectly clear to me.  And yet throughout the night I kept seeing people up there.  You are risking the entire raid when you do that.  Not only will mobs tend to attack and follow sitting players, but you risk aggroing the second floor.  Yes, the odds of these things are low, but low risk does not give you license to endanger other people.  Especially since that risk is entirely avoidable.  There were also problems about people not staying where they were supposed to stay.  It was stated at the begining of the raid not to go past the arch.  I was in wolf form the entire time at the cut off point.  And yet people still went past me between pulls.  Please dont tell me you didnt notice my shouts and /ooc's or that you didnt see me.  Either of those are rather hard to miss.  In this case the problem is that Zellex was begining to pull from the Maestro area and would often get multiple pulls in his attempt to split them up.  By staying too far north you risk aggro'ing the entire pull.  I know things sometimes went slowly and we all want to jump around and do stuff.  But patience is a virtue and on these raids you need a lot of it.  Deal with it or dont bother coming to a large raid regardless of who's running it.  Next time I will be posting names and guilds of offenders.  We all need to work together on this, not just 45 people working well and 3 people doing what they want to.  And just remember, Fear can be much worse.<br>
<br>
Well, that was most of the bad stuff.  On the good side we did very well I thought.  We pulled a lot and we even got some revenge on the Maestro.  Now granted this was not as good compared to what we've done in the past and what other alliances do on a regular basis.  But for everything there is a first time and we all need to begin with baby steps.  Things will improve over time if we all just do our jobs and stick to getting better.  And I think many of us did just that.  And I want to congratulate everyone in the raid and not just the leaders.  Yes, leadership is important and thats what will determine if a raid will even get off the ground.  But it is the discipline and trust and courage of the raiding party itself that will in the end determine the success of the raid.  And I think we were pretty dang successful.<br>
<br>
On a side note Lagdalen, you apologized for being late.  I'm sure we all understand that.  And if someone doesnt, have them talk to me and I'll make them understand <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  But one suggestion I have is you might want to appoint a Secondary Raid Commander.  Preferably someone you trust not in your guild and preferably in a different time zone as well.  I think this will help get things started a bit more quickly (preliminary lists could have been done earlier) and limit problems if the leadership begins go LD for whatever reason.  Decentralization can be a good thing sometimes if handled well.  It will also help to foster new leaders and hopefully help bind the raid together better.  Of course I'm willing to put my mouth where my mind is and volunteer to help.  But I also think there are a number of other people from smaller guilds that would get a lot out of these positions too.  Stonescale and Zantriz for example and I'm sure there are others.  Spreading out the leadership and responsibility not only reduces stress but will help in creating a new level of up and coming leaders who can take over to run their own raids in the future without running into the problems of a learning curve.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thats just been my own outlook on the raid in general and some things we can do to make it better.   In the end the success of any raid is going to depend on the actions of the individual raiders overcoming their limitations and fears and melding with other disparate groups to create something much larger than they themselves.  Right now we're succeding in spite of our limitations, however, I will like to see the day when we succeed because of our limitations.  Disparity and individuality are the true weakness of any organization and paradoxicly its greatest possible strength.<br>
