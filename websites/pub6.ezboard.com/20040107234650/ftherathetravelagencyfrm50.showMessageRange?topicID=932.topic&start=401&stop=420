Actually though, we do. at least, im America we do. But the thing is, that, assuming you DO have no say in the sewage system, that is because you are not on the cities commitee that decides &quot;all things involving sewage&quot;. Rig's point is that the Rathe community, at least the reps ARE a part of that community that decides what to do with sewage.<br>

Rigorre what is so funny is your comments comparing the RTA to US political system and I am going to go out on the limb here and guess you are a registered Democrat because most of them don't have a clue about the US government. Why don't you go back to school and actually learn something.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Our glorious Founding Fathers ...those icons of historical revelation ...those who we owe gratitude to for having the courage and insight to create the fair, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>democratic system</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> by which we live today <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> WRONG<br>
<br>
Do you think the US is a democracy? Nope it is a Republic of States, hence the United States of America. If you actually read the Declaration of Independence you will notice that it was spelled &quot;united States of America&quot; in that document. Key here is Capitals of States and America stressing this is a country of the States of America. Maybe you should read the constitution also one of these days. It also explains it very well how our system works. Were you one of the people whining when Gore won the popular vote, but lost the election? When that happened it showed how many people really had no clue that we live in a Republic or how our government really works. Did you think when your vote in the Presidential Election actually means anything? This country was never intended to be direct democracy, nor was it intended that the president be elected by direct vote. <br>
<br>
Short US Gov101 lesson just to turn around every argument you have used basing them on the US government and trying to link the RTA to it.<br>
<br>
First you might want to read about the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/ecworks.htm" target="top">Electoral College</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> The truth is the Presidential Election is nothing more then something to allow people to express an opinion about something, but has no actually meaning in the election process. It is not a democratic election of the president nor was it ever intended to be.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They didn't want just any moron making the laws by which everyone lived by<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Correct, but not for the reasons you stated. The main reason for this was to allow the states to govern themselves and not have outside interference from other states on issues that states thought were personal. There were common laws made that applied to all when needed, but the main thing our founding fathers wanted was to keep the states independent. One thing that has changed over the years is the number of federal regulations and law now, which in fact goes against everything our founding fathers and the constitution intended. <br>
<br>
Now how are the States represented in our Government? With the House of Representatives it is done up so every state is given a number of representatives in the house that is based on the states population, which is approximately one member for every 600,000 people. The Senate is made up of 2 Senators from every State. This helps insure that no matter how small the population in a State they are always given representation in our Government. Through the first 130 years of this nation, senators were chosen by state legislatures. When the Seventeenth Amendment was passed in 1913, making senators directly electable by the people, we turned senators into nothing more than representatives with longer terms, special interest &quot;$&quot; puppets and bigger egos that don't represent the interests of their state. <br>
<br>
Based on this while you see every State might be represented, their voice in the Government is not equal to every other state in voting powers. States also believe strongly in keeping their State rights. The reason the South went to war in the Civil War was over Slavery, but not for the reason most think of. It was because they felt the US Government was trying to impose a regulation they felt should be a State regulation and not a Federal one. The problem was the North had a much greater population at the time and more people in the house and were able to pass regulations that affected the Southern states, hence Civil War stated.   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I did not 'invoke' the Freedom of Information Act ...as you say. I invoked the IDEA of the Freedom of Information Act as an example of what fair and impartial governments provide for the protection of their people. An idea, I might add, not shared by the government of the RTA. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You also seem to like to like the IDEA of the Freedom of Information Act. All agencies of the United States Government are required to disclose records upon receiving a written request for them, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>except for those records (or portions of them) that are protected from disclosure by the nine exemptions and three exclusions of the FOIA</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Well guess what, the RTA also has exemptions and exclusions. In fact the Guild Leaders of the guilds in the Elemental planes have stated time and again they were doing intelligence gathering and stratgy discussions, which is specifically exempted under the FOIA that you tried to use. So actually the RTA also likes the IDEA of the FOIA and are applying them. Wrong again on your statements.<br>
<br>
Now that you have had your quick US Gov101 lesson, because you were such an idiot in trying to use it in arguments, let me explain the RTA to you along the lines of the real US Government.<br>
<br>
1. While the RTA is not exactly like our Government as you try to picture it, it is close in many ways. The RTA is made up of a collection of States (i.e. Guilds) just like our Government. The large guilds have many more people then smaller guilds and therefore have a bigger voice in the house part of the Government, but smaller guilds still have a voice also, which you can consider their Senators. You keep saying the largest 4 guilds on the RTA are a minority and should not have that much of a voice in the RTA and use the USA as a comparision. Lets shoot down that comparison then by looking at the largest 4 states in the US. First do you agree that those 4 guilds have the largest number of members of any guilds on the servers? There are 435 members in the house and between CA (53), Texas (32), NY (29), FL (25) which is 138 members or about 32%. Yet your arguement here seems to say that you think that Montana with 1 member in the house should have the same power as CA? Nope Wrong again so quit trying to use that comparision here when it is in exact opposite to what you are stating. When enough Guilds (i.e. states) feel there issue that requires regulation and laws that all states should abide by they get together, talk about it and make a decision and post it here. The one thing different is that they do not force their regulations and laws upon Guilds but allow them to choose to follow them or not. <br>
<br>
2. Also consider that Guild Leaders are your representatives in this Government. Now based on the membership numbers of guilds, guilds with the largest membership have the greatest voice. While you as in individual might be able to express an opinion about something to the RTA, only the Guild Leaders can vote on it. The large the guild the more thier vote matters in something. A regulation was passed where few guilds decided they needed a private board together and  they got together, voted on it and made it happen. Yes, there were one or 2 smaller guilds or voiced an opposition to this, but the bill and law passed based on the larger guilds with more votes in the system. Thus every arguement you used to counter this was actually showed support for it based on what you stated as the &quot;democratic way&quot;.<br>
<br>
3. I can quote a shit load where you were asking for accountability of people here and the Guild Leaders are accountable to the members of their Guild, NOT TO YOU OR ANYONE ON THE RTA. You seemed to miss this point completely. You seem to want others to be accountable to you here and have yet to use a good reason for it. Maybe is is because you have such a poor understanding of government and who is accountable to who in the US government. Is the representative from Texas accountable to the people of New Jersey? I think not. There have been a few guilds that have disbanded when the Guild Leaders did policies or decisions that effected members of their guild which a lot did not like SoT as an example and others before it. Public opinion got so bad that members started to complain a lot. That is the way the game and RTA works.<br>
<br>
4. Each rotation mob and plane mobs can be considered something like interstate agreement or something that effects more then 1 state (i.e. guild). Now if you don't have commerce with other states (i.e. on a rotation) then you are not involved in the discussions or laws that are made on concerning them. If you decided that you want trade with another state then you have to abide by the laws and regulations they have setup not make new ones each time. Once you agree to this then you are open to voice your opinion about changes you feel might be needed to the system. To see how this system works and example look at the voting going on now about changes to the Plane of Hate.<br>
<br>
So in summary:<br>
<br>
1. You are a idiot who does not even know how the US government is about or how it works, yet are trying to use it in your arguments. You seem to like to pick sentences and facts to meet your own needs without looking at the full picture and intent of our founding fathers. <br>
<br>
2. You think the Freedom of Information act should allow the public to view all Government documents and information, so you should be able to here. Wrong on both accounts as I showed you. <br>
<br>
3. You are one of those stupid people who try to force your minority opinion upon the majority. You stated that you felt it was a minority trying to impose their opinion on a majority when it is in fact opposite of that. Oh doubt your opinion is a minority? Read the post here. So if you really believe what you stated then know that your voice has been heard, it has been found to be a minority opinion and lacking, now go away. This post has shown that the people requesting the Elemental forum to be opened is a minority so any more post you do will just affirm that you are a hypocrite who does not practices what they preach.<br>
<br>
4. The RTA is not the US government nor will it ever be so quit trying to compare them. The RTA also does not force their laws and regulations upon you, which you have stated a few times that they are trying to do. You don't have to follow them at all, unlike the US laws but beware that you will have all the other Guilds against you which have agreed to them. I am a firm believer in support the RTA and also supporting individual players in the game if you read my post before on asking players to leave a zone. I believe in truth, justice and the American way, while all of your posts are in complete opposition to the American way because you don't know what it really is.<br>
<br>
5. Use of the terms idiot and stupid are not used as a flame here when they are the truth. Now be quiet and go away.<br>
<br>
Sorry I really was not going to post more on this subject, but I really hate ignorant idiots who believe they know know how the USA government works or what is best for the USA, but don't have a clue about what the USA is really about. It is the United <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>States</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> of America. The USA is not a democracy’s and never will be, it is a Republic of States. Ever say the Pledge of Allegiance? Notice how it starts? &quot;I Pledge Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>to the Republic for which it stands.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->&quot; <br>

I'm guessing you are republican?  And, what / who is your republican buddies saying to vote for in the next election?  Oh wait, nm ...I can guess ...<br>
<br>
I'm not even going to re-quote it ...but all of your Electoral College and democracy vs. republic discussion, while correct, is irrelevant.  Who here is asking for a popular vote of who should be President of the RTA?<br>
<br>
Nice tutorial on the American Government, though.  You've done an outstanding job!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now how are the States represented in our Government? With the House of Representatives it is done up so every state is given a number of representatives in the house that is based on the states population, which is approximately one member for every 600,000 people. The Senate is made up of 2 Senators from every State.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->...and ...the RTA has two branches of government ...the Legislative branch (made up of a fixed 2 or 3 people from each guild who are actively on any rotation ...our Senate) and we have what might be construed as the Judicial branch in the RTA Admins.  We have no Executive branch ...there is no President or Vice President of the RTA.  <br>
<br>
Where is our House of Representatives?  We don't have one.  Where IS the system that validates your argument that 'larger guilds' have a 'larger vote'?  There is no such system ...2 or 3 reps for each guild ...all with, supposedly, equal say in matters pertaining to the RTA.  Without a House of Representatives, you simply cannot argue that A_LARGE_GUILD00 has more of a vote in any matter concerning the RTA than any other guild.  Reminds me of when I say to my daughter, &quot;I'm the daddy so I will always get one more vote than you, no matter how many votes you get&quot; ...not exactly a fair system.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When the Seventeenth Amendment was passed in 1913, making senators directly electable by the people, we turned senators into nothing more than representatives with longer terms, special interest &quot;$&quot; puppets and bigger egos that don't represent the interests of their state.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yeah, I can see your point here ...damn those amendments for putting the power into the hands of the stupid people.  wtf?  It is completely obvious to me now ...'making senators directly electable by the people' has a correlation to senators being 'nothing more than representatives with longer terms, special interest &quot;$&quot; puppets and bigger egos that don't represent the interests of their state'.  You aren't just a little biased in your representation of FACTS, are you Pressto?  Sheez, I could hardly tell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Based on this while you see every State might be represented, their voice in the Government is not equal to every other state in voting powers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You can only make this statement and apply it here if a House of Representatives is present, which it apparently isn't.  We have no such organization that bases its membership on a 'per capita' concept nor do we have a system recognizing the majority vote.  No one other than a very few people were even given a choice in the matter of the Elem Planes forum, it most certainly didn't get passed through the RTA Reps.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The large guilds have many more people then smaller guilds and therefore have a bigger voice in the house part of the Government, but smaller guilds still have a voice also, which you can consider their Senators. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->...and if the RTA system of government was established on a 'per capita' basis, you would have a valid point.  It isn't, therefore, you don't.  One Rep, One Vote ...that is, assuming that we used majority vote to determine things ...which we don't.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There are 435 members in the house and between CA (53), Texas (32), NY (29), FL (25) which is 138 members or about 32%. Yet your arguement here seems to say that you think that Montana with 1 member in the house should have the same power as CA?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->... and yet, your argument says that 32% is enough to dictate law to the rest of the country?  The entire House of Representatives argument is based on something that simply doesn't happen here, the majority vote.  In our RTA system, we have a reasonably equal number of Senate representing each member guild ...BoTS might have 3 representatives, but then, so might United Necros.  The point being that this issue was never taken to our Legislative branch, it was passed right to -I'm assuming- the Judiciary branch and approved with no legislative approval.  That, Pressto, is called &quot;catering to special interests&quot;.  As a Republican, you probably know what that is already ...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When enough Guilds (i.e. states) feel there issue that requires regulation and laws that all states should abide by they get together, talk about it and make a decision and post it here.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Wrong.  &quot;When enough guilds...&quot; assumes some kind of majority vote among ALL of the guilds (i.e. states).  Federal law requires approval by majority from each of the 3 branches of government, elected and appointed officials from every state in the Union.  This is simply not the case on the RTA.  What we have here is like CA, TX, NY, and FL getting together and making a no-smoking law for the rest of the country, they write the bill, they agree on the bill, they pass the law ...everyone else in the country follows in line whether they smoke or not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Each rotation mob and plane mobs can be considered something like interstate agreement or something that effects more then 1 state (i.e. guild). Now if you don't have commerce with other states (i.e. on a rotation) then you are not involved in the discussions or laws that are made on concerning them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Damn, don't suppose you knew ...among the powers granted to Congress in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution is the power to regulate interstate commerce.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>. I am a firm believer in support the RTA and also supporting individual players in the game if you read my post before on asking players to leave a zone. I believe in truth, justice and the American way, while all of your posts are in complete opposition to the American way because you don't know what it really is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Wtg ...can I call you &quot;Captain America&quot; from now on?  You obviously know your shit about American Government ...too bad the translation left a little to be desired relating it to what we have here on the RTA.  Find a House of Representatives or a majority vote within 2000 miles of the RTA ...then we can talk. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->These are stupid ideas and these people should be given a damn good thrashing with a clue stick.<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.clanbashemded.org" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.clanbashemded.org/images/rigsig.gif" style="border:0;height:150;width:300;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=438887" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;font-family:verdana;font-size:x-small;">Magelo Profile</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=patmcrotch>patmcrotch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Get it? <br>
