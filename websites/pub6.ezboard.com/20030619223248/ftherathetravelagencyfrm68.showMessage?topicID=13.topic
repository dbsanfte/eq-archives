Logging to 'eqlog.txt' is now *ON*.<br>
US: Ok, putting together a group for an Iraq raid...who's in? <br>
UK: Of course I'm in. <br>
Turkey: Only if someone makes me new armor. Last Iraq raid I lost money on. <br>
US: *sigh* Ok, I can't make your cultural armor, but I'll help pay for it. How much you need? <br>
Turkey: 100k plat. <br>
US: ***?! Are you smithing the armor out of platinum, ya tard? No frikking way. 30k plat,and that's all I'm offering. <br>
Turkey: Sweet. Ok, I'm in. <br>
Spain: I frikking hate Iraq. They were spawn campin us for frikking EVER, man -- long time ago, but we're still pissed off about it. Meet you at Turkish zone line. <br>
US: Cool, thx. <br>
Italy: Me 2. <br>
Chile: I'm in. <br>
US: Ok, so far, got US, UK, Turks, Spain, Italy, Chile. <br>
Bulgaria: Umm, got room for some lowbies? Thought maybe we could leech some raid xp ... <br>
US: Yeah, sure. Why not. Just don't attack anything. Make sure to set up a /assist US hotkey, ok? <br>
France: Hey all, what's up? <br>
US: Putting together a raid, hitting Iraq. <br>
France: No frikking way, dood. Look, I'm part of Alliance leadership, and I say no way do we go inthere. I'm using Alliance veto. <br>
US: ***? Alliance Veto? <br>
France: Yeah, it's in the guild charter. Me, Germany, <br>
US, Russia, and China can all cancel any guild raid event. <br>
Bulgaria: Hey, me and the other Eastern Europeans wanna go ... <br>
France: ****, n00b. Your guild got no say in this. <br>
Bulgaria: ,,!,, <br>
Germany: I don't really want to go either. <br>
US: ... <br>
France: Yeah, we veto. No guildies go to Iraq. <br>
US: What about you, Russia. <br>
Russia: Well, if everyone else goes, it's ok, but if France and Germany say no, then that's cool. <br>
US: Jeebus. Dood, show some balls. You used to lovegoing on raids. <br>
Russia: Yeah, but that Afghanistan raid a while back was a disaster. Total group wipe-out. <br>
US: Yeah, but you were in different alliance, man. This is different. Besides, we pwn3d last time wewent on Iraq raid. <br>
France: Doesn't matter. I say no. <br>
Spain: .tell US doesn't matter if France doesn't go anyway, he just feigns death anytime he sees combat. He's a bu77munch. Lives next door to me. <br>
Spain: Oops. MT. <br>
France: Oh yeah? Well you skipped that WWII raidcompletely. <br>
Spain: Only cuz I'd just come back from dueling, was too tired to raid. Besides, you died in first wave, spent the rest of the raid licking dirt and whining. <br>
France: ..!.. <br>
US: Guys, c'mon. I'm trying to put this thing together, here... look, I don't care what France says. I'm going, and anyone who wants to come with me can. China, you in? <br>
China: *shrug* Don't feel like it. <br>
US: Ok... <br>
North Korea has challenged you to a duel! Type /duel <br>
accept to accept or /duel decline to decline the challenge. <br>
US: /duel decline <br>
North Korea tells you: &quot;Dood u r teh suq. I will r0xxorz u&quot; <br>
You tell North Korea: No thanks, guy. Trying to get a raid going. <br>
North Korea tells you: &quot;Ur just scaerd of teh pwnage&quot; <br>
You tell North Korea: Riiiigh. ****, okay? I'm busy. <br>
North Korea taunts you. <br>
/ignore North Korea. <br>
US: How come you're not coming, Germany? <br>
Germany: I'm just not into the violence anymore. <br>
You tell Germany: Bullsh1t, you're just waiting for us to go into Iraq so you can gank France again. <br>
Germany tells you: Ooops. *blush* busted!! <br>
You tell Germany: Dude, why bother? He's green to you. <br>
Germany tells you: It's just satisfying, I guess. It shuts him up for a while, anyway. <br>
France: I'm telling you, if anyone goes, then it'll break the Alliance. <br>
Spain tells you: Whoop-de-sh1t, this Alliance sucks. Let's go anyways. <br>
US: France, *** is ur problem? <br>
France: I want to send scouts in first. Let them seeif any named are up. <br>
US: Ok, how long it gonna take them? <br>
France: Couple weeks, maybe. Months, possibly. <br>
US: MONTHS? ***???! Dude, I don't want to wait that long. I'll give your scouts a week, at most. We'll reschedule then. <br>
France: I may veto anyway. <br>
US: Yeah, whatever. <br>
/tell Spain Yeah, may have to. He's a dipsh1t. <br>
Bulgaria tells you: If you go, let me know. Me and my lowbie buddies are in. <br>
You tell Bulgaria: Cool, thx. Are you someone's alt? <br>
Bulgaria tells you: Some of us were Russia's buff toons, but we're soloing now. <br>
US: Ok, meet again next week. We'll take things from there.<br>
