Now I remember why I have had you on ignore for so long in game, and wish the same list extended here, but here goes:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Karadin said:&quot;Bush Sr started the first Persian Gulf war&quot;<br>
<br>
yup Bush senior invaded Kuwait and forced the Saudis and Kuwait and the UN to beg the US for help<br>

stick to RTA policy, you're usually flawless and without reproach there bud... on this topic you're floundering and sound more and more foolish each post.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
My example fits, if you weren't such a moron.  Bush started our involvement in the first Gulf War, just as Roosevelt started our involvement in WW II.  There is no difference.  Obviously Bush didn't make Saddam invade Iraq any more than Roosevelt forced Hitler or Hirohito to do what they did.  However, both leaders were responsible for leading the United States into armed conflict.  Then, as now, someone's political party or leaning has nothing to do with being pro or anti-war, this war or any other war.  Labeling someone a &quot;liberal&quot; or a &quot;conservative&quot; has no relevance in a discussion about whether they support a war or not, this war or any war.  <br>
<br>
It helps to make sure you understand what someone is saying before putting your foot in your mouth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karadin>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM<BR>

The coalition formed last time paid so much of the bill for the war, that the US only wound up paying something on the order of $80 billion, out of a total $1.2 trillion or something.  So it does make a bit of difference.  I do agree the US usually foots more of the bill for international security, but having a coalition does help defray the costs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grommofbots>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 273<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/19/03 4:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Only 3 countries have supplied combat troops on the ground, the rest are just cheerleaders.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
1st, yes i'm french/swiss and against this war .... in this states...<br>
<br>
2nd, i'm tirred to see so many comment of poeple who only mean with wath their own gvt/media say...<br>
<br>
me... even if my english is bad, i can read and understand what say both side... i can read what say ur papers, my papers, then i can use my memorie of this region history to make my brain work...<br>
<br>
now, what i see is some american who only speak about thing they trust in like in God because their president and media say it...<br>
<br>
what's the point?<br>
<br>
in 79, french have sell 2 nuclear plant (not weapon, note that), that was immediatly bombed by israel... then, french have, like many other (USA, England, Germany, Russia and China) have sell regular weapon, including bomb, airplane, tank etc...<br>
in 82, with Iran begin his islamic revolution, all occidental gvt have help irak who make them a horrible war...<br>
in those same years, Germany and England have sell chimical product, that was transformed in weapon by Irak, then England have secretly build a chimical factory there (this is now a scandale in england btw) , Saddam have use those weapon against Iran, iran have do the same... Saddam have use those weapon against his own people (kurd) but NOBODY, at least no gvt have protest...<br>
now, com the end of iran/irak war... irak is almost in bankrout and they must repay some billions to saudi and koweit, with koweit who sell more than his oil  opep quota, make the oil price faff (15$/barril !!!!!!) and exploit more than &quot;acceptable&quot; for irak a shared irak/koweit oil ressource, we are in 1990...<br>
here com a arabian opep council, where Koweit don't want to wait for reimbursement, don't even lower the pressure, so, the next day, Irak attack koweit, whole world and UN gather and begin the Gulf war...<br>
notice, saddam never have used chem/bio/nuke weapon in this war...<br>
so, we have internationnal coalition arround, rushing irak, american call kurd and chiite to revolt... and when koweit is free, with french the more to north and the more closest of bagdad, the coalition chief (Bush father) saystop, don't go any further... and let saddam bomb kurd and chiite....<br>
UN call then 2 airplane restriction zona to north and south to protect kurd and chiite....<br>
UN make sanction, asking irak to disarm and PAY war damage to koweit....<br>
UN inspection work well, till 98, when saddam kick them... why did he kick them? he asked UN to replace US inspector, because they only are there to spy... (1 of those inspector aggred that some of them where only there to spy)... he didn't say, i don't want inspector at all... he just have ask for inspector there to inspect, not to spy... with this fact, US and England don't aggree and begin to bomb some &quot;strategic??&quot; target...<br>
in those year after gulf war, Russia and France made a vocal aggrement with irak, that they will obtain exploit right on certain oil ressource once UN sanction fade and ONLY if same leader still in irak (that mean saddam)...<br>
here com 9/11... whole world gather arround US, and agree on afganistan war...<br>
where com 9/11 from? ossama was angred of US military stay in saudi... some kind of crazyness too...<br>
ossama was trained by CIA for russia-afganistan ...<br>
ossama hate US, and all non full religious arabian gvt<br>
ossama got his monney from part of heritage and many donation of supporter (some from saudi, note that)<br>
so... US make afganistan war, kick away the taliban (thanx for humanity) but fail to catch any of the al-qaida boss or even the taliban boss<br>
here com the new prob...<br>
maybee in strategic option, maybee in political strategie, Bush now want to DISARM irak... (disarm is the word used at begining) and the whole UN security council agree on that...<br>
note that US wanted to attack immediatly but agreed on 1441 resolution...<br>
now, we have inspector who go there, begin their work with some difficult at begining...<br>
after some UN warning, irak coopere a little more, and much more with US army begining to gather arround...<br>
now, UN inspector say they can work... not perfect but they can work... they ask for anything, and irak leader agree, maybee with difficulty, but they can work... and found any bio/chem/nuke weapon, only some empty ammunition and new missile with 30km more range than allowed, those missile are destroyed at inspector demand... 5 each day...<br>
now, from US/britain point, com some charge that saddam lie, cheat... but they're UNABLE to show proofs that are real (document show by brit as a irak mass destruction state in 2000 that was in reallity writte by a californian student in 80!!!, writte agrement about uranium purchase in niger that is a false, satellite pic showing some new building anywhere near an &quot;chemical factory&quot;, inspector go there and NO new building at all, and some other thing like that)<br>
we understand that US (and brit who want to follow US) really want to attack irak, no matter what...<br>
about french position... they writted the 1441 with US, they asked irak to disarm... now, com the moment where US show they want attack, whatever irak agree to do... then, since French agreed on 1441 to disarm, they want to let irak a chance to do it...<br>
irak begin to disarm; UN inspector say, we don't have found any mass destruction yet ==&gt; french say, okay, we can wait and see what do irak after... in mind, if inspector have proof irak cheat, lets begin military action...<br>
US who was thinking that France was on peace position only till the last moment, begin to be pissed, because, for french, war is possible only if we have proof that irak cheat/lie or don't coopere...<br>
that's why France try to gather other country, and menace with Veto a new resolution that allow war... at this moment, since irak coopere...<br>
here com the US gvt critic on France, with a full media threatening...<br>
here com too the fact that France agree that saddam is a tyrrant and must leave irak leadership... now, remeber the vocal agrement about oil... only if same leader still...<br>
no more oil agrement with that...<br>
the french (and many other country) position is that in disarmement target, war isn't necessary right now, since we don't have ANY proof that irak cheat/lie...<br>
then, we don't allow US coalition to make the war IN THE NAME OF THE WORLD, that would be the case with UN Security Council (call that UNSC, that shorter) resolution of war... that's why France mean they have to use the Veto... if they can't gather UNSC majority... and we see, majority still want to continue inspection for the moment...<br>
now, in case irak use chem/bio weapon against US coalition, this is a proof that they cheat/lie... not that France will send help/military or whatever, but hey don't stop resolution anymore... even if we think that a war will kill so many innocent to only kick a leader off...<br>
...<br>
u can make easily a war without us... but u will need our help to make the peace...<br>
<br>
about those ww2 thing... yes, we have been owned... yes, US have make a great part of the freedom work, and yes, french gvt allowed all power to marechal Petain, who asked in emergency for an armistice... yes, at nuremberg council, french and brit have allow Hitler to anex Sudete, even if they know he will not stop with that... why did they do that... because, knowing Hitler will soon or late attack them, they wanted to get more weapon... France wasn't ready, England neither, but the Manche was more usefull to block the nazy than the magino line... (magino line was designed to go from Switzerland to North sea to be really usefull, but was stopped near luxemburg to don't make both luxemburg and belgium angry, and nazy have turn magino line by north... moving through luxembourg and begium...) england, with the economic/material support of US get forces to resist while german was occuped in france...<br>
since japan attacked US, u declar war to japan and his ally, Germany... then com the history, with normandie and some other thing... so, yes we thank u for being free after that... but that don't make us contrain to blind follow u wherever u go...<br>
<br>
just think that maybee, ur leader don't have only irak disarm for target...<br>
<br>
since saudi arabia, even if their gvt is ur ally, have so many people in that hate u and support terrorist, ur gvt may need to get a good strategic position, and secured oil ressource... why...<br>
yes, 80% of oil u use com from form US... but the last 20% com from Gulf... and some other land use gulf oil. If u try now to make pressure on saudi arabia, oil price jump, world economy fall.., then US economy fall too... that's too expensive to only get some people in arabia down...<br>
with irak as ally/colony, US can move their army base for arabia to irak, and make pressure on saudi, providing oil to the world to hold price down...<br>
<br>
it is where u com back to war against terrorism...<br>
it is the strategic option<br>
<br>
now, the polical strategie... US gvt fail to catch al-qaida boss ==&gt; maybee we can use irak to make a diversion and show some win to US people and won next election...<br>
<br>
maybee both thing at same time...<br>
<br>
<br>
now, just think 1 thing... almost all of u, u only get what other want by ur media translate... and it's easy to only translate what is good as proof of own opinion... no need to change the words... just translate what u need...<br>
<br>
Now... since ur gvt is really about to make this war, i just hope 3 things...<br>
1st, that u don't loose to many soldier in this war<br>
2nd, that u don't kill too many people in irak (no clean war exist, colateral damage is the rules) to get the objectif 8kick saddam and his ally<br>
3rd, that u have luck and don't got too many terrorist attack in US... (they can't hate u more than now, but more hate u, that make more terroriste, more probability of terrorist attack)<br>
<br>
and, let's hope u really make anything for the palestinian/israel problem... note here, only terrorisme support we all know form irak is a bounty for palestinian kamikaze familly... nothing other... not that i agree on that, but we can't say irak have anything to do woth al-qaida with only that...<br>
<br>
btw... like i said earlier, my english is bad, so if u want to bash french, at least use logical point...<br>
and if it still a problem, answer in french, mine is very good... so i may laugh too...<br>

So basically you are saying that we are doing *more* than what is *necessary* in regards to force here, correct?<br>

So let it be written, but at least we aren't sitting around any more with our thumbs up our asses.  Regardless of when or why we finally decided to do something, I'm proud that we are taking a stand and finally doing something about people like Saddam Hussein.<br>

I'm sure the monetary cost of this will be a horrible burden, but does that mean that we should not proceed?  Does it mean that we should wait another 12 years whilst we let a lunatic amass anything he so desires right under our noses?<br>

Well for the most part your post was far better than your previous ones, but have you ever stopped to think-you say you're capable of this-that the people you're meeting who agree with what their President and media say HAVE LISTENED to both side, HAVE UNDERSTOOD both sides and HAVE MADE A CHOICE to agree with them.<br>
<br>
Everyone is entitled to make up their own minds and guess what some of us, in this case a lot of us, disagree with the French position on this matter.  I happen to think with good reason.<br>
<br>
Sorry I can't post in French so you could laugh at my inabilities.  If English is your second language you're really doing fairly well (far better than I am at any language I tried to learn).<br>

&quot;Both. Resolution 678 was made in 1990. Resolution 1441 was made in 2002. Twelve years of nothing but continued sanctions and no fly zones. He kicked out the inspectors, he gassed the Kurds, and the world community, US or otherwise did what exactly? Nothing. This slid to a backburner issue at best, both by the UN, the US administration, and the general public.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what to take from this statement.  Are you saying because nothing has been done in the last 12 years that it shouldn't be done now?  Granted - This should have been taken care of awhile ago when it was clearly evident that Saddam was not complying to the sanctions handed down, but how does that devalue what is currently happening.  I would think by your comment that you would say - &quot;Damn right, about time we held him to task for not complying and lying about it.  12 years have been enough of a time period for him to get his shit in gear&quot;.<br>
<br>
And there have been many resolutions in between these years, but they have all been doomed to failure because of the money that EU has tied up in Iraq.<br>
<br>
But 911 changed all of that.  The US made a pledge, not only to it's citizens, but to all the citizens of the free world that we would lead the charge to rid the world of terrorism.  The US has finally held the UN to task, and rightfully so, about the Iraqi situation.  But since once again the inept UN, held powerless by its own weight and its members vastly different agendas, are sitting the fence again, the US is ready to take the international hit to its rep and pocket book and do what should have been done a long time ago.<br>

Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said Tuesday that Spain would not send combat troops to fight alongside the United States and Britain in the expected war on Iraq. Instead, he said, Spain would send a hospital ship, army engineers who could defuse land mines, and other Spanish troops trained in decontaminating nuclear, chemical or biological attacks.<br>
<br>
That's straight from CNN yesterday, and straight from the Prime Minister of Spain.  No Spanish combat troops.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you go do the search in my previous post, you'll find that there are resolutions in *every* year between 1991 and 2003 that concern the situation with Iraq. Not exactly back-burner to me. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I did just that, and out of 750+ resolutions, no resolutions were made in 92-93, and I could only find 23 resolutions in 94 - 99, all but four about selling oil for humanitarian aid, and one about paying Iraqi nationals back for land lost to Kuwait.  None of them speaking of anything beyond &quot;severe consequences&quot; and most of them not even that (many deal with Iraq having issues with the oil economy and needing to sell more barrels than was allowed to make up shortfall in barrel price), and certainly nothing of &quot;all means necessary&quot;.  Compare that to the buildup to the first Gulf war, and the last 5 months, and yes, it became very much a back burner issue.  To attempt to say that for 12 years we have been waiting at this high level of expectation with the immediate threat of force in Saddam's face is a big stretch.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if the resolutions in 1991 are the approval for using force, I have two questions:<br>
<br>
1)  Why are we 12 years past the deadline of 15 January 1991?  (Which is before the first Gulf War occured, and could be interpreted to mean that the force authorized in those resolutions was already executed in the first Gulf War, and why a new resolution was sought.)<br>
<br>
2)  Why did the US persue, and then abandon, an additional resolution that would authorize force?<br>
<br>
3)  Why is everyone in the current US administration pointing at UN Resolution 1441, and not one of the 1990 or 1991 resolutions?<br>

If the US didn't need further approval, they wouldn't have spent the 3 weeks drawing up another resolution and campaigning so hard to get it approved.  UN resolution 1441 doesn't authorize force, and that is the one the US administration is pointing at justifying their actions.<br>

No, what I was saying had nothing to do with any of this, simply that the original poster was off base in what he had to say about the French position and possible and apparent (to the uneducated) reversal of their stance.<br>
<br>
However, in regards to your question, the issue is not are we doing more or not isn't the right question, it's are we authorized under international law to be doing what we are about to do.  Has Iraq attacked us?  No.  Are they imminently about to?  No.  Has the UN authorized force?  No.  Right or wrong, support it or not, it's not a justified war in the eyes of the majority of the international community.<br>

Can you explain what that means?  I read it to mean that Iraq will remain a sovereign power, with no loss of territory or leadership.  I.e. Saddam is not to be touched, just his WMD.<br>

<br>
No what I'm saying is that the only time progress is made with Saddam is when he has a shitload of asskicking staring him in the face, and even then its amazingly slow.  However, that doesn't mean people can claim &quot;we've been waiting at this fever pitch for 12 years, and its gotta end.&quot;  I'm with you, this situation should have been handled by 1994-1995 at the latest, that is plenty of time to dispose of the WMD, verify it was done, and remove the sanctions.  However, the US, the UN, in fact the whole world, has done a whole lot of nothing about this, and those who try and argue that we've kept up all this pressure are incorrect.<br>

You chose to pick apart, stupidly and beside the point I might add (since the point was that being pro or anti-war has nothing to do with your political party or outlook), decided to try and pick apart what you saw as factual flaws.  Bush did start the first Persian Gulf war, the fighting was all done between Iraq and Kuwait, no bullets flying, then along came the US-led coalition, and started bombing Iraq (justified by UN resolution).  Without Bush Sr's leadership and decision to pursue a course of forceful action, the first Persian Gulf war would not have happened.  I realize this is repetitive, but since you are a moron, I felt it only fair to make the point multiple times, so that you could pick the one that you understand easiest.<br>

I'm sure you can find much more detailed quotes, and maybe a few from cnn.com.<br>
<br>
But it is primarily from:<br>
Pierre Salinger et al, Secret Dossier, Penguin Books,1991, p. 58.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shortly thereafter, with a hundred thousand Iraqi troops massed on Kuwait's border, John Kelly, representing the Bush Administration, testified before the Middle East subcommittee of the House of Representatives discussing our response should Iraq invade Kuwait. Below, I quote from Pierre Salinger's book Secret Dossier on the exchange that took place between Representative Lee Hamilton and Mr. Kelly. <br>
Representative Hamilton starts the questioning: <br>
&quot;Defense Secretary Richard Cheney has been quoted in the press as saying that the United States was committed to going to the defense of Kuwait if she were attacked. Is that exactly what was said? Could Mr. Kelly clarify this?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know the quotation to which you refer, but I have confidence in the administration's position on this matter. We don't have any defense treaty with the Gulf states. That's clear. We support the independence and security of all friendly states in the region ... We call for a peaceful solution to all disputes, and we think that the sovereignty of every state in the Gulf must be respected.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If, for example, Iraq crossed the Kuwaiti border, for whatever reason, what would our position be regarding the use of American forces?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's the kind of hypothetical question I cannot enter into. Suffice it to say that we would be extremely concerned, but I cannot venture into the realms of hypothesis.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If such a thing should happen, though, is it correct to say that we have no treaty, no commitment, which would oblige us to use American forces?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's exactly right.&quot; <br>
<br>
Pierre Salinger then noted:<br>
&quot;John Kelly's statements were broadcast on the World Service of the BBC and were heard in Baghdad. At a crucial hour, when war and peace hung in the balance, Kelly had sent Saddam Hussein a signal that could be read as a pledge that the United States would not intervene. In the recent history of American diplomacy there had been only one other example of such a serious miscalculation, and that was Secretary of State Dean Acheson's statement to Congress in 1950 that &quot;South Korea was not part of the United States' zone of defense.&quot; Soon afterwards North Korea had invaded the South.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
John Quincy Adams, America's 6th President, wrote:<br>
&quot;America goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. ... She well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own, were they even the banners of foreign independence, she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standards of freedom. The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force.&quot; <br>

However, hospital ships and the like are support.  If nothing else, they free up resources from the three countries who are sending troops to be used elsewhere (maybe in Afghanistan).  Many countries are allowing the use of airspace and/or bases to conduct operations (even Germany is allowing this).<br>
<br>
Why did the USA try to drum up support with another resolution then drop it?  Well, let me explain it to you.... politics.  It would look *much* better for the USA to get the UN behind them in this.  That was the reason to drum up the support with another resolution.  However, France (who has veto power) said that they would veto it and anything like it even though there was wide support for it.  As far as I can remember, the proposal had support to pass except for France and Germany (who said they'd veto it).  So, the point was kind of moot.  Why continue with the resolution when a veto power has said that they would unconditionally veto it.  Kind of sounds like wasted time/effort.  Bush eventually said that we would do it without their support.<br>
<br>
Why is everyone talking about the latest resolution and not the others?  I have seen folks talking about the older ones.  I don't know why they talk about &quot;only&quot; that one.  When they talk about &quot;any means necessary&quot;, which means military force, they are talking about the 1991 resolution as it is the one that authorizes its use.<br>
<br>
Someone said that no attention had been paid to the Iraq situation from 1991 until 2002.  There are lots of resolutions from year to year (except 1992) that are dealing with the Iraq situation.  That is far from being on the &quot;backburner&quot; even if a lot of the resolutions are about humanitarian aid.  There are lots of issues to deal with, you cannot say that the sum-total of the Iraq situation is X.  Many people have been watching the Iraq situation the whole time (as evidenced by the many resolutions).<br>
<br>
Many people (in the USA) see it as:<br>
Has Iraq attacked us?<br>
Yes, through their ties with terrorist organizations.<br>
Are they imminently about to?<br>
Possibly, through those terrorist organizations.<br>
Has the UN authorized force?<br>
Yes, through UN Security Council Resolution 678.<br>
<br>
Of course, we could just sit around and wait until we are sure that Iraq has nuclear weapons along with other WMD, then there would be nothing we could do about it because it would be another nuclear power with an insane, power-mad leader who hates the USA.  I don't like war either but I'd rather deal with it now than then.<br>

Sounds like:<br>

Actually the proposal never got the nine votes it would have required, so they dropped it.  Had it gotten nine votes, yes France would have vetoed it, but it would have been a victory for Bush anyway &quot;Hey, everyone wants to do it, but France is being bleh&quot;.  When they didn't get the nine votes, they dropped asking for it, and France was quick to point out that there was no majority of the SC in support of it.<br>

Bush cites UN Res 1441, not 678, same with Powell, Rumsfield, etc.  They seem to understand something about 678 being not enough to consider this supported by the UN - hence the &quot;we'll do this on our own&quot;.  You can't have both, UN support, and the claim, &quot;we're doing this on our own with a coalition of the willing&quot;.<br>

I agree with you, under no circumstance should Iraq be allowed to have nukes.  Even with only modest conventional forces he has proven to be too much a maverick for the international community to deal with effectively.  That doesn't mean I don't think we rushed it this time around.<br>
