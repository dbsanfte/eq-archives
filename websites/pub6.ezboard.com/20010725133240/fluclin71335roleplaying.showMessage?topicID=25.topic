Senior Agent Mumsley Thunderfoot Reporting<br>
<br>
Sugarfoot Deeppockets has gone missing!<br>
<br>
It was said she was taking her usual early morning stroll through the Misty Thicket with her close friend Gingerhopp Diggs, when Sugarfoot, daughter of the honorable Mac Deeppockets, was attacked by a fierce troll....right in our very own Misty Thicket!<br>
<br>
Gingerhopp fainted dead away at the sight of the horrible troll, who snatched up the screaming, kicking, Sugarfoot and vanished.  Sugarfoot's current fate is unknown, however with an assailant with dietary habits such as trolls are known to have there is very little hope that she is still alive.<br>
<br>
Young Sugarfoot was a prominant member of the Rivervale Catillion, North End Chapter, chairperson for the Young Coalition for the Embetterment of Bixie Relations, and the youngest member ever of the North End Back-Stitch Needlepoint and Embroidery Circle.  Her friends recall her as a sweet caring young halfling who had impeccable grace and manners.  She is the daughter of Mac Deeppockets, a prominent member of one of the Vale's most influential and respected families.<br>
<br>
Mayor Gubbins had the following to say regarding the incident:  &quot;This is a terrible terrible tragedy.  Sugarfoot was beloved by all and her father is simply heartbroken.  Happy hour on Wednesday nights in the Fool's Gold will never be the same in the Vale again!  Even Lendel's Grand Lager will never taste the same.  I, your duly elected mayor and representative of the fine people of the Vale, swear that by any and all means the killer will be brought to justice!&quot;  After this he became tearstricken and could not continue.<br>
<br>
Gingerhopp has yet to recover from a severe onset of shock and is under the constant watch of friends and family as Priestess Hendi Mrubble nurses her back to health.  From her mutterings while in shock, we have thus far been able to determine that the attacker was a troll, but no further information has been obtained.  When Gingerhopp recovers she will be interviewed to discover more details about her attacker.  A followup report will be issued as soon as the information is received<br>
<br>
This incident is the latest occurance in a string of mysterious vanishings, bringing the total number of disappearances to four halflings that have now vanished during the course of the last month.  The motives of the assailant have yet to be determined.<br>
<br>
Sherrif Roglio has temporarily doubled the number of patrolling Marshals in the Thicket until the attacker is found and has assigned Marshal Anrey to organize the full resources of the elite Leatherfoot Raiders toward the ending of these murders.  Several agents have been recalled from the field to assist in scouring the Vale.<br>
<br>
If any halfling should provide key information or assistance leading to the apprehension of the assailant, a reward has been offered such that they will be immediately granted honorary membership in the Leatherfoot Raiders and receive the much prized Leatherfoot Raider Skullcap.  Mumsley Thunderfoot has been appointed the director of public relations in this important matter and will serve as the point of contact for all public inquiries and reports.<br>

<br>
It seems the goblins of the Citadel are planning an attack on the vale and are running short on funds.<br>
<br>
The mention of a Troll was not discussed but you may want to start inquiring the Goblins of the Citadel for information leading to her kidnapping and return. I do hope she is alright, as I am familiar, being a Wood Elf, with the Trolls eating habits.<br>
<br>
I do hope this will help in the safe return of young Sugarfoot and bring her captures to justice.<br>
<br>
If a hunting party is to be formed to capture and question the goblins of the Citadel please let me know for I would be willing to assist in this valiant effort. <p><FONT SIZE="+1">Be Safe!  Have Fun! No Dying!</FONT><BR>

Being hungry at the time I was getting ready to eat her, then she said her father was very very rich and his name was Mac Deeppockets.  Deciding I would be able to buy a good sword with the money to kill dwarves (I am a sucker for Dwarfie Pickles.)  I am holding her in a secret place until my demands are met.  I will feed her halfling parts in the meantime... (she thinks it is wolf, and she agrees quite tasty.)<br>
My Demands are as follows:<br>
50 Dwarfie Pickles<br>
AND ONE MILLION COPPER HAHAHAHA!!!<br>
<br>
If these demands are not met I will shave all of the hair off of her feet!!!  Then I will hand her over to the Clerics at the Spires of Innoruuk, they love halflings, the more sacrifices the better. <p><FONT COLOR="RED">

<br>
While I was neither born nor raised in Rivervale, and, indeed hale from faraway Kelethin, I was touched by the beauty, peace and laughter that seemed to bubble out of Rivervale the very first time I saw it. Indeed, I have come to view Rivervale as a second home.<br>
<br>
While I cannot countenance paying in the coin of Dwarvish pickles, and am dubious indeed about paying ransom of any kind to one of the dark, I stand ready to assist the denizens of the Vale, with spell, lore, track, and blade!<br>
<br>
Whispered aside (in average Thieves Cant) to the Vale only: <br>
Aye, I speak the tongue; some know the tale of how a servant of Tunare came to speak it; suffice to say I am sworn as are all rogues -- err.. Gentlemen and Lady Privateers not to teach it to others. Now... perhaps it is the influence of Mumsley, perhaps I am beginning to think such as thee as I speak as one of you. If we promised a downpayment -- perhaps 10,000 copper in order to see her, and ensure that she is all right, and that no halfling would harm him... well, I am no halfling, and 10,000 copper would weigh a warrior down nicely! Tunare forgive me, but I would countenance a little duplicity without outright oathbreaking in order to save an innocent! I can also call upon my elven brothers and sisters to assist! <br>
