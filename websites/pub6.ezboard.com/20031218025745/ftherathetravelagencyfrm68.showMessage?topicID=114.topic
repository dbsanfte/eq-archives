<br>
The news article below is about North Korea. Now tell me something....<br>
<br>
Where does the food go? it gets distributed by the government to enforce its own polices of keeping the population under control, people loyal to the dictator get mroe food then people who are agaisnt who get nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Read the article, its not bias, just draw your own conclusions. <br>
<br>
Me personally its a reason not to give to charities that do foreign work. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
From BBC<br>
UN calls for N Korea food aid<br>
 <br>
 <br>
About 700,000 North Korean children are malnourished <br>
The UN is launching an appeal for more than $200m in aid to deal with a &quot;chronic emergency&quot; in North Korea. <br>
A UN co-ordinator said that despite better harvests, the North still faced tremendous food shortages, poverty and a precarious health care system. <br>
<br>
The World Food Programme's Rick Corsino in Pyongyang said contributions from traditionally large donors such as the US and Japan had declined since 2001, <br>
<br>
Competing demands and a row over the North's nuclear plans hit donations. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;By all measures, (North Korea) remains a country in need of massive humanitarian support. The consequences of doing nothing are very substantial. If there's no response, or too weak a response, parts of the country will very likely revert to a food crisis,&quot; Mr Corsino said. <br>
<br>
Only 57% of the $225m 15 UN agencies asked for in 2003 has so far been pledged. <br>
<br>
The majority of the amount the UN is asking for - $192m - is needed for food. <br>
<br>
&quot;There is not a question in anyone's mind that is familiar with the country and has visited there that there is simply not enough food in the DPRK (North Korea),&quot; Mr Corsino said. <br>
<br>
North Korea is in the midst of a &quot;chronic emergency&quot; without a clear end in sight,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
Pierrette Vu Thi, Unicef's representative in North Korea, said 40% of children were malnourished last year, compared to 60% in 1998. <br>
<br>
But she said about 70,000 children among the 23-million strong population were still malnourished and were at risk of death without medical care. <br>
<br>
Mr Corsino added that aid was not just needed for crisis management, but to encourage tentative economic reforms which began last November. <br>

<br>
In my USAF training we studied how some governments will raid the relief food and medicine to either <br>
<br>
1)sell to make themselves more money--often selling to the people they are repressing and the food was originally intended for! <br>
<br>
2)Use to feed thier armies, which keep them in power<br>
<br>
3)just get rid of/let spoil, because a starving man is working to keep him and his family fedd and hasn't the time or energy to take up arms against his oppressor.<br>
<br>
This happens not only with UNICEF, but with the Red Cross and many honest relief efforts as well.  It's not the organizations intent, but it's happening regardless.<br>
<br>
Sometimes its not enough to just feed the hungry.  Sometimes we also send in the guys with the guns to ensure the hungry folks eat.<br>
<br>
Yet look at Iraq and how well supported that is. <p>Salura Ater'Mors<br>

Focus upon ones that are oriented towards 1 on 1 type relationships.  UNICEF has an abysmal history of allowing a large percentage of the fund being eaten by the overhead of teh UN program itself.  Then they are notorious for allowing funds to be spent on non-food items.<br>
<br>
Look at the Food for Fuel progam the UN ran for Iraq. BILLIONS spent on Castles adn Palaces and Bunkers.  Billions spent on administration.  300,000 dead from malnutrition.  Great Job UN. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One Charity that has a GOOD record.  Christian Children's Fund.  Low overhead.  No money spent for fund collecting.  (United Way will loose 20% to people that collect money for them professionally for example).  High rate of MONEY TO CHILD directly in terms of food schooling clothing medicines.  They have been doing this a LONG time and audit after audit, investigation after invvestigation, turns up the same results.  They do it RIGHT. <p>Mixyplix Targeth<br>

Wait a second!! Weren't they there to find &quot;Weapons of mass destruction&quot; that were never found?! <br>
Nevermind all the other agendas being served (oil and installing a puppet government, for highly debated examples). You're not allowed to change the purpose of a &quot;war&quot; right in the middle of it then pretend that's the reason it started! Can you?<br>
That's like saying troops were sent into Veitnam to bring all the little Vietnamese children candy and toys. While that's a nice thought, you and I both know that's not why they were there.

I wasn't specifically referreing to any one particular campaign.  In fact, I was really thinking about the problems in Africa when I made the comment about sending the guys with guns to ensure people eat.<br>
<br>
Yes, we went into Iraq with the stated purpose of &quot;Rooting out terrorism&quot; with the sub objectives or finding WMD, terrorist training camps etc.<br>
<br>
And if that's all we had done, we as a nation would have completed our mission, but lost the war.<br>
<br>
I'm really glad we are working to establish a democracy in Iraq, depose a inhumane leader who has repressed his people and squandered thier resources.<br>
<br>
By rebuilding Iraq, we are *trying* to make up for our blunder from the last Gulf War, where we did what we said we'd do (get Hussain out of Kuwait) and we left.  then what happened?  Millions of people were murdered and they were wondering WTF did America do for us?<br>
<br>
Hopefully, this time, we do it right.  And when the coalition pulls out, Iraq is a much better place than it was before we got there.  But I don't expect anyone to thank the coalition, ever.<br>
<br>
So yes, the objective of the war has made a transition.  I'm glad it has. <p>Salura Ater'Mors<br>

We did what we had to do....and really only did it after we were personally attacked.  Sure we had 'Advisors' helping before that but we were happy to sit back and let the war run its course until Japan make the mistake of the century.<br>

After France fell, like a freaking house of cards, the US was providing BILLIONS to England in food, clothing, medicine, and atricles that were not directly military in nature allowing England to shift its MASSIVE industrial plants to mainly military production.  This went on for a LONG time before anyone attacked us.<br>
<br>
Personally FDR was horibly wrong by not getting invovled as soon as England did.  Odds are we could have saved MILLIONS of lives had we been proactive instead of reactive.  When Poland was invaded the English took action.  The biggest mistake of the English was allowing the appeasers in Belgium and Holland prevent them from defending the northern French border like it shoudl have been.<br>
<br>
You cannot appease a totalitarian dictator.  When you do millions die.  You root them out and kill them or yank their teeth so much they cannot function.<br>
<br>
But hey 300,000 bodies found in mass graves is meaningless to some people.  They just want to have a group hug.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Mixyplix Targeth<br>

For the most part, if the US had been allowed to stay on the sidelines (and had done so), Europe would belong to either Hitler's reich or the USSR.  Considering Stalin's record, I can't really say one would be a serious improvement over the other though.<br>
<br>
To compare to that, Saddam had already proven his intent when he waltzed into Quwait.  Had he been able to do the same to Iran, there's not a doubt in my mind that he would have.  After that was consolidated, who would have been next on his aggressive expansionist policy?  Jordan?  Saudi?  Syria?<br>
<br>
The difference between Saddam and Hitler is that we got to Saddam BEFORE it got out of control.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260261">Barrd Talespinner</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Don't get me wrong; as I posted above, I think France and Russia are the biggest Assclowns for their entire stance before and after (if you can say its over - Which I don't think it is) this war.  Just not because we helped fight a world war on their shores 60 years ago.<br>

Funny, Monroe tried to warn us (he was all for &quot;isolationism&quot;).<br>
Funny, we Americans have, what we believe to be a good thing.  And we try to share it with the world, or at least make sure the world doesn't take our &quot;good thing&quot; away.  And everyone hates us for it. <p>Salura Ater'Mors<br>

The US Economy is Global, PERIOD.  Since the end of the Clinton Presidency we are importing 40% of our oil.  That means even the simplest silliness (say the Argentinian riots in the Summer) can cause our Economy to go into fits.  As we are at the mercy of dictators all over teh world we have to maintain some sort of control over them, even if it is implied threat.<br>
<br>
I am no warmonger.  But I am also not willing to trash my lifestyle just to avoid conflicts with pety third world dictators that try to use their natural resources to hurt us at a whim. <br>
<br>
Isolationism in 1780 was easy.  It was a one month boat ride to get here.  No one was able to maintain a war from that distance.  Anyone think the US forces were ever a match for the Brits is insane.  They had 2,000 mile suplpy lines to deal with during Horse and Buggy and Sail ships days.  Now we can get fresh fruits from Thailand delivered to Atlanta faster than they can deliver it to their own markets.  The entire world is just minutes apart anymore.  Isolationism can be said that we are not going to worry about fights on other planets or the moon.  You cant hide from your nextdoor neighbor and right now Iraq is just a few hours away.  They are closer to us now than Georgia was to Maine in the time of Monroe.<br>
<br>
Was it not Monroe that said for Europe to stay out of the Western Hemisphere? (or was it just the Northwestern part?)<br>
<br>
Anyway, we can't hide.  19 assholes in 4 planes proved that true.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
