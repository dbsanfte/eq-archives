Hey thats all cool with me if you guys want to go down the beaten path HC went. I just wont have any part of it. No matter how much you pay for a toon truth is the toon is made by guild effort not just your own. At least when I played Xienna and decided to quit at level 59 I offered her to the guild and Levlenna wanted to atleast pay me for the CDs to load the game and that was that. <br> This wouldn't have gone as far as it had if Vryu/Blaal did not delete NO DROP armor which the guild had given to me.

That could have very well been done with the best of intentions.  My one question is what were your intentions when you came back?  Perhaps attempts to steal the account back without consent?<br><br>Also you talk about getting things you haven't earned.  If I remember correctly Xienna had pretty crappy equipment when you quit...correct me if I'm wrong but Blaal has very good equipment? (Obtained from BotS right?)  This in itself would give you a warrior far better than the one you had without earning any of it (you have told everyone that your true goal was to have Blaal for yourself right?)...yet you claim it is VoF that &quot;goes down the beaten path&quot; of ebay?<br><br>It's sad that two friends would fight this way.  Vol, you have come on many boards now claiming that Vryu did this for sure, but honestly how can you know?
