A yes or a no answer will do, along with any minor changes you might wish to see to this.  Flame on this thread and i will delete that part of the post, this will be a calm discussion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>

<br>
Proposal to solve the situation of BB guild members being invited by entities whom have the planes the day the god is up:<br>
<br>
-  Under normal circumstances where no epic loot is to be obtained ANY posting alliance may send 1 to 6 members to the planes if invited to do so by the entity whom holds claim to the plane that day.  <br>
<br>
-  In the event that at any time there is a god in the plane, BB guild members have one of two choices:<br>
<br>
1) Remove all BB guild member forces whom are not up on the current rotation, allow the current entity whom holds the plains rights to sink or swim without intervention.  If the entity in question is unable to defeat the god on their own, the BB guild currently on rotation is to be notified under whatever guidelines are set for that process at the time.<br>
<br>
2) 1 to 6 members of a BB guild may stay in the zone if a god is up, however if ANY god epic loot is obtained by ANY member of a BB guild who is not currently on rotation, that is considered as a forefit of the guild's NEXT rotation slot.<br>
<br>
Meaning if the current lineup is like this (hypothetical)<br>
<br>
BoTS<br>
MFH<br>
KEG<br>
FR<br>
DBN<br>
CIW<br>
BOTS<br>
MFH<br>
KEG<br>
FR<br>
DBN<br>
CIW<br>
<br>
and say a FR (hypothetical) member is present in the zone at the time of the slaying of an epic mob and recieves loot, then the rotation looks like this<br>
<br>
BoTS<br>
MFH<br>
KEG<br>
DBN<br>
CIW<br>
BOTS<br>
MFH<br>
KEG<br>
FR<br>
DBN<br>
CIW<br>
<br>
Under these rules it is possible for an epic guild to decide if the rotation is the line which they want to follow, or if they wish to rely on obtaining their epic loot via invitation from friends.  It also ensures that should an epic guild member obtain epic loot, that other epic guilds will not have a problem due to the fact that the loot obtaining guild no longer is in the current rotation.<br>
<br>
This is the best for all parties involved i think, if someone can find an alteration that will appease the BB guilds if this does not pass then i am all ears. <p><font color = green size = 4> Manas Pineblade, Stalker reborn<br>

This is in place (for non-epic guilds) so that spawns are not wasted.<br>
<br>
Leave it to the epic guilds to determine rotation, rules, restrictions and penalties.<br>
<br>
If the epic guilds want to have rules beyond a simple rotation, they can damn well figure it out on their own.<br>
<br>
The epic guilds wanted this.  Let them figure it out.  I've got better things to do than handhold a bunch of goddamn infants who can't keep a civil tongue in their heads long enough to hammer out a set of rules that they'll all agree to.  <br>
<br>
Am I the only one who watched Sesame Street as a kid?  <br>
<br>
SHARING IS HARD.<br>
<br>
Do what you want.  If I go up on a raid of fear/hate and a god is up, I know my alliance will come here, see who is at the top of the list, and tell 'em to get their butts in and kill the god.  Whatever other rules the epics put in place don't matter.<br>

<br>
This is need be reworded.  Epic loot can drop on any planes raid.  Vampire Blood for enchanter epic is a rare drop of Revanants in Hate and a piece for the warrior epic drops from the golems in Fear.  As well as the Iksar broodling for the shaman epic.  All 3 of these can drop everyday.  <br>
<br>
The rotation is basically just for the god dropped epic items.<br>

Edited the request to reflect the fact that god drops are what is in question here.<br>

It goes to the hosting guild and the invites are there are friends to see that that guild has the help they need or to have friends just to be there.<br>
<br>
If we should invite 6 friends from a guild that has BB status, you are telling us that those 6 friends who we trust and enjoy having with us have to leave cause they can't enjoy the game and help the guild. I'm dead set against this part of they plan. If I take the time to bring friends to the planes I would like to be able to bring any friend that my guild asks.

The problem is if these friends are from an epic guld. <br>
<br>
This is a loop hole in the current system, an epic guild can ask to send a group of 6 *friends* in exchange for epic loot. Most feel that a group of 6 very experienced very well equiped characters can make or break the attempt on the god, thus abusing the system and getting more epic loot for themselves.<br>
<br>
The rule you site isn't currently in effect.  I think Jairn, Baldruss and the DBN in there were imposing this on themselves to try to stay within the intent of the Calendar even though that's not exactly what the rules say. It's what they believe to be the right thing to do =)<br>

Jairn, Baldruss, Tallwin, Tsunnami, Viercia, and DBN are great friends to SON. They have done alot for us and when we go, we like to take them with us. I believe that we all learn from things that we do. I also believe that guilds that go should be allowed to take who they want but with the understanding that the guild gets the loot not invites. They come to help.<br>
<br>
I truely admire DBN. They have some of the greatest folks on the server and others could learn from them. Jairn, imho, is one in a billion. This man is fair and he is trustworthy, on top of that he has what you would call old style HONOR. And anytime I could take him and other DBNers with us I would love to not because we have to have them but because we consider them great friends and family. <p><img src="http://www.ratheseekers.com/board/terqsig.jpg" width="298" height="151"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxriya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xriya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>MFH</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/4/01 8:50:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_arrowdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  vote</span><hr size=1> I agree with B, Manas..

<br>
My only point is this:<br>
<br>
You're doing all the work for the epic guilds, who then get to pick apart the rules *you* worked on, without doing any work themselves.<br>
<br>
I say give the epics 2 weeks to talk amongst themselves and determine a ruleset that works for all of them, and if they can't do it, scrap the epic guild system.<br>
<br>
Look, if epic guilds want this extra-shot at god loot and whatnot, they need to do the work themselves.  Not you Manas, not Rewena, not anyone but them.  They have to make the rules they're going to use, and tell the rest of us what's up.<br>
<br>
If they can't even do THAT, then they can just get in line with the rest of us.  Simple fix:<br>
<br>
&quot;If a god is left up after a plane run, the posting guild loses reservation rights for 2 months.&quot;<br>
<br>
So if you go up, you better talk to keg, or CiW, or bots, or whoever, and make sure that the god goes down.  But no rotation.<br>
<br>
You said you wanted FFA qwai.  How about calendar for normal stuff, and FFA for calling in epics?  Sure seems like a good idea to me.  I'm sick of all this epic politics, grandstanding and bullshit.  You all know who you are.<br>
<br>
You can come here and post endless snipes &amp; whines and insults and flames, but when it comes time to actually talk about rules, you leave that for the 'stfu n00bz' to work out.<br>
<br>
And then bitch when the rules aren't to your liking.<br>
<br>
Screw it.  If the epics can't get their collective acts together enough to make clear rules for us to follow when we need to call someone in to kill cazic/inny, then let's go FFA on calling in big brother guilds.  Just make the list of who is a Big Brother guild and make it available so that people know who they CAN call in if they need the help.<br>

Screw the BB rotation, make it invite only.  CIW and BOTS will be able to get their share of epics if they can ASK once in a while.
