The RTA has so much influence on the Rathe and if done right you can actually get involved in stopping these loot crimes. This Forums is much more powerfull then a lot of people take it for. Why not let the looter repay the victim for their crime. And if they choose not to, then place their name on an a &quot;To Be Ignored by all List&quot; won't take effect for a while but in time words gona spread and people will think twice before commiting stupid acts. <br>

In general it is a great idea. I think everyone should have a chance to defend or compensate for a stupid or demeaning act. <br>
I do not see the RTA as the judge and jury. I do see it as a means to solve issues for those of us that beleive in the little system we got here. <br>
If something was set up with a voting-pole outcome I would be more likey to participate on that. Then just a firing squad mentality. <br>

If someone gets flamed, do they get added to the blacklist? How many people must agree with the flame before the flamer is considered to have a credible flame? What if those people have no credibility?<br>

This is a bad idea in practice.

<br>
No official list need be made I think.  People make up their minds about things and if important enough you'll remember.  I suspect there is a search function here as well if you want to check someone out.  The flames stand on their merit for each reader to decide if the flamee was justly or unjustly flamed.<br>
<br>
If someone is accused people can view the whole exchange, and using Fablaar thread as an example, can see the eventual outcome and make up their own minds.<br>
<br>
Official black ball lists usually lose their effectiveness due to abuse.  There rarely exists a mechanism for getting off of such a list as well.<br>
<br>
Of course it would be painful if someone started listing all the times someone has their alt trained in DS at NL zone because someone is not bright enough to avoid the mushrooms along the way from ME and unwilling to kill them after picking them up.  But the more eggregious (sp?) things get listed and I suspect people pay attention if it's important to them.<br>
<br>
Or so it seems to me<br>

<br>
The only way this would work if the victim notified the Looter or Kser that they would take them to an RTA court (hehe). A screenshot would also be neccessary of this, because the other party would have to be notified in order to defend them selves. Seems a lot of work, but if the crimes bother's you so much why not do a little to make sure it does not happen again. Flaming does do it's part but in time people forget and it happens again. A balck list would keep the Toons fresh in our minds. And I don't think the list would flood with names becasuse a lot off peeps will not waste their times to to do all this work. But some will, and most likely those some would be the victims of big crimes. <br>
<br>
Anyways What do you guys think of the new patch, I heard that the bazaar has problems now, a lot of crashes.<br>

Lets say my group was in seb one night at guard, and a crypt group moved in and killed the guardian on their way to the crypt. Let's say i was being really bitchy that day and decided to come to the RTA and chew that group out... their names go on the black list as camp jumpers.. and then their reputations dwindle.<br>
<br>
The people in that group are out looking for guilds, earning respect in their current guild, people to group with, people to trust, friends to make.. and because they are on the list for one simple transgression (that was only listed because i was being pissy) they will be treated badly by the majority of the server and it will never blow over because their names are listed in a perm place.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are instances of repeat offenders, or people who are just down right jerks.. but thing is, their names constantly come up here and the server community remembers them. <br>
<br>
I dunno, i just think it would do more harm then good... then, there's people like Jas who are trying to fix their bad reputations. If they are black listed - people will never forget.. <br>
<br>
I think, we should be a little more forgiving.... and not make everything black and white. <br>

<br>
I just don't think that the RTA should be a judge or jury for people playing this game.  We do some sort of 'Policing' by flaming those poeple that deserve it and by bringing awarness to those people that should be avoided or that has screwed someone over before.  That should be the extent of it.<br>
<br>
Just because we all post here on the RTA really doesn't make us a 'ruling council'. We are just the same as ever other Yahoo that plays EQ....No better or worse.  We all just enjoy the server board and community parts of EQ along with the game.<br>
<br>
Let's just all keep posting and warning other members of the Rathe when the situation is called for.<br>
