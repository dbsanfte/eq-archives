<br>
 You WILL want to read the whole thing so you dont look the fool, not knowing whats going on when we get there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Staging Strategy :<br>
<br>
We will be meeting at the secret entrance tunnel where attendace will commence at 5pm PST / 8pm EST. If it falls on a weekend it will be at - 3pm PST / 6pm EST. Attendance stops half an hour after that time.Pls be off anon or roleplay and put an LFG tag on for ease of identification. If you will be late be sure to inform us or post it here or your space will probably be filled by the time you get there. This in no means discourages latecomers, it encourages people to camp at the tunnel. Durring attendance pls refrain from drinking, emote spamming, or talking in open channels as much as possible. All it does is makes our job harder which means raid goes on longer which means you're up later, so dont do it.<br>
<br>
Resists will be a MINIMUM 70 cold and magic unbuffed.<br>
<br>
Attendance fee is 50pp each to go to enches and clerics for stones. When you enter the group pls give the money to your group leader. <br>
<br>
As soon as groups are assembled we will start moving into Permafrost 2 groups at a time. These 2 groups are called bunches. Each bunch is formed of a caster group and a tank group so everyone is safe. Because of how my method didn't work as well as planned from guild speech to the group leaders I will be doing all of this via shout speech.<br>
<br>
Example - g1 and g7 = bunch 1, g2 and g8 = bunch 2 and so on.<br>
<br>
All rolls are based on previous SB rules.<br>
<br>
Once we are all at the Kings Room, ALL casters with Bind WILL bind at the Binding rock. (the one tucked in the corner around the back, you will be shown) I want confirmation from all my group leaders that all casters have bound at this point. Since this is also the easiest time to do it, we will be doing the roll for the pallie book of scale at this time. Loot master will control all lotto's and will keep track of the highest 3 people for the book.<br>
*note* last time the loot master wasn't properly announced ahead of time but will be this time.<br>
<br>
We will then begin to pull the IG's.I will be asking Rexxor, 60 warrior if he can pull the giants for us to start since he has the best chance of pulling solo's. If he is willing we will then start pulling one by one. NO ONE is to pass the flags (you'll see them) when attacking, the mob will be brought to you, not you to them. I will be giving out warnings for passing the flags if you are not a designated puller. We will have a couple very high enches along with us and if we have multiples they will be charming so always use your /assist command. Main assist will be announced the day of the raid.<br>
<br>
When I get the &quot;all clear to move up&quot; signal, we will be moving up to the next room. Stay in this room and dont wander. There are pit traps everywhere and falling down one would mean almost instant death and a very hard CR, so dont wander. Everyone will form up in a U shape around the pull hallway. If you dont know which one it is then wait for instructions and you will be shown. No one is to be in the centre of the ring, all should be back towards the walls. When fighting the giants it is imperative to keep them off the walls. One of 2 things could happen if we dont. 1. the body could fall through the world and would be lost. 2. The IG could gate into Vox's lair at which point we would start to be summoned one by one. Either way not pretty.<br>
<br>
Once these IG's are clear the buff line people will be called ahead up the hallway to start the buff line. If you aren't called foreward then listen to commands and see what is to happen. We are allowing 2 full groups of 53+ers for support and IG control. If you have been called foreward to be buffed dont run back to help kill IG's, that is what our 53+ tanks and extra's are for. Let's get buff line done as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
Buff line coordinator and co coordinator TBA.<br>
<br>
BIND CLASSES - you WILL bind at the end of the buff line. Deaths are irrelevant when we have a lvl 60 cleric with his uber stick there to rez us. You dont bind, you dont roll. That seems fair to me.<br>
<br>
Vox Strategy :<br>
<br>
 Reform groups as quickly as possible upon return. We dont want buffs wearing off so this part will go reasonably quick. Mages are to use Fire pets.(highest dmg versus an ice creature)All other pets welcome and might want to find them an ice resist just in case if you can. *note* - all other pets - meaning ench, necro, sk.<br>
<br>
Triage Line - I believe the standard positioning for the triage line is one platform up on the ramp (correct me if I'm wrong) and so that is where it will be unless otherwise stated at the time. Healers are allowed to sacrifice cold resist to a minimum of 45 in favor of wisdom, no lower. If there are several druids, then those over 50 become nukers. This will be said in advance to prep your correct spells.<br>
<br>
I would like the 53+ healers to join the triage line as well. We will try an idea and see what happens. Goes like this - <br>
<br>
Cast CH, zone boot, gate. Cast CH, zone boot, gate - and so on.<br>
<br>
Using this method you guys should be able to get off another 4 or maybe even 5 heals each which would be HIGHLY beneficial overall to the raid.<br>
<br>
On the attack command ( I will do a lead up to it, ex. on your marks. Get set. ATTACK! all in different shouts) there will be only 2 waves of tanks. First wave will be warriors and Pallies. Second wave consisting of all other tanks, will run in 10 seconds later. DO NOT engage her near the doorway. Run to the middle of her chamber and begin fighting her there on the platform. *EDITED* Pets will be held back till the second wave of tanks. <br>
<br>
Tanks are to taunt until she turns on you then stop. Go back for a heal at 50% life or if you are hit by her. Be sure when leaving her that she's on someone else and not going to follow you out.<br>
<br>
At about 60% life I will call casters to rush. For some this is early, for others too late but after Nagafen I believe that if the casters had gone in a bit earlier we might have done that little bit more dmg to overweigh the regen, so casters are in at 60%. IF YOU DIE - mem up your offensive spell (or for healers your heal spell and get back to triage) and get back in there and keep nuking, dont stop, dont think about how many times you died, just get back in there. *note* and no your naked corpse does not poof after 3 minutes, it now lasts 3 hrs.* For every time we (as casters) die, we probably save a tank for another few seconds and that is what we HAVE to do. Mages Malosi and call when it lands pls.<br>
*note* Use fire or magic based spells to hit her. Also, her resistance is distance based, so in order to get a spell off on her you're gonna need to be standing underneath her.<br>
<br>
Enches - You're whole purpose in life here is to Mana sieve as much as you possibly can. As long as Vox has mana she can CH. If she does then I have about 5 seconds to decide if we have enough people left to keep going or quit, so sieve her dry cause I dont wanna make that choice.<br>
<br>
Healers &amp; Casters - If you are OOM - Run in and die, its the quickest way to get mana back and since you're getting a rez I shouldn't hear anyone complaining.<br>
<br>
Now if all goes well some lucky group will get a little yellow message on their screen about exp or something and we will have a chance to laugh over her dead corpse. Exp group looter will tell the lootmaster of all items and then let loot master deal with it from there.<br>
<br>
Aftermath :<br>
<br>
Do not deny a rez, thats a quick way to not get invited back again. As soon as rezzes are complete and not 1 minute before, all lotto's will be done. All rolls are based on previous SB rules. it is a random roll of 1 200. Dont practice rolls or roll twice, its rude, needless and I dont put up with it. (yes I can be a pain but none of us should have to listen to you spout off) If you roll wrong, roll again properly.<br>
<br>
*NOTES*<br>
<br>
I dont think I need to go over etiquet with you guys but we'll be brief about it anyway. Do not swear, emote spam, practice roll or make lewd comments. As some of you may have gathered I am very much against all of those and will be using the baseball method if I see or hear it. I believe 3 chances is more than enough to clean up behavior. If all 3 chances are used up you can be replaced on this raid. Next raid you can try again. Simple.<br>
<br>
We are going to try for at least 10 groups of attackers and are allowing 2 groups of 53+ers who can volunteer for buff line and IG control.They WILL be allowed to lotto since they used their mana or skills for the cause and to deny them would be truly unjust. Just because dragons cap at 52 doesn't mean we cant find a way to include everyone possible.<br>
<br>
If you bothered to read this whole thing and actually made it to the bottom I'm asking you to send me a tell in game just to tell me you read it so I know who to count on.<br>
<br>
The signup list at this point is still open, also, anyone who is the right lvls be sure to ask along and we can see how many people show. I dont think we have enough on the signup right now and if I dont get al least 9 groups there I will be calling it off for this run.<br>
<br>
C ya all on the inside and everyone cross their fingers.<br>

I didn't understand about pets. Anyway I usually don't make pets since we do them jsut before attacking Vox cause we jsut coem back from chat room. And it takes a lot of mana that can be saved for heals. That is for shamans, all the other pets are good to make. My point is that shamans shouldn't make their pet.<br>
 <br>
 Something else that was not clear to me. for healers in the triage line. You said that when you die you have to take your dmg spell and then go blast. That is only for tyhe nukers right not for the healers in healer s line? That must be obvious but I'm not sure... if I'm not wrong healers should die and get their heal spells not their Damage spell right?<br>

<br>
As a shaman I often am asked to debuff the tougher mobs at the start of the fight so as to make the killing go faster.  Would casting DOTs, debuffs and Slows have any effect on the dragons to help the raid?  I saw you mention casting Malosi (A primary debuff used by any good shaman).<br>
<br>
What about Incapacitate (AC, Str &amp; Agi debuff), Insidious Malady (Dis debuff) and Togor's Insects (Our best sublevel 50 slow) as far as debuffs?  And Plague (dis DOT) and Envenomed Bolt (Poi DOT) could be useful to avoid her regen if not actually hurt her much?<br>
<br>
Sorry if the questions seem silly but as a Shaman I can fill ALOT of roles and I just like to know what role I will be asked to use to help my group succeed.  Buffing, Debuffing, Healing and Nuking are all roles I am more then happy to accept.  Just point me in the right direction and give me my marching orders and I will do all within my power to see that the group succeeds.<br>

To put things in perspective - we have aproximately 4 minutes to kill her in (give or take a bit). If she doesn't go down within that time then we've probably lost too many tanks to continue and things can get hectic. Her combat regen can be outweighed by just 2 or 3 tanks on her at a time but its the extra ones that do her dmg and the casters blasting. If we all get lucky the enches would have drained her mana and she should have none left to work with for her CH. *crosses fingers*<br>
<br>
The dragons are like no other target you've ever killed before heh, but you'll see that come raid time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'm sure alot of you do as well. By the 30% mark in fact I'd prefer to have mages all out blast. If you can get under her belly I know I got off 3 bolts in a row into her stomach so I KNOW I can hit her with those where as my magic spells are all resisted. Vox is where we come into play cause I doubt (cant be sure but I believe) that no other caster has as strong of fire attack as we do so we become very important. I dont have much time thismorning or I'd change that up top but I will tonight when I get home from work.<br>

Since someone mentioned something (in another post) about healers/nukers basically run into the dragon lair when they are OOM &amp; get killed so they get FM fast...how about if every healer/nuker duel a tank once he/she runs out of mana?<br>
<br>
Under this strategy (I would call it the &quot;Slam Bam FM&quot; strategy...hehehe), a healer/caster will give a tell/ooc/shout to his/her dueling (tank) partner as soon as OOM. The tanks who will do this job can be assigned prior to the raid...each dueling tank will be assigned to maybe 1-3 healers/casters. Preferrably, the designated tanks for these duels would be those who are higher levels so that they can kill their dueling partners fast.<br>
<br>
I believe that this strategy will help to reduce exp lost for those healers/nukers. Besides, there will also be less rezzes to be done once the raid is over.<br>
<br>
However, there are two problems that I can see with having this strategy in place. First, there will always be a chance of the tank to miss the healer's/nuker's message to start dueling. Second, it will probably a little bit confusing on which corpses that need to be rezzed if the corpses of those who got killed by the dragon or other mobs are mixed with those who died because of duels. The second problem can almost be eliminated though if we designate an area as a dueling area.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's just my 2cp. I hope it is something that might help the raid. Thanks.<br>

If you count the time it takes to a) shout to die b) have a tank get there and both go into duel mode c) actually kill the healer and then d) the time to zone and come back, it almost defeats the purpose of it when they could have simply run in and bam, instant mana in under 10 seconds. The casters die much more often than the healers do usually, but there's almost no way to avoid that after a first death and all resists are gone. Its all on time, the faster we cut corners to save time the more dmg that can be done to the dragon. make sense at all?<br>
