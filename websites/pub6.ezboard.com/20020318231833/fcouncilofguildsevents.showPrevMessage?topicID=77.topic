<br>
Anyway, hello there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Just thought I would give a little recap of the raid.<br>
<br>
The raid started with 22 people which was actually good even though we were short a few tanks and clerics.  The fewer people you have to start with, the less time you spend for corpse recovery and res'ing from breakin. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->           The entire time we had around 2 dozen people in the zone which was great for lag and maneuverability.  <br>
<br>
Everyone was incredibly alert, understanding, NICE and willing to learn, and they did not let a few setbacks ruin their fun.  There were indeed setbacks, like when Cazic spawned on us and forced a repop of the entire zone about 1/3 of the way through the raid, causing us to start over and also causing many pesky death touches from that point forward.  Or when we got a train (trains happen no matter how careful you are) and wiped out the entire party, which happened several times.<br>
<br>
The list of attendees for breakin was:<br>
Zellex (monk)<br>
Kexian (ranger)<br>
Lirpa (enchanter)<br>
Sept (cleric)<br>
Ranstorm (warrior)<br>
Sinark (magician)<br>
Kartain (cleric)<br>
Cronis (ranger)<br>
Arkianus (necro)<br>
Dadan (ranger)<br>
Lionn (shaman)<br>
Mulerin (druid)<br>
Sprit (necro)<br>
Jzonn (ranger)<br>
Zekron (paladin)<br>
Amoss (druid)<br>
Reiss (druid)<br>
Malastik (wizard)<br>
Kangol (shaman)<br>
Larr (wizard)<br>
Kordail (shaman)<br>
Torc (monk)<br>
<br>
There were several people who came late and filled in the gaps as people left:<br>
Samaddor (warrior)<br>
Sarmaldor (wizard)<br>
Cloauk (rogue)<br>
Subidai (monk)<br>
Askeeranan (shadowknight)<br>
Juraevil (necro)<br>
Olympias (warrior)<br>
Etendards (cleric)<br>
Heii (paladin)<br>
Guroth (cleric)<br>
Ambil (monk)<br>
Wildberry (druid)<br>
<br>
This is what we obtained in the way of loot, which was a bit skimpy bit it was surely better than nothing.  Congrats to everyone who won something! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->         <br>

<br>
Special thanks to Zellex and Kexian for the great leadership, Torc for helping with pulls, Kordail for the Turgurs, Sept and Kartain for all the res's and being the only two clerics present for the entire raid, which lasted about 15 hours, Arkianus for being the best mana pump I've ever met, and to Reiss, Amoss and Wildberry for all the ports in and out.<br>
<br>
Thanks to EVERYONE who showed up and made this raid a success.  I hope we can do it again very soon.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->          <p><p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="3"><span style="background-color: #FFCC66"><font color="#660066">~

Roughly 70% of the people was new the planes, and we  technically broke in it twice with about 24 people.  Thanks to the entire plane respawning with the showing of Cazic.<br>
<br>
Cazic turned out to be a major set back in my opinion, because we had to re-kill all the creatures that popped again.  Also because he likes to zap people (instant death) either because he is protecting his little fellows or he is sick and twisted and enjoys killing people (You decide :P) )  And being short Tanks and Clerics, we couldn't take out Dracoliche who seems to enjoy telling Cazic we are here after he picks up the rumors from the various creatures that wander in the planes.  This also cut down the area of creatures I could pull, or least pull them in a timely manner.<br>
<br>
We had a few setup backs which is normal for the planes.  Our biggest problem (I'm not critizing anyone, just bringing this up because this is a learning experience) was pets on the wrong target.  Just something for you to keep in mind if your a pet caster, it is critical for you to keep your pet under control so our enchanter does get unneccessarily beat up and chews up all our clerics mana.<br>
<br>
I was also surpised at the number of no shows, roughly 18 people I expected to show up, didn't.  Oh well, live and learn.  I think I will invite up to 45 people next time, which should compensate for no shows.<br>
<br>
I would like to thank all who attending, and Harbingers for co-sponsoring this event.  I am going to organize my paperwork talk to a few people, then try to set up another one for PoF in two weeks.<br>
<br>
And my apologize to everyone for the skimpy treasure.  We technically had to kill the same creatures twice, yet it seems like we barely received treasure normally obtained in killing them once.  Oh well, just a little unlucky this time I guess.<br>

Personally, I died five times, but still managed to make about a half bubble of exp.  I didn't win any of the Ranger lottos, but I'm happy for those who did.  I have several screen shots.  Once I review them, converted to jpegs, and ordered; I'll get them somewhere for everyone to see.  I'm pleased to get some nice shots of Cazic and Draco (using Bind Sight).<br>
<br>
I was asked to lead one of the Fear groups and I consider it an honor to do so.  Lirpa had no knowledge of my abilities or temperment.  I did this function the whole time except for a brief stint when I had a major thunderstorm came across and knocked out power four times in a row (before I could get back into EQ).  Cronis led the group during this time and for a short time after (until he went LD).<br>
<br>
I signed on just after 1PM CST and hussled over to the Fear portal (I camped in Oggok at the end of my last EQ session).  We organized and prepped for the entry and my group (the second group to enter) went in at 3:11:10PM CST.  We made it to the north camp, but one of my group members (not sure who and it doesn't matter) aggroed several nasties over to the camp.  Kartain and I were alread at the camp and beginning the camp out, but we all died.  By 4:15PM CST everyone was ressed and we were prepping again.  We started the clear at around 4:45PM CST.  I spent my time practicing my hand-to-hand on the bouncers in Oggok.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
While still at the north camp, the party was wiped out by some roamers on the east side of Fear.  As I understand it, we stayed too long at the north camp after clearing out some of the west side.  This happened twice before we finally moved to the NW corner.  After moving to the NW corner, we cleared out some of the west side and then Cazic decided to make an appearance.  We made a mad dash back to the north camp and began the process of clearing the zone once again.  This time with the watchful eye of Cazic and his special welcome to anyone he discovers in his zone.<br>
<br>
We cleared the zone again with the occasional death touch (DT) from Cazic.  Only one time to he start chain DTing and we camped out after the first two.  We cleared and made it back to the NW corner.  At this point, Draco decided to roam around a bit.  Eventually, he made it to the area we were set up.  Unfortunately, he brought some friends along with him.  Any member Draco didn't get, his friends finished off.  One Cleric made it out safely and the ressing process began anew.<br>
<br>
The Monks resumed the pulling and it was pretty much standard pulling tactics.  They would pull things, Lirpa would mes the extras, and we would kill them as we could.  Every so often, there would be a breakdown and the group would be fighting multiples.  At one point, the main tank (Ranstorm) had to leave to eat.  I was asked to be the main tank.  *puffs up*  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It was quite exciting and a major challenge (more on this in the 'observations' section of this post).  Eventually, we cleared enough where we could move to the west camp.<br>
<br>
With the exception of one more pull where just about everyone died, the pulls were handled fine.  Somewhere in all of this, I stopped keeping track (time wise) of when things happened.  I knew what time it was, but I just stopped noting it.  More clears and we moved to a south camp next to the scareling tower.<br>
<br>
At the south tower we had our last major incident (before I left Fear).  Several Amy warriors were pulled and an immediate camp out was called.  I managed to make it out.  After we all were back in and everyone was ressed, we continued the pulls.  I started getting punchy at this point.  I still managed to go another hour and a half, but by 4AM CST, I was all spent (I had been up since 6AM the morning before).  After getting a port to Lava, I camped and went to bed.  And thus ended my first foray into the Plane of Fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;But what did you observe?&quot;, you may ask.  I'll tell ya.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
First, I think Lirpa, Zellek, and Kexian did an outstanding job in organizing and running the raid.  While I've done a lot of research on Fear, it is very nice to have someone there who knows what is going on.  I learned a lot on how an event like this could (and, I think, should) go.  Could I run one of these?  To an extent, yes.  I need a couple more under my belt to cover some things I've not experienced yet.<br>
<br>
Second, people need to learn to follow orders.  And I do not mean directions, I mean orders.  If people cannot follow an order, they don't need to be there.  There are a couple people who I would have rooted if I could have...*particularly* after Cazic spawned.  We also had a few loots done by someone who was the same class as the armor drops from that particular mob.  Nothing happened, it was just a standard order:  Don't loot a mob if it drops your classes armor.  And then a situation with people attacking a mob (in a multi-pull) before the main tank acquired a target.<br>
<br>
Third, it was very difficult to aquire a target to attack at times.  There would be times, after I had hit the assist hotkey three times, where I still didn't have a target to attack.  I could look and see the main tank hitting the mob in front of me and I would use my 'target nearest NPC' button and it wouldn't work.  *That* was frustrating.  There was also a lot of running around to follow a mob as it jumped from one area to another, particularly the scarelings.<br>
<br>
Fourth, the loot drops were terrible in comparison to what I had heard about for a normal Fear raid.  Certainly, I've heard of variations this low.  It's just disappointing to actually be on a raid where it happens.  This is not the fault of the event managers, though.  Just the way it works sometimes.<br>
<br>
Overall, I had a great time.  I ready to do it again.  Do I expect it to be the same every time?  Not on your life.  It will be a different challenge each time and I want to learn about them.  I met a bunch of people.  I lost a good bit of sleep.  I went through a lot of caffeine.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If you need my services again, just let me know. <p><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2 COLOR="#004080">Jzonn Stormwolf &lt;Avenging Crusaders&gt;</B></FONT><BR>

<br>
Secondly as a pet caster I made sure my pet was on the right target all the time with the exception of one where my pet took out a glare lord pet I beleive the order came to switch targets but when that happens, unfortunately if my pet is getting whacked he wont stop hitting the mob back. ACK! <br>
<br>
<br>
I think we did a great job considering that we had only 2 clerics for the most part( All the druids and shaman did excellent jobs) and 1 Chanter ( who did an phenomenal job) and were low on tanks. Our Monks were top notch pullers.<br>
<br>
I cant wait to do it again. Count me in anytime!<br>

On a personal note that I am proud of is that I only died 1 time and that was because I got disconnected before FD, which I felt was pretty cool since I came away with almost 3/4 bub exp in 15 hrs there.

(longer than expected)</span><hr size=1> Since this raid I've been on 3 or 4 more, maybe 5 I can't remember. We all know you can't get enough clerics in Fear due to nothing there for us to loot except the belt (and I still haven't gotten one). Anyway due to the downtime of the servers I figured now would be a good time to point out my observations.<br>
<br>
I've seen different ways of doing things on each raid and a few of them just seem to work better than others.<br>
<br>
1. Mass raid on break-in compared to group by group.<br>
a. Group by group seemed to work the best. Give the mob time to settle down and send in the next group just works the best hands down. <br>
b. By doing a mass gang-buster style break-in you end bringing all the mobs with you and kill whomever is already there camping. It only takes a few hits and the mobs move on to the next living person. Be it somebody half way through camp or somebody that's just making it there, 30 seconds is just to long to try to make it out using this style.<br>
<br>
2. This one is basically an observation of mine but if the situation should arise again maybe it'll be remembered.<br>
<br>
Last night we had a premo mix of people but myself I didn't think the grouping was exactly top-notch, not to say it was wrong but that I think it could have been better. We had a bard and 2 chanters, awesome I think. The primary chanter handled the buffs in her group and what others she could while the secondary handled the buffs for most everybody else. Both were run through the hoops on keeping everybody buffed. All this while the bard was busy playing manasong for our group which stayed almost FM the majority of the time, but one problem, no chanter in our group. I feel that if you have a bard and enchanter they should be in the same group so that the enchanter can keep up with the mana required to keep everybody buffed.<br>
<br>
3. Pet control.<br>
I've seen it on every raid, pet control is a REQUIREMENT!!! People please understand this. I know it's been stated over and over but there is a constant problem with pets. I don't have a solution to the problem but I've got a few ideas that may help some. The /assist command is essential to a successful mission. So far I've only used it one way, assist on the main tank. There may be another way to do this but not sure how well it would work. If all tanks hot keyed the main tank and each group member assist that groups main tank. As an example I'm in a group with Jzonn as the leader and the main tank is Damin (that's a scary thought already). I hot key Jzonn on my assist while he hot keys Damin. It may take a second more for everyone to get on target but that second may make the difference in getting on the right mob and not getting it. It may also have a side benefit. If the main tank goes LD we don't have a clue till somebody shouts it. Till then we sit and wait since we don't have a target, at least those of us that don't start nuking at the first sight of a mob. As the tanks get more used to how each other fight then you'll know if the main tank hasn't targeted the mob as quickly as he/she normally does. The secondary tank takes over here. Every group member doesn't have to keep up with who is who except for the tanks. If all the tanks are doing their job and are assisting the correct person then mob death should come as quickly as it had before the main tank went LD without a pet getting on the wrong mob. In theory I think it would work but don't know for fact that it will. The only real drawback to this is if the main tank of the group goes LD then the group is lost. Give me some feedback on this one and tell me what you think.<br>
<br>
(servers just came up. 11:28pm)<br>
<br>
4. When the shout goes out for &quot;Cleric camp&quot; don't yell &quot;Which one?&quot;, sit your ass down and camp! I've seen it happen 3 times already and all 3 times we ended up with no clerics camped due to only needing a few more seconds for the idiot cleric to camp. Those few seconds he took to yell &quot;Which one?&quot; would have given us a camped cleric. Also don't sit down under the mob and expect to camp. Back up at least a little ways to give you a better chance of camping, not too far mind you, just give yourself a little space. I know mobs summon you and they move around a lot but all casters should try something that I do. As long as the camp is broken and the way is clear then try to stay about 3/4 of your casting range out. Once you've been there a while (few times) you'll know where you can safely move around your camp without drawing in a mob. By staying in this range you can still nuke or heal without having to move yourself unless the mob has a major mental breakdown and moves half way across the planes. For a pure caster you may have to be less than 3/4 since I know a few of your spells have a wide range.<br>
<br>
5. Tanks.... geez guys, calm down!!!<br>
I've seen it over and over: &quot;INCOMING!!!!!&quot;. All tanks who are sitting stand up and move along with all the tanks who were standing towards the direction that we are pulling from. STOP IT!!!! First off you get out of range from your casters and we end up having to move. That takes our time out of medding for that last drop of mana to save your hide and also delays any heals that you need since the cleric is having to come your way. See item 4 for more reasons not to move. It's a range thang, remember that. Anyway we made it through that battle. Now, everybody back to the camp!!! Crap!! Why do I have to keep moving?? Let the pullers bring the mob to the camp, not take the camp to the mobs. Guess what?!?! That's why they are called pullers.<br>
<br>
6. Leaders<br>
Give more feedback on mana within the group. If somebody is below 50 then let the pullers know you need a bit more time or at least ask the person if they need more time. This doesn't count for unexpected mobs but rather just the mobs you know are being pulled. Clerics in this case are a strange lot. We buff till we are blue in the face there so at hardly any time will we be FM. If you have a good cleric then he'll damned sure tell you if he needs more time since he has an idea on how much healing he has had to do in the past within your group. He'll also be the seesaw in your works. One minute he's FM and the next he's OOM. How the hell you ask when nobody has been hit enough to need a heal? It's called buffs. I'll explain more about this in item 7. Back on topic. Leaders give more feedback on who is AFK within your group. If the camp is moving then DO NOT let the camp move till all of your members are back from AFK. It's happened every time I've been to the planes, somebody gets left in the old camp because they were AFK. Almost every time this has happened we'd end up with a few extra mobs to take care of since somebody got lost and is roaming around. &quot;WOW I made it.&quot; Oh yeah, I brought a few friends for us to kill. That just don't cut it most of the time.<br>
<br>
7. Clerics.<br>
Some of you clerics are gonna hate me for this one but YOU are giving some of us clerics a bad rap. We are not tanks or casters, we are healer and buffers and on occasion stunners. If you are not doing one of the three things I've mentioned as your job then you better be on your ass medding. Over and over I see &quot;Cleric OOM&quot; and I've sat there and watched the cleric nuke away all of his mana. Sure, throw in a few nukes once in a while to at least make us feel better but DO NOT blow all of your mana on nukes. If you are buffing, healing, and stunning correctly, you don't have a lot of extra mana to waste on nukes.<br>

8. Almost done. Hang with me a few more lines. The servers are back up you know. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (back down 12:13am, may have been down earlier I didn't check) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

9. Members.<br>
Give your leader an idea of how long you plan on staying. Be it 30 minutes or until it's over. Give people a chance to plan group movement before you leave. I know it's not always possible to predict when you have to leave due to real life situations but if at all possible don't wait till the last second to tell someone you are leaving. This also gives us an idea if you are coming back if you go LD. Give feedback to your group on anything you require which includes giving your mana report. If you are diseased, let somebody know. If you are buffless and shouldn't be, let somebody know. If you are at 20% mana, let somebody know. Communication is the key to a successful mission, please use it more. I could go on about this one for hours but I think you get my drift.<br>
<br>
Ok, so it turned into a book. If you finished this long outfit then tell me what you think. (servers still not up 12:48am) I'm open to suggestion and discussion on it. Add to, take from, no matter to me. I want what works best, no holds barred. Start a new thread with it. It may draw more attention and get more discussion that way. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
