Many times we had a train of giants cause people do not listen to what the leaders say.<br>
<br>
This was my second Vox raid so I am trying to make the comparison between these two. There are a couple of things that I would like to note,<br>
<br>
Try avoid /ooc and use /shout when is something important to say and use CAPS.<br>
<br>
People that don't listen send them a tell or shout &quot;Balendin move back or you are out of the raid&quot;.<br>
<br>
I wish he had more bards, their sv songs are more than great and maybe +55 people could join ONLY to buff us with higher resistances and buffs and not to fight of course. <br>
<br>
A different way to buff: have groups of five where...paladins and rangers cast junk spells, clerics/shamans join and use pack/group buffs, enchanters/druids join for group saves MR/CR e.t.c. when the buffing is done group1 camp...clarity/canibilize/manastone/rods e.t.c. casters gain their mana, buff the second group, group2 camp e.t.c...<br>
<br>
About the tactic that we used: Get ALL the tanks behind the boulder and I mean ALL. When you make sure that ALL the tanks are gathered together give the call. <br>
We moved in 2 groups with about 8 tanks, when Vox casted Fear instantly the tanks became 4 or 5, it is very difficult to hold a dragon with 4 tanks that are going to get slaughtered in less than 20 sec when the other groups are supposed to come. If you have 20 or more tanks attack at the same time, some of them will be feared but many will stay behind and hold the dragon effectively till fear wear off.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I believe that the most important thing is for ALL the tanks to attack Vox at the same time and not in groups.<br>
<br>
Everyone wants to hear the word Victory so let's work on that.<br>
<br>
p.s. We are going back to Vox one of these days to get 6 corpses that are left behind somewhere in the pits.....<br>

<br>
For starters, I would like to say THANKS to all that attended. HUGS! Dragon raids are challenging to even the most patient of people.  Note: Bamana is not one of the most patient, fortunately, Jzonn has enough patience for both of us.  Thank you Jzonn for allowing me at your side during this event.  <br>
<br>
I think that overall the raid went pretty well.  We had some factors against us from the beginning.  It is a major endeavor to round up 40 to 50 people with little notice and transport them to a somewhat remote location.  Thanks to all that spread the word about the raid and special thanks to those that made trips porting people from continent to continent.  <br>
<br>
The best advice for anyone attending a raid, is to LISTEN.  This is even more important for those who have little or no experience with raids and may not be familiar with the sequence of events. However, REGARDLESS, of your raid experience, you should still LISTEN. Also, please do not assume that this raid will be like the last raid.  Each raid leader has their own strategy, and at times they like to try new or different things, again you must LISTEN to know exactly what is going on. (I am not trying to get on a soapbox here, but I hear questions asked continuously that raid leaders have addressed in /shout or /ooc.)  <br>
As far as last night goes, we listened fairly well.  I have certainly been on raids where no one listened.  Can we improve, of course…that is why I expounded so much on listening. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Another important thing is PATIENCE!! I am not a patient person and find this a challenge.  However, in a raid situation, it is REQUIRED.  Organizing things take time.  This includes, getting information from those in attendance, waiting on latecomers, establishing groups, etc.  Reviewing the battle plan takes time. Organizing the buffs takes time.  Buffing itself eats a lot of time. And finally, the worst thing of all, corpse retrieval takes time.  If you don’t have the time to put into a raid, you shouldn’t come. (Exceptions are made at the raid leader’s discretion.)  We did pretty well with being patient last night.  We had lots of curves thrown to us, and we handled most of them OK.<br>
<br>
My Final rant erm comment is concerning Corpse Retrieval.  If you do not have the skill sets to pull bodies without aggroing the mob, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PULL.  This was the biggest problem I saw last night.  Everyone wanted their body and we had no Rogues.  (We were fortunate to acquire the assistance of two fine Monks who were in Permafrost but not part of our raid.)  Rangers do have the ability to Sneak and Hide, though they aren’t quite as accomplished as those sneaky Rogue fellows.  However, caster-types, SHOULD NOT attempt to pull corpses from within agro range of the mob.  Some of you may recall Lady Vox’s visit to the King Room…now you know how she got the invitation.  This is an important lesson for us all.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to Mondo (Grey Hawks) and Tarrok (Shadowed Fates) for assisting with Corpse Retrieval.  You guys are the best!<br>
