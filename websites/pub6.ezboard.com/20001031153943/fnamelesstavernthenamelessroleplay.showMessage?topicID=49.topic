Some Dark Elves tried to reclaim East Commons for themselves.  A few 30 warriors with a healer came to tunnel during the usual bazaar session and started kicking all light race newbie butt.  Joredin, Jeddite, and I laid waste to the little racists SoBs and sent them to their god.  Shout a few warnings that they shouldn't try it again.<br>
<br>
GM chickened out then I guess.  Didn't see hide nor hair of anything after event.  Kinda disapointed and let down.  Saw something promising start and got dropped like a hot potatoe cause someone didn't plan something all the way thru with contigencies like 3 50+  putting a end to a newbie massacre.  And we recieved no request to not interefere if this was truely geared towards lower levels.  We all know from past experiences we should step aside if that is the case, someone just has to let us know.<br>

The events I was running on the Nameless were not sanctioned or endorsed by Verant in anyway.<br>
<br>
You see, when I first began working at Verant last December, the climate for GMs was much different than it is today. GMs were more like DMs (dungeon masters) instead of customer service (which is all they do now). I was handed the reigns of the Solusek Ro server -- a server which was enriched with the roleplaying element by its two former GMs, Solist and Do`Vasirr. I continued the tradition by starting the struggle between Hideaki and his anti-thesis, Neudal. My guides were encouraged to roleplay this storyline, and many of them enjoyed what I was doing. In addition, I incoporated the private, existing continuity on Solusek Ro with the official Verant historic quests (Example: the Lanys T`Vyl storyline) and the results were incredibly satisfying for the players and guides involved. In fact, one Verant employee who plays anonymously on Solusek Ro, congratulated me on how well I handled the storyline and its presentation. Ultimately, it was the players that gave me the greatest satisfaction. They were digging what I was doing, and I enjoyed doing what a GM should be doing: making EverQuest a dynamic and exciting environment. <br>
<br>
When I was transferred to Namaless, I started from square one. This was a new server and I had a great opportunity to make a new storyline and set the tone for how the server would be perceived. I was also able to surround myself with some excellent guides who weren't just there to guide, they were there because they enjoyed doing what they were doing. And they were there because their GM was there to back them up and support them. Most importantly, their GM was someone they could call a friend out of game. Solist once told me that &quot;your guides are your lifeline&quot; and this is 100% true. I recall hearing the attitudes my fellow GMs and the Verant staff had towards the guides and guide program in general and being disgusted. I would say that most GMs looked down on their guides, often ignoring them or just talking down to them. This is why many servers have such bad support. The GMs simply don't care. My guides knew I cared, and it was because of this friendship that they came back everyday. <br>
<br>
I was also a very accessible GM. Many complained about my world emotes, duels with players, and nightly broadcasts. What was the reason behind this? Was I bored? Was I on a power trip? The answer is quite simple: I wanted the players to know that I was there and that the server was being watched. I would also go visit players as much as I could. I wanted you all to know that I was there if you needed me. Sure, I've been criticized for being a name nazi and being too harsh on players that cussed and that's ok. I believe EQ should have names that live up to the roleplaying experience, not names like &quot;Mini Mee&quot;. Cussing is always in bad taste over public channels, and while I have one of the dirtiest mouths out of game, I believed in keeping things clean in EQ.<br>
<br>
As for player events on the Nameless, at the time I started the Zenten, Gouka, and Shinobi -- there were NO Verant policies stating that I could not do such a thing. It was only until around March or April 2000 that Verant began getting anal retentive about what could and couldn't be done. They increasingly made it difficult for me to run dynamic quests that had purpose. Instead, they wanted GMs to run crap like from the 'approved quest pool' (example: Quest #1245 - Werewolves attack the E Commons). I would not have any of this, thus I began to silently break the rules when I could, to keep things fresh. In addition, I believed and still believe that Verant gives out incredibly bad loot for its quests. Whenever I did dynamic quests, I made sure &quot;good&quot; items were given out. After all, people are dying in these quests and that's hours of work (on a side note, when I was hired last September, did you know I was the only GM to have a legit level 50?). So, I could relate to players and gave out worthy items to those I thought stood out from the events. Yes, manastones, rubicite, even Planes gear were handed out. But before they were even considered, I would ask my guide staff for their approval. If someone thought I was being too generous, I would give something out of lesser value. It was this kind attitude and teamwork that made The Nameless something special in my mind.<br>
<br>
Toward the end of my run on Nameless, I can honestly say that I was unhappy. Verant and Sony were constantly throwing new restrictions on what GMs could and couldn't do. Guides were being banned and tossed from the guide program like the morning trash (coincidentally, guides are treated worse than players by Verant in some ways). The neverending witch hunts and office politics. The corruption by Verant management by having GM &quot;hook up their friends with everything and any level they wanted&quot; put a sour taste in my mouth. I know many other GMs felt the same and always felt like they could be fired at anytime because &quot;so and so doesn't like me -- I don't know why, he/she just never has&quot;. All in all, it was an extremely unhealthy working environment and me being terminated turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I could not be happier with my new job as a game developer (the company will remain anonymous) and my salary. GMs deserve better -- but they only deserve better if they care. Unfortunately, this is a quality many GMs lack (there are some good GMs out there - DeSani, Yakatizma, Garn, Mennix, Kyrani, Palladius, Jekh/Yeln, Vencor to name a few). Also, just because I've had a sour experience with Verant doesn't mean the entire staff is filled with bad apples. The development team cares about this game a lot and the individuals that comprise this team are all smart, honorable, and caring people (Bargash, Joe, Do`Vasirr, Solist, etc). Like many companies, Verant has its share of good and horrible individuals. I will not name these individuals, but I will say that these people have tainted my experience as a former employee of that company. All I can do is look back at the wonderful experiences I had with my guide team, fellow GMs/dev team people, and players. You guys were great! See you in EQ.<br>

<br>
As for the matter at hand.  Hideaki was *truely* one of my best friends in EQ.  I had no problem giving him a /tell with some sarcastic crap that made no sense.  We would mess with each others minds in anyway we could think of and I know Hideaki kept me entertained just as much or more then anyone else on the server.  I don't know if I could have made it through most of the things I've done without Hideaki and the guides.  Going 40 hours straight in fear is hard.  36 hours straight in the efreeti room waiting till everyone had a pair of boots is hard.  Seeing a guide or GM pop up just to say &quot;hi&quot; and give you crap sometimes wakes you up and even brings a smile to your face.  Hideaki didn't do me many favours, I couldn't /tell hideaki and get my body summoned out of Vox's lair.  In fact, he sat there and watched deadone and I run in and lose 2 levels a piece and laughed at us.  I personally took that as another reason to pick up another copper and make another run to help someone out and get there body.<br>
<br>
Hideaki's events where great, I rarely attended them near the end because as most of you guys have figured out by now, the &quot;high level&quot; players aren't exactly welcomed by the &quot;lower level&quot; players.  I did however participate in many of the events when the server was newer, and damn they where fun.  I remember being in the AM room one night, an SMR had never dropped on the server other then the kithicor quest for the opening of hate.  I think Kaedin had that SMR.  Anyway, I think the group was Saldor / Draed / Nagrakthor / Brieze / Sengir and I.  Suddenly we hear word of a GM event and the infamous Finger paint shouting taunts to the GM's thinking that he is the invicible fatass troll god.  Incomes a darkelf necro, Finger Paint is instantly killed by the Necro's power and the necro moves on.  Onto the Archmage room wearing an SMR.  When we saw her we all rushed out to keeeel.  I think brieze trained me with like 10 zols and a couple dars or something and I got rooted and owned pretty quickly lol.  &quot;Brieze! heal me!&quot; *Brieze runs off after the NPC* &quot;doh?&quot;  Anyway, they fight her, she instantly kills Draed and finally they finish her off and she drops an SMR.  Back in those days Saldor was still in CoH (wtf? lol) so we rolled for the robe and the bastard won )=  Cool thing that we brag about to this day was when the AM spawned (= killed it and got my robe =D 2 SMR's in 5 minutes? booyaw. beat that timing (=  I attended other events just for fun and they where great times.<br>
<br>
I have no complaints towards Valdelmar, I think he is a fine GM.  The thing I miss about Hideaki was that he was so easy to approach because we all knew him as a friend.  Seems like Verant is (like usual) being idiots and not allowing this kind of stuff anymore.  Its too bad that we lost such a great GM and so many great guides because of Verants homosexual policies.<br>
<br>
I remember long talks with Hideaki and the ability to /tell Hideaki good night! every night and get a response was just a cool thing I guess.  When verant put there head up there ass they screwed over a lot of people. <br>
 oh well =\  Just a few memories and fun times<br>

  I do believe you did your best to try and further an atmosphere that you believed was in the best interest of the server.<br>
  However, I believe one of the biggest problems with having a somewhat 'personal' stance toward a server and in particular people and/or guilds is that it becomes personal. The reasoning behind Verant's rules is to try and create a sense of impartiality and one of fairness. In the end, can you honestly say you were impartial towards players/guilds? <br>
  You had personal friends and people you did not care for. I will not bring up things from the past, but its obvious how certain events happened, and this did affect the server. This game is a lot about ego, and by feeding some, and not others you create even more of a caste system than already exists. <br>
  In any true professional chain-of-command there needs to be separation for impartiality. You cannot get personal in a situation like yours, and I believe it is the reason for you leaving Verant.  At the end you were not a neutral GM, you were Hideaki. This approach would be perfect for a small roleplaying group, unfortunately not for a GM on a large revenue generating generic Sony product.<br>
  I do believe you meant well and are a good person. Good luck in your new position!<br>

In all honesty, while there were players who provided me more interesting conversations/company than others, I, in no way never showed favoritism to one guild/player over another. And I know my guides will back me up on this 100%. <br>
<br>
If I logged on and had two guides telling me that there are 15+ petitions against XXXXX training people in Fear and using foul language, I'd find and watch him. <br>
<br>
If you are referring to the transfer of a certain no-drop item, well, I was under direct orders from &quot;Brad&quot; to do it. I opposed this situation and even took it to Jeff Butler (who was outright disgusted, but told me I HAD to do it nonetheless). So, I did it; I transferred the item knowing well that it ruin tarnish my reputation and show much favortism towards Legacy of Steel, a guild filled not only with excellent players but nice people as well. I knew there would be backlash, which is why when Fell brought up these charges of favortism to me, I defended myself vigorously. And when his little screenshot got back to Brad, all hell broke loose in Verant. I was in hot water for what I said about him, but what were they going to do? Fire me for telling the truth? After that incident, Brad made a formal announcement that GMs are to NEVER transfer no drop items for anyone (they are called no-drop for a reason, afterall). <br>
<br>
I guess something good came out that scandal. Anyway, so that's the story, with my reputation shot, it put me in a position where I had to work harder to make sure other guilds did not feel slighted by this. In the end, many may think that I was Legacy of Steel's GM, not The Nameless'. But I can honestly say that I was an impartial person who took each petition one at a time and believe it or not, I was nothing but fair. Of course, that's my opinion, I could be wrong.  <br>

&quot; Hail Sir.! is it true that monks can solo greens after level 40, since we cant loot/cant tank/cant do anything IN GENERAL? :P&quot; out of frustration..never expecting a response.<br>

I know that there are people that think you were not a good gm, but those are in a very small minority. You brought happiness and joy in roleplaying to a lot of players. The game was changed by you from a dull Evercamp, to something more exciting. You actually cared about players, a quality that very few gm's have/had. You'll be missed greatly as a gm, my friend. <br>
<br>

I enjoyed my time on the Nameless, the players were great and we did have the best GM around, Hideaki made it a server that people wanted to play on, and guide on too<br>
<br>
Thanks for those times Hide, im sure the players miss you<br>

see you soon my friend<br>

I died so many times! lol.  And some other was just recently with some Wizard competition in the ARENA..  But im a old School RPG'r  Back in the Days With My Drow Assassin from AD&amp;D (Gotta love the FIEND FOLIO book!) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>
Anyway from all the stories I have sat here and read about you im very saddened not to have the pleasure of meeting you and playing your quests.. There is alot of potential in this game, I am quite addicted.. and the name EVERCRACK, which i've heard elsewhere, seems to fit QUITE well..  If you still are playing on Nameless Send a /tell to Thundaro (Azreal Skies).  I'd love to play beside you. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>
As for the GM's + Guides now.. I haven't anything BAD to say.. cuz i've YET to see anything of these people. And i have ALOT of hours logged in to this game on this server. Where is all the fun stuff?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>
  I want cool things to do with other people.. AND IM SICK AS HELL OF OASIS! lol.. been hunting there since about lvl 12..  If i make another Croc Steak i think ill puke.. Well Hadeki send a tell if you are around still i'd like to make you my newest friend on Neriak, good luck at your new job, and heres to hoping it is a MMORPG.. AND HOPEFULLY THIS ONE WILL HAVE HORSES!!! heheh  if you've seen me post at other sites like eqanswers or anything you had noticed i am the biggest Advocate to get horses in to this game..&lt;Seinfeld voice&gt; Whats the deal with that?  I want a SOW'd Horse!!! wooooo.. hell on hoofs!  then we can havej ousting competitions or whatever.. horse races and betting!   Oh yeah speaking of betting, where are all the Casinos at?!  maybe they have em in EQ but I just havent found em yet..  But whats an RPG without casinos and gambling?  That has always been one of the best things I liked about RPG's (like Final Fantasy) there was always a casino where you can let it all ride..  damn i miss that. well im done babbling. peace out<br>

There have been a few GM's and Guides I have really liked. You were by far the best. I remember when our server would go down and you would pop into Chat.. Laughing and joking and sending out broadcasts... Pretty much we all thought you were either drunk or just damn happy all the time. It helped alot dealing with the stress of losing time and patience with the server.<br>
<br>
I still remember when you popped up in Lower Guk and Married me (Braeleen Dark`Seer) and Murkyl.. Now that was a riot =)<br>
<br>
Its people like you, Jynxx and a few others that made things alot of fun.<br>
<br>
Nameless won't forget ya, thats for sure. =)<br>

<br>
I never sent tells to you because I thought the second u got a /tell from me it would be bye bye polo =D<br>
<br>
Me being the gay bard I am, I always liked that cute moustache and ur tight butt.  I also truely did feel like someone was out there watching over the server and in a good way.  I remember when santa klaug or whoever came around to us when we where in lguk.  I had heard about ppl getting all sorts of cool stuff, and even though I only got a lousy mistletoe, it was very fun - I think I got to kiss Jynxx so its all good.<br>
<br>
Im very sorry how that whole soul leech thing disrupted the server for awhile and got u into a wierd situation.  <br>
<br>
Ive always wondered something...gawd this is gonna sound egotistical...I never really talked to you or ur guides too much, but did u know who I was at all?  Ive always tried to play polo as best I could and help others when I can but I never really got into the roleplaying part of the game but having a GM who is into it was exciting cause there was always something going on hehe.<br>
<br>
Well enuf of my babbling - have mucho fun in ur new position and know that u are missed )<br>

Vaelie: I clearly remember all the hours I logged in chat with you when the Nameless died those two times. How could I not? People were going apeshit in there. And in those situations you can either be an ass right back to people, but just try to throw random things out there to keep people's attention off the server. So, I threw out random crap like, &quot;I'm going to KFC!&quot; or &quot;Who would win in a fight? Ken or Ryu?&quot; or something like that. I wasn't high, though I was intoxicated a few times when GM-ing on Solusek Ro, but that's another story. Don't do drugs, they are bad!<br>
<br>
Polonious: As one of the first bards in EQ to 50, I did keep tabs on all my high level bards -- you included. You didn't have the commanding personality like Tashoka, but your presence was definitely felt among the small group of elite bards on The Nameless.<br>
