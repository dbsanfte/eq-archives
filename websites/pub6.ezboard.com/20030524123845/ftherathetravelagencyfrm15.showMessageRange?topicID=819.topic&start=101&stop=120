You guys are STILL missing the POINT here.  The point is that CoN mistakingly thought that we had the intention to give them a second chance.  We did not, and we killed Vindi.<br>
<br>
You are all also trying to make this out as if we purposely tried to dick CoN.  Get it through your heads! Nobody PURPOSELY tried to get CoN to rush their pull.<br>
<br>
In the 40 minutes AFTER they wiped we had to clear all the giants all over again, including the temple guards.<br>
<br>
We then pulled Vindi and killed him.  I STILL want to see some logs where CoN was told we were giving thim a second chance.  I don't want to see logs that could elad CoN members to ASSUME that they were getting a second chance, such as them TELLING US stuff.  I want to see someone in our guild say &quot;hey, yeah, you guys go ahead and try again while we clear the temple.&quot;  When I lay eyes on those, I will admit that we caused a huge injustice and shut my pie hole for good here.<br>

First thing I would like to point out, is that it is quite customary for our guild, don’t know about other guilds, to know who else is in the zone at all times.  So after Kenshiiro /ooc’d that he was pulling, is it possible that he still did not know that CoN intended to go after Vindi, and that he was just saying CoN because they were the only guild in the same area as Vindi?  Yes by the logs, at least 1 member knew of CoN’s intentions, but doesn’t it stand to chance that MABEY that one person failed to inform the guild leader, officers, raid leaders, general public, of that knowledge?  Yes if he did that was bad on that person, but not on Kenshiiro or the rest of the Guild.  <br>
<br>
<br>
One more thing, if you look at this log posted BY CoN members, 3 minutes after Kenshiiro Asked what CoN’s intentions were “CoN?” Sekhar says that he has to pull vindi asap.  Explain to me where you say that SoY did not back down?  You never gave them a chance to back down. 8 minutes later Sekhar pokes Vindi (with a spork even god that’s gotta hurt) and pulls him and, from what I can tell from all the other posts here,  his guards and one repop.  7 minutes later (I guess this is while you are fighting? Or mabey hes still pulling?) Kenshiiro is still trying to figure out whats going on.. I repeat you never gave them the chance to back down.  <br>
<br>
SoY is a very good natured guild from my viewpoint.  The ONE ToV raid I’ve been on we ended up having to kill one of the nameds, because it was in the way of the pull.. And the piece that dropped was kept by the officers (specifically Loot Council) in order to be Multi Quested with the guild that was on the Doz Rotation coming up.<br>
<br>
I was a member of SoT from its beginings till about 3 months after the merger with Guardians of Anatonica (I think that was the name of the guild, it’s the one Thunderon and Nycah were in.. theyd know it for sure if I’m wrong).  And have been a member of SoY for approx. 6 or 7 months.  I value my reputation and the reputation of those I’m surrounded by (because we all know you are known by the company you keep) and I just have to admit that AT THE MOMENT, I couldn’t pick a better guild to be in.  99.9% of all the members are extremely nice, and most bend over backwards for their fellow Norrathians, guild or no guild.  <br>
<br>
Ok I Think I’m done now.. please feel free to flame me for stating facts and asking questions, I’m sure you will anway.<br>

According to their own logs, Raitlin was the only SoY in kael at the time.  We had no idea CoN was after Vindi.  We start &quot;forming our masses&quot; and yell a couple more camp checks AFTER our officers are in the zone (4 min after raitlins first), as well as the rest of the guild, and we get &quot;arena&quot; from CoN.  We get no vindi.  Plz, if you have something camped, plz say what is being camped and not the vicinity.  I am aware you called it earlier, but we had one person in zone.  For all you know Raitlin coulda been by himself looking for faction and the rest of us, unaware to him, were coming for Vindi.  Raitlin coulda had guildchat off, too.  Clearly, we were UNAWARE of CoN's attempt until Kenshiiro /ooc'ed that we were pulling.  Had they answered our latest camp checks an hour earlier with &quot;vindi&quot; and not arena, we would have left to kill something else.  Yes, they answered it when &quot;one&quot; person was there, but as I said: he coulda been independant with guildchat off.  They refused to say Vindi when the rest of us appeared.<br>
<br>
And the fact that we &quot;rushed&quot; them??  Why didnt' a CoN officer send a tell IMMEDIATELY upon hearing we were going to pull vindi to get things straightened out instead of &quot;oh shit, we're going to get KSed, lets suicide in and bring vindi with his guards.&quot;  Also, Logs state that CoN &quot;says&quot; they spoke with our leader about this.  Falden Says that Seanus Talked with our leader.  Our leader is Kenshiiro.  Kenshiiro received &quot;no&quot; tell.  Our officers are clueless, as well.  So, who contacted who????  Who did Seanus talk with?  Wasn't us.  <br>
<br>
I'm saddened to see SoY getting a bad name for being misunderstood in an incident that should have easily been corrected.  1)  Answer our camp checks when more than one person from SoY is in Kael. 2)  Answer all our camp checks with the same answer plz.  3)  Send a tell to straighten out incidents where two guilds are going after the same mob.  SoY didn't have a chance to senda tell.  You pulled immediately.  4)  Don't blame every member of SoY for the actions of a few.  5)  Don't blame any member of SoY for a misunderstanding of this magnitude because of failed communication.<br>
<br>
One thing I hate in some people is closemindedness.  People who see things their way or no way.  Open your brain up and realize that SoY doesn't just walk into a zone, KS a mob, and leave.  I'm sorry that this *one* misunderstood incident makes you believe it's our priority and our actions.  We are a very respectable guild whatever you choose to believe or not.  If you refuse to see our side of the story, you don't deserve to have anyone listen to you either and your comment means shit to me.  There are a few here who have respectfully looked at both sides, read both logs, then made their opinions for both sides of the argument.  Those opinions are the ones I truly value whether defending SoY or flaming.<br>
<br>
SoY is a respectable guild.  I know many times we have turned down ToV (HoT) for other guilds to farm when we've had it scheduled for a week or two on our boards.  We've turned it down when we were in force before other guilds were as well. I ask that you do not let one incident of a misunderstanding this outrageous to affect the reputation of SoY and it's members. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->61st Beastlord<br>

Since this is a reply to my post by Loria, I would like to explain to you how i got that opinion. What you are referring to is seconds not minutes. The far right field in the time stamp records seconds, so format would be DAY hh:mm:ss. Therefore that would be 8 seconds later Sekhar gives the inc message stating that he is about to aggro vindi and 7 seconds till Kenshiiro stated asking about the camp check. I formed my opinion on the fact that Sekhar aggroed vindi 25 secs after  Kenshiiro says out of character, 'we are Pulling Vindi through Right arena ina few secs...just watch out' ( which was only approx 40 secs after Kenshiiro stated in /ooc CoN? and then followed with the /ooc lol a few secs before. With such a short time ( only a few seconds ) from him /ooc lol and then stating that SoY was going to pull and CoN pulling almost immediately after he stated that i formed an opinion that they where rushed. <br>
<br>
I will repeat again that I believe this was a misunderstanding. Just didnt want you misinterepting what i posted.<br>

[Mon Nov 04 21:09:18 2002] There is 1 player in EverQuest.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The above /who listing is a listing on the characters name, and not the SoY within Kael at that time.  So while he could have been the only SoY in the zone, there also could have been several others (the logs do not indicate either).<br>
<br>
How do I know this a listing of the character name, and not the SoY in the zone?<br>
1.  &quot;ZONE: kael &quot;  This is only present in a /who listing when the &quot;All&quot; flag is added.  When you do a /who for the zone you are currently in, it does not list the zone next to the person's name.<br>
2.  &quot;There is 1 player in EverQuest.&quot;  Same as above, if this were a /who listing for Kael then it would state &quot;There is 1 player in Kael Drakel.&quot;<br>
<br>
That being said, more than likely this was all just a miscommunication... up till the point where SoY pulled Vindi after CoN wiped out.  You say you were not pressuring them, ok sure.  But then your actions later speak against you when you do pull Vindi while CoN is still there preping for thier next attempt. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 10:30:15 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> OKay Milambus...<br>
<br>
So even though it was obvious that we were about to pull Vindi...<br>
<br>
And even though they didn't ASK us if we would wait for them to try again....<br>
<br>
We SHOULD have just sat there and let them.<br>
<br>
I personally would have probably asked them myself what they were going to do...but whatever, it wasn't my call.  Hell, I wasn't even there.<br>
<br>
We were not 100% as courteous as it would have been possible to be, but we didn't beat them over the head with a frying pan either.<br>
<br>
Like it was posted above, there should have been communication (meaning both parties talking to EACH OTHER)about the second attempt.  There wasn't.  We pulled.<br>

<br>
 Maliah -  It's sort of a silly name for the guy who looks into disputes concerning any member of Yamabushi. I try to smooth things over when our members have disputes with eachother or with players not of our guild. Typically you speak with both sides of a dispute, try your best to ascertain the truth and resolve it such that each participant in the dispute is satisfied. More often than not I encounter simple misunderstandings. Sometimes someone has done something downright wrong. When that someone is a guild member that someone is dealt with quickly and harshly.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Concerning the Statue rotation...<br>
<br>
The &quot;invite&quot; that attended our first Statue attempt was not the designated tank. He wasn't even a back up tank. Things went poorly at first (we lost our primary and secondary tanks VERY quickly, heh it happens) and he had the quick reflexes to jump in and basically save the day. I was proud of the job we did in recovering from a poorly executed initial engagement. I believe about a week later he was a guilded member. We took statue again last night, with little effort and ABSOLUTELY NO invites as prescribed by the terms agreed upon. The insinuation that we &quot;duped&quot; the Rathe into believing we did the Statue alone that came along with the Rathe's actions of removing us and returning us to the rotation with &quot;conditional qualifiers&quot; was unnecessary.<br>
<br>
 No-one here has any evidence proving or disproving whether this incident was a simple misunderstanding or an evil act of the scourge of the Rathe known as Yamabushi <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Everyone has basically used what evidence we have (logs) and interpreted them to fit their already formed opinion. Tell me, what is easier to believe? That Yamabushi got a little overzealous in their attempt to defeat thier next intended target or that we zoned in, saw CoN and knew of their intentions and then &quot;raced&quot; (umm, btw, if we were racing we would have taken FAR less time than the logs indicate) CoN to Vindi and in an evil and clever maneuver &quot;tricked&quot; CoN into pulling early thereby wiping and leaving us with the prize for which we &quot;stole&quot; (40 minutes later mind you) under their noses?<br>
<br>
 OMG, now that I've said it, even I am laughing my ass off. Guys, you are better than this. Use your intelligence to determine what is more likely and remove your unwarranted pre-conceptions BEFORE you do so.<br>

A few comments posted are just screaming out to me for rebuttal. The people that posted the majority of these comments seem to not have read the whole post thread and have just skimmed over it, finding information that supports there opinion. <br>
<br>
Cyrus posts:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> According to the logs, when Raitlin asked for a camp check, CoN pronounced vindi. According to their own logs, Raitlin was the only SoY in kael at the time. We had no idea CoN was after Vindi. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That is not what their logs display. Their logs displayed the fact that they did a /who all Raitlin. As pointed out by Milambus, you can verify this by looking at the ZONE: keal entry behind his name. This log entry did not prove that he was the only one there, it proves that he was in the zone at the time. Although if you would of read the posted logs in the beginning of this thread throughly you would have noticed in the logs that an actual /who was done in zone and verified that raitlin was the only SoY in zone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> We start &quot;forming our masses&quot; and yell a couple more camp checks AFTER our officers are in the zone (4 min after raitlins first), as well as the rest of the guild, and we get &quot;arena&quot; from CoN. We get no vindi.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The logs show that it was only four minutes after Raitlin called camp check and specifically asked who had Vindi. Short amount of time I might add for a ( very interesting class I may add, that is usually deployed to check if mobs are up before the main body of a raid gets there) 55 Outrider A.K.A Ranger to be asking specifically about vindi and not inform his guild that it was up and taken. Who by the way was already enbroute to kael because they zoned in 4 mins after. Logs below<br>

<br>
2.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another point on this is that Raitlin was also in the zone at the time of the raid. It is very interesting to me that a 55 ranger who is in the same zone as his/her guild, while they are raiding Vindi, who decline to join his guild in the raid in favor of faction ( which you build ToV faction on vindi raids anyways, unless he was looking for Thurg faction ). Just FYI, I fully believe he was part of the raiding force. Logs from a /who done by CoN. For the sake of saving webspace I removed all non SoY out of the log<br>

<br>
That is how I came to the conclusion that CoN felt rushed.<br>
<br>
Now, if SoY¡¯s defense I will stay that I believe the logs posted by CoN did not display every single event that happened. That the person who posted the logs edited out information that may have been relevent and not letting us form a 100% sure opinion of what happened. Then again the unedited logs may have information that would make SoY¡¯s version of what happened¡¦well you finish the sentence..<br>
<br>
There is probably more I can clarify, but frankly I am too tired to write more. I will again state that I believe this whole event was a miscomunication and hat the guilds involved did not set out to interfere with one another. Just please, in the future, try to read the post thoughly before discounting what I presented to you.<br>

The SOLE reason I even posted on this was because I felt that SOY’s actions were a breach of The Rathe etiquette. I have never seen such callous disregard for 35 other players.  As someone pointed out earlier, CON the other day, your guild the next.  People have to accept responsibility for their and their guidmates actions.  So far all I’ve heard is<br>
<br>
1. SOY didn’t know you were pulling Vindi <br>
2. SOY didn’t rush CON <br>
3. SOY did a CR for you, be grateful CON.<br>
3. Well SOY as long as we are here, and massed up solely for the purpose of saving CON lets go after Vindi . . . watch out as you step over the corpses of CON, I don't want any of you to stub your toes.<br>
        (ed. - this is my personal favorite)<br>
<br>
The readers can decide what version they want to believe.<br>
<br>
Myself, gee, I was in Kael for three hours that night and all I learned was that some folks just don’t care if they ruin your night as long as they get what they want.  I just didn't realize that was ANY guilds philosophy.<br>
<br>
Once again, enjoy your loot, we’ll see how much it will cost your uber guild in the long run. <br>

<br>
Well it pretty much seems to me that you had already chosen your side when you came to these boards, and nothing anyone said could dessuade you.<br>
<br>
CoN was always held in the highest respect by me, since I was about level 30 and one of my closest friends moved to them.  They are still held to that respect.<br>
<br>
SoY, as everyone has said, pulls underhanded shit yada yada, I have raided with them, done things with them, watched them grow since my brother joined them when he was 30ish, and I just fail to see what everyone else sees I guess.<br>
<br>
I am not choosing sides in this arguement, as even with logs, there are still things that are missing.<br>
<br>
I chose sides earlier in the arguement and that was wrong and a jump to conclusions, so I will just leave it as a misunderstanding since I have seen no proof otherwise.<br>

<br>
Everyone is still arguing over whether a camp check was called.<br>
<br>
The point still is that there was 2 interested parties in Vindi.  <br>
<br>
The first one failed.<br>
<br>
The second one never agreed to let them try again.<br>
<br>
The second one succeeded.<br>
<br>
End of Story.<br>
<br>
You can continue to make up anything you want about how we tried to pressure them, blah blah blah, but the point is we did nothing of the sort. <br>
<br>
When Kenshiiro realized CoN's intent to pull Vindi, he backed down.  They would have had the time they needed to pull, but the elected to pull before they were ready.  That was their downfall.<br>
<br>
Was one of our members irresponsible in his relaying of CoN's intent?  Perhaps, I have no idea.  But the point is still that we killed him AFTER an attempt by CoN, and never agreed to them having a second attempt.<br>
<br>
I'm still waiting for the logs that disprove this before I stop saying this over and over and over again.  Everyone keeps repeating themselves, so here I am doing it too.<br>
