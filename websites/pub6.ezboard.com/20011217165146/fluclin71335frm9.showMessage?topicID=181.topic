<br>
This is only from what I know, and most likely there's better ways and some of what I say may contain incomplete information. I'll add to this as I go, so that maybe others won't make the same mistakes that I've made.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Creating your nano-technician</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 - Nothing in the character creation process will really effect your char in it's lifetime. It's all cosmetic stuff like body size, race, facial appearance, and your name. So choose what you want!!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Starting out in the newbie grounds at level 1</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
:::::Getting you ready for battle:::::<br>
1. - Check your inventory. To do this you can simply hit the 'i' key on your keyboard, just like in EQ. You should have 2 nano programs, a pistol, some startup treatment kits, some startup first aid kits, and maybe a map or 2.<br>
2. - First we want to arm you with your pistol. Look to the top right of your screen and you'll see some buttons. Hover your mouse over the first one, text should come up that says 'wear'. If it doesn't, keep going along until you find one that does. Click it, and you'll bring up the window for your worn inventory. Hit the 'i' key on your keyboard if your inventory window isn't open and drag your pistol into a hand slot. You've just armed yourself with a pistol. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
3. - Now to use the nano programs that you've been given. &lt;incomplete info, need to figure out how I uploaded them again&gt; Info incomplete or not, I *think* if you drag them into the long window in the upper left of your screen that has a '1' on it that can be scrolled and right click on them, they'll upload and their icon will change. The ice one you have is an ice dd, that will do around 14 damage to things on average. The other one, malaise of movent is the same as a 'root' spell in EQ. *If* you find that you get a message that some skill is too low for you to use your nano programs, click on the 'SKL' button on the bottom of your screen and find that skill and raise it to the level you need. While you're at it, max out your stamina, body dev, nano pool, pistol, nano init, ranged init, nano resist, run speed, treatment, and anything else that looks like you might need it. Remember, you're like a wizard in EQ, don't go maxing something stupid out that you're NOT going to use yet.<br>
4. - Lastly, before you start battle, drag your treatment kits from you inventory into the window that has your nano programs in it, and do the same with your med kits (or whatever they're called). Treatments kits you can only use while sitting. To use them hit the 'F1' key on your keyboard to target yourself (like in EQ) and right click the treatment kit... you'll be healed for about 15hp and you'll regain about 15 in your nanopool. The other ones (med kits they're called, I *think*) can be used during battle, and they only heal hp's and not nanopool. You can buy more of these right in the newbie area but they're expensive.<br>
5. - Last, but not least, go to the top right on your screen and click on the button that looks like a bar graph (when you hover your pointer on it, it should say something like 'stats'). In the window that pops up you should see your health, nanopool, and exp. Below that you'll see a bar that has 'DEF' on one side and 'AGG' on the otherside. Move the slider on this bar all the way to the 'AGG' side. This will make you attack faster and more on the aggressive side. Starting out you do NOT want to be on the defensive side, or you won't do much damage and will die quickly.<br>
:::::Going into battle:::::<br>
1. - When going into battle, it's the same deal as EQ pretty much. Click on something, and you'll see it's targetted on the top of your screen... the colors for it's level compared to yours are roughly the same as EQ. You can also cycle through targets nearby with the 'tab' key. The 'q' key on your keyboard is your auto attack key, and once you have something targeted and hit it, you'll being firing your pistol at it. You can cast your nano programs on it (use the ice one, forget the root for now) by right clicking on them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Levels 1-3</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 - Kill all of the leets, reets of paradise, and vampiris(sp?) lizards that you can. Be sure to move away from the guards a bit, or they'll ks you like crazy. If you get into trouble or start lagging, immediately run to the guards. No need to die... Use your startup treatment kits as needed. Save your money for more treatment kits, medical kits, and nano rechargers.<br>
 - If you die, you'll go back to your starting area. Sit and rest until you get a message that says something to the effect of &quot;You remains have been made available for retreival&quot; and go to the nearest reclaim booth and get your things back. Sell all jewels and monster parts for cash.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Levels 3-6</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 - do missions like crazy... start off with the easiest. Be careful, once in the mission, depending on the objective, you'll most likely be faced with a personal dungeon full of daft punks and things that are a bit harder than leets. You'll have to pull them to the mission zone room door and kill them one at a time. If you get overwhelmed, don't be a hero, zone out, rest, and try again. Look for chests on the ground, they can have nice things in them to help you out, and be sure to loot all corpses.<br>

Took me a long time to figure all that out on my soldier, but let me tell you that little Hp buff he has is very very nice.  I really dig how every class has their own spells, makes everyone a hybrid variation.  I know I can't wait for the damage reflection nanos for a soldier, that will make soloing very nice.<br>
