AND WHY DON&quot;T THEY JOIN UP FOR FEAR RAID.<br>first off all last nite i received a email saying if i can make plz come no clerics have signed up for fear and i thought oh boy here we go again the lone cleric but THANK GOD VAARD AND CHERRYBLOSSEM CAME AND HELP. But i want too know  why the hell is there not many clerics there the COG needs CLERICS in fear like we need DRUIDS AND CASTERS in hate <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  what is up with this are people that selfish that they can't help there brothers and sisters get some plains armor it really makes me sick for my point off veiw I have 2 real good Pally friends which i have hunted for a very long time join us on these fear raids too get some off there armor and I love too see people happy when they get there plains armour like i was when i got my gauntlets  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  my 2 friends were very happy too finally get a peice off there armor. the one pally friend it was her first time up there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have been too alot off fear runs in the last 2 weeks  and i will keep going up. Helping people too get there armor like i would like too see them in the plains off hate helping others get there armor. I really hope this changes in teh near furture then thing will start looking and going better for us.<br><br>Concern 2 WHY CAN&quot;T SOME PEOPLE LISTEN TOO DIRECTIONS  <br> okie at the beginging off the raid we were told who the main tanks where and too make a hot key too assist them when they say too attack and also when we zone TO STAND AND DIE IF THAT PERSON GETS ATTACKED DO NOT TRAIN TOO CAMP!! and too go left when u zone why were people going right is behond me. but anyways we started out good i tought had 2 mobs down working on the 3 then some one brings a train in and kills us all =(  IS IT REALLY THAT HARD TO SACRAFICE URSELF THEN IT IS TOO KILL THE HOLE RAIDING PARTY. So we all reformed and got ready too go in again we get in alright start looting some items too get rdy too fight if something comes too camp once again some one goes right and trains the camp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  people die again And my biggest concern was the chanters mezzed the mobs how did the mezzes get broken if everybody hit the assist button people was getting the hang off it late that nite but it was a little too late tok us about 6hr or more too break a camp. The thing is people were told too stay in camp went out off camp too get bodies why did they do that is beyond me i wrote some names down off the people i seen going out off camp too get bodies. i think for next time no sow is too be casted for west camp and some one stop half way too see if they are going too get attacked.<br><br>3rd concern i had was with the rezzing people we had alot off bodies too rez this nite and the thing was i was refused when i went too rez a guy because that person was waiting for the higher lvl cleric rez. That really pissed me off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and thing is thats not the first time either. Well these are the plains the cleric have a big job off rezzing people and when there is alot and bodies have almost been there for 3 hours is losing 10%xp better then finding out ur body has become too old. You can get xp back at a later day in teh plains we have no time for people too pick and chose who they want too rez them. if that was the case the higher lvl cleric would've been there for a very long time rezzing people.<br>I know some peoples bodies were too old =( i know i had 3 off them become too old for me too rez but big deal i was more worried about other people then mine. I even had a guy tell me too go rez another guy for he didn't care if one off his bodies became too old he had the one thats good enough I comend him for doing that u know who u are i forgot too write it down sorry but his class was a druid. If people start becoming that picky on what lvl rez they get i will start refusing too rez a few people too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but that i do not want too do so on raid try too take what u can get.<br><br>But that is all i have too say on this for now in my mind i think west camp is still way better place too go if done right we could be hunting for armor by 1h 1/2 to 2 hrs even less and I would like too run a fear raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  if people would like too see it done give me a tell i will get something going  of course i will need help and people too join me on the raid like. &lt;cough more clerics cough&gt;<br><br>this is my opinion and prob alot off others too we start working together more and raid breaks will get better each time and faster too so plz more clerics too fear and more druids and casters too hate or else i will sugest haemish put a point system in for the best peice off armor the chest item goes too the person that has the most points u get a point each time u got too another persons plains example damen (lvl50 cleric) been too the fear plains 6times will get the chest item if it drops in hate if there is a tie then those people with the same amount off points roll for it. all other item will not be on point system which i think is a real good idea give me a veiw on this too plz<br><br>thanks alot if u took the time too read this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br> VERIUS Stormweaver (51st season vicar) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uflarrenlagdalen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flarren Lagdalen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/14/01 9:32:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: agreed, peeps open your ears</span><hr size=1> could be hard to keep track of sometimes but the point system might be good.

You can see the corpse, how hard could it be? At times I would be at the camp looking at the portal and would see people running for all around the hill to the camp.

I found the patience level to be high, everyone sit quieting and waited for their orders and so on. (They didn't follow them but they where quiet when the should have been listening) <br><br>I come because I love being part of something big, I want to see people happy and having fun. I support my friends even if I have nothing to gain and only things to loss. I don't care about the loot, I don't care about the Exp. But I do care about my Friends.

It is not meant as a recrimination, nor as finger pointing, but as a tool to learn how to do better. <br><br>We succeeded in breaking the west wall camp in Fear. <br><br>Ok stop, repeat that sentence to yourself 5 times before reading on. Say it like a mantra, over and over again. <br><br>We succeeded in breaking the west wall camp in Fear. <br><br>I want you to repeat this, and keep it in mind as you read the rest of this post and all others on this subject. Keep in mind that the west wall camp is considered to be one of the hardest level 46-55 encounters in the game. The Sacred Band-led CoG did this camp, without calling in an uber guild to help us. All those who participated should be proud as hell of that achievement. When you read the negatives in this post, keep that positive in mind, because in the end, what we did is important. It is a positive point, and it shows that with tenacity, discipline and courage, we can do amazing things on Council raids. <br><br>And now, as you keep that positive in mind, here's the negative. <br><br>How we did this raid was not good. We took 7 hours to break this place. If done correctly, the west wall camp can be broken in as little as 30 minutes. While I don't pretend that we could do it that quickly (because of the sheer number of different guilds involved), we can do it better. <br><br>Now the root of many of the problems on this raid is me. As a level 40 player, I cannot go into the planes, no matter how much I might desire to. My original intention has been to organize the raid (schedule it, deal with sign ups, appoint management positions, etc.) and then turn it over to my appointed raid commander. However, the one I'd appointed was unable to show (for connectivity problems I later found out). I failed to appoint a raid commander at that point, and as a result people didn't know who to follow, many instructions were left out, and miscommunication among the management body ensued all night. This armchair generaling hurt us up until I left.<br><br>We rushed into the plane, hardly before I'd gotten the groups set. Before I knew it, Zellex had gone into the plane and begun kiting, and I for one was not ready. But I didn't hold us up, and I should have. I didn't have an accurate picture of the strategy Zellex was using to kite/pull/break the camp, so was unable to give folks an idea of how to do their thing. It was only on the 3rd run in that I was clear on how it was being done. This should have been set up and explained beforehand, twice if necessary. That won't happen in the future. <br><br>When Zellex suggested the West wall camp, I should have said no, but I deferred to his judgement on this one. Looking at the number of people we had at the start (about 30), I felt that we should not try to break in that way, but didn't say so, and didn't change the camp to the north wall. Had I nominated a battle commander, they would have probably told me to do a north wall camp as well, but I didn't. <br><br>For all of these things I'm sorry. These led to a lot of the problems that came later on. A successful raid starts with a successful management body, and we weren't, and much of the blame for that must fall on me. For those who fought and died and lost experience on this raid, I apologize. <br><br>Now for the things that I had no control over. <br><br>Evac should have been called by a raid commander, which in the end would be Cassia for this one. No one should evac unless the raid commander shouts &quot;EVAC!&quot; To do so causes others to be killed needlessly. Had I let everyone know to follow Cassia's word on this and no one else's, this might not have happened. But I feel I must stress it again. ONLY the raid commander can call evac, no one else. If the raid leader doesn't call it, you don't do it. I know at one point, some folks evaced out thinking that if there were over 4 mobs you should evac. If no one shouted a definite evac, don't do it. <br><br>Ressurections are NEVER to be refused on ANY Sacred Band-led CoG raid. If ANYONE ever refuses a ressurection because they want to wait on a higher level res, they will not be ressed, and can come and loot their corpse whenever they feel the need. I'll explain why. <br><br>48 people were on this raid. At one point, 30 or so were in the plane trying to break the camp, and about half of them died. So let's say 15 people need resses, and there's only one cleric with his gear and ready to res, a level 52 cleric like Verius. Vaard, a level 57 cleric hasn't been ressed yet. The first person to be ressed doesn't want to be ressed by Verius, he's wants the higher level res that Vaard can do. But Vaard isn't in the planes, but his corpse is. Which means Vaard has to be ressed with the 52nd level res, a 90% res. Now that person who refused the first res, gets Vaard's res, a 97% res. Is it fair that Vaard HAD to take the 90% res just so you could get another 7% exp. back? Is it fair to the other 13 people who need to be ressed in 3 hours or less, who just had to wait an extra 5-10 minutes so you could get your extra 7% res back? <br><br>If your answer to that question is yes, don't come on any SB-led CoG raids again. NO ONE's experience, including mine, or anyone else's is more important than ANYONE else's. You do not have the right to make a raid wait for your 7% of experience. It is rude and insulting and inconsiderate. We had this happen on our last Nagafen raid, and it added an hour to the raid at the end. People complain about these raids taking time, well, that's one reason. In future, we will res you as soon as we can, and the first res you get is the one you take or you don't get another chance. That may sound harsh or rude, but how would you feel if you COULDN'T be ressed because someone took up 2 or 3 minutes of the cleric's time refusing his res? <br><br>Listening to directions HAS to be done. We had a lot of miscommunication in the management body, which carried down to the raiders. BUT, I know I said MANY times after the first groups went in, do NOT turn right at the portal, and still people did. On future raids, our management body will have better communication. Make sure your listening is up to the task. <br><br>Assist, assist, assist! We had major problems with either assist not working, or it being ignored. If you are a melee class and assist isn't working AND there are enchanters there and you aren't sure which mob to hit, you'd better not be hitting any of them. Main assist must make sure that you are targeted and attacking, and you MUST shout out what you are hitting. By the time you hit 46, you should have that lesson driven home many times. <br><br>When in the west camp, STAY in the west camp. Your corpse will be dragged to you, you don't have to go and get it. <br><br>If you haven't been given an explicit title like main assist, raid commander, or loot coordinator, don't use the out of character channels. Don't assume you've been given responsibilities unless the RAID COMMANDER has told you so. I apologize again for not specifiying a raid commander. <br><br>I know that at one point, there were some who refused to zone in with their group when told to, because they didn't want to lose anymore exp. Get over it. Just like the ressing issue above, you're experience isn't worth anymore than the people in your group who DID zone in and are putting their butts on the line. If your group leader or the raid commander says zone, by the gods you do it. Refusal to do so can and will get your thrown off the raid, especially if accompanied by a comment like &quot;I don't want to lose anymore exp.&quot;<br><br>Noticed I haven't attached names to any of this. Pointing out people who train the camp, or who refuse reses only serves to piss people off. The people who screwed up KNOW that they srewed up, and this post is not meant to highlight them and make them feel bad. It's meant to be used by us as a learning tool. We've had a very difficult break in. Learn from it, because it was bound to happen sooner or later. Blaming people and name-calling isn't going to make future raids a success, learning from them will. <br><br>For my own sanity, I'm not going to attempt to be a battle commander on SB-led CoG planes raids until I reach level 47. It isn't fair to the raiders, and it isn't fair to myself. I will organize them, possibly making groups if asked. <br><br>What I would like to see is other alliances/people LIKE the Sacred Band step up and lead CoG Planes raids. I would be perfectly happy if one week Zellex led a plane raid, the next week, the Sacred Band led one, then the 3rd week someone from say Haven of Light or Fellowship of Faydark led a raid, then the 4th week, someone from another alliance or guild run one. Even if you're guild is not doing planes on a regular basis, I'd like to see those smaller guilds with just a few planes ready people step up and lead. Because one day, the Sacred Band will have enough folks that we'll have to do them without the CoG, just to be fair to the people in the alliance. I'd like to have someone to take our place when that does happen.

You MUST be bound close by to the Fear raid. Even if this means you have to run there, get bound, then run to the Feerott (or whatever staging area) the night before the raid, DO IT. We had WAY to many people who were bound on other continents, casters included. This expanded our refresh time greatly. Binding in Freeport or the Lake Rathe Arena (or Grobb if you can manage it) prior to the raid greatly reduces the downtime, especially on a west camp break in that might entail zoning back in naked with a sword. Casters not binding outside the portal also happened, and just shouldn't. Having to send out druids to reconstitute groups made for a nightmare. <br><br>2) Latecomers and no shows. I had a list of about 30 or so people who signed up for the raid. Of that number, about HALF didn't show up at all, or were 2 or more hours late. If you sign up, either make it or post that you were unable to make it. I know there were some connectivity issues with some folks that night, but post or email the person organizing it beforehand. If you know you'll be late past the cutoff time, post or email the organizer about that so they'll know what to expect. Since we were so short on folks, I allowed late comers all night, 2 full groups worth. This did however create confusion, as they weren't here to hear what mission briefing we had. You need to be on time because it takes time to take attendance, organize groups and brief them on what they are to do. If you come in late, causing regrouping issues, the 1 minute you were late is 1 minute more we're outside the plane, not raiding and having fun. If you're late for RL reasons, that's understandable. If you're late because you have to run from Fironia Vie and didn't do it the previous night or arrange transportation in advance, that's rude not only to the raid organizer and his management body, but to everyone on the raid. <br><br>Haemish <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvaardlifeshield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaard Lifeshield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/16/01 12:20:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR RAID CONCERNS I HAVE</span><hr size=1> i have been on raids with uber guilds and it has taken up to 9 hours to break west camp, alot of times its a matter of luck. <br><br>As for Rezzes... not to seem harsh or anything, but i have ALOT of rezzes to do after breakin like this.

I have always been am opponent of the point system, and from what the systems I have seen, I have yet to see anything that would convince me that a point system is overall better than the random system.  It's an administrative nightmare, it makes the big assumption that people who have gone to more raids deserve items more than anyone else, it makes people who just reached level 46/47 and are new to the planes feel less appreciated than others (especially if they turn out to be more contributive than someone in their 50s), and (my personal favourite) it puts undue focus on items which in turn often results in single-mindedness (&quot;I am here because of an item, and I deserve it!&quot;), getting-something-out-of-it attitudes, and most of all, even more arguments about what should be included in this point system and what not.  <br><br>Now, ignoring my opinion ... I would like to hear from clerics (and I mean clerics who don't come regularly, i.e., not Vaard/Verius) if they would actually go to fear if such a point system was established.  I know for a fact that even with the system, clerics often don't go to fear after they've gotten specific items in hate, so it may only buy us a little time, nothing more.<br><br>Are there any other methods that would deal with all the above disadvantages? I know it has been mentioned before, why not pay clerics who come to a fear raid? Invite clerics to management?  <br><br>p.s.

I think it would make people who have never been to a plane raid feel that they aren't appreciated as much as others, and would put the emphasis on items. <br><br>Frankly, I don't know what to do about the clerics in Fear. We managed to get 3 through some begging and arm twisting, but we had the same problem/number of clerics on the dragon raids (both Vox and Nagafen). I also think that the administration would be even more of a nightmare than anyone thinks. Since we aren't an alliance (as the CoG I mean), we don't have a consistent set of managers or of attendees. Zellex runs his raids one week, and the Sacred Band run ours the next week. Adding FoF to that mix for a third week will then mean that 3 different management bodies will keep track of attendance. Then consider that you don't have to be guilded to go on a CoG Planes raid. Just this past Tuesday, fully half of the crew that came had not attended a raid I'd run before. <br><br>And for those people who just can't make the days that we set Fear raids, but can make Hate raids, what about those people? I know the intention of the point system is good, and it's not a bad system for that. I just disagree with the concepts of the points system in general. In the discussion that the Sacred Band members had about Loot Rules, such a system was brought up and almost all who discussed it felt it was a bad idea. <br><br>Haemish <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uplangstrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>P Langstrump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/16/01 9:24:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interlog.com/~wings/jane/a_lindgren/lindgren_pics/pippi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR RAID CONCERNS I HAVE</span><hr size=1> Maybe the solution is to do some aggressive cleric-recruiting within the guilds that are willing to lead CoG raids.

If he fought and bled 57 times, and a random pally shows up to his 1 and only fear raid he ever plans on attending and wins a pally item, that isn't at all fair to the blood the older pally has shed not just in the name of the CoG, but in the name of EVERYONE else who has EVER won anything on a CoG raid that pally attended. Does he deserve it more than other people? Maybe. Does he deserve it more than the new pally? Yes, yes he does. And any of you who have won a roll on your own item while the older pally was there should be cheering for him to win something as well; anything else is not only unjust, it's selfish.<br><br><br>&gt;it makes people who just reached level 46/47 and are new<br>&gt;to the planes feel less appreciated than others <br><br>I completely disagree with you here. Last night was my first fear raid, and I was 46. Did I win a lotto on the only druid drop? No, I lost to someone with a significant bonus advantage. But I didn't go to the raid for lewt (though that would be a nice fringe-benefit if it had happened). I went to meet some new people, to see a new zone, and to learn how to raid as high-level should. I didn't walk away with a planes drop. I walked away with the knowledge you cannot gain from reading about a planes raid, but only from first-hand experience. I walked away from the success and pride of breaking west camp in a little over an hour, and having precious few deaths after this was done. No, I didn't do nearly as much damage as some of the higher level people, but I was welcomed as an EQUAL by everyone on that raid.<br><br><br>&gt;and (my personal favourite) it puts undue focus on items<br>&gt;which in turn often results in single-mindedness (&quot;I am<br>&gt;here because of an item, and I deserve it!&quot;)<br><br>Again I think you are taking the extreme here. You don't get a job because you don't want pay. You don't go to school because you don't want a degree. Everything you do, you do to further yourself, to gain something. Perhaps you do something to further someone else? You are still aiding your own causes by improving your &quot;standing&quot; (faction if you will) with that person. Don't misconstrue this is greed, as many seem to do.<br><br><br>That being said, I am obviously a proponent of a bonus system.

If I give up something for someone one day, the universe will return the favor another day. So I run or organize raids that I might lose exp. on and not gain an item from in the hopes that other might run a raid that I will gain exp. on or an item from. Same reason I run events like the Valentine's Day dance, I run an event that is fun for others, in the hopes someone else will run an event that I can just participate in. Doesn't always work, and may take a long time to bear fruit (i.e. I could be that paladin on his 57th raid). I won't pretend that when I lead or go on a raid I don't want to get an item (Naggie has a cloak of flames with my name on it, I swear). I'd love to get something. However, the excitement of that particular raid is why I go, and the ego boost of knowing that I put X number of people to a goal, set a strategy and it works. <br><br>The concept of time of service being rewarded is an interesting one, and one I'm ambivalent about. In a guild where the players are mostly a consistent group, it would work a whole lot better, however, in an loose conglomeration like the CoG, I think there tends to be so little continuity to the whole thing that the administration is the biggest hurdle. Also, with planes and dragon type raids, the rather fluid nature of their timing (could be one day this week, then another day next week), makes continuity of raiding parties almost nonexistent. Half the people at this past Fear raid were new to me and new to the planes. There were maybe 10-15 people who had been on the previous Sacred Band plane of fear raid. After one month, the list of one time attendees could be immense. I'm just not sure that a points system would achieve the proper purpose, i.e. to get more clerics on the raid. <br><br>Haemish <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uplangstrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>P Langstrump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/16/01 12:37:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interlog.com/~wings/jane/a_lindgren/lindgren_pics/pippi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR RAID CONCERNS I HAVE</span><hr size=1> Kahlus, I have followed and observed a lot of alliances, and what I have said is my opinion and from what my experiences and discussion are.

Others may swear by those rules, but they are also different people with different needs and beliefs.<br><br>Keep in mind that the current CoG system is based on a class-based RANDOM system.  Who can honestly step up and claim that another looting system is fairer than a random system? If they do, then that definition of fairness is very specific and reflects a very specific viewpoint - again, I am not saying that is incorrect, but be aware that that definition of fairness is one-sided.  And because it's only one view of fairness, people will always argue about a system that has been created by a set of people - unless they are made quiet.  And that's what I have a problem with mostly, people being self-righteous about &quot;their&quot; system being better than others and acting accordingly. It is always somewhat biased to create a reward system that is based on one factor ONLY, no matter which system it is.<br><br>And yes, since this is not an alliance, we don't keep track of attendance... who are we to judge that a person who has attended 10 CoG raids is more deserving than another person who has attended 0 CoG raids, but 10 plane raids with another guild?  <br><br>&quot;Again I think you are taking the extreme here. You don't get a job because you don't want pay. You don't go to school because you don't want a degree. Everything you do, you do to further yourself, to gain something. Perhaps you do something to further someone else? You are still aiding your own causes by improving your &quot;standing&quot; (faction if you will) with that person. Don't misconstrue this is greed, as many seem to do.&quot;<br><br>I can only agree with you here.  People should be going BECAUSE they want to go and get something out of it.  For the CoG, I have always seen that as having fun and enjoying the game, not because of an item.  But by promising that they have a greater chance at gaining an item if they go more often, the focus is directed toward gaining an item, not gaining other things.  Unfortunately, this is what this game is mostly about, and especially with the planes... it is really just a game, noone has to go to the planes. <br><br>If you don't believe me that most activities on this server are item-focused, look around and see how many alliances organize non-item-getting events.  Ask your alliance to see how many events like the dance or the chess event or the walk through antonica have been organized by them.  <br><br>A lot of people on this server participate in events to get &quot;paid&quot; or because of fixed loyalties to a specific set of people, and I will always try to discourage that in whatever I do, just because I gain satisfaction out of that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->        <br><br>pip<br><br>p.s. scary, haemish, I have the same view about karma... you give something with no strings attached, and it will always be returned in some way or another, and in the way you least expect it. <p><HR><font size=2>Celtic: "Knowing [or Finding] the Oak Tree")....

Does he deserve it more than other people? Maybe. Does he deserve it more than the new pally? Yes, yes he does. And any of you who have won a roll on your own item while the older pally was there should be cheering for him to win something as well; anything else is not only unjust, it's selfish.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Khalus, this is a great point, and in that moment of decision, if I were that bloodied older paladin yes I'd feel cheated, I'd feel I deserved that item more by virtue of my sheer effort but in the end, I was denied that by my own bad luck.  And regardless of how much I've bled, regardless of how much I've fought, I'd be powerless to do anything about it.<br><br>The very nature of the KCoG is to give people the opportunity to experience things they might not be able to do on their own.  To be more specific - the KCoG allows small guilds shots at big guild opportunities.  Nowhere has it been mentioned that the KCoG is called upon to dictate who deserves what.  That's what big guilds are for.  That's what alliances are for.  If you want a better shot at getting an uber item, then the answer is to join an uber guild or an alliance that will provide you with that opportunity.  But you can't expect the KCoG which is not a governing body - just a focal point of everyone's efforts - to be called upon to determine who deserves what.<br><br>With that said however, I do believe there IS merit in the point system, but not with the way the KCoG is setup.  At it's most basic level, the KCoG is the ultimate pick up group and you all know how pickup groups go.  Because of that, there is no practical way we could implement a points based system.  I imagined it for a while a bit ago, and I thought to myself how this would drive me to drink:<br><br>/tell Kahlus ok you roll 130 1000<br>/tell Haemish ok you roll 160 1000<br>/tell Pippi ok you roll 190 1000<br>/tell Flarren you roll 550 1000<br>Fazlazen tells you, &quot;Dude what's my roll?&quot;<br>/tell Fazlazen haven't gotten to you yet<br>/tell Tanniss ok you roll 400 1000<br>Tanniss tells you &quot;wtf my roll should be 440&quot;<br>/tell Tanniss take it up with the attendance coordinator, he/she gave me these numbers<br>&lt;now we can't roll until this is resolved&gt;<br>Flarren sighs<br>Pippi munches on some Bixie crunchies while twisting her hair<br>Tanniss taps his foot impatiently<br>Somerandom dude asks if he can inspect you<br>SomeuberCleric tells you Did Ragefire pop?<br>Tanniss tells you &quot;he/she booted on zone and isn't back yet&quot;<br>/e begins to tremble nervously<br>SomeDude shouts &quot;When are we rolling&quot;<br>SomeDude shouts &quot;What's my roll range?&quot;<br>/tell Belce ok you roll 1 100<br>Belce tells you WTF, I'm a big barbarian, I'll slam your paladin ass all the way to the Nox Lair<br>/tell Belce ok 2 100<br>Belce tells you Oki!<br>Haemish tells you &quot;190 1000 right?&quot;<br>/tell Haemish wait a sec let me check<br>Lagdalen tells you never mind the bodies poofed<br><br>/q<br><br><br>Ok - a little of a dramatization - but I'd imagine it would go something like that.<br><br><br>I like our system.  <br><br>Simple is better.  <br><br>Losing 57 times in a row sucks, but hey that's life.<br><br>I agree with the spirit of what you're saying, but it can't be implemented from a practical standpoint plus I agree with Pippi that it places far too much emphasis on items rather than opportunity.  No, it's not perfect, but tampering with it and making it more complex will distract people from what the KCoG is trying to accomplish - plus there's a loophole to everything.  <br><br>So IMO, less = more.<br><br>But let me offer my own criticisms.  I suspect a 52 paladin that survived the fight because he had the requisite levels and resists would have a BIG problem losing a dragon book to a 40 paladin that died 13 seconds into the fight.  <br><br>I have a suggestion for this, give 50+ players a bonus on rolling for the books.  Level 50 rolls 1 600, level 51 rolls 1 700, level 52 rolls 1 1000, below level 50 rolls 1 500.  Or something to that effect.  This places faith in the Randomness of the roll, but still gives a bonus to those paladins who in my eyes truly do deserve the book more than the player 12 levels below them.<br><br>On the issue of effectiveness, I'm wondering if we need to raise the level limit on melees all around.  I honestly question the effectiveness of lvl 40-45 players (myself included - I only did 483 pts of damage to Vox and went back for heals 3x, but I did offer an LoH and last second battle heals).  Perhaps raising the level limit for melees to match that of casters might be in order.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is that someone level 40 was getting damaged far too quickly from clawings and AoE's to the point where they were recieving heals that should have gone to the level 50 warrior that was doing 60% more damage and lasting far longer.  <br><br><br>So I know I've rambled a bit, but just speakig what was on my mind.<br><br> <p><center><img src=http://64.37.109.125/everquest/sig.jpg></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umochaboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MochaBoy</A> at: 2/16/01 1:43:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/16/01 4:11:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR RAID CONCERNS I HAVE</span><hr size=1> Again, I'm not in favor of any type of system where loot is also based on level. It goes back to that thing of attaching an intrinsic value to someone's assistance. I'm a level 40, who's played for almost 2 years (with something like 44 days played, etc.) I know there are people with like 30 days played who are over level 50, due to lots more time, powerleveling, less deaths, less running around, for whatever reason. For planes, I can't even get in there for another 6-7 levels, though I'd go now if I could. So someone who's put less time into the game, and has had more opportunity to get to the planes than I is preferred over me? What is he just ebayed that character? <br><br>Here's why I always oppose preferential lottos. Where do you draw that oh so subtle thin blue line? Should guild leaders or the management body get preference? They often have to put more work into a raid than someone who just showed up. What about the level 56 guy who went LD right at the beginning of the fight in which his armour dropped? He fought for all of 2 seconds, but his level is higher, so he'd get preference. What about guilds who bring more people to the raid than other guilds? <br><br>There's a million ways you can split hairs on this issue, and a million scenarios you can show that could be considered fair, or completely unfair. In a single guild, or an alliance with fewer members, you can make a preferntial system that will be a little bit more fair but again, that's in a system where the definition of fair is more than likely fairly standard among all members. <br><br>Shoji makes a good point, that the CoG is like the ultimate pickup group, the difference being that we can do the large targets that bigger guilds can do. <br><br>I think, and have stated in the loot rules I use, that I don't think that ANY looting system will ever be 100% fair, so long as someone will get something while somoene else won't. Somebody is always going to feel like they got screwed, and the number of screwed feelings will go up as the number of people involved in the raid go up. I think that with the you bleed you roll system I use, yes, someone might get screwed, but I think that they won't feel that they were &quot;maliciously screwed&quot; by an unfair system or loot coordinator, but by random fate or chance. <br><br>I will say that I think anyone that wants to run a CoG plane raid (or any other type) is free to use whatever loot system they would like to, so long as the basic premise of fairness is maintained. I.e. if you are using a preferential system, announce it before hand, if you're trying to get X guildmate X item, tell people beforehand that that item is for him. That tends to get people really pissed off if you don't, as they then feel really screwed if they didn't know beforehand. <br><br>Haemish <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uminlain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Minlain</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/16/01 5:32:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FEAR RAID CONCERNS I HAVE</span><hr size=1> I agree with Haemish on all his posts and i do not believe he should take the blame as much as U are Haemish <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The biggest problem I have seen on all the raids i have gone is people DO NOT LISTEN and do what they are told. They think doing it their way is better but the reason raid management tells you to do something is they have the experience or it is for the good of the whole raiding party. <br> I am aware how hard for the clerics to rez plp because they have so many bodies to do and with the lack of clerics we have it makes this job even harder for them. My sugestion to make sure people get some of the experience back on a death is once we reenter planes after 1st death everyone loot their weapon and BP and then drag their bodies in one pile(and this is only for the bodies at camp) then if another death occures these bodies once looted the weapon should be placed in a second pile and so on. That way it makes it easier for the clerics to rez the oldest bodies 1st. I think this idea might have helped a little on the raid we had.

Heck while your at it Pay me to show up too, its not like I have any regular drops there (I dont count Cube drops)  and I have been to More Fear Raids than Hate.  I think Vaard (and Clerics that show, only name in Mind right now) is completely correct in the fact that why should he be one of the few clerics risking his EXP (no his exp is not more important than others but he is at least putting his on the line like the rest of us that show) in Fear just to Roll against 8 or more Clerics on a Cleric Item in Hate.

Yes he did Die both Times but he died barely less than 30 second before they did both times.  I can see raising it a few lvls for Melee's Like 42 or 43 but not to the same lvl as casters.
