heavily* I hate those....<br>
<br>
Jamany WAS part of a posting entity but still fought for the &quot;little guy&quot; and opposed the Rules even tho as a whole his guild accepted those same Rules... and benefitted from them. *looks a little baffled with this tactic* Is it just me or does this appear just a TAD hypocritical? His posting entity (and one would assume he as well by default) benefitted from these Rules but still he posts vehemently opposing the very Rules that allowed he and his friends to benefit.<br>
<br>
Jamany has been INVITED to attend Planes raids by those who are adhering to the Rules... but has &quot;declined&quot;... I would suppose its based on his &quot;morals&quot; here... and his desire to say &quot;See?!?... the Rules dont let ME go to the Planes!! They are UNFAIR!!!&quot; I suppose this is some sort of half-assed attempt to get us to change the rules to suit HIS desires by claiming he's being prevented from going to the Planes by &quot;showing&quot; us it isnt &quot;fair to EVERYONE&quot;.  *shrugs*<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Jamany... I hate to inform you of this... but your statemants have proven that in your case the Rules ARE working. You were part of an entity that followed procedure to get posting rights... by default you did as well by being in the same entity... that shows this part is working as intended. (You later quitting said entity is irrelevant since you make no statement as to WHY you left.... for all we know you were kicked out  *shrugs* ) Then you claim you've BEEN invited by others to attend the Planes... but you refused.... this is ALSO working as intended... whether you choose to accept the invite or not is irrelevant... the option was given to you. Refusing invitations then claiming the rules are unfair and prevent you from going to the Planes doesnt hold up to scrutiny.<br>
<br>
I know Jamany will continue to post... but as far as I'm concerned HIS specific issues are a closed matter. In both of his scenarios the Rules as they are currently worked FOR him... not AGAINST him... by his own statements he has shown us this.... and that was the intent of the Rules... and the reason they were so thoroughly debated prior to implementation. If anything he has PROVEN the Rules are working to the benefit of the &quot;little guy&quot; he claims to represent. <br>
<br>
Perhaps the Little Guys need a new spokesperson =)<br>

Second, your threats mean nothing.  Third, Bots was not asked into the raid.  They CAME in and took over.  Then INTENTIONALLY ran a train.<br>
<br>
Several posts say that making an indy day is not able to be &quot;POLICED&quot;.  Check the posts.  You will find this statement made more than once.  You don't police it or punish those posting entities that break it.  So what are you talking about?<br>
<br>
As far as what I am smoking?  A gentlemans agreement or player made agreement is only good if between the two parties involved.  If Zanthor goes to planes he has no agreement to uphold because none was made.  If you or anyone else attempts to do anything other than rant and rave, you can follow other guilds who have been disbanded for these acts.<br>
<br>
This is not a &quot;threat&quot; either.  But a verant noted fact!<br>

<br>
Let's make it really ugly so the server split is forced because we can't get along.<br>
<br>
Going to the  planes and essentially initiating a FFA is going to be almost comical,  I am sure you will not have benefitted anywhere near as much as if you had worked within the existing framework.<br>
<br>
I expect that everyone and their brother/sister who is planable will be there on Zanthor's FFA day.<br>
<br>
Of course you in your infinite wisdom have already taken this into account I am sure.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ohh and this part makes me laugh...<br>
<br>
&quot;you can follow other guilds who have been disbanded for these acts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Is that a promise?  I would like to drop three dragons in one night a week after being 'disbanded'<br>

Grundall, you're not getting it!<br>
<br>
Zanthor wants a raid that he can run with the minimum number of people that he picks, so his guild can run a raid solo.  Anybody going up there will be stepping on HIS toes, because HE RESERVED THE DATE.<br>
<br>
Of course, per zanthor, this calendar system is a joke because nobody can reserve a date and verant doesn't support it.<br>
<br>
Unless it's Zanthor reserving a date.<br>
<br>
I am still amused that someone like Zanthor or some of the other dissenters think that:<br>
<br>
* indy days 2x a month with a separate signup for guild raids and a 6-8 month wait between raids<br>
<br>
is a superior solution to<br>
<br>
* 2 guilds/groups of nonguilded people get together, get their numbers to 40, and make an agreement to swap fear/hate dates so that each guild gets to go to hate/fear every other month.<br>

K so per those whining we cant reserve a date but they will do so? Umm k... sure... (sits down confused)<br>

Jamany, got news for you. The gms will not do squat to anyone who shows that day on the 4th. PNP will be invoked and the zone will be shared. Plus you should consider this, if you think that the gms dont read this forum you are nuts. They read what is posted, they read any veiled threats, and they will react to such wether it be reasonable or not. <br>
<br>
As far as bots go, i think you have a personal vendetta against larger guilds. A lot of the posts are that uber so and so is doing this. BOTS has never wronged my guild. Heck Aegeis is in bots and i think hes great. There is no need to drag up what was an unpleasant incident that was caused by an INVITEE and drag their name through the muck. The incident is over, its done, we moved on. Slamming them only puts you on their blacklist as well as others who consider that a needless flame that serves no use to this conversation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15>Flame Central</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href="http://boh.thixo.net">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
