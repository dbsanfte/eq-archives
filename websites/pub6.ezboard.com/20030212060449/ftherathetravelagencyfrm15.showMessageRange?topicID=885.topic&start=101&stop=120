<br>
Just calling them as I see them. You will find extremely few people that I don't get along with or will say anything negative about.  Noto is the very very rare exception for me.<br>
<br>
Notouchie will camp a mob for you to help you on a quest?  I don't give a shit.  I've done it for many friends of mine and they've done it for me.  It's part of playing the game and being a nice person.  That doesn't excuse him for acting the way it does but people keep defending him based on it.  <br>
<br>
Notouchie is a great shaman?  I don't give a shit.  I know many people that are GREAT at their class, and can still act with class.  He can't, yet people defend him based on this.<br>
<br>
You say we shouldn't care how you run your guild but then say if we have a problem with anyone in it we should contact you?  Make up your mind, which is it?  Why the hell would I contact you about something when I know the reply would be &quot;oh, it's him, get over it, I'm not going to do anything about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
It doesn't take any effort at all to be civil in this game.  Notouchie puts zero effort into it.  He's a selfish, self-righteous prick to anyone he doesn't know and believes he has priority over everyone else in the game.  He's believes his enjoyment is more important than anyone elses.  I've seen his attitude first hand and it stinks.<br>
<br>
If you aren't going to do anything about it then have the balls to come out and say it.  Don't try to blow everyone off with this smokescreen about &quot; but he's really a good person if you just take the time to know him&quot; or &quot;but he's a really good person.&quot;<br>

Raiddar, that was the funniest thing I've ever read in my whole life.  Time to lay off the bottle, lol<br>
<br>
<br>
In terms of Notouchie, this is my opinion.<br>
Bitching and whinging about Noto has become a cool thing to do it seems for people who have nothing better to do on the Rathe.  I'm sure that there have been times that Noto has been wrong in trainging someone etc, but the way people look for any excuse to bash him has gotten out of hand.  Why would an entire guild constantly defend him if he were always wrong and this big bad shammy who loved to train and kill people?  Noto is easily the most skilled person I've ever played EQ with and doesn't play to be the big bad boogie man that everyone seems to have made him out to be.<br>
<br>
Corso, anyone from LoM can read what you claim noto said to you and tell right away that you are full of shit.  Noto isn't the type of person to swear at you for no reason.  Either you are bullshitting us or you left out the part where you gave him the reason to swear at you.  Although Raiddar may have taken it to the extreme, I agree with him, STFU and take it up with an officer.  Whah whah Xedd was busy when you tried to talk to him, well in case you hadn't noticed he's a guild leader and has a lot on his plate all the time.  I guarantee he will make time to speak to you about whatever it is that you need to tell him or bitch and whine about.  Don't come running over here like a little baby looking for approval from every other lame, no life idiot who has nothing better to do than look for every excuse to bitch about Notouchie.  After a while it gets really boring and no one really gives a shit about it anymore.  Lom knows what kind of person Noto is, and maybe if you weren't trying so hard to knock him for approval from all the other &quot;cool&quot; RTA flamers, you would take the chance to get to know him.<br>
<br>
Bitching and whining about Noto is not as &quot;cool&quot; as you think it is people.  Find a new hobby and stop praying on someone because others have and it has become the thing to do.<br>

<br>
I personally cant stand notouchie.  When I was in a prior guild 2 of my members were camping hand/WL for a few hours.  Notouchie zoned in and wanted the camp.. pulled it from them, trained them over and over killing them in the process.  They tried contacting Noto about it and he pulled his usual kid bullschitt.  I contacted Xedd (someone refered me to him from LoM) He fed me a line of BS... and then it came out (post on our forums) that he blew me off on purpose.  I dont dislike LoM  I dislike people.  Notouchie gets zero respect from me and many others (seems like half the server) because of his actions.  How many guilds would have reamed their members for training on purpose and stealing camps?  A whole lot because its unacceptable.  Just because its a game and I cant see you face to face dosnt make me less of a person than you or anyone else.  People log in and the thought of common human curtosy flys out the window.  <br>
<br>
The fact he can play his clas well has nothing to do with him going out of his way to prove he has no life by making sure people who have camps he would like miserable.  <br>
<br>
The game would be fine if there were less assholes.  <br>
<br>
ANYONE who defends this lowlife proves they are like him and deserves the same ammount of nevative respect.    <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.phantomwoulf.keith.org/Abella2.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->Abella ..........&lt;61st High Priestess, <br>

Look on the bright side everyone.  Odds are pretty good that he has trained his *own* guildmates from time to time.  (I have personally seen this happen once.)  It's not like he is a discriminating &quot;trainer.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I keep hearing rumors about him being a good shaman.  Who the hell cares?  If being good at your class was an excuse to be an asshole, the Rathe would be full of assholes.  My mistake, apparently it *is* an excuse now...<br>
