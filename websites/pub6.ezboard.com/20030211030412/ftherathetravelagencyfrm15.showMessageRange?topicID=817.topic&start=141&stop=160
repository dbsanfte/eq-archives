Why is it when someone  (we'll say christian or RELIGOUS as some of you say) speaks their opinion about a group they are intolerant, but when a group speaks their opinions about Christian's they are justified?  You did not like the Flamboyant guy at the store representing homosexual people, but then turn around and group RELIGIOUS all together.  Seems like a double standard, don't you think?<br>
People get morals from different places, some from parents, some from the MEDIA, and some from Religion, that is THEIR right not yours to tell them!!<br>
Also as stated earlier, this stuff is being jammed down innocent kids throats with childrens books and such which is wrong in my opinion.  I think it is wrong to influence kids with these!!  The Bible says to love everyone, and I do what I think many people have the problems with is the overwhelming pushing on people who don't want to hear or care what you do in your own privacy, and do not want there kids influenced by it.  <br>
If you think because people disagree with you, or have differing opinions, that they are intolerant or closeminded, then what makes yours right? Maybe because your opinion is different than others, maybe YOU are the closeminded ones and intolerant ones.<br>
I have no problems loving people, and if someone does something i don't agree with, I'm gonna love them anyway, but don't hate me cause i am different than you, because that is the same thing you are fighting for!! <p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Big Bad Bonedaddy&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif&gt;&lt;BR&gt;<br>

You see, racism and discrimination don't have a color. You don't have to be straight and white to be a racist.<br>
<br>
This is life in America, Where now the groups they call minorities can say what they want, when they want and to whom they want. <br>
<br>
While the majority group has the constitutional right to do the same, society brands them as deviants if they do so.<br>
<br>
I can't be proud of who I am and where I come from without be labeled a hater. That is the simple, honest truth.

homosexuality is not an evolutionary dead end.  It has continued to exist (in people, primates, sheep, and other animals) because it gives some sort of evolutionary advantage.  <br>
<br>
Historically it becomes more prevalent in societies that are overpopulated - so it may actually serve a positive purpose in curbing population growth.  I wouldn't call it a dead end, or an abberation.  <br>
<br>
<br>
But people are free to think whatever.. up to the point where they step on someone elses toes.  then, when you have to decide who's toes are getting stepped on the hardest vs who's toes are getting a pedicure + massage, who deserves to have bruised toes and who doesn't, who's too much of a wuss to stop their toes from being stepped on, who's too scary and mean to even have their toes tickled.....  it gets all complicated and silly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grullin>Grullin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/15/02 12:36:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=144>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: tibert the fag</span><hr size=1> This thread is hilarious, I went back and read it all.<br>

Most of you still don't get what people are trying to say. I don't hate you because you're different. In fact, I don't hate you at all, don't really hate anyone.<br>
<br>
I am displeased at the way things are. I am upset because what's good for one group is evil from another.<br>
<br>
I understand that a lot of people endure bad things from bad people every day. <br>
<br>
I was a dumb kid who was raised outside of racial issues, in a private school, made up of blacks, hispanics, and whites. Everyone got along and we just called each other friend.<br>
<br>
My family fell on hard times and I had to spend seventh grade in public school, The district we lived in had me go to a middle school that was mostly black, I didn't care it was just school to me. Unfortunatly a lot of those kids didn't like white people. <br>
<br>
I was beatup on a weekly basis, not to mention the verbal abuse which seemed like a welcome escape from the physical.<br>
I have issues to this day because of that school.<br>
<br>
Do I hate Black folks because of that? No I don't, To use a tired old cliche' one of my best friends I've ever had is black. But it honestly is true. Donald Hammock, I met him when I was in the Army and I'll always consider him one of the best friends I've ever had.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just wish people would understand that discrimination touches everyone, even straight white males. <br>
<br>
You need to understand that as long as you strive for exceptional treatment, you will be looked upon exceptionally and that is not always good for you.<br>
<br>
One last thing, GayEQPlayer you are a perfect example of what is wrong. If I came here posting my opinion on these issues, under an anonymous name there would be a lynching. I would get the biggest verbal beatdown of my life.<br>

Ok first off, I'm not &quot;afraid of having my feelings hurt&quot; - give me a break, I've had my feelings hurt tons of times, they get over it. I am not &quot;out&quot; in Norrath, nor do I wish to be. I have my own reasons for this and they are quite long and involved. I get to choose the situations where I am out about my sexuality and when I'm not. My sexuality has no bearing on my ability to play my character, therefore it really has no relevance in-game. I'm posting on this issue as myself, a gay person who plays (alot) of EQ - not as the character I play in Norrath. I don't really care if you think that's lame - its not like I came here to post a nasty story about one of the guilds or to celebrate the fact that I ninja looted something, so I wanted to remain anon. I'm posting about a highly personal and highly controversial topic and I prefer not to drag my toon and it's rep into this discussion - its just not relevant. /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=juryiel>Juryiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/15/02 3:44:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=817.topic&index=147>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: tibert the fag</span><hr size=1> As for kids and adoption, do you also think that heterosexual couples who can't have kids on their own should also not be able to adopt?  Not many families with 7 kids will chose to adopt you know.  If its only gays that you're talking about isn't that as much as a double standard as the minority/white racist issue that Gruilin is talking about?  And besides, if they can offer love/caring to a kid without parents, who cares if they're gay.  &quot;Omg the kid will grow up and have problems because blah blah...&quot;  That may be true, but I would think he'd have more problems growing up without parents going from foster home to foster home or to wherever else they send him.  And it all depends how he's brought up really.<br>
<br>
As for the marriage thing, though  they may not be producing taxpayers, I don't recall that being a requirement.  Now I'm not the most familiar with these things, but I never knew you had to produce a taxpayer to be married.  What about heterosexual couples who can't have kids or who won't have kids?  If you're going to go by that the law should be changed to not recognize marriages until a tax payer has been produced.  Either that or exempt gays from taxes all together, then that might actually make some sense.  <br>
<br>
And I do believe that Livius is right about that double standard also Kluz.  Sexual references are made by heteros all the time, why not gays?  I don't think its the best idea to keep quiet about being gay nor is it the best idea to make sure everyone within a 200 mile radius from you knows it.  But heck if its someone I know and talk to, they have every right to make sexual references about their life as I do about mine.  I know some gay people in EQ and out, and for example, when one of these peopel tells me &quot;So and so can suck the paint of a Buick&quot; in reference to his partner I don't cringe.  Because two lines earlier I've probably said to him something about some hot girl I met.  So going out of your way to make sure everyone knows you're gay is one thing, but being able to express your sexuality in the same way that heterosexuals around you can is another.  So yes I do agree with you on the whole marching around business, and the whole &quot;comming out&quot; thing, but on the other hand, you should also consider that you don't have to let the world know you're straight, it is automatically assumed unless you &quot;come out.&quot;  Everyone already knows you're straight unless otherwise told =/.  I wonder if you'd feel the same if it was reversed.  <br>
<br>
But this whole thing started over teh word &quot;gay.&quot;  Words are just there to represent meaning, nothing else.  The meaning of that word, no matter how much you may have thought it means homosexual, really did not.  Intentions &gt; words always.   <p>Juryiel Shadowangel&lt;br&gt;<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This means that you shouldn't ever refer to women in a sexual way Kluz. If you do you are asserting your heterosexuality and I'm sure all the gay people really don't care.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Even though this comment was more of a sarcastic backhanded stab at the fact that &quot;If they cant do it, then neither can you, Kluz&quot;, im sorry, but im going to have to fizzle it with &quot;Yes, you are correct. I shouldnt march around and wear my straightness as a badge either.&quot;<br>
<br>
And if you'll notice, I dont. Yes. Because nobody gives a fuck.<br>

<br>
Jurr, they NEVER really read what you write, do they?<br>
<br>
Heterosexual couples who cant have kids on their own are not choosing to not have kids on their own. Where did they forfeit the right of reproduction?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sexual references are made by heteros all the time, why not gays?

<br>
Absolutly. Theres always room for middle ground. I have a gay friend named David in COlumbus, and when we hang out and he sees a hot guy, he'll note it jsut like I would a hot girl. Sexual references is one thing. Its an expression of beauty, really. However, wearing your sexual preference on your shoulder, is completely different. I dont give a shit if &quot;being gay&quot; is what defines you. To be honest, if &quot;being gay&quot; defines you, you must a complete fucking loser devoid of all personality. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I know some gay people in EQ and out, and for example, when one of these peopel tells me &quot;So and so can suck the paint of a Buick&quot; in reference to his partner I don't cringe. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And kudos for you. But if I went up to you and said &quot;Man, I met this sweet fuckin honey last night, took her home and banged her...and she was only 11&quot; you WOULD cringe. And to many males, the idea of a male mouth on a cock is just as disgusting, and on the flip side, the idea of ANYONES mouth on a cock is disgusting, and they consider it just plain rude to be talking about sexual exploits in a social situation. Something to keep in mind.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>you should also consider that you don't have to let the world know you're straight, it is automatically assumed unless you &quot;come out.&quot; Everyone already knows you're straight unless otherwise told <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, but why is it anyones business? On a daily basis, I practice the fine art of &quot;not letting the world know im straight.&quot;. In high school, Matt Pao used to follow me around and call me a &quot;fucking faggot&quot; every day, and I laughed. This kid was a peice of shit, what do I care if he thinks im gay? Im not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But this whole thing started over teh word &quot;gay.&quot; Words are just there to represent meaning, nothing else. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Whats funnier? the fact that were being bitched at for giving &quot;gay&quot; a negative connotation? or the fact that a long time ago, homosexuals gave the word &quot;gay&quot; a bad connotation?<br>

#2: How the fuck did Jesus Christ get blond hair and blue eyes? <br>

#3: Why are there so many religions claiming to be the true one? Is Christianity the fake one? Maybe Tibetan monks know the real answer? Maybe the Egyptians did? Wheres your proof that the Bible wasn't written by a bunch of guys that are the same type of people that recorded events in Greece/Rome (about Zeus,Hercules), or Vikings (about Odin,Thor,etc). maybe all current religions are wrong? Maybe we die and our corpses rot into the Earth and this &quot;soul&quot; that we supposedly have doesn't exist? What if the Bible was 50% bullshit?
