(no, I don't consider the vote that went down in Iraq a few months ago a proper vote)<br>
<br>
Saddam's real crime, in my eyes, isn't developing weapons of mass destruction, it's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>using</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> those weapons against the Kurds.  Spending money ear-marked for repairing Iraq's roads, water pipes, power grids, hospitals, et all on tanks, guns, and training soldiers. (yes, I realise the damage to Iraq's infrastructure was caused by the US in the gulf war) For selling the food given by the UN and Red Cross to his starving citizens to Jordan and using that money to rebuild his damaged palaces.<br>
<br>
For not giving his citizens freedom.<br>
<br>
Yes, I know it's not polite to go around poking my nose in these countries, because it's none of my business, etc etc, but you know what?  That's bullshit, it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> my business.  Every time some foreign dictator murders some innocent child in Zaire or Iraq or Afghanistan, I'm obligated to step forward and say, &quot;Fuck that, that's not right,&quot; and take every step I can to make sure some other innocent child doesn't get murdered by a corrupt dictatorship.  Sue me for being a blind idealist, but I honestly believe every man, woman, and chield deserves the right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. (except French people)<br>
<br>
The reason Bush is going after Iraq instead of North Korea is because, sadly enough, it's more politically convenient.  If he was putting pressure on NK instead of Iraq, he'd be getting just as much internal flack in the US and in the UN for being a war monger etc, and would lose all the ground the US has gained with the PRC (not much, I know, but we're not looking at each other eyeball to eyeball wondering who's going to press the button first, like we were with the USSR) over the past 30 years.  Saddam is a known threat with a weak army we know we can beat into the sand while taking few casualties and be done with it in 3 weeks or less.  NK is more of an unknown, as are our relations with the PRC after such a conflict.  As much as I like to fix all the crap that's wrong with the PRC and NK, it's not worth another cold war.<br>
<br>
Think about it for a second- the worst-case scenario for Bush in a war with Iraq is getting 500 soldiers killed in action, and having &quot;short term worsened relations&quot; with France and Germany.  The worst case scenario with NK is a completely unkown number of soldiers killed in action, and having Cold War II with China.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying we shouldn't &quot;cancel&quot; NK's nuclear weapons program, just that we have to step a lot more lightly that we have to with Iraq.<br>
<br>
ps, and don't accuse me of blindly believing everything the media says.  It's an old, tired argument, and I assure you I can see through the spin the media puts on all its news, in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>both</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> directions, (Yes, our left wing media is just as biased as our right wing media!) as well as you can.<br>

<br>
FRANCE<br>
<br>
&quot;France has neither winter nor summer nor morals. Apart from these drawbacks it is a fine country. France has usually been governed by prostitutes.&quot;<br>
---Mark Twain<br>
<br>
&quot;I would rather have a German division in front of me than a French one behind me.&quot;<br>
--- General George S. Patton<br>
<br>
&quot;Going to war without France is like going deer hunting without your accordion.&quot;<br>
--Norman Schwartzkopf<br>
<br>
&quot;We can stand here like the French, or we can do something about it.&quot;<br>
---- Marge Simpson<br>
<br>
&quot;As far as I'm concerned, war always means failure&quot;<br>
---Jacques Chirac, President of France<br>
<br>
&quot;As far as France is concerned, you're right.&quot;<br>
---Rush Limbaugh,<br>
<br>
&quot;The only time France wants us to go to war is when the German Army is sitting in Paris sipping coffee.&quot;<br>
--- Regis Philbin<br>
<br>
&quot;The French are a smallish, monkey-looking bunch and not dressed any better, on average, than the citizens of Baltimore. True, you can sit outside in Paris and drink little cups of coffee, but why this is more stylish than sitting inside and drinking large glasses of whiskey I don't know.&quot;<br>
--- P.J O'Rourke (1989)<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, the French remind me a little bit of an aging actress of the 1940s who was still trying to dine out on her looks but doesn't have the face for it.&quot;<br>
---John McCain, U.S. Senator from Arizona<br>
<br>
&quot;You know why the French don't want to bomb Saddam Hussein? Because he hates America, he loves mistresses and wears a beret. He is French, people.&quot;<br>
--Conan O'Brien<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know why people are surprised that France won't help us get Saddam out of Iraq. After all, France wouldn't help us get the Germans out of France!&quot;<br>
---Jay Leno<br>
<br>
&quot;The last time the French asked for 'more proof' it came marching into Paris under a German flag.&quot;<br>
--David Letterman<br>
<br>
How many Frenchmen does it take to change a light bulb?<br>
One. He holds the bulb and all of Europe revolves around him.<br>

That was from Derae.  To which I retort what a load of shit.  Let's see England and America fought two wars yet ended up not only not hating each other but solid Allies for almost a century now.<br>
<br>
How about Germany and Japan.  The US and Britain fought a war with them.  Strange how none of those countries are breeding hate or desperate people looking for revenge.<br>
<br>
In this country its very citizens turned against each other, we ransacked and burned cities, crops etc yet when the war ended neither side bred hate or desperate people looking for revenge.  Well, admittedly I do hate Southerners and I know there are southerners who feel the same way about northerners but we're not fighting over it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yes, but I have heard dimwits describing going to war as a wrong without analyzing the merits. <br>
<br>
&quot;My only real thought with all of this is that where there is even a glimmer of hope that peace can be achieved without war and death then surely it is our duty to pursue that.&quot; <br>
<br>
France, Earth, 1938.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I really can't stand ignorance.  People who think peace for peace sakes without analyzing the situation are every bit as ignorant and dangerous to the world as people who jump on the bandwagon with war.  <br>
<br>
There are good reasons to go to war.  There have ALWAYS been good reasons to go to war and whats more there will ALWAYS be good reasons to go to war.  <br>
<br>
Threatening a nation's financial security is threatening a nation's sovereignty by the way.  This is why the Iraq situation begs immediate action.  It is an immediate threat.  <br>

North Korea threatens the security of its neighboring nations, but to date, has shown no other ability to affect US interests.  If they do so much as step across the border into South Korea they will be lit up like a Roman candle.  <br>
<br>
Also, even if the US wanted to go into N. Korea (which we don't want to) there is the fact that N. Korea borders a super power that would not take too kindly to having US troops beside it.  The reverse of that is that China is not the same China it was in the 50's and there is a strong chance they would actively frown upon N. Korea actively destabilizing the region.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for distracting me from work.<br>

In summation,  Did not cooperate with previous resolutions.<br>

Personally i disllike the french because for the last 12 years they have supported the droppiong of sanctions so Iraq could sell the oil for the money they owe france for the weapons and necluar power plant stuff they have been &quot;selling&quot; to Iraq. France does not want us invading because they know we will find weapons being fired at us markked &quot;made in France&quot;. Remember, in the mid/late 80's, most the parts that actually made it into Iraq for the super gun before the Israles killed Gerald Bull were supplied through France, the parts that were siezed were siezed in England. Those parts that made it were destroyed by thie inital inspectors after the gulf war. Russia is generally in the same position with Iraq having sold weapons to them, but so did the US during the Iran/Iraq war.. When push comes to shove, Russia will either abstain or throw in with us, Germany will abstain and not veto but i firmly belive France will veto for the above mentioned reasons, they don't want to get caught.<br>

Do you really think your immune to whats going on?  After EVERYTHING America has done for you and your countries you sit here and tell me &quot;90% if the world share our views.&quot;  So lemme see...90% of the world are a bunch of pussified fuckheads who would let a madman do whatever he wants to women and children, not only in his own lands but yours as well (when he walks in, kicks your asses, and takes over, of course).<br>
<br>
YOU are the people who make me ashamed to be a Human being.  &quot;Two wrongs dont make a right,&quot; but a single asskicking can SET things right.  It's people like you, who hold up &quot;Love and Peace&quot; signs and are so idiotic as to believe that world peace could be assured if we all just put down our guns.  You know what?  The last person to drop their gun is the first one to take over.<br>
<br>
Tell the Firefights, Civilians, Military Personnel, and Policemen who died in 09/11 that were not going to avenge them.  Tell them your willing to sit back and let it happen again.  Tell them you dont care about Human life, and that you would let a mass-murdering fuckhead in your own back door, that you rather watch because &quot;it didnt effect you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well guess what...when France got &quot;invaded&quot; (read - 3 German scouts walked in and declared France theirs) it didnt effect the US...and we still gave you your damn country back.<br>
<br>
Fuck NATO who holds the US by the balls, fuck you who would dishonor the memory of those who died by not avenging them and bringing about what is truly right, and fuck you all who think Im just a Warmonger.<br>
<br>
I'm not a cowardly piece of Human shit, and *I* wont sit by and let mass-murdering fuckheads come in and do what they please.  Even if it's only to save YOUR worthless asses, it's my duty as a HUMAN BEING and NOT just a Soldier to help whoever I can.<br>
<br>
You stand by...let things go where their going...and when the Eiffel Tower falls...then you remember what you have shown here today when we refuse to Veto and run to your rescue again.  Frankly, your kind are no longer worth it.  Good British and American blood will be spilled in honor of the 09/11 sacrifices and to prevent it from happening to you, so you dont have to know our pain, sadness, or anger.  And frankly...that makes me sad.  The fact that you would ignore the heros out there risking their lives so you can sick your fucking cappuccino.<br>
<br>
Frankly, as I walk into combat, I'll be sure to think the same thing of you and my enemy.<br>
