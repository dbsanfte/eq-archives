<br>
as for the 1/3rd of the french backing saddam, I read that too, and it is not the real truth.<br>
<br>
The fact is not that people want saddam to win the war, hell no. But french people have been so bitched at in the last few months for just voicing their opinion, that they are tired of it, and are just &quot;grumbling&quot;. But do they really want to see saddam winning? no.<br>
<br>
I honestly dont know what i would have answered to that if i was asked. I dont want american deaths, no. I dont want either iraqi deaths or english deaths. I am not even a pacifist, but i do think that war wasnt justified. Not going to elaborate again on that.<br>
<br>
What i would love is that you win this war, fast with minimal deaths (bad start already), and you find no weapons of massive destruction. I would laugh my ass off, and that would prove we were right, and that you killed US and english and iraqi people for nothing.<br>
<br>
If you would find these kind of weapons, i would be the first to say i am sorry. But i highly doubt that will ever happen. <p>&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a target=&amp;quot;new&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=156296&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Malaka's Profile&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=joekreeper1>joekreeper1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 322<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/3/03 9:07:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shameful</span><hr size=1> Bad start?<br>

WMD are not the ONLY reason we are there (Incoming cheap shot on the French) but we know France and Germany have historicaly taken the side of moustasched dicators who rule by terror, murder political opposition, and gas their own people.<br>

We are not violating U.N. rules by forcibly removing Saddam.  What we did, is started a military campaign without the backing of the U.N. which we do not need by any means.  If Saddam had a vendetta against Zimbabwe or some other tiny Nation, surely they'd need support, but seeing as we have by far the largest military in the world, both in numbers and in technology, it's a different story.  <br>
<br>
   Personally all I think you're doing by holding out is burning a very important diplomatic bridge.  Why you would back Iraq is beyond me.  Don't say you're not backing them either...there are only 2 sides, either you help us, or you help them.  What purpose does it serve?  You KNOW that Saddam will be removed and that we're going to put in a fair democratic government.  You KNOW that we are going help rebuild the country to a point where the people can prosper, so why wouldn't you want onboard?  <br>

What human being would ever LAUGH HIS ASS OFF over the deaths of other human beings.  Oh a Frenchie would.  That makes sense.  Nothing a Frenchie loves more than other nations soldiers dying to overthrow a dictator.  I am just suprised we haven't seen French Soldiers in Iraqi uniforms firing at us.  They are certainly the class of the world.<br>
<br>
I'm sure France would love for the US/UK forces not to find any WMD so they can all gather around their little Eiffel Tower and circle jerk about it and scream to the world how &quot;right&quot; the righteous French are.<br>
<br>
No matter how &quot;right&quot; you think you are, it doesn't hide the fact that a good portion of your class citizens would rather have Saddam stay in power and continue to oppress his people then to have the US/UK remove Saddam.<br>
<br>
Did it really surprise anyone when the French want to make sure they are not excluded in the rebuilding of Iraq after they tried everything possible to stop the war from happening.<br>

The UN is a useless, petty bureaucracy that spends more time debating what country gets to provide cheese and crackers for the Christmas party than it does on resolving real world issues.

   What's ironic is that Iraq will be heading up the U.N. Meeting on Global Disarmament in May.  Somehow I think they'll have a much different tune to sing that they thought they would in January when their turn came up assisting will be thier long time nemisis Iran, won't that be fun?<br>

Yes, it is called money.  Cling to whatever excuse you want, but it boils down to France's government losing money.  As I linked in another thread, France's primary concern (now that war is unstoppable) is getting their hands on the rebuilding process and landing contracts that will guarantee them a cash flow from Iraq.  Why?  Because they just lost the one they had when the coalition went in.  They could no longer maintain their food for oil (remind anyone else of beads for land used on Native Americans?) or other lucarative contracts.<br>

However, while there is a time to criticize, there is also a time to follow in complacent silence. And that time is now.<br>
<br>
It's one thing to question our leaders in the days leading up to a war. But it is another thing entirely to do it during a war. Once the blood of young men starts to spill, it is our duty as citizens not to challenge those responsible for spilling that blood. We must remove the boxing gloves and put on the kid gloves. That is why, in this moment of crisis, I should not be allowed to say the following things about America:<br>
<br>
Why do we purport to be fighting in the name of liberating the Iraqi people when we have no interest in violations of human rights—as evidenced by our habit of looking the other way when they occur in China, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Syria, Burma, Libya, and countless other countries? Why, of all the brutal regimes that regularly violate human rights, do we only intervene militarily in Iraq? Because the violation of human rights is not our true interest here. We just say it is as a convenient means of manipulating world opinion and making our cause seem more just.<br>
<br>
That is exactly the sort of thing I should not say right now.<br>
<br>
This also is not the time to ask whether diplomacy was ever given a chance. Or why, for the last 10 years, Iraq has been our sworn archenemy, when during the 15 years preceding it we traded freely in armaments and military aircraft with the evil and despotic Saddam Hussein. This is the kind of question that, while utterly valid, should not be posed right now.<br>
<br>
And I certainly will not point out our rapid loss of interest in the establishment of democracy in Afghanistan once our fighting in that country was over. We sure got out of that place in a hurry once it became clear that the problems were too complex to solve with cruise missiles.<br>
<br>
That sort of remark will simply have to wait until our boys are safely back home.<br>
<br>
Here's another question I won't ask right now: Could this entire situation have been avoided in the early 1990s had then-U.S. ambassador to Iraq April Glaspie not been given sub rosa instructions by the Bush Administration to soft-pedal a cruel dictator? Such a question would be tantamount to sedition while our country engages in bloody conflict. Just think how hurtful that would be to our military morale. I know I couldn't fight a war knowing that was the talk back home.<br>
<br>
Is this, then, the appropriate time for me to ask if Operation Iraqi Freedom is an elaborate double-blind, sleight-of-hand misdirection ploy to con us out of inconvenient civil rights through Patriot Acts I and II? Should I wonder whether this war is an elaborate means of distracting the country while its economy bucks and lurches toward the brink of a full-blown depression? No and no.<br>
<br>
True patriots know that a price of freedom is periodic submission to the will of our leaders—especially when the liberties granted us by the Constitution are at stake. What good is our right to free speech if our soldiers are too demoralized to defend that right, thanks to disparaging remarks made about their commander-in-chief by the Dixie Chicks?<br>
<br>
When the Founding Fathers authored the Constitution that sets forth our nation's guiding principles, they made certain to guarantee us individual rights and freedoms. How dare we selfishly lay claim to those liberties at the very moment when our nation is in crisis, when it needs us to be our most selfless? We shame the memory of Thomas Jefferson by daring to mention Bush's outright lies about satellite photos that supposedly prove Iraq is developing nuclear weapons.<br>
<br>
At this difficult time, President Bush needs my support. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld needs my support. General Tommy Franks needs my support. It is not my function as a citizen in a participatory democracy to question our leaders. And to exercise my constitutional right—nay, duty—to do so would be un-American.<br>

Spoken by someone with their head truly up their ass and oblivious to the world.  Twelve years of repeated resolutions etc.<br>
<br>

<br>
Coulda/woulda/shoulda.  Hind-sight is 20/20.  What happened, happened.  You have to learn from your mistakes and deal with the present.  The fact that mistakes were made in the past is not sufficient reasoning for the perpetuation of those mistakes.  Using this person's logic, we may have well just kept slavery around or even segregation.  They were mistakes, but hey... once you made em, you gotta keep em.  What an idiot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Should I wonder whether this war is an elaborate means of distracting the country while its economy bucks and lurches toward the brink of a full-blown depression?&quot;<br>
<br>
Again... head + ass = oblivious.  The .com bubble burst leading to the downward spiral.  It has been dropping every since.  The war has not helped it though, but it started before all of this stuff.<br>
<br>
&quot;What good is our right to free speech if our soldiers are too demoralized to defend that right, thanks to disparaging remarks made about their commander-in-chief by the Dixie Chicks?&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, head + ass = oblivious.  Popular sentiment by the demographic that constitutes most of the Dixie Chicks' fan base settled that issue.  They had the right to say it.  You also notice how -$$$ lured them into a (I'm sure) heartfelt apology.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is not my function as a citizen in a participatory democracy to question our leaders. And to exercise my constitutional right—nay, duty—to do so would be un-American.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are executing your right to be stupid quite well, however.  No one has told anyone that they couldn't speak their mind.  The resistance you see is from other citizens speaking their mind, which happens to be different from yours.  Because of this, you are now squawking like the idiot you are claiming your rights are being violated.  YOU go down to the street corner right now and profess your ideas until you can no longer speak.  No one will stop you as long as you are doing it lawfully.  To claim that you cannot do this is simply a case of your being a complete moron.<br>
