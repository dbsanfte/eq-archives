I have friends that send me tells almost daily saying that I should join there guild. Does that mean the guild is recruiting me???? Hell no it means that my friends want me in there guild. This all seems like a misunderstanding blowen way out of porportion. In my experiance as a member SoTE has been nothing but fair and mature about every situation we have come across. I would be highly surprised if any of the leadership made a decision to activly recruit from any guild. It is out of character. I am not speaking from the guild in this message just giving me feedback. I would say lets end this post and let by gones be by gones. There is no reason to create friction between the guilds.

I posted 2 whole sentences on the matter, explaining that he wasn't a member and that he had rescinded his application.  I was just informing people of his status.  If you think that's being defensive then so be it.<br>

I also made it very clear to her before she de-tagged that she take it up with FS's leadership to make sure everything was okay.<br>
<br>
And things were okay, until many FS started pointing fingers, etc. Of course we were also blamed for the defection of a member of The Dragon Dynasty for a short while before it became clear that we did no recruiting of said person. <br>
<br>
As far as SotE trying to recruit members from Fallen Shadows, this is true... Netlha (sp?) and maybe some others tried recruiting certain members. However, this is in no way related to Vamps merging with SotE, nor did any Vamps condone this. In fact, when I learned about it, I made sure he stopped trying to recruit from Fallen Shadows. <br>
<br>
It's unfortunate that people jump to conclusions. I've always been the kind of person that is easily accessible for discussion if someone has problems / concerns. It's too bad no one tried asking me face to face, before assuming the worst.<br>

<br>
I got numerous tells from this person to come join SoTE, in the dreams of phat lewts and 'get in before it's too late'. I liked to play with him, act all interested.. let him give out his speel and say &quot;oh, let me think about it.&quot; <br>
<br>
Was a fun game, the first 3 or 4 times he/she/it contacted me..<br>
<br>
after that, it got annoying and i am glad SoTE put a stop to it. <br>
<br>
I think recruiting from guilds is low, and i think just sending cold tells to unguilded people are low.. gawd, it's like being a freakin' telemarketer in the game. <br>

<br>
I always liked the approach of letting the recruits come to you instead of pushing people to apply.<br>
<br>
Build the guild they want to join, build a name for yourself, and the members will find your establishment. The most loyal guild members aren't recruited, they come to the decision that the guild is right for them on their own.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, though, recruiting handlers might get into a bit of a frenzy trying to fulfill their duties and bring in new people, to the point of advertising their guild to complete strangers. A low tactic and one that, once recognized, should be put to a stop. In the end it hurts a guild more than it helps.<br>

Any guild...any guild that attempts to recruit from another guild, at least to me, is a lame ass guild. I've had it happen numerous times with one guild in particular...and it irks me to no end.  Oh sure..I get the posts &quot;If you're confident in your members being happy..why worry?&quot;. Its not the point...its a total lack of respect to do such a thing. <br>
<br>
CoN has a rule that if you leave a guild..you have to wait a month to join so it doesnt appear as if you were recruited or such. Not to mention, it allows the applicant time and the guild time to be sure the choice they make is the right one.  <br>
<br>
I dont necessarily agree that sending tells to a person is a bad thing if they are unguilded, Laylana / Gniess...many are pleasantly suprised, and I've even had some decline, but say it was nice to know that an old time guild had sought them out.  I personally think its all in the approach. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malakarude>MalakaRude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF Rep</span><br>  Posts: 425<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/16/03 12:51:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=979.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dhbergen/malaka.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Re</span><hr size=1> The problem with that karas is itsnt the fault of the guild it self if people apply to it. For an example, VoF has always been SoT recruiting ground til they splitted up (even I applied there just before it poofed) But could we blame the leadership of SoT for that? no of course.<br>
<br>
In the past 6 months, VoF got a LOT of applies from guys of anoher guild. can they blame us for that? no we never gave them tells to recruit. Actually i dont think any guild has &quot;recruiters&quot;, it is just peeps that likes the guild, so they tell their older friends, &quot;you should come, it is very fun and all&quot;. We cant really do anything against that.<br>
<br>
As for the rule of &quot;1 month&quot;, in most of the guilds (well it is the case for VoF, and we arent alone) you have to raid and prove your willing to join for at least 1 month before even getting a trial membership tag, so i dont think it would help ;p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grulnick>Grulnick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User and Abuser!</span><br>  Posts: 570<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/16/03 1:49:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=979.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Re</span><hr size=1> Well, when I played a certain cleric that will remain nameless that was guildless at the time, I got quite a few random tells from BoTS people......<br>
