<br>
This is a new thing for us. Nobody said it would be easy. We will be devoting some of our time to this area in the very near future.<br>
With that said, keep the following things in mind:<br>
<br>
1. We could be doing one something which mass amounts of people have been endlessly whining about.<br>
<br>
2. We are slowly working out strats for each North Wing mob we encounter, and they will be revised and fine-tuned as we move along. We failed to kill Eashan tonight, but what we learned in the process will enable us to kill him next time. <br>
<br>
3. I know the pulls can be boring. I keep a very close eye on them (using bind sight on pullers) and I will try to keep you all informed as to what's going on. <br>
<br>
4. Don't bother our Minks!! As I said, I keep a close eye on things and always know what's going on, if you have an urgent question, ask me. Don't be that @#%$ who's whining because the mob(s) aren't being pulled or split fast enough. You're the one sitting on your ass. They are the ones out there doing it.<br>
<br>
We aren't going to stop killing Dain, Zlandicar, Klandicar, or anything else for that matter. We won't lose Yelinak as a goal, or stop farming armor. But this is something new, something (I think) is exciting, and challenging. All good things take time.. be patient!<br>

BTW, don't pretend for a second as if you entered the Vyemm fight the same way we did. FoH told me to fight him at PoM but I fought him where I wanted to and it worked out damn well. After watching us in ToV for the last couple of months, you decide to fight him at the exact same place. Quite a coincidence.<br>
<br>
Anyway, NToV was not spoiled for us, at all. Krill and I figured out every pull ourselves. Neku/Mj/Myself figured out the rest. Grats on the kill, but don't let your balls grow too much. They'll get crushed. ;-)<br>

<br>
Merton - I hate to say it...but your posts are pretty lame themselves as well.  Vyemm is a hard dragon.  Endo killed him...who cares how they did it or how many they had.  It really DOES NOT MATTER.  Vyemm is dead.  Say Grats and move along.  <br>
<br>
You said &quot;I'm just saying that it shouldn't be rubbed in our noses like it was last night considering the excessive amounts of clerics and warriors used on a mob that's simply melee.&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't see a single post in this thread rubbing it in anyone's nose before you said anything.  It was simply a congratulatory thread on a very wonderful accomplishment, until Siyni came along.  Yet, you seem to be threatened by it, so view it as you like.  However, you really do just need to move along.<br>

<br>
Most of the time, apart from very long DB mobs (aka Vulak) a rogue will outdamage a wiz. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This comes from experience.  It's not so much the DPS though.  I can outdamage most rogues in DPS, but it's the aggro.  Evade &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  concussion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Being able to take a punch makes a difference now to me as a wiz than it used to though for this reason.  Getting aggro on a Ntov dragon/flurry means I am toast most of the time, however on a lot of other things being able to take aggro and not fold like a piece of tissue paper allows me to up DPS a lot.  There are other ways to go about working up your dps as a wiz of course (and I can't wait to eventually get some of the AP things such as subtlety) but for where I am at right now, personally, I have to really chain my ass off to KS rogues, and sometimes I still don't get more damage in.  (The other night we were doing west wing with a couple groups and I was burning like crazy and getting aggro, and still couldn't KS the rogues in the other group. I just ended up tanking while they sat behind the mobs and backstabbed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Point being, right now it's very hard for wiz to outdamage rog unless you can seriously overburn and either not get aggro / handle the aggro.<br>
<br>

Did he die? yes.  Does it drive LoS crazy? yes.  Will they ever say congratulations without disclaimers? no.  These are all facts.<br>

Btw, I heard no talk of anyone conferring with anyone, and I was online for the 1st attempt, and there for the 2nd and the kill.  ( i came just to spot heal and help, then ended up in the rotation, didn't know we we would <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> win</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->).<br>

BUT... a friend asked what the stats were on the pally hammer today, and I flipped to the bestiary.  I think I'd checked out Vyemm's loot before, but upon closer inspection this time...<br>

<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/monsterpics/lord_vyemm.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Hey wait a minute!<br>
<br>
Isn't that just about the spot we killed him? (cept we didnt push him into the corner like AL in this pic.  The positioning we used probably made it a little more difficult than the one in this pic.<br>
<br>
Would it be easier pushing him into the wall? DUNNO! haha<br>
<br>
Had I ever noticed this picture? no...<br>
Did I know where LoS stuck Vyemm? no....<br>
Did anyone mention where LoS stuck Vyemm? no...<br>
Did we discuss where/how to stick him throughout the first two attempts? yes...<br>
<br>
and the question of the hour...<br>

OMG, DID LOS LOOK AT THIS PICTURE BEFORE KILLING VYEMM?!  This could tear apart the very fabric of their &quot;innovative strategist&quot; reputation.<br>

Slithe: No, it proves that your argument stating that loot has everything to do with how efficient a guild will be is silly. And I also believe they killed Lendiniara the Keeper a few months back with the same types of numbers, as another more fitting example.<br>
<br>
Anyways, the thread is getting somewhat repetetive now, so it's time to fade away until the next one pops up. It's been fun! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilynnamaytidilaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milynna Mayti Dilaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lazy druid!</span><br>  Posts: 1399<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/02 12:16:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335flamesandrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2354.topic&index=111>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: :oP</span><hr size=1> amazing how many replies this got in less than 24 hours. <br>

It is quite an accomplishment.<br>
<br>
Personally I have 0 animosity toward any person/guild anywhere, and if you want to see this as a disclaimer, then you can view it however you want.  I just feel that a guild or group coming in after the majority of the area has already been killed, just to get to one of the boss mobs is tacky, however, I do understand why you did it.<br>
<br>
Imagine a place like PoA where people often log at some of the non-kos areas to continue going the next day (least they used to).  Imagine if you come back the next day, and someone jumped past where you had cleared to, to get to the next island and get the next boss.  I mean ya you got to your destination, but you didnt make the whole journey.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I truely want to congratulate you guys on your kill.  Hope to see continued success from both guilds. <p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"

You guys are faster then us, more powerful then us, and have the ability to work the zone at 10am on a week day.   That said and done if we want to achieve our goals we have to take em when opportunity knocks.  If there is another way we're open to suggestions. <p><center><image src="http://home.cfl.rr.com/mfuller/asmo_sig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udrainer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drainer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Group 9</span><br>  Posts: 802<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/9/02 5:34:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335flamesandrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2354.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Merton</span><hr size=1> Hi Meren<br>
