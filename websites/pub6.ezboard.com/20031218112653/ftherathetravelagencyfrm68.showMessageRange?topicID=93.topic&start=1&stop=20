BUSH RESUME <br>
The White House, USA <br>
<br>
* ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT: <br>
* I attacked and took over two countries. <br>
* I spent the U.S. surplus and bankrupted the Treasury. <br>
* I shattered the record for biggest annual deficit in history. <br>
* I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. <br>
* I set all-time record for biggest drop in the history of the stock market. <br>
* I am the first president in decades to execute a federal prisoner. <br>
* I am the first president in US history to enter office with a criminal record. <br>
* In my first year in office I set the all-time record for most days on vacation by any president in US history.<br>
* After taking the entire month of August off for vacation, I presided over the worst security failure in US history.<br>
* I set the record for most campaign fund raising trips by any president in US history. <br>
* In my first two years in office over 2 million Americans lost their job.<br>
* I cut unemployment benefits for more out-of-work Americans than any other president in US history. <br>
* I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. <br>
* I appointed more convicted criminals to administration positions than any president in US history. <br>
* I set the record for the fewest press conferences of any president since the advent of TV. <br>
* I signed more laws and executive orders amending the Constitution than any other president in US history. <br>
* I presided over the biggest energy crises in US history and refused to intervene when corruption was revealed. <br>
* I presided over the highest gasoline prices in US history and refused to use the national reserves as past presidents have.<br>
* I cut health care benefits for war veterans.<br>
* I set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously take to the streets to protest me (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind.<br>
* I dissolved more international treaties than any president in US history. <br>
* I've made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in US history. <br>
* Members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in US history. (The 'poorest' multimillionaire, Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her).<br>
* I am the first president in US history to have all 50 states of the Union simultaneously go bankrupt. <br>
* I presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud in any market in any country in the history of the world. <br>
* I am the first president in US history to order a US attack and military occupation of a sovereign nation, and I did so against the will of the United Nations and the world community.<br>
* I have created the largest government department bureaucracy in the history of the United States. <br>
* I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more than any other president in US history. <br>
* I am the first president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the Human Rights Commission.<br>
* I am the first president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the Elections Monitoring Board.<br>

* I withdrew from the World Court of Law.<br>
* I refused to allow inspectors access to US prisoners of war and by default no longer abide by the Geneva Conventions.<br>
* I am the first president in US history to refuse United Nations election inspectors access during the 2002 US elections.<br>
* I am the all-time US (and world) record holder for most corporate campaign donations.<br>
* The biggest lifetime contributor to my campaign, who is also one of my best friends, presided over one of the largest corporate bankruptcy frauds in world history (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation). <br>
* I spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in US history. <br>
* I am the first president to run and hide when the US came under attack (and then lied, saying the enemy had the code to Air Force 1) <br>
* I am the first US president to establish a secret shadow government. <br>
* I took the world's sympathy for the US after 911, and in less than a year made the US the most resented country in the world (possibly the biggest diplomatic failure in US and world history). <br>
* I am the first US president in history to have a majority of the people of Europe (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and stability.<br>
* I am the first US president in history to have the people of South Korea more threatened by the US than by their immediate neighbor, North Korea. <br>
* I changed US policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. <br>
* I set the all-time record for number of administration appointees who violated US law by not selling their huge investments in corporations bidding for gov't contracts. <br>
* I have removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any other president in US history. In a little over two years I have created the most divided country in decades, possibly the most divided that the US has been since the civil war. <br>
* I entered office with the strongest economy in US history and in less than two years turned every single economic category heading straight down.<br>
<br>
<br>

* I was AWOL from the National Guard and deserted the military during a time of war. <br>

* All records of my tenure as governor of Texas have been spirited away to my father¹s library, sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. <br>
* All records of any SEC investigations into my insider trading or bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. <br>
* All minutes of meetings of any public corporation for which I served on the board are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. <br>
* Any records or minutes from meetings I (or my VP) attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review. <br>
<br>

Is this real? Can this statement be quantified? How do state governments go bankrupt? and wouldn't that be somewhat HUGE economic news if all 50 blew out at once?<br>

Wrong, the stock market started to drop like a rock about a year before hand, it was just up so high because of the internet boom nobody noticed. The problem was billions of dollars being invested in companies that produced nothing, existed only as a name with a &quot;.com&quot; after it and for the most part had no buisness plan. Napster, a great service, but a free service that produced nothing, had billions of dollars invested in it..........how can that be profitable? That is why the economy went south it was just bad timing on Bushes part that he got elected when he did. People are just to stupid and reactionary to make the connection.<br>

But the allegation here appears to be that Bush sold his stock to “cash out” before the company went bankrupt. Bush sold his stock for $4.00 per share. A year later, the stock was valued at $8.00 per share. The company, Harken Energy Corporation, is still functioning.

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using tax-payer money. Biggest move: Traded Sammy Sosa to the Chicago Cubs.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Bush only owned 5% of the team. Sammy Sosa only played for the Rangers for 25 games. His record as a Ranger? 84 at-bats, and only 1 home run. His batting average was .238. (Source: ESPN.com, &quot;Sammy Sosa&quot;) The Rangers aren’t the only team to have built a taxpayer-funded stadium, either: Since the early 1950s, only one baseball stadium was built without taxpayer money, while 19 baseball stadiums were 100 percent taxpayer-funded. (Source: Small Business Survival Committee, “You’re Out: Corporate Welfare for Major League Baseball”) What have been the results of the new ballpark built by the taxpayers of Arlington? CNN: “Fans love the stadium. And the team has flourished financially.” (Source: CNN, &quot;Bush as businessman: How the Texas governor made his millions&quot;) (Correction on 5/19—Sosa was traded to the White Sox, not Cubs.

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Changed pollution laws for power and oil companies and made Texas the most polluted state in the Union.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Here are the facts: Texas leads the nation in reduction of toxic releases. Texas has led the nation in the reduction of toxic releases by 43 million pounds from 1995 to 1998 (during GWB’s tenure as governor). It is not the most polluted state in the nation. According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s 1998 Toxic Release Inventory (the most recent data available from the EPA, released in May 2000), Texas dropped from first to fifth place in 1998 (while GWB was still governor) for total emissions to the air, water and soil. <br>

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Replaced Los Angeles with Houston as the most smog-ridden city in America.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Houston does not lead the nation in air pollution. Los Angeles surpassed Houston in 2000 (while GWB was still governor) in ozone exceedances. Through July 17, 2000 Los Angeles exceeded the federal ozone standard on 17 days, compared to Houston’s 13 days. (Associated Press, 8/7/00). Much more on Bush’s Texas environmental record can be found at: PoliticsAndElections.com, &quot;Setting The Record Straight Gore Pollutes Governor Bush’s Environmental Record&quot; This is a Bush-Cheney press release from 2000, but much of it is corroborated by outside sources, as illustrated by the Associated Press citation above. <br>

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas government to the tune of billions in borrowed money.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> A Wall Street Journal article finds different results: “Finally, there is the question of the fiscal record of George W. Bush while he was Texas governor. Mr. Bush racked up a decent, but not a dazzling, pro-taxpayer record. He came into office promising tax cuts, tort reform, a lighter regulatory burden for business, and stringent education standards. Mr. Bush delivered on each of those promises, more or less. He signed two of the largest tax cuts in Texas history. But Mr. Bush could leave conservatives frustrated. This is a politician who seems to always want to please everyone. As the Austin Statesman wrote of Mr. Bush’s final budget: &quot;He took a $6 billion surplus, cut taxes by $1.5 billion and spent most of the rest.&quot; Still, the latest comptroller report indicates that Texas still has a $1 billion-plus budget surplus.” (WSJ, 2/12/01) September 27, 2003 Page 12 of 45<br>
 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Set record for most executions by any Governor in American history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The death penalty is law in Texas and—believe it or not—the governor does not have the power to execute people. In fact, the governor only has the power to stay an execution for 30 days. The governor is powerless in Texas to grant pardons or clemency: “Prior to a 1934 constitutional amendment, the governor had independent pardon powers. The amendment removing these powers was added after Jim and Miriam Ferguson were accused of selling clemency during her term as Governor. In modern times, governors have used what clemency powers they have been left with sparingly. As the application of the death penalty in the state has come under increasing scrutiny and criticism, and new technology has been made available to review old cases, governors have used reprieves to deflect criticism by allowing for further review of death penalty cases. These incidents have been rare, given the weak opposition to capital punishment. In cases where there is some compelling question about carrying out an execution, governors are ultimately in a safe position. Granting a thirty-day reprieve can appear judicious but not overly soft on criminals, as the governor cannot prevent an execution on his or her own. Yet in the event a mistake is found and a wrongful execution prevented, the governor is likely to appear careful and just. Still, Texas governors have granted such reprieves relatively rarely.” (“Texas Politics, The Executive Branch”, Texas Politics at The University of Texas, &quot;7. The Governor and the Judiciary&quot;) <br>

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Became president after losing the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, with the help of my father’s appointments to the Supreme Court.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The popular vote doesn’t elect the president: the Electoral College does. Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, Cornell University The Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution Incidentally, George W. Bush received more popular votes than did his father in 1992 and Bill Clinton in both his elections. In fact, you have to go back to Ronald Reagan’s landslide in 1984 to find a winning candidate with more popular votes. (Source: President Elect) Of the nine justices currently serving on the Supreme Court, two were appointed by George Bush Sr.—Clarence Thomas and David Souter. This is important, so please take note. Two appointments. (Supreme Court, &quot;Members of the Supreme Court of the United States&quot;) The “resume” says that GWB became president “with the help of my father’s appointments to the Supreme Court. “ There’s only one problem with that: President Bush the elder appointed two justices to the Supreme Court. The ruling that ended the recounts in Florida was a 7-to-2 vote. Even if President Bush’s two appointees had voted in favor the Florida Supreme Court, the vote would have still been 5-to-4. (Infoplease.com, &quot;2000 Election Chronology&quot;) To counter the critics’ claim that the US Supreme Court’s decision was “bought”, there is a 65-page opinion (and dissent) which enumerates the precedents that the Supreme Court used in making their ruling. (CNN, &quot;Supreme Court Opinion - Bush v. Gore - December 13, 2000&quot;) There’s a clarification to this issue in the “Changes” section at the beginning of the document.<br>

 Accomplishments as president <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Attacked and took over two countries.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Afghanistan’s Taliban regime was displaced by US intervention in 2002. A government led by Afghans is currently in power: CNN, &quot;Karzai elected as Afghan leader&quot; As to why we “attacked and took over” in Afghanistan, I refer you to the 2000 report by Amnesty International: “Human rights abuses by the warring factions against members of rival ethnic groups occurred throughout 1999. Taleban forces burned homes, destroyed orchards, wheat fields and irrigation systems and forcibly displaced more than 100,000 mainly Tajik people. The UN imposed financial and aviation sanctions on the Taleban for not surrendering Osama bin Laden to stand trial for his alleged involvement in US embassy bombings in August 1998. Women, children, human rights defenders, members of ethnic groups, people accused of homosexual activity, and refugees were systematically targeted by the Taleban and other warring factions on the basis of their identity. Taleban courts imposed sentences of death, amputation and flogging after apparently unfair trials.” (Source: Amnesty International) As for Iraq, we removed Saddam Hussein from power. Here are just a couple of articles detailing the abuses of his regime: Amnesty International, &quot;Annual Report 2000&quot; Sports Illustrated, &quot;Son of Saddam&quot; But the reason we gave for attacking Iraq was Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and violation of the UN resolutions 660, 678, and 1441. Here’s the evidence for that: The United States has documented violations of these UN resolutions since the end of Desert Storm in 1991. In fact, UN Ambassador Bill Richardson, of the Clinton Administration, testified in 1997 about the Iraqi non-compliance: Federation Of American Scientists, &quot;UNSCOM List Of Iraqi Weapons Violations&quot; The Bush administration laid out its case for the Iraqi invasion by detailing each UN resolution and the UN’s own conclusion that said resolutions had been violated: White House, &quot;Saddam Hussein’s Defiance of United Nations Resolutions’ September 27, 2003 Page 14 of 45<br>
 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spent the surplus and bankrupted the treasury.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> As a quick reading of the Constitution will attest, the President has no power to spend. That power lies with Congress. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Shattered record for biggest annual deficit in history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Again, spending power resides with Congress. (GWB’s deficit, when measured against GDP, is not the largest in history. More information in the “Changes” section.) <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Set economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Bankruptcies have been on the rise since 1940, with the exception of a few years. The Cato Institute statistics only show data through 1997, but the trend is clear. Cato Institute, &quot;Ballooning Bankruptcies&quot; The claim that GWB set a record for the most private bankruptcies in one year can be made about every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Look at the reasons most often cited for filing personal bankruptcies: Credit card bills 63% Lawsuit/legal bills 12% Job loss/cut in pay 50% Taxes 10% Mismanagement of personal finances 37% College expenses 8% Medical bills 28% Death in family 7% Difficulty with business 15% Gambling 2% Divorce/marital breakup 13% I don’t think anyone would argue that the increase in private bankruptcies is a good thing, but the blame cannot be laid at the feet of any president. At the same time bankruptcies have increased, so has consumer debt. Interestingly, between 1990 and 1997, credit card solicitations tripled from 1 to 3 billion per year. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Set all-time record for biggest drop in the history of the stock market.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Facts on File disagrees: “The largest stock-market drop in Wall Street history occurred on &quot;Black Monday&quot; -- October 19, 1987 -- when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508.32 points, losing 22.6% of its total value.” September 27, 2003 Page 15 of 45<br>
 <br>
If you’d like to suggest that the phrase “biggest drop” refers to a period of time and not a single day, then Bush isn’t to blame either: The Ten Worst Stock Market Crashes of All Time (as of 10/28/02) Source: About.com Date Started Date Ended Number of Days Total Loss 4/17/1930 7/8/1932 813 -86.0% 3/10/1937 3/31/1938 386 -49.1% 1/19/1906 11/15/1907 665 -48.5% 9/3/1929 11/13/1929 71 -47.9% 11/3/1919 8/24/1921 660 -46.6% 6/17/1901 11/9/1903 875 -46.1% 1/11/1973 12/06/1974 694 -45.1% 9/12/1939 4/28/1942 959 -40.4% 11/21/1916 12/19/1917 393 -40.1% 9/7/1932 2/27/1933 173 -37.2% <br>

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First president in decades to execute a federal prisoner.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The first federal prisoner “in decades” to be executed was Timothy McVeigh, who was responsible for 168 deaths at the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, including children in the building’s day care center. The federal death penalty is law. Regardless of your opinion on the death penalty, it is hard to have any sympathy for Timothy McVeigh. FYI, Bush did not actually execute the prisoner, as “the resume” implies. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First president in US history to enter office with a criminal record.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I will not dispute that President Bush was arrested in 1976 for driving under the influence. He has admitted it, though understandably he didn’t volunteer the information. For a complete story, here’s a link: CNN, &quot;Bush acknowledges 1976 DUI charge&quot; I will leave it up to the reader to determine what other presidents have had such indiscretions, yet were never caught. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First year in office set the all-time record for most days on vacation by any president in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> No proof is provided by “the resume”, and I can find none. September 27, 2003 Page 16 of 45<br>
 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>After taking the entire month of August off for vacation, presided over the worst security failure in US history in September.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Here’s a few notes on the President’s schedule for August 2001: <br>
August 1, 2001: Nominated six US Attorneys, two judges for affirmation by Congress. Placed phone calls to PM Blair and Ahern to discuss matters between Britain and Northern Ireland. President announces an agreement on the Patients Bill of Rights President addresses National Urban League Conference <br>
August 2, 2001: President meets with House and Senate education leaders. <br>
August 3, 2001: Placed six more nominations for US Attorneys. President speaks to press at meeting to discuss his first six months in office and the agenda for the future. President attends a ceremony in East Room honoring Lance Armstrong. <br>
August 4, 2001: President’s Radio Address <br>
August 7, 2001: Press conference in Waco, TX with pool of reporters. <br>
August 8, 2001: President helps build a home with Habitat For Humanity, then addresses the group on faith-based and community initiatives. <br>
August 9, 2001: Addressed the nation on stem-cell research. August 10, 2001: Announces nomination of two US Ambassadors. <br>
August 11, 2001: President’s Radio Address August 13, 2001: Presidential Ceremony to sign the Agriculture Supplemental Bill. President holds two press conferences with traveling White House pool. The rest of the month had just as much, if not more, activity. I will omit it here to save space, but you can find complete information at the following sites: White House, “News releases for August 2001” White House Press Briefing, August 1, 2001 White House Press Briefing, August 3, 2001 White House Press Briefing, August 9, 2001 White House Press Briefing, August 22, 2001 White House Press Briefing, August 31, 2001 The President was in Texas from August 7-13 and 21-25. The rest of the month was spent traveling to New Mexico, Colorado, Wisconsin, Missouri and then back to Washington at the end of the month. A review of the White House news archive for August 2001 shows this month to be anything but a “vacation”. It is naïve to think that the President spent an entire month doing nothing, as “the resume” implies. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips than any other president in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> No proof is provided by “the resume”, and I can find none. September 27, 2003 Page 17 of 45<br>
 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>In my first two years in office over 2 million Americans lost their job.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> President Bush took office in January 2001. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has data for 2001 and 2002 on their web site: Bureau of Labor Statistics Data If you assume that GWB is responsible for what happened in 2001, which I believe is a faulty assumption, then 2.5 million Americans were added to the unemployment rolls during his first two years in office. I suggest that the 2001 statistics probably should be attributed to Clinton policies, though that is a subject for some debate. Are 2.5 million jobs lost in two years unprecedented in history? Hardly. Here are some other examples of such a drop: 1954: 1.7 million added to the unemployment rolls (1.04% of the population) 1958: 1.7 million added to the unemployment rolls (.97% of the population) 1970-1971: 2.2 million added to the unemployment rolls (1.05% of the population) 1974-1975: 3.6 million added to the unemployment rolls (1.67% of the population) 1981-1982: 2.4 million added to the unemployment rolls (1.02% of the population) 1991-1992: 2.6 million added to the unemployment rolls (1.02% of the population) What’s interesting is that based on population change, the 2001-2002 job loss is only .77% of the population—significantly lower than the other six periods of evaluation. US Population Estimates Historical Population Numbers I would never argue that 2.2 million Americans losing their jobs is insignificant, but it is not unprecedented in other economic downturns in US history.<br>
<br>
 • <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Cut unemployment benefits for more out of work Americans than any president in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I have searched CNN’s database for the past three years and can find no evidence that President Bush ever cut unemployment benefits. The closest I came was this: CNN, &quot;800,000 jobless workers to lose benefits&quot; In December 2002, unemployment benefits for 800,000 Americans expired. Congress did not pass legislation that would have extended those benefits. However, two weeks earlier, the President had encouraged Congress to extend benefits: CNN, &quot;Bush wants unemployment benefits extended&quot; Benefits were lost to these 800,000 workers on December 28 and Congress passed legislation on January 8 to renew benefits to these workers. President Bush signed the bill immediately. September 27, 2003 Page 18 of 45<br>
 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Unfortunately, foreclosures have been on the rise since at least 1980. According to Mr. Irv Ackelsberg, Managing Attorney of Community Legal Services, Inc: “Between 1980 and 1999 both the number and the rate of home foreclosures in the United States have skyrocketed. The absolute number of foreclosures rose 277%. This means that although this was a period of economic prosperity, almost four times the number of homes were foreclosed upon in 1999 as in 1980.” Mr. Ackelsberg testified before Congress in 2001 and cited four reasons for the increased number of foreclosures: • the deregulation of home lending laws; • the limitation of tax deductibility of consumer debt to home secured loans; • the increases in real estate values which has expanded availability of home equity for many households; and • the proliferation of mortgage brokers. Mr. Ackelsberg’s report to the Senate Banking committee can be found online: U.S. Senate, &quot;Hearing on &quot;Predatory Mortgage Lending: The Problem, Impact and Responses.&quot; To emphasize one important point of the above quote, I will repeat it here: “This means that although this was a period of economic prosperity, almost four times the number of homes were foreclosed upon in 1999 as in 1980.” There does not appear to be a direct correlation between economic prosperity and foreclosures, nor between presidential policies and foreclosures. I would never diminish the effect of foreclosures on individuals, but to pin this one on Mr. Bush ignores the evidence. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Appointed more convicted criminals to administration positions than any president in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> There’s no evidence provided here for this claim and I can find none on my own. I did, however, find statistics on Mr. Bush’s predecessor, Bill Clinton: Number of individuals and businesses associated with the Clinton Administration who have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to crimes 47 Number of these convictions during Clinton’s presidency 33 Number of indictments/misdemeanor charges 61 Number of imprisonments 14 Number of congressional witnesses who have pled the 5th Amendment, fled the country to avoid testifying, or (in the case of foreign witnesses refused to be interviewed) as of 9/99) 122 Source: TheVRWC.org September 27, 2003 Page 19 of 45<br>
 <br>
I know that this does not refute the argument that “the resume” makes. However, since they felt no need to prove their claim, I didn’t feel the need to help them. What is clear is that the Bush administration has quite a way to go in order to surpass the Clinton record. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Set the record for the least amount of press conferences than any president since the advent of television.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> According to a study done by Richard Strout in 1966 (reprinted in Nieman Reports): Roosevelt had just under 1,000 conferences. Mr. Truman, if my figures are right, had well over 300; General Eisenhower cut the number down to 200, and President Kennedy in his bright 1,000 days had a conference about once a fortnight. Alas, this tradition has not continued in recent days. President Johnson has been one of the most accessible men to the press of any President, that is, in informal gatherings, meetings with individual bureau chiefs, or tips to favorite correspondents. But as for formal press conferences, I can only figure that he had nine last year. So far in 1966 he has held only a few. Strout criticizes LBJ for not having more press conferences, so the criticism of Bush is nothing new. However, the point that GWB has held fewer press conferences than other presidents is valid. Here are the numbers, researched by Martha Joynt Kumar, a Towson University political science professor who specializes in presidential communication: “At the same point in their presidencies, President Bill Clinton had held 30 solo news conferences (that is, without a foreign leader at a twin lectern) and Bush’s father had held 58, according to research by Martha Joynt Kumar, a Towson University political science professor who specializes in presidential communication. After two years and 45 days in office, President Ronald Reagan had held 16 solo news conferences, President Jimmy Carter had held 45, President Gerald Ford had held 37, President Richard M. Nixon had held 16 and President Lyndon B. Johnson had held 52.” (Quote from “Bush’s Distaste for News Conferences Keeps Them Rare” by Mike Allen, Washington Post, March 7, 2003) As of March 7, 2003, GWB had held 8 formal press conferences. So while it is true that he has held fewer than any other modern president, the numbers are not so vastly different. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Signed more laws and executive orders amending the Constitution than any president in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> President Bush has not signed any laws amending the US Constitution. Only Congress can pass a law amending the Constitution and they have not done so since 1978. (Source: The United States Constitution Online) (There is a second method of amending the Constitution cited in Article V of the Constitution. See “Changes” for more information.) September 27, 2003 Page 20 of 45<br>
 <br>
As to Executive Orders, Bush isn’t even close to signing “more…than any president in US history: (Source: List of Executive Orders at the National Archives) President Number of Orders SignedYears in Office Orders Per Year GWB 99 2 50 Clinton 363 8 45 Bush 165 4 41 Reagan 380 8 48 Carter 319 4 80 Ford 168 2 84 Nixon 345 6 58 Johnson 323 5 65 Kennedy 213 3 71 A quick glance of the Executive Orders of George W Bush at will reveal their sinister nature: “Increasing Participation of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Federal Programs” (Executive Order 13125) “Prohibition of Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor” (Executive Order 13126) “Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With the Taliban” (Executive Order 13129) Just to clarify one point: there seems to be a suggestion that Executive Orders are some sort of secret, evil machination of presidents. Not so: every Executive Order is available for review on the government’s own web site: Federal Register, &quot;Executive Orders Disposition Tables January 8, 1937 – August 28, 2003&quot; <br>

Presidential Press Conference, March 29, 2001 &quot;Remarks by the President in Question and Answer Session with the Press&quot;, January 29, 2001 Finally, the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by “past presidents” is somewhat fallacious. Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat from New York, urged President Clinton to use oil from the SPR to stem a crisis in 2000. “Schumer said presidents have exercised the power at least three times in the past -- twice simply to boost federal revenue to help balance the budget.” So the claim that past presidents have used the SPR to relieve high gasoline prices, as the “resume” clearly implies, is fallacious as well.

The State Department’s web site lists 500 pages of treaties currently in force: State Department, &quot;A List of Treaties and Other International Agreements...&quot; If anyone wants to do the research, go at it. “The resume” offered no proof and I found none. (I have been informed by a number of people that GWB withdrew from the ABM Treaty. Information on this and much more is available in the “Changes” section.) <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>My presidency is the most secretive and un-accountable of any in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> How do you go about arguing this? With no evidence cited, I can’t refute it. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (the ’poorest’ multi-millionaire, Condoleeza Rice has an Exxon oil tanker named after her). Yes, this one’s true. Bush has 13 millionaires in his Cabinet (out of 16 secretaries), while Clinton had 7 and Bush Sr. had 6: Asheville Global Report, &quot;Multi-millionaires make Bush’s team richest in history&quot; And the “oil tanker” story? True, except it’s Chevron, not Exxon. (Source: Multinational Monitor web site) Now, the question is this: why is being rich a crime? Why is it wrong to have rich people in your Cabinet? Generally speaking, people who are qualified to serve in positions such as Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State are people who have done well in their field. People who are successful generally make more money. September 27, 2003 Page 23 of 45<br>

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud of any market in any country in the history of the world.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> “Presiding” is what a “President” does. In that sense, he was in office while fraud occurred, but no serious claim has been made that he had any hand in it. It’s kind of like saying “President Carter presided over the Olympic Hockey team’s gold medal in 1980.” No one seriously thinks he had anything to do with it. (Most of the stock market fraud that has been alleged – Worldcom, Global Crossing, Enron – was actually committed in the period before GWB took office. See “Changes” for details.) <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Created the largest government department bureaucracy in the history of the United States.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I suspect we’re talking here about the Department of Homeland Security, which was created in 2003 and combines the work of the Secret Service, Coast Guard, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Customs Service and the Transportation Security Administration. The Associated Press refers to the creation of the department as the ”the largest government reorganization since the Defense Department was created in 1947.” Since this agency combines the work of already existing agencies and consolidates efforts, I’m not sure how this could be a bad thing, but I’ll leave that up to you to decide.

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more than any president in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Time to cite directly from the Constitution: “The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States…” (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 – Source: US House web site) There’s a great summary of the US Budget Process on the House’s web site: Us House Of Representatives, &quot;The Annual Budget Process&quot; In a nutshell, the President is not required to submit a budget, but normally does. It is considered a starting point for the Congressional Budget, which is eventually passed and sent on to the President for his signature. To reiterate, the President does not spend the money – Congress does. September 27, 2003 Page 24 of 45<br>
 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the human rights commission.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> On May 4, 2001, the United States was voted off of the UN Human Rights commission. Why? From GlobalPolicy.org’s reporting on the vote: “Amnesty International USA called the removal of the United States from the commission &quot;part of an effort by nations that routinely violate human rights to escape scrutiny.&quot; Amnesty accused members of commission of failing to do their job, succumbing instead to political and economic pressures. &quot;The U.S. was among the few nations willing to actively push for condemnation at the U.N.H.R.C. of the brutal human rights violations committed by nations like China,&quot; it said. At Human Rights Watch, Joanna Weschler, the group’s representative at the United Nations, said the commission was becoming &quot;a rogues’ gallery of human rights abusers.&quot; But she added: &quot;It wasn’t just enemies. It was friends as well who voted the U.S. out of the commission.&quot; Friends of the United States in Europe and elsewhere have grown increasingly impatient, disappointed and annoyed with actions by Washington.” More information from the group Human Rights Watch can be found at: Human Rights Watch, &quot;U.N. Rights Body Admits Abusive Members&quot; Human Rights Watch, &quot;UN News Summary&quot; It should be noted that the current members include Cuba, Sudan, and China: nations that routinely kill political prisoners and suppress human rights. A complete list of the UN Human Rights Commission can be found at: United Nations, &quot;Membership of the Commission on Human Rights&quot; The United States is once again a member of the Commission. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the elections monitoring board.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> First, the United Nations doesn’t have an “elections monitoring board”; however, they do have an “Electoral Assistance Division”. Here’s the web site: United Nations, &quot;United Nations Electoral Assistance: A System-Wide Endeavor&quot; Second, the UN doesn’t appear to have a committee or board that is comprised by nations, such as the Security Council or Human Rights Commission. Instead they have a “roster of experts” which assists in election monitoring worldwide. Finally, I can’t find any evidence that the UN removed the US from anything having to do with election monitoring over the last three years. If anyone knows what the “resume” refers to on this point, please let me know. September 27, 2003 Page 25 of 45<br>
 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Removed more checks and balances, and have the least amount of congressional oversight than any presidential administration in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> No evidence is cited for this, so I’m not sure what they’re referring to. I could find no evidence of the dissolution of any Congressional committees of oversight, so I’m not sure what to argue. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Withdrew from the World Court of Law.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> There is no such thing as the “World Court of Law.” There is a body popularly known as the “World Court”, though its official name is the Permanent Court of International Justice. According to the Columbia Encyclopedia, the United States was never a member of the World Court, because the Senate refused to ratify the protocol: The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001, &quot;World Court&quot; (Correction: The International Court of Justice is the body that currently exists and was formed from the old Permanent Court of International Justice in 1945. We were not members of the original court, but are members of the new court by virtue of our membership in the United Nations.) More information is available in the “Changes” section. What the Bush Administration did do, however, is remove the United States from an agreement to establish an International Criminal Court: BBC News, &quot;US renounces world court treaty&quot; Incidentally, as of May 6, 2002, when the United States removed itself from the agreement, here are some of the other nations that refused entry into the new court: China, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iraq, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Israel and Russia. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Refused to allow inspectors access to US prisoners of war and by default no longer abide by the Geneva Conventions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This is blatantly false. Red Cross officials have reviewed the conditions at Guantanamo Bay, where the Afghan detainees are being held, as well as the conditions of the Iraqi POWs. CNN has written a story addressing the Geneva Convention and its salient points: CNN, &quot;What’s fair in war?&quot; There are two issues raised by the CNN piece: o No hearings have been held to establish the status of the 23,000 (corrected: 650) detainees at Guantanamo (Corrected on 5/6, see “Changes” section for more info.) o The reporters “embedded” with the military showed some Iraqi captives on television. However, no one has seriously suggested mistreatment of those held by the United States, nor has anyone seriously accused the US of abandoning the Geneva Conventions.

 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First president in US history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 US elections).</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Try as I might, I could not find evidence of this anywhere. I’d be happy to hear from anyone who can provide documentation on it. (Russia and Albania – not the UN – sent election inspectors to monitor the 2002 elections and it does not appear that they were denied access by GWB. See the “Changes” section for more information.) <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>All-time US (and world) record holder for most corporate campaign donations.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Certainly GWB had more campaign money to spend in 2000 than did Al Gore. According to PoliticalMoneyLine.com, GWB had approximately $200 million to spend, whereas Gore collected $140 million. Interestingly, if you look at the breakdown of the two candidates, the difference lies in “individual contributions”, not in corporate/PAC/labor union money. This page at the Federal Election Commission following page provides a very interesting breakdown of money contributed by various industries to both political parties from 1991 forward: PAC Hard Dollar Contributions Made By Industry Groupings (1991-2003) While the GOP leads in most industries, the Democratic Party collected nearly $50 million dollars from labor unions. So “the resume” is very cunning in specifying only “corporate campaign donations”. If you add in labor unions (and Buddhist monks), the numbers tell a very different story. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>My biggest lifetime campaign contributor presided over one of the largest corporate bankruptcy frauds in world history (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation).</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Not quite sure how to approach this one, since numbers would be very difficult to locate. We can establish this: Enron was an energy trading company; however, the largest corporate/PAC contributors to Bush’s 2000 campaign were Finance/Insurance and single-issue groups: Federal Election Commission Breakdown of Bush 2000 Contributors According to OpenSecrets.org, Kenneth Lay contributed only $75,000 to the Bush gubernatorial campaigns in 1994 and 1998: George W. Bush Texas Governor’s Race Contributions at OpenSecrets.org (Just in case you think Lay contributed to Bush through Enron itself, please note: In Texas, corporations and labor unions are prohibited from making direct contributions to candidates, but may make unlimited contributions to political parties up to 60 days before the election.)

 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in US history</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Unfortunately for the “resume”, this is another falsehood. President Bush, by even the largest estimates, spent about 1 million dollars in his first year in office on pollsters and focus groups. President Clinton spent 2 million. The source? None other than Bush-basher extraordinaire, Maureen Dowd:  “In the new Washington Monthly, Joshua Green reveals the extent of Bush polling: Republican records show that &quot;Bush’s principal pollsters received $346,000 in direct payments in 2001. Add to that the multiple boutique polling firms the administration regularly employs for specialized and targeted polls and the figure is closer to $1 million.&quot; (That’s about half as much as Mr. Clinton spent his first year, but about $1 million more than Mr. Bush led us to expect he’d spend.)” (Source: “Addiction to Addition”, New York Times, April 3, 2002) <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First president in US history to unilaterally attack a sovereign nation against the will of the United Nations and the world community.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I earlier outlined the reasons we attacked Iraq and Afghanistan. Please refer to that section for more information. I would add this opinion: Just because the UN and “world community” is against your actions don’t make those actions wrong. Incidentally, we went into Iraq with the second-largest coalition of nations since WWII: Afghanistan, Albania, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom and Uzbekistan. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First president to run and hide when the US came under attack on September 11th (and then lied saying the enemy had the code to Air Force 1)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Since there was only one president “when the US came under attack on September 11th”, this is kind of an odd assertion. Secondly, it only makes sense when there are multiple attacks being carried out on the United States simultaneously that the president would not present himself as an open target. Third, I suspect that it was the military and secret service that suggested the president “run and hide”, rather than the President himself. President Bush’s first step on 9/11 was to travel to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. Since the United States was on nuclear alert, transporting the President to an Air Force base is not an unusual step. President Bush’s second trip on 9/11 was to Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, at that time the home of the Strategic Air Command—again a quite logical step considering that we didn’t know what other attacks would take place on that day. By 7:00PM that night, the President was back in Washington. (Clarification on 5/6, see “Changes” for info.) (Source: Infoplease.com) September 27, 2003 Page 28 of 45<br>
 <br>
Interestingly, only evidence of the “lie” that “the enemy had the code to Air Force 1[sic]” is from William Safire’s column on September 13, 2001 entitled “Inside the Bunker”. Mr. Safire quoted a “high White House official&quot; who told him &quot;A threatening message received by the Secret Service was relayed to the agents with the president that ’Air Force One is next.’&quot; Safire continued: &quot;According to the high official, American code words were used showing a knowledge of procedures that made the threat credible.&quot; It is a far stretch indeed to then claim that Mr. Bush himself made the claim. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First US president to establish a secret shadow government.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I can’t say whether or not GWB was the first to establish a secret shadow government (after all, it is secret), but here the Washington Post article outlining the reasons: &quot;Shadow Government Is at Work in Secret&quot;, Washington Post, March 1, 2002 The Post article documents the plan for “continuity of government”, which was first outlined under President Reagan. It’s important to note that the need for a continuity plan is real: should a rogue nation or terrorist group attempt to decapitate the American government, a contingency plan must be in place. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Took the biggest world sympathy for the US after 9/11, and in less than a year made the US the most resented country in the world (possibly the biggest diplomatic failure in US and world history).</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I’m not sure how you’d even measure the “most resented country in the world”. (Is it a Gallup Poll or something?) Furthermore, I can think of a few “diplomatic failures” in world history that are a little more egregious than what’s happened in Iraq. (If you can even call that a diplomatic failure.) Off the top of my head, I’d say that WWI and WWII were probably a little worse. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>With a policy of ’disengagement’ created the most hostile Israeli-Palestine relations in at least 30 years.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Again, history bears out that relations at times have been worse between the Israelis and Palestinians than they are right now. Here are a few examples from MidEastWeb.org: Oct. 6, 1973 Yom Kippur War (October War). In a surprise attack on the Jewish Day of Atonement, Egypt retook the Suez canal and a narrow zone on the other side. Syria reconquered the Golan Heights. Following massive US and Soviet resupplying of the sides, Israel succeeded in pushing back the Syrians and threatening Damascus. Ariel Sharon crossed the Suez Canal and cut off the Egyptian Third Army. September 27, 2003 Page 29 of 45<br>
 <br>
June 6, 1982 Massive Israeli invasion of Lebanon to fight PLO. UN Security Council Resolution 509 demands that Israel withdraw all its military forces forthwith, but Israel advances rapidly to Beirut, surrounding the capital by 13 Jun. Israeli cabinet is split on the sudden expansion of the war, beyond the 40 KM limit originally declared by Sharon. Sept. 28, 2000 Palestinians initiated riots after Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount, which is also the location of the Haram as Sharif holy to Muslims. Violence was apparently encouraged by Fatah Tanzim, as admitted by Marwan Barghouhi. Violence escalated rapidly from rock throwing to machine gun and mortar fire, suicide bombings and lethal road ambushes, including some incidents instigated by settlers against Palestinians. Israelis killed 15 Israeli Arabs in riots in September/October 2000, and over 2,000 Palestinians in retaliatory raids thereafter. Palestinians kill over 700 Israelis. Violence continues for over a year [to present - March 2003]. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First US president in history to have a majority of the people of Europe (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and stability.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Again, I’d suggest that when you’re sure that what you’re doing is right, it doesn’t matter who protests. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First US president in history to have the people of South Korea more threatened by the US than their immediate neighbor, North Korea.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> If I read this correct, this means that the United States is more of a threat to South Korea than is North Korea. Again, I’m not sure how this is measured, but I’ll try to present some evidence myself. Here’s a Harris poll taken among the Japanese and South Koreans regarding the US action post-9/11: Harris Poll #64, &quot;How the Japanese, South Koreans and Chinese View the Post 9/11 World and U.S. Military Action&quot; There was a report done by Gallup Korea in December 2002, which does appear to bear out “the résumé’s” allegation: &quot;South Koreans Perceive Cold War Enemies Better Than Cold War Allies&quot; So I don’t quite know what to make of this one. I would say this: The Bush administration is probably not so much concerned about relations between North and South Korea as they are about the North’s possession of nuclear weapons and their stated intention to use them. (Some clarification on the North Korea-South Korea issue is available in the “Changes” section.) September 27, 2003 Page 30 of 45<br>
 <br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Changed US policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I haven’t been able to find any evidence of this. I searched CNN’s database, but didn’t come up with anything close. Since pleading guilty to a speeding ticket would make one a “convicted criminal”, I’m kid of skeptical that there was such a policy in the first place. If anyone can find any details on this, please let me know. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Set all-time record for number of administration appointees who violated US law by not selling huge investments in corporations bidding for government contracts.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> “The resume” provided no evidence for this. I searched CNN and couldn’t find any evidence. You’d think if they set an “all-time record”, there’d be more proof of it, but I couldn’t find any. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Failed to fulfill my pledge to get Osama Bin Laden ’dead or alive’.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> We still have troops on the ground in Afghanistan and Osama certainly does appear to be a sneaky SOB, but we have hardly “failed”. We haven’t given up. (See answer to next question for more information.) <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Failed to capture the anthrax killer who tried to murder the leaders of our country at the United States Capital building. After 18 months I have no leads and zero suspects.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The Department of Justice/FBI investigation continues. If you’re interested to know what’s going on, please refer to: FBI Website -- &quot;Amerithrax Links&quot; How “the resume” knows that there are no suspects is a mystery. Attorney General Ashcroft has named one person a “person of interest”, though no action has been taken. What’s curious about this claim and the previous one is this: Criminals, such as the anthrax killer and Osama Bin Laden, don’t want to get caught. Therefore, they do their evil deeds out of plain sight. It took the FBI nearly twenty years to catch the Unabomber. Eric Rudolph, the abortion clinic bomber, has been on the lam for over 5 years now. (Update: Rudolph was captured on May 31, 2003.) <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>In the 18 months following the 9/11 attacks I have successfully prevented any public investigation into the biggest security failure in the history of the United States</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. On the contrary, as early as June 2002 there were congressional hearings on the September 11 disaster: (The sessions were “closed-door”, but they were public, bipartisan investigations.) CNN, &quot;Lawmakers promise ’fact-driven’ 9/11 probe” There was indeed opposition from the Bush administration: CNN, “Rice opposes public panel to probe 9/11” September 27, 2003 Page 31 of 45<br>
 <br>
By September 2002 (well within the “18 months” cited by “the resume”), the President agreed that an independent probe needed to occur: CNN, “Bush accepts independent but ’focused’ 9/11 probe” Note that Congress couldn’t get its act together and the commission wasn’t actually formed until November 2002: CNN, “WH blamed for failed deal on 9/11 panel” <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any other president in US history.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> How do you measure this? Again, no proof is given, so it’s hard to research. I will say this: Since September 11, security measures have been implemented that probably have curtailed freedoms and civil liberties to some extent. But I’m not sure how to prove or disprove this point. (President Lincoln suspended habeas corpus for all US citizens in 1861 (until 1866) and President Adams passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which allowed the government to arrest US citizens who wrote or spoke against the government. Both of these actions rise above the level of the Patriot Act. More information in the “Changes” section.) • In a little over two years created the most divided country in decades, possibly the most divided the US has ever been since the civil war. I would suggest that 1968 was probably a little more contentious than 2001-2003. Here’s a great web site devoted to the events of that year, compiled by Brown University: &quot;The Whole World Was Watching: an oral history of 1968&quot; at Brown University Let’s look at a few events from that year: • Martin Luther King Jr. is assassinated: “his death sparks rioting in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, Newark, Washington, D.C., and many others. Across the country 46 deaths will be blamed on the riots” • Riots in the streets at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. • Vietnam war rages: US troops kill 500 women and children at My Lai I’d like to think that we have an appreciation of our history as American citizens. If anyone seriously thinks that the few protests over the Iraq war rival anything that happened in 1968, I may need to reconsider that opinion. September 27, 2003 Page 32 of 45<br>

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Entered office with the strongest economy in US history and in less than two years turned every single economic category heading straight down.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> As the economy is a cyclical beast, some presidents are blessed with a good economy, while others are not. The financial policies of any president do not impact the economy immediately; therefore, I’d argue that President Clinton had something to do with the problems we’re seeing today, just as Bush Sr. deserves some credit for the good economy during the 1990s. But, if you’re going to pin the economy solely on Bush, at least look at the numbers: (Source: EconStats: Inflation, Unemployment and Labor) • President Bush took office with a 3.8% inflation rate. It fell every quarter between Q1 2001 and Q1 2003. This most recent quarter it is back to 3.8%. • Average hourly earnings have risen every quarter that GWB has been in office. • Unemployment has risen for 8 of the 10 quarters that President Bush has been in office, but is still 1.5% lower than during the 1991-1993 recession. Unemployment numbers actually began to turn during President Clinton’s last year in office. (Scott Jordan has done some detailed research showing that most every economic indicator was on the way down before GWB entered office. Robert Novak has written a column detailing the Democratic manipulation of the numbers during the election year 2000. More information is available in the “Changes” section.) Records and References <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>At least one conviction for drunk driving in Maine (Texas driving record has been erased and is not available)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The President himself, as I mentioned earlier, has confirmed the first claim. Some evidence for the second claim is that when he became Governor, Mr. Bush received a new driver’s license with a new number. I can find no evidence that the original record was erased. <br>
<br>
• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>AWOL from National Guard and Deserted the military during a time of war.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Originally, I cited an article from Cecil Adams’ “The Straight Dope” column with his version of the Bush AWOL story. I am pulling that in favor of an article from George magazine. It’s a long article, but seems to be the most detailed account. The Real Military Record of George W. Bush: Not Heroic, but Not AWOL, Either By Peter Keating and Karthik Thyagarajan  For more than a year, controversy about George W. Bush’s Air National Guard record has bubbled through the press. Interest in the topic has spiked in recent days, as at least two websites have launched stories essentially calling Bush AWOL in 1972 and 1973. For example, in &quot;Finally, the Truth about Bush’s Military Record&quot; on TomPaine.com, Marty Heldt writes, &quot;Bush’s long absence from the records comes to an end one week after he failed to comply with an order to attend ’Annual Active Duty Training’ starting at the end of May 1973... Nothing indicates in the records that he ever made up the time he missed.&quot; And in “Bush’s Military Record Reveals Grounding and Absence for Two Full Years&quot; on Democrats.com, Robert A. Rogers states: &quot;Bush never actually reported in person for the last two years of his service - in direct violation of two separate written orders.&quot; September 27, 2003 Page 33 of 45<br>
 <br>
Neither is correct. It’s time to set the record straight. The following analysis, which relies on National Guard documents, extensive interviews with military officials and previously unpublished evidence of Bush’s whereabouts in the summer and fall of 1972, is the first full chronology of Bush’s military record. Its basic conclusions: Bush may have received favorable treatment to get into the Guard, served irregularly after the spring of 1972 and got an expedited discharge, but he did accumulate the days of service required of him for his ultimate honorable discharge. At the Republican convention in Philadelphia, George W. Bush declared: &quot;Our military is low on parts, pay and morale. If called on by the commander-in-chief today, two entire divisions of the Army would have to report, ’Not ready for duty, sir.’&quot; Bush says he is the candidate who can &quot;rebuild our military and prepare our armed forces for the future.&quot; On what direct military experience does he make such claims? George W. Bush applied to join the Texas Air National Guard on May 27, 1968, less than two weeks before he graduated from Yale University. The country was at war in Vietnam, and at that time, just months after the bloody Tet Offensive, an estimated 100,000 Americans were on waiting lists to join Guard units across the country. Bush was sworn in on the day he applied. Ben Barnes, former speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, stated in September 1999 that in late 1967 or early 1968, he asked a senior official in the Texas Air National Guard to help Bush get into the Guard as a pilot. Barnes said he did so at the behest of Sidney Adger, a Houston businessman and friend of former President George H. W. Bush, then a Texas congressman. Despite Barnes’s admission, former President Bush has denied pulling strings for his son, and retired Colonel Walter Staudt, George W. Bush’s first commander, insists: &quot;There was no special treatment.&quot; The younger Bush fulfilled two years of active duty and completed pilot training in June 1970. During that time and in the two years that followed, Bush flew the F-102, an interceptor jet equipped with heat-seeking missiles that could shoot down enemy planes. His commanding officers and peers regarded Bush as a competent pilot and enthusiastic Guard member. In March 1970, the Texas Air National Guard issued a press release trumpeting his performance: &quot;Lt. Bush recently became the first Houston pilot to be trained by the 147th [Fighter Group] and to solo in the F-102... Lt. Bush said his father was just as excited and enthusiastic about his solo flight as he was.&quot; In Bush’s evaluation for the period May 1, 1971 through April 30, 1972, then-Colonel Bobby Hodges, his commanding officer, stated, &quot;I have personally observed his participation, and without exception, his performance has been noteworthy.&quot; In the spring of 1972, however, National Guard records show a sudden dropoff in Bush’s military activity. Though trained as a pilot at considerable government expense, Bush stopped flying in April 1972 and never flew for the Guard again. Around that time, Bush decided to go to work for Winton &quot;Red&quot; Blount, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate, in Alabama. Documents from Ellington Air Force Base in Houston state that Bush &quot;cleared this base on 15 May.&quot; Shortly afterward, he applied for assignment to the 9921st Air Reserve Squadron in Montgomery, Ala., a unit that required minimal duty and offered no pay. Although that unit’s commander was willing to welcome him, on May 31 higher-ups at the Air Reserve Personnel Center in Denver rejected Bush’s request to serve at the 9921st, because it did not offer duty equivalent to his service in Texas. &quot;[A]n obligated Reservist [in this case, Bush] can be assigned to a specific Ready Reserve position only,&quot; noted the disapproval memo, a copy of which was sent to Bush. &quot;Therefore, he is ineligible for assignment to an Air Reserve Squadron.&quot; Despite the military’s decision, Bush moved to Alabama. Records obtained by Georegemag.com show that the Blount Senate campaign paid Bush about $900 a month from mid-May through mid-November to do advance work and organize events. Neither Bush’s annual evaluation nor the Air National Guard’s overall chronological listing of his service contain any evidence that he performed Guard duties during that summer. On or around his 27th birthday, July 6, 1972, Bush did not take his required annual medical exam at his Texas unit. As a consequence, he was suspended from flying military jets. Bush spokesperson Dan Bartlett told Georgemag.com: &quot;You take that exam because you are flying, and he was not flying. The paperwork uses the phrase ’suspended from flying,’ but he had no intention of flying at that time.&quot; September 27, 2003 Page 34 of 45<br>
 <br>
Some media reports have speculated that Bush took and failed his physical, or that he was grounded as a result of substance abuse. Bush’s vagueness on the subject of his past drug use has only abetted such rumors. Bush’s commanding officer in Texas, however, denies the charges. &quot;His flying status was suspended because he didn’t take the exam,not because he couldn’t pass,&quot; says Hodges. Asked whether Bush was ever disciplined for using alcohol or illicit drugs, Hodges replied: &quot;No.&quot; On September 5, Bush wrote to then-Colonel Jerry Killian at his original unit in Texas, requesting permission to serve with the 187th Tactical Reconnaisance Group, another Alabama-based unit. &quot;This duty would be for the months of September, October, and November,&quot; wrote Bush. This time his request was approved: 10 days later, the Alabama Guard ordered Bush to report to then-Lieutenant Colonel William Turnipseed at Dannelly Air Force Base in Montgomery on October 7th and 8th. The memo noted that &quot;Lieutenant Bush will not be able to satisfy his flight requirements with our group,&quot; since the 187th did not fly F-102s. The question of whether Bush ever actually served in Alabama has become an issue in the 2000 campaign-the Air Force Times recently reported that &quot;the GOP is trying to locate people who served with Bush in late 1972 ... to see if they can confirm that Bush briefly served with the Alabama Air National Guard.&quot; Bush’s records contain no evidence that he reported to Dannelly in October. And in telephone interviews with Georgemag.com, neither Turnipseed, Bush’s commanding officer, nor Kenneth Lott, then chief personnel officer of the 187th, remembered Bush serving with their unit. &quot;I don’t think he showed up,&quot; Turnipseed said. Bush maintains he did serve in Alabama. &quot;Governor Bush specifically remembers pulling duty in Montgomery and respectfully disagrees with the Colonel,&quot; says Bartlett. &quot;There’s no question it wasn’t memorable, because he wasn’t flying.&quot; In July, the Decatur Daily reported that two former Blount campaign workers recall Bush serving in the Alabama Air National Guard in the fall of 1972. &quot;I remember he actually came back to Alabama for about a week to 10 days several weeks after the campaign was over to complete his Guard duty in the state,&quot; stated Emily Martin, a former Alabama resident who said she dated Bush during the time he spent in that state. After the 1972 election, which Blount lost, Bush moved back to Houston and subsequently began working at P.U.L.L., a community service center for disadvantaged youths. This period of time has also become a matter of controversy, because even though Bush’s original unit had been placed on alert duty in October 1972, his superiors in Texas lost track of his whereabouts. On May 2, 1973, Bush’s squadron leader in the 147th, Lieutenant Colonel William Harris, Jr. wrote: &quot;Lt. Bush has not been observed at this unit&quot; for the past year. Harris incorrectly assumed that Bush had been reporting for duty in Alabama all along. He wrote that Bush &quot;has been performing equivalent training in a non-flying status with the 187 Tac Recon Gp, Dannelly ANG Base, Alabama.&quot; Base commander Hodges says of Bush’s return to Texas: &quot;All I remember is someone saying he came back and made up his days.&quot; Two documents obtained by Georgemag.com indicate that Bush did make up the time he missed during the summer and autumn of 1972. One is an April 23, 1973 order for Bush to report to annual active duty training the following month; the other is an Air National Guard statement of days served by Bush that is torn and undated but contains entries that correspond to the first. Taken together, they appear to establish that Bush reported for duty on nine occasions between November 29, 1972-when he could have been in Alabama-and May 24, 1973. Bush still wasn’t flying, but over this span, he did earn nine points of National Guard service from days of active duty and 32 from inactive duty. When added to the 15 so-called &quot;gratuitous&quot; points that every member of the Guard got per year, Bush accumulated 56 points, more than the 50 that he needed by the end of May 1973 to maintain his standing as a Guardsman. On May 1, Bush was ordered to report for further active duty training, and documents show that he proceeded to cram in another 10 sessions over the next two months. Ultimately, he racked up 19 active duty points of service and 16 inactive duty points by July 30-which, added to his 15 gratuitous points, achieved the requisite total of 50 for the year ending in May 1974. On October 1, 1973, First Lieutenant George W. Bush received an early honorable discharge so that he could attend Harvard Business School. He was credited with five years, four months and five days of service toward his six-year service obligation. I have received e-mails from several members of the military explaining some of the more obscure military jargon (such as “not observed”). See the “Changes” section for more details.<br>

He has since quit drinking and from all reports, he is in excellent physical condition. Contrary to the claims of “the resume”, Mr. Bush did answer questions during the presidential campaign about rumors of past drug use. Bush denies using any illegal drug during the past 25 years (CNN) I’ll leave it up to you to determine whether a presidential candidate should submit to a drug test. <br>

• <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>All records of any SEC investigations into my insider trading or bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and un-available for public view.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I cannot find any evidence that these records have been “sealed in secrecy”. The SEC has released some documents pertaining to the Harken investigation. I cannot find any reference to the investigation on the SEC website, but the search engine does not appear to cover documents prior to 1998. Alexander’s Gas and Oil Connections, described on their website as “a site for the gas, oil and affiliated industry giving an overview of the trends and happenings in and around the global energy-value chain”, refers to “The internal corporate documents, released by the Securities and Exchange Commission”. So there is some evidence that documents do exist and are not sealed. Here’s the story from Alexander’s: September 27, 2003 Page 36 of 45<br>
 <br>
Records reveal Bush sold Harken Energy’s stock during cash ’crisis’  07-09-00 Before selling his stock in a Texas oil company, a transaction that prompted an insider trading inquiry, George W. Bush was informed as a company director that the firm was suffering a cash ’crisis,’ newly released records show. The internal corporate documents, released by the Securities and Exchange Commission, provide the most detailed view yet of Bush’s knowledge of Harken Energy’s financial problems when he sold his shares for $ 848,560 in June 1990. Bush’s lawyer said the information, while new to the presidential campaign, was provided to the SEC as part of its investigation a decade ago and contributed to the agency’s finding that Bush’s trading was appropriate. &quot;The SEC did their job by the book, and this is old news,&quot; attorney Robert Jordan said. The Bush lawyer added that &quot;the company’s financial situation was well-disclosed to the public&quot; through filings at the time with the SEC. &quot;By the time Bush sold his stock, the cash crisis had been largely resolved,&quot; said Jordan. &quot;By May 21, 1990, the major shareholders had agreed to a credit agreement which put $ 26 mm into the company immediately.&quot; Insider trading allegations have been an issue in both Bush’s run for governor in Texas and his presidential bid. The SEC in the last month released several hundred pages of corporate documents from its investigation under the Freedom of Information Act. Bush has said he had no knowledge the Texas-based company was going to report a $ 23 mm loss two months after he sold his stock. &quot;I absolutely had no idea and would not have sold it had I known,&quot; he said during his 1994 campaign for governor. SEC investigators concurred there was no evidence Bush knew that the loss would be of that magnitude. At most, the investigators found, Bush was aware of a projected $ 4 mm loss, which was &quot;consistent with Harken’s publicly reported trend&quot; of losses, states an SEC investigative document obtained by AP. The same document projecting the $ 4 mm loss, Jordan noted, projected a profit for the fourth quarter. Bush sold his stock at $ 4 a share and by the end of that year, its value had sunk to slightly over $ 1. It returned to the $ 4 level and above in 1991. The Harken documents released under FOIA detail Bush’s knowledge of the company’s problems. As a Harken director, he received memos in spring 1990 that referred in stark terms to the company’s cash-strapped condition as banks demanded it pay down its debts. One document said the company was in the midst of a &quot;liquidity crisis&quot; and another told Bush the company was &quot;in a state of non-compliance&quot; with its lenders. Bush also was informed that a company plan to make a public stock offering to generate cash was being abandoned because one of its lenders objected. Bush served on three committees inside the company and also was paid as a consultant. Even after his stock sale, Bush remained on the company’s board of directors until 1993. I wish I could be more specific on where to find these documents, but I did find one corroborating source to show they are not “sealed in secrecy”. <br>

He had so many black ops ordered (these are presidential orders not CIA, NSA or FBI ops, straight from his desk) it makes some of Tom Clancys novels look like Dr. Seuss. JFKs priviate life was no more secret than any other president previous to his, maybe more romanticized but nothing out of the norm. Matter of fact I think it was his presidency that made people start snooping into the private lives of the presidents there-after.<br>
<br>
And I would not put the Civil War on pace with the Vietnam War as far as a divided country. The reason is that technically the south was no longer part of the US. That and the population wasn't really that informed on the subject, especially in the south, and really was only fighting because they were told that was the thing to do. Southerners were told everything from the north was coming to take all their land as their own and force them to work the fields to Britain had taken over the northern government in order to get them to fight. People in the north did it because they had a choice to either work in factories and barely make enough money to eat or fight and free slaves (even though that was not the reason the north was fighting) and eat well. So they were divided but not because of moralistic reasons but other reasons, where as the Vietnam War divided the nation based on moralistic reasons. But that is just the reason why I wouldn't include it. <p>Mcnubins Smith<br/>

Yes, they did and I think the amount is correct to, but not everyone who fough was drafted. That would be like if we got drafted today and the government said we could buy our way out of it by paying $500,000. This fact just bolsters my claim that the nation wasn't truely divided socially. <p>Mcnubins Smith<br/>

<br>
What was wrong with McCarthyism?<br>
<br>
<br>
ok case in point, back in the 50's the communist party in the United States was being &quot;possibly&quot; supported by the Soviets.<br>
<br>
McCarthy, decided to try to out as many card carrying communists from the government and places of status. <br>
<br>
What did he really accomplish? well surprisingly enough, many government jobs were being held by communist party members.<br>
<br>
ANy time some one points out that McCarthyism was bad, I have ot ask why is it bad to purge the government and people of influence from their power? Only when it goes on too long. But never the less it was nessecessary to do this. <br>

Which by the way was happening by the Soviets supporting the communist party in the USA.<br>
<br>
I love people like you who tend to forget history.<br>
<br>
In the 1950's Eisenhower was dealing with a foriegn super power (the God hating atheists known as the SOviet Union under Stalin later Kruschev).<br>
<br>
By the way this is when we had &quot;in God we trust&quot; Printed on the money and other pledges to include acknowledgment of a higher being in government to set us apart from the Soviets.<br>
<br>
Any how,<br>
<br>
I dare you to disprove me that McCarthyism was bad. It was good for flushing out alot of people who were subversive and in the process we did catch alot of spies in the government, AMericans who were spying for the Soviets. Part of what you call McCarthyism is this liberal spun story that it was a witch hunt,<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, is a witch hunt bad when you actually catch the witches doing evil deeds? No. <br>
<br>
No lets fast forward to the present. Here we have an organization thats not askingfor liberation, but its soul purpose is to Kill Americans. To top it, we have THOUSANDS of people in the United States who are onExpired Visas. Well America woke up and dealt with the situation on 9/11/01<br>
<br>
Is the USA anti-Arabic? no. <br>
<br>
Is the USA cleaning house ? yes.<br>
<br>
as for first amendant rights, please scream fire in a movie thatre and see what happens to you. Or threaten someone in public with words. <br>
<br>
In the end, if your a law abiding citizen or resident alien legally living in the USA and abide by the law your fine. <br>
<br>
Man some peopel I swear jsut hate GWB jsut because he is actually hitting the problem where its at and trimming the loose ends.<br>
