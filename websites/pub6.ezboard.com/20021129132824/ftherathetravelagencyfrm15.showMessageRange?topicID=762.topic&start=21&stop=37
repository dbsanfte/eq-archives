The [missed] point is: They have been CONTINUOUSLY changing this game since it's creation.  EVERY expansion has changed the dynamics of the game.  Every new zone, every new drop, every new quest, every new Class, every new Race has changed the dynamics of the game.<br>
<br>
AT WORST, these changes make the high end encounters more challanging (or perhaps differently challanging).  How awfull.<br>

Anyway, yeah, expansions change certain things, but they don't make certain classes have to go in a totally different direction. These changes, however, do.<br>
<br>
Monks are extremely easy to get ac gear for. Mages' prime role in raids is mod-rodding. VI's fault, and no little half-assed &quot;we regret letting things get out of control&quot; coughing apology makes up for the fact that they made them that way and guilds working within these bounds now find themselves in many situations unable to do the things they could before, and are forced down a notch in the places they can go, quite embarrassingly.<br>
<br>
I don't care about the CH change, they're obviously going to add a higher lvl version that heals more than 7.5k. I'm happy about the change to manaburn--it was necessary. Unfortunately, for every good change VI makes, they feel compelled to bash the player-base in the face with a nerf or two. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/9/02 7:38:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=762.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: wtg VI</span><hr size=1> Yeah, these changes, imo, will hurt the mid-tier and lower guilds more than the top tier ones.

<br>
Funny....but Ely's absolutly right. Odd that not more people see it.<br>
<br>
The original vision was that players would literally whack through the mobs. In basic terms, the way any given guild fights boss mobs, was how we were &quot;SUPPOSED&quot; to engage every mob. (Idiot terms - Verant NEVER considered the fact that players might &quot;pull&quot;)<br>
<br>
Knowing this, take a look at the difference between the old world and Luclin. The old world is relatively safe to walk through, really, where in Luclin, its not. It was actually stated that they based Luclin around the original vision, only with &quot;pulling&quot; in mind. Now, we can still pull in Luclin, but its a liiiiiittle tougher, and a lot harder to loaf around or walk through a zone unrisked.<br>
<br>
Basically, Luclin is a different playstyle than old world. The one we grew up in. Perhaps we adapted to Luclin, then unknowingly applied it to the old world and we dont see the difference for what it really is, but its there.<br>
<br>
Changes to classes, however....is a much more drastic thing.<br>
<br>
Its abrupt, and it leaves us (in this case, monks) with a feeling of nowhere to go. If anything, pray its not that major of a change, otherwise, I truly feel for the monks.<br>
<br>
I'd say the same for guilds, with the mod rod nerf, but Im confident that guilds will work around this.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, Ely's right. We shouldnt have played for 3 years, fine tuning our moves, only to be told &quot;All that shit you learned...unlearn it, we fucked up. Our bad.&quot;<br>

These changes are doing exactly that, and that's lame. That's all. &quot;<br>
<br>
How wrong you are.<br>
<br>
Kunark made massive changes to the game, (rogue/wiz/cleric triad anyone?). It created the 30second fight or you're dead encounter (Nag and Vox certainly weren't like this).  levels 51-60 changed the game FAR, FAR more than Luclin did.<br>
<br>
Velious changed the game too... it is the first expansion to offer signficant hp/mana items, introduced FT items, broke the 32khp barrier on mobs.. and in fact, ground the CH rotation into our heads.<br>
<br>
If anything, Luclin was just a farther push of the same philosophy as Velious.<br>
<br>
You can make all the wild ass conjecture you want, Ely... but at least get your base facts even remotely correct.<br>
<br>
This game has changed drastically several times.. once even before an add-on was shipped.. as arguably the pre-planes/dragon game at 50 was vastly different than the post planes/dragon game at 50. You could do everything in the game with 2 grps or less until Nag/Vox/PoF.<br>
<br>
I don't agree with all changes, hell.. I doubt I agree with most of em.. but I do continue to try to have more than perspective on the whys/hows it is changed.. as opposed to the &quot;usual backseat designer internet crybaby&quot; approach that 99% of board posters become when ANY change takes place.<br>
<br>
The difference is how you handle it.. vote with your checkbook, or adapt. Those are the only two options. <p>Nicolai, Haste Puller<br>

We're not &quot;usual backseat designer internet crybabies&quot;. <br>
We're customers. Customers have a right to expect their product to not become something else. Kunark was seriously fucked, I agree, with the added levels and no thought on balancing, but tell me, how many monks were there before Kunark anyway? Not nearly as many. People made monks to take advantage of the way VI was directing the game (Hmm, we use all this nice loot along with all the other monk abilities? Damn.) Since monks were made to be able to tank, and could do all the other things they could do, people made them.<br>
<br>
Now, had VI changed this then, it wouldn't have been a problem. But for a player who's put in over 100, or even 200 days played on a given char, it's hardly fair to wake up and find that your oven has suddenly turned into a toaster.<br>
<br>
As for mages, when were they ever unruined? At least rods made them somewhat wanted. When you make the game a certain way, you'd damned sure better expect the players to play it that way instead of the way you &quot;intended&quot; them to.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is, you set the classes up, people play them to take advantage of what they have, and if you don't fix it fast, then you have NO right to do it 3 years down the line.<br>

Reducing their defense.  By how much?  /shrug<br>
<br>
Their skill set has not changed. Their armor is not being removed. In FACT, probably with PoP even better armor will be available to them, that may well offset any Defense reduction.<br>

Ultimately, they will be played pretty much they way they are now.  <br>

Wrong, we pay for a service. Nothing more. You don't own your character, nor the pixels that are associated with it. They can (and have, and will continue) to change at their whim. At some point, you can a) Accept this, b) Gripe about (but still really accept) it, c) Find a game that is more to your suiting (ie. non dynamic).<br>
<br>
Not a single MMRPG has stayed static over the course of six months, much less 3 years.. UO has changed drastically more times than I care to remember, EQ the same.. AO .. the same... DAoC.. the same... so why are you surprised, and more importantly.. why the indignation?<br>
<br>
This is not some new diabolic scheme.. this is business as usual for these guys.. for better or in alot of cases, worse.<br>
<br>
10 days, 100days, 300 days, played doesn't entitile you to any permanence.. again.. you PAY FOR A SERVICE, not a property within the world.<br>
<br>
Every expansion has had massive changes, every period before an expansion has had tweaks.. changes.. etc. Why do you think this would be different.. if ANYTHING.. I agree with most of the changes in this tweak.<br>
<br>
Do you really want ANOTHER expansion full of 30+ minute fights? Do you really want to be the mage that not only p00ps rods for that 30minutes, but constantly picks them and drops them.. to keep the refresh timer active? Is that really fun?<br>
<br>
Do I like the fact that they're making monks more paper than tank? Not really.. but I will adapt. At least they're trying to solve problems (in their own Jerry Lewis/Dean Martin way), and not just throwing up their hands and adding MORE ac60 monk items.<br>
<br>
All in all, I am glad they're changing things BEFORE the next expansion.. instead of in the MIDDLE of it. I may not disagree with their changes, but until they make one that talks me into keeping my $13/mo.. you won't see me incessantly whining about it.<br>

No, Kunark made massive changes to Kunark. Kunark didnt change the way you played the game. It changed the way you played in Kunark. <br>
<br>
Same goes with velious, and Luclin.<br>

Changes to a class, as I stated, are drastic changes, effecting you directly, which means you must change the way you play ANYWHERE. <br>
<br>
I think thats the point she was trying to make. It was surely the point I was trying to make. <p><a href=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Database/scripts/character-page.php?charid=5>Kluz</a><br><embed src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Flash/kluzsig.swf" quality=high pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="200" height="150"></embed><br><a href=http://www.fallenshadows.cjb.net>Fallen Shadows</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uelysianaheathertoes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ElysianaHeathertoes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/02 2:28:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=762.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: wtg VI</span><hr size=1> I hadn't intended to reply again to this, but I just couldn't believe some of the things I just read.<br>
<br>
EQ is a service? Oh, really? Then I find it quite funny that I paid up around $200 for 2 boxes that each include a GAME and all its various expansions.<br>
<br>
And yeah, it's true that VI has no responsibility to do anything for their customers, but you'd assume that any company that's pulling in around $5 million a month from the people who've kept their game alive and well for over 3 years should have a little more respect for them.<br>

The fact is these changes are GOOD because they indicate a step in the right direction in terms of an approach by VI to fix this game and keep it going. Many people disagree with particulars, or think some things could be done better, but most of the experienced players will admit this is good.<br>
<br>
These changes are good. They show VI is thinking about how to fix some of the MAJOR problems/issues with this game and issues that will come up in PoP (I'm amazed they are actually doing this NOW instead of 6 months after PoP has ruined other encounters). We can worry about the actual changes, and they may reverse/alter some of these changes, and will definitely add more, but abject *whining* about it is worthless and the complaints show how completely out of whack some people's view of this game is.<br>
<br>
So yes, as the subject title of this thread says, I say &quot;WTG VI&quot;. You are actually listening to the players and trying to get the game more balanced.<br>

Maybe this is good for us hard core monk lovers. Maybe now the number of monks played will drop and it will mean we are more of a commodity. =) maybe wishful thinking but who knows. I love playing my character and as much as I hate to see him nerfed a little, Im not gonna stop playing him just cuz of that.  <p><center><b>Berkin De'Marco<br><I>The Ladies Lizard</I><br> Aegis D'Caelestis </B> <br> <I>"Say Sweet Thang, can I buy you a fish sandwich?"</I><BR> </center></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=762.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=762.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=762.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=762.topic&index=37><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=762.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=762.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=762.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=762.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15>Flame Central</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
