I just noticed your post. How convenient for you to talk about cockblocking sitting in the elemental planes, when you had how many chances at Rallos before he went on Rotation? Now guilds that get to the point of trying him are going to get their one shot per rotation? Please, get on one side or the other of the discussion. I accept he's on rotation and NB is going to take a lot longer to get our attempts in against him than Tindi or BOTS did, but for you to sit there and paint guilds that don't like teaming as &quot;cockblockers&quot; and while sitting on the other side of the Rallos Zek rotation is a bit much. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I do not know the history here, though my imagination does wander; <br>
<br>
It has always been, detrimental or not, the case that the first guild to kill a mob gets it pretty much unfettered; the second guild to kill the same mob, may or may not work out a rotation with the first; but there are always a few that get to kill it often compared to the guilds entering into a rotation. <br>
<br>
The situation with Ralloz Zek and who is on the rotation notwithstanding; depending on the circumstances, it may well be hypocritical to take a position on 'cockblocking' when a guild makes it onto a rotation before another, but lets remember the distinction here; there is no rotation on Aerin Dar. <br>
<br>
Had there been one, justified in some way, this would not have happened. <br>
<br>
And for the record, I don't think people that don't like teaming are cockblockers by definition; I think there are many, like you Karadin, that feel it is 'cheating' our system and I respect the urge to change that. <br>
<br>
However, I do not feel that extending current conventions is the answer, nor do I think it is an appropriate situation to extend conventions to; if we want to discuss new approaches, I think that is just fine, and will obviously willingly discuss a solution that is fair to all.<br>

Maybe this will be stated in a way that makes more sense. Currently there are many many mobs that are 'not on rotation' that do allow access to other zones that people can 'xp' in.<br>
<br>
These mobs include Terris Thule, Behemoth, Grummus, and of course Aerin`Dar. After this point, there becomes other mobs that stand in the way of accessing Sol Ro Tower, which is a zone that can support MASSIVE amounts of 'xp' groups if they wanted to do it. These mobs include Mith Marr, Saryrn, Bertoxx, Tallon and Vallon Zek.<br>
<br>
Now, lets say a guild can get into HoH, Tactics, CoD, and Torment by themselves. Then smaller guilds decide to team up, or even run FFA flagging raids, where they just invite tons of small guild or non guilded people, and zerg the encounters to death, then these people pour into CoD, HoH, Tactics, etc..<br>
<br>
Now you have these zones swamped with people that took the short and fast way into a new xp zone, only to discover it is now overcrowded and not worth being in for anyone, JUST LIKE PoN! Heheh. So now the guilds that got into these zones say WTF?!? this place sucks now, we need new xp grounds, LoM and VoF (just making this up) decide they want to get into Sol Ro Tower to escape the mass throng of people. So they team up to take down Mith Marr, Bertoxx, Saryrn, and the Zek twins..Now they are in Sol Ro Tower.<br>
<br>
So what, right? Well this leads to even more problems. Now it takes even longer for solo guilds to get to the top, due to people double teaming the mobs the solo guilds HAVE TO KILL to get flagged up to where they are trying to get to. The teaming guilds are taking content away from the guilds that have to kill these mobs to get where they need to be. This is what none of the guilds past tier 2 want to see.<br>
<br>
Now I understand, you may not want anything more than instant access to HoH rather than doing the timesink quest. However, others could use the same precident, to basically clear all the way up the chain to the stopper which would be Rallos (since it is on rotation). You could even possibly have a 2 team guild that decides to merge all other rotations for a month, take down Rallos a few times, then 'break' the alliance, and within a week be back on all their old rotations separately. Meanwhile sitting pretty in the Elemental Planes, where there is lots of room to xp, minibosses that they COULD kill as a seperate guilds that drop elemental armor, and reap the massive bonuses of all the elemental tradeskill loots that can be farmed by single groups.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, guilds that choose to go solo get left behind while guilds that have chosen to ally up to the top, get all the benefits of doing so, to the detriment of the other guilds that had to go it alone. I'm sure both BotS and Tindi and eventually NB and others, would not want to share the elemental armor drops (which are not too common when the goal is to equip your entire guild just to defeat the elemental gods to get into PoTime) with guilds that have no intentions of leaving the elemental planes for a long long time, and just want to rake in loot they cannot put to use due to the difficulty of the Elemental gods...<br>
<br>
Teaming on these tier 1-2 bosses will set precidence if not looked at soon, and we will end up seeing an allied Bertox kill which will open up another can of worms entirely, since he is the biggest stopper on the way to Sol Ro Tower.<br>
<br>
That is the fear of any of these guilds that have moved into the tier 3-4 zones alone. I personally could care less if AD dies to anyone, because I am in the Elemental planes, however I'm sure VoF, LoM, SoTE and others sitting where they are, would and may feel differently about that.<br>
<br>
What is the solution? I don't know at this point. AD on rotation is absurd. But how else do you enforce anything without it being part of the rotation system.<br>
<br>
Now on CB and VoLS side of the fence. I have been there before. Teaming up to get to a less crowded(for now) xp area makes so much sense, as opposed to it taking 100 times as long by doing the single questing system. Grats on the kill even, AD is a difficult mob, and takes skill and sometimes a bit of luck. NB is not concerned about you guys having access to 'xp', but if you all decided later to advance beyond, there is nothing to stop you from teaming all the way up the flag chain, or others from doing it and then using you all as an example of why it is ok for them to do it.<br>
<br>
Some think that this is fine, some do not, it definately deserves to be looked into further, and an agreement needs to be made on how teaming flag mobs is handled other than just the no piggy backing clause.<br>
<br>

And this, I think, is truly the heart of the problem.  If you are there already, you try to protect your turf and reap the rewards from them as uncontested as possible for as long as possible.  Now, this does not mean that you actively block other guilds by perma-killing flag mobs, but it does mean that you try to enforce rules on non-rotational mobs that state that &quot;if you don't do it like we did, you can't do it&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm sure both BotS and Tindi and eventually NB and others, would not want to share the elemental armor drops (which are not too common when the goal is to equip your entire guild just to defeat the elemental gods to get into PoTime) with guilds that have no intentions of leaving the elemental planes for a long long time, and just want to rake in loot they cannot put to use due to the difficulty of the Elemental gods...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Same sentiment.  You are sitting there pretty uncontested, farm to your hearts' delight and, in a perfect world, don't want to share if it was up to you.  Although I do not understand fully why guilds that would get to the elemental planes would not benefit from those drops there.<br>
<br>
I think there really is not much to say to the whole thing.  It is clear that guilds that made it to tier 3/4 would like the status quo of personal farming grounds in these zones to stay the way it is, while guilds trying to advance to the next tiers to improve their guild (which in turn allows them to do more difficult mobs) see any restrictions imposed by tier 3/4 guilds as simple attempts to keep them away as long as possible.  I don't see how you can find a solution that everybody is happy with, so the question becomes whose interests you are going to put first. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Maybe say no teaming on mobs that give keys to zones that don't have an alternate means of entry?  Example: Allow teaming on mobs like Aerin'Dar, Behemoth, and Grummus because HoH, Drunder, and CoD have alternate means of entry.  So making these mobs non-teamable isn't keeping people out of said planes, but would only slow the influx of people into them.  Mobs that allow access into zones that don't have an alternate means of access i.e. pretend Rallos Zek wasn't on a rotation, people wouldn't team on him, because there's no way to get to that zone without it.<br>
<br>
Is something like this an option at all?  Just thought I'd put it out there, to help come to a middle ground between the 2 extremes of the 'hey, you're just cockblocking' and 'if you can't do it alone, don't do it' people. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=264293" target="top">Sir Sladen Paladian</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I can understand a no-teaming rule for things that are non-questable, but I disagree with the fairness of it.<br>
<br>
It's all relative to the sandbox theory.  You take a child, put them in a sandbox and watch them.  Another child is welcome as they want company.  However, when the children start to flock towards the sandbox because of the cool toys, watch those already *in* the sandbox get angry and refuse to let them in.  They want to keep it to themselves.<br>
<br>
Whereas we're not children, the theory still holds water.<br>

&quot;PoP flags: PoP was specifically designed so that only high-end guilds could get into the higher tiers. There will be no alternate means of entry to elemental planes, such as through quests. There's a second reason too. The loot in elemental planes is so good it's considered the reward for getting there. ie instead of putting good loot on Rallos Zek as a reward for killing him, they put good loot in the elemental planes as a reward for killing Rallos Zek. They'd have to tune it down if there were other means of getting into those planes.&quot;<br>

<br>
I wasn't going to reply (because of people complaining about the thoroughness of my posts), but since people seem to think you've &quot;stumped&quot; the guilds who object to teaming, I have to.<br>
<br>
The reason your recommendation won't work is twofold.<br>
<br>
1)  It sets a precedent that PoP mobs can be teamed up on, while guilds remain separate for all other rotations.  This is against the basic convention established when Trak rotation was first set up - kill the mob on your own to get on rotation.  This precedent will be used later, maybe not by you, as reason why all PoP mobs can be teamed on.  If no teaming is allowed, it's consistent.<br>
2)  What is then to stop an Alliance from forming just until Rallos is dead, then breaks up.  If you want to do that now, by all means, but you will have had to work through all PoP content as a single alliance for all rotations, and will have paid the same price the rest of us do.  And if you think that getting through all the flags you need for the Elemental Planes is a short path, you haven't done your research.<br>
<br>
Finally, for those saying &quot;Hey, this thread is moot because there is a quest for getting in&quot;, I say, then do the quest.  You will have worked hard to get in, and since you will be only one of a few who has access to the zone, you'll be on your best behavior since getting a res won't be a given. Please don't try and justify getting PoP progression flags when &quot;all you're after is xp flags&quot;.  There is a world of difference between the flag the quest gives you and the Aerin Dar flag.<br>
<br>
And again, for those claiming this is about xp zone &quot;protection&quot;, I don't xp in HoH.  6-12 soloing or duoing casters and the xp camps are full, and they rarely want a rogue who can't really contribute to their kiting/root doting/charm soloing.<br>
<br>
For those claiming this is about &quot;cash cow&quot; hoarding - there is no loot that drops in great quantity in HoH that sells for large quantities of cash.  Wristbands of strategy are barely better than BD bracers.  Windblades?  Gone.  Spectral drops?  Sure, those average about one to two in eight hours or more of xp grinding (or so my casters tell me, and it bears through when I used to xp there).  And of course, let's remember, not every spectral turned in suddenly yields a 50k+ spell, how many copies of Pacification or Greater Fetter do you have?  We get most of our spectrals off the PoP flag mobs we kill for progression.  (Those claiming these flag mobs have no loot, please take notice).  The zone mobs aren't what have the loot, its the flagging mobs - the ones we need to further our progression.<br>
<br>
I don't want my HoH trials blown by some xp group that sees a red named giving out what looks like a quest and blows my guilds plans for the night when I have finally worked out those who need flags and have managed to get them online.  <br>
<br>
I am tired of watching people kite in the GY claiming &quot;its an xp spot&quot; as they kill the guy who just got a res, who couldn't move his body if he wanted to.<br>
<br>
I am tired of having 10-15 straggler guildmates die when we go to do a trial because some idiot left a Recurso see invis mob from the Far Left Courtyard at the zone in (for those who have never been there, this would be akin to someone leaving a see invis Desert Giant in Plane of Storms at the zone in in terms of distance and work taken to accomplish, this is not lazy stupidity).  No, I have no desire to limit people's &quot;xp zones&quot;, if the HoH trials were somehow protected from every xp &quot;group&quot; in HoH like Aerin Dar is, I wouldn't care about you being in HoH xping.<br>
<br>
Do the guilds that got in on their own do kite in the GY or leave SIBs at the zone?  Sure, sometimes, but a heck of a lot more common these days than before.  And when it is one of those guilds, a simple tell gets the problem fixed.  And they never blow trials on us, just like we never blow them.  They know that if we have extra flags available, we will do the event and help them out with a few flags, and vice versa.  Blowing content is counter to their best interest.  A guild that teamed, and thus is not extended that same courtesy, could easily be a hindrance with an axe to grind.<br>
<br>

<br>
Karadin , your last post , actually makes more sense, now ... <br>
Maybe cause its not threating anything , which some people have been so eager to do ... <br>
<br>
Just a few comments .... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1) It sets a precedent that PoP mobs can be teamed up on, while guilds remain separate for all other rotations.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
1. If my understanding is correct , precedent on this issue was already set with the FK / LOM issue when they did this , and nothing was done then at that point in time . <br>
<br>
2. Aerin'dar is not a Rotation mob , and why the point that it will affect how PoP rotation mobs are handled , still makes me wonder. If Aerin'dar was a rotation mob , that would be one thing , but Arien'dar isn't a rotation mob. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2) What is then to stop an Alliance from forming just until Rallos is dead, then breaks up.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again this is a rotation mob ... Arien'dar is not ... so not exactly sure where this point is going , other than the fact that it would allow them access to Elemental planes . <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you want to do that now, by all means, but you will have had to work through all PoP content as a single alliance for all rotations, and will have paid the same price the rest of us do<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
As pointed out to Livius in the General Forum , while I at least now understand where the &quot;convention&quot; that is being claimed is coming from ... There is no rule stating this ... PoP zones are not covered in any of the Rotation Rules , or other Planer Rules ... <br>
<br>
There is a rule stating that a Posting Entity may only invite 6 members from any other posting entity to a scheduled plane raid ... However, this is in regards to PoF , PoH , and PoS ... No where does it inidicate that this is something that is gamewide ... <br>
<br>
Any rule in regards to Rotation mobs , I see as moot , as Arien'dar is not a rotation mob .... If Arien'dar was a rotation mob , this would be a completley different issue , and I might actually find this as something that is more viable. <br>
<br>
<br>
If you want to keep taking the approach about PoP rotation mobs , then make a motion for putting Arien'Dar on rotation ... Granted you'll most likely have to do this for several other mobs at the same time to be consistant , but this will at least put the mob(s) in the realm of Rotations , that keeps being brought up.   <br>
<br>
<br>
And Unfortunately , Convention is something that is informal ... After seeing some of the things that I've seen I would definately say that the Rathe is a server of Formal , not Informal , and anything that is left Informal will cause exactly what this has . <br>

But piggybacks have not. I know that guilds who participate to the dragon quest in PoI have sometimes opened there doors for others to be flagged, not because they need the help, but because they want to extend a helping hand to the community. What would be the policy on mobs like AD and grummus, or even flag mobs for which there is no quest access? This is not an issue of a guild getting on a rotation with outside help, nothing stops guilds who have established themselves on a rotation from inviting guests. So what then does the community say about this? <br>
<br>
Sprigg Skittlebrow&quot;<br>
<br>
To answer this one.. the guilds that are currently killing Flag mobs have adhered to the &quot;no guests at their first killing&quot; rule of Rotations. Thereafter, the &quot;unofficial rule&quot; that has been followed is that guests for flagging can only come from guilds that have already killed the flag mob.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, here are a few other Rules that have been set up:<br>
<br>
On Alliances:<br>
pub6.ezboard.com/ftherath...ID=8.topic<br>
<br>
On Rotation Entry:<br>

<br>
All of the &quot;rules&quot; that have been set down:<br>
pub6.ezboard.com/ftherath...gencyfrm52<br>
<br>
Now, if you notice, there are &quot;rules&quot; in place about &quot;teaming&quot; or &quot;making alliances&quot;. The guilds that have done PoP Flag Mobs had every right to feel that these &quot;rules&quot; would be carried thru to the new content, without having to be re-iterated again.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dytren>Dytren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>SL - Guild Rep</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/7/03 5:30:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=297.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Teaming in PoP.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>To answer this one.. the guilds that are currently killing Flag mobs have adhered to the &quot;no guests at their first killing&quot; rule of Rotations. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Sorry this does not cover here ... Sorry but this covers rotations , and does not cover non rotation mobs. <br>
<br>
Arien'Dar is a Non Rotation mob ... Thanks ... Please someone get off this Rotation topic ... <br>
<br>
2 Guilds got together as friends , and killed a Non Rotation mob , Grats to them ... and Anyone claiming any rule based on Rotations isn't holding any type of water with this. <br>
<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>On Rotation Entry:<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again this has absolutely nothing to do with Rotation ... Please change your argument .... <br>
<br>
On counter note here ... Just read both &quot;Rules&quot; on Rotation Entry , and Rotation Etiquette  and No Where ... I reapeat NO WHERE does it state , that once on a rotation , the Guild may not have Invites.   <br>
<br>
Please note at this point in time , I recognize the fact that you will most likely counter with the following: <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>  You may invite whoever you wish along on your raids, as long as no more than 6 come from the same Posting Entity. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
However , If you read the rest of the post that this came from , you will not read a single solitary thing about rotations ... The thread that this came from is in regards to Planar Reservations (PoH , PoF , and PoS) .... NOT Rotations .... <br>
<br>
Again Change your argument.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Thereafter, the &quot;unofficial rule&quot; that has been followed is that guests for flagging can only come from guilds that have already killed the flag mob.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is based off of your Rotation argument , which again this is not about a rotation mob ... Next argument please. <br>
<br>
The whole entire fact that this is also an &quot;Unoffical Rule&quot; also meand exactly jack diddly ... Please refer to one of my other posts , where I stated that this is a Community not a Dictatorship , and attempting to Enforce these so called UnOfficial Rules , is exactly that ... a Dictatorship ...

<br>
That is why we are attmpting to create a NEW rule for these types of mobs.  A rule that many of us believe should parrell the no teaming rule that rotations us.<br>
<br>
To main reason people are drawing this parrell how these flags mobs advance a guild simialarly to how a rotation mob advances a guild.   All of the largesr guilds on the server have agreed to share the various content through the use of rotations, this sharing of content slows the progressing of guild greatly.  For example, BotS had to share the loot from Cursed during the last days of Luclin, when that loot would have made then a stronger guild (having better equiped members, more mana, more hps, etc).  <br>
<br>
PoP flag mobs are even more directly linked to progessing through the game.  Getting a new flag generally gives you access to a new zone, with new mobs to fight both exp mobs and boss mobs.  This in turn grants you better loot, and in the case of PoP possibly the most important loot of all, parchments.<br>
<br>
Now the problem we are facing is that on rotation mobs everyone has agreed that to be on a rotation, you have to kill the mob by yourself.  Whatever entity you are, you must do it alone.  To gain access to this content, you must be able to kill it alone.  <br>
<br>
Then we get to PoP flag mobs, which have not needed to be on any formal rotations to date for a few reasons.  And because of this fact that they are not on rotation, people are now teaming up to progress further into the game than they would be able to achieve alone.<br>
<br>
This is the main problem.  The larger guilds have agreed to slow down thier progression through the game by allowing anyone that can kill a mob to join its rotation, but now the smaller guilds are trying to speed up thier own progression through the game even further by teaming up to kill mobs they would not be able to do alone.  The larger guilds feel this is an abuse of the rotation system that restricts them to only one share of the content on rotation mobs, while smaller guilds that are teaming up in PoP get multiple turns.<br>
<br>
It would be like Tindi Losi breaking into 3 smaller guilds for all Rotation mobs, then those 3 guilds working together to advance through PoP.<br>
<br>
The problem never was CB and VoLS teaming up to kill a mob, it was the fact that they teamed up to progress further in the game in PoP, but remain seperate entities to progress through non PoP rotation mobs.<br>
<br>
This is why we are asking for a new disignation for PoP flag mobs, ones that advance a guild further into the game.  And new rules on these mobs that mirror the restrictions already in place on rotation mobs currently. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showMessageRange?topicID=297.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=297.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=297.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=297.topic&index=33><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=297.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.threadControl?topicID=297.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=297.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=297.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm68">Current World Events<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm69">Elemental Planes</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11>Guild Representatives Forum</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
