<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You don't &quot;encourage&quot; someone to do something by punishment.  You &quot;encourage&quot; people moving deeper in dungeons by rewarding them with more xp for killing harder mobs, not by removing the xp lower end mobs give, thus crippling soloers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Secondly, in regards to your idea that somehow DOT stacking will help a shaman solo. . .read the patch message.  DOT stacking only allows two or more shamans or necros to stack the same DOT on the same creature without overwriting one another.  It does not allow one shaman or necro to cast the same DOT on the same mob again and again.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thirdly, no matter how you look at it, with the game's crowded servers, removing any high end content is a bad thing.  What percentage of the playerbase do you think has a L 50+ character?  I would say at least 50%.  Now you want to &quot;encourage&quot; all those players to go to only a handful of zones?  Do you remember L Guk and Sol B pre-Kunark?  If this patch stays, that is what CT, Ssra, Umbral Plains, and Deep Chardok/Akheva will become.  Anyone wanting to xp as they were before this patch will have to sit in overcrowded zones waiting for hours for a spot to open up.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fourthly, guild raid resentment will shoot through the roof.  Expect lots of group buffs being cast to find the 4 rogue or 4 wizard group who is getting all the big mob kills.  Knowing that not only does that group get first look at what loot dropped, but also made 4% AA xp while your whole raid basically powerleveled them, and watch new heights of grief.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fifthly, I see you making all these points about druids and shamans getting better heals, but I see no mention of it in the patch message.  So they lose soloing as a viable alternative, and still have no enticing reasons to be wanted in groups or more raid utility. . .   How exactly is this balanced?<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sixthly, I think it incredibly cheesy that they add more soloability to clerics at 56+, and then nerf soloing in its entirety.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If Verant leaves this patch as is, I expect to see a lot of cancelled accounts.  Soloers who feel hosed, casual players who can't xp nearly as well as before, hybrids who aren't as wanted in groups, but can't get near the xp they used to, etc.  Overall, I think this is one of the shoddiest, least thought out, and downright wrong patches I can imagine.  And it's real.  That's the scary thing.<br>
<br>
I will say one nice thing about the patch.  I missed the Ding noise, and glad they gave it to making AAs.  Too bad it will be such a rare noise. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

It's one thing to develop a group-based game where soloing isn't productive. It's quite another to have a char lvl almost to 60 and make them have to shift into a style of play they might not be used to.<br>
<br>
But the big problem is, everyone who doesn't go after big mobs is gonna get a lot less xp than they used to. Jack up higher mobs' xp, great, but don't punish people for killing the same mobs they've been killing. It's fine to talk about the big dungeons, but for some people they're not an option.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I think ToV as an xp dungeon would be hilarious. Make all the lvl 60s lurking in Seb and Velks downing aaxp go and give a couple more people a chance at some good loots in those dungeons.<br>

<br>
for now, druids will have a little bit harder time exp'ing than we normally do, but it does not bother me much. The heals will come in time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> As for quadding:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
It cracks me up that this is continuously brought up as the way a druid gets exp, or is the &quot;uber&quot; exp for druids. Quadding past level 56 ( or when raptors start to light blue out) is rediculously inefficient for 90% of us (druids) out there. Quadding takes about 4 bars of mana to kill a mob; give or take a little. Now, the average druid does not have FT15 and maybe does not have a ready supply of c3 available. this means that after each quad, there is approximately 15 minutes of medding. <br>
<br>
At 56, i got 1/4 a blue quadding raptors in TD. Half that at 57. Then at 58, i tried ME quadding toilers. still the same efficiency, but roughly 1% of regular exp per quad. Melees in FG are far more efficient killers than this.<br>
<br>
This is why a good portion of druids do not quad at all post 57; many find a nice quiet spot to root / dot them<br>
<br>
getting late so im going to speed things up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> As for Healing:[/b<br>
<br>
Back 2 years ago, this was not even a problem; but now, mob HP, DPS, and warrior HP have all increased, while the druid heal has not. We simply want to be put back where we originally were as far as healing goes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> As for whin</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Over a year of proposing new ideas, comparing HP / DPS / mob HP, nearly every heal in the game, and explaining how things have changed in the heal line over the past few years is hardly something i would call whining. we didnt just wake up 2 weeks ago and say, &quot;hey, i think a new heal would be nice.&quot; This has been going on for almost a year now.<br>

Lol, long time no speak.. <br>
<br>
First, I don't see anything that was done as punishment. That's just me. They did increase exp that higher end mobs give, and I don't think that lower end mobs exp has been decreased as much as it seems, because of the removal of hell levels.<br>
<br>
2nd. I wasn't talking about stacking the same dot one on top of the other. As I understand it, from recent conversations, only 2 or 3 dots per mob really had any effect. This patch changed that.<br>
<br>
3rd..What do you think people are doing in Seb/Velk's/KC now, if they're not sitting at zone-in for an hour looking for group? Granted, there are classes such as pallies/sk's/monks that frequently solo in these zones, but what about the rest of us? Making the soloing of these completely 'risk-free' exp mobs less efficient in my opinion, will make these dungeons more usable by the players that get the most out of the mobs. And, I don't have a problem with the upper lvl zones becoming places you can LFG in. Like I stated before, I find it not at all challenging, or entertaining killing the same mobs at 60 that I did at 50.<br>
<br>
4th... I agree.<br>
<br>
5th.. No, as far as I know, they weren't put into this patch, but it's almost assured that they are coming. And no, I don't think it's fair that they split the nerfing into one patch, and the upgrade into another.<br>
<br>
6th.. How many 56+ clerics were really going to solo, anyway?<br>
<br>
Finally, I see and understand all of your points. Do I think soloers are getting hosed? Not really, because I play two classes that suck at soloing, and have always resented the fact that those classes can gain lvls faster than I can. I don't think casual players will get exp less efficiently, if they move out of zones that have been risk-free and elementary bullshit for 5-7 levels. And, I don't think hybrids have truly ever had that much difficulty finding a group, especially of late. SKs and Pallies are as good, or better tanks that warriors, rangers are doing mass damage with bows, and bards have never had to look long for a group.<br>
<br>
So, while I understand your points, and appreciate their validity to some extent, I ask you this.. What's fun about a game that is only challenging every once in a while? Once I beat Mario Bros. for the 3rd time, I quit playing it. Well, fighting in Seb/Velks/KC with a lvl 60 toon, is like playing Ultima in God Mode.. How is that really fun?<br>

Mostly 55 seems to be the hell level of all hell levels... <br>
<br>
I was in king in Seblis for roughly 3 hours, did a yellow AA, took maybe 30 min, for the other 2 hours 30 min, killing al ton of mobs that were BARELY blue, some whites and the odd yellow, I was rewarded w/ just under 2 blues.... Now the 57 bard, 59 warrior, 60 chanter, 56 rogue and 58 cleric were raving about thier exp... <br>
<br>
Me 55 ranger was getting the exp I got prepatch killing lblue and blue in DL solo... /shrug AA was superb but 55 seems to bee all the hell levels combined into 1 now imho.<br>
<br>
After seeing this I am only too scared to see what kind of exp i'd get in Guard, or a camp in KC... As for the Ghey, err Grey, it's been fuct up for about 20 patches now... I stopped going there, necro and I used to duo there but they've added about a billion traps...<br>
<br>
I think this is all a ploy by verant to make us get out VP keys so we can exp off the 2 min repop guardian wurms in there.<br>

I've killed over 10,000 otters. I quit counting at 10,000. I soloed almost exclusively from lvl 56 to 60 with 32 AA off of otters. I kill them so quickly now that after taking down 8 of them and medding I still have time to kill some drakes or othmir shaman before warrior repops.<br>
<br>
On raids I wish I could heal better. Too many times we've been wiped out because of a lack of healing. I'd prefer to not heal in 'exp' groups. I think that a fairly mana heavy heal that healed half of the max hp of the target would be great for druids and shamans.<br>
<br>
After the UP patch Elysians always resisted my spells often until I reached 60. Most of the time we hunted them in a group of 2 or 3 druids.<br>
<br>
I can see where the line of sight change will make it more difficult to kite in many of the common kiting places.<br>
