It’s okay man. There is a lot going on in the Raids and most don’t really trickle down to the raiders, for different reasons. In the case of some of the changes in Vox raid it was split minute changes that had to be done in order for us to all make it to our goal. Taking Vox down. <br>
<br>
“Are plane mobs the same?”<br>
<br>
I’m not a caster so I’m not 100% on what you need to be in melee range for or not. I know Giants and Dragons are a most, I’m guessing Gods and the mini bosses are the same. As for the Random monsters in the planes, no I don’t think you need to be in Melee range. <br>
<br>
“Melee range for spells only?”<br>
<br>
All offensive spells, for Giants and dragons you need to be basically standing under them to work. I don’t know why &lt;shrug&gt; just do. Giants also can’t be Mezed but can be Charmed. <br>
<br>
“I saw you once but didn`t know your were support.”<br>
<br>
&lt;LOL&gt; Was spending a lot of time Banished or in the lair. <br>
<br>
“And didn`t know that we were getting mobs pulled to us. Thought they were the ones that snuk past support I would have been paying more attention.”<br>
<br>
Yeah we had to do a split second change there. When I noticed we didn’t have the number of people needed to tank like 4 giants and some Ice Terrors I had to call you guys in to help. There was no way I (a non-taunter) would be able to hold aggro on them all. Cleric would have died and the rest of the team shortly after. The pull didn’t really go right, The puller died and I want around the corner to pull the ones we got out of the lair to you guys and got Banished. The Mage I think tried the same think and got his pretty robe all bloody with his own blood (Didn’t aggro vox so didn’t get banished and the giants beat him to a pulp) so all that was left was the Cleric. She ran out and grabbed then and only had time to call in the INC when they all stormed in to the room. On the second pull of giants the cleric went to heal the puller and got banished. &lt;LOL&gt; That’s also the time we all had to camp for a bit because someone had healed, buffed or something the pulled and still had Vox Aggroed so she was walking from her spawn to the way out of her lair and down to the where the buffing area was. (Not a good place to have her when you’re trying to buff) I figured I would just charge some Giants on you all and you could kill them, the other option was listening to me for like 30 minutes explaining what was going on. &lt;Snicker&gt; It all worked out. I had no doubt you guys would kill the giants.<br>
<br>
And behold… Order in Chaos.<br>

Leading these raids can be some of the most stressful times you'll ever have in EQ and they definitly are not always fun for the leader.  But without them, we would not have these raids.  And so it is good that people always seem to step forward to fill these gaps.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to apologize for not making it.  Unfortunatly my alliance was deep in Hate that night.  However, after my 4th or 5th death I was in the Bazaar when people began to shout that Vox was dead.  I immediatly sent Azure a tell congratulating her.  Considering how many other guilds have failed, this was a major accomplishment.  Something everyone should be proud of.<br>
<br>
Now then.  Yes, you need to be in melee range for nukes to hit a dragon.  Many mobs are like this, post 55.  This includes planar mobs.  Not all of course, many you can nuke from a distance.  However, especially the mini's you need to be under the mob for the nuke to land.  And of course, there are always tho pesky Sprite Golems that are so MR that even lures have a hard time landing.<br>
<br>
These raids can be very confusing.  Not just to those in the raid, but those who are leading it.  I've heard many people say that when their guild/alliance does these things that these problems dont exist.  And that is true.  However, you are then dealing with maybe 30 people that you mostly know.  If Azure knew 10 people on that raid personally and had hunted with them a lot I'd be surprised.  Command and Control in a KCoG raid is an exercise in chaos and confusion.  Along with trying to figure out stratagies on the fly, you are coordinating with the support group, you are figuring out the buff line, watching the kills, getting tells from 4-10 people at once, and healing or buffing your group.  All at the exact same time.  And this goes on from the second the raid starts, or even before, to the end of it.  The amount of multi tasking these raids need is enormous.  Far, far more than any other raid I've lead for my alliance or guild.<br>
<br>
There will be goof ups.  There will be mistakes.  You often will leave 6-10 hours later with no xp or loot.  But the point of these things are not loot.  Its about seeing a dragon or a plane for the first time.  Its about doing something that on most servers only a privilaged few ever get to see.  Its about being able to be a casual player who only gets on for a few hours a day or week and still being able to do these things.  Even if your guild or alliance is unable to do them.  <br>
<br>
I'm not going to say that complaints have no place here.  They do.  But try to understand that these things are set up, not for loot or xp, but for the best chance at success.  That means having a support team.  And you only get the best if you can offer them something in return.  And all they themselves get for 6 or 10 hours of their time is the chance of rolling on something.  They're putting their time and xp and possible death on the line just as much as anyone else.  Believe me, its just as easy for a 56 to die as a 46.  And even if you feel the support team didnt do anything, and often they dont or are not all that effective, just having them is a major boost to the raid and the raid leader.  Even if, for example, Steelheart didnt do anything the whole raid but stand there and look pretty, his being there would assure any raid leader that even under the worst case of a total wipeout, they have an experienced corpse puller standing by to do their thing.  That sort of support cannot be measured.<br>
<br>
In the end, I salute those who spent the time and xp to be there to see Vox die.  It was the first time since BEFORE December 4th that she has died.  She was up for almost 2 weeks without being taken down.  Many of the largest and most skilled guilds and alliances on the server have tried and failed against her.  Once again, showing that  problems and all, KCoG always rises to a challenge and does what it must to take that lizard down.  Congratulations again.  To everyone.<br>
