I was a young cleric, just level 5, when I was approached by a dazzling cleric all in banded.  She gave me cloth armor, some advice, and watched over me while I played for a little.  I was very new to Norrath, and she helped me a lot.  She invited me to join her guild, the Fellowship of Justice, and I did, not really understanding what a guild was all about.<br>
<br>
My soulmate, in EQ and RL, Sad Romeo the paladin, had been learning about guilds, and had decided he wanted to become a Knight of the Rose.  I supported him in this decision, as he was given a task he must complete before joining, and I offered to assist him, as it was important to him.  I will not tell his story, however, but mine.<br>
<br>
Sad Romeo’s quest accomplished, we were asked to meet up with Sylune at the Oasis, a place we had not been yet.  We ran there, rather scary for our low level of just 10 seasons.  When we got to the lake in Oasis, there was Sylune and another Knight of the Rose, Molian, and they were engaging a frightful looking deepwater aqua goblin.<br>
<br>
As Sad Romeo answered and went about becoming a Knight of the Rose, I was standing there in awe of Sylune, a high-level cleric and an officer of this guild.  She spoke with me, and was so warm and friendly, that I knew I wanted to be a member in this guild.  To be in the Knights of the Rose, with my beloved Sad Romeo, and to have Sylune, the ideal of my class, was something I wanted very much.<br>
<br>
We spoke, and Sylune made it happen: I became a Knight of the Rose!  I have been a Knight of the Rose ever since, and have loved the heart that members of this fine guild have.  While many have come and gone, all Knights, past and present, are like family to me.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Sylune, for bringing me into this guild!<br>

I think Talmar sent me on a quest before I could join the guild. The Items I had to collect were a Runnyeye warbeads and a putrid rib bone. Unknown to me Runnyeye and Befallen were close by to Freeport. From my ranger character I knew that the beads could be found in Butcherblock and from my flat mate we knew that the bone could be found in Qeynos hill's. I'll tell you this was a scary trip for a person new to Antonica and for the level I was at. After I found the two items and made my way back to the East commons. Talmar and Caseyas (who arrived in the guise of a dark elf) then let me join the Knighs of the Rose. Even though it has been more than a year scine I left I still like to come to the board and catch up.  <p><i><b><font color="Teal">

<br>
/The muffled sound of a throat being cleared is heard<br>
<br>
/Moments later Dresdin saunters in emerging from one of the many shadows cast by the torchs lighting the room<br>
<br>
My journey to becoming a member of the KoTR is quite the long tale, so let us get comfortable yet...<br>
<br>
/Dresdin pulls himself up a stool next to a small table in the corner of the room<br>
<br>
/He sets is gauntlets, helm, and pack heavily down upon the table, which wobbles and strains under the weight - He lays his sheild against the wall behind him, and pulls what seems to be a large cask from one of his packs.  Upon its un-corking a most pungent aroma quickly fills the air.  Almost unbearable, it is most unmistakable among those familar with drinks, this aroma could be nothing else but Ojum's Fierce Brew<br>
<br>
/After taking a pull from the cask, Dresdin grabs a dirty bug from the table, pouring out its remains and giving the glass a quick blow to remove the lingering dirt, he fills it before replacing the cork on the cask<br>
<br>
Ahh, lets see - where to begin...<br>
<br>
I was still young to Norrath when I first heard deeds of the Knights of the Rose, I believe I was still a young lass only 9 or 10 circles of ascention into my training as a ShadowKnight.  It was about this time I first started talking to Animosity and our friend we all simply now call Stan.  My childhood friend, Hopevalore had joined the ranks of their guild and had interduced me to some of them...<br>
<br>
The KoTR was going through a time of change back in those days, and many things were being discussed about the future of the guild and how it would progress.  At this time in my life I was still seeking my own place in Norrath, and had not yet learned if my ways were going to lead me further into darkness or into the light.  My past as a child slave to that human had ran deep scars across my heart, and I knew not if they would ever mend...  So I continued alone...<br>
<br>
A few years later, when I was nearing my 16th circle of ascention as a ShadowKnight, still quite young to this world I believed myself capable of defeating any who stood against me.  It was at this time I met my first KoTR member face to face - only this meeting was not quite as friendly as those interductions of the past.  <br>
<br>
It turns out this member of the KoTR is quite a proud Knight, and holds his honor and his love of his god high on a pedistal.  High enough that when I tried to pull down that pedistal I was quickly met with his sword.  We exchanged many a word that day, many insults to one anothers god till there was nothing more to be said other then what can be spoken with the bladed end of a sword.<br>
<br>
I fought hard, it had been my greatest challenge yet recieved... Me being neive in the world cared not that this Knight had already reached beyond his 25th circle of ascention in his training, he was of a weaker god and a weaker profession - I must be able to defeat him...<br>
<br>
Well after a galent battle that lasted for what seemed an hour he defeated me, and then began to laugh at me as I die... I was so nieve I didn't even relize he was so much more trained in the ways of battle, he had not only defeated me, but had dispatched the famous Grenich gnoll at the same time - winning himself a Polished Granite Tomahawk...  I burnt his name onto my black heart that day, swearing vengance on this Knight name Xanthantos...<br>
<br>
(/ooc I and Xan then roleplayed enimies in-game for the next year or so realtime, always insulting and fighting with each other even when grouped)<br>
<br>
Well some more time past, as it always seems to do, and I was now nearing my 30th level of ascention within the ranks of ShadowKnights...  Hopevalore my childhood friend and various other KoTR members had broken off from the main guild, forming a 'sister' guild 'The Sages of Virtue'...  I had now met many of these people on various adventures, Talmar, Elizabetta, Stan, Maui, Themis, Reidas, etc, etc, etc.... And had started growing use to having their company.<br>
<br>
Tis was about this time, Talmar the leader of the Sages invited me to join their ranks - they had another Darkelf amoung them and were looking for more people of Honor that came from less Honorable backgrounds to join. So I did...<br>
<br>
I then spent the next few years and 10 circles of ascention, raising my ranks withing the folds of the guild.  I had helped a bunch of my fellow guildmates get the remainder of the training to reach their 30th circle of ascention, and even had the honor of tagging along on an adventure in the pits of Nafegens lair, killing Kolbolds, with our fabled Paladin Stan whom had more training then any before him I'd met (the first level 50 i'd seen face to face)...<br>
<br>
Well again time pasted and things changed, more and more of the origanal KoTR that had made up the Sages were filtering back into the KoTR for one reason or another, I had raised to the rank of Highest Officer and Ambasador for the guild, and the fabled Stan had joined the afterlife...  I had fallen back into my solo ways, and was spending most of my time away from those i was suppose to be the closest with...<br>
<br>
(ooc giving somewhere around this part of the story I should go into the big fall out I had with the KoTR, specifically me and Case had words with each other over something that started as a misunderstanding and for a long time I would not even hang with my best online friends at the time - if case was anywhere near - wouldn't group with KoTR members for awhile etc...   But that was stupid stuff of the past - that again started over a misunderstanding in the first place so no need to go to much into it...)<br>
<br>
/Dresdin pauses taking deep pull from his mug...<br>
<br>
This only continued for a short time, it was not long after I had a vision from my god telling me it was time to rest...  I then gave up all my worldly belongings, returned to my birthplace of Freeport and fell into a deep sleep watching the sun set on the horizen...<br>
<br>
(ooc ergo I lost everything i owned due to corpse decay crap and decided it was good time to quit EQ, even cancelled account for few months)<br>
<br>
Upon finally waking years later, I found myself the Highest ranking Sage - in a world were most of the Sages new not even my name.  About that time, another from amoung high in the ranks of the Sages grew petty and started throwing around commands and insults to all those in the ranks of the guild - even those like I who was above him... But due to the influx of new members loyal to this rebel, I felt it best to just remove myself from guild rather then rip apart a guild where I no longer felt I belonged.<br>
<br>
So I set out alone on my adventures again, not much caring what was happening with the differant guilds of Norrath, as I belonged to none...   I would group with friends I had met along the way whom had joined one of many differant guilds, again I started grouping with my friends that had returned to the KoTR, and life seemed to be going well - but still I missed my oldest friends - and even more so those that had gone away...<br>
<br>
/Dresdin pauses taking another deep pull from his mug...<br>
<br>
Then as if to answer my wishes, one of my oldest friends was returned to Norrath, one many of us thought never to see again - Stan was back amoung us...<br>
<br>
He had rejoined the KoTR, who was now without many of the origanal names I had seen from the past - but still many names yet remained - Case and Syl, Molian and Golv, Larel the little one, and Stan the man, there was Justina and Nefitidy (yes and many others we all know - sorry not going to try and think of you all - being left out has nothing to do with how i think of yee)...<br>
<br>
I instantly started making a habit to search out Stan where-ever he was to adventure again with my old friend.  Soon there after, there was a guild meeting being called by the KoTR - It was to be held in ToX and was not to be a closed meeting...<br>
<br>
I figured it a good chance to see many of my friends again, and would put me in the right place so that after the meeting I could supply my friends with bottles for a good ol time...<br>
<br>
/Dresdin gets a large smile across his face as he takes another deep pull from his mug finishing it off...<br>
<br>
Well tis was at that very meeting, both Sylune and Caseyas invited me to join the ranks - making it my choice if I desired it to only to be for the length of the meeting (ergo just for listening ease) but then both made it very clear that they'd both be happy and would welcome me as a permanent member into their guild if I'd so choose...<br>
<br>
I believe it took me only 15 to 20 minutes of seeing so many of my friends talking amoungst each other within the guild to remind me what I had so loved about the Sages when I first joined, and I knew right away I was home...<br>
<br>
So that be my tale...  Hope it not put any of ye to sleep <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

   I was lvl 9 when i decided to join a guild. At the time ALukard was leader and he sent me on some insane quest to retrieve keys from lands all across norrath. I needed to get keys from  Befallen,Unrest, and najena.  This was a nearly impossible quest for me to complete but with the help of  a few people and a crap load of deaths i completed the quest. I grouped with Duldon (heh remember him? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> who also was questing to join the guild. I zoned into GF and gave a tell to Alukard &quot;I got the keys, where ya at ?&quot; Next thing i know *Blewp* a window popped asking  if i wanted to join.<br>

I was new to this world only level 5 when I got my first bow. I knew nothing of the trade skills and how to make the arrows for my bow. At that time the merchants did not sell arrows and if they had I would not have been able to afford them. I knew nothing of grouping with others and had gain level 5 by complete solo play. But now I had my bow and I need arrows as luck would have it a wondering fletcher past through Qeynos hills calling out his skill as a master fletcher. His name was Malery or something to that nature. Thrilled with my luck I shouted out to him. I had gained 1 pp and thought I was rich indeed. He agreed to sell me the arrows I wanted for 7 gold. <br>
Upon getting the arrows I gave this fellow my one plat and he said I am sorry I have no change and logged! I was devasted, how rude, this fellow was, and I had been robbed of the valuable gold that I needed so much. I was determined to get my money back!<br>
The next day I looked for this man, and not being sure of the spelling of his name I found a man Named Marley in the zone. I thouth this was the man who owed me money so I sent him a tell. &quot;Sir you owe me change from the arrows you made for me yesterday&quot; <br>
Marley replied oh I forgot to give you your change, I will be happy to make more arrows for you but you must come to me. I am right now in Splitpaw if you can come here i will be happy to correct the problem.<br>
Where is splitpaw I replied. <br>
Marley gave me direction to South Karana, I was only level 5 but I was determined to get my money back, after all it was THREE GOLD! I had never been outside of Qeynos and Qeynos Hills (except for once entering Karana's and meeting a friendly lioness that quickly ended my exploration) but honning my tracking skills and killing a couple of large bats I bought food for the trip. Running to the Karana zone I held my breath, Hoping there would be no Lions on the other side. <br>
I entered this new world with caution and headed north to the small village I was told would be there. The darkness surrounded me and my gentle candle was all I had to give me light. I found the village but I was afraid that the people there were hostile so I entered the river and started to swim along the edge.<br>
Then I saw two players, one was named Sylly i do not remer the other but I asked her for directions and she told me I was much too young for such a trip, but I was determined. Folling her directions I followed the river when my tracking showed ghouls and skellys. I had never seen a ghould so I needed them to con them, How very red they were, but I need my money so I pushed on. <br>
I slowly picked my way forward sending tells to Marley for directions and I finially found PAW! Marley said stay right there I will be right back I died but am comming now. The wait was not very long as I saw this naked woodelf comming towards me. <br>
Now the money did not seem to mater anymore for this fellow  had nothing and was rushing into this dark cave without anything but his fist! I gave him my sword. And offer the black gnoll cloak I was wearing. I then took out my rusty knife and followed him into the cave.<br>
He had no light and I knew he needed to see. Zoning into splitpaw there was a gnoll standing there I was attacked and barely made it out alive, there I sat waiting for Marleys return. When he returned  he gave me back my sword and my cloak. <br>
He honored me for the gift of my sword and asked if I was interested in becoming a Knight of the Rose. <br>
We talked for a short time after that and then I returned to the land of Qeynos. But here I had found honor, valor, and a friend.<br>
Asytan was the leader of the knights then, I contacted him and spoke in great length. But again I saw honor in this man. Then I met Maui, as a young cleric, who invited me officaly into the Knights. <br>
I did not remain wih the Knights and let the order twice , both for reasons which I felt were justified at the time. I became a member of a larger quild  but my heart still remained with the Knights. Then a small invation was offered and I returned. <br>
<br>
In my youth I met many special people many I still long to see return to the knights <br>
Jesterwolf, Biddo, Asytan, Alukard, Beth, Redias, Hopevalore, Valarose, Xanthalos, Maui, Cattibree, Molian, Themis, Talimar,<br>
Larel, infectious, Teal and so many others. It is a shame that so many honorable players walk the same worlds , hold the same heart and yet do not walk together.<br>
<br>
Today I still rush to Marley, I carry the same heart. And today I stand as a member of the brotherhood , that wish is truley binded by that we call the Knights of the Rose.<br>
<br>
I would also say this to those who have seperated which still come to these pages of time, no mater which quild you have, no mater where you travel, The offer of friendship, botherhood and of Honor still stands here inside this small covenent that which is  The Knights of the Rose. <br>

I always like to 'be' Unilove in all I say and do, and noticed that you are knightly when in Norrath or here.  I remember you as an honorable and noble Knight, very principled, when I was a mere teen in this guild.  There was strife then, and a parting of the ways based on principles, and I did not understand then what was causing the rifts.  <br>
<br>
Still!  Still, here we have you returned to our fold, and Dresdin to join up, and you both are proof that one can rise above grievances, and stand side by side with your fellow Knights and die by their side if that is what is required.  Though I rarely visit the realm these months, I come here almost daily to visit with our guildmates.<br>
<br>
As for your travels, it is a sadness that we will not ever be able to recapture the unknown, the fear we experienced when we were discovering our world and ourselves for the first time!<br>
<br>
I know there are more Knights with unique stories to tell!!<br>
<br>
To those that have shared, I salute you!<br>
To those that have yet to post, I challenge you!!<br>

Forever a Knight of the Rose,<br>

It began many summers ago when my brother and I started our lives in the human town of Freeport. I was a young, brash, inexperienced paladin while my brother was a formidiable warrior (before he converted to druidism as most of you know him). We started our adventure around the Commonlands, running into friends who would remain our comrades for years to come. It is in Commonlands where we met the fabled Alukard, Animosity and Maui(who was a cleric at the time). Soon we grouped often and formed a close bond with one another. <br>
Then my brother decided the road of the warrior was not for him... So he traveled to surfall glade to convert to his true calling-the Druid.<br>
I traveled with him so for awhile, the brothers were seperated from the group. However, after many perilous adventures over the then dangerous lands of Norrath (Highhold Pass was a deathtrap at the time), Talmar and I returned to Freeport and were greeted with open arms by our friends we left behind.<br>
Soon the fold began to increase in number, with the great paladin Sidani soon joining our group to fight the evils of Norrath.<br>
During my travels through the Commonland, I saw a young female paladin bravely standing up to a Griffin, protecting others while sacrificing her own life. Alukard and I immediately asked her to join our group because of her valor and self-sacrifice. This paladin was Angela. <br>
Two others would later join our group-Holyoman and Missdefyu. <br>
After facing many evils in Norrath, Alukard, Talmar and I decided we needed a stronger bond than a mere group to fight these evils... We needed a common banner over our heads so all would know the unity that this group shared. So in (May 1999) the knights of the Rose was formed. <br>
The original members were:<br>
Sidani, Alukard, Talmar, Aystan, Missdefyu, Maui, Animosity, Holyoman(who abandoned/betrayed KOTR immediately-our own Benedict Arnold), Angela and one othe who has long left Norrath when KOTR was formed and remains merely a legend.<br>
I did not wish to bare the mantle of leadership, but it was thrust upon me so I led the KOTR (to the best of my ability) into battle for the first 6 months of our existance. Alukard would later take my place, and after him would come Maui... Until finally Caseyas took the mantle and remained the leader to this day.<br>
Our first recruit (and leader of the monks) was Garrak (who later became better known as Biddo Nator). Then Jhendal, a very kind and honest cleric. Next was Caseyas, who was friends with Holyoman at the time (Holyoman repented and was allowed back into the fold...only to later betray KOTR again!). Sylune would soon join the fold and become our most beloved healer.<br>
And the rest is history...<br>

Congrats Caseyas, noticed your title in your signature...<br>
<br>
I remember some of the ones you mention...Maui, but not as the cleric.  I remember being paid a compliment by a Knight, after keeping my group alive when overwhelmed by sheer numbers, being compared to Maui the cleric.  I took that as high praise.  <br>
<br>
Alukard, a fine Knight in stunning armor...he was the one who extended the quest to my love Sad Romeo that ultimately brought me into this guild.<br>
<br>
It is these unique stories and perspectives that make this guild a real fellowship.<br>
