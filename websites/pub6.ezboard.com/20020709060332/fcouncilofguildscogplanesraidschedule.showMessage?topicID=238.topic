After a slow start in forming groups and getting everyone ported up to hate, we had a wonderful time and were very sucessfull.<br><br>  We started roll-call about noon PST, and i was blow away by the number of people who showed up.  Was a little hectic trying to make groups for 63 people ( i was in group 11 with 3 other poeple!), and with only four wizards to port everyone up, it was even harder cause people who were supposed to be in groups had to wait behind.  The three other wizards ( i was the 4th ) are gaureenteed a place on the FEAR raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ... <br><br>  Break-in was the only time more then 2 or 3 people died at once...  on the way to camp someone was walking on the ground and not on the wall, which pulled some mobs on  them...

People who didnt know that this was my first raid leadership attempt were amazed when they found out it was. <br><br>  We cleared all of the first floor, and some of the 2nd floor, saving the maestro for last.

I have seen too many times on these raids, a wipeout at camp because someone trains camp or aggros the maestro.<br><br>The attack on Maestro was flawless..I don't think we lost one person did we? Again, I agree with you that the raid was very successful because of our main tanks....being high lvl and attentive really helps!!!  Great job pulling as well!! 9hours is a long time to pay attention and they did a great job..my hat is off to them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Overall I had a great time..never been there with that many people in the zone...wow!  So many melee not able to hit the mobs it was funny...

You had enough people there at 10 after 3 to form groups and move up, instead of keeping yourself busy over the next 2 hours adding people to groups who showed up late (and in some cases after you had announced that sign-up was closed)<br><br>I don't want these to seem like complaints, I had a great time (even if we didn't get to the Knights of Innoruuk on second floor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   /sigh the life of a Paladin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br><br>Well done by any standard, exceptional considering it was your first raid.<br><br>Sign me up for your future ones <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>*** EDIT ***<br>I forgot to mention, the loot was a little sweeter than what was listed above, there was a Warrior Bp as well as a bunch of rogue gear that dropped <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=84239" target="_blank">Aramus Maximus</a><BR>Cavalierof 54 Seasons <BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=91734" target="_blank">Brackus</a><BR>Enchanter of 16 Seasons <BR>Officer, Conclave of Steel <BR>Karana Server <BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uaramusmaximus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AramusMaximus</A> at: 2/20/02 2:00:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubriganthe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Briganthe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/19/02 1:03:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.per-astra.com/EQMaps/Gallery/Brig.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of HATE recap</span><hr size=1> Don't get me wrong, I had a great time too, but I have to agree with Aramus on all his remarks.
