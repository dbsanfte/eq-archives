This is my own opinion and I think we should all step back and think about what we have become.<br>
<br>
A guild is trying to grow, a guild is making an attempt at &quot;becoming uber&quot; what problems does that guild face? Trakanon, Sky plane, woushi? Nope, Uber mobs are hardly the problem give a guild with the right size enough time and they can handle it. The largest problem that plagues this server is greed, we are all guilty of it. &quot;Let me roll on that tranq staff because I can sell it and get good stuff.&quot; <br>
However what I am focusing on now is the way this &quot;Big Brother&quot; system works. Now &quot;Big Brother&quot; is supposed to protect you...but big brother also steals from you whatever he wants. If a guild with the right size feels they can do something and KNOWS they can then why should they call? Why should big brother have to act like a vulcher and sit and wait for you all to die and go crying to big brother? Why should big brother say,&quot;Because we didn't get an uber mob we are punishing you.&quot; Really that is all this comes down to Big Brother is never in it to protect anyone Big Brother is only there to help himself. &quot;If this drops this person gets it in return we help you clear this place.&quot; What if help isn't needed? What if someone in the non-uber guild needs this to finish their epic quest too? *Gasp* Its true other people do deserve to do their epic quests too thats why a majority of Epic quest mobs can be taken down by a small guild and end with an EPIC battle. The Big Brother sits and waits for another one of their guild members to get another epic item so that they can be even more uber then the other uber guild(Greed for power). The smaller guild who is growing is then punished with something which can stun its growth(greed for territory). Big Brother makes the rules, and why do we let them? How many admins are their unless its more then 30 Its a load of junk. Why? lets say its 5. 5 people are making decisions for 10,000 players on a server. Did the server vote on who did this? Nope a hand full of guilds got together and decided the rules for the whole server. Why should a guild be forced out at a certain time eastern standard time? What if a guild is made up of mostly Australian players, what if most of the guild players are swedish? It doesn't matter in the eyes of greed because all that matters is how their own guild progesses. <br>
This becomes a breeding ground for hatred, 5 people making the decision for 10,000 is not a democracy it is an Oligarcy which is perhaps 2 steps from being ruled over by a tyrant. Isn't that why we made the Calendar system so that one or 2 guilds wouldn't sit in the planes to get their epic items? Well guess what no matter how long it takes them people eventually reach lv 60 and the uber list gets longer and longer then there is more big brothers there is more greed there is more fighting. Personally, the largest problem is this whole &quot;I'm uber your not and you never will be attitude.&quot; When SoT absorbed a lot of members from Aeon it became a more powerful guild yet because they ran into a snag in PoA every uber guild had its own little rep saying &quot;Oh ooh ooh your not uber your not uber gotta wait another month na na na na na na.&quot; Its sick, Visualize this server as a country and look how its governed the strong destroy the weak as they weak try to gain power. Isn't that right uber guilds? Oh of course its not, maybe when I was a lower level I would have believed you but, Every single guild who has told me,&quot;We refuse to be A-holes like those people in (uber guild)&quot; but, they turn around and just break that promise when the opertunity comes up. <br>
<br>
What's my proposistion to this? The Calendar is a good Idea what I think would be a lot better is for time limit. As a guild posts when they raid they post when the raid begins and when it ends. The 2am standard is biased to americans only not giving any rights to players in other countries. A guild posts Raid will begin at 2pm then they have till 2am to leave because as we all know it takes 12 hours to clear the plane. As an example my guild was kicked out of the Plane because it was 2am. Who cares? It was 2 am sure but the plane would start repoping at 7am that gives us 5 more hours to clear it. Why will people disagree with this? It gives smaller guilds who meet the planar requirements enough time to actually finish off the planar mobs, not giving the Big Brothers ample time to swoop in and &quot;save the day&quot;(and save the epic loots, yah boy woulda been a shame if epic loot fell into the hand of noob guilds.)<br>
<br>
If there was no 2am deadline and only a 12 hours to clear it and yer out. There would have been NO question that we could have finished off cazic. Either way, its the way it is Uber guilds will always oppress smaller guilds in any way they can. Deus Factum came in to claim the plane. Deus factum did not come in and post that Cazic was left up Marcy of KEG(uber guild) did infact only the uber guilds cared. Does it matter? nope not at all, ubers will stay uber and the weaker will grow slowly and have punishments handed down on them whenever they make an advancement.<br>
<br>
I leave you with this final statement to all of you in non uber guilds. <br>
<br>
We all have friends in uber guilds they can be close they can be just people you say hi to. The fact remains as much as they care about you their guild could give a crap about you. Big Brother doesn't care about you, Big Brother just cares that you offer them an easy answer to the &quot;how do we get our god drops and epic quest items.&quot; They will always be there waiting to &quot;help&quot; you but they will also always be there to hold you down as well. <br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

<br>
I will not take the time or effort to repute you point by point; except to say the following:<br>
<br>
1. Please read the posts starting with the oldest before you post.  It will prevent someone like me from saying &quot;please read the posts starting with the oldest before you post.&quot;<br>
<br>
2. This calendar, its rules, and those selected to be admins, are because approximately 25 guilds (or alliances) of at least 40 people have come together and decided to compromise to reach a solution that they could live with.<br>
<br>
The key word is compromise - the largest guilds are not happy (read the BOTS/CIW vs KEG flame war).  The smallest guilds are not happy (see clept/zanthor's posts).  No one *loves* this calendar system.  We follow it for 3 reasons: 1) we do NOT want FFA where the Play Nice Policies are invoked, 2) we do not want a server where only one guild dominates everyone, and 3) it is the *best* solution we could come up with. <br>
<br>
If you have a better solution please post it.  Rember, you must create a solution that can get the support of members of BOTS as well as members of KEG, CIW, MFH, FoR, Freaks, NB, DF, SoT, RoS, Botb, and every other guild that posts here.  You will be supprised exactly how hard that is.  Hell, ask just 5 of them to agree on what time a raid should end and you will get a 20 post discussion.<br>
<br>
This isn't about 5 people oppressing others, this is about the 25 largest groups trying to share with one another, and with anyone else who wants to share back.<br>
<br>
Final thought, the 5 admins do this because we do not want to see the planes go FFA.  This job 1) sucks, 2) is a lightning rod for abuse, and 3) is not fun when making decisions that anger someone no matter how small.</font><P><TABLE background="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/backg.gif"><TR><TD><IMG src="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jrey/elawndarhead.jpg" border=0></TD><TD><P><font color="white">      "You will never become a Knight at this rate"<BR><BR><BR>"Me 'barsh.

<br>
You claim it is all about greed...<br>
<br>
If Legends of Marr had asked for help from MFH or FoR, your leadership would be distrubiting a Dawnfire, Darkwood Trunk, and Shield of Rainbow Hues among it's members.<br>
<br>
Instead, Deus Factum is.<br>
<br>
I understand you guys are upset, and feeling cheated, and oppressed.<br>
<br>
But please take this into consideration....<br>
<br>
Ask yourself if your guild ever would have had that chance if the calendar and it's rules were not in place.<br>
<br>
The uberguilds you're so down on give up far more than they gain from the calendar system. If this calendar was not in place, and we were in full FFA, I promise you that one of the uberguilds would be in fear as soon as the servers came back up and that Cazic Thule would be dead 4 hours later.<br>
<br>
This isn't a threat, it's simply the way things would be... because it's the way things WERE before the calendar went into effect.<br>
<br>
I've had to walk away from Fear with cazic up before, and it left a very bitter taste in my mouth.<br>
<br>
I dunno, this strikes me mostly as a matter of pride (though I've heard rumors of other motivation, I likewise will not comment as I don't know for a fact).<br>
<br>
It plays out like this...<br>
<br>
Your guild agreed to abide by the rules of the calendar. They weren't sprung on you all of a sudden. Complaining about them now doesn't do much good... it looks like a case of sour grapes.<br>
<br>
I understand that you wanted to do it as a guild, but it didn't happen for one reason or another. The best thing y'all can do is talk over why, discuss what can be done to get the goal accomplished the next time. You learn as much from not accomplishing as you do from accomplishing.<br>
<br>
If you don't agree with the rules of the calendar, then you're not bound by law to abide them. Just be certain you're willing to risk the wrath of the rest of the servers community who HAVE agreed to abide by the rules of the calendar.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself this: Who operates in heavier fetters?<br>
<br>
The smaller guild who has the plane all day and yet has to leave because of the time limit in order to not mess up the plane for the group handling the next day....<br>
<br>
Or the big uber guild who could go in, clear the plane in 4 hours, go kill a few dragons as an after dinner snack, and then do the same thing again next week.... but CAN'T because they've agreed to abide by the rules of the calendar. <br>
<br>
Who gives up more and who gains more?<br>
<br>
Trust me, we all have facets of this system we really do not like, but we have to do the best we can within those limitations. Every posting guild is bound by the same rules as LoM, so DON'T ask for special treatment.<br>

Xedd, you think we are greedy now? CIW, KEG, BOTS, MFH and many other can clear Fear Cazic and draco included in 4 hours or less. When we go we brake west wall and we send multiple pullers so they can pull faster. The fight is one constant train. If even 1 of those entities breaks off the calendar and decide to go after Cazic on every patch day and still respect PnP rules - you'd never see Cazic Thule again.<br>

<br>
I'm speaking for myself here, not my guild, but your post brings up our calling MFH in last night, so I'd like to expand on some things.<br>
<br>
Deus Factum is primarily a west coast guild; our raids start at 6pm PST at the earliest, weeknight raids are a big problem for us.  We were pulling Fear with 4 groups, but we had a lot of connection issues, some people went LD and ran off into the zone, some got summoned away, etc.  While we would have made it if things had gone better, and still arguably had a slim shot at making it, we decided to call MFH in earlier rather than later.  We did this not so we could sit back and watch loot being harvested and kick back (and I know you weren't implying this but some will get that impression from your post), but because we knew that after the LoM incident that we were under scrutiny and that many guilds like us would suffer if we did not call in the BB.<br>
<br>
MFH acted through it all just as they should, but calling in a BB is not a fun experience even when both sides act as they should.  Our puller ended up leaving in frustration at having no role to play, one of our enchanters who is close to his epic had to watch someone else take it (ultimately, I'm sure, feeling like we somehow traded away the epic piece he really needed for Cazic's loot instead, although this was not the case), and several of those members who were lost in the zone could not be rescued for many hours because of the pulling pace and camp outs.  This is not MFH's fault, and you probably weren't even aware of it; we did not bring these issues up.  Even as nice as MFH was, there's also the feeling that the other guild is being rescued from something they can't do, which does not feel good for a guild when you know you can take down a god in &lt;4 hours from zone in.  Again, not MFH's fault, we just had bad luck on a night with conditions where we needed a little good luck instead.<br>
<br>
Given the choice, many of us would rather not have gotten the loot at all just to keep our raid intact.  Deus Factum is a guild of integrity and responsibility, and we hold to our agreements.  MFH did also.  I can't say the rule itself is something to be admired.  In this case, it took 2 good groups of people and forced them into an ugly situation.  It's a compromise all right, but I'm not sure it's the best one we can muster...<br>
<br>
Again, even though I've characterized some of what I saw DF going through last night, this is my interpretation only.<br>
<br>
Congratulations and thanks for your help, MFH.</font><P>Gondil Stonefriend<P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugondil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gondil</A> at: 1/26/01 12:22:11 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umortyeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MortyEQ</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede Slavedriver</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>158</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>1/26/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12:41:54 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Oppression, Epics,Ubers The endless waltz goes on.</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Beh... was gonna post a few tired lines from a certain Monty Python skit from &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; but it is less typing not to.

<br>
Xedd speaks for himself on this issue but now i must speak for the rest of the legends.<br>
<br>
We broke the rules of the calendar board. Whether those rules are desirable or not is not the bulk of the matter, the fact is we broke them. Some legends will disagree on certain issues, like Xedd, and there are others and I understand where theyre coming from, but the majority of LoM respect the calendar and the admins that worked so hard to uphold these rules for everyones best interest and understand that no single set of rules will keep everyone happy, but the majority is better than nobody.<br>
<br>
LoM is a family of funloving EQers. The guild was looking forward so much to going to fear on their own. When we heard the servers were going down and realized CT and Draco were gonna be up we were like oMG! A treat for us! Sure this is nothing to the uber guilds as Aegirson shows, but dont you remember the first time you did CT and Draco on your own? But for us we had to come up with strategies, research mobs weaknesses, the best way to pull fear with Gods up, what would happen if we do this etc. We had a helluva lot of fun doing fear on our own and I must admit we aimed pretty high for our first time but given a little more time, we knew we couldve done it without any help. Everyone mustve died at least 15 times from my trains, I myself lost almost 2 bubs of level 60 exp even after resses. Heck some of the guild didnt even want to leave the plane without being DT'd by CT at least once! Out of 60 levels of EQ i never had so much fun in my entire EQ life and the legends felt the same and we got carried away with time.<br>
<br>
The next day everyone blasted us for not calling BB and breaking the rules. Me especially. NOBODY even expected us to even go as far as we did with Draco and CT up and everyone wanted us to fail and as you can see we didnt disappoint. And naturally we retaliate because all we wanted to do is the same reason we play EQ, and thats for fun and to have a blast. Killing CT and Draco alone was our goal. The ph47 l3wts was a bonus. Its a pride thing I dont expect you or anyone to understand.<br>
<br>
What happened happened. I cannot stress this enough. And I speak for myself when I say the mistake was mine and I got carried away and miscalculated what we could do in our time frame. We broke the rules set up. Ilystil, the guild is not expecting special treatment as you claim and I made this clear in my first post. We didnt mean to rock the boat. We just want this issue over and done with. Im tired of level 1 n00b t00ns msging me from EC telling me I suck cuz we didnt call MFH and couldnt kill CT =P<br>
<br>
Rewena, the legends are still awaiting your decision regarding our punishment and have every reason to respect what you have planned for us for we know you to be fair. We have Hate scheduled for the 10th of Feb which we waited patiently for over a month to look forward to and would like to know if this post is still valid. We learn from our mistakes and I can guarantee to everyone who reads this board that we will not make the same mistake twice. Being new to the calendar doesnt excuse us and this is not about excuses. The guild wants to know what happens now. And I need something to tell them.<br>

Anyways I did not write this post as a complaint about the other night. It was only an example I was using. I am sorry if I rubbed anyone the wrong way with this post, it was strictly how I felt and I wanted to put MY opinion out into the discussion board. If you read my post you will see I said I understand and respect the rules and that the only one I had a real problem with was the time limit, due to the fact noone was going to be in fear for a while and it wasn't going to repop for another 3 and a half hours. ONCE AGAIN MY OPINION. Noone in my guild said this to me to type Our guild didn't spend all last night griping about it we did the usual guild stuff as we are still awaiting the result of our actions. Me, myself and I talked to this last night Me said this and I argued with myself some but thats about it. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry big brother guild I didn't mean to offend anyone. I just put my opinion up to discuss. <br>

<br>
There are other people who believe that these mobs are &quot;wasted&quot; whenever a guild that has already killed them a bagillion times takes them down while a guild who has never had the experience doesn't have a chance to.  They know that ultimately it doesn't even matter how many of XYZ item is in the game, since Verant will continue to tune zones and mobs based on the uberguilds' ability to take them down.  They will not move the carrot too far in front of the donkey.<br>
<br>
You tell me which PoV holds truer to the fantasy RPG setting we're all supposed to be playing in.  I know I certainly found it very exciting when Gandalf rooted and nuked his 900th Nazgul in Lord of the Rings.  That was an epic moment.<br>
<br>
Greed is greed.  People can pay lip service all day to all the other rationalizations, but the fact is that certain guilds will always feel that they should get all the loot first.  They don't stop at killing the mob first, or killing it a few times and refining their process, then moving on.  They just kill it and kill it until every single one of their members, their twinks, their closest friends has the loot, or until some other guild makes it too inconvenient or uncomfortable to keep going.  Then they move to next mob, er loot container.<br>
<br>
The BB rule is in place to keep such guilds from totally running roughshod over the server; that is the reason it was created.  It's an appeasement for the gluttony.  <br>

I agree with most of what you say, but the BB  rules are alittle more that just an appeasement.<br>
<br>
Yes, it is an appeasement to the bigger guilds, but also there is a basic logic to it that justifies it on a logical level.<br>
<br>
Warriors in guilds that cannnot clear to the Spiroc Lord in sky (warrior final component) don't really need maestro's hand or the fear golem ball.  The hardest part of this (and most of the epic quests) is NOT the untra rare plane drop - its killing the other junk.  The wariror quest, for example, requires a green and a red scale.  The red scale can be gained from naggy - but the green one from Severlious and Trac(?) only.  The BB system makes some sense because *as a server* we mazimize the number of epic items entering the system.<br>
<br>
Another key part of the BB clause is that *any* group can become a BB guild.  The test of worthiness is a reasonable request.  I don't love the BB system; but at the same time my warrior has no need for maestro's hand.  I don't have the red/green dragon scales and don't expect to even have the chance to loot them any time soon.  Someday I will; but for now I would rather a warrior get it that can use it now.<br>
<br>
If you want to see the way a *true* uber guild acts - here is a good example: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub4.ezboard.com/fafterlife68829afterlifemessageboard.showMessage?topicID=2276.topic">pub4.ezboard.com/fafterli...2276.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  There are guilds on the rathe that might like to say this to the rest of us, but they do not - and I respect them for that.<br>

In fact, how is greed being served, if you don't understand the BB guilds are not getting any of the uber loot, they are simply getting the epic stuff.  I mean cmon, if your guild can't even take down CT or even get to him then you sure as hell aren't gonna be able to take severilous or nag.  <br>
<br>
Like I said in my first post, the BB guilds are providing a service that is helping your guild do what it ultimately wants to do, and all to often they are doing it without any compensation at all, so this is not greed on their part.  My guild has had BB help us with every planes raid we have been on, and I would say less than half the time we have gotten any epic loot they needed to drop, but they still help us clear the plane and we all have a great time.  And about your statement about leaving a god up, the sooner you kill an uber mob the sooner he will respawn, thus making it possible for more people to be able to kill him.  The frikken mobs were put in this game to be killed, and they were given loot to drop, so wtf complain about people killing them, they served their purpose.<br>
<br>
The guilds that are able to post on the calendar knew full well of the rules, and if they don't they need to read over them again.  The rules aren't gonna change because someone doesn't like them, they are there to better serve the whole, not the few.  Deal with it or don't go, it's as simple as that.

<br>
Throwing a hissy fit every time a loot-bearing mob stays spawned &quot;too long&quot; is greed driven, utterly and completely.  Don't fool yourself.  Wanting loot for your circle of friends *to the point that you exclude other people from having any chances* is just as greedy as wanting it only for yourself.  <br>
<br>
Your statement about the rules not changing because a few people don't like them is a little amusing, since the 3 BB's that forced the BB rule into existence are a small minority and they got their way.  In any case, the reason I posted was your attitude and your mistaken beliefs about why the BB rules were compromised on.  Not the rule itself.  I did not call for the rule to be toppled; you made that assumption.  <br>

How many times I have received such over-whelmed smiles and appreciation from the level 2 warrior when I hand them a Fine Steel weapon, or the player I hand quest items to that they would not have been able to gain safely for another ten levels, yet another I tell whom to give what for the easy faction adjustment, and actually give them the stack of bandages (or what have you) to get them started.<br>
<br>
I know I personally have been helped gain that last bub and a half to level and gain the next spells, That was fun. Or how I have received, unbidden,  the Skin of Nature as I was at my last bub of health battling &quot;x&quot; beastie. It was fun battling the red beastie with the group who just happen to have the rare item, and having finally rolled a high number after missing other rolls before. These things are fun. <br>
<br>
Let us not forget where we came from (the naked level 1 character)<br>
<br>
For if we all start thinking less of ourselves and more of others, I guarentee, we all will have much more fun.<br>
