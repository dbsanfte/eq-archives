<br>
&quot;They're all waiting for you to lead them&quot; he said hesitantly.<br>
<br>
The man on the stump raised his hand slowly. In the other an orange butterfly sat resting it's wings.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's not much time.  An evil comes this way the likes of which we've never seen before.  The armies of darkness are uniting to stamp out the light. Your leadership is needed&quot; Askander said, a note of impatience creeping into his voice.<br>
<br>
The weathered figure moved slightly and the butterfly took to the wing &quot;The world has no need of me. My followers have gone their seperate ways. They have forgotten me.&quot; He said quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not all.&quot; Askander replied. &quot;There are some who remember the old ways and wish to return to them.  They look to you to rise up and lead them to greatness once more. This is your chance to once again be a force for good.  Don't let your burdens overcome you.  There is still much work to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have sought me out the world over.  Is there that great of a need?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Though it has been said before the words have never been more true than they are right now: This is our darkest hour! Come with me your sword and wisdom are desperatly needed.&quot;<br>
<br>
The figure laughted cruelly. &quot;Old friend you've never had a way with words.  But by the tone of your voice I can tell you believe what you say.  However how can you be so sure that I can turn the tide?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You alone cannot hope to win the day.&quot; Askander looked into the eyes of the stooped figure with a conviction he didn't know he had &quot;But all are needed.  Everyone, from the greatest Vicar to the lowliest Ranger after his first day of initiation into the jagged pine, is needed to stem this tide of darkness.  But in order to win against such chaos there must be voices that strike out in the night to bring order to our ranks.  I believe you to be one of those voices.  You can make the difference.  This ragged band of leftovers, myself included, still believe in you. I know that you at one time, however long ago, believed in yourself.  I'm asking you to once again lead your troops into battle and with a bit of luck, and the blessing of the gods that will listen to us, we will win the day.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well&quot; the figure said with a tired sigh &quot;what will the others say? Those that I have left behind.  Undoubtedly they will feel abandoned&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They might, but as I said, all arms are needed and the heat of battle makes strange allies.  Many an old transgression can be undone by the deeds of the present.  Keep your eyes on the destination.  Not those things that would make you stumble and keep you from the prize. Our world as we know it lies on the brink.  Come old friend we shall endure these times and make the world a better place for those that come behind.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the two strode silently from the glade an orange butterfly dissapeared in a flash of light... <p>Askander <BR>

<br>
&quot;Late as usual.&quot; said a tall rugged figure as he clenched his mace in frustration. &quot;Probably lying dead in a snow drift, the victim of a gnoll ambush. I should have gone with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wamor, he's wandered this world for some time.  Give Askander a little credit&quot; said a distinctly female voice. &quot;Besides Balamorm's with him and if I know my husband they're late cause there was an emergency at the local tavern!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah yes Aloynia&quot; said the bard, Valtar &quot;Your hubby is known for his love of good spirits. And has been known to turn the head of pretty barmaid or two&quot;<br>
<br>
Aloynia turned on the bard, staff in hand &quot;My husband is true to me half-elf.  Watch your tongue or I'll pull it from your mouth and watch it for you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Settle you two&quot; Gaikutsu said interposing himself between them. &quot;There is no honor to be gained in this pointless bickering.  Besides it's too cold for such antics.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sethatign shifted uncomfortably. &quot;This is a far cry from our glory days.&quot; picking up a stick he poked at the small fire sending embers leaping into the air. &quot;Our strength has waned&quot;<br>
<br>
A small dark figure sat down next to him. &quot;Worry not Seth. Konatsu will always be around to aid you.  What more strength do you need than my dark powers?&quot;<br>
<br>
As Sethatign turned to stick out his tounge at the Dark elf a figure stepped into the light and all turned to face it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Askander!&quot; Wamor growled &quot;Bout time you got back here, but where is he?&quot;<br>
<br>
Askander turned as another figure walked into the circle. &quot;Bruin!&quot; many exclaimed as the small crowd gathered around the Ranger.  There were handshakes and slaps on the back and many a greeting.<br>
<br>
Bruin called for order.  &quot;Friends dark times lie ahead.  And while I hid from them you have shown to me that hiding is not an option.  With the estrangement of my wife and the loss of hope I thought to hide in the forests of Faydwer and lose myself to the world and it's goings on.  However that is not to be.  We must gather the loyal to us once again and call into account the forces that would despoil our lands.  We will once again ride for and let evil know that the Maruaders will not stand idly bye while our homes are burned and our loved ones killed.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Bruin's speech went on to cheers and rallying cries.  However two sets of ears were intent on another conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Askander, where's my husband?&quot; Aloynia said pensively.<br>
<br>
&quot;Caught in the passes up in the old kingdom of HighHold. The pickclaw clan of goblins are becoming restless up there.  We thought to have a peek at their goings on and were ambushed.  Your husband is the reason we are here safely.  He stood alone against the goblin tide.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But where is he?  Are you saying he's dead?&quot; Aloynia furrowed her brow in a menacing look that Askander had seen her give her husband many times before.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not know.  Your answers like in the mountain pass.  I intend to travel there myself to investigate further.  Why don't you accompany me and we can search for the answers to both our questions together.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Askander, if you've gotten my husband killed I will never forgive you!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Bruin, noticing their hushed conversation broke from the festivities of the small band and approached the pair. &quot;Balamorm eh? Worry not lady your hot headed husband is probably feasing on goblins tonight&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish I could have your confidance on the matter Bruin&quot; Aloynia grumbled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bruin,&quot; Askander said &quot;Aloynia and I are going to the pass to seek Balamorm out.  We'll meet up with you in the common lands after we finish there.  Hopefully we will be able to bring you news of the pickclaws as well as a healthy barbarian warrior&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good. Till we meet again friends.&quot;  With that Aloynia and Askander set out into the cold... <p>Askander <BR>

High Hold Pass rang cold this time of year reminding him of the distant plains of Everfrost his native home.  Unfortunatly this was no Everfrost and his enemies were numerous.  This thought brought him back to the present and the danger at hand. He had narrowly escaped the original trap in the pass and his heroics had given Bruin and Askander time to escape.  However the tide of goblins was too great and he had been certain that death had finally caught up to him.  However a group of wandering townsfolk from highkeep had wandered by and been drawn into the conflict.  Seeing, though, that the small force from the keep was not sufficient to defeat the little green menace and having already sustained many injuries, Balamorm used the insuing chaos to hide himself in a crevice in the canyon wall promptly falling into unconciousness.  Sometime later he awoke and stumbled out of his hiding place.  The next few days were spent fighting, running, bandaging, and hiding. Now Balamorm was tiring.  The fighting was wearing him down and to top it off somewhere along the way he had become lost.  Sighing Balamorm continued down the path he had chosen yesterday leading down (hopefully onto the vast karanas plains).  Rounding a bend Balamorm came upon a small rabbit caught in the trap.  The animal was dead but only recently and Bal quickly made the decision that the furrier would not miss one rabbit. However, as he tugged the animal out of the trap he heard a large sproing! as he was uncerimoniously dumped into a small pit.  The pit was not deep however the fall had broken a leg.  As Balamorm tried to stand and reach the ledge a pair of heads (topped with pointed ears) peeked over the ledge. As he reached for something to throw at the pair he was broght short by a bow pointed straight at him. Resigned to his fate Balamorm watched as the Goblin slowly drew back his bow... <p>Askander <BR>

Suddenly an explosion at the rim of the pit rained down dirt on him.  When Bal opened his eyes again and looked up the goblins were nowhere to be seen.  A voice spoke at him from above.  <br>
&quot;You're not a lion.&quot;  A hand reached down and pulled him out of the pit by the collar of his breastplate.  Balamorm squinted in the mid afternoon son as a rather large troll came into focus.  <br>
&quot;Right.  This is about on par with my luck lately.&quot; The troll looked at him questioningly. <br>
     &quot;Look&quot; Balamorm said &quot;if your going to kill me can you do it quickly? I'm kinda in alot of pain here and don't really have the patience to deal with this anymore.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why would I kill you?&quot; the troll opened his mouth to say something else then seemed to think better of it.  They stared at each other for a few seconds before the troll said matter of factly &quot;I think we got off on the wrong foot. My name is Kuraz, and I will be your rescuer today.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Uh huh&quot; Bal said not believing this was happening to him &quot;You know you're not like most of the trolls I've ever met.  Of course most of the trolls I've met want to tie me down on a spit and roast me alive.&quot;<br>
    &quot;That's disgusting.  Look I'm not like those trolls cause I'm not those trolls.  I was actually raised by some really nice farmers in the plains here.  After I got a little to big for them to handle they turned me loose on the world.  I've found that hunting around here is kinda fun and spend my days wandering the plains helping out where I can and generally living off the lands.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Fair enough I suppose.&quot; Bal said. &quot;Look you mind helping me up to the keep in the pass? I'm a little banged up.&quot;<br>
     &quot;No can do.  The goblins have the pass all up in arms and the guards aren't too fond of me. But you can stay at my place, I'll bandage you up and you'll be feeling better in no time.&quot;<br>
     &quot;So coincidentally  what was that explosion I heard earlier?&quot;  Bal said as he and Kuraz slowly wended their way down the path.<br>
     &quot;Gnomish fireworks&quot;<br>
     &quot;I've never seen fireworks that worked quite like that.&quot; Bal said skeptically<br>
    &quot;Well this gnome I ran into said they were a little strong and prone to go off at odd times.  I use them mostly for fishing but they come in handy at other times too.&quot; Kuraz said grinning from ear to ear as the two wended their way down the path and out of sight.<br>

<br>
And so too was the plague (attibuted to him) ravishing the Karanas plains.  Askander knew soon after entering them that there would be trouble.  However he had no idea of the scope of it.  Now lying on the ground, feverish and barely conscious his only thoughts were of how foolish he'd been to run head first into territory claimed by the enemy without a plan.  Aloynia spoke to him through a haze, but her words made no sense.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've found a Wizard to take us out of here&quot;  Aloynia said trying to pierce the fog in Askander's mind.<br>
<br>
The blue robed wizard stepped up next to her, placing a hand on her shoulder.  &quot;It's no use and the longer we stay the worse it will become.  We must move quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're right Cumladarn. Let's go.&quot;  <br>
<br>
With a flash of light the trio blinked out of the nightmare of hate and poison.<br>
-----------<br>
Askander opened his eyes and immediatly regretted it.  With a groan he rolled over.  Or at least attempted to his body managed not more than a twitch or two.<br>
<br>
&quot;Careful&quot; said a voice &quot;You're still weak&quot; <br>
<br>
Askander braved another peek from underneath heavy eyelids.  &quot;Am I alive?&quot; he croaked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Barely.&quot; said the voice &quot; The northerner got you hear in the nick of time.  You were barely alive and it took all the priests of Marr to bring you back from the brink.  Rodcet must surely smile upon you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Askander smiled at the mention of Aloynia.   &quot;Where is she?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gone I'm afraid.  After you stabalized, she said she could wait no longer to find her husband. She left in quite a hurry, I might add.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've got to go after her&quot; Askander said as he tried to push himself up off the cot.  However he failed miserably and colapsed in a heap of body parts and blankets.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you'll be going nowhere for a while, friend.  Your companion seems strong.  Have faith that she will be ok.  It is you I'm worried about.  This plague has left a taint in you that I cannot begin to guess about the implications of.&quot;<br>
<br>
Askander finally looked at the voice directly.  The cleric was a man old and stooped.  &quot;My name is Justineous.&quot; he said guessing at Askander's thinking.<br>
<br>
Askander was about to ask another question when the strain of exertion caught up to him and darkness enfolded him.  The last thing he heard was Justineous saying &quot;Rest. We have alot of work to do, you and I.&quot; <p>Askander <BR>
