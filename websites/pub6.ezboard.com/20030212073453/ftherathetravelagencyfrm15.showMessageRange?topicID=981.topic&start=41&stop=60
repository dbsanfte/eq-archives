<br>
First off, <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>well, rest assured, 56 NB won’t wipe to a Taskmaster + adds (which is double the number your leadership claimed wiped to a Taskmaster). Since we all know that Taskmasters are a 1-2 group killable mob *at most*, and each one is in their own location – one would be hard pressed to pull a train of TMs capable of killing 28 of Rathe’s finest mafia hitmen.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What?  Who the hell told you that 28 FK wiped to a Taskmaster?  I should like to talk to this person, and see what crack they were smoking because I remember no such thing..  Maybe I was asleep tho but that doesn't compute.  Anyway...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Tindi only ever tried AoW on their Statue, with the exception of their first kill. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Blah lots of threads on this already lets not belabor it too much - but I must say that standard is far easier to uphold when there are 3-4 guilds on the statue rotation than NINE.  I was a fan of waiting 1 AoW cycle per attempt as it was fair to the participants of the AoW rotation, but since I know of no incident of a statue guild being overrun for AoW (I have actually heard tell of guilds already ON the rotation breating down the necks of guilds that were getting on Vindi/Statue hurry the hell up and get out of their way) I don't know if that is called for.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So if our plate consists of only G/E/C, and FK is pulling a bunch of stalling BS by killing single TMs to prevent the spawn, while sitting on three rotation mobs (ST, Yelinak, and Dozekar), then you’re right, I’m not going to be amenable to backing off our turn when asked as I login.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We never confirmed the spawn of Yelinak.  ST - well you passed it to us why didn't you keep it &quot;on your plate&quot;.  All of the keyed members on that day had the drops they need, so we passed as well.  Dozekar - Again I believe him to be on an irregular spawn timer, and was not confirmed to be up yet.  <br>
<br>
We did kill your TM's to stall, call it frustration.  You need not expect that behavior again.  We did NOT attempt to stall Tindi, a couple members got jumped by the wandering warden when watching all the TL funnel out of the tube, and we did kill him.  Realizing what happened, a TL member commmented &quot;dude you just started the cursed cycle&quot;, to this I replied &quot;yes we did&quot;.  I can't lie and say I was sorry, who cares they were not held up.  There were already enough TL there to pursue G/E, while FK did not have the numbers.  We asked for a stay on him, TL declined, we said glats on your g/e/c.  There was no more to it.<br>
<br>
You do have the right to race back if raced against, I guess I am just naieve in expecting others to handle rotation mobs  the way we do.  If we are up for a rotation and look to the zone and see &gt; 20 of another guild where we were going, we don't go lean on them to make sure they have an immediate killing force, we try to find a different target.  We don't lay a trip on them for not asking, we wish them luck and secretly hope that they fail and die miserably <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>why don’t you guys work on getting more primal and being able to clear all of N ToV, instead of leaving up Vyemm, Koi, Mirenella, the triplets and twins and then complaining there are no raid mobs? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As someone who was up until 4am on the 2nd day of our &quot;turn&quot;, I have to respectfully say:  Fuck you for that dig.  We did all that we could, and we would have came back the next day but we respected the great COMMUNITY STANDARD and called it a game.  Sorry if we lost 3 hours learning how to pull the triplets, only to be so surprised to get a single that we wiped to Zlexak due to noone being prepared - it had nothing to do with lack of primal, I assure you.  Oh did I mention that we only get a shot at NTOV once ever 4-5 weeks?  Please try another excuse.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>First, getting into Tactics takes killing the Behemoth, which, once failed by guilds like LoM, LoL, FK, SotE, Tindi, or NB is wasted for 5 or 7 days. This happens on patch day, and we have always made it a habit to do our rotation mobs first, then seek out new content, out of respect for the rotation system<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I hope you are making a comment about a certain calibre of guild, and not an accusation that we have blown Behemoth spawn.  We have yet to try him, fyi.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>KSing King Tormax<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Take it to the grave, we expected it as soon as we realized our mistake.  Obviously we did this because we wanted to have you rub your balls in our face every time a disagreement arises...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why do you guys let your leaders think acting like sneaky ninjas is the cool thing to do? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think they are tired of reading passive-agressive filibusters, /shrug.  I agree that this is not productive, and its a point being emphasized by myself at the least.  They are proud, and it hurts that pride to have to get permission to try to do something in a video game.  I cannot fault them, but we both agree that it doesn't seem to be working out for us so well.  Time to play ball I guess, the mafia is running out of surprises..<br>
<br>
And let me share with you a big gut feeling I have, you are free to correct me if I am wrong.  NB had an okay time bargaining for rotations because it was just NB.  Meanwhile FK is part of the &quot;booming middle class&quot; (FK/LoM/VoF/SotE/LoL) and it is no secret that once FK can do a mob, many of these guilds are also capable of it.  Letting a guild onto one of these rotations means letting 3-5 guilds onto this rotation, and this really cuts into the relatively fast turnover on spawneds of highly desirable mobs, like say CURSED in particular since this is our favorite discussion piece of late.<br>
<br>
I just want to re-iterate the fact that I WANT us to cooperate on these mobs, it would be a lot easier.  But I don't expect the cooperation that has been touted as so easy to ask for.  You guys are looking out for your interests and I don't fault that - but as a result I fear there is always going to be an excuse.  I'll look to my guild to try to play your game, but if we find noone is returning our vollies we have little choice than to turn to our bastardly lies and deceit, do we?<br>

<br>
<br>
Fact:  FK followed the rules of RTA by announcing that we have the forces in Ssra and are attentping G/E.<br>
<br>
Fact: Karadin logs in, sees 41 FK in Ssra, is told in RTA that we are going to attempt the mob, and STILL CALLS IN NB TO SSRA.  By the time the server went down there were 21 NB in ssra, in the basement despite the fact that in RTA channel I specifically asked for NB not to come down to basement and lag out our attempt like you did on the XTC.<br>
<br>
Fact:  Karadin vows in RTA to play hardball against FK.<br>
<br>
Fact:  Within a day or 2, a ruling appears on the RTA board about guilds attempting AoW only on their statue rotation.  This is despite an &quot;agreement&quot; reached prior to that that guild attempting to join the rotation can only do so once per AoW rotation turn.  The only guild left attempting AoW at that point is FK (VoF killed on that day, and had to fight through the BS to be put on rotation).<br>
<br>
Fact: On the Vindicator that you are referring to, there was another guild attempting him BEFORE us.  Since you had NO problems allowing them to take a shot at him, why should you have problems with us killing him?  We checked with the guild that was attempting to kill Vindi if they were done, which they were and we moved in for the kill.<br>
<br>
Fact: Noble Blade has neglected to update some of its kills, particularly AL.  Is it to prevent other guilds from knowing when the next spawn will be?<br>
<br>
Fact:  FK has inquired about rotations in Ssra templed, and was told repeatedly that no we will not be allowed to attempt the mobs... At this point in time, the only option left is to race.<br>
<br>
Fact:  CT rules were never posted on RTA prior to the incident that you mention.  The ONLY rule that was posted was that guild attempting to go for CT can't over run the guild that has Fear scheduled.  At no point in time did FK over run the guild in fear, and we were given clearance to zone in (Btw, this was already revisited in another thread)<br>
<br>
Fact:  I have asked repeatedly for ALL rules to be posted, so the BS of throwing our hidden rules will stop.  Yet this keeps happening still.<br>
<br>
Fact:  The &quot;punishment&quot; for taking a mob out of rotation was NOT enforced previously, was made up on the spot because it was FK, and because it was NB that KT was taken from.  I have a feeling that had it been any other guild on either side of that equation, then something would have been worked out as it was previously done in such occasions.  But because it was NB and Karadin vs FK, Karadin got what he wanted.  Btw, I respectfully ask that the words SOME GUILDS be bolded in that ruling, to correctly show that not all guilds were in on the decision.<br>
<br>
Fact:  The decision made about KT effects the WHOLE Rathe community, yet was reached by only a few selected individuals.<br>
<br>
There are more interesting facts that I can bring up about our run-ins with NB, but I think I have stated enough.<br>
<br>
What I don't understand is this... Karadin and I used to on pretty civil terms even despite some of the more questionable run ins, yet over time I think that Karadin's hate of one out of the 3 GLs of FK got the better (or should I say worst?) of him...  So now instead of making it vs a person, he made it vs guild.<br>

To answer you :<br>
<br>
FK Rep in the RTA channel Said &quot;We were attempting G/E Cycle but wiped out to a Task Master with a Massive AE&quot;<br>
<br>
Thundaron chimed in &quot;yea one TM does have an AE&quot;<br>
<br>
Karadin &quot;I dont remember an AE but I will trust Thunds word&quot;<br>
<br>
FK Rep &quot;Trust me if we didnt wipe to the TM we would be doing the G/E cycle , we arent stallin &quot;<br>
<br>
Karadin &quot;How many FK are in the zone&quot;<br>
<br>
FK rep says &quot;16 now but we just wiped have 28 and alot more on the way, sucked that we wiped out&quot;<br>
<br>
So to answer your question, your (FK) Leader ship in the RTA channel said that FK wiped out to a TM that takes 1 group to kill.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>FK followed the rules of RTA by announcing that we have the forces in Ssra and are attentping G/E.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No you didnt , well not entirely, every guild except FK has asked atleast 24hr's prior to entering a rotation to attempt a mob, FK has been extremely effective of NOT communicateing, for what reason I dont know because I know LOM/VOF and other guilds can tell you gettin on a rot is pretty easy if you SPEAK to the guilds<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Fact: FK has inquired about rotations in Ssra templed, and was told repeatedly that no we will not be allowed to attempt the mobs... At this point in time, the only option left is to race.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Never done this to anyone in EQ but you sir are a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> LIAR </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
NO one can , or will tell you fk or any other guild they cannot enter a rotation , Guilds can say no not this time if you ask them to try a certain mob , but no one can tell you that you wont be allowed to kill a mob, I am in the RTA channel every day and I never heard such a blatant lie from someone who claims to be a person of importance in a guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Fact: I have asked repeatedly for ALL rules to be posted, so the BS of throwing our hidden rules will stop. Yet this keeps happening still.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yea and all the rules you &quot;dont know about&quot; are talked about repeatedly with Jurrasic yourself and other Reps in the RTA channel who are invited, yet you always seem to &quot;forget them&quot; when you attempt a mob, rest assured the rules for every mob and rotation are being hashed out and posted.<br>
<br>
And I like to remind everyone rules of rotation mobs are only made by participent(sp) guilds, Guilds/persons not actively on a rotation have no say.<br>
<br>
The only rotation that everyone has a say on is The Calendar, Rotations themselves are agreements between guilds to not run eachother over.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Fact: The &quot;punishment&quot; for taking a mob out of rotation was NOT enforced previously, was made up on the spot because it was FK, and because it was NB that KT was taken from. I have a feeling that had it been any other guild on either side of that equation, then something would have been worked out as it was previously done in such occasions. But because it was NB and Karadin vs FK, Karadin got what he wanted. Btw, I respectfully ask that the words SOME GUILDS be bolded in that ruling, to correctly show that not all guilds were in on the decision.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
WRONG, NOT A FACT, 1 or 2 weeks prior to this event BOTS &quot;messed up&quot; on the G/E/Cursed rotation and was assest one full cycle of that mob, and Again rules and Punishments for rotations are made by the guilds involved, if all guilds in the rotation agree on a punishment (not includeing the guild being punished) to bad so sad.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Fact: The decision made about KT effects the WHOLE Rathe community, yet was reached by only a few selected individuals.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
WRONG again, it onyl effects the guilds on the rotation, as this punishment is in that rotation not all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There are more interesting facts that I can bring up about our run-ins with NB, but I think I have stated enough.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Really, I for one would like to hear them! <br>
I could also add the numerous complains about FK I hear from NB, BOTs, LOM, VOF and numerous other guilds who find your general lack of respect and rhetoric to be most insulting, I would recommend FK take a look on how most of the other guilds get on rotation and follow there example because sooner or later your going to piss off to many guilds and when you do get asked to be on a rotation it wont be respected and you will have no support.<br>
