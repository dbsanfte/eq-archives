I'm very disappointed in SoTs choice of actions that took place, but for that I will not hold those actions against my friends. A tag is a thing that symbolizes a guild, and sometimes that tag is tarnished by the mere accident of taking someone else's mob or by anything on that means wrong, even if intentional or accidental. A friendship is something that you form with a person that at some point that little floaty object means nothing to you and only see the tells from a friend. <br><br>If someone is willing to throw away a friendship and that person had nothing to do with this incident and was not even on, or was on and just exping or doing tradeskills, then you don't deserve the friendship of anyone. You inability to look past a mistake makes you more shallow and naive than some of the stupid idiots on the Rathe. Moreover, don't blame those who weren't there and break off a friendship over a floaty thing above one's head. (This applies to every situation when stuff like this occurs, not just this present incident.)<br><br>Another side note, those talking about KSing mobs from SoT, you won't make yourself any better than what they have just done. It won't give you an redemption for whats taken place, or give you the vengence you want. <br><br>My personal solution: SoT help Trompen camp Ragefire. I know he took alot of time out of his life for this epic item. Return the favor even if it was a mistake.<br><br>PS I too had a problem with SoT once, and insults were sent my way. One of those persons was listed on the who. But I forgive and forget...<br><br>Love,<br>Nellryn Neca`Ragno (55th)<br>The Rain Magess<br>&quot;Always the nuetral person between her friendships&quot;<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulilubo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lilubo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tad-pole</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/25/02 9:04:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=473.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Differance Between Tags and Friendship</span><hr size=1> /applaud<br>beautifully said Nellryn /tear forming at corner of his eye <p>Lilubo Ak'Bar56 Revenant Troll"I am the TAUNT KING!!

The mistake was made by Shei and Shei should make the amends. Nyca bashing is wrong. she has done alot for the Rathe and she is a hard working person and I personally know her to be honest and sincere. Those that split from SoT, Dwall and Gal I have known for a long time and know them Scottish folks pretty good. They have high morals and for them to make the leave was hard but for them I think is fair. Lets all wait and see what Shei does. Thundaron has stated thigs are in the works and if you can trust anyone trust him. As for the whole mess Shei made the call and it was terribly wrong. When things done wrong happen like this for our server its only natural for folks to jump the whole guild.

Deaksun[SoT] tried to enforce the PnP on Daserach last night on the Emperor in the Crypt while he was in /ooc spewing crap about LoL just because that was his &quot;Tag&quot;. Of course, the zone [including me] stood up for Das and the camp he had for several hours. People [Including me] Bashed Deaksun saying remarks such as &quot;As if Rage Fire wasn't enough&quot; etc. And what lead to all these insults? Yep you guessed it, the so-called &quot;Tag&quot; which you refer to as a &quot;closed chat channel&quot;.<br><br>Now I do agree that friends should remain friends especially when times are bad. Who else better then me knows what it feels like to be hated by a bunch of people? Even with all that’s happened I still managed to keep ALL my old friends from my last guild where all the problems originated from. H'ell, they have even joined us on several raids and they choose to go anon. Why do you ask yourself again? Because of there &quot;Tag&quot; that’s why. So my point is that your &quot;Tag&quot; is NOT just a closed chat channel.<br><br>I know exactly where this is going to lead so I'll just defend myself once again /rinse and repeat and forget about &quot;history&quot;.<br><br>Many people frown on me because I reported my account stolen to get it back.<br>Do guild leaders usually practice not letting people that have quit playing and decide to come back have there accounts back?<br>Well Yes, I asked to get it back and was told no.<br>I asked to buy it back and was told no.<br>When push came to shove I gave ample warning both via e-mail and on RTA what I was going to do and a couple of weeks later I got my account back thanks to Vaylin.<br>And for the record I gave back ALL tradable items to people I saw fitting with a small note telling them to do with it as they wish before the guild leader hoards it for herself.<br>She had over two weeks to destroy all no drop gear, remove all tradable items, and level my toon back down to 59. She could have deleted my account all together, but she decided to call my bluff and lost. Not once did she ever send me a tell after the fact, but decided to keep the rants going on RTA hoping to satisfy herself &quot;trying&quot; to keep me from joining any respectable guilds and failed once again. I have no idea if the items ever got distributed back to the guild or if the people took advantage of the situation and just dissolved the items through trades either way she can hunt them down from her own guild mates because that’s where they went.<br>Again this isn't about me. I'm just wise enough to know what happens next after I post. So flame on all you greedy, bitter people have just helped me validate that I am the original owner of my toon. <br><br>Hugs and kisses to you all<br>Thanks again,<br> <p>Xienna Esselarre The Rathe Warlord                                League of Levity</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udingbitz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dingbitz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/25/02 11:20:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=473.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.patriots.com/images/header_new/champs_milloy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Differance Between Tags and Friendship</span><hr size=1> Have to agree I am friends with Kikiana from SoT in a semi RL way ..

In some cases it stands for roleplaying, in others for powergaming.

To stand up for yourself and do what you know is right is many times much harder than just going along with the crowd.  If you were there for the RF incident, you consented and condoned it, otherwise you wouldn't have been there.  As so many people point out, this is a game.  If someone is asking you to do something that compromises your principles, simply don't do it.  If this is truly a game, your principles will be much more important than some guild tag over your head. <p><p><P><center><TABLE border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#000000" bordercolorlight="#808080" bordercolordark="#000000"><TR>	<TD>		<TABLE>			<TR>				<TD>				<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">				<center>				<A href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Gromm">Gromm Shatterspine</A><br>				Officer<br>				<A href="http://www.drow.org">Blood of the Spider</A><br>				</center>				</font>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD>					<CENTER>					<A href="http://www.drow.org">					<img src=http://www.drow.org/images/spid.gif>					</A>					</CENTER>				</TD>			</TR>		</TABLE>	</TD>	<TD width="70%">		<TABLE>			<TR>				<TD>				<center>				<A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>				</center>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD>					<center>					<A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">					<IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/8.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?

I am not against selling your account.  I think it's perfectly fine as long as you do it the right way.  Give back the guild what you can, as it's not fair to them to make money off of their hard work .. and don't pull the bullsh'it you pulled.<br><br>You basically sold/gave away the account.  Hence, It was NO longer yours.  You let this guy/girl equip you and level you AND give you 100 bucks and you turned around and took it back.  You should of e-mailed em and asked if you could buy it back .. If you got no response or a no answer, then you should of dropped it.  What you pulled is f'uckin ridiculous<br><br>Personally, I think you need your a'ss beat. <p><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/lohkisig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulohki.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lohki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/25/02 12:39:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=473.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.noble-blade.net/images/lohkihat.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Differance Between Tags and Friendship</span><hr size=1> And for those who take words at face value ..

So with that in mind there was no reason for the person to send you money other than a gesture of 'Thanks' so to speak correct?. But the problem is, you accepting the money as a 'Thanks'. <br><br>Im sure lawyers around the world have argued just this type of scenario on many many occasions lol.<br><br>If i give you something, and you give me money in return as a thanks, without me asking for the money, and then i dont offer to give the money back straight away but decide to wait a while and at a later date decide  *Hey i want my item back i dont need this money* and try and go from there, do i have any rights to my old item?<br><br>Lets be honest here, you *gave* 2 accounts to someone, they decided with the kindness of their heart to send you $100 for your generosity. Then at a later time, you decided you wanted back your accounts and tried to send the money back, the person whom you had given them to refused to hand them back as they had equipped and leveled them even. So you then decide that knowing the EULA doesnt support account trading, to use this as a scare tactic to get the accounts back and even go so far as to have the passwords reset thus in effect regaining control of the accounts. So now you got the accounts and the $100 dollars.<br><br>whose to blame? in my opinion your no better than a common thief, not only did you take someones money and not even attempt to return it initially *read: when they first handed it you* but you kept it for a while. then at a later date decided you wanted the accounts back so you had VI change the PW's back, when the heat got turned up, as a gesture of kindness you offer to return the monies you had recieved. But your not the sole blame here, the person you *Gave* the accounts to is as much as fault as yourself for ever entering into such a deal with someone of low morales as yourself, they are to blame for being so gullable to believe in your honest and also for having faith in VI's account system.<br><br>Basically you screwed someone up the ass for a free $100, some exp and items. Doubt you lose sleep over it tho, you dont stirke me as the kinda person who would show any remorse to this kinda act, maybe you should hook up with SoT? <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><imgsrc="http://http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/10395.jpg"><br><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.noble-blade.net/profiles/Falconus/falcsig3.jpg"><br></a>Falconus<br>Knight of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16862">Profile</a><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a> </p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=473.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=473.topic&start=41&stop=54>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=473.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=473.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=473.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=473.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=473.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=473.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=473.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm10">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm22">The Town Newspaper<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm42">Ragefire<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencytactics">The Town Tavern<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Adiminstration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Posting Status<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm28">Post for Changes<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm27">Trakanon<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm29">Cazic Thule<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm30">Sev <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm31">Zland<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm33">Tormax <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm34">Statue <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm36">Klandicar<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm37">Sleeper's Tomb<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm38">Dain<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm39">Yelinak <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm40">Thought Horror OverFiend<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm43">Dozekar<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Guild access requests</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#FFFF00> -
