The 763 &quot;registered members&quot; are only the people who post on this board.   SoT has about 80 Planes Ready folks, of which only about 4 post here.  So forget that 763 figure all together. <br>
<br>
For each Posting Entity that you have, multiply that by about 40.  <br>
<br>
So, 40 * 40 = 1600.<br>
<br>
And that's only counting 40 Planable to get Posting Privileges, so the actual figure is much more than that.  <br>
<br>
THAT'S the number of people on the Rathe who agree to this Calendar. <p>Nycah Aries'Syrensong<BR>

<br>
Jamany, if you train someone, steal their kills, scam them at the bazaar, ruin their gameplay in any fashion, or just piss them off in general....how do you EXPECT them to treat you?  I'ld like an answer to this please. <br>
<br>
&gt;Also, as to the numbers, with over 3000 people on the server 762(give or take 10 people) is a drop in the bucket. So not everyone is seeing the entire picture because they are not seeing the rules and the debates about the calender system. Just what they are being told by others.<br>
<br>
I don't see 25 percent as a drop in the bucket, maybe 5 percent, but I digress.  In any case by the time you lvl a char up to 46 (which I believe is what you need to be to enter the planes)you are more than aware of the Calendar system and if your not agreeable to all the rules I'm sure that they know where to go to post against them, just like you do.  I mean how DID you find out about this site and the calendar Jamany?  Blind luck using a search engine?  Or was it more likely someone in-game told you about it?  In either case I don't understand the point you are trying to make.  Your argument is invalid, has no direction, and very few facts.  I think I have addressed every issue you put forth on this thread and explained to you the way things work.  No one is stopping you from going to the planes, pack yer ass up and go every dam day if you want.  No one cares how often you go or you don't go.  No one gives 2 shits that you was out of town on Indy day, or that you don't agree with the calendar.  If you decide to use the calendar, and don't agree with a rule, state that rule and offer an alternative. At that time it can be open for discussion.<br>
<br>
If you want to get 24 or 36 folks together and hit Hate every other night, by all means go ahead!  No ones is stopping you, or saying you can not do that.  But like I asked earlier...you can EXPECT to be treated a certain way by ruining other peoples game play.  Just as you can EXPECT to be treated differently by helping folks out along the way and enhancing/helping their game play.  Don't mean it's gonna happen...but you can EXPECT it.<br>

<br>
This is also a bannable offense, same as training.  You can live and let die.  But you can't kill.  However, it is quite legal to not aid.  No grouping, no teleports, no resses.  And, yup, it's a huge thing.  Ostracizing is cruel, it is harsh.  It is also pretty much the only social control we have in EQ, although a few rules exist now in regards to killstealing and scamming.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I see this thread as a step forward.  Jamany actually proposed another system.  A system that I personally feel entails a lot more of a headache than the current one.  But oh well, that's not my problem.<br>
<br>
No system is perfect.  But neither is having no system.<br>
<br>
If you want to be the proponent of the individual, the non-posting, Jamany... you can do that within the system.  As I said in my last post, if there is enough use of the independent days, their number can be expanded.  If there are more days, then you have more choice of when to go, more freedom to fit it into your schedule.<br>
<br>
Work within the system.  Work through the system.  Make the independent days work.  Improve the system to make still more people happy with it.  It'll take effort, it'll take work.  But it'll be a lot more productive than posting on the flame board.  Don't scream 'tear it down'... instead, work on building a nice little add on.<br>
<br>
Ask the admins for a new board section... independent day sign up.  Get admin priviliges for that section so that you can clean out old posts, etc.  You'll probably want a few boards, one to explain policies/tactics, one for hate sign up, one for fear sign up.  <br>
<br>
Take charge.  Make it work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujamany.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jamany</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/15/01 6:13:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: You guys are missing the point</span><hr size=1> Once again you fail to realize that I do not now nor will I EVER agree, use, or consider this calender valid.

You have no authority other than your very own power hungry, loot hungry, and pathetic attempts to make others follow you.  I am not one of those people.<br>
<br>
The idea I stated is the fourth one that I have proposed and each time I hear the same thing....too much work.....not enough time.....undoable..<br>
<br>
Please.  Obviously everything is doable if this calender started in the first place.  And as I am NOT the one telling people what they can and cannot do (even if you don't come out and say it), I have nothing at all to fear.  Threaten, harass, or whatever you chose to do.

For an adult and a parent you have to be the most juvenile person i have ever met. You are getting posts rebutting yours but politely and even got a compliment or 2...then you throw it all away with a flame and claims that contradict everything you said. <br>
<br>
Anyone who sits and trolls for their name to be thrown out, even in a passive sense so they can go on a vendetta is childish. Oh. and before you start going off about being a parent and age and resume's please dont start you dont want to try to compare. Go do your own thing then, but dont get too angry if your corpse is found on the ground by a mob that killed you and instead of being offered a res you hear laughter. Why? Its not due to the calender its due to your inability to enact within a social environment. You just had someone trying to provide you a little support and you throw a flame at them. Of all the arrogant, stupid, ignorant, pathetic (takes a deep breath) but no i shall not stoop to your level and insult personally. That is your forte'. Do as you wish J_____ny but be prepared for the consequences of your actions. Call it a threat if you wish, i prefer the word promise. AND ITS ALL WITHIN VERANTS GUILDELINES&gt;!!!! Do onto others as you would have them do onto you. Most people here are really nice people, but go ahead make enemies and see how much you actually will enjoy playing. PNP works both ways j___y. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujamany.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jamany</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/16/01 5:46:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A thought</span><hr size=1> The fu comments and the gtfo comments are as childish and low as you can go.

If you people would stop using me as a stab at each other than maybe i wouldn't get so angry.  <br>
<br>
As to res's.  I have enough high level cleric and paladin friends that I really do not require your assistance thank you very much.  Same with ports.  I find it amusing that you think without your help my character is doomed.  You are definitely on some power trip.<br>
<br>
I have not slammed anyone except the child swearing or attempting to swear at me.  As to nyca, yes i tried to make suggestions to get the calender to work with everyone.  But you obviously do not want to include everyone in your little circle.  So the calender does not exist for me.<br>
<br>
If you wish me to stop posting then once again I state for the record, &quot;quit adding my name to your posts&quot; and i will stop posting here.  <br>

Unless you accompanied BotS or CIW.  <br>
<br>
And since I'll believe BotS before I believe you, we all know there have been extensive changes in Fear.<br>
<br>
The only changes that I've seen you try to institute on the Calendar only meant more work for the Admins, and nothing on your part.  Suggesting more convoluted rules is not the answer.  And since you seem to see a problem with punishments for breaking any rules, instituting more just boggles my mind.<br>
<br>
I still have to ask.. what is your problem with becoming a Posting Entity, and having a day that YOU pick for YOU to go with all YOUR friends?  <br>
<br>
Please don't use the excuse that you don't want anyone telling you how to play the game, cause we all feel the same way.  I don't like the fact that YOU feel that YOU have the right to interfere with MY day in the Planes.<br>
<br>
OH.. and... YOU started this post.  YOU invited a Flame War.  Now YOU say YOU don't want us using YOUR name.  That's hypocritical, isn't it? <p>Nycah Aries'Syrensong<BR>

You seem to think I am the one on the high horse but all I am doing is explaining the RULES and the way I see things.<br>
<br>
You CANNOT claim a zone for yourself or group at ANY time.<br>
<br>
You CANNOT tell anyone the are not allowed to hunt there.<br>
<br>
These are from Verant plain and simple.  So maybe if you guys don't like the rules the way verant put them you should find another game that you can dominate.  Cause this isn't one of them.<br>

I will also use small words.<br>
<br>
NO ONE IS SAYING YOU CAN NOT GO TO THE PLANES.<br>
<br>
Do you understand so far? Good now part 2 of what has been said<br>
<br>
The calender is an agreement for others to respect your time there and not come up BY CHOICE.<br>
<br>
Still with me so far?K now the tough one.<br>
<br>
If you piss is in someones pool and do it on purpose,  be it right or wrong they will get mad? <br>
<br>
Final one, hang in there i know its tough.<br>
<br>
Do what you want. WE DONT CARE. But we will do what we want as well. ok? any confusion here?<br>
<br>
If you want to be part of this agreement then you meet the rules as well as we do. Otherwise,do as you wish, lie as many times as you want, hide behind verant and rules you really dont understand, make as many lame threats about banning people as you want,and also assume you are the only one who has spoken to a guide or gm about this. <br>
