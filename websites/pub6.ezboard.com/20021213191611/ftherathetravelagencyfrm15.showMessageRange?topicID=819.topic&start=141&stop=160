<br>
Whether Ken intended to rush CoN or not I wont say, although I will say I doubt it. Did he UNintentionally rush them?...seems pretty obvious that he did. When i have been in situations like this, I make sure to talk to any other force present...even go as far as to talk to any individuals present in most cases. <br>
<br>
As far as it being shitty to take him after it seems that CoN DID clear the majority of the gaurds...yeah, definately could have been handled better. <br>
<br>
Miscomunication...of course...it looks to me like raitlin was most assuradly NOT the only SoY in zone when Vindi WAS called, but regardless if you see 30+ people in the arena, at least ask them in tells (we all know how shitty ooc is for true communication) if theyre jsut farming...no need to even give them the idea to take Vindi. But just a camp check and a run in seems shady...someone suspected (at the very least) that CoN was going for Vindi or it would have been made public that SoY was moving in.  <p>Hutterr Verbruggen<br>

I just ask you, use some common sense, if i pull vindi now we will die hmm.. i talk to soy and pull vindi AFTER guards we win.. hmm.<br>

Did they feel rushed? Maybe, but we have no control over their feelings. Every guild is rushed on rotation... every guild races for race mobs.. it is part of the game. We felt rushed on statue, did we blame FK? No. Why should they be blaming us for this? Kenshiiro didn't pull vindi and FD by them and say take it or i take it. You guys had no reason what so ever to go and pull vindi + adds. once more, no puller in his right mind would do so, it is certain doom for a guild our size. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=granitfist>Granitfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 1:30:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=819.topic&index=144>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yamabushi</span><hr size=1> Ok few things I have gotten from this so far and a few things I would like to bring up.<br>
<br>
Raitlin did the initial check and was told, CoN was camping Vindi.  That has been proven.<br>
<br>
/who all Raitlin shows hes in SoY and in Kael<br>
<br>
Milabus and Lenerdar, please note that 12 seconds Later a /who was done listing who was in Kael.....<br>
<br>
So the only thing that CoN has &quot;proven&quot; with their logs is that Raitlin knew about CoN going after Vindi. Period.  Oh ya and that Kenshiiro is a prick for laughing at them.<br>
<br>
It was stated by CoN that they sent tells to SoY and it was settled that CoN was doing Vindi.  NO WHERE is there a log of that shown yet.  Ranquill states that NO communication was given between SoY and CoN.  But a log from CoN states other wise? HMMMMMM<br>
<br>
CoN apparently Tried to kill Vindi the first time and failed.....40 minutes later by Log.....SoY killed him.  Whats the problem here? You attempted a mob and failed, be gracious if someone else is waiting to kill him, let them.  <br>
<br>
When Kenshiiro first said they were pulling Vindi....wasn't it 40 minutes after your first attempt?  Where are the logs for the tells in between there where SoY stated they would stand down?  Ohh wait...thats right some of CoN say there was communication and some say that there wasn't.<br>
<br>
Basically this boils down to.....<br>
<br>
1)  Raitlin should be whipped and salted....yes I agree.<br>
2)  Kenshiiro is a big meanie ass for laughing at people...yes I agree<br>
3)  Seems that CoN is pissed off and the whole Rathe is pissed at SoY because they didnt wait for a mob more than once.<br>
<br>
Forming up that many people is a chore, granted CoN was there first and they had the right to attempt Vindi and they did.  But how many chances should a guild take when another guild is there waiting for them?<br>
<br>
CoN should be pissed at Raitlin for not passing up info, and maybe at Kenshiiro for insulting them a bit, but I think they should be really pissed that none of their raid leaders or officers are more aware of their surroundings.  I really find it hard to believe that for over an hour nobody there in CoN did a /who.........<br>
<br>
Kenshiiro did a camp check and was told by a CoN member they were doing left arena.  No one other than Raitlin was told differnt for a whole hour, now if you want to be pissed that SoY didnt give you chance and then chance again after you wiped out...why dont you just say...<br>
<br>
SoY sucks ass because WE WIPED our first shot at Vindi and they didnt give us another try at him.<br>

Regardless of whether SOY intentionally decided to ignore our claim, or whether their guild members don't even communicate with their officers, the point here, and it has been since post one for me, is that SOY had agreed to stand down after our wipeout and give us another go... then they changed their minds and pulled Vind.<br>

OMFG thank you. Someone willing to discuss the true matter at hand. Please can we discuss this point rather than the conjecture and bullshit we have been harping on for 8 pages?<br>
<br>
 You are absolutely correct. CoN is pissed off they didn't get a second chance after having made a crucial error on the first attempt. And they have every right to be. Rushing, tricking whatevering (hehe, new word) them into pulling early is just absolute bullshit. BUT, not allowing them to pull a second time after realizing the true nature of the situation? That was most definitely not the nicest thing to do. In fact, it was wrong. Look back at my posts. How many times have I tried to goad someone into this topic? (recall my &quot;fuck perhaps&quot; statement)This is the crux of the argument, the true issue.<br>
<br>
 And on this issue I say now that we were wrong for not backing WAY off and giving CoN another try. We had a lot of people there, it was getting late (East coasters here), regardless the reason, we should have backed away and left CoN to do there thing. For this, and only this, I apologize. <br>
<br>
Please note the &quot;I&quot; in that statement. This may not reflect the opinions of those directly involved in the decision to pull Vindi, but either way, it is my opinion.<br>
<br>

That is INCORRECT.  Kenshiiro was told via a tell that you were going to Buff up and try again.  We DID NOT AGREE to letting you try again.  Get it straight.  There is a difference.  He didn't say okay, he didn't say shit one way or another.<br>

Not bad at all. *applauds Brig on a job well done* Now give me some of that popcorn....<br>
<br>
<br>
Now on a more serious note. I won't be long. These are just my general feelings and opinions, mind you. I am not gonna make any assumptions about what was said between CoN and SoY that I didn't see myself in the ooc's.<br>
<br>
First off, I was at the raid. After killing the general in Kith, we  got the message to head to Kael for Vindi. Ok cool, would be my first time seeing Vindi. We get there and start preparing in WL. All good so far. We get to the right arena ramp and get the call that Vindi is gonna be soon. This whole time I was not aware of CoN's intent for Vindi, I knew they were there, just not for that reason. <br>
<br>
So Ken shouts that he is pulling Vindi soon. CoN objects. At that point, we were all confused about what was going on. Personally, I thought CoN was joking, which I got the feeling of from a few of the ooc comments.  So ok, we find out they meant business. Thats fine with me, so as far as I know, Ken backed down and was still trying to figure out what was going on. CoN pulled, they died.<br>
<br>
Now, as far as I saw in chats and all, I did not see anything that said CoN asked for another chance or anything like that. I thought they were gonna get rezzed and leave. So we pull Vindi and kill him.<br>
<br>
After that, CoN starts talking of us taking Vindi from them and shouting about rez lists, or something.  I am still confused about what was going on, outside of CoN wiping and than us pulling and killing Vindi. So I did not understand what was going on.<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I think it was just all miscommunication like others have said. CoN is a good guild. SoY is a good guild. Just our interaction with each other didn't go well. We are all nice enough players (I know most SoY members are kind, everyone has their bad apples, and the CoN members I have met are nice too).<br>
<br>
I don't live a very public life, like some posters here do (meant in a kind way) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . I don't have very many friends outside of SoY as most have left the game. I do hope that the few that know me, know me as a nice guy and a good chanter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . As far as I know, both CoN and SoY  are growing and trying to be the best they can be. We are not at all different, you know. Everyone is a human being.<br>

Where are the logs that we agreed to stand down?  Where are the logs?  There are no logs.  Know why?  We never agreed.  Thank you for BS'ing an attempt at a flame which turned sour. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->61st Beastlord<br>

<br>
 Concerning this &quot;incident&quot; with the Statue rotation...<br>
<br>
  Completely pulled out of context Nyca and you know it. Posts were deleted there and conversations went on in game concerning this matter. Fact of the matter is we succeeded on Statue with a &quot;soon to be member&quot; as tank. (please read prior post for details) So what? He is now in the guild. Oh, and yes, when we were told we could not do Statue again for many weeks even though we were NOT on the rotation...you are damn right we objected. Listen, we are either on the rotation or not. You can't tell us we are not on the rotation AND not allow us to attempt the mob so we may get ON the rotation. It just doesn't work that way, according to you. That is just greedy bullshit. So when we said ok, we will take Statue as often as is possible until you put us on the rotation you very quickly compromised and came up with a new scenario. In this new scenario we were provisionally on the rotation. This means we could not take Statue until it was our turn on the rotation but if we failed or had any invites we were immediately off the rotation. Wow, what bullshit. Fine, whatever, we did it. But the whole situation was petty and demeaning and absolutely unnecessary. My only hope is that we can try to see things more eye to eye in the future without having to be immediately condemned at the slightest appearance of inpropriety. Oh yeah, like that's gonna happen. A little benefit of the doubt? Not likely.<br>
