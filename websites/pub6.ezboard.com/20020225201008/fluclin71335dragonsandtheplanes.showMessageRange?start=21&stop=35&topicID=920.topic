<br>
and <br>
<br>
&quot;NO ONE can keep other guilds from killing Venril Sathir. But to kill him... you have to have quick feet.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Well this is what I was trying to get at with this post. <br>
<br>
I agree, no guild/player can stop you from killing anything. Everybody pays their 10 bux to play and has the right to kill whatever they want. <br>
<br>
What concerned me was the emergence of an alliance between the guilds on the rotation. <br>
<br>
An alliance whose sole purpose was to prevent guilds who may have stepped on the rotation guilds toes (whether this was accidental or intentional is irrelevant here) from ever killing VS again.<br>
<br>
This to me, seems like an unfair practice and would  probably violate the PnP policy.<br>
<br>
Friendly competition is fun. I for one like, the challenge in seeing who can mobilize their guild faster to accomplish a certain goal.<br>
<br>
I dont even mind multiple guilds teaming up to accomplish a goal either. <br>
<br>
It's when multiple guilds team up out of spite and possibly even hatred for another guild that bothers me.<br>
<br>
I know theres a lot of contention of mobs with the upper guilds. One of the goals that I know ever guild shares is to get their guild equipped with bigger, badder and better equipment. Everybody wants to move up and move on to bigger and harder challenges. Unfortunately loot only flows into the game so fast. No matter how fast they make it, its just never gonna be fast enuff. <br>
<br>
Here's where rotation lists come into play. They may not be the optimal solution, but as far as i can tell they work pretty damn good. <br>
<br>
I think a great example of this is the Ragefire rotation list. I have to say im pretty impressed with the communication that goes on in that thread. Everybody is always updating everybody else with what the latest haps are and whos doing what. Its what an old friend of mine would call good juju. <br>
<br>
I know recently we've had some issues pop up about KS'ing of spawns and and rotation violations and such. I'd like to say resolving these issues was handled in a great or even a decent manner, but I can't. In fact, Im pretty disappointed in how things were handled in the beginning. Stuff like the dragging people through the mud, flaming each other, calling each other ignorant, dumb, stupid, etc. Somthing I would expect from 5th graders. I think if everybody put all the issues out on the table and took the time to discuss them in a more (I really hate using this word) mature manner, I think we'd have resolved them alot faster. Anybody disagree?<br>
<br>
A few of you wonder why I dont post my character name on my posts. Well, this is probably one of the more prominent reasons I choose not to. You can drag me through the mud here all you want, but i dont want it to carry over into my characters world. The character I play in-game and the person I represent here are two different people. <br>
<br>
Re-reading over my post i think i touched base in quite a few areas, and alot of it just doesnt flow from point to point as smoothly as I had hoped and for that I apologize. I didnt intend on writing this much, but it looks like I did. Anyway, I'll just close with the following paragraph.<br>
<br>
All I'd like to see is just that everybody makes an effort to get along with each other and if an issue comes up, everybody works together in a civil manner to resolve the problem. The sooner we do, I think the better off we'll be as people, as guilds and as a server.<br>

<br>
So, speaking like a true newbie, I wanted to ask a few questions.  I ask this out of pure curiousity, but assume I'll get nicely flamed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
As I undertand it, the rotation currently involves a few guilds (what, 8?) taking turns on these mobs.  Would it be unreasonable for a few guilds that ordinarily couldn't kill VS alone, to band together, and request a spot on the rotation?  I'm not talking a permanant spot, but a single VS.  Or maybe you could leave 1 out of 10 VS's around, for the smaller guilds to take a shot at?  <br>
<br>
This would be a great way to clear up those &quot;monopoly&quot; misgivings that people have been expressing, as well as letting others enjoy a raid they normally couldn't go on.  <br>
<br>
Somewhere above it's said: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Is it fair to the smaller guilds? Well, yes and no. Do they have an equal shot at it. If they can mobilize faster than the rotation guild to take the spawn, then yes, they have an equal shot. If not, well then learn to mobilize faster so you can get there before the rotation guild.&quot; <br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I don't think this is a reasonable solution.  Lets assume for a minute that 3 or 4 smaller guilds did manage to &quot;KS VS&quot;.  First, the guild who's turn it was on the rotation would be dissapointed, and most likely upset.  Secondly, that's not at all good for a guilds reputation. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that the reasonable solution would be giving away a free vs every once in a while... <br>
<br>
What are the thoughts on this?  If it's been covered before a million times, I'm sorry. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Just wondering.<br>

<br>
The only problem I see is deciding who gets the opportunity to attempt VS.  Maybe at the end of the rotation we could leave a 24 hour &quot;window&quot; for any open raid that wants to attempt him.<br>
<br>
The other issue is how alliances will be addressed.  I know of at least one alliance that is most likely strong enough to do VS now, I'm sure there are others as well.  I suppose when leaders of any alliance wish to attemp VS they can bring the issue up with Valas and the guilds in the rotation.<br>
<br>
Both concepts add another level of complexity to the rotation and allow for abuse, but definitely have their merit.  <br>

20 ppl are suffisant for take him with no risk if well balanced with chanter and one good Warrior...<br>

I'm only surprise to see many story about that, its an easy mob, no ubber loot, just little better than POG legs and ridiculous if you see Keal legs...<br>

In fact its perhaps good to have a rotation on VS but many guild can slain him easly and when near 10 guilds can beat him... for Trak its more harder but with good resist gear ( 140 +  its VOX or Nagy raid..<br>

i have a feeling megahertz was talking about the little &quot;rotation guilds&quot; alliance you (not personally, not singling you out. just saying whoever it was) were forming to block AC (or Anyone besides the rotation guilds for that matter) from getting a shot at VS<br>
<br>
try re-reading what he says keeping the whole, &quot;we intend to keep AC from having another VS&quot; stuff that was being spouted earlier, in mind..<br>
<br>
<br>
just curious, and in the words of the wise owl. how many guilds does it take to kill a rotation<br>
<br>
sure, you guys were all content when there were only 2, 3, 4 guilds on the rotation that you had to contend with when those were your best drops you can get. but why not only allow a guild to be in the rotation for say, 3 weeks..<br>
only allowing 3 guilds on the rotation at any one time. with 1 &quot;open&quot; VS at the end of each rotation...<br>
and after a guild has had say, 3 weeks, they have to sit in a line to get back onto the rotation. meanwhile they can still take shots at the &quot;open&quot; VS if they feel it is worth their time<br>
and make the &quot;list&quot; like ragefire list..<br>
dunno if you want it to re-cycle or reset<br>
<br>
this is just something i came up with from the top of my head. but it seems much more fair to a newer guild. allowing them multiple shots at VS in a short period of time to maybe even essenitally be *done* with him?<br>
or at least give them multiple chances which you once had the fortune of having as well without having to wait a month between opportunities<br>
<br>
<br>
*shrug*<br>
i know no one will prolly even consider it and i'm just wasting time making myself look like a fool. but i just don't think it's fair to any of the newer/smaller people that have to put up with waiting 8x the length of time that the *founders* of the &quot;solution&quot; had to wait. who (arguably) may not care as much anymore.<br>
<br>
25 guilds going to have to wait out the rotation before you start this &quot;rotation guilds alliance&quot; to *block-out* another guild that decides to FFA? just hope all 24 support you, they won't mind waiting, just like you don't mind now (even if it is because you're busy getting better drops)<br>
<br>
<br>
again, these are not the thoughts or opinions of my guild. only ramblings (can't you tell) and ideas of myself. i'm a very passive person. i don't really care either way. just expressing thoughts/opinions/ideas/suggestions/etc.<br>

<br>
First off, it is my OPINION that there is nothing wrong with adding a alliance of guilds to the rotation.  I PERSONALLY would support it.  For instance, I know The Stryngs of Ayre, Veeshan's Talons and United Souls form an alliance.  I *personally* would have no problem adding an alliance of guilds to the rotation as if they were one guild (as long as they abide by the rules of the rotation and they guilds that participate remain constant).  Keep in mind the ALLIANCE of guilds would be entitled to ONE spot as if they were a single guild... not three.<br>
<br>
Obviously, this would be met my strong debate by the other alliance guilds.  This is only my view on it.  Should I ever be asked my opinion on whether an alliance of guilds could be added to the rotation... MY answer would be &quot;Yes of course; why couldn't they be added?&quot;<br>
<br>
/em puts flame retardant suit on<br>
<br>
Okay rotation guilds... have at me!  I know you'll disagree <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

maybe i didn't explain it correctly<br>
but after AC killed VS, triad/endo/ss/heroes/ib or whoever it was, i am not sure who all was being included, said they were going to assemble a force before every VS spawned to make sure AC never got to see VS again..<br>
supposedly<br>
and who knows if it really would have happened<br>
who knows how long it would have lasted<br>
who knows. the point is, that's what i think K9 was refering to. he can correct me if i'm wrong. it just seemed like that's what they were talking about when they were talking about an Alliance or whatever he refered to em as. just a force to prevent AC or .. in essence, all other players not currently in the rotation<br>
<br>
and supposing a guild purposely was intending on FFA'ing VS every time he spawned, would the *rotation guild alliance* or whatever, actually assemble that force? would every member of all these guilds support the PURPOSE of this alliance, as to keep other players from a spawn? and i think he questioned that as being against the EULA or PNP, and a valid reason for an alliance and what this meant about these guilds and their &quot;play nice&quot; and &quot;fairness&quot; policies, etc.<br>
not sure, go read the post<br>
<br>
<br>
changing onto your topic now,<br>
i, personally, would definately support multi-guild groups and non-guilded players, etc. to have a shot at doing VS and trak. nearly every exp-group formed is a non/multi-guild group until you hit the mid/late 50s. why should *THESE TWO SPAWNS* be artificially entitled to these 6, 8, 10, etc guilds that *decided* ah, yah, let's make a rotation so we don't fight..<br>
well the reason there was fighting is because it was highly contested, and a select number of very competative guilds were competing. of course there's going to be some conflict, etc. there will always be, especially with 1500 people co-existing at one time.<br>
i think the server has moved a ways from hostile competition (until there was talk of a rotation guild alliance to forcefully compete for a spawn without even trying to reason with, or talk to the leaders involved).. but those are the same ones that Had to create a rotation because they couldn't get along while barking at everyone else about fairness and helping eachother....<br>

that EULA thing was k9's<br>
<br>
i was more curious about all your guilds agreeing with the fact that brute force is acceptable, but only when our rotation is threatened.<br>
not really curious. pretty sure i know the answer. just fun to waste time thinking about. for me at least. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unyatesevos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NyateseVoS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Pawn</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/01 12:17:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venril Sathir rotation with regards to AC</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Would it be unreasonable for a few guilds that ordinarily couldn't kill VS alone, to band together, and request a spot on the rotation?

<br>
Nope, pretty sure Azariah and I are on the same page Yaen.<br>
<br>
It is in no way against the EULA or PnP for the rotation guilds to ally themselves and take every VS as it spawns... just as Valas stated.  No where does the PnP state anything about a guild monopolizing spawns.  To FORCE a guild away from a spawn so another guild has a chance at it... that IS against the PnP though.<br>
<br>
It's all somantics anyhow.  Point is you really have a few options:<br>
<br>
1. Play by the rules of the rotation, and ask to get into the rotation.<br>
2. Don't play by the rules of the rotation.  Mobilize faster and take the spawn.  Endure the flames.<br>
3. Plead to the rotation guilds to change policy<br>
4. Join a guild already on the rotation<br>
5. Forget about Venril Sathir, and have fun with other mobs<br>
<br>
That is just 5 of the things you could do.  Obviously there are more.<br>
<br>
VI does not involve themselves with server politics.  This is just an example of politics.  As far as VI is concerned... LoS (or any other guild for that matter) could take every VS spawn right as it spawned... if they aggro it first there is nothing in the EULA or PnP to prevent it.<br>

I wouldn't classify forming an alliance to kill VS as he spawns as &quot;brute force&quot;.  The rotation guilds are simply trying to protect the rotation which they have worked hard at.  Is it unfair?  Define unfair for me.  Does it allow people a chance at VS... sure, if they get there sooner (which has already happened by the way - Asura).<br>
<br>
In my opinion Yaen... you are trying to fuel a fire that doesn't exist.  You seem to harbor some resentment of the rotation guilds, probably because of the &quot;misunderstanding&quot; between AC and the aforementioned guilds (since that is what AC seems to want to call it). <p>Nyatese Nivaro<BR>

actually no. i'm not trying to fuel anything<br>
i dragged myself unintentionally back into it trying to explain what i thought k9 was saying about the rotation guilds banding together<br>
<br>
while i think k9 was questioning whether it was against pnp, i knew it wasn't. but the next person that responded seemed to think they were talking about multi-guild alliances joining in on the rotation..<br>
<br>
i was questioning more the ethics behind the mindset of might makes right . when it puts the rotation into check<br>
who even says rotation works best? those guilds in the rotation. we haven't even considered changing/revising things after this rotation has been the same for how many months now<br>
anyways. just the ethics behind any random guild disagreeing/going after a spawn fairly and getting sh~t on for it. and then in turn, those guilds who shouted out at someone wanting FFA, turn around and FFA it as long as it could be kept between themselves..<br>
i just don't see how you can be pissed at someone for wanting FFA when your solution to it is FFA back<br>
it's just like everyone saying. <br>
&quot;god why does everyone call eachother names all it does is make yourself look like an idiot. god damn all you morons that cuss and make fun of eachother are idiots i can't believe you degrading other people what are you thinking, morons..&quot;<br>
<br>
why not at least attempt to establish some sort of peacefull resolution instead of immediately organize a posse to go kill the outlaw. especially when you try to speak of fairness and cooperation while you're doing it.<br>
<br>
anyways, no, it's over. i really don't care. like i said. i'm a complete pacifist. i'm all talk. i don't think you'll ever see me do anything malicious or spitefull. i have no hate for anyone, not even people that claim to hate me. i don't care what you guys do with the spawn. i have 0 drops that i could ever want from him anyways. if you want to exclude me from your fun or whatever, so be it. i think that about wraps it up<br>
sorry if i offend anyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=920.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=920.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=920.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=35><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/es/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=920.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.threadControl?topicID=920.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/es/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=920.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=920.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes>Dragons and the Planes</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
