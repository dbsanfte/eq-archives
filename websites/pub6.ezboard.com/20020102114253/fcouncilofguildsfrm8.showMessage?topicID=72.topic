<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   To KCoG representatives - copy a link of this page to your guild forums to notify your raiders of this information.<br>
Nagafen Raiders - Print out a copy of this page.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Dragon Raiders - hope you're all dutifully acquiring your resist gear in advance of the Vox Raid scheduled for tonight.  I've taken some time to put together this post for organization so the raid body can move as expediently as possible.  Taking notes from the last Vox raid on what worked and what didn't work so that the Organizational concerns will be addressed for this raid.<br>
<br>
First off.<br>
<br>
We need are a few volunteers to assist with the Organizational aspects of the raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   ATTENDANCE TAKER:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You must arrive 30-45 minutes prior to the raid and begin taking taking attendance immediately.  Shout to the zone to have raiders send you a direct /tell with their Name, Level, and Class.  You must respond to each of these individuals with a simple '/r ok got you down' (would help if you set up a hotkey for it).  Leave me your e-mail and I'll send you a copy of th class attendance spreadsheet which you will need for this part.  Just add players to each class column as they arrive.<br>
<br>
When Haemish arrives - contact him and when he's ready, report the attendance to Haemish class by class like this '/tell Haemish Monks player 1, player 2, player 3, etc...'  Haemish has the attendance list and will check off people as you send them a tell and will begin forming groups as soon as all of the raiders have arrived.<br>
<br>
Do constant shouts of &quot;/shout Send me a tell so I can take you down for attendance, if you're not sure if I got your name just send me a tell anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   BUFF LINE ORGANIZER:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Leave me your e-mail and I'll send you the list of who does what buffs and what buffs must be cast and in what order.  The Buff groups must consist of Enchanters, Ranger, Shaman, Clerics, and or Druids plus a support team consisting of  a bard/necro to feed mana, mages to supply mod rods, and druids to heal the folks that consume mod rods.   Space out the buff team and call the classes, class by class to recieve their buffs and then camp out.  Send a shout stating the order of the buffers, and what buffs each player should expect in the order they need to be recieved.  Each player must emote each buffer to let them know they're ready for a buff and the buffer must indicate that when they are done buffing the player so the player knows to move to the next buffer.  Last time, the buffers were so close together that it was tricky to know if you got what you needed. I recall specifically that some players either did not receive DMF or clicked it off - and some of these folks were the same ones that got feared into the pits, something that wouldn't have happened if DMF was still active.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   GROUP LEADERS:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You will be chosen by Haemish and you need to do alot to keep him informed.  Always respond to calls of readiness and do your best to keep your group informed and disciplined.  Move to a staging area when the calls are given then have your group sit and wait until everyone has arrived, then call out constantly to let Haemish know where you are and whether or not you're ready.  Always repeat orders given regardless of whether they're shouted.  <br>
<br>
Also when your group is formed - manually inspect each of your members to confirm whether or not they have the necessary equipment to fulfill the minimum 70 FR/CR resist levels.  Whether or not they will be included on the raid will be determined at that time.  Also, as soon as your group is formed - collect 50pp from each player that will be divided up later and paid to the enchanters and clerics that purchased reagents for the raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   ORGANIZATION and other POINTS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   PRE-RAID CHECKLIST</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Turn down your clipping plane<br>
Turn off the Sky<br>
Turn off Particle effects<br>
Turn off Player Names<br>
Filter out the &quot;Other's Hits&quot; in your chat filter<br>
The only filter that should be Off is the one with your hits<br>
Set up 2 /assist keys for the Primary assist and the Secondary /assist - If you're not sure how to do that - ask someone in advance of the raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   GROUP SELECTION</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I think but I'm not sure that we let everyone that showed up to the Vox raid join - that's why we had 9 teams (and 8 at the end).  Preference will be given to Clerics and Enchanters, then whoever signed up on the KCoG board when the sign up was listed.  Groups will be selected based whether or not you signed up in advance and then by class and level.  <br>
<br>
There are 42 spots open and about a dozen reserved for management.  However - the last Vox raid took on a lot of walk ons and everyone got to participate in the raid, so even if you didn't sign up - show up and if there's room, Haemish will add you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   RESISTS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Folks - there were a number of players on the Vox raid that did NOT have the requisite resists to survive an encounter with Vox - and guess what, each one of them to a person was dead at the end of the battle.  Please understand, if you participate on a Dragon Raid and do not have the minimum resists - you become a liability to the raiding party and will contribute nothing significant to the final battle.  We need you folks alive and keeping Vox off the casters who do all the real damage anyway.  You can't do that if you're dead or feared and resists are the key to overcoming that.  Atton put together a great list of Resist equipment on another thread and you'd do well to read it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   REAGENTS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Clerics and Enchanters - you are responsible for purchasing your own Reagents.  Outlay the cash - and you will be reimbursed 100% for your expenditure. Group Leaders will be responsible for collecting 50pp reagent fee from each of their members and then reimbursing the enchanters and Clerics.  I think Verius spent close to 600-700 pp for peridots, as well Cassia and Fazlazen.  That was enough for about 60-80 peridots apiece for the purpose of the raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   TANKS:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Program 2 hotkeys <br>
#1) /shout &quot;[PlayerName] Coming in for  a Heal&quot;<br>
#2) /shout &quot;Target [PlayerName] for a Heal&quot;<br>
<br>
On the Vox raid - Tanks were out of range of the healers and shouting for heals.  The Healers were dutifully targeting their tanks, casting heal, and then burning it because the Tanks were out of healing range.  So to address this,  when you hit 50%, Shout that you're coming in for a heal, run back for a heal, and then, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   WHEN YOU ARE IN RANGE OF THE HEALERS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> hit your /say &quot;Target [PlayerName] for a Heal&quot;.  Just remember - Taunt until Vox hits you then stop taunting.  Take as many hits as you can and then run back for a heal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   HEALERS:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Get used to using /target [PlayerName] if you're healing someone outside of your group.  Target everyone who comes through the door and heal them regardless of whether or not they shouted,  There are usually enough druids to accomplish this so that 3 simultaneous casts of GHeal will completely heal a tank.  Just heal everyone that comes through the door.  The addition of this, plus the tanks shouting should keep everyone fully healed.  It sounds a bit redundant, but it's definately better to get overhealed then underhealed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   NUKERS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Just remember you have to stand within melee range of Nagafen to get a spell to stick.  Debuffers Shout out when you get Malosi, or Tashani to stick.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   THE BUFF LINE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

15        Lev/DMF                        Druid, Necro, Ranger, Enchanter, Wiz, Mage<br>
<br>
The following classes will be buffed in this order<br>
Warrior<br>
Paladin<br>
Shadowknight<br>
Rogue<br>
Monk<br>
Ranger<br>
Bard<br>
Shaman<br>
Wizard<br>
Enchanter<br>
Magician<br>
Cleric<br>
Necro<br>
Druid<br>
<br>
The buff organizer will shout to the zone who is buffing and what buff that player will cast.  You need to write down that information in the exact order it is shouted so you know who to expect buffs from and what buffs you need to expect.  When you're ready, get into a line as per the Buff Organizer's instructions, then walk up to the first buffer, target them then /bow, /burp, /dance, /taunt whatever - just emote them to indicate that you are ready.  When the buffer is done casting on you - they need to /say or /emote you that they are done buffing you.  A simple &quot;/say I am done buffing you %T&quot; hotkey is sufficient.  Then move to the next buffer to receive your next set of buffs.  If the person in front of you isn't done yet - then wait until they are and THEN emote the buffer.  In other words, don't emote the buffer until you're standing directly in front of them.<br>
<br>
Bards must sing mana song for the buff group, Buffers must space themselves an appropriate distance so bunching up doesn't happen, Necros must feed mana to the buffers, Mages must continually summon mod rods, Druids must heal the buffers that consume mod rods.<br>
<br>
Our original buff crew consisted of:<br>
Ranger Casting Agi and Strength<br>
Enchanter casting Rune<br>
Shaman casting Dexterity, Stamina and Talisman<br>
Enchanter casting Augment or Clarity/Rune/Resist Magic<br>
Cleric Casting Symbol, Heroism, and Shield of Words<br>
Druid Casting Cold/Fire Resist<br>
Then a Necro for DMF<br>
<br>
the first 8 buffs are either trash or expendable buffs - because 30 seconds into the fight, they'll be dispelled.  They're cast in this order so that the important buffs remain intact and will no doubt allow you to live long enough to see the great dragon fall.<br>
<br>
oh and another note - (chuckle) don't emote the bard - you'll most likely draw nothing but a snide remark.<br>
<br>
When you're done buffing - camp out and go to the chat room which will most likely be 'Nagafen Karana' or something to that effect.  Haemish will most likely go last and then do a quick briefing of the strategy and then give you guys the log in command. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   ATTITUDE, PERSPECTIVE AND PATIENCE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Guys, let's be honest here.  This is a great thing the KCoG is doing and the last thing the raid organizers need is to have to deal with people who are impatient or have generally bad attitudes.  If you go - expect to be there for 4-6 hours (longer if things go bad).<br>
<br>
Don't ask When are moving? ...You'll move when your group leader tells you to move<br>
Don't ask Will we be getting any experience? ...No you'll probably walk out with less experience then when you started<br>
Don't ask Why is this taking so long? ...It'll take as long as it takes to safely attack the Dragon<br>
Don't ask Will I be able to roll on so and so? ...It's been posted<br>
Don't say &quot;This sucks, so and so uber guild can do this in 60 minutes&quot;  Cry me a river - if you don't like the way it's done, join an uber guild.  <br>
<br>
in other words ... SAY SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE OR DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.  or as Lagdalen puts it so eloquently - Diffuse don't provoke.<br>
<br>
The folks that organize and run these raids are doing it for YOUR benefit not theirs.  It's because of THEIR EFFORTS that you're even able to go on these raid so cut them some slack.  I warned a lot of players last time that this kind of attitude is 100% UNACCEPTABLE and we will have no compunction about disinviting you from your group and sending you on your way on future raids.<br>
<br>
We've accomplished something here that doesn't exist on any other server in this form.  I've recieved a ton of e-mails asking how we set this up and how we got the KCoG to work - so let's not do anything to ruin the fun of others with bad attitudes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyhoo - that does it for me - good luck on your raid this weekend - take that badboy down and /shout the name of the KCoG everywhere you go.<br>
<br>
<br>
Safe journies friends.<br>

People who cannot cast some form of Shielding on themselves need Talisman.  However, it's very important that casters who can cast Shielding cast their own Shielding buff when they reach the Shaman.  The Shaman and the caster must both be aware of this, and alert for it.  Talisman is great for melees, but does not have magic resistance, which Shielding does.  Talisman overwrites Shielding, but I've always felt, and particularly on a dragon raid, that the MR from Shielding is far better than the extra HP's from Talisman. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uplangstrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>P Langstrump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/8/01 4:02:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.interlog.com/~wings/jane/a_lindgren/lindgren_pics/pippi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Organizing for the Nagafen Raid - *** PLEASE READ </span><hr size=1> wow, shoji, very nice - thanks!<br>
