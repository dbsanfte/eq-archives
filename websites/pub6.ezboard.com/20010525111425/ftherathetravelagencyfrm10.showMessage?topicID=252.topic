<br>
The majority of the next few hours was spent doing CR after needless CR.  The entire experience left a bitter taste in many of our mouths, but we sucked it up and played by the rules.<br>
<br>
As the 2am PST deadline approached, Dracoliche finally went down (Monsoon to Fiall, wtg), but Cazic was probably another hour or two away.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, for whatever that's worth, FR had more than a fair chance at sealing the deal (3+ hours), and should probably go to the end of the BB line.<br>

FoR was called in to help BB fear with under 3 hours to clear over 50% of the plane, including Draco, all three golems and CT.  I'm sorry, but even if ALL of FoR's standard planes people showed up, was fully buffed and ready to go, it would be virtually impossible to do all of the above in 3 hours.  <br>
<br>
There is no set rule as for &quot;when&quot; a BB should be called in to assist.  However, it's my peronsal opinion that calling a BB guild to assist with draco, CT, 3 golems and 50% of the plane requires a &quot;reasonable&quot; period of time.  The time frame in which we had to operate last night was not even close to &quot;reasonable&quot;.  <br>
<br>
In my personal opinion you guild's call for assistance was too late and I highly doubt that ANY guild called on 3 hours notice could organize sufficient people, insert and complete the plane.  <br>
<br>
----- Personal Rant -----<br>
<br>
In all liklihood people are soon to be bitching that &quot;2&quot; CT's were not killed on their respective dates.  While true, one must question where to place the blame.  Was it the BB's fault?  My personal opinion is not a friggen chance.  BB's are there to assist, not to do the impossible.  So far, the last two BB calls were BOTH made with under 3 hours to clear most if not more then 50% of the plane, Draco, 3 golems and CT.  On a realistic timeframe, in order to clear the above you need more then 3 hours. <br>
<br>
Yes, most of the &quot;bigger&quot; and &quot;more experienced&quot; guilds (not even gonna bother to try to name who they are), can do the planes in 3-5 hours depending on whether the respective gods are up.  However, please take into consideration these guilds have been doing this for quite some time and have a system and organization in place to make it go like clockwork.  Calling a BB must take into consideration that many people may or may not be on given the time in which the call is made.  On top of that fact, a BB guild is there to assist, not run the plane's raid.  Consequently, you cannot reasonably expect the BB to be able to do the entire plane in the same manner it would if it was operating alone.  This obviously will lead to more delays.<br>
<br>
Personally, on a best-case scenario, Fear+CT+Draco can be done in 5 1/2 - 6 hours, maybe less under optimal operating conditions.  All I ask is that any guild in the plane with the gods up please look at their situation realistically and make a decision which allows the system to work.  If you have failed to kill Draco by 9-10pm PST, you aren't going to be able to clear the plane.  <br>

The posistion we now face is that of was this enough time for the majority of the BB guilds to execute this plan and kill Cazic on time.  <br>
<br>
I have no doubt that your guild is skilled, however in fairness to the intent of the rules i must ask the question, if BoTS, CIW, DBN, MFH, or KEG were called in on either of these cases, would the gods of died?  This is something which is going to take alot of discussion to answer in all fairness to all involved parties.  <br>
<br>
A good place to start is to list the times where the bb guild was first contacted of their need to be in the planes, and when they actually got into the planes.  <br>
<br>
I should also point out that it was common knowledge that the god would be up this evening, it should of been known that there was a halfway decent chance of being called apon, if what i have read elsewhere is in fact accurate, and first contact was made at 10 pm pmt, and FR did not enter the planes in force till 11 pm est, that something was incorrect on that account.  If i knew a god was up and a newer guild *in comparison to some of the older guilds, no disrespect intended* i would believe that a strong argument can be made that an hour to amass a force under these circumstances is too long.  <br>
<br>
However, never doing it myself i can not know for certain, that is why i ask for more input before anyone makes any decision.  Thank you.</font><P><font color = green size = 4> Manas Pineblade, Stalker reborn<br>

Since we are new to the rules. By being new, I mean SON is new to the planes as a posting guild. And we are still learning the rules that are set up.<br>
<br>
On 2/1, SON had Fear and we had been clearing the plane, from 7pm est to about 9:30 pm est, when the server dropped out. We came back with the knowledge that we were gonna have a repop in the zone and we had to start all over. By 1:30am est we had gotten to Dracolich and was preparing for him when Draco himself hit camp and CT started DTing the crowd. I made the call at that time to call in FOR myself. I am the person in SON whose burden that falls on. Now when I made the call to get them in they had to get forces from all over, and I do mean all over, I did a who all on FOR and they were everywhere. In 30 minutes they had folks in zone and helped with Dracolich. They whole time we knew the clock was ticking. We did everything in the book to clear the plane and clear CT. <br>
<br>
My question is and it must be asked, no one expected the server to shut down, so with the stuff happening like it did and with SON themselves making the call to try with it being so late, Did we do wrong? I know FOR came in and did everything under the sun to get to Cazic. WE went into overtime, and I mean we had pulls coming all over. CT was hitting us every 10 minutes with DTs, no let up on any of us. And we tried. Why should anyone be punsihed for something that noone expected? Noone expected the server to go down? Then most folks have to work day shifts, so there was a big problem with numbers, we were doing everything possible in a bad spot. Why jump down FOR's throat when they did what they were suppose to? We as SON failed I quess in not making the call sooner. FOR did not do anything wrong and came and did as they should. If blame should be put on anyone, it shall lie on my shoulders for leading my guild onward when the server came up. Understand now, that we started back at 10pm est with a full pop. And being new as a guild we made the call to try and in 3 hrs we had 3/5's of the zone cleared. When FOR was called they had to help with mass cr's. Which put us at 2:30am est starting the raid back up. In 2 and a half to 3 hrs we did Dracolich, the 3 golems and all the stuff except for CT. And we were at CT with 2 to 4 mobs left when the sever shut down again. <br>
<br>
Maybe I should have made the call sooner, maybe I should have not tried to do the raid once the sever crashed and should have made the call when it came back up. I don't know and I didn't think that we should have called someone in so soon. This must be looked into as to the time anyone should be required to call in the BB. I just don't know but I do know FOR did what they were suppose to. <br>

Oh please....El'lar is HIGHLY overrating their skills and abilities if this is where you ended up at 2a EST.... <br>
<br>
Didnt your raid begin at 8p EST? 6 hrs to make it less than halfway thru the zone? You only had 3 more hours to finish but yet you still claim you could have? Please be rational... if it takes 6 hrs to go less than halfway then it will most likely take significantly MORE than 3hrs to finish the other half. At what point were you going to admit El'lar couldnt do it in the timelimit? 4a EST? 5a EST?  BB guilds are *required* to follow the very same timelimits as all other guilds... staying to finish the job was NOT an option given the time contraints we had.<br>
<br>
<br>
--------RANT MODE ON---------------<br>
<br>
BB guilds are there to ASSIST the other guild... NOT to &quot;DO&quot; the Plane for them. This does require the OTHER guild to put forth SOME effort and NOT sitting up on the hill and in the back of the camp bitching and moaning while the BB Guild does the vast majority of the work. In some fights last night I could count on one hand how many El'lar folks were actually engaging the mobs... if you were THAT pissed off about calling us we would have been far better off with you vacating the Plane than to depend on YOUR people to actually do their jobs. The day BB Guilds are expected to come in and &quot;do&quot; the Planes for another guild is the day when the loot that drops is OURS.... BB Guilds are not the Charity Line... we FULLY expect the other guild to put forth EFFORT in an attempt to clear the Plane... for this we get NOTHING except any Epic items that will most likely not even drop. BB Guilds are there to ASSIST... NOT to kill all the mobs and hand over the PH4T L3WTS while the other guild sits idly by doing nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
*NOTE:  This RANT does not apply to SoN who by all accounts put forth a valiant effort Thursday night*<br>
<br>
<br>
---------- RANT MODE OFF-------------<br>
<br>
<br>
The Calendar Admins DO need to take a serious look at this issue.... BB guilds being called in far too late to have any hope of finishing *is* a problem and so far FoR has taken the brunt of this. Perhaps setting some type of &quot;benchmark&quot; mob like Draco would be appropriate.... Draco should be killed by *X-time* and if it isnt the BB Guild on call MUST be called in. The other option is to remove the time constraints on the BB Guilds and allow them to stay past the 2a PST limit thereby giving them sufficient time to assure the God dies. As the rules are right now we are leaving when/if a BB Guild is called in to some guilds who do not fully understand the forces and time it takes to clear Planes and kill Gods and then expect a BB Guild to make miracles happen.<br>

My question is, FoR knows they can't accomplish the task in three hours. Would it be possible to call in the next BB guild and then perhaps have a roll for what drops? It has been said that under no circumstances should a god be left up, so what do you do when a BB guild knows they can't do it?<br>
<br>
I realize that this is a problem that would effect the BB rotation but, I would say that FoR would lose its place in the rotation and the next BB guild would not be rotated since they were called unexpectdly. Just a thought.</font><P><html>

In regards to your snarky little comment, we have cleared Fear in just over 3 hours. But that of course is with our regular plane people and of course no god being up. I'm sure you've been to fear when Cazic is up. When he DT's, the campouts really take away alot of time and momentum. Other things to complicate matters, BB's are called in when the other guild is usually in trouble. We don't just walk in and start killing...we gotta CR the people of the other guild/alliance and get them set up first. Like my fellow mates have stated, we don't go in and take over the show.<br>
<br>
I realize it's up to the leaders of the guilds and the admins here, but I don't think it's up to the people in the cheap seats. What were you doing last night at 4-5am Xedd? I'm sure it wasn't CR.<br>

I zoned into Fear last night to help El'lar Dobluth because I had personal friends there having problems...like Bago, Syrinx, Sikanak, Fiall...<br>
<br>
I ended up taking several DTs, having a nekkid corpse rot due to mobs camping the body and losing that exp, and of course not needing nor wanting any loot from that entire zone.  Only there to lend a hand to personal friends.<br>
<br>
In return for our efforts, Konofo acts like a lil snitch ass bitch on this board.  Kono, go fuck yerself.  You are the ones who called for help because you were too incompetent, and you called way too late.  Half the zone still up, including golems, Draco, CT.  Did you kill anything?  By the way, I noticed that when Draco was pulled...yer guild had about 8 people in the zone.  The rest ran home like cry babies.<br>

I suppose my expectations were unrealistic.  I was under the impression that a BB guild would have sealed the deal.<br>
<br>
I agree that you should not have to adhere to the same 2am PST deadline.<br>
<br>
I also agree that we spent too much time being stubborn and upset.  However, the raid was pretty much taken over by FR, and we had no control over anything.  We didn't have a guild rep in all groups to monitor loot, we didn't have any communication, and we generally didn't have time to loot our corpses before pulls were coming in. :P<br>
<br>
Finally, I agree do need to come up with a more solid guideline on when to call in BB guilds, and what is to be expected of them.<br>

<br>
On thursday eve FoR claimed they had under 3 hours to clear.<br>
<br>
Ever night a god is up I keep in touch with the guild there to find out how things are going. I remember SPECIFICALLY FoR being in the plane of fear on thursday (I who all them and saw the there about 12 of them) at 1:15 am thats 3hours and 45 min not under 3. I am not saying this is or is not enough time, just that they are understateing the time they were there.<br>
<br>
As far as Friday night goes I was a tad busy in PoG and I couldnt get any one on /who all for ED (probably because I was spelling it wrong) so I cannot verify fridays length of time.<br>
 <br>
But I am completely sure FoR was in the plane of fear thursday well over 3 hours.</font><P>Vincecross Dhark'baen

<br>
Your veiled accusations about having monitors for loot is disturbing Konofo as I can vouch for the fact that nothing was picked up.  If you had bothered to inspect most of us,  you would have seen that we are in no need of Blighted, Umbral, and the other drops off those mobs.  Instead you commenced to bitch and moan.  You know what that bitching and moaning got you?  It got you killed.<br>
<br>
Anyome that was up there and tries to dump this mess onto us should be well aware of the fact that their leadership is the one that let them down.   SoN had a great night during utter server chaos,  you all on the other hand just had chaos.  You got have an answer for that?<br>

The problem is pride.. If you are GM of a guild i guess its a negative admission to have to ask for help.. After all these are your peeps and you have bled with them and died with them and are very very close.. So you have the faith that things will work out and that your guild can do it.. <br>
I just think that we need to inform guilds that have the Gods up, that if 11PM EST rolls around and you are not getting around to the point where you can kill Draco.. it might be a good idea to call. Mainly to help your guild get the planes armor and god loot you need so that on your next trip you will have that little edge.<br>

This whole Epic thing has been in the hands of the Epic guild/alliances...not the Calendar Admins.  It has NEVER been clearly defined to us exactly how it was supposed to be run.  We were never told HOW to set up the rotation...never got ANY input from the Epics even tho attempts were made to get their thoughts.  If we had our druthers, there wouldn't be Epics.  It's a major headache from our point of view, but something that was agreed upon.<br>
<br>
The Calendar Admins are here to monitor things ONLY.  We also try to ensure compliancy with the rules that the community has set up.  And on occasion, we have to met out reprecussions of folks breaking the rules.<br>
<br>
This is something that the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Epics</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have to work out themselves.  We cannot.  We have not been given the authority to make rules.  We are merely here to see that the rules are followed to the best of our ability.  The only thing that we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> can</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do is make suggestions, to attempt to diffuse an explosive situation.<br>
<br>
What I would suggest is a meeting amongst the epics to attempt to come up with something, and bring that before the community for their input as well.</font><P><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Edwina Nytengayle<br> </strong></font></center>

The fact is our bigest problem Friday night was lag.  We must have lost 2 hours because of it - there was a point when we only had 18 of the 42 people on the raid online.  All the other folks were ld (and The Rathe was listed as &quot;DOWN&quot; on the server select screen).  When we finally did realize that this lag had ruined our chances to clear the zone in time we called in FR.  Maybe it was too late.  Anyway, to be honest we were not happy about having to call in FR, but we understood that it was the right decision.  We honestly beleive that the server caused the problem.<br>
<br>
Now onto the more important issue - the non communication between the guilds when FR did enter the zone.  We had no idea what to expect.  It was our impression that when a BB guild comes to help they take over leadership of the raid.  They name a puller, they reform grps if need be, they name an assist, and they give direction to the guild that is there.  Most of this was not done.  There was very little to no communication as to what was going on - I blame both guilds for this.  <br>
<br>
Jorren asks: <br>
<br>
&quot;Why did you guys pull Draco 5 minutes after we arrived? Along with what seemed a handfull of mobs? No one was ready for that pull, not even your guild. That is what caused one of those long corpse recoveries, not our presence.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hehe, I was going to ask the same exact question to FR.  He was pulled on the very first pull after FR entered zone and it was not someone from our guild that pulled him.  Needless to say, he wiped out everyone and a long and painful CR had to be done.  I think that pull is where most of the anomosity came from as many from our guild were extremely angry that he was pulled with no warning.  At that point all we could think was &quot;we just called in a BB guild and they just killed the entire party, WTF is that.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think it is absolutely necessary to determine exact rules about what is supposed to happen when a BB guild comes to help.  Who designates the puller?  Who makes up groups?  Who communicates with the guild that is there so we are prepared for pulls?  As soon as FR entered the zone there was absolutely no organization or communication between the guilds, in my opinion that is what caused the fiasco.  Nothing else.<br>
<br>
I want to thank FR for coming in with the best intentions of helping us clear the plane.  I also want to apologize for any inappropriate comments that might have been made by any member of ED during the raid.  It all came from pure frustration - a crappy server ruined any chances at a succesful raid and then politics ruined our fun.<br>

Saturday: FR called into BB and fail to kill CT again.<br>
Sunday: FR has Fear and can now kill CT at their leisure and loot not only the epic pieces but also CT's normal loot drops. <br>
<br>
The new calendar was put in place to do away with the constant scamming that was going on. Either FR is just working a new scam or they are simply unable to fullfill their BB duties and need to be removed from the BB list. And for those BB guilds complaining that they dont have enough time to clear the zone before the 2am deadline, any BB guild should be able to completely clear Fear in under 4 hours with CT/Draco up.
