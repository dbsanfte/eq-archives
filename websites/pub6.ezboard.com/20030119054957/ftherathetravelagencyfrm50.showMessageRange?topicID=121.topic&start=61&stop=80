<br>
You want Named Drakes FFA?  Fine.  I'll be there with 20-30 NB EVERY patch.  We NEED Named drake to finsh quests, not Doze.  You think you can beat NB, TL and BotS to Named?  We all need them to complete our quests.  Every patch we will be there, killing all the armor giving mobs, because yea I have some twinks that could use armor.  BotS will be 3 screens away camping 2 other Named, and Tindi will be in another spot camping those named.  Every 7 days, every patch.  This is what will happen if Named Drake go FFA.  You think you'll get alot of armor farming in while we're there?<br>
<br>
Or... Doze and Named are treated as one rotation like they are now.  The guild thats up for Doze comes in once a week, for 2-3 hours and then is gone, and you can farm armor all the rest of the time.<br>
<br>
You think we wouldn't love for named drake to be FFA?  We complete 1 Doze quest every 1-2 months now.  If named drakes were FFA we would be there everytime they spawned, making sure we were there before you to kill them.  We could probably complete 3-4 quests in the first month alone.<br>
<br>
But thats not what rotations are about.  Rotations are here to fairly share the resources of the server between all that can kill them. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujurrasicepoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 475<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 6:57:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dozekar Rotation: an FYI</span><hr size=1> Mil for the 3rd time I am NOT asking for nor wanting the drakes to be  FFA.<br>

I don't blame them for this either.&quot;<br>
<br>
The reason most of the Dozekar capable guilds are asking for this is because of the rotation system itself. We as a community agree to share nicely on the big important mobs. These drakes constitute a directly necessary linke to Dozekar. There is NO other use for the named drakes. <br>
<br>
If Dozekar himself was FFA, then it is highly likely that the guilds sniping Nameds (knowingly, not the accidental stuff) would *never* or *extremely rarely* ever be able to even USE those symbols. Sharing is a give and take, and has a long history of being a double-edged sword on this server.<br>
<br>
From my personal observation, this is one of those blatant instances where the tier 1 guilds are taking it in the rear by playing nice.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Edit: Figured I would answer Jurassic with my speculation <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *<br>
<br>
Technically, I would think that all entities that are currently part of the rotation get a say; but the original deal was those guilds who founded a particular rotation (in this case, NB and Tindi) set the policy as long as either is active in the rotation.<br>
<br>
It's a house of cards obviously, and always has been. People depend on the good intentions of everyone involved for this to work. Obviously, from the tone of the posts by NB, Tindi, and BoTS.. they don't feel like people are acting with the best of intentions in regards to this situation.<br>
<br>
I will re-iterate what Milambus pointed out though, just because someone has access to the named now (mainly because half of the rotation thinks people are leaving them up per the agreement)... doesn't mean that same someone would *ever* see them if they went FFA.<br>

<br>
<br>
Yes it does have to be this way, and Emil's post does answer your question.  Doing it any other way is counter to the whole concept of rotating mobs to share amongst those who can benefit from the mobs in question.  The Named without Dozekar are nothing.  Dozekar without the Named is nothing.  To use rotations to your favor (i.e. ensure you get shots at Dozekar) and then ignoring the parts you don't like (i.e. wanting to grab not just your share of Drakes, but everyone's) is greedy and self-centered.<br>
<br>
As for your VP analogy, if the symbols for Doze quests were 8 hour ground spawns all over Velious, I can promise you, NB would have a lot more Doze quests completed.  I would also say that anyone not in a guild that kills Trakanon who collects VP key pieces is wasting their bank space.  I would say the same about VT shards.  If you aren't in a guild actively gathering Emperor keys, you are just wasting your bank space and preventing other players who can use those items better.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I would caution you about trying to make the Named Drakes FFA, as I would make sure that NB took full advantage of said system, if only to prove a point that rotations benefit you a lot more than they do &quot;the big guilds&quot;.  I prefer to share the pie as equally as possible, but if you don't want to play nice on the playground, we can go that way too. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

Because of that (being fair), they are now getting screwed by snipers because they can no longer get whatever it is that the Named mobs drop along with their Dozekar things.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of folks fail to realize that HoT can be cleared (minus Dozekar) by a single well equipped, experienced group and Dozekar can be killed easily with 3 groups of the same.  I know the few times BotS has killed Dozekar we've done it at around 3am or later Eastern time with 17 to 24 people.  It would eventually fall to being a pick-up group situation where people of any guild would group and go kill the mobs and split the things they drop if it went FFA, and that is something that is hard to compete with even for the larger guilds. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 9/16/02 4:10:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilambus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 822<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 7:03:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/profile/fist1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A few months ago...</span><hr size=1> Jurrasic to answer the question: <br>
<br>
Rotations rules/etc are created via discussion.  If all the Doze guilds got together and after discusion agreed to make the named FFA then thats what would happen.  Its not just a simple vote for each rule.  Rotations are package deals that are compromises that the guild on the rotation make.<br>
<br>
So can the rule be changed?  Sure.  Can you convince the other guilds that such a change is best?  Maybe.<br>
<br>
Glyhed/Exiled is a new rotation that took alot of discussing to get the exact details worked out.  All 3 guilds gave thier input until an agreement was made that all could live with. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujurrasicepoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 476<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 7:09:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A few months ago...</span><hr size=1> Thank you, that is what I was looking for, and I was asking for clarification for the future regarding mobs that I imagine will be linked via planar advancement quests in PoP that some guilds will have access to before others, but circumstances may be different then with doze/named.<br>
<br>
For Karadin for the 4th time I have no intention nor does FK of pushing for the drakes to be made FFA, that's not at all what this question was about. It was just a very handy and relevent example. <br>
<br>
And back directly ON the doze/named situation, I hope Borick's excellent post dosen't get buried.<br>
<br>
 If 'elder' rotation guilds kept closer tabs on the named (yes Verant sucks for making them random) there will a lot less 'sniping' from groups camping armour or doze capable guilds looking for symbols.   <p>Jurrasic Epoch <BR>

True, but if every guild capable (or soon-to-be capable) of Doze is acting with good intentions on this rotation.. it should only rarely be an issue.. instead of a constant one.<br>

I guess what I really wanted from my post was to see the gentlemen's agreement between the top tier guilds, and I'm glad that they are doing it so that other guilds can see it, view it, and respect it. I think by doing this, similar problems like this can be avoided in the future when new guilds get onto the rotation.<br>
<br>
Thanks for doing this guys (NB/BoTS/TL and others).<br>

Courtesy of some trains and HoT door openings, ED got to do several mass CR's before we finally gave up and left. The Far Seekers got pushed aside on Friday (don't recall who they said did it) so they came back on Sunday and fairly beat ED to the HoT entrance&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the friday incident, we were the ones that supposidly pushed aside FS. i say supposidly because its just not true.<br>
<br>
i have a good friend in FS and i was casualy talking to him the tues. before that friday, and he told me that FS was going to ToV that friday for the first time. so i said &quot;o really we are going that day also , what time&quot; he said about 7 so i told him that we were supposed to be there at the exact same time. so we talked a bit, and basiclly said tov was big enuff to handled us both and jokeingly talked about more guilds being there at the same time, i offered our assistance if something were to happen and he did the same.. <br>
<br>
well friday came and of course both guilds were forming at the  zone in and were talking about where we were going etc etc, well , we got our force there and headed to the door to set up camp. far seekers came and they said they wanted to camp dozs room and pull to there or somwthing along those lines and we said np, let us clear these mobs and you can go on thru but.<br>
<br>
we got an add on the pull and died. me and my other clicky cleric were bound at zone and went in res everyone. after everyone was resed, we went back to zone in to let FS kill the mobs and move thru while we buffed up and recouped.<br>
<br>
well they had a problem and had a wipeput of their own so right after they perished, me and my other clicky buddy went to res them back, all seemed fine. well, my guild came back to the door to get ready to pull the wurms again to clear them while FS buffed back up and recouped but then eriadoc(sp) didnt something that flattened me<br>
<br>
after we resed them all and made their cr time almost non existant, eraidoc decides to call classless. what a dick, we were at the camp first, we didnt have to give it up, we bowed down to let them try, resed them after they died and we are classless. well to eriadoc i say you can kiss my ass quite frankly.<br>
<br>
we were buffed and ready to go , yall were not ready , we took the camp back to continue our night, and were still willing to let them thru when we cleared it.<br>
<br>
but for some odd reason , just about when the first wurm was about to die, all the cov mobs came rushing in and we died again. (not acusing anyone of doing anything)<br>
<br>
well, we are getting set up and talked about bowing down to FS again but were quite frankly pissed at eriadoccs statement so we didnt give it up. so if FS wants to blame anyone for us not letting them try again, they can blame the unwarented statements of eria. we were more than happy to share until we were called classless for resing you all<br>
<br>
also i noticed reading that post that FS raced two other guilds to the spot. seems to me that we did the same thing friday, so why be upset with us because we were there first. seems to me its the same sitution, except you lost on fri /shrug. sorry you got overran because i dont have hard feelings for your guild, just for eriadocc... <br>
<br>
but since there are 14 or so guilds on the sev rotation, most  of which can do ToV,  traffic jams are going to be a huge problem there in the near future. i forsee huge fights over the next couple months fighting over this spot and guilds wanting to pass to get to doz and the rest of ToV. so do we continue racing for this spot on a daily basis with tensions high with all guilds wanting to equip their guild better or is there a way to coexist in the zone like all other zones. <br>
<br>
maybe the guilds can get together and set up some sort of share agreement that all can benefit from. WK, LoL, SoY, ED, VOLS, VoF, HE, FS, and lots of others all want to be there and are capable of doing it, we have all been fortunate thus far not clashing but if days like sunday continue, there will be a lot fighting and bickering. <br>
<br>
once again i want to say that my guild and I share no bad feelings for FS. we thought everything was ok except for eria's statement, i was shocked to read that FS may of thought we pushed them out when in fact we bowed down to let yall try and did your cr for you(yes you didnt ask for the help, but we did it cus we care). <br>
<br>
know this has nothing to do with doz but i felt it needed to be covered as well.  <p><img src="http://www.thedragonsclaw.org/eq/pics/yalisig.jpg"

For most mobs, this is rather simple and only involves stating that from the time of spawn, that guild has 24 hours to kill it, or it is autopassed to the next guild in the list. Some rotations such as Dozekar or Glyphed/Exiled are a little more complex, and involve more rules.<br>
<br>
For guilds that are attempting to break into rotations, certain ettiquete should be shown. For Tunare for example, sometimes a guild clears part of most the plane late the night before then kills Tunare the next day (still within their 24 hour window). If a guild came into a mostly cleared PoG and took down Tunare I imagine there would be a good deal of contempt for them and perhaps further action.<br>
<br>
The original guilds that set up the rotations lay out the ground rules for them. When new guilds kill that mob and join the rotation, they can not just jump in and push for changes to the rotation.<br>
<br>
Guilds that either don't observe some rotations or break the rules regarding a rotation they are not currently on (such as Dozekar) should probably expect that in the future, the other guilds may get together and decide that they will not recognise that guild as a rotation guild.<br>
<br>
The rotation system is an all or nothing thing. As has been stated previously, people can't pick and choose. If you want to be involved in some rotations you have to keep your guild within the laws of all the rotations.<br>
<br>
Rotations are designed to create order as well as piece of mind. They give all guilds a chance to access pretty much whatever content they are capable of killing on a regular basis without fear of being overrun by the more powerful guilds. In order for the rotation system to protect each guild, those guilds need to work to maintain the integrity of the entire system.<br>

We all know (at least guilds capable of doing at least some rotation mobs know) what the rotations provide and for the most part are fair and reasonable. I also certainly understand the link between the Named and Doze in this particular case. If the Names were to go FFA it would be a mess in there, and no-one wants that. I think the point many have made here is the &quot;named capable, Dozekar incapable&quot; guilds were unaware of the Gentlemen's agreement between the Doze rotation guilds and therefore were doing something quite innocent. They were taking named mobs while farming for equipment in the hopes of picking up a quest item or two. There's no crime in that. This is not an unusual act in the Everquest world. It just so happens there are special circumstances here. I'm quite certain now that it is spelled out most if not all guilds will respect the rotation accordingly.<br>
<br>
I will say this though. From the perspective of a &quot;mid-capable&quot; guild I've spent a lot of time looking through the eyes of the larger guilds in an attempt to see the logic and fairness in the rotations as they are set up now. When discussions like this occur the larger guilds would do well to try and look through our perspective if not just to expediate the process and remove the unnecessary sarcasm and ill-will rampant throughout this thread. We need not travel that road to get to our destination.<br>

Let's try and remember that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The rotation system is an all or nothing thing. As has been stated previously, people can't pick and choose.

<br>
We need to know what those guidelines that the first couple of guilds come up with. It needs to be public. I do believe that has been resolved now as some of the Rotation Guidelines that have previously been a gentlemen's agreement are now here on our boards and soon will be moved to a forum for all of the Rathe to reference.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The original guilds that set up the rotations lay out the ground rules for them.

<br>
Oh really? I thought we were all working together here...I thought that was what the Rathe was all about. Are you saying that all Rotation laws are etched in stone and not up for debate? I think some of the more vocal people on The Rathe will disagree with you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now mind you I don't want to see any changes to what we have now. I just wanted to be clear on what the &quot;laws&quot; of the Rotations were.<br>
<br>
So I thank you all for talking about the Rotations and for explaining the details of the rotations to those of us who are new guilds joining the established rotations.<br>

<br>
First off, I don't pull HoT, so I don't know all the mob positions, but I was under the impression that most if not all of the named drakes were in little side rooms, not sitting in major intersections, so I don't know how those would affect pulls.<br>
<br>
Second, if there is a single named drake that is causing lots of problems because you can't work around it, and moving your camp is not an option, I would say just kill it.  I don't mind only being able to kill 8 drakes instead of 9, and if you feel that what you have done will be a problem, just find out who is next up for Doze and tell them you have an item to MQ w/ someone from that guild.<br>
<br>
What's frustrating for me is to come in, kill Dozekar, and see 3 named drakes up.  It's happened the last two times I've been there for the raid, and at the current time it's getting nothing accomplished but denying content to the guilds capable of killing Dozekar.<br>
<br>
In the same way that I am willing to do what I can to protect the content of the smaller guilds (Ala the Gore/Manaburn thread), I expect the smaller guilds to show the same consideration for other guilds.<br>
<br>
I think that it would be unfair of El'lar Duboth (snaggin a guild name at random) to kill Gorenaire and start timing him with the specific purpose of keeping others from killing him, I think it's unfair of smaller guilds who are incapable of finishing the Doze quests because they cannot kill Dozekar to be killing the named drakes.<br>
<br>
Currently, killing the named drakes if you can't kill Dozekar will net you nothing.  You cannot finish ANY of the quests without killing him, and you are removing anothers ability to finish those quests.<br>
<br>
So please, show others the same respect that you want shown to you.  Put yourselves in the shoes of someone in Tindi or NB that has been working on Dozekar quests for over a year and has as of yet been able to complete it due to the rarity of certain symbols, and look at it from their point of view as someone snags that symbol right out from under them even though they cannot use it.<br>

We went to ToV for the first time this weekend as a guild. I was aware that Doze was on rotation, but I never would have guessed that the named drakes were part of that rotation. If our pullers had run across a named drake, you can bet that I would've been telling them to bring it in (I'm alot braver now that we have a couple of Thurg necro robes and a rez stick). I sure wouldn't have taken the time to ask a larger guild if I was allowed to kill a mob that was not listed on any rotations.<br>
<br>
I was contacted a few times this weekend by people in LoL asking me if we were killing named drakes. I said no and nothing else was said to me. If I had said yes, would I have been dragged into a chat room and then flamed on the boards by guilds that were on the Doze rotation? If it was that big of a problem why didn't the person from LoL explain to me then that they are part of the Doze rotation so I could have avoided my guild being dragged into a situation like this? Now I see that the goal was to try to catch a guild in the act of breaking a server rule that the majority of the server was not even aware of.  <br>
<br>
We moved to ToV for a new challenge, not to inconvenience any guild by killing mobs that were unknowingly on rotation. Even though my guild is not as big as NB, TL, etc I too am very busy with my guild and I don't have time to speak to other guild leaders who are just as busy to search for hidden rules. And I don't think it should be my responsibility to contact rotational guilds when I am merely farming a zone for armor with no intent of taking down the rotational mob. <br>
<br>
I come to the RTA boards for information on server rules and I do my very best to keep my guild informed of those rules. In fact, I believe that most guilds that are capable of raiding the high end zones also come to the RTA so they are also aware of our server rules. If the rules are not listed here don't expect them to be followed, instead expect misunderstandings to happen frequently. <br>
<br>
Thank you Gromm for posting this on the boards so all the guilds are now informed about the rules concerning this rotation. I hope that it will be respected now that all the guilds are aware of this special condition concerning the Doze rotation. I would like to see any other special rules and/or considerations on any other rotational mobs posted here also so we can avoid these 4 page threads because of a simple misunderstanding.<br>
<br>
Far Seekers will respect the named drakes as part of the Doze rotation. If we become part of the Doze rotation and want to see things changed or if we run into a problem with the nameds being in our way while hunting in HoT then we will discuss it at that time.  <p><center>

Gromm, re-read my post.  <br>
<br>
Just because BotS doesn't have to worry about getting pushed out of HoT entrance, doesn't mean that Doze rotation guilds pushing through or forcing out another guild is not an issue.  <br>
<br>
My post was not inflamitory and it is related to the Doze rotation because it does affect my guild and other guilds still farming HoT.  Yalinie's post was a bit inflamitory so I can only assume you are referring to her post.<br>
<br>
If Doze ettiquette concerning moving over smaller guilds and ruining there camp and raid time, why should the smaller guilds recognize a rotation mob &quot;package&quot;?<br>
<br>
I have already stated my views on the &quot;package&quot; so I will not rehash it but I will say to say guilds farming HoT can't kill mobs that are in the way of pulls is ridiculous.  There are bigger fish to fry and the smaller guilds are not capable of doing the bigger fish hence the reason we are farming HoT. <p>God Bless America!<BR>
