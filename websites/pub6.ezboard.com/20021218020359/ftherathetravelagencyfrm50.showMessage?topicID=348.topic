I see that Fallen Shadows are still around and that's awesome to see,. and also those in Tempters of Fate are still around.. i used to be in that guild with the sweetbottoms =) I wanted to know about some of the guilds history around here,.. i remember along time ago that the server split and half of the people went to the Zeb server,. but i remember that there was a guild my friend was in before he moved,. Emef 'Aitch,.. does anyone know why they were disbanded? And were they went to? Are the Champions of Norrath still around? One of the reasons why i loved EQ was the whole guild vs guild thing,.. wasn't really a war,.. but sometimes you get to see some really neat things happen.. like on my server, 2 of the uberest guilds merged to become 1 guild while some people left to start new uber guilds,.thanks for any info you have and any time that i've spent <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.cox.net/tommythepornstar/Aeri.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tils>Tils</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.loopi.co.uk/bounce.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 382<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/28/02 9:09:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=348.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.loopi.co.uk/tils2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need some info on Rathe history</span><hr size=1> Ok lemme try to answer...my memory might not quite be as good as it was so sorry if i get some facts wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
You had for the first year or so the following big guilds (no specific order)<br>
<br>
Emef 'Aitch (MFH)<br>
Clan Icewind (CIW)<br>
Knights of The Eternal Good (KEG)<br>
Brotherhood of the Spider<br>
<br>
The first three were allied for a small amount of time to kill boss mobs like naggy / vox etc.<br>
<br>
Then keg decided they would split off because of indifferences with the CIW and MFH.<br>
<br>
At this time there was no rotations on the Rathe...things basically were FFA and eventually this was decided that it did not work. So now if forget his name from CIW set up a calendar system for the planes and two dragons (pre kunark).<br>
<br>
Im not sure if this was pre kunark or after I forget which however Brotherhood of the Spider changed to Blood of the Spider because of GM problems.<br>
<br>
I also think Tindi Losi was also created some time around here however at the time they wernt very big.<br>
<br>
Same goes for Noble House and something? Blade who were different guilds at the time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kunark</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This all went on for a while ...if i got my time scales right basically into Kunark. <br>
<br>
Rotations started to be a normal thing on mobs like trakanon. However mobs like Venril Sathir were kept FFA and there were still lots of confrontations with who got into the court yard. <br>
<br>
Raging Fury and Spirit of Tunare (2 joined guilds forget names) I believe were made around here sometime.<br>
<br>
Around this time I beleive Noble blade was created by the who guilds mentioned earlier merging or it could have been sometime earlier again if forget when it acutally happened...maybe someone can say when.<br>
<br>
Veeshans Peak was entered 1-2 guilds around this time aswell.<br>
<br>
Then we had the first of two server splits. This was pushed because the rathe was well very full at the time..one of the bigger servers with a good 2k+ people on it on peak times which at the time was big.<br>
<br>
TL, SoT, RF and NB slowly moved up in size around this time contesting lots of mobs.<br>
<br>
Zeb server was created and KEG / CIW left the server to go to it. Many other guilds and people left at the time. Also at this time some of the MFH people left the server aswell and it severerly inpacted MFH enough for them to disband with some of them leaving game and some of them filtering off into other guilds one being Champions of Norraith.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Velious</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You then pretty much ended up with these guilds as the bigger guilds (no specific order) going into Velious. BotS at this time had a very large head start on the other 4 guilds so the other guilds were on &quot;catch up&quot;.<br>
<br>
Tindi Losi<br>
Blood of the Spider<br>
Spirit of Tunare<br>
Noble Blade<br>
Raging Fury<br>
<br>
Then the next and last server split happened on the server which ment Raging Fury leaving the server to go to the UK (AB) Server.<br>
<br>
There was a lot of competition on camps at this time however BotS got into Ntov much earlier than the other guilds. As TL and NB wernt on giant faction and SoT were behind BotS by maybe a good 6 months. <br>
<br>
Sleepers tomb was entered by all 4 guilds at different times in Velious.<br>
<br>
Guilds decided to not bother with factions so much once they had gotten their quest armours and NToV was eventually cleared by all 4 guilds and put onto a roation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Luclin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You then move into Luclin where things stayed the same for sometime with rotations on mobs and places like NToV.<br>
<br>
Vex Thal was entered by Bots at sometime during luclin however the main 4 guilds were all clearing Ssra and the other boss mobs around Luclin pretty much.<br>
<br>
Eventually Spirit of Tunare disbanded because of Issues within the guild. Towards the latter end of Luclin (few months before PoP). Players from this guild filtered into other guilds like TL, BotS, NB and Visionaries of Fire and others. Some of them creating a new guild called Shadows of the Eclipse.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PoP</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Then Planes of Power came out.<br>
<br>
TL got into Vex Thal at this time just after PoP came out.<br>
<br>
<br>
You ended up with the following large guilds.<br>
<br>
Noble Blade<br>
Blood of the Spider<br>
Tindi Losi<br>
<br>
You also have other guilds to mention who are doing pretty well on the server...my apologies if i missed other guilds but these are the names which come to mind at the moment.<br>
<br>
Visionaries of Fire<br>
Legend of Marr<br>
Frayed knott<br>
Shadows of the Eclipse <br>
<br>
To find out how their going now best to just check out their web sites <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
btw....Ive tried to make this as &quot;neutral&quot; as possible ..if I offended any one or guild sorry and please post any thing i got wrong I havent posted to argue when things happened and whos best bla bla just trying to help this person out.<br>
<br>
I have also been on this server since the first month of EQ so I do have experience of what and when things happened..just forget the order :P<br>

However this time I think this appropriate to make a reply.<br>
<br>
I think it could be interesting to read how some guilds evolved in time and how they were created. So to start ill give a resume of how Spirit of Tunare evolved.<br>
<br>
It was July 1999, I was playing my wizard (Ertay) at that time, he is my first character I ever played. At the lvl of 22 I got approached by someone (Jonus) that wanted to start a guild.  Since I knew already allot of people from real life that played EQ I made the offer and most of them were interested.<br>
<br>
So we went to chat and I created the guild with the 9 others.<br>
And then it happened, on the 24th of July 1999 I got a tell from GM Zatozia that she was ready to give me the tag.<br>
<br>
And so SoT was formed with his 10 founders (Jonus, Karadoc, Darck, Zelph, Sunwolf, Rhymirez, Melodia, Bavo, Westy and Ertay (Clerise)) Most of them quit in the early days but some might probably ring a bell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
<br>
We proceeded as a small guild and had lots of fun. On a certain point we met another small guild (Saxxon's) and we teamed up allot. After a while we debated on merging and gave it a try, after 2 months the guild split off again as the members preferred to stay small and others wanted to grow.<br>
This is also the time where Shei joined the guild I believe. He just started the game and loved it.<br>
<br>
So we proceed to kill things, lvl up and made friends. At that point we encountered Shane and Cassidy, they were also leaders of a guild (Guardians of Antonica).  After a while we decided to try and merge again, this time it was a success and we were almost ready to get into fear and hate or kill Vox or Naggy.<br>
<br>
Since the merge SoT grew fast, new members joined and the lvl went up. The rathe gets split to Zeb and MFH falls apart a bit later.  Some of the members joined SoT (names that come to my mind are Thundaron, Nycah, Haxx, ....) Suddenly we had people that knew how to do things and our evolution went up very fast. From old Cazic to AoW, SoT came, engaged and won (sometimes with allot of difficulties but we won) After Luclin the golden years were over and people grew tired of the game and especially the time sinks. They quit or started on another server, replacement was not found fast enough and we could not kill what we were used to kill.  People got demoralized and quit more and more.<br>
<br>
As a final on the 19th of August more then 3 years later, the curtain falls down and SoT got disbanded. People scatter around the world, some quit, some joined other guilds and some restarted a guild. Nevertheless I think SoT had a nice impact on the server. I know we have had some problems sometimes but every guild caused some once in a while.<br>
<br>

I think this is pretty accurate but if you find an error feel free to reply with your view.<br>

<br>
<br>
Brotherhood of the Spider was disbanded for some reason that I can no longer recall (training KEG in a plane or somthing?) and reformed as a backup guild Blades of Destiny before finally getting the BOTS tag back as Blood of the Spider.<br>
<br>
Frayed Knot has an interesting history, I am curious how many guild names you will recognize here.<br>
<br>
A large percentage came from the Far Runners, a very large but not really uber guild from the time of the mfh/ciw/keg/bots days that eventually imploded due to various issues with the leadership.<br>
<br>
 Many members went to other guilds, and a few new guilds were formed. One of which was Frayed Knot, begun by Alika. a very small and avowed 'non political' guild which barely mustered the people to form the guild.  <br>
<br>
Allied with them were the Jaded Band (also many former Far Runners) and Eternal Archons (a guild of Electronic Arts Canada friends and co-workers, as well as gaming clan friends. My original family.)   This was a planar raiding alliance known as FrEAKs at the time. <br>
<br>
Come the  server split, JB left the server with a few remaining who went under the FK banner. More ex Far Runners started flocking to the FK family.<br>
<br>
EA also fragmented sadly, members going to BoTS, TL and the remainder also joining the FK banner. The guild suddenly doubled in size and had to do a lot of adapting. <br>
<br>
At the same time Xaleen's Cavaliers became the King's Advocates, and somehow ended up FK (not sure on that part of the story) and as well the small family clans of Circle of Magics and Clan of Absolute Virtue were absorbed by the FK juggernaut. <br>
<br>
All these disparate entities gelled well together towards common goals, and larger and larger and bigger things started to happen and we began the classic progression from planar to Kunark highend and epics to loading up on HoT armor to a million wipes on Vindi till we got it down and now here we are. It's been a long strange ride.<br>

<br>
PreKunark I know there were many old timers that came from guilds like Band of the Black Hand.  Somewhere in the mix they formed/joined a (from what I'm told) larger guild from back then, Vanquished Souls.  Our current guild leader, Levlenna, started in Shining Thread which then merged with VS (I think).<br>
<br>
Once Kunark came out(I could be wrong on this, might have been just before Kunark), VS fell apart from too many members with not enough management.  Bradan then decided to form Visionaries of Fire with the remaining members.<br>
<br>
At this time VoF raided at US times, but had many European members.  Somewhere along the line, (and this was a big step in the time zone change of the guild) Bradan got frustrated from selfish members and joined KEG, and VoF started allying with Darkbreed of Norrath to kill Naggy/Vox and clear the planes.  There was a lot of tension with the alliance, which lead to Darr leading several members from the guild to form Hands of Fate.  At his point the US side of the guild took a big hit from the formation of HoF and the current alliance with DBoN. *enter me into VoF* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   More and more US members left to join DBoN, and finally the current leader, Cemedar (sp?), left for DBoN as well.<br>
<br>
With leaders/officers leaving/quitting the game (guild could have easily folded at this time), VoF's primary member base was now European.  Needless to say the alliance with DBoN ended.  Kenau/Levlenna took the initiative and became the new leader of VoF.  The guild then changed its raid times (granted at this time it was only plane/small epic raids) to start so the European members could attend without having to stay up all night. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We had an alliance with Xaleen's Cavileers for plane raids, which eventually split up and became King's Advocates.<br>
<br>
Velious came shortly after this, and VoF as a European guild took shape.  As we gained more European members we were able to kill more on our own so the alliance with King's Advocates ended, most of them (maybe all?) going to FK, as Jur said.  Oddly enough, during the start of Velious, talks were made about the merging of VoF and Hands of Fate.  The merge never went through though, and shortly after that HoF disbanded.  Several HoF members eventually rejoined VoF.<br>
<br>
From there, VoF went through the usual guild ups and downs.  We were always a family guild back then, so many members left VoF to join SoT (A guild most of us liked and respected as good friends until its breakup) who raided much more than us (and was far more powerful).  We slowly inched our way up killing VS, PoG nameds, and Trakanon.  Keeping up with this slow progression, we slowly but surely tried more mobs, and found we wanted to raid more than we had in the past.  Gaining members from the split up of Ratio Decendi (still preLuclin if I remember right), we continued to grow from there to where we are now.<br>
<br>
With Luclin, we started raiding some of the harder Velious mobs, and easier Luclin named.  Nearing the end of Luclin we began killing higher end Velious mobs (At this time we gained some old SoT members that were friends to many in the guild).  Since the release of PoP we've continued to try out the harder Velious and Luclin mobs, and will probably continue at least until Velious is done.<br>
<br>
Now, we still raid at European times, but have a member base pretty well scattered around the world.  We have several members from Holland, UK, France, Belgium, Australia, Hong Kong, the US, military stationed here and there, and probably many others I can't think of.  It's been an interesting evolution of the guild, but a hell of a fun ride. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The original BoTS was disbanded for &quot;training&quot; the guild Bloodline of the Bear in fear. If I remember right, BloB cleared the plane except for Cazic, and BoTS was called in to kill him. BloB hadn't left the plane when BoTS zoned in, and some BoTS members got aggro. I think their camp spot was the same as BloB's, and of course all the mobs trained in and wiped everyone.

I was also in Fear at the time BotS was disbanded. We were at the north wall safe spot area slowly pulling mobs with around 20 people. At that time it was a fairly small number for a Fear raid, so we could only handle a couple of mobs at a time.<br>
<br>
BotS zoned in and was meant to do a West Wall breakin, but somehow, some members ended up training us at our camp. I don't really think that BotS should have been disbanded, as it really seemed to be a knee jerk reaction. Anyway, it happened, but really has had no lasting effect on them except for being Blood rather than Brotherhood.<br>
<br>
I think the real reason of reforming as Blood rather than Brotherhood is because the SLR's didn't like being part of a brotherhood.<br>

In the begining, the two guilds that went at it were Knights of Eternal Good and Brotherhood of the Spider. At the time, KEG was probably the stronger, especially during the time of the Triad (the alliance between MFH, KEG, and CIW). Bots formed it's own alliance with Knights of the Iron Cross and another guild which name escapes me, but that alliance was not long lived either.<br>
<br>
The planes opened up and suddenly, there was more than two places to raid  . It was the conflicts that existed between guilds for the vital plane of fear resources that spawned the calander. At the time, the calander was just a forum set up by...I frankly forget. I believe it was a paladin in Champions of Norrath at the time. It was a courtesy system where people would post their intention to raid a plane, however it was turned into a reservation system. <br>
<br>
By Kunark, the tide was changing. BoTS was the first to kill Trakanon, and was able to get themselves the vital level 60 spells first by farming Juggs and protectors. KEG was the first to down Venril Sathir, and were the only guild who could do it for quite a while. KEG would whipe on Trak though a few times till they nailed it, and BoTS never seemed to be in that big of a rush to kill Venril (probably because they discovered the quest to Veshaan's Peek and were working on gearing up for it.) BoTS was into VP first, with KEG following not too far behind. It was during this era that BoTS really took command of the title of #1 guild on the server, but they still had stiff competition.<br>
<br>
KEG played catch up, and was still pretty close in terms of ability. BoTS however was now probably the stronger guild, if only by a small margin. Then there was alot of down time between expansions, and eventually people took breaks and retired as there was nothing much left to kill. Until velious...<br>
<br>
Velious saw guilds spread out alot more, giving the tier 2 guilds alot more chances to raid, albiet old content. KEG was picking up members, determined to catch up to BoTS. Still, there were alot of tier 2 guilds out there at the time that content was still being raced two. This was the expansion that saw mobs with over 32k of hit points, and the birth of the 10 minute fight  . KEG was coming on strong, but was still behind in the race for the new key to uber loot dungeon_03 (aka Sleepers Tomb). During this era, it was announced that the Rathe and Eci were to be split. <br>
<br>
MFH was torn asunder because of this, as many of their raid oriented people wanted the chance to excel on a new server, and get the chance to stretch out from the crowding on this server. <br>
<br>
KEG left this server very strong, and was the top guild on Zeb until internal conflict ripped it apart. The core of KEG still lives on as Final Sanctuary, and they have gone back to the smaller more decidated playerbase that was their trademark. Nowadays, some ex-KEG people can be found among the members of Crusaders of Pililo (also left this server during the split).<br>
<br>
CIW disbanded not too long after Stormhammer was created. Several members of Clan icewind left Zebuxoruk to join Snaggle in his own guild (Snaggle was an ex-KEG warrior, and one of the best stradegists to play on this server). <br>
<br>
As for me?  I am an old name probably long forgotten except by the very old players on this server.  I was around much of the conflict at the time, as I was an Admin here.  I am also a historian so to speak, and I have taken great joy in watching the evolution of a community over the period of several years. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=309481">Manas Pineblade</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
