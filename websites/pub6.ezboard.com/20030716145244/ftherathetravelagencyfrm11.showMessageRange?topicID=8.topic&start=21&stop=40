<br>
If any guild can kill a god by themselves, by no means does anyone have any right to tell them what to do with that loot.  If CT was up 10x in a row, killed 10x in a row by non bb guilds WITH 0 assistance and 10x in a row they were given to keg, so be it.  <br>
<br>
The problem i saw was a guild that has (at least no one will answer yes or no, so i assume no) never killed ct completely by themselves, therefore chances are they would not have kiled ct w/o 6 vetran keg members - which would have lead to mfh bb'ing - hence rotation.<br>
<br>
Same rules would apply to trades (for the less loved ~.~ guilds).  if we make a trade to loot, we stay out of zone.  If ct is killed alone, we come in and get the loot.<br>
<br>
And if the items were obtained soley by non-bb killing, then they would not fit in to the rotation of bb.<br>
<br>
Again, i dont think keg did anything wrong - i think the rules simply need modification. <p><P align=center>

a)  Change the rotation to a per week baises?  Or leave it as it is now?  (If its changes I would suggest waiting until FoR got called up on a god killing first)<br>
<br>
b)  Members of a BB guild can not be killing in a plane (except on thier own dates) unless they are the BB guild on call.  (This may not be stated clearly, basicaly what Emil said above.)<br>
<br>
c)  Guilds can do as they please with epic loot.<br>
<br>
d)  It was suggested elsewhere that BB guilds could quit being a BB guild just to help someone clear the plane.  So, to head off ths abuse, BB guilds must give 2 week notice before they quit being a BB guild.  Or at least they can not help with a plane clearing for 2 weeks after thet reite from BB status. <br>
<br>
e)  This one goes with rule d.  If a former BB guild wishes to become a BB guild again, they must wait 2 weeks after reapplying, at which point they will be readded at the bottom of the BB rotation.  This means a 4 week lose of BB status for a guild if they quit and then rejoin. <p>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

<br>
I donot support any policy that is preventing whole guilds from participateing with thier friends in any raid. <br>
<br>
In my opinion it is bad enough that they are restricted to 6 per guild/alliance but this is a neccessary evil to prevent piggy backing.<br>
<br>
But to say totaly and unconditionally if you belong to guild A you can never set foot in the planes unless you are with guild A is wrong. <br>
<br>
If you have a valid arguement on why this is not wrong let me hear them. but I put this to you.<br>
<br>
If I said Uberguild_01 you can never go to Chardok with anyone but members of Uberguild_01 what would you say? <br>
I know what I would say STFU and get a life.<br>
<br>
The only thing I can see from restricting to the degree of saying no member of an epic guild can participate in another guilds raid is pandamonium. I would never want to be told who I can and cant go with to the planes ever. <p>Vincecross Dhark'baen

Can ya stop with the FFA crap already?  It's not going to happen.  We'll find a way to work it out so as to be as fair as possible across the board, kk??<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Vincecross on this.  No one should be able to tell me that I cannot go to the Planes with United Necros, INC., just because I am in an Epic guild (let's cease calling these guilds/alliances BB...the term makes me cringe).<br>
<br>
Perhaps we can compromise on this and say that rather than 6 invites from Epic, only 3 are allowed.  (I know, this is getting complicated.)  If the guild in the plane does decide to give the Epic loot to someone in an Epic guild/alliance, that is their option.  If that someone is not a part of the invites, they wait outside until the god is being taken down.<br>
<br>
NOTE:  Epic's invited into the plane to assist in clearing and/or taking down the god are allowed as many peeps as they feel are necessary to accomplish the deed.<br>
<br>
Someone have a better idea?<br>
<br>
Other than that, I like the idea of Epic's rotating weeks rather than sitting and waiting for weeks on in to be called in.  It lets the peeps sorta choose who they will call in if needed; however, we may run into instances where the Epic will be called in more than once during their week on server crashes/resets.<br>
<br>
Milambus' idea on Epic removing themselves form the Epic rotation is a good one and something that should be incorporated into our current rules (if nothing else comes out of this).<br>
<br>
I'm rather disappointed in the lack of Epic guild/alliance input on this thread.  This is, after all, something that is for them, and needs to be something that they can agree with.  Perhaps a meeting between these folks should be set up so that they can discuss it amongst themselves and present what they would like to see.<br>

<br>
Looking at what I posted above, I think I paraphrasing Emil incorrectly.  My post above shoudl read...<br>
<br>
---<br>
If you are an Epic guild (you're welcome Edwina) and you will be looting an Epic item then you can not be in the plane for its clearing and God killing.  However, if you will not be looting an Epic pieces if they should happen to drop, then your guild may have up to 6 members there as invites.<br>
---<br>
<br>
I don't know if that is any better really, but it was what I meant to say at least.<br>
<br>
Regarding the weekly rotation:  each plane would have its own rotation, such that no guild would be on call for both planes at once.<br>
<br>
In addition I would like to state this.  I personally believe the Epic Rotation, was designed to &quot;fairly&quot; distrubute this epic items among the Epic Guilds.  Why else was it a rotation in the first place?  Why not just make a list of approved Epic guilds that could be called in, and let those doing the call in chose which guild to call in.<br>

I'd even go as low as to agree with 2 people.  <br>
<br>
This whole entire argument and changing of rules stems from 2 guilds not wanting KEG to get more &quot;goodies&quot; than them, because KEG is more &quot;social&quot; than them.  Thats as much &quot;changing&quot; of the rules as we'll agree to, to accomodate this paranoia =P<br>

<br>
Qwai, there are other pullers out there that are very good (perhaps not up to your standards) that do not belong to Epic guilds/alliances.  Are they also not allowed in the zone?  Isn't that getting just a little ridiculous?  Why isn't cutting the number of Epid invites down to 3, or even 2, enough satisfy you?  <br>
<br>
There are literally hundreds of players in our world of Norrath, and each of them *could* make a difference in a raid.  This stuff about &quot;the guild should take the god down themselves&quot; didn't come up when the discussions about invites came up.  It was agreed that the posting entity could invite whomever they wanted, so long as they followed the 6-person rule.  I realize that this may be a difficult concept to fathom, but KEG has many friends outside of it's walls, and those friends like to have them around.<br>
<br>
Cut the number of Epic invites down.  Go to a weekly rotation for possible call-in.  (Suggest that there be a short time for FR to get their chance to be called in and get an epic piece...say 2 weeks?)  What do the Epic's say? <p><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Edwina Nytengayle<br> </strong></font></center>

<br>
Yes Edwina, we will continue to be in a BB rotation that isn't creating rules just to spite KEG and their social status on the server.  And I think you know that is exactly what is going on as well as we do.  <br>
<br>
If not, we will go and do our own thing.  Continue to post on the calendar and continue to follow the rules of the 6 per guild invite.  And leave the squabbling and pettiness to those within the rotation.<br>
<br>
Plus I think that 3 members in a plane for a BB guild should *only* pertain to days that have a God up.  My guild has a right to have 6 members hang out with their friends on non-God nights as much as anybody else does without somebody getting their knickers in a twist.<br>

This whole entire argument and changing of rules stems from 2 guilds not wanting KEG to get more &quot;goodies&quot; than them, because KEG is more &quot;social&quot; than them. Thats as much &quot;changing&quot; of the rules as we'll agree to, to accomodate this paranoia =P&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking at it from a KEG perspective, i can see why you think this way.  Looking at it from a BotS,MFH,CIW,FR,DBN perspective, its not to keep keg from gettin gooties, but rather, to ensure that all 6 get a fair shot at the chance that a guild cant kill a god all alone.  By suggesting this rule, I am in no way guaranteeing BotS more loot; rather, i am looking to ensure that all 6 get even shots at the epic loot.  In the end, BotS will be looking at just about the same about of loot coming to the guild.<br>
<br>
I'm open for debate on the 3 member rule.  I would like to focus in on the 3 members: would it be the 3 members looting the item? (in fear: a necro, a enchanter, a wizard, a sk; in hate: a mage, a paly, a rogue, a ranger).<br>
<br>
It's still a hard call.  By removing the 'bb' element from a non-epic guild raid, you prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt that bb was not required, thus freeing yourselves from any cross server speculation.  This would offer no room for suspicion / cross examination from anyone on the server.  <br>
<br>
It would leave the naysayers without material to gripe, and would still allow for friendly gifts / negotiated trades to take place in game, without reprocussions.<br>
<br>
It would also shed light on exactly how needed bb is.  I hear that bb is virtually obsolete - maybe it is.  Honestly i dont know how needed it it.  This would prove interesting to me, at the very least.<br>
<br>
It seem regulated on the surface, but isnt that exactly what the callendar is? Regulation, to ensure unbiassed sharing of planar loot to server sanctioned entities, regardless of social standing in the community?  I'd like to take this model and apply it to epic loot.<br>
<br>
Don't think of the suggestion as a was to thwart keg, think of it as a way to evenly distribute the epic stuff amongst the 6 epic guilds.<br>

<br>
a) Change the rotation to a per week baises? Or leave it as it is now? (If its changes I would suggest waiting until FoR got called up on a god killing first)<br>
<br>
I would prefer it remain a situational rotation.  Perhaps BB will not be needed for 3 weeks., then needed 2x(server patches) in 1 week.  This would go against the sharing policy that im striving for.<br>
<br>
b) Members of a BB guild can not be killing in a plane (except on thier own dates) unless they are the BB guild on call. (This may not be stated clearly, basicaly what Emil said above.)<br>
<br>
Yes, to ensure, without doubts, that bb was in fact, needed OR not needed.<br>
<br>
c) Guilds can do as they please with epic loot.<br>
<br>
Again, yes.  If a non epic guild loots/kills a god with epic loot on it, they can keep it, bank it, work toward it, give it away or trade for something they may find more useful.<br>
<br>
d) It was suggested elsewhere that BB guilds could quit being a BB guild just to help someone clear the plane. So, to head off ths abuse, BB guilds must give 2 week notice before they quit being a BB guild. Or at least they can not help with a plane clearing for 2 weeks after thet reite from BB status. <br>
<br>
e) This one goes with rule d. If a former BB guild wishes to become a BB guild again, they must wait 2 weeks after reapplying, at which point they will be readded at the bottom of the BB rotation. This means a 4 week lose of BB status for a guild if they quit and then rejoin. <br>
<br>
d)<br>
e)<br>
I would strongly suggest that bb guild be defined as an attribute, not a vocation.  In that, i mean if you can kill boss 5 pos, you are bb.  Whether or not you choose to be in bb program does not give you licence to get invited on non bb raids, thus heading back to the questionable actions that brought this entire topic up.  If you are bb 'enabled'  Then you enter in the bb rotation.  If you dont want to bother with it, then you still should be disallowed to enter plains on god days unless you have that day booked. -see b)<br>

On non god days, i would agree that the 6 member rule still stands.  My concerns with 6 on god day is that it can make or break a raid, thus cheating the bb guild slated from bb'ing. <p><P align=center>

I will no support a total bar of any one guild from any plane for any period of time.<br>
Jer has already conceded down to 2 or 3. and I really thinks thats the minimum you can get with out totaly infringeing on someones right to play.<br>
<br>
Qwai not sure what your exact suggestion means. Could you Elaborate. If I am understanding it correctly I would respond that there is no reason to send any one other then the BB in to do the job, haveing any other BB people could cause more lag or miscommunication could cause problems. Not to mention that there is no reason to document loot because it becomes public knowledge any way. Also we arent here to diseminate loot fairly we are here to give you a chance at the loot, you already get more chances they lets say MCOD  people do, and they have people who want epics, are they any less important then a BB person? If we were to do a loot rotation why not have everyone else on the calendar on the epic loot rotation.<br>
<br>
Lets keep the suggestions here fair for all.  <p>Vincecross Dhark'baen

<br>
In regards to posting entities being able to take down a god alone.  You are suggesting limiting the number of Epic peeps invited to raids, but there is nothing limiting the number of invites from non-Epic's (other than the 6 per posting guild/alliance thing).  United Necros can invite 18 others (no more than 6 from any one entity).  Doesn't this &quot;turn the tide&quot; of whether they can or cannot take down the god &quot;by themselves&quot;?  Reality check, folks.  Having 18 invites would make a raid.<br>
<br>
Rather than the headache of trying to figure out whether or not an entity is capable, limit the number of Epic invites on god days (6 on non-god days).<br>
<br>
As for the weekly rotation, I have reservations about that (but willing to concede to the decision of the Epics), but feel that the set rotation is really the way it should go.<br>
<br>
As for the epic loot given freely from the posting entity to those 2 or 3 Epic invites, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> that is their choice</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and nothing that anyone else has the right to dictate. <p><center><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Edwina Nytengayle<br> </strong></font></center>
