As for the items on the table I strongly feel the epic rotation is the best way to go. Most of the complaints I have seen from the larger guilds was not that they needed more gear but they wanted a shot at more of the epic quest items. With that said clearing to isle 6 in sky is a good indicator of skill and ability. <br>
<br>
Should the majority vote on 2 days rights for Class A/BBG  then the test of skill must be more difficult or we will have the calendar over run again with to many people and not enough days. So in this instance I would say to clear Trak with 75% in attendance. (no invites is going a bit far)<br>
<br>
Should the rules be in violation I suggest suspension of posting rights for 30 days for the first offence, 60days for the second, and on the third you lose all posting privileges. <p>Cassidy Valiance <BR>

I've always felt that if you have the numbers to qualify to post on the calendar, then it's your OWN damn business who you take with you...

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The key word is compromise. What have the little guilds compromised? The Rathe is too old to be using this system. Trakanon is not a good measure of a BB guild..reason being we all can't race to Trakanon against guilds who can play all day. CIW has attempted Trak 2 times. It took Bots and Tindi Losi(KEG) 10+ tries to win..20? If you want CIW to agree you will make fair rules. If not, then we will see you in Hate and Fear, and the GM won't say a god damn thing.<br>
<br>
What i will agree to:<br>
<br>
40 planes level people to post.<br>
<br>
BB guilds qualify when they clear Isle 6 in Sky.<br>
<br>
No training days/<br>
<br>
No 2/3 rule<br>
<br>
6 max invites from a posting guild that is not scheduled.<br>
<br>
No extra days for BB guilds(compromise).<br>
<br>
BB must rotate on a list to help younger guilds. No favoritism. BB guilds only eligible for Quest items.<br>
with 40+ people min to post, BB should never have to help).<br>
<br>
Conclusion: This still is a shitty system, and all it does is make the larger more capable guilds &quot;GIVE&quot;...yes give you what you can not earn without a calendar. This is the last offer of compromise CIW will agree to. New admins can contact me at qwai@eqraid.org.<br>

I hold no ill-will towards anyone and always seek new friends from any guild in-game. <br>
<br>
<br>
I personally refuse to be bullied in to anything. I think that the general population of planable guilds can come to a concensus of fair terms. Part of the problem is that the current calendar software is inadequate. There is a huge difference between fielding 24 planable people to take 6 guests in and clear hate and fielding enough planables to take the deep islands in sky or kill trakanon. Here are some suggestions that I have:<br>
<br>
1) Seperate calendar usage levels...<br>
   can schedule fear/hate/island 1 of sky with a guild that has 24 planables.<br>
   figure out the levels and other things that are to be scheduled in stages and qualifications...<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Break out the daily scheduling... if a guild intends on going in at 8pm and leaving at 3am on a friday night... why do they have that entire 24 hours scheduled.. because the calendar cannot handle it. It would be EXTREMELY beneficial to have better tracking as to when people are in the planes and/or when gods, dragons, etc. are alive.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) The Big Brother... lemme give you a tour thing is non-sense. If there is a day when no guild has a timeslot scheduled, be it an off-time or whatever, then perhaps that time could be used. In general people should get planes experience by being guests or ajoining guilds. Part of what makes this whole system work is that people need to be polite, friendly, and maintain a good reputation in order to find a way to go. This pretty much keeps the general lguk type riff-raff out of the planes because people dont invite or tolerate it.<br>
<br>
<br>
4)Who can be invited... it is my opinion that if a guild has the appropriate levels to schedule a raid as per the level restrictions mentioned in point 1, then they can invite whoever they want. If they are only able to post on the calendar for hate because they only have 24 planables and they want to invite 20 people to go with them, so be it. OOOOh they snuck in an extra planes date because the other guild invited them on their raid.. ok. They would be posting sep anyway.<br>
<br>
<br>
5) Rathe High Council of Guilds... I think a council of guild leaders on the rathe is needed. There is one main purpose... to establish a reputation of honor that will allow solid communication with CS so that when things go wrong in-game, the council may get it rectified. This will help prevent Big Bully guilds from taking advantage of other paying customers.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I am volenteering my services to provide the calendar / scheduling / communication software to support my ideas as needed. If you use the word compromise in any sentence building this new system, then the proposal is not right. There is a fair way to handle this and respect every customer's time and efforts. The only compromises will need to be made by those who have expectations that they somehow are more worthy than others.<br>

<br>
<br>
&quot;A little birdy&quot; told me that for us to do so would be 1 petition away from a problem. The one thing I do suggest is that anyone agreeing with the calendar &quot;sign off&quot; to the terms as well...ie: <br>
<br>
&quot;I hereby acknowledge that if I am to break any one of the above rules, I and any posting entities involved are subject to the repremands outlined herein&quot;<br>
<br>
In english...if they sign off saying they accept the punishment outline..then thats it. Also...it needs to be understood that if they are speaking on behalf of the guild, it's also their responsibility to inform ALL people in their guild / alliance of the rules...this way they cant say &quot;well, I wasnt there..they didnt know&quot;.<br>
