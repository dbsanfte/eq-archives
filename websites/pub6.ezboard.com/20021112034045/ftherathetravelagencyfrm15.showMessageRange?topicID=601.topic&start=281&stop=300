To say that Americans have no right to say they are part of a certain nationality because maybe their great great grandparents moved here say in the 1900's is not really right.  In my city of about 380,000, we have many ethnic neighborhoods, we have a Polish, Hungarian, Arabic, German and Oriental.  And each summer we have festivals in each of these neighborhoods to celebrate their heritages.  So, IMO, these people, who are Americans, are also Polish, Hungarian, etc.  They are keeping their heritage alive in their own small neighborhoods, so to say that just because they are American that they have no rights to say that they are part of a different country is pretty much wrong. <p>Love<BR>Momma T<BR>58th Templar<BR>LoM Induction Council =)<BR><BR>"And sometimes I think, I'm the only one who feels like going nowhere is like giving up..."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugaludina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galudina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/26/02 12:16:11 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fatcatdesign.org.uk/galudinasigside.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: lol</span><hr size=1> I think some of you are missing the point and mixing up the difference between been &quot;part&quot; Scottish/Irish etc and heritage <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A LOT (significant number) of Americans I speak to claim they are part Scottish, what they really mean is that they have Scottish ancestors, thats great, it great for them to know where there roots began etc.<br>
<br>
What a lot of them are not is PART Scottish, to be part Scottish you need to have had a parent or granparent born in Scotland otherwise if you have any other Scottish people in your line they are your ancestors.<br>
<br>
Dwallyns post was not really directed at Tzuten <br>
<br>
(and yes Tz we did discuss your armour etc but I don't remember you saying your mum was Scottish, otherwise I would have prob offered to look into your Geneology for you! I aint saying shes not, just saying I don't remember been told)<br>
<br>
The post was directed at the person who presumed he was Scottish because he wore tartan and has a red beard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and was inspired by the fact that quite honestly every second American we speak to say's they are part Scottish (see above)<br>
<br>
I can understand why it it said and it occurs in America because of the nature and make-up of your country, a lot of people in America will have Scottish ancestors but they will also have English/Irish/Welsh (etc) ancestors, it therefore seems odd that almost every American I speak to is only ever part Scottish! (I said almost <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
I have Scottish ancestors and I am part Scottish are two different things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  both things to be proud of.<br>
<br>
You guys should all be proud to be American because your country has achieved so much, your ancestors came from different parts of the world sometimes from very difficult circumstances and despite all the hardships they made America what it is, where-ever they were from <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Its a well known fact thats a lot of Americans are in love with the romantic idea of Scotland, it is a beautiful country so why not <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

He looked Scottish so I asked, had nothing to do with the clothes btw, seeing as how I never really did research on Scottish attire (I'll make sure to put it on my to do list <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). As for all that other crap, (and I use the word crap because I didn't want to type out the long ass word it really was) I do sincerely hope Mr. Dwallyn NEVER comes to Canada, because here, we are considered to have a cultural mosaic, and everyone is very proud of the place they came from, or that their parents, or grandparents (or in my case go back to biblical times) came from. It's a fact of life, during the olympics... every single flag you could imagine flying on people's cars, garages, you name it. World cup... same deal. <br>
<br>
In the U.S. it is a lot less so, since they are a melting pot. I mean, in the U.S. I find that most people who have been there for more than 10 years, are pretty fluent with English, and are Americanized (is that a word?). When you come to Canada, you've got these people who have been here for longer than I've been alive, who still don't understand the word suticase, or beautiful. What's worse Dwallyn, they will all tell you they are &quot;Russian&quot; &quot;Japanese&quot; &quot;American&quot; (my mom never stops telling me that, and how I am half American...) We don't even take the time to say that it is merely our heritage. Although I do not say I am American, Polish, German, Israeli, Romanian, although there is a little bit of each in me technically, it is only because it is too extensive. I say <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I am Canadian</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
Now I have rambled far too long. but this is my opinion on the deal. I think Dwallyn is wrong, I think he went about this in a bad way, and I sincerely hope he was drunk, or on crack, or something, because I used to think he was a really nice guy. <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif"</img> <br>

<br>
I am just interested btw lol cos to be honest Scottish guys look the same as guys from all over the world. White/Black/Brown/yellow skin -  blonde/brown/black/red hair etc etc<br>
<br>
I thought it would have been the tartan or is it that you think he looks like a stereotypical Scot? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Btw this aint a flame or criticism just me been interested<br>
<br>
Oh and Dwallyn is nice hes just got opinions :P some people don't agree with em but they are there all the same.<br>
<br>
I understand what you mean about saying you are Canadian, maybe if you spoke to a Polish guy you may say you had a Polish ancestor and I guess thats really what Dwallyn was asking, why do people claim to be PART Scottish (ie parent or grandparent is Scottish) when really they have Scottish Ancestors. Its not just one or two people its a LOT and I guess could be to doe with how over the years ancestory and heritage has been viewed i.e In America if you have an Ancestor thats Scottish it may be the &quot;norm&quot; to say you are part Scottish, while over here its a different thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The rub is when some people *think* they might be better because they either 1/ look different or 2/ from a certain part of the world someone else is not. <br>
<br>
America has the unique ability to be a melting pot for people from all over the world - sort of cool actually. But people from Japan do look different than people from Nepal as an example, the thing is, that is good thing, not a bad. Makes people unique and special. So some people should get off thier 'holier than thou' attitudes, cus not to be crude, but you squat to @#%$ like everyone else.<br>

This is an argument over semantics.  In America, saying you are of Scottish heritage and saying you are part Scottish is pretty much the same thing.
