Actually this isn't exactly a flame. It is more to rais a question that I feel needs to be adressed if not just for my sake, for all of you. ShowEQ.<br>
<br>
I have not been playing this game for very long, and to be honest with you I did not think I would enjoy it when I first started playing. After coming from nearly 3 years of religiously playing Counter-Strike, the idea of a game where i HEARD it was impossible to cheat in REALLY interested me, as CS was a hackers heaven. After playing the game for a while I loved it. You know, community, fun blah blah. But the other day I came across someone using ShowEQ.<br>
<br>
I do not know much about ShowEQ other than the fact that it allows you to see what mobs are carrying what loot. This is blatantly cheating in my opinion. If you have 5 groups in a zone pulling, and one is using ShowEQ... who has the advantage? Weak.<br>
<br>
Doing a /guildstatus on the person, she was a member of one of the more minor guilds on the server. Which leads me to ask this question of anyone that might read this. If using ShowEQ and being a member of a minor guild on the server merely means nothing more than she sucks at EQ and feels the need to essentially cheat to help get ahead in the game, or if it means something more. If a member of a minor guild is using it... what about all of the so-called &quot;uber&quot; guilds on the server that always get the good drops? Do THEY use it?<br>
<br>
I am not here to accuse anyone of anything, I am just hear to get some information. Being as how the supposed impossibility to cheat is what made me enjoy the game so much to begin with, coming across this issue finally has lead me to think that not all are what they seem to be. This would horribly suck for me and make me change my entire attitude about the game I have enjoyed playing for the 9months I have been. This is a good game and I would really hate to see it turn lame because of these things. Granted, you have issues like this in any game or community, but you know.<br>
<br>
PLEASE tell me if my thinking is incorrect because i would really love to hear that. I hope people don't use ShowEQ to get ahead and try to keep this game fair and fun. <p>Mantik Miyagi<BR>

<br>
I see you're a level 58 monk.  Where have you been?  Not playing on the Rathe, obviously, because your scenario would never work. <br>
<br>
Groups go into a zone and establish a camp.  Other groups respect that camp, as they would want folks to respect theirs.<br>
<br>
In a zone with established camps, having ShowEQ and knowing that mob x has item y does not entitle you to that mob.<br>
<br>
Hmmm . . . could this be a bad case of Ebay?<br>

Because:<br>
<br>
It will NOT show you what a mob is carrying unless they can wield the item and are a biped in the first place. (you won't see Nagafen with a dagger sticking out of his ass, well not unless a rogue stuck it there)<br>
<br>
You will see A Final Arbiter wielding a primal spear, you won't see him toting around a bow or 2h weapon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I've not used it myself, but I have read a lot about what it can and cannot do.<br>
<br>
It will show you the stats of the mob you are fighting: exp it gives/hp/level/etc<br>
<br>
It can also give you a nice GUI esp if you're using EQW (eq in a window) with a mini-map of the zone that has little dots representing everything in the zone. Likely color-coded. I don't know if they've added mouse-overs to it yet, might be neat. Hmm.<br>

<br>
Your in Umbral plains pulling Elysians for drops. Now you can't camp the entire elysians so if you have two groups pulling from them and one is using showeq, who gets the mobs with elysian gear, and who doesn't? That explain it a little better?<br>

Show EQ is a packet sniffer and decoder, nothing more.<br>
<br>
Think of ShowEQ as super tracking on 'roids.  It has a minor impact on the PvE game, but is lethal on the pvp servers.<br>
<br>
It's use is more prevalent then people think, and I am sure that most people know someone who uses it.<br>
<br>
 It still takes a fair bit of resources and knowlege to use. (a seprate PC running Linux that is between the network source and your EQ box.) It's a cheat for sure, but not that big a deal for the most part. <p>Jurrasic Epoch <BR>

&quot;You must be ebayed&quot; now ranks right up there with &quot;MY dad can beat up your dad&quot;.  I guess if you dont use show EQ now and know everything about it you must be ebayed. <br>
<br>
O yea funny thing about &quot;ebayed&quot; characters, there exist one in almost every guild. Hell I know TONS of characters that were bought in the same guild because player A decided to leave and sell account so someone in guild buys just to keep that class active and in guild. <br>
<br>
How many people 2 box in this game.... TONS and im bettin a lot of those 2ndary characters were either bought or given away by someone leaving the game. <br>
<br>
SO for once how about we leave the &quot;ebayed&quot; comment, and @#%$ it, lets also leave the &quot;what are you 8 years old&quot; comment out of a post and see what happens.

I'm sure there is a web site out there that describes what this thing you are talking about does and does not do.

Strong and passionate, I tend to be misunderstood, sometimes even feared. I don't want to fight, I don't want to cause trouble, all I ask is a little love, and a little peace. If I don't get what I want, I get angry, and throw barrels and flaming oil at whatever's stopping me.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uevilrulz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evilrulz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/12/02 7:53:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=684.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: err</span><hr size=1> Actually gromm ill be turning 8 in just a couple months.

Anyway, just thought I would rant about the huge expectations some of you folks have.<br>

Not that I like posts being locked, but it sure would piss me off to volunteer free time to have some slackass whiner take a potshot any time I post. (The original poster had fair ground to zing her, imo.)<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Where have you been? Not playing on the Rathe, obviously, because your scenario would never work. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Are you all out of your minds? <br>
<br>
Regardless of your personal ideas about Nyca, you'd all have to be collectively on some strong medication to go from a comment which *obviously* indicates a person's ignorance or dismissal about our server's mechanics. <br>
<br>
Premise: Rathe camps are generally respected<br>
Premise: Good loot generally drops off named mobs in those respected camps<br>
Premise: Someone familliar with the rathe conventions would understand that ShowEQ may let you see what is about to drop, but let you do *sweet d!ck all* to get it, if it's already camped. <br>
Conclusion: Only someone without basic knowledge of the rathe server conventions would be worried about show EQ. <br>
<br>
If your willingness to find a way to attack Nyca extends to such apparent stretches of meaning as in this case, by all means, continue. But make sure you know you're being willfully blind about the actual intent of the statement.<br>
<br>
And guys, not that you're not entitled to be wrong or anything, take this as constructively as you can; Just 'cause you don't agree with her, doesn't make her the antichrist. <br>
<br>
S'yeah, try not reading meanings that allow you to break out the 'I wanna make fun of Nyca' bats, kk?<br>
