Nothing in Raifin's post supports your argument that &quot;Courtesy stops when it gets in NB's way&quot;.  Maybe thats true for FK, but not for NB.  NB tries very hard to extend the same courtesy that we would like to be shown, even when it does slow us down.<br>

So what he basically is saying is that it is all right for NB to do things like zone into ssra and run up to the &quot;prison&quot; room between XTC and HP? Blood?

Wrong, this thread is about FK and NB, not about Greyhaven, who are the “Ever Revered and Most Benevolent Guild in EQ”.  Of course, they spend their holiday time handing out good midrange items and buffs to low level players across Norrath during the holidays, not KSing mobs because they can’t read.  And no, I won’t watch you pull slurs out of your ass and throw them NB’s way.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> First off i wasnt there, but evertying ive read and been told about the TL incident says it occured this way.

While attempting to leave the group of FK were jumped by a TM and killed it. I believe it was Gromm that said something about mem blur, but I dont' have a clue wether a chanter was among the FK there or not.<br>
Now, after the death of the first mob to start the G/E/C cycle the guild has 1 hour to kill all the rest. It takes at most 20-30 mins to kill all trigger mobs. So if we were really trying to stall that time, why would we kill the first TM when TL was ALREADY in the basement?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Kapen already covered this, but since your lack of reading comprehension is so persistent, I will reiterate.  Tindi wasn’t in the basement, and FK intentionally killed just the Warden so that, as Desseray put it to Kapen: “FK wanted to try G/E”.  An obvious cockblock, and an important one, as it completely rejects your “propaganda” as false.  There was not just a single occurrence that I pointed to, but several.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> This is exactly the kind of propaganda i was asking the readers of the RTA to look thro before judging the actions of FK.

<br>
I didn’t post propaganda, I posted facts, personal experiences, and Kapen offered his.  Argue facts, or STFU.  Just saying “that’s propaganda” is not a valid argument or contradiction of the basic facts.  FK killed a TM to stall Tindi.  Fact.  FK did the same to NB.  Fact.  They lied about it in RTA channel, Fact.<br>

<br>
No, YOU misread.  I am telling YOU, someone who is clueless about what is going on here, that FK had *never* asked, either the day of, or one day, or several days in advance about trying a mob until Fere asked me about AL, AFTER this thread started.  This is my experience as a guild leader of a guild who would have received said tells, the same tells you would not have.  FK leadership didn’t ask on CT, XTC, Cursed, and certainly never sent any tells about the KT situation.  I also never said to ask “days” in advance.  I said the day before, as opposed to the night of.  Days ahead would be fine, but I didn’t insist on that as a preference.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> And im sure this is the biggest mistake you've ever made right Karadin<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In regards to actions involving other guilds, as a leader of NB, yes, this is the biggest mistake I’ve ever made.  Internally within NB, no, I have made greater mistakes.  As a player of EQ, again, I have made far greater mistakes.  As a person in life, I have made greater still, but none of those have nothing to do with this situation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> FK never asks for shots at mobs under any circumstances. OMG, that's 2 mistakes in one post...wonder how the universe is going to deal with this? Think it jstu might give up and end?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I was very clear, FK has never asked NB (prior to Fere’s AL question 2 days ago, AFTER this thread started), about a mob attempt under any circumstance.  And what that has to do with “What I am *not* capable of is misreading a simple post about FFA rules that say “check with the guild on rotation before killing any FFA mobs during the holidays)” is beyond me.  Not only is your reading comprehension lacking, but your relevant posting skills are having problems.  So no, the error count at the moment is Karadin 1, Halima 6.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Yup, this is very much a NB tactic. You are more than happy to sit and wait in the next room over and lag out a guilds attempt at a mob. Top notch!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, we didn’t sit and wait in the other room.  No one on our server fights XTC’s guards in the jail to keep them from repopping during the fight.  When we zoned in, we asked where you were, you said XTC, and we figured you would be done by the time we cleared up to Jail for HP.  We ran into a room we expected to see no one in, and found a small group of 8-10 FK, and would have backed out immediately, except that Sylph and Fere said their healers went LD.  To minimize the accidental impact we had, we healed your tanks till their healers got back and we moved back to the platform.  We then helped CR your wipeout which you blame us for, despite our never coming close to your main raid force.  At no time did FK request we wait elsewhere, nor tell us they were in the jail.  Halima 7.  The error being “very much an NB tactic” and “waiting in the next room over to lag out a guild”.  If that were our goal and tactic, why aren’t we following you guys around more at AoW, your recent G/E victory, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I agree completely, and I think FK does too.

You *are* accusing us of intentionally sabotaging your XTC raid.  That is what that whole “tactic” bit applies to.  And as for what Raifin says, it has nothing to do with NB, since he doesn’t speak for NB, I do.  That’s his personal opinion, and has nothing to do with our argument.  Hell, if you’d care to notice, his opinion is directly opposite mine, I said ask the day before, and he said the night of the raid.  Is that Halima 10 or 11 now?<br>

My earlier post made three typos, one with the formatting of a quote that doesn't seem to bother the meaning, but two below that do.<br>
<br>
1)  As a person in life, I have made greater still, but none of those have nothing to do with this situation.<br>

You haven't been a part of this community at all, just a blind sheep following the herd. Fact of the matter is.. you weren't there.. I wasn't there.. neither of us knows what happened.. the issue happened once with TL (re: Kapen's response) and then a second time with NB. Now, how many times does something &quot;bad&quot; have to happen for you to get the picture?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
So if Karadin is a nice guy in game he isn't a good GL? Nice education you have there kiddo. You are probably more stupid for going to school than not. Learn to think for yourself sometime, then, in the future, you won't need to try and defend yourself by claiming a vaulted education since people might actually infer you have one or are at least intelligent.<br>

If I didn't know any better I'd have to say you were either: a) a different person than the original owner of that character.  b) corrupted in some way.  c) I perceived you as someone you aren't. d) the rathe needs another server split. e) all of the above. or f) none of the above.<br>
<br>
Making comments regarding IQ won't win you any awards, neither will claiming you have an education because a peice of paper says you do. *laugh*<br>

In any case, grats on the G/E kill to FK.. cursed is only a baby step away.<br>

Who knows why you are pulling mobs into the jail to fight XTC. Sounds like a recipe for a wipeout to me.<br>

NB should have had no reason to expect that being in the Jail would disturb you in any way whatsoever.<br>

<br>
Damn, I didn't want it like this though, I wanted everyone involved, this is just like two groups it sucks.<br>
<br>
I actually have to admit that all the long posts seem intelligent. From everyone even Karadin whom I try so hard to irritate but he never bites but he's the only one I can think of that hasn't so he gets a trophy.<br>
<br>
I want to take a moment before I log on to EQ, to write a long post of my own. This is a post to anyone who wants to read it, and it contains some information, part of which may or may not be useful to individuals visiting the FC boards now, or at some future date.<br>
<br>
It is quite simple for someone such as myself to ramble on and on for what may seem like an eternity simply to demonstrate my ability to post very long and boring posts.<br>
<br>
Here in FC, most of us pride ourselves on hitting hard where it counts, or in using trickery to draw the enemy to our side and when they least expect it, knock them on their ass. It's common knowledge, but I feel the need to inform those who may be ignorant to flames and flaming.<br>
<br>
I also want to take a moment to say that I am really trying to get a feel here for what it's like to be Karadin, and write a novel at least once a day for a week knowing that the only gratification I will get from it will be when the next person posts and I have an opportunity to atempt slamming them again. <br>
<br>
Karadin, you are not the only offending novel writer, however you have the most novels so it seems fitting to bitch about it using you as an example. If you read this and you feel as if I should have used someone else as an example, please contact me in game or on email (I believe me email is plastered in multiple places here) and let me know maybe how you feel as well as any suggestions as to whom you would like to see used as the afore mentioned example.<br>
<br>
This is not nearly as long as Karadin's posts, because I am not including any quotes from previous posts, because frankly I don't give a shit about the whole thing because I wasn't really involved in any way shape or form other than I was actually about to go kill the thing with FK but didn't know about this stuff, but even if I did I wouldn't care because I play to have fun, not to stress about guild rotations and other stupid shit like that.<br>
<br>
So, Karadin to you sir, I would like to extend an opportunity to click the community chest link for the RTA and donate some money. Because I think that this week you have used up more bandwidth than Kagato, Drache, Me, and Nycah all combined.<br>
<br>
If you don't want to donate, then well, that is your choice, that's why it's called a dontation however, I personally will not see you as the Massiah anymore if you don't because to me you will be just a crook, showing the true colors of you and your shit stain buddies. At this point I feel like I can say anything I want to you, because well, you aren't even going to read this far.<br>
<br>
So, ic closing I would like to just say that everyone needs to STFU and start talking about FFA. Need you FFA supporters to step up to the keyboard, come on guys I know you are out there, this thread could own but it will suck if noone is opposing the lemmings except me. Anyways, gonna log on see you all later have a fun weekend, even you Karadin. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
As for the jail incident, none of us wanted that to happen.  If we had thought anyone would pull mobs out of XTC room into the jail while fighting XTC, we would certainly not have rushed into the room like we did.  <br>
<br>
The jail room is on the way to High Priest.  We usually make it a staging poing on our lemming-like runs to our kill area.  Imagine our surprise when we rush into a usually empty room to find it full of mobs.  Most folks didn't even think that this would be FK.  For all we knew, one of our own idiots aggroed mobs and drug them into the room.  Immediately Karadin and others begin shouting to get out and for the clerics to start healing the FK guys that are tank-mezzing the mob.<br>
<br>
I really don't think this had anything to do with your wipeout.  In fact, I'd be willing to bet money on it, but at any rate there was no malice or intent in what happened.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a> <b>9</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=201&stop=208>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=981.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=981.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=180><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=981.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=981.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> -
