Each of them has invested a lot of time and effort to work on their epic.  They've been ready and waiting longer than the other clerics on the list.

In fact, there were about 5 or 6 clerics in line ahead of Apex clerics when all our clerics were ready. There were a couple Triad, a couple Tiarcs (3 maybe?) and one or two nonguilded or clerics from smaller guilds on that list. Rather than insist on a rotation, and in an effort to see the other guilds get a few sprinklers in, Apex agreed to have ALL six of our clerics added to the END of this list.<br>
<br>
The most comical thing about this, is when we were added to the end, it was mentioned by someone in /gu...&quot;you wait, as soon as our turn comes around, some people are going to start bitching that we have so many clerics in a row in spite of the fact that we waited our turn and didnt insist on a rotation.&quot;  They were right. Once again, we do something nice for the server, and get targeted for it. <br>

<br>
Krillian, were you insinuating I would not be good enough to be hanging out where you are to give you a res?  Never know when tragedy will strike, but you still would get some loving from the limpstick resser.<br>
<br>
Now, onto the list....yet again.<br>
<br>
People, please please please read the post that I keep the list in.  Notice that the date changes each time A cleric gets Rage.  I do not leave up the previous people on the list.  <br>
<br>
Krillian, this list was NEVER EVER set up by guild.  My putting up the guild name with the person's name was a mistake on my part. I did it merely to keep up with the list and where I could find people when I had a question for them.  Sometimes they are on an alternate so I would do /who all heroes (for example) and ask a person at random if so and so is on in any form.  So, putting guild names up for the public was a bad idea.<br>
<br>
You folks will have to trust me when I say in no way did I devise a list that would in anyway be unfair to an individual, guilds I could care less about.  The people are my concern.  And I will repeat this for the umpteenth time: YOu can leave a guild but never leave yourself.  Meaning that epic belongs to a person, it is not guild property, ever!  It is NO DROP.  Hell I am not even in the same guild that I got mine with, in any of its new forms.<br>
<br>
Tiarcs, Triad, Hyakka, and Legacy of the Chosen were part of the beginings of this list.  We alternated a few people since we were all ready at one time.  When Apex had thier mass Ixiblat salying ang had 6 folks ready there was NO ONE else on the list or ready.  I saw no need in making those people wait until more folks got ready so I could mix them in.  I have said all along it is first come first serve on the list.  I do not care if you are guilded, unguilded, or whatever, you get on the list the same.<br>
<br>
Yes, the chaos I read about from other servers is what I wanted to save Luclin's clerics from.  We had a nasty KS attempt early on that led to this list.  The attempting guild has redeemed themselves and there are no hard feelings.  But I would hate to see that happen all the time.  It is a pain to get to the point of Ragefire and seeing ANYONE start over due to a botched attempt of a KS would make me sick.<br>
<br>
The original post has been edited many many times as the list formed into what I designed it to be, and to me it is working fine.  It really goes faster than you guys think it does.  We got 4 clerics done in one week when there was not so many dang patches.  <br>
<br>
Hang in their friends.  Trust me on this one.  Ole Faye don't wanna hinder no person from getting thier cleric epic. <br>

<br>
I thought guild rotation happened when one guild went then next went and so on then went back to the first guild like was posted on the very first post on the list thread, not the one changed to keep current...wish i knew how to go back but anyway its something like tiarcs will go then legacy of chosen then apex then back to tiarcs something like that was the wording, sorry my bad its not a rotation.<br>
<br>
and since its not a rotation and is just put together as people sign up i think that it is real funny that apex asked to be put at the bottom and someone predicted people would have a problem when they all came up and it came true. BTW if people are being added to the list in the order they are asking wouldnt that have put all those clerics at the end without them asking? did they have some choice to move up or something...<br>
<br>
Now I am done tease jibe get off subject by saying I think I am better than so-n-so or whatever you like. I had read the very first post many times over and everytime I came up with it was guild rotation with individuals added if they didnt have a guild.<br>

But, I agree with Torlack.  Sometimes there is just nothing to read between the lines on.  No hidden agenda, no conspiracy, and no scandal.  If anyone has a question about what the real purpose and goal of this list is I will sum it up for you yet again:  To get as many clerics thier epics as possible and to get them as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
You know, one side effect of this new deal is that Nagafen is getting killed at record paces.  He no longer gets to be up for 7, 10 14 days. About 24 hours and boom he is dead.  So we are getting our 52 and under community a lot of Dragon exp and raid fun.<br>
<br>
See, it works out for all.  Thanks Luclin for all your support. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Fayenae <BR>

<br>
&quot;Nagafen dies-guild A gets the first pop of Ragefire afterwards, they kill Ragefire and then send a tell to the next cleric/guild in line, and so on and so on. We do it in a way that gets Luclin the most Ragefire spawns in between Nagafens. This is done till Naggy pops again and we start over.&quot;<br>
<br>
ROFL.. ok ,, she didnt edit it.. look its a GUILD rotation<br>
<br>
&quot;Currently the list looks like this: Tiarcs, Triad, LotC, Apex and back around to Tiarcs.&quot;<br>
NOWHERE is the names of individual clerics.. it goes by GUILD.  period , this is how it was setup, and for some reason (i think we all know why) it has changed now.<br>
<br>
all you can do is sit here and get shafted cuz if you try to take your turn ppl gonna call you KSer or what not... this is really alot of BS<br>

The text you are referring to is actually the VERY FIRST post in the rotation thread.  There hasn't been an attempt to cover anything up.<br>
<br>
If you look on the second page, second message, you see that Fay added all of Apex to the end because no other guilds had posted that they were ready. <p>Torlack Stumptoe<br>Captain of the House of Endorean<br>Member of the House of Faith<br>Loyal to the House of Vishnu<br>APEX

They chose to alternate between themselves.  It would make sense that any who came after would be added to the bottom of the list since they were not ready when the list was created.  Apex came along AFTER the list had already been created. When the Apex clerics came along ONLY our clerics were ready, no one else was ready and that is why they were added one after another.  /bonk  How hard is that for you to understand? <p>Aeriana Alcielo<BR>
