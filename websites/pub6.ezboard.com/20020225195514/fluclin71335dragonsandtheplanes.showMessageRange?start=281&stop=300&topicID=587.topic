If you want to look for flames in this thread, then you might begin with your own comments.  I do not like to read flame threads; they hold no interest for me.  This thread is the only one of interest to me because of the profound impact it has on the accomplishment of my epic quest.<br>
<br>
In case you didn't know (and I am sure you don't until you read my following comments), the first &quot;grandfather&quot; clauses were instituted by seven southern states to prevent African Americans from voting.  I do not agree with their grandfather clauses, nor do I agree with this one.  I believe grandfather clauses are a tragedy to our societal evolution (a different topic I could lecture on).  However, I can see that this is not about helping those with a legitimate right to finishing their epic quest, but, rather, a ploy to maintain and exercise authority over others.  In light of that, I will agree to disagree with you.<br>
<br>
My apologies to all that have to endure reading through this.  If a &quot;flame&quot; is deserved, then please direct it at Fayenae, self-imposed dictator of the Luclin cleric epic quest, in another thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulerwinthemighty.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lerwin The Mighty</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=69071048&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnome Obsessed</span><br>  Posts: 732<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 5:48:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Ragefire spawns:  reservation/rotation list</span><hr size=1> this guy is so trying to start a fire <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Whatever the origin of the term may have been is utterly meaningless, and trying to throw in race is utterly despicable. <br>
<br>
Let's say a small town is beginning to attract a lot of big chain-store businesses, driving out the mom-and-pop shops. The town doesn't like it and so they rezone all of downtown so that new businesses above a certain size and scope are not allowed. &quot;What about this huge Sears store that was built last year?&quot;, a Home Depot executive whines. Well, it would not only be unethical to force that store to close, it would probably be illegal, they did what was perfectly ok according to law when they built their store, it can only affect future businesses moving in. That Sears store was &quot;grandfathered&quot; in. (this was a real life example taken from my hometown, which has grown increasingly paranoid about big businesses destroying the &quot;feel&quot; of downtown.)<br>
<br>
Let's take it a bit further, and be a little rediculous. Lets say in some other state or country or whatever, a few people are trespassing on someone's land, and by the suspicious actions of these people and by their conversation, the owner of the land is afraid for his safety, and so he shoots them all. After its found out no harm was intended from them, theres an outcry to throw the land owner in jail. However, apparently there is a little-known law in this mythical place saying that if someone is trespassing and your afraid for your life, then you may shoot them. A stupid law, the public cries out, lets get rid of it! So, law is done away with, and then the people say &quot;now that the law which used to allow this guy's action is gone, lets go throw him in jail!&quot; <br>
<br>
In the US at least, this sort of thing is prohibited by law and court precedents. Whatever the law says at the time is what you can be tried for, any new laws passed outlawing that action only affects things from that point on, assuming that previous action isnt continued.<br>
<br>
What in the world does this have to do with everquest? Well, a long time ago, about a year and a half or so ago, they changed the naming policy a bit, to affect all future names. What about the players who had names which used to be legal, but now because of some brand-new technicality is now illegal? They &quot;grandfathered&quot; them in, if you were given a name by a GM before the change long ago, and the policy change now made that name illegal, you could keep your name, just no one else could get a similar one now that everyone knows about it.<br>
<br>
Similarly, you are now apparently proposing we punish people for doing what was perfectly ok at the time by dropping them right now. That would not be ethical, I'm sorry you dont see it that way.<br>
<br>
If all you want is a time limit, well then stop whining, because they have one. Not a uniform one, those at the top have a much shorter deadline than those at the back, but its a solid deadline for each person. You reach the top without the pearl, and your gone untill you get one, when you can rejoin again, but this time at the bottom. <p>Cayleu Starshine

Honestly, what kind of authority does she have?<br>
<br>
There are two basic kinds of authority, there's the real unmovable type of authority, where one person has authority over another, period. Your boss decides whether or not you still have a job tomorrow. A prison guard has authority to do what he can to prevent prisoners from leaving.<br>
<br>
Then, you have &quot;given&quot; authority. A government is only as powerful as its citizens decide to allow it. What we have here is basically a list that is permitted, not forced on us, by widely-supported consent. A couple people here and there may disagree, but the list lives because the vast majority of people support it, and there's not enough opposition to destroy it. <br>
<br>
So, if we will have this list, then someone has to be in charge. When a hairy situation comes up and some judgement call needs to be made, one person is more effective than some indecisive sluggish committee. Preferrably someone as selfless, nice, and FAIR as Fayenae. We arent talking about prison guards VS prisoners here, this is a bunch of people who agreed to a few ideals, and needs someone to run the boring everyday details and decisions about it. If Fayenae ever did become some power-mad tirant (HA!), then the server wouldnt put up with it.<br>
<br>
For the last 4 months, and today, the list is in place because of near-universal consent. Poor Fayenae must have done something horrible, because she was punished savagely with the responsibility of getting the stupid headaches that dealing with people involve.<br>
<br>
Now, I think I've said way more than an anon poster deserves, so I think I'll stop. <p>Cayleu Starshine

I was doing my updates with folks about whether or not they have a pearl and I ran across a lvl 43 on the list. Not only does he not have a pearl but he is to low to even do the quest.  I removed him.  He in no was was protected under the grandfather rules, and he was not removed for not having a pearl.  He was removed for being to low to even do the quest.  It was never written out by me that you had to be 50+, but part or the core of the quest is you have to be 50+.  This is by the game makers design.  <br>
<br>
I removed a person who could not even do the quest. Granted, he could be 50 by the time he comes up, but we are dealing with principle here.  I told him, and this is true, I have turned away many clerics who wanted to go ahead and get on the list at 40, 42 and 48. Those are the actual levels of folks who asked.  Of all the pearl checks I have done this was the first time I saw this person and the were not anon.<br>
<br>
So let me know what you think.  Like I said I did not remove for him not having a pearl.  I removed because he was to low to even do the quest.<br>

You have stated all are grandfathered in and no one will be removed unless they get to the front and do not have the pearl. That seems pretty plain and simple.<br>
<br>
It does not seem very fair to suddenly remove one individual. (This would be where anon poster screams abuse of power) I brought up the deadline because it would apply to all of the list people equally and would give everyone fair warning that they better get the pearl by X date or be removed. To just single one out when they could very well be fifty by the time they are up seems very wrong. Infact why is it any different to wait to get your note for 3 months than to lvl in that same period. We all know the the note can be done before then and nothing else is really a all that big of a challenge.<br>
<br>
I think I would be very upset if I was the cleric in question after reading all the post here. Nothing in them suggest a lvl, they told they are grandfathered in, there is no deadline. Please add them back to the list unless you chose to make everyone responsible for the pearl by a certain date. It is the ONLY right thing to do.<br>

A basic requirement to get and remain on the Ragefire rotation list for the epic quest, should probably be that you are able to do the epic quest. Someone who doesnt have the pearl yet but is over 50th level is still able to do the quest, and it is *they* who are grandfathered in, avoiding the pearl requirement. (Untill they are at the top at least, when they will be kicked off without the pearl)<br>
<br>
If you are under 50th level, then you are not capable of doing the epic quest, and shouldnt be on the list. It's just common sence, and really is as simple as that. <p>Cayleu Starshine

The rules did not say you could not get on the list therefore it is not fair to remove this one person.<br>
<br>
It is not that far from 43 to 50. They are not up for rage anytime soon that I can tell since I know most of the clerics in front of me. So they have a reasonable amount of time to get their pearl and be ready. I say again what is difference in them taking 3 months to lvl as opposed to someone taking 3 months to get the note?<br>
<br>
The only way and I mean the only way I could maybe stomache it would be if they have not started the quest at all. Even then under the rules that were in place it would bite to remove them. Does the person have the Crown, the note, the ring? Have they done any part of the epic? If they have started their quest then they should stay on the list. <br>
<br>
If you want to be fair and tell everyone they need to get the pearl by a certain time (currently that time is when they are up for Rage) then removing those that dont make it would not be unreasonable at all, but no where in this thread is a lvl mentioned to be put on the list that I can find.<br>
<br>
I hope these post are not coming off like I am upset because I am not. I do not think anyone should have signed up before they could do the quest, but that is not the point at all. It was allowed just like being on without a pearl was allowed. The pearl rule ensures this will not happen again. So if a deadline is not something that we are gonna do then put the cleric back on and live with it. To do otherwise is wrong in the worse way.<br>

<br>
Also, I believe that, on principle, since a cleric under 50th is not capable of doing the quest, then they have no business being on the list. That's just my two pennies. <p>Cayleu Starshine

I do a back ground check on every person on this list.  It was not until last night that I saw the cleric in question was 43.  If I had known that at the time of him signing up he would have never been put on to tart with.  If there is anyone else who is under 50 on this list they will be removed as well.<br>
<br>
This was not a question of he got on without the pearl, it was the fact he slid by undetected and now got caught.  Like I said had nothing to with the pearl, grandfathering in, or anything of that nature.  It all comes down to the dact he was too low to do the quest and therefore should not be put on the list at all in the first place.<br>
<br>
Read my post again, I have rejected people under 40 in the past, and I will continue to do so. This quest is for 50+.<br>

 <br>
I am sorry once again for any trouble I may have made here. Not to smart of me sense I am on this list and none of this really effects me. In my job I have to correct problems before they happen, I thought with some corrective measures to get a P by everyones name in a reasonable amount of time we could head off any trouble down the line as the pressure builds on the model that other servers should be using.<br>
