<br>
I will make the groups after gathering the attendance (and will try to &quot;pre-make&quot; as many groups as I can). We usually make 7 or 8 groups, so here's how they will go.<br>
<br>
Groups 1-4: Melee groups, with 4 tanks and 2 healers<br>
Group 5-7: Caster Nuker Groups<br>
Group 8: Whatever else is needed<br>
<br>
Upon grouping, I want to start moving groups into Permafrost through the hidden entrance approximately 45 minutes to 60 minutes AFTER the raid is set to start. When the first group moves in, the raid list will be cut off. No one else will be able to join UNLESS we need your class - for this raid that is bards, enchanters and clerics ONLY. These are three classes that we typically run short on. <br>
<br>
We will move the groups in by &quot;bounding overwatch,&quot; i.e. 1 group moves to 1 way point, then the next, and groups start leapfrogging from one staging point to the next. 2 groups at a time will clear the area up to the next staging point. Staging points will be the Entrance, the Flag room, the King Room. Once the king room is cleared, we will stage all groups to that area. When all groups are moved to that area, we'll have our casters bind and buff up for the ice giants. 3-4 groups will move up to take down the first set of ice giant spawns. The other groups will then move to this point and take the next staging point, the goblin champion/gate area. At that point, feign death pullers (if we have them) will begin to pull from the hallways leading to Vox's lair. The goal will be to clear the hallway room in 1 or 2 split pulls, then start trying to pull the ice giants from Vox's lair. We will lotto and epic quest items we gain BEFORE we pull from the lair. <br>
<br>
This could take quite a while, depending on the placement of the spawns (near Vox or not) and the capabilities of our FD puller. If we don't have an FD puller, we'll just have to deal with 3 ice giant spawns in the throne room. After the lair is clear, we will set up in the hallway below the ramp leading to Vox's lair. You must be careful in this area, and follow your group leaders. There are pit traps in this area that will cause your death AND quite possibly a train. If you die in the pits, it could be a long while until we can res you. I will instruct group leaders in the locations of the pit traps, listen to them. <br>
<br>
We will buff in the hallway outside Vox's Lair and down the ramp. Buffs will go as per Shoji's last post on the organization. We'll need one person with a second account to go outside and set up a chat room and keep it open at this point. I will have 1 group of tanks step out of the buff line and their job will be to pull any ice giants that spawn in the area while we are buffing. They will be the last to leave before the actual buffing line camps out. This group will be there to make sure we don't have spawns behind us when fighting Vox. If there is an ice giant that spawns anywhere from the front door of Vox's lair to the gate, it is their job to kill it before camping out. <br>
<br>
One buff that will be necessary is Dead Man Floating, to keep those who are feared from falling in the pits. <br>
<br>
Upon camping out and reaching the chat room, I'll answer any questions about the strategy. When the word is given by the final buffer, no one is to leave the chat room and login until I say so. Keep your group leader's name in mind when you log out, as you'll need to find your group leader immediately upon entering. Group up and get ready. <br>
<br>
The healers of all groups will need to move to the ramp immediately and will be set up in the triage line spots, right outside the door to her lair, along both sides of the wall and down the ramp. All the warriors and paladins will then line up in the middle of the hall between the healers and get ready to charge. After them should be the monks, rangers and rogues. As the charge order is given, the battle commander will lead the warriors and paladins into the lair, attempting to pull the beast back to the back of her lair (away from the door). It is CRUCIAL that you pull the dragon AWAY from the door as far as possible before landing your first hit. The last 3 guilds to try and fail on Vox (GH, Ashborne and The Natural Order) all had problems with Vox being stuck in a wall. They were unable to hit her, but she tagged them. Once the last warrior/paladin is through the door, the monks, rangers and rogues rush in. When the last rogue has rushed in, the mages and necros will send in their pets (mages and necros are the only ones who use pets on this raid at any time). All casters will need to try to get Vox on target, and at 60-70% health, charge in and begin nuking her. One or two mages or shamans will be charged with the job of Malosi and will need to shout when it lands. You'll need to get within melee range to have a good chance of landing spells. All other nuking classes hit him with any magic based or preferably cold based damage spells you have. Do not use AOE spells. Enchanters, at 60-70% health, are to run in with the nuking casters and begin throwing Mana Sieve repeatedly on Vox. This is EXTREMELY important, for when Vox gets to 30% health, if she has enough mana will cast complete heal on herself, which means we will die. <br>
<br>
Tanks will need to hit and taunt for all they are worth. When you reach 50% health, run back to the triage line shouting &quot;Your Name Coming in for a Heal&quot; and when reaching the Triage line &quot;Your Name Here for a Heal.&quot; Your group's healer should heal you, and any other healers needed and get back in there. Taunt for all you are worth until Vox aggros on you, then back off. You'll know you got aggro when she claws you for about 150 points.  <br>
<br>
Druids of 49th level or above may be asked to nuke using Starfire, those below will heal. If we don't have enough healers, we'll charge the 49th and above with healing too.<br>
<br>
If an ice giant is spawned in the lair with Vox, one of the enchanters is to charm it and send it against Vox or other ice giants if needed. When the beast is down, ONLY the designated loot person is to loot the beast and each group leader will assign a group looter. <br>
<br>
Anyone complaining of boredom in public channels or complaints of other types will be warned. If repeated sarcasm continues, you could be banned. There will be some boring times on this raid, probably while we try to pull the ice giants out of Vox's Lair. Complaining in group chat of bordeom excessively can also get you disbanded. Don't do it, as it annoys people and contributes nothing to the raid. <br>
<br>
AT all times, you must listen to me, the raid commander and follow my orders. In the abscence of me, listen to your group leader. NO ONE is to call &quot;Camp&quot; or &quot;Evac&quot; but me or my backups. There may be times when we HAVE to camp out to clear aggro, but ONLY I am the person to call it. <br>
<br>
Any questions? <br>
