Not because he charges for rezzes. Not because he spends hours upon hours shouting his drivel. I started feeling disdain for this idiot upon learning he charged people in Oasis for HEALS! That is about as low as the shaman I grouped with once who wanted me to go pull and when I asked for SoW, he answered with, &quot;Donation please.&quot;  WTF is with people making helper classes and then charge for every drop of mana they use?  <br>
<br>
However, it was still just a slight dislike I had for K-Mart til I observed him in KC purposely pulling trains to the left, zoning out, then coming in shouting he was rezzing.  He drums up business by deliberately trying to get people killed. THAT IS PURE GOOD OLD FASHIONED BULL SHIT! <br>
<br>
I could think &quot;dumb fuckin asshole&quot; new to zone that can't comprehend the difference between the right and left sizes of zone out. In fact, that is what I thought the first time I saw him do it. But there has been more than one occasion. He ran in, went to the courtyards -with and without groups there - tagged mobs and ran back out where people were sitting.  And others have seen him do it, too. <br>
<br>
He has told us he doesn't care about his rep on that character. K-Mart was made to make money for his alts. Fine. Make money with a shaman by selling potions. Make a chanter and learn JC. But quit deliberatly killing others and making money off their misery.<br>
<br>
If I see this pimple on Norath's ass needing help, I will not hesitate... to ignore his lame ass. Too bad we can't still buff and heal mobs that are fighting cumsuckers like this!<br>
<br>
He is still guilded. I did a /guildstatus on him. Its amazing he is in a guild with some kind of name with &quot;honor&quot; in it. There is NO honor in deliberatly training others for any reason. <p><BR>

With my shammy and monk I've observed this person gouging the pure morale of ppl though....his spamming and then bragging about it, makes clerics in a bad light.  <br>
<br>
The reason I say ebay is that he bragged he was, and how he charges 50-100pp for anything.  I believe he came on with an alt druid, Lionbreath, in DL and started that same crap.  &quot;Porting to anywhere for 100pp&quot;.  Same manner of speech an all.....now I don't want to quote another thread like the famous page eight, but still it goes to show that he not only bragged about that he would do it, but did.  He buys the accounts, multi-boxes and charges this.  I think it's plain ignorant to do this.......do I charge for tossing sow's or chloro from my shammy...NO....but, yes, in retrospect I have to charge for the potions to offset the costs of the ingredients and fizzle factor.<br>
<br>
Mana, is just that.....mana, and is recovered.  If you want a good rep, there's things to do.  But all this proves is that he and the guild that he is afiliated with now are aware of the problem and do not care or wish to avoid the subject all together.  Granted they may have voiced opinion and warned him, but still it persists.<br>
<br>
Now as far as some goto lengths to say:  place this person on ignore or just stop going to zones.  This does nothing to help anyone else from thinking that all clerics are money grubbing whores.  As I've seen on many posts here talking about jasmanna or Deaksun, everyone has taken posts there and personally told ppl to stay away from these individuals or you'll get screwed.   Now I'm not saying he's going to steal items or is going to hack your account, but I'd like to warn ppl that read the boards that there is a bad apple, sorta speak, amoungst the other clerics.  yes, by all means make your own opinion and vouch the character of player he is.  Consider the following though if there is enough ppl here have met him and post opinions, what's that say for his character......<br>

<br>
They have some really nice folks in this guild. When I detaged from EotF I was asked to come over and help them with an alt of some nature from a good friend in that guild. <br>
Well when I found out Kamar was in this guild. I could not help but think of the days long ago when he was in rathe mountain camping that gypsie with the pet. <br>
I remember him killing something that argooed me and that kinda erked me So I sat there and let him KS me 2 more pops and took my Cleric and KSed him once in trun of his rudness. He petitoned me and what not. GM was like share the spawn, Well I did not want the spawn. I never wanted to kill the darn thing in the first place. I just happen to sit down for a sec and got argooed Kamar was no where to be found when that argoo happened. <br>
All I can say is Kamar and his repeated ooc's made me put him on my ignore list. Do not discreadit Armor and Honor who probably will never see these posts or know that RTA exsists. <br>
<br>
They have no clue about Kamars past and I detaged my little alt shortly after I found out he was in there.<br>

On my last server, &quot;Tholuxe Paells&quot;, this cleric (over 20 pages on the flame) charged his group members for rezzes after HIS group was wiped out.  That was the absolute LOWEST thing I have EVER seen a cleric do.  I hope we never see a stunt like this here.<br>
