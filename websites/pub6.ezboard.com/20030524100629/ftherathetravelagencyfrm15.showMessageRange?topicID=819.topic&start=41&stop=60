Roggulbuk, you had waaaay too much free time on your hands for that post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I do see your point on the people there in force .. atleast reguarding the other spawns.  On Vindi I guess I personally see it differently, because there are so many places to set up a 'raid camp' around the arena, that could be used to pull Vindi, or just have an Arena raid .. <br>
<br>
Quite often guilds do farm Kael with a massive amount of people.  <br>
<br>
SoY saw CoN there .. but they didn't know they were there for Vindi.  The claims to vindi appear to have been made before SoY arrived.  Before Ken was going to pull, he made everyone aware of shout or ooc, that he was going to be pulling.  <br>
<br>
At this time, it is said that some people from CoN send him tells to discuss it .. he was mistaken, he didn't know they were there for vindi, so he backed off .. they pulled too soon, they felt threatened by his force being there.  He let them have their shot, he did not make them pull early, he did not suggest they pull early .. it was a mistake made on their part.  <br>
<br>
His guild helped them CR, then he pulled Vindi .. Again, he let them have their shot once he found out they were there for Vindi, they wiped out, he helped them CR, and he killed Vindi.  There was no wrong doing here, he was fair about it ..<br>
<br>
Though, if I read right, Ken and Skyewolfe talked during the CR, and it sounds like Ken said okay for them to go at it for another shot -- This is the nice thing to do, but not required .. If he said he was going to do this, and then pulled and killed anyway.  Then as I said in my first reply, that is fucked up!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alistriwen>Alistriwen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>tba</span><br>  Posts: 632<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/5/02 6:17:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/Israelflag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The lies, The Lies....</span><hr size=1> Posted with permission of the guildy, who did not want to come to the RTA, but said I could post this.

Ok, so as you can see, we were still in the process of switching people around in groups to be ready. Ken yells he's pulling, so Sekhar the brave fool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  announces that he HAS to pull Vindi when he sees him.  Furthermore, Ken even yells he is taking Vindi after we said to him we had been claiming him for the past long while. Dispelling the whole &quot;backed down&quot; idea. Again, good luck SoY! <p>&lt;img align=top src=&quot;http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif&quot;&lt;/img&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br>

I did finally see someone call it when Kenshiiro /ooc'd we were pulling Vindi.  I know one of our clerics came to rez them.  Perhaps we should have killed Vindi for them and let them loot?  Pffft.  I am truly sorry there was a misunderstanding of some sort.  I am even sorrier that I waded through these illiterate posts from persons that weren't even present.

Sounds to me like Kenshiiro was NOT in the zone when the first camp check was done, and CoN told SoY they were doing vindi .. ONLY Left Arena was called as a camp by Sekhar, after Ken asked for a camp check.<br>
<br>
So, Raitlin &lt;-- blame him for not relaying the info to his guildleader Kenshiiro .. Vindi wasn't called when SoY's Guild leader/raid leaders were in the zone ..

As for where Vindi is fought, that has absolutely no bearing on anyone's argument. You could be fighting him at the zone, just because your guild doesn't do him there doesn't mean it's wrong.<br>
<br>
SoY, as a guild, has screwed up a few times.. but then again everyone makes mistakes. Let's just hope they learn from them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
CoN never did shout their camp.<br>
<br>
CoN got utterly stomped by Vindi.<br>
<br>
SoY took the opportunity that was opened to them by CoN's utter failure and killed Vindi.<br>
<br>
There was nothing dirty about the kill, nothing dirty about SoY moving into an unclaimed camp, waiting while the unspoken campers got totally trashed, and then killing the Vindi when it was quite theirs.<br>
<br>
People got pissed when nobody should have.  It was a legit move.  Next time, maybe CoN will do better.  Next time, maybe SoY will fail and CoN will take the kill.  It'll be perfectly legit then too.<br>

SoY did nothing wrong and is deserving of the contempt of none of you. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; <br>

If I were a guild/raid leader and a member deliberately did not tell me something like this, I would remove them from the guild.  This is just not how guilds work.  Members spout off who is already at their intended mob.  It would be beyond devious not to.  And, regardless, a member is a representative of their guild.  Period.  End of story.

There is a missing hour there that if possible would be nice to see.  When your amassing for a mob of Vindi proportion and you see another guild coming in force it is quite common to /who  and see who is the zone.<br>
<br>
When CoN saw SoY coming into the zone for OVER an hour..amassing....wasnt anything said in /OOC or /Tells to ensure there was no mistakes?<br>
<br>
I would just like a little clarification there if possible.  <br>
<br>
On a last note I was told before that CoN does the Arena with up to 5 groups to farm armor, there is nothing wrong with that but I was just wondering if you normally do Kael with 5 groups and then not attempt Vindi?  <p><center><BR><font color= Blue><BR><i>Granitfist/Jeribu<i/><BR><i>GrandMaster/High Priest<i/><BR><i>Co-Leader of Circles End<i/><BR><i>The Rathe<BR><center><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370733">The Monk </> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370756">The Cleric<i/>

We do not require, nor do we assemble 5 groups to take the arena. It is a ffa raid, people join, and leave as they wish, and there is no real target for the raid. We do these raids and hope something named will be up. Armor is a bonus, but it is really done as a get together, and for some who are still not on CoV faction to get it for ToV. Vindi was up this time, and we massed to take him. Farming Kael armor can be done with one group, and is done by some guildies I believe. We do not however, at any point amass 5 groups in Kael to farm armor, it would be tedious and an impractical waste of our resources.  <p>&lt;img align=top src=&quot;http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif&quot;&lt;/img&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br>

So people are just stupid for not jumping up and throwing stones as a angry mob.  People have no right to ask you when you post something for some clarification, before they make up their mind? <br>
<br>
Not more than a month ago I saw SoY being praised on these boards.  <br>
<br>
SO you prick if someone asks for clarification maybe its just that......clarification.  I sure the hell know that I would have the balls to brought this up in OOC or in tells with SoY LONG before the pull was even made. <br>
<br>
You all sat there for a hour and didnt comunicate with SoY?  No tells were exchanged....no one from CoN asked to talk to a officer from SoY, no more OOC's were made?  Nothing? You all just watched SoY form up in strength for over an hour and didnt say ANYTHING to them?  YOU didnt ask them what their intentions where?  The officers from CoN never sent a tell or asked to talk to the SoY raid leader?  <br>
<br>
That is what I find hard to believe because I have never seen 2 guilds, who you can pretty much bet were going for the same mob, not communicate or talk for over a hour.  While both were amassing in the same zone.<br>
<br>
It was also stated that you were clearing for Vindi and by a member of CoN &quot;you were getting ready for hours&quot;......ummm with 35 people there....shouldnt getting to the arena and clearing the arena take all of about 20 minutes?  If you were just &quot;waiting for more to arrive&quot; then with 35 people there...shouldnt the arena have been totally cleared of all mobs besides vindi?  3 groups can clear the arena and the trash mobs down below the arena in about 30 mins (including the protectors).  So 35 should be able to clear it in what 15 min?  <br>
<br>
So before I jump ship and condem SoY who were praised here less than a month ago, can you clarify those issues's?  Don't worry us dumb fucks catch on after awhile. <p><center><BR><font color= Blue><BR><i>Granitfist/Jeribu<i/><BR><i>GrandMaster/High Priest<i/><BR><i>Co-Leader of Circles End<i/><BR><i>The Rathe<BR><center><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370733">The Monk </> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370756">The Cleric<i/>

I don't know what your EQ screen looks like, but mine certainly does not appear as a guard room in a crowded mall. I don't have cameras at every corner of the zone so I can see what's going on all around. Why should CoN assume, after informing SoY that we were after Vindi, that they would not leave. Why should our members constantly be hitting / to see who's in the zone? There is no reason. If you read the logs, you will see that one of our members says at some point Lots of SoY in the zone. If you had paid attention you would realized that CoN didn't know SoY was forming up. If we did, someone wouldn't be restating fact we were all already aware of. <br>
<br>
In the less than an hour between our calling Vindi, and Ken shouting he was pulling, fighting, and preparing was going on. I doubt if anyone was sitting there spastically checking who was in the zone don't you? The logs are all you need to see. The fact that not one SoY has come up with logs yet to the contrary is proof enough. Please do not call Ranquill a prick, that is something he CERTAINLY is not. Ugly? Maybe, but not a prick, he is one of the nicer people in the game.  <p>&lt;img align=top src=&quot;http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif&quot;&lt;/img&gt; &lt;br&gt;<br>
