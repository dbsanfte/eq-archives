Please accept my apologies if you think I was calling anyone a liar, that was not my intention at all.  I don't word things very well sometimes, but after reading it I can see. <br>
<br>
I think after reading Gromms Points and Thaldin, I guess it was just a clarity issue where the agreement was only known to the ones on the rotation.  It was just that when guilds got bigger they didn't know cause nothing was posted.  So really can't really blame anyone.  <br>
<br>
I do worry though, cause as guilds get bigger, will we run into this again?  What named Mobs are guilds gonna have to check on to find out if they are part of a rotation?   <p><center><image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif><b><i>"Big Bad Bonedaddy"</i></b><image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif><BR>

<br>
There were no guidelines specified publicly about Doze and the Named Drakes and I don't want the members, guild leader or officers of SoY viewed as not comprehending said guidelines. It's a little different from the &quot;I didn't see the stop sign&quot; theory. We know there are stop signs from the guidelines presented to you in the manual you get at the DMV. Looking for the stop signs is up to you.<br>
<br>
We looked for the guidelines about the written Rotations (as of yesterday being Doze and NToV and not Doze and named) and there were none about the named drakes. Doesn't mean we don't comprehend or adhere to Rathe Rotation mob policies.<br>

&quot; Its like saying dont kill the golems in Fear anymore cause they are now on the Cazic Rotation. Well that just screwed the people who have been able to kill the golems and not CT. &quot;<br>
<br>
This wouldn't happen.. why? Because the golems' loot isn't directly linked to CT's loot. The drakes DROP NOTHING but the symbols that must be included with Dozekar tears. I am not even sure they have a chance to drop armor, but they might.<br>
<br>
If you're not on the Doze rotation and killing named drakes, you're one of the following generalizations: a) no idea that they're linked to Dozekar in any meaningful way, b) Know exactly what they drop and kill them to hoard symbols till the day you can kill dozekar, c) kill them because you kill dozekar too.<br>
<br>
Choice A happens.. and I don't think that's the issue.  I think B is the issue because  guilds on the Doz rot feel that they're being taken advantage of by guilds soon to be on the Doz rot who are planning ahead.<br>
<br>
If you KNOW what these named have, and you're killing them without being able to kill Doze.. then you're directly crapping on the spirit of the rotations in general.<br>
<br>
As for the other part, KIC did kill the named a few times before they killed Doze.. but once KIC realized the impact it had, they stopped.<br>
<br>
Most of the guilds capable of HoT/planning on killing Doze are NOW aware of the impact (if they weren't before, and doing it anyway).  It will be interesting to see if the drakes stay alive or people still kill them out of rotation or out of turn.<br>

<br>
As an aside, since then, we've been hunting HoT almost every weekend, and I don't think we've even seen one of the named drakes up. We have found Dozekar up a few times, though. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I could care less about the Dozekar rotation...if the named drakes are part of it, works for me. I'm just a poor cleric who's tired of having to res my guildmates because of would-be Dozekar slayers pushing through HoT (and then training us while they CR) when we were there first. You have 24 hours to kill Dozekar...we only do HoT for a few hours a week. Is a little respect for the camp really that much to ask?<br>

  I've read this entire thread, several times over actually, and many have had valid points on both sides of the issue. It seems although we have yet to come to a consensus with respect to the Dozekar issue, we all seem to be leaning towards the general consensus that the issue is made more complex by the &quot;Dozekar incapable yet named capable&quot; guilds involved and that more thought is required to solve this issue. I'm glad to see that this is being addressed. <br>
<br>
  What hasn't yet been addressed directly and frankly is the real reason behind why the Dozekar capable guilds want the named to be on the same rotation, at least not comprehensively. The reason is loot, simply put. The &quot;Dozekar capable&quot; guilds seem to have found the quest items from the Named elusive, more so than the Dozekar quest items. So having the named up each time they do Doze is very convenient. Yet, the &quot;Dozekar incapable&quot; guilds would sure like to get a head start collecting those elusive quest items prior to getting themselves on the Dozekar rotation so that when they are capable of doing Dozekar each kill very well may represent another completed quest. I don't blame them for this either. But here is a question for you. If the Named mobs involved in the quests were not in the same zone (as is the case with many quests), would they still be considered on the same rotation? If Cazic Thule and say, Wuoshi dropped two items for the same quest would they reside on the same rotation? Or would Wuoshi remain a rotationless mob? (Silly example but you get my meaning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
  Another question, unrelated to Dozekar but still having the general spirit of the discussion here. Should a guild not be allowed to farm PoF if they are incapable of killing Cazic Thule himself? No? Then why can they not farm NToV without killing the boss mob there? Why is it such a sin to enjoy the available content in partial form, the part you are currently capable of? Because the rotation guilds do not benefit from it? Well, of course that's the reason. Do I necessarily disagree? Hmm, perhaps you should ask when I am on that rotation....  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  Don't get me wrong. I recognize fully that the &quot;lesser&quot; guilds benefit greatly from these rotations as well, perhaps more than the current rotation guilds. I for one would hate to be racing &quot;uber&quot; guilds to many of the mobs I am capable of killing now. But at the same time I am being denied content I am now currently capable of for fear of being steamrolled lest I adhere to our current rotational rules.<br>
<br>
  Somehow, it still leaves me dissatisfied.<br>
<br>
  Please be aware that my comments here in no way imply that they are necessarily representative of my guild as a whole.<br>

<br>
The unwritten rule of the Doze rotation as established by the rotation founders were that named + doze are a package. That's fine, and worked well at that time, especially since 'random spawn timers' werent in place at that time.<br>
<br>
Now there are 5 or so guilds on this rotation, and the named spawn at all times. What if the 3 others ALL would prefer the drakes to be FFA instead?  Does the majority rule in this case? How would this be handled?<br>

The bigger guilds are used to having to talk to each other, we do it on a daily basis.  You newer (newer meaning newer to these rotations) are not used to doing this, so we are trying to get the information out there for everyone.<br>
<br>
Should we have done this sooner?  Yes.  But we're human too, we do make mistakes.  We are now trying to correct that, and have the information out there for all.<br>
<br>
Gromm, we should get a post up about Glyphed/Exiled for general info too. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uemilsinclair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 315<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 6:17:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A few months ago...</span><hr size=1> Jurrasic Epoch said:<br>

Now there are 5 or so guilds on this rotation, and the named spawn at all times. What if the 3 others ALL would prefer the drakes to be FFA instead? Does the majority rule in this case? How would this be handled?<br>
<br>
-- This would bring up a case of 'using the rotations to your advantage, while at the same time, ignoring the rotations to your advantage'  It is unacceptable, and has come up now and again thru our history.  If you do not wish to follow established rotations, for your own good (read: banking drakes until you can kill doz) then the 'rotation machine' will not be abliged to protect your other mobs you have safely reserved for you, whatever mobs they may be.<br>
<br>
in a nutshell, you cant sit on the fence, regarding the rotational system.<br>
<br>
and ill restate whats been said 1000 times above:<br>
<br>
- dozekar: ~7 day pop, drops 1/2 the items for the CoV quests<br>
- drakes: ~ day pop, drops other half of the items for the CoV quests.<br>
<br>
---if you kill drakes, and can't kill doz, you are (a) oblivious to what they are for/how they are handled (forgivable) (b) self serving, and planning for the CoV quests, looking to gain a head start.<br>
<br>
There is really no other alternative.  If you are planning for Doz/CoV quests, then you are 'sitting on the fence' as it has been clearly (and rationally i think) explained why these 2 entities (doz+drakes) are treated as a single package.<br>
<br>
Please, trust me - when you enter the doz rot you will highly, endlessly appreciate the drakes protected for YOU, when you are up.<br>
<br>
--edit:<br>
<br>
to directly adress jurassic's question:  This still applies to the 'sitting on the fence' analogy -<br>
<br>
&quot;I want a mob(s) ffa when it serves me, but damn right, i still want statue of rz, tormax, zlan, etc.. to be protected by a rotation for ME!!!&quot;  its principles, you are either pro FFA, or pro-share/rot.  It is impossible (ethically i suppose) to pick and choose how you want to act, as it serves you.<br>

<br>
Killing the drakes yields NO loot except quest items.<br>
<br>
I think only one quest requires 4 Tears from Dozekar where all the rest require a combination there of.<br>
<br>
Logically, to make Dozekar worth while to kill, you need to kill the named drakes along with him, hence how it was decided it was a package deal.  Even after the advent of the random spawn timers (Blah), the guilds on the rotation were able to keep it as a package deal for the most part.<br>
<br>
There was an occasional accidental killing from time to time of the named drakes by HOT farming guilds, but it was worked out.  To keep all this intact isn't that difficult, it's just asking the people that are there to be a little more careful.<br>
<br>
I know the pull routes inside the HoT like the back of my hand...I should after all this time, and I can say for a fact, you can farm the left side of the Dozekar room (facing in from the door) without ever touching a named Drake.  They all spawn behind and to the right of the room.  Unless you fight to the exit, you can avoid ever killing the named drakes this way. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthaldin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thaldin</A> at: 9/16/02 3:27:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujurrasicepoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 474<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 6:41:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> Thank you for replying Emil, but I don't believe that it DOES answer my question.<br>
<br>
Though the named and Dozekar ARE linked in that the two 'parts' from each complete the quests, they are NOT the same mob.  <br>
<br>
While the initial founders of the rotation decided to make them a package deal, it does not have to be this way. <br>
<br>
Otherwise you could make the claim that all VP medallion mobs and ground spawns are part of the Trakanon rotation and must never be killed by non Trakanon guilds or rot guilds not currently up for Trakanon.<br>
<br>
The question was IF the majority of Dozekar rotation guilds didn't care to check HoT every day for their named to spawn and decided that it was just as easy to 'take em when you want em' (and there have been times that Doze is killed multiple times before the named are touched) does the majority rule in this decision to remove the named from the rotation? why or why not?<br>
<br>
Again please keep in mind that this is hypothetical, and FK as a Dozekar rotation guild makes no position for or against a change at this time, but it should be hashed out as I have a funny feeling that this sort of issue may well come up in the future with 'linked' mobs in PoP, as well as with Doze now.<br>

<br>
Verant screwed up BADLY when they put the drakes on such a random spawn timer.  The drakes will be in the way of guilds pulling for armor, and rotation guilds will have difficulty waiting until the drakes are fully spawned to clear them.  The drake symbols -are- the bottleneck in all of the most desirable Dozekar quests, the drop rates are horrible, and you can typically farm enough tears to complete 4 quests before you can get the symbols to complete one. <br>
<br>
Verant should put these drakes on a three-day spawn timer and then we can -could- just call the drakes FFA and be done with it (Although you guilds who still need Skyshrine armor might not realize what a nightmare that would be to your farming attempts when you add NB/Tindi and BOTS to your competition for HOT).  Verant hasn't done this however, so we must make do as best we can.<br>
<br>
Now, to speak against my fellows...  BOTS, Tindi and NB: Get off your asses.  If you want to be on the Dozekar rotationt then be prepared to accept the responsibility for the nightmare of that rotation.  Dozekar needs to be a TOP priority.  On spawn day, you guys need to be sitting there waiting to catch drakes.  That's simply what it takes to be responsible for the other guilds who need to farm the armor that comes out of there.<br>
<br>
I speak against BOTS here, because they're ahead of us in the rotation and that's just the guild I see, but too often BOTS will be busy doing more important things and pass Doze/named late in the day after the drakes have already been robbed.  The rotation passes to Noble Blade and we see that we've been passed Doze and one or two of the eight drakes, and of course we pass rather than 'waste' our turn on a worthless doze kill (We don't really need many tears) and one chance at a symbol rather than eight.<br>
<br>
This is why the stuff gets left up so long.  If you're on the rotation, make it a priority on the level with your VT farming or whatever your doing at the moment.  Take responsibility for a difficult rotation, and don't leave the stuff up to be stolen and then pass the buck.<br>

<br>
You want Named Drakes FFA?  Fine.  I'll be there with 20-30 NB EVERY patch.  We NEED Named drake to finsh quests, not Doze.  You think you can beat NB, TL and BotS to Named?  We all need them to complete our quests.  Every patch we will be there, killing all the armor giving mobs, because yea I have some twinks that could use armor.  BotS will be 3 screens away camping 2 other Named, and Tindi will be in another spot camping those named.  Every 7 days, every patch.  This is what will happen if Named Drake go FFA.  You think you'll get alot of armor farming in while we're there?<br>
<br>
Or... Doze and Named are treated as one rotation like they are now.  The guild thats up for Doze comes in once a week, for 2-3 hours and then is gone, and you can farm armor all the rest of the time.<br>
<br>
You think we wouldn't love for named drake to be FFA?  We complete 1 Doze quest every 1-2 months now.  If named drakes were FFA we would be there everytime they spawned, making sure we were there before you to kill them.  We could probably complete 3-4 quests in the first month alone.<br>
<br>
But thats not what rotations are about.  Rotations are here to fairly share the resources of the server between all that can kill them. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unicolaiironcross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicolai IronCross</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>tba</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 6:58:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=63>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A few months ago...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yet, the &quot;Dozekar incapable&quot; guilds would sure like to get a head start collecting those elusive quest items prior to getting themselves on the Dozekar rotation so that when they are capable of doing Dozekar each kill very well may represent another completed quest. I don't blame them for this either.&quot;<br>
<br>
The reason most of the Dozekar capable guilds are asking for this is because of the rotation system itself. We as a community agree to share nicely on the big important mobs. These drakes constitute a directly necessary linke to Dozekar. There is NO other use for the named drakes. <br>
<br>
If Dozekar himself was FFA, then it is highly likely that the guilds sniping Nameds (knowingly, not the accidental stuff) would *never* or *extremely rarely* ever be able to even USE those symbols. Sharing is a give and take, and has a long history of being a double-edged sword on this server.<br>
<br>
From my personal observation, this is one of those blatant instances where the tier 1 guilds are taking it in the rear by playing nice.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Edit: Figured I would answer Jurassic with my speculation <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *<br>
<br>
Technically, I would think that all entities that are currently part of the rotation get a say; but the original deal was those guilds who founded a particular rotation (in this case, NB and Tindi) set the policy as long as either is active in the rotation.<br>
<br>
It's a house of cards obviously, and always has been. People depend on the good intentions of everyone involved for this to work. Obviously, from the tone of the posts by NB, Tindi, and BoTS.. they don't feel like people are acting with the best of intentions in regards to this situation.<br>
<br>
I will re-iterate what Milambus pointed out though, just because someone has access to the named now (mainly because half of the rotation thinks people are leaving them up per the agreement)... doesn't mean that same someone would *ever* see them if they went FFA.<br>

<br>
<br>
Yes it does have to be this way, and Emil's post does answer your question.  Doing it any other way is counter to the whole concept of rotating mobs to share amongst those who can benefit from the mobs in question.  The Named without Dozekar are nothing.  Dozekar without the Named is nothing.  To use rotations to your favor (i.e. ensure you get shots at Dozekar) and then ignoring the parts you don't like (i.e. wanting to grab not just your share of Drakes, but everyone's) is greedy and self-centered.<br>
<br>
As for your VP analogy, if the symbols for Doze quests were 8 hour ground spawns all over Velious, I can promise you, NB would have a lot more Doze quests completed.  I would also say that anyone not in a guild that kills Trakanon who collects VP key pieces is wasting their bank space.  I would say the same about VT shards.  If you aren't in a guild actively gathering Emperor keys, you are just wasting your bank space and preventing other players who can use those items better.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I would caution you about trying to make the Named Drakes FFA, as I would make sure that NB took full advantage of said system, if only to prove a point that rotations benefit you a lot more than they do &quot;the big guilds&quot;.  I prefer to share the pie as equally as possible, but if you don't want to play nice on the playground, we can go that way too. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

<br>
I think a lot of folks fail to realize that HoT can be cleared (minus Dozekar) by a single well equipped, experienced group and Dozekar can be killed easily with 3 groups of the same.  I know the few times BotS has killed Dozekar we've done it at around 3am or later Eastern time with 17 to 24 people.  It would eventually fall to being a pick-up group situation where people of any guild would group and go kill the mobs and split the things they drop if it went FFA, and that is something that is hard to compete with even for the larger guilds. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 9/16/02 4:10:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilambus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RTA Admin</span><br>  Posts: 822<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 7:03:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/profile/fist1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A few months ago...</span><hr size=1> Jurrasic to answer the question: <br>

Rotations rules/etc are created via discussion.  If all the Doze guilds got together and after discusion agreed to make the named FFA then thats what would happen.  Its not just a simple vote for each rule.  Rotations are package deals that are compromises that the guild on the rotation make.<br>
<br>
So can the rule be changed?  Sure.  Can you convince the other guilds that such a change is best?  Maybe.<br>

For Karadin for the 4th time I have no intention nor does FK of pushing for the drakes to be made FFA, that's not at all what this question was about. It was just a very handy and relevent example. <br>

And back directly ON the doze/named situation, I hope Borick's excellent post dosen't get buried.<br>

 If 'elder' rotation guilds kept closer tabs on the named (yes Verant sucks for making them random) there will a lot less 'sniping' from groups camping armour or doze capable guilds looking for symbols.   <p>Jurrasic Epoch <BR>
