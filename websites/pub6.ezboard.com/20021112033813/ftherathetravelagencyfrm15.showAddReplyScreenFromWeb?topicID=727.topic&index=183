You know what else is easy to do from behind a PC? <br>

Stop nuking a mob that is not yours, and then not spam /loot the body. That's even easier than being merciless, because all it requires is that you not be a moron. <br>

Uh, that wasn't an apology. That was, at best, an attempt to divert attention away from the fact that he posted about how he didn't ninja loot, he KS'd and that you should expect that, and then the little bit about Fablaar &gt; Scaleslayerx2, you know, where he gloated about KSing. The attempt to flame in an apology, negates ANY value it had as a 'real' apology. It's like saying &quot;Gee, Fablaar, I'm sorry you are such an asshole'. Is *that* an apology? No. And incorrect information is better known as 'misrepresenting the facts' so that his position looks better. Calling Jurrasic the devil so that he could skip over his valid points. Saying that he insulted me so that he could skip over my valid points. He could have said &quot;They just don't like me because I'm an admitted Kill Stealer and I gloat about it when I can&quot;.<br>

Bullshit. He's not admitting he's wrong, he's trying to cover his ass because someone finally got it into his head that he's wrong, was wrong to start and will finish wrong. It's called 'damage control' but Fablaar is shitty at it. Balls to admit he was wrong? If anything, he's doing the 'tail between the legs' because he got called on being an asshole. <br>
<br>
The question to ask is not &quot;How many of you would?&quot; but rather &quot;How many of you would attempt to KS the ancient cyclops, then ninja loot the body when you fail to KS it, then come to the flame boards and post about how good you are because you were able to ninja the item?&quot; That's the question.<br>

I think that's just the point Rathermon. None of us (well, the ones that didn't know him anyway) had a problem with him. We judged him on his chosen words and actions, and we still are. Since we didn't know him before hand, we can certainly post with objectiveness on his behavior and responce to being called on it. Saying that we didn't have a problem with him before he KS/Ninja looted a mob is moot, why the hell would that matter? The fact that he ninja/ks'd and then came to the rtas with a &quot;Look what I done ma!&quot; style post in which he MAKES FUN OF THE PERSON HE TRIED TO KS AND THEN NINJA'D FROM IS EXACTLY WHY WE ALL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM!!!! People with playstyles like his are the reasons for 95% of the problems in this game between players. Reasonable people meet up with shitsticks like Fablaar, and have their day ruined. We all react to that because we've all dealt with an ass like him before. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Yeah, I could see 'out of character' if he came to the boards and said &quot;look guys, sorry, I was having a bad day, and I'd been looking for the ancient cyclops for 60 levels now, I'm sorry, I'll multiquest the ring for Scaleslayer, my bad, won't happen again&quot;. But he came in and went off about how he was super duper powerful because he KS'd a level 30ish mob. No, it is painfully obvious where this players character and morals lie. <br>
<br>
If he wants to play Unreal Tournament, or Counter Strike, be my guest. Just don't do it while you're playing Everquest. <br>

I am one of the anonymous HUNDREDS of EQ Players on the Rathe that goes about our business quietly, honestly, and without much notice from anyone.  Like them,  I don't Kill-Steal, Ninja-Loot, Maliciously-Train, or Camp-Steal from anybody.  Like them, I play nice and avoid conflict when possible.<br>
<br>
I, along with these Hundreds, don't have a 'Rep'.  We follow the rules.  We follow the etiquette.  We do our jobs in groups.  We support our guilds.  We support our friends. We do all these things without much notice from anyone.<br>
<br>
I, along with these anonymous hundreds, know reputations.  I am a nobody.  I'm thinking you wish you were about now.<br>

I just LOVE playing with the devil!<br>
<br>
When I first started playing EQ, I was told over in Oasis that Lockjaw was a FFA mob. I didn't know what that meant. I was told to just fight him with everyone else and hope you get the kill for his uber loot. That was 3 years ago with my first character in her young teens. It didn't take long to find out (and thankfully without me actually KS'ing someone on a so-called FFA mob) that the info I had been given was wrong. I can somewhat accept this kind of behavior from someone brand new to the game figuring they are like I was: misinformed. But you would think by the time you hit your 30's, much less 50's, that you'd know not to do that.<br>
<br>
Yes, the KS and/or ninja was bad. The gloating of it was bad. The taunting of other people here that rightfully pointed out the err of Fab's ways has been bad. But the so-called apology just plain sucks. It reminds me of someone else I tend to harrass when I see 'em fucking up... shallow apologies with a disclaimer of &quot;I did nothing different from what others have done in the past&quot; just doesn't qualify as an apology. Once again we have someone diverting the truth away from them while totally lacking in the ability to admit they were wrong and unwilling to quit looking at others to justify their own behavior.<br>
<br>
I don't know you as far as having chatted with you goes. But I do think I know enough from your posts here to be able to know all I need to know. <br>
<br>
Those that think guild tags and reps don't go hand-in-hand are dead wrong! I won't hesitate to remove someone from my guild if they go against our charter and what we believe in. I will hesitate not only in letting someone with a questionable rep in joining the guild, but also in my groups. I know I am not alone in this attitude and practice either.<br>
<br>
For those that argue its just a game: its NOT! I really am an Iksar monk, a wood elf druid and rogue, a high elf chanter, mage, and cleric, a barbarian shaman, a gnome wizard, a dwarf, etc.<br>
<br>
Ok, I digressed a bit. Now its time to find the devil to play with! /who devil all <p><BR>
