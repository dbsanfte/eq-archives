Just like Velious keys. I remember when people had to trek thru Kael and WL/Skyshrine to get their portal keys. But of course SoE goes back on everything they do.<br>

I was lucky and got thru trials no problem.. and now being a 65 Wizard I get asked for trials help almost daily. I don't mind helping.. but now.. whats the point.. just wait and SoE will let the floodgates open.<br>

By this time, the noobs who wanted in were getting in anyway thanks to guild raids intended to get members flagged.<br>
<br>
And so you worked hard? Now that they removed the flags, does that make your accomplishment any less admirable? You worked hard and you accomplished a difficult (at least at first) task. Be proud of it! I worked hard to get the first part of my epic. If they nerfed it and made it simpler to get, why should I care? I worked hard, accomplished, and moved on.<br>
<br>
And you spent lots of time fighting for exp with n00bs prior to PoP. You're used to it! No big deal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grulnick>Grulnick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User and Abuser!</span><br>  Posts: 698<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/13/03 11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1183.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re</span><hr size=1> Karadin, I respect your opinion and I fully see your side of it.<br>
<br>
I worked hard for the flags I have too, which was hard not being guilded.<br>
<br>
You think the time you spend playing this game is worth more than the time others spent in the real world earning real money? I don't think you do, but if you do you're wrong.<br>
<br>
VI said they will reward  you for that work, so you will still have something for your work. One restricted zone is no big deal, but when there are like 10 and the only real way to get in them all is to join a guild, then all of a sudden it's like being guilded is a requirement for PoP, that's stupid because that wasn't in the manual when I bought it.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I would have to say no, kiling those mobs is not all that hard, and I don't think you have any right whatsoever to restricted access zones.<br>
<br>
And, by removing the restrictions, VI is proving my point.<br>
<br>
You see, some people can't join big uber guilds like bots and tindi and FK. Because they don't have time, or they don't have friends, or they post on boards and start flames <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , or they whatever.

<br>
Now what about that would lead you to believe (especially after the first bullet) that this expansion was a big experience zone.  The way I read it, I am getting 18 new high level zones and that they are all tied together in one quest.  As a matter of fact, Sony doesn't even promise you 18 new zones.  They state, <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Up to 18 new planar zones<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
So this, they promised me and didn't deliver is complete and utter nonsense.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You see, some people can't join big uber guilds like bots and tindi and FK. Because they don't have time, or they don't have friends, or they post on boards and start flames <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
By the same logic you are using, I could make the point that my tradeskills suck because I spend so much time raiding.  Therefore, SoE should max all my tradeskills to 250.  It is exactly the same point.  Both are timesinks, but getting flagged is not nearly as bad.  This is the same gripe I have seen on EQ for the last couple of years...  &quot; XXXX has some better gear/aa/exp technique/loot than me, please nerf it or give me the same gear/aa/exp technique/loot.  It just isn't fair.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And, by removing the restrictions, VI is proving my point.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I beg to differ with you on this point.  VI is actually proving my point.  You no longer need to do anything in EQ anymore.  Just wait long enough and SoE will appease the lazy.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>One restricted zone is no big deal, but when there are like 10 and the only real way to get in them all is to join a guild<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There is a single group doable and flaggable quest for nearly every one of the zones that they are giving away now, so that argument does not hold water.  Realistically only a few of those zones would not be &quot;gimme's&quot;. <br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> and I don't think you have any right whatsoever to restricted access zones.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
so essentially what you are telling me is that you should just be given a VP, ST, and VT key?  Since the first expansion, EQ has closed off zones to the &quot;general public&quot; to reward the players that took the time and effort to do the horrific timesinks that they refer to as quests.  This is nothing new.  This is just a whole buch of mini quests that are linked into one &quot;compelling&quot; quest.<br>
<br>
In any case the whiners win.  Some people quested their way into the zones,  others killed.  The collective whining of the EQ impaired has achieved what took my guild hundreds of man hours, access to all planes below the elementals (excluding the tower of sol ro and HoHb).  You will have to forgive me if I withhold my congratulations.<br>

Since the release of PoP, there has been an increasingly large gap in the membership of guilds such as mine between the 60+ power gamer and the 50-59 casual gamer.  If this change is implemented, it means that we can actually hold raids worth DKP in Tactics or BoT or even PoS Lords or PoS events without subjecting a third of our members to watching from the sidelines.  As a raid leader, this opens up a lot of new possibilities that would have previously been ignored when we are looking for something to do as a guild.  <br>
<br>
Further, it eliminates the need for PoJ &quot;flagging parties&quot; where we try to get gain second tier flags for the 55+ crowd, not the easiest endeavor.  The pressure on our 65 tanks, wizards, enchanters and clerics will also be reduced as a result.  <br>
<br>
Of course, there are negatives.  I will miss the ease that I have had finding solo spots in some of the more sparsely populated zones or the possibility of getting a group as a druid in places like Tactics.  <br>
<br>
Certainly this change will open more of the world up to &quot;idiots&quot; like has been mentioned repeatedly above.  I would argue that unless they are completely bereft of any grouping skills, anyone level 60+ could have eventually survived the Trial of Execution in a pickup group, provided they had a little patience.  Many of these so-called idiots are already in these zones and are busy training zones and kiting in graveyards.  I doubt that such incidents will increase by very much after this change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bogfatherbellybarsh>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>For the last time, I came back!</span><br>  Posts: 1512<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/13/03 2:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1183.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://media.ign.com/boards/images/icons/other_stfuget.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No more trials</span><hr size=1> Do none of you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>UNDERSTAND?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This will effectively destroy all chance of some people getting groups.  This will clog BoT and POV with even more newbies and pissants.  Do you think they're busy now? Wait until you get peak time.

But knowing my luck, that will probably clog with morons too.  <br>
<br>
I think it's fine and dandy people will be able to raid tactics, but it now makes behemoth feel just that little less appetising.  And real morons, gat, don't have patience.  Incidents will double, as will idiocy.<br>

<br>
I can't even imagine what is going on in the minds of all the Chanters, Clerics, Shammies, etc. that spent countless weeks flagging their entire guild through the Executioner trial.<br>
<br>
At least they are keeping the fact that you will need the flags to continue to move through the elementals, etc.  At least that time wasn't a complete waste.<br>

Yes it takes away from all the hard work of getting the flag for a zone or a section of a zone.<br>
On the other hand I grew extremely tired of zoning into Plane of Storms and for 2 entire months the Diaku camp was occupied. Every single day the camp was occupied when I went to look.<br>
I am really looking forward to the &quot;Old zone&quot; revamps that will allow 61+ experience.<br>
