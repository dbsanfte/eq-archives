Sadly there is very little information on Kojiro. There was a movie made about him, but few books or internet sites have any information on him. <br>
<br>
The reason his name has lasted though is that he dueled (and lost) to Miyamoto Musashi (the most famous Japanese Swordsman ever) on Ganryujima Island in 1612. This is probably the most well-known sword duel in Japanese history actually. You can find several accounts of it on the web, in books, and quite a few movies. I provide an excerpt here for your enlightenment:<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
Sasaki Kojiro (Ganryu) (Funajima, Kyushu. April 14th 1612) <br>
<br>
After making a name for himself in an around the Kyoto area Musashi traveled to Kyushu, the 2nd largest island in the Japanese archipelago (Honshu being the main island). Musashi was staying with one Nagaoka Sado, a retainer of the Hosokawa, Daimyo of the area, when he found out that the celebrated fencer Sasaki Kojiro was also a guest of the Hosokawa. <br>
<br>
Sasaki Kojiro was famed as being the strongest swordsmen in Southern Japan.. He was, at the time, 40 years of age and had created his own fencing style - Ganryu Ryu. He was said to be a man of compassion and integrity and, combined with his superior fencing talent, was thought highly by all, including the Hosokawa. <br>
<br>
Musashi saw this as an opportunity. Due to the fact that Ganryu was a guest of the Hosokawa and Musashi was a guest of one of their retainers things had to be handled officially and go through the correct channels. This withstanding, Ganryu accepted and permission was granted for the duel. The time and place were set to be the early morning of April 14th 1612 on Funajima, a small island. <br>
 <br>
On the night before the duel, Musashi took leave of Sado’s residence and got a room in an inn in the vicinity of the next days match. The next day saw the area around Funajima filling up with a small flotilla of boats full of spectators coming to see the soon to be infamous duel. <br>
<br>
Ganryu arrived at Funajima at the appointed time - 8am - carrying a fearsome and extra long sword made by the famous swordsmith Bizen Osamitsu. Ganryu also dressed for the occasion wearing a crimson Haori and formal Iga-Bakama. Musashi, however, was not there. When officials found him he was still asleep! He was woken up and, despite exclamations to the contrary, took his time breakfasting before setting out towards the Island. Was this another example of Musashi’s deliberate time-delay strategy (see the Musha-Shugyo section) ? Musashi was wearing his normal clothing and the sword he was to use was a wooden one carved, as is legendary, from a wooden oar on his way to the duel! <br>
 <br>
The actual duel itself was to take legendary status. Here was the older, more experienced and well thought of fencing instructor facing off against a rough-looking and younger swordsman who was infamous yet considered as something of an anomaly socially. Ganryu was dressed the part, turned up on time and was armed with a highly-crafted weapon - Musashi was dressed as normal, arrived late, and was using a rough sword he himself whittled from an oar. This was an epic in the making. As they faced of Ganryu was said to have thrown his scabbard onto the beach. With this Musashi proclaimed ‘Sasaki, you have sealed your doom.’ Sasaki was nonplused and Musashi explained further : ‘What victor on earth would ever abandon his sheath to the sea?’ There was a stand off- then suddenly both struck down at each others heads. Musashi’s head band was cut in two whereas Ganryu staggered back. Musashi has narrowly avoided death and at the same time had found his mark. Ganryu was not yet defeated, but the next exchange of blows saw Musashi as the victor; Ganryu was dead. Musashi bowed to the officials, got back on board the boat that took him to the island, then left. He never looked back.   <p><font face="Ariel" size=+2><span style=color:#3366FF'><a

You seem to be quite knowledgable about japanese history and i've always wondered something...<br>
<br>
In Final Fantasy (and for that matter alot of Japanese RPG console games) there is usually two swords with special names: Masamune, and Murasame....<br>
<br>
Just wondering if you happen to know or can point me to a good URL describing these blades...though they may just be names and nothing more.<br>

Hopefully someone will come along who has better information. <br>
<br>
Masamune is a name actually. I would assume that when they are referring to Masamune they mean the swordsmith who lived during the Kamakura Era. However, they could be referring to the blade of Lord Masmune Date who was a leader during the wars leading up to the formation of the Tokugawa Dynasty. Kind of hard to tell on this one. I would guess they are talking about Masamune the Swordsmith though.<br>
<br>
Wait, just read the second name. Murasame was also a Swordsmith who studied UNDER Masamune. They are definitely talking about Swordsmiths here. There is an interesting story about Murasame and Masamune swords. Here it is for your reading pleasure:<br>
<br>
=========================================<br>
<br>
To test a sword crafted by the master smith Muramasa, its owner held the blade's edge against the current in a stream. A leaf floated by; it touched the blade, and by the force of the current alone, it was sliced cleanly. The test was considered an ultimate trial of a sword's quality-until someone thought to try it with a sword made by Muramasa's master, the great Masamune. The Masamune sword was thrust into the stream, and another leaf swept toward it. Then, miraculously, the course of the leaf changed. It floated around the deadly edge, sailing on intact, as if the Masamune sword possessed a beneficent power beyond that for simply causing destruction. <p><font face="Ariel" size=+2><span style=color:#3366FF'><a

I can recommend some books on it, but it really depends on what you are interested in. Personally, I am interested in the Samurai and more specifically the Tokugawa Dynasty which truly fostered the 3 class system (Lords, Samurai, and Artisans/Merchants). But, that is not for everyone. I will however recommend some books for those that are interested in reading more after I talk about Musashi (one of the reasons I study Japanese History now).<br>
<br>
Miyamoto Musashi was the greatest swordsman in Japanese History. He fought over 60 personal duels and went to war 3 or 4 times. What is interesting about him is that he stopped using edged weapons after his 10th or so kill. He used wooden swords after that. When he fought Kojiro he carved his sword out of an oar on the way to the Island. He was said to have used a fence post before as a sword. There is a tale of him in his waning years where he dueled a student with 2 fans while the student used a wooden sword. He fought the student to a stand-still for an hour before the student conceded. Now that is a bad-ass.<br>
<br>
He is also the first known Japanese Swordsman to master a 2-sword technique and he later created his own style (Nitten Ichi Ryu). Ironically enough he was the first and last person to truly understand the style. He apparently had a superior physique that allowed him to perform moves that others could never duplicate. <br>
<br>
All of this made him an interesting figure, however it was what he did later in life that made him a legend and hero to Japanese culture. When he retired he became a master artisan. He created haiku, paintings, wood carvings, metallurgy, calligraphy, and ink drawings. He surmised that once you had mastered something it was easy to master anything else. It is easy because you already have gone past the steps of development needed to master a subject and can then &quot;see&quot; the path of mastery of another subject easily.<br>
<br>
Most importantly though, he wrote two books. One was &quot;The 35 Articles on the Art of Swordsmanship&quot;. However, the one he wrote just before his death was his masterpiece. &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; deals with sword strategy. However, Musashi did something that no one up to that point had done. He combined  strategy for single opponents (duels) and multiple opponents (wars) into a single strategy. <br>
<br>
In post-WWII Japan Musashi's writing found favor again among Japanese businessmen. The &quot;Business is War&quot; attitude of Japan came from Musashi's teachings. The Japanese approached business as they would a sword duel. That made (and still makes) them extremely effective negotiators. It is also the reason you will find &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; in the business section of your local bookstore.   :-)<br>
<br>

<br>
Another <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553351702">Translation</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is available from Amazon as well.<br>
<br>
There is a novel about the life of Musashi that is interesting to read. Remember that it is fiction though. It is simply titled <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/4770019572">Musashi</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
One of the most interesting tales of the Samurai is the tale of the 47 Samurai. While the following is not the book I read (I read The 47 Samurai Story), it will probably be pretty good. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0395708095">The Revenge of the Forty-Seven Samurai</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
And finally there is <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1570625522">The Art of War</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, while not a Japanese book, it was revered by all Samurai. This was and still is one of the premier books of strategy.<br>
<br>
These are by no means the end-all be-all of Japanese History, but these books are where I started. Maybe they will serve you as well as they have served me.   :-) <p><font face="Ariel" size=+2><span style=color:#3366FF'><a
