His router started messing up and he needed to reboot, he was gone less than 5 minutes and when he got back they told him he was voted out of the group and they had a cleric from guild coming.<br>
<br>
  The members of the group were <br>
<br>
   Wyled<br>
   Xaeleth<br>
   Solthen<br>
   Karmina<br>
   Orocuar<br>
<br>
 now 3 of the members of the group sent Muddlerezzer a tell saying it was not their call, last time I checked if it was a vote 3 out of 5 is a majority. The three that sent him a tell were Wyled, Karmina, and Orocuar.  It is one thing to find a replacement when someone goes LD and does not return for an extended period of time, something else entirely to get a replacement when they tell you they need to reboot and will be right back. <br>
<br>
  This kind of behavior is selfish and childish, and should have some repercussions of some form. <br>

Hello this is a game if I dont feel like playing with you then I will play with someone else in my group. I could give a shit what the rest of the group thinks, if they want the other person that bad they woulda said no.<br>
<br>
Grouping activity is to have fun let people pick an choose who they want, I kick people out my groups on a regular basis if I dont like them, wether it be because I dont like thier humor, thier Attitude or just because I dont know them and I have a friend LFG who I would prefer thier company over this groupie.<br>
<br>
Remember the keyword GAME and remember you dont need play with some one if you dont want to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baysarfk>BaysarFK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/8/03 11:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1333.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Keepers of Oak members behavior leaves a lot to be desir</span><hr size=1> I don't know you, but I know that I have had pickup groups where someone was such a fuckface that I PRAYED that they would go LD so I would have a tactful opportunity to replace them.<br>

I've been on both sides of that fence, get over it. No one owes a random stranger they're xping with anything, but you have a responsibility for your guildmates, and vice versa.  <br>

<br>
So, in your own words, your friend was having trouble with his router, and had to reboot his computer. And he's a cleric. So, if the cleric is gone off to reboot his computer the group is at a standstill, no? What is there to guarantee that he's not going to continue to have problems, thereby creating more downtime for the group?<br>
<br>
All of the folks you mentioned are among the paragons of our guild. They are patient and they are polite. If they replaced your friend with a cleric from the guild, I am sure that the reasoning was that it was better for the group as a whole. Downtime stinks for everyone, and if your friend had remained in the group and had problems it would have ruined a whole day of xp.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry your view of a whole guild has been tarnished by your friend's experience, but I can assure you that we are not petty people, and our reputation on the server speaks for itself.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, this situation does not warrant a flame. Stuff like this happens.<br>
<br>
Note: I am not an officer in KoO, and this is just my opinion, not an official guild statement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=romuluas>Romuluas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/8/03 5:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1333.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmm</span><hr size=1> This is BS, i have grouped with KoO member alot, and their have been times i have gone ld and havent been back for about 10 mins and my spot is still there waiting for me.

<br>
I think it is safe to say everyone wait at least 5 - 10 mins for someone to come back, after that we all look for replacements. From what i hear their first chanter was also having LD problems and elected to log instead of holding up the group. So WTF didnt your cleric think to do the same, instead of being selfish and expecting the group to wait for him?<br>
<br>
But hey if that is what you like to accept into your guild then so be it, just stop expecting people from other guilds to be willing to wait for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bogfatherbellybarsh>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.mmmonkeybusiness.com/jesterav.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Stand Ablaze.

<br>
As Guild Leader of KoO, I have to admit I'm a bit underwhelmed by your choice of venues to pursue this complaint.<br>
<br>
I would expect &quot;diplomacy&quot; between guilds to be conducted via tells, E-Mails or our message board (our website is easy enough to find) before you resort to &quot;Flame Central&quot; to make your point.<br>
<br>
I learned long ago that you can't please all of the people all of the time in this game, so I stopped trying and attempt to walk an honorable road through EverQuest.<br>
<br>
I apologize to you and Mudd if offense was taken.  I am following up on my end by arranging refresher courses to Dale Carnegie's next &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; seminar for all interested Keepers of Oak.<br>
<br>
I'll be happy to cover the costs for you and yours, as well.<br>
