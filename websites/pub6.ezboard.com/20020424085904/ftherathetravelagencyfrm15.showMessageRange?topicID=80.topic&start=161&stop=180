Again, you're lying.<br>
<br>
Then you say:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  I have EVERY right to go to the planes and hunt. To stay out of everyones way I go up during the day when there isn't anyone there. So what! You call a gm and tell him i am ruining your fun by zoning into a zone and hunting. And watch him Laugh in your face.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
After you've said:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; you are plain WRONG Nyca. If I zone into a zone and cause a train unintentionally which means for those of you that are a little slow &quot;if I zone in and am jumped by a train and yell train and attempt to flee train&quot; it is an unintentional train. &gt;&gt; <br>
<br>
Again, which is it?  You contradict yourself from post to post.  You may forget what lies you tell, but the rest of us don't.<br>
<br>
BotS is the only *uber* guild left on the Rathe.  And they don't go to the Planes on a daily basis.  So the only ones you are hurting are the &quot;little guys&quot;. <br>
<br>
Stealing from others for your own benefit.  Do you actually read any of what's written here?  See a few posts above where YOU ruined someone's fun by your actions. <br>
<br>
You are nothing but a hypocrite trying to justify ruining the fun of anyone that you don't consider your &quot;friends&quot;. <p>Nycah Aries'Syrensong<BR>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Since you feel you have something valuable to say and that your input is worth the time it takes to read your repeated posts and listen to your opinions, I feel it is time to address all of your concerns.  There is 1 catch here....everything will be based by what you have said in the past and as such you should by your own words drop this issue completely and actually support the calander.  In a nutshell, by your own words and &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude you have backed yourself into a wall.  You have left yourself with 2 options.  Support the calander or show everyone that you do indeed only post to stir up problems and have yourself be a focal point for attention.  All the quotes in &quot;&lt; &gt;&quot; are taken directly from the posts you have made.<br>
<br>
&lt;No one here has ever been able to give me a solid reason for this calender. Nor have they ever given me a serious answer into how this benefits EVERYONE 46 plus on the rathe&gt;<br>
<br>
The reason for the calander is to provide the people of the Rathe community a common utility for organizing and holding raids within the planes.  It is also here to establish a set of limitations in order to keep said raids running smoothly and providing an avenue to keep the peace.  (If you had been to the planes when they were first opened you would know how it was before a system such as this was implemented.  As you weren't, the basis of comparison which you hold is of little consequence.)<br>
The way in which the calander benefits everyone on the Rathe server is that those who are of level 46+ now have a way in which to go to the planes without the fear that another group/entity will also be in the zone at the same time.  This helps to control lag, trains, and more importantly the enjoyment of the plane.<br>
<br>
&lt;Your arguement is a good one anthalas but you are telling people if they do go to the planes without calender permission there will be reprecussions. This is the same as saying you can't go. They have said if you don't use the calender system then beware of ever getting a teleport or any assistance at all because you have screwed the entire rathe community....do you see where I come to my conclusions from?&gt;<br>
<br>
You obviously miss the major point most people have tried to convey to you.  No one is ever telling anyone else that they must abide by this system and that if they don't there will be reprecussions outside of this system.  Something which you must understand however is that if you do go outside of this system there are other reprecussions which you will experience.  People are not stating this as a threat, but instead as a warning that it will happen.  Those who support the calander will feel slighted by whoever does not abide by it's principals.  The calander is here in order to keep peace and bring some civility to the planes.  By you doing as you please you undermine the work of many and the beliefs of many.  If you think you are able to do so without reprecussions from anyone that is just being extremely blind.<br>
<br>
&lt;I think telling someone they have to ally themselves with anyone just to be able to go to the planes is pathetic.&gt;<br>
<br>
No one at any time has said that others must ally themselves with others in order to go to the planes.  Granted, to become a posting entity you must have a total of 40 or more level 46+ characters, but that is a rule in place to benefit the entire Rathe Community.  There are many people of that level and the limit of 40 was placed so that more people would be able to attend the planes events.  Going up there with say 24 people is causing more people to lose out on the experience.<br>
<br>
&lt;Once again you fail to realize that I do not now nor will I EVER agree, use, or consider this calender valid. When Verant tells me I have to use it then so be it. Until that point, I will continue with what I have been doing. You have no authority other than your very own power hungry, loot hungry, and pathetic attempts to make others follow you. I am not one of those people.&gt;<br>
<br>
For someone who time and time again states how mature they are and how childish everyone else is, I see how you like to label many people whom you do not know.  You do not have a very firm grasp of what this calander is for or its purpose otherwise you would know that the above statemnt is very skewed.<br>
<br>
&lt;nyca you make me laugh. you really do. From the start of this you ALL miss the point. There is no MY planes day and YOUR planes day. You CANNOT own a plane even for a day. No one can. I am not asking for you to accept &quot;my day&quot; in the planes because EVERY day belongs to EVERYONE on the RATHE. So who is on the power trip? Those who think they own it....or those that think no one owns it? Think on that a while nyca. Take your time....read it slow....you might just understand something.....&gt;<br>
<br>
Speaking of reading something slow....I think you should.  No posting Entity owns a plane.  In THIS system someone does own a plane, NOT in game.  The basis for how this system works provides ownership to an entity OUTSIDE the game.  This ownership does not transfer over into game.  This is known by those who post here and those who take part in this system.  So, who is it that is missing the point?  You might want to re-think what it is you are arguing for.<br>
<br>
&lt;nyca i made the suggestions so that EVERYONE could go. Not just those guilds who have 40plus planeable. But after seeing the reactions to the suggestions I have come to realize that you people don't want a compromise. You want it your way or no way.&gt;<br>
<br>
There must be something about the way you approach people.  Everyone on the Rathe may go to the planes.  As to it only being for guilds who have 40+ people....there are also other options.  Form an alliance for one.  Go on an Indy day is another.  Seems other options have been produced at the request of the community.  However, I did notice that after you saying all you have you neither took a part in helping Indy days become a success or even seemed to realize that they were being implemented.  Funny how you seem to take soo much interest in the events of this calander yet you fail to see what is happening.<br>
<br>
&lt;1) I am NOT claiming to own or control anything.&gt;<br>
<br>
I fail to see the point here.  No one is claiming to own anything.  And yes, this calander is controled.  That is what people claim to control.  This calander, something OUTSIDE of the game.<br>
<br>
&lt;2) I am stating the fact that I have the right to go.&gt;<br>
<br>
No one ever said you didn't have the right to go.<br>
<br>
&lt;3) I am also stating that there is NOTHING you can do about it.&gt;<br>
<br>
Of course not, but if you create a situation which ruins the play value for other people there is something GM's can do.<br>
<br>
&lt;4) If I was the power hungry one I would want to own the zones too.&gt;<br>
<br>
No one wants to own a zone.  People want to be able to have their turn and do it without outside influence.  In case you haven't realized by this time, the planes for most people is an accomplishment.  Camping re-pops and picking off of others work is not what most want to be doing in the planes.  They are going there to get some decents loots and to be able to say that yes, they can clear the planes.  Funny how that equates into being power hungry for you.<br>
<br>
&lt;5) The children on here who can't post a sentance without swearing should have their isp's notified.&gt;<br>
<br>
Narrow minded point of view.  Some people cuss as part of their vocabulary.  In case you didn't know, they are nothing more than words and most are widely accepted as such.  As for notifying peoples ISP's, not much good that would do.  As per your statement I did indeed look at my ToS for my ISP and guess what?  Doesn't say anything at all about the use of profane language.<br>
<br>
&lt;I unlike you have no need to resort to name calling, swearing, threatening, or the pathetic &quot;player made agreement&quot; crap that you people keep dishing out. I state simple easy to understand facts and because you guys can't handle it you start with the cussing and complaining.&gt;<br>
<br>
I think once again you should review all you have said.  You do call people childish, pathetic, and the like.  So that arguement is out the window.  To top that off, everytime someone responds to your complaints reasonably you seem to overlook their posts and move on to others you can feed off of.  So who can't handle what and just likes to complain?<br>
<br>
&lt;Here are your answers. I support any idea that would include EVERYONE who is planeable at ALL times to use. Not just those who can come up with 40+.&gt;<br>
<br>
Bingo, foot in the mouth.  The calander system supports EVERYONE going to the planes at this time.  At no time per the current system do you have to have 40+ people.  Have a nice day.<br>
<br>
&lt;If EVERYONE had the opportunity to use it and go and agree to it I would have no problem with it. The problem I have is not EVERYONE can go using your system. Not EVERYONE who is 46+ has agreed to your system and a lot of the new 46+ people have never even HEARD of the calender.&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, since you now support this calander as per your previous statement I guess you need to help the rest of us in making sure that the Rathe community as a whole knows about this system.  Thanks for your help! =)<br>
&lt;So that is where my problem lies. You want to do a calender like this you need to make sure you not only INCLUDE EVERYONE in it but that EVERYONE who is planeable knows about it.&gt;<br>
<br>
Everyone is included in the system.  As for everyone knowing about it there will always be those who do not know that the system exists, but they will soon find out when it comes the time for them to venture into the areas that the system covers.<br>
<br>
&lt;And for the record, I have more important things to do with my time then to play this &quot;GAME&quot; 24/7 like some of you. Unlike you I have responsibility in the real world to deal with so I do not have the time to come here.&gt;<br>
<br>
Once again an insult you try and place on others.  Yet, your so important outside real life responsibilities do not keep you from posting here day in and day out at various times.  Also, if you do not have the time to come here then why do you keep posting?  Obviously you do have the time.<br>
<br>
&lt;Ok. Here it is in a nutshell. Obviously there is NO system that will work with you people because you DO NOT wish to INCLUDE EVERYONE. Also, you cannot claim any zone for a raid for one guild. Everyone shares the right to go. So plain and simple, if you have a raid going and zone in and I am there with some friends, TOUGH. Gm's have already been notified of the current situation between me and the calender and I have given the names of people who have threatened me and you blew it off. You have no desire to hear the truth so you do what you want. But this is a promise! If you dare train me intentionally, threaten me in game, or anything else that verant's rules prohibit, I will not hesitate to report it immediately.&gt;<br>
<br>
Whether you wish to see it or not you are threatening others in this statement.  Something that you have stated you do not do and you are above.  Once again, everyone is included in the system.  As for the question of Verant supporting raids of this caliber, I suggest you furthur look into the nice policies they have put out.  Verant will have you leave the zone if you are disrupting the game play of others.<br>
<br>
&lt;Who gave you the right to make new rules on a game seeing as how you are not employed by verant?&gt;<br>
<br>
No one here has made rules to the game.  Rules have been made for a system.  This system is controled by players and not by Verant.  While the system extends into the world of which Verant has created and as such is subject to the rules and guidelines set forth by that company, in the end it is the players of this world which hold the real power.<br>
<br>
&lt;How are you going to include everyone on the server?&gt;<br>
<br>
Seems you ask this question over and over.  It has been answered time and time again.<br>
<br>
&lt;Why are you only including the large guilds?&gt;<br>
<br>
Once again another question which is based off of false information.  Everyone is included in the system, not just large guilds.<br>
<br>
&lt;Why is it that if I am the childish one and I am the bad person does one comment from me strike such a nerve with you people if you don't care what I have to say?&gt;<br>
<br>
People mostly read and post to your posts for one reason, entertainment value.  Reading your posts provides a form of entertainment for many while they are at work or what not where they would otherwise have nothing to do.  As for you being childish, a system here is being established to try and have the entire server benefit from it as a community. In a community the whole is far greater in importance than 1 person.  If so many people had problems with this system then they need to speak up and voice that opinion.  But in addition to that they need to provide ideas to either replace this one or to refine it into a better working model.  You do neither of these things.  You only set-up circumstances that in real world application are close to if not impossible to implement.  Yes, Everquest is a game but in this game you are dealing with thousands of real life people.  This is a real community and as such needs to be treated in that respect.  You must give some and in turn you will get some.  Compromise.  You providing circumstances that can never be met basically negates anything you have to say or would be working towards.<br>
<br>
In conclusion it is time to realize you are 1 person in a community.  Your personal views and goals are part of that community and do help to form and shape it but are by no means the end all be all.  You can either work to be a part and provide constructive solutions to problems you see or you can be overlooked as you are now.  You must understand that you will never get everything you want, and neither will anyone else.  You are right when you stated that even the people who originally created this calander are not always happy with it, but they still support and follow it for 1 basic reason.  There has not been a better alternative presented to replace it.  We may not all be happy with the system in all its aspects, but it is a much better solution than having no system in place.<br>
<br>

<br>
it only opens the planes up for all ONE day a month.<br>
<br>
I WANT TO GO TO THE PLANES MORE OFTEN THAN THAT AND YOU ARE PREVENTING ME YOU DO NOT OWN A ZONE.<br>
<br>
There.  I've just shown you what is going to happen on your 'system'.<br>
<br>
What do you do?<br>
<br>
Also, please to be explaining why it's ok for you to ruin the fun of other people because you think your fun is more important.<br>
<br>
Remember:  12 hour repop.  if someone is being polite and waiting their turn to go up with their friends to the planes, you are screwing them for months at a time because you decided to go up to fear and farm repops.<br>
<br>
Discuss the relative morality of robbing others of fun in order to attack a system you feel is unfair to the little guy, even if it is the little guy you are in fact hurting through said attacks.<br>
<br>

Has anyone else noticed that Jamany does more for this calendar than any other one person on the server?  His in ability to inflame others by a one sided, irrational question has inspired 150+ posts with almost all being against his point of view.  Seriously, name one guild, posting or otherwise that supports his point of view? The time spent fighting with him is time we don't fight with each other.<br>
<br>
Thanks Jamany! You keep the calendar system strong!

Im the kind of person who gets a kick out of someone who speaks on something they know nothing about. Its strange, ive never met j___ny in real life but i know what type of person she is. The type of person who if their hamburger is not cooked just right always yells for the manager, the kind of person who reads every page of a contract to look for loopholes or to use as a threat. the kind of person who tries to use threats to acheive their goals through scare tactics of rules she does not understand nor fathom. Im sorry but its true based on your posts. You make a lot of threats to get people banned for this and that. Now your trying threats about isps. Get a life. Let me put you in your little place on one thing, i work for the largest cable modem company in the world and ive been in the is field for over 8 years. So i speak from experience here. Your isp can and will do nothing about harsh language on a news board. You see, thats called censorship and thats against your first ammendment rights. The isp may ONLY act when the moderator of a said forum, meaning the person running it, tells that person to abstain from such language on their board and it is refused or it continues. At that point, if the moderator is unable to block that person from their boards, the isp will send an abuse notice to the offender and warn them that their acct will be cut off if it continues. Ussually for this to happen, it takes sever griping by the one running the abused board over and over and over. Its just not good business to play big brother and censor people. Now if you as a user, dont like what is being said or how its being said then your options are to grin and take it OR move to another board. Please notice the posted rules on the flame central. It says anything goes. Therefore you my dear j____ny dont have a leg to stand on there. Do i like the language? Nope. Do I use that language? Well, not in typed boards but you would be amazed at what i could call you in person. Do I think they should stop? Not my concern nor my right to tell them to. Now if this was sent to you in an email, THEN you have something to send to their isp who will definately take action. the email address is almost always abuse@(whatever domain).<br>
<br>
Please do continue.... i find your ignorance of issues enlightening. And yes im sure you will post some fictional conversation with an isp about this but we all know better especially me. I have yet to see an isp that says you may only speak a certain way. Just wondering by the way, would you happen to be communist? Because you sure sound like one with the rhetoric you are starting to spout <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> p<br>

<br>
&quot;Where you there?&quot;<br>
<br>
If your personal answer to this question is &quot;no&quot;, then kindly desist from spouting things in which you could have *only* have knowledge of through hearsay.  Even the people who *were* there were (self admittedly) confused as to what happened that night, with many saying that they could not say definitively what truly happened. <p><P>
