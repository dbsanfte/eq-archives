As I believe the Story goes. The Ring of Scale Incased Vox and Naggy in these lairs they are in to forbid them to meeting. See the Sleeper (In Sleepers Tomb) is a Dragon that was conceived when two different colored dragons mating. This hybrid Dragon is 10 times more powerful then any dragon even more powerful then the First born. The Ring of Scales feared this and passed a law that forbid different colored dragons from breeding. Something that Vox and Naggy have no wish to follow. We are still not sure if they really do love each other or only wish to destroy the Ring of Scales with their Offspring. Sooo. In short Vox shouldn't, couldn't and most not leave her lair. I know a number of people in the raid that petitioned it. I'm guessing the GM/Guide showed up to see if Vox was in fact out of her lair (at that point she wasn't)<br>
<br>
As for helping. I was there for most of the Raid to start with helping where I can. I was ones like you, learning to do large targets with the CoG and With the guild I was in before Harbingers we helped run many of the CoG events, I would like to help others that where like me to enjoy and experience Raids like this. So I come to help. I clear Giants when your buffing and sadly I come because there is always a chance that the CoG may have need for a rogue to help CR. Like last night. I'm only glad to help where I can.<br>
In the case of last night when the Giants popped and Vox rampaged over the buffline I know that my help wasn't good enough and I called in the guild for help. I'm Grateful they came (not that I had any doubt they wouldn't) I'm so happy I got all the corpses out of the Pits and almost all the corpses out of the Lair before the Giants Popped or I would have needed to get a lot more coffins. <br>
<br>
Right Rant time.<br>
<br>
1)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I'm not going to pull your corpse because you have to camp. I pull up to 50+ corpses at one time. I pull the closest corpses I have Consent for. If yours is close to the rock, great. If it's on the other side of the room you're going to have to wait.<br>
2)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I'm pulling 50+ corpses I can't stop and chitchat. If you send me a tell there is a 98% you will not get a reply.<br>
3)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is something that bugs me to no end. I shouldn't have to stand under Vox asking 30 people for consent. I can't blame the meleer's for this because they aren't in the zone. But I can blame the Casters that are in the zone for not telling their groups. I can blame Group leaders for not keeping a good record of their groups and can relay information on the status of their corpses or members. I couldn't believe it when we Aggroed Vox in order to get the corpses out of the back of the lair there where 5 people I didn't have consent from. If Vox didn't escape and everything want fine I would have had to do the whole thing again. Again increasing the chances that Vox gets out and kills everyone.<br>
4)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Please listen to me. When I say do not do something don't. Last night I was very close to stopping CR because people weren't listening. Yes it's great when you see your corpse and 40 others bouncing down the hall towards you, that doesn't mean you run up to loot, pull it or rez. You sit back and you wait for me to get there. I have people running up the ramp. Only needed one to get aggro and everything would go to hell in a hand basket (second wipe out case in point) <br>
5)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It didn't happen this time, with is good. Don't go into the lair when I'm in there. In fact unless your charging Vox stay out. If she aggros she Banishs me. Being banished takes a lot of time out of CR and increase your changes of Vox coming out and playing.<br>
6)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not Rant to do with me But still CR related.  Do not ask the Nercos to summon corpses because you can't find your corpse. As far as you know they could be under the Orge corpse 2 feet to your left. I heard of 2 coffins being wasted like that last night. Getting your corpse summoned should be a last result unless you're willing to pay for the Coffins.<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
Oh a good note.<br>
There was only 6 corpses in the pits. 1 was under a pit it shouldn't be (AKA ran the wrong way) The other 5 where most likely feared in. That's a really good number.<br>
<br>
Second good number (I guess) I got all the corpses out of the Lair except for 5. And those where Summoned out by the Harbinger necromancer Rebthik. (Great work Bro) The cost of the coffins came out of the CoG raid funds in an odd turn around of luck. The last Vox raid I was on with CoG I got 300pp for Reagents but forget to turn it in. The coffins roughly costed around 300pp. So no need to pay me back or anything like that. It's all even and equal.<br>
<br>
Last number. After amazing rezing by Marley, Ilyena, and 3 other clerics I can't remember the name off (Sorry) everyone, to the best of my knowledge only 3 people don't get all their corpses rezed. These 3 people camped early. I only hoped that they got all their corpses today and Rezed. <br>
<br>
Failed Raids happen. If they didn't victories wouldn't be as sweet. There is no one to blame for how it want wrong. Everyone did a great job just some back things happened. And next time they will not. Hope that I can make the next dragon raid and this time watch the random spam. &lt;Smile&gt;<br>
