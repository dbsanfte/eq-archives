<br>
My name is Ghesta Icepaw, and I am a relative newcomer to these boards.  I think I may have been here a few times before, but never with an actual rant.<br>
<br>
I am a level 49 druid, and an officer in the guild of &lt;Heroes&gt;.  Those that know of our guild know that we strive for honor and truth above the more base aspects of the game.  Those who know ME personally know that I hold such things very dear to me.  I try to be honorable and truthfull in ALL my dealings.  For I feel that your reputation is more valuable than any loot or experience in the game.<br>
<br>
That being said, I also know Rushlite and Egan of Veil of Shadows... and while I have not seen either of them in many many moons, know them to be honorable people as well.<br>
<br>
Thats why I was so enraged to learn that they were in the same guild as the complete jackass named Aaadan.  What follows is a story about him.<br>
<br>
This Aaadan is a disrepectfull camp stealer, and deserves to be punished by his guild.  He blatently decided to steal my camp after he said he wasn't camping it, TWICE.<br>
<br>
I have, and will post my logs of the event shortly.<br>
<br>
I expect that the leadership of VoS take this matter gravely, for Aaadan has not only won the disrespect of me, but also of several of my guildmates for his dishonorable actions.<br>
<br>
On a further note, if my memory serves me correctly... Aaadan was once a member of Heroes, and was booted out for his behavour.  Perhalps thats not the exact way it happened, maybe, asked to leave would be more appropriate, but im not sure on that fact, it was a while ago.<br>
<br>
These are my logs... They were edited to remove extranious things like ooc, shout, and auction that have no relevance to the situation.<br>
<br>
please note a few things.<br>
1. I ask him TWICE if he is camping Hadden.<br>
2. His argument about being given the camp by Buzzen is false, as Buzzen admits that i had killed the last spawn.<br>
3. He &quot;decides&quot; he is camping hadden well over 5 minutes after he says he is not the second time.<br>
4. how he avoids answering my question about whether or not he plans on KSing me.<br>
5. that camping to fix a sound card is a pretty valid reason for logging, especialy when you have been told that the spawn is NOT camped.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
I will now let you be the judge.<br>

<br>
You can camp something, and call rights to the camp when you're not even online?<br>
<br>
Wow...I'll have to remember that, Ghesta <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned, if my kids get up from the rocking chair, and go outside to play for a bit, that chair is fair game for me. Perhaps I missed something in your story, but...I don't really find any wrong doing here. At least he was kind enough to send you the tell instead of just killing it and running.<br>
<br>
You said he was NOT there, but according to your log, he was there, right? When you logged back in? He was there talking with you. Granted, he didn't start out seeking that spawn, because someone else was camping it, but they killed it and moved on, I guess...and he was there, ready to claim the camp. You were not online.<br>
<br>
The way I look at it, if I need to camp something, then I need to be there, be ready to kill it when it spawns, (not afk or anything) and be prepared to spend a lot of time online.  If I can't, then I need to find a replacement for me while I get shut eye - or whatever.<br>
<br>
But...that's just my 2cp. /shrug<br>
<br>
I like ya, Ghesta <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But, this seems like a case of ... hmm...well, something - - Whining about camps, which just really gets my goat. Bleh. I guess maybe because I don't really camp anything.<br>

when i logged back on, he was not there, he came running up shortly after i had logged back on.<br>
<br>
Im not saying that im holding the camp from before i logged. I asked permision a second time, when he came running back up to me, and he said that he WASNT camping it.<br>
<br>
He changed his mind several minutes after I had cleared it with him that he WASNT camping it.<br>
<br>

Finally, tona, we should hook up again ingame sometime... we always had fun grouping didn't we ? <p><BR>

<br>
Camp crap. I think it sucks, which is why I rarely camp anything. If I happen to get a group going somewhere that the potential for me to get a specific item is, then woot....that's great. But, I tend to stray away from that type of situation, Ghesta, for that very reason.  <br>
<br>
It just gives me a damn headache. <p><BR>

OK that is a real butt-headed thing to say. Well I guess that he is allowed to be an ass because it's just a game. Another person lost on the idea that his poor actions in game = being a jackass in RL. Well dude, if it's JUST A GAME then friggin quit and go play by yourself and leave the rest of us alone. <br>
<br>
About the camp, you have a tough situation. I have given up a camp that I started after the original camper came back from LD or whatever and asked me too. But that's just me. People have a hard time respecting camps when you are sitting right on the spawn point let alone coming back from LD or something.<br>

What would you have done if Aaadan was gone and another druid was at the camp when you logged back on?  Would you have asked the druid to leave?<br>

It was fair game for anyone.<br>
<br>
Even if you were afk sitting there, and he had spawned.  Someone tried to get a hold of you for a reasonable period of time and decided to kill it.  I would say I would be bummed but, if your not there to state your claim, you can't expect people to assume your camping it.  I don't consider the afk message a reasonable way to communicate your intentions either...<br>

<br>
1. You told him before that you were logging for a bit, and that you had Hadden on timer, and that you were coming back. He acknowledged this. <br>
<br>
2. When you came back, you said you were camping hadden. He acknowledged this.<br>
<br>
3. You ASKED him if he was camping Hadden, he acknowledged you and said no. The camp was yours.<br>
<br>
The fact that you went offline means nothing in my mind, because you'd asked him if he was camping Hadden and he said no, and this was after you'd logged back on. THE he decided that since the GBS was camped he'd take Hadden instead. Wtf? He wasn't even there for Hadden. That was a dick move. I try to be honorable, help people, and do what's right too, but I wouldn't have budged and inch for him.<br>
<br>
For me, this is the kicker:<br>
