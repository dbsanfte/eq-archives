I am an enchanter and am quite fed up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  with the whole jewel craft aspect of EQ.  Particularly with the fact that since the introduction of the bazaar, you can not make money for jewlery made.  Player made jewlery sells for many times below the average cost that it sold for in EC.  <br>
<br>
I understand that the idea of supply and demand has a profound impact on this tradeskill.  I think what we enchanters of Norrath need to do is to form a jewlery  OPEC if you will <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and artificially control prices for player made jewlery.  This can only be accomplished if the maojority of jewel crafters and specifically enchanters band together and say no to allowing our jewlery and our skills to be sold at underrated prices.  <br>
<br>
Frankly, I have invested too much in jewel craft not to see some form of positive results.  I have invested thousands of plat and hundreds of man hours into developing my skill.  I think that i should be able to get some sort of compensation for it.<br>
<br>
What I am sugesting is a conglomeration made up of the enchanters of Norath to help set fair, I repeat fair, prrices for player made jewelery.  I am not out to gouge anyone because I feel that peoples plat should be worth something and not trivialized due to the time that people spend in gathering that plat.  I propose that this conglomeration would not only benefit jewlers but would also benefit other player because it would give real value to the jewelery they spent their hard earned plat on.<br>
<br>
I am not here to try to make plat off anyone in an unethical manor in any way.  I just feel that i should be compensated in some way for the fact that i chose to aquire this discipline.  I dont begrudge other tradeskillers from making money on their ttradeskills and apparently there are tradeskills out there that are making really good money.  <br>
<br>
The first thing i think we should do is put together a list of the enchanters on the rathe that are interested in this idea and see what the response is.  Then we could put together a panel to determine what fair compensation would be for the made items.  Then we could see where things go from there.  <br>
<br>
<br>
So post up and let me know what the rest of you chanter slingers think.  <br>

These items often far surpass those that we can create and are so numerous that the prices get driven down. This means that someone faced with buying a crafted item or a dropped item will more often than not take the dropped item.<br>
<br>
Nice idea but I don't really see it working because of the wide selection of other items that a player can chose to equip instead.<br>
<br>
What we really need to see is a stat increase for what we make and that would once again make it a viable tradeskill.<br>

Verant needs to do something about all the crafts and make it so that the utility of tradeskills is increased for the enjoyment of players who take the time to get the mastery down.  This would only add to the content of the game instead of keeping it the hack and slash norm that drove many of my freinds to DAoC or away from D&amp;D till the advent of the 3rd addition.  <br>

<br>
As to a commitee, like the one you stated, I believe that it won't have much power in terms of controlling prices. In fact, I know it won't work, because just look at US economy. The primary controlller is supply and demand, something that a commitee or a company has no control over. The only thing to do, that will work, is to get people interested in buying the items, and how do we do that? By lowering prices. Lose/Lose situation, the way I see it. I could be wrong though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

There are many items I no longer make because of cost and time involved to make the items are no longer worth the price they can be sold for. Though some is from other jewelry sellers, most is from people who are upgrading the items and just dropping the old items for prices below cost.  <br>
<br>
The system you propose will not work because it would require almost 100% participation, which you will never have. I already talk to others selling items in the bazaar where price cutting of each other has been involved. There have been times of severe price cutting, where I finally talk to the people and say lets both agree to a fair price instead of trying to drive each other out of business. So far all I have talked to have been agreeable and we both start to make money again instead of loose it trying to undercut the other guy.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coronus@therathetravelagency>Coronus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/25/03 11:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tradeskills, To profit or not to profit</span><hr size=1> That is essentially what i am trying to say.

It's simple (and very inexpensive) to grandmaster JC compared to other tradeskills (tailoring, smithing).<br>
<br>
If you've taken the time to max JC, you may consider planar jewelry.  Your more likely to get suitable return on investment there.<br>
<br>
I maxed JC long ago, but the only thing I tend to use it for is equiping guildies with resist gear.  I don't spend a lot of time in the bazaar, but I would guess that you'd be better off making enchanted mana vials (of various types) and enchanted metals and putting those up for sale, rather than jewelry.<br>
<br>
Of course, now that I've gone and said that, the enchanted items market will probably hit the floor, as well. <p><BR><I><font face="John Handy LET" color="#FFFF00" size="3"><B>Shantar</B></FONT></I><BR>
