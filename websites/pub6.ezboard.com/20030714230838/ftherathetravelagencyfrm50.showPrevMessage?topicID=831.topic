<br>
Your legs churn the ground, finding inexplicably solid purchase against the myriad pine needles and dying moss on the forest floor. You have been running like this, through the densest woods and inhospitable terrain for six days. You are pursued, the run away servitor elf of the noble house Lytharr. There is no escape from the bondage, and your lord’s minions will not rest until they capture you and return with you to the spires of Eth’Inare. Nor rest will you find, yourself, until you elude or are killed by those who prey upon you. <br>
<br>
Your footfalls break noisily against the drying leaves, the cloying smells of the nearly beginning autumn overpowering you. You may have been born to the slavery of the servitor class, but the human bloodline that your ‘betters’ claim you possess still runs strong within your veins. Your scrabbling footfalls start a small rockslide behind you as you clamor up a steep and graveled incline. The briefest urge to glance behind you, killed dead by the impact of a black fletched arrow into the sparse grass just beside your trail. For six days and seven nights they have followed you, hounded you, though you run constantly and with the speed born of fear and years of capture. They grow closer, ever closer as even now you feel unable to continue. Your speed increases, against all laws of nature and the stresses put upon you, at the impact of yet another black fletched arrow. <br>
<br>
Daring a single glance, you spot two figures breaking from the copse of trees that you had yourself just left but moments ago. They run, but not like you. Their pace looks languid though they cover ground with greater speed than you can hope to muster in what will, no doubt, be the final moments of your chase. They wear bright white, shining in the newly dawning sun on this, your now seventh day before their swords and arrows. You know the color of your masters house well, an ebon slash upon a white background. This is not the first glance that you have seen, but the nearness frightens you into even faster motion, sprinting against the loose earth and uneven rock. Your body coils like a wound iron bar, bending with the pressure and heating rush of blood. You break into the heavily populated wood, dodging tree trunk and feeling rips form in your skin and clothing, torn by the greedy and grasping branches of the thorny bush. Blindly, you rush on, the forest ahead your only goal, as an inevitable force behind you, advances soundlessly. <br>
<br>
You take the single and only advantage that you have managed to seize upon during the entire pursuit, as you catch hold of a just low enough branch and swing up high into the turning foliage of a very welcome elm. You crouch low against the branch, as thick as your leg and sturdy, as you wait. Your ragged breath is loud, horribly loud, and you force the air in slowly, drawing deep breaths and calming your body. You rest now for the first time in nearly ten hours of solid sprinting, knowing that to stop was to die, or face recapture, both equally unappealing to you. <br>
<br>
The motion is all that makes you aware of them, for there is no sound or smell that you can catch upon the still air. They, the pair of hunters dispatched by your lord, approach with quiet grace and great speed. Their run slows to a bare walk as they draw nearer to you, below you. Their eyes affix to the ground, and they glance into the trees to their left and right. A gentle wind begins now, covering up the barest breaths you draw now. <br>
<br>
They pull back their hoods, and their pointed ears stick through their hair, their heritage worn in their features proudly, unlike you, a bastard half-breed amongst the purity of the elves. A too flat nose and too rounded ears, against the deep black of your hair and brown of your eyes, marks you well an outsider next to the pale golden hair and icy blue eyes that now scan the forest below you. The wind ever so lightly rocks the branch you have fled to, and you ride upon it as a bird would ride a current of air. As much as your human heritage works against you on the ground, you have the long years lived among the elves to thank for knowledge of the trees. <br>
<br>
A single leaf, the brownest and driest on the tree, breaks softly from the branch, and drifts downward, to land on the forest floor before the elves that pursue you. Your breath catches, and you tense as one kneels and picks up the single leaf that should not have dropped. <br>
<br>
You and he move at precisely the same time, you pushing with all your might against the trunk of the tree, propelling yourself forward along the branch, running along the ever tapering and thinning length of wood. Your last footfall slams down against the flexible branch, and you launch yourself into a leap blindly. The arrow that would have taken you in the midsection skitters harmlessly off the bark of the ancient elm. Your jump clears a small tree, and you slide downward through the collapsing branches of many pines, deposited in a shallow gully and on the run immediately upon touching the ground.<br>
 <br>
Flashes of movement to your left and right and just slightly in the edges of your peripheral vision confirm the location of your hunters, and as you burst through the final stand of trees, you realize the chase has nearly ended. Though your heart has nearly burst, you press on with all force you can muster, even as you are sure you can feel the breath on the back of your neck, the devils of the forest closely behind you. <br>
<br>
The brightest white, cut by a wide swath of black, greets your eyes, as your footsteps grind to an immediate halt in the clearing. Facing you, long features seemingly pleased to the tips of the pointed ears, is someone you never expected to see here, deep in the woods far away from the elves, but far too close. <br>
<br>
The lord’s horse. The dyed hair marred by long travel, but unmistakably your lord’s, standing before you. With a wild and momentary thought to hallucinations brought about by extreme fatigue, you swing yourself onto your old friend for the first time, and his legs pound you away from the pair who only just now have entered the clearing, and stop some twenty feet away from you, lowering their bows even as you vanish into the forest, faster than even they can follow. <br>
Finally, you sleep, trusting the rhythmic and powerful pounding hooves to see you safely to the next nightfall. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">The Hunters</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Your quarry had a full seventeen-hour head start upon you, when you began this journey. His trail at first was almost difficult to follow, even for your keen elvish eyes, narrowing to slits in the deep shadow of the forest. He had run, undoubtedly by both the age of the sign on his trail, and the cunning he repeatedly demonstrated in flight, at the earliest undetectable moment in the day, just before he was supposed to be in his quarters for the evening. You and your partner had been part of the group searching the grounds for him, when the hastily, and badly concealed path he’d run to escape, was found. <br>
<br>
Your lord commanded his return, and so it was that you made chase against this barren and useless half-breed. As his trail took you farther away from the sky touching spires of Eth’Inare, it became more broken and easily followed. Your long strides and intimate knowledge of the land let you advance with great speed and purpose, intent on the capture and return. The strength of several hundred years of hunting and overland travel began to ease back into your muscles, and from the quickened pace of the footsteps that drummed a companion beat to your own, you could tell that the sensation was not yours alone. It was good to be hunting again, after so long in the service of the court without cause for real hurry. It was good to be on the run.<br>
<br>
You had caught sight of him at dawn of the fourth day, at the crest of a far away hill. Though he ran with speed driven by the fear of death, you managed to gain nearly a half days travel on him in only three full days run. You had even stopped to eat, the once, you smiled inwardly at yourself, as you measured your strides and passed with hardly a single disturbed twig behind you. As your most esteemed sea brethren had said at court once before, ‘the shark has swallowed the spear’; once in sight of your quarry, it was only a matter of time. No trail could be lost so long as you could see the prey. <br>
<br>
Still, it was some time before the distance had been closed to a single bowshot. Though long since you’d run for nearly seven sunrises, your legs burned only gently, and your steps quickened as you could catch flashes of the half elf through the woods ahead of you. Where you deftly and quickly moved branches and bush out of your way with the staff of your bow, and back of your hand, he would plunge into the thickest branches with the sheer thrown weight of his body. The constant battery of brush and impact were wearing him down faster than the distance, and soon you were close enough to keenly see the fear in his eyes. <br>
<br>
As he drove forward with renewed speed, a grim smile broke against your teeth. Whatever his bloodline, he’d seen you finally, farther away than you would have expected, as he chanced a glance back over his shoulder. His now reckless pace was hard to match without taking on the reckless danger that he ran, unwary perhaps, or uncaring, to the potential for a single rodent hole or raised root to end this chase with a broken ankle or leg, likely a fatal break this far from any civilization or aid. <br>
<br>
You’d heard stories, long ago, of elves that grew dissatisfied with their servitude, born into and fated for it as they were, who would run, flee at any cost and any opportunity. That it was a half-breed that bolted from his rightful place did not surprise you any more than the rising of the sun behind you on the seventh day that you spent in hunting this quarry. But now, you ran with the inevitability of an end in sight. His footsteps faltered, though he did not fall or stumble, you could tell by the way the moss was broken, or the needles scattered that he forced more against loose pebble and leaf than against solid ground, expending more energy to travel less quickly. As you anticipated the next clearing to be shortly ahead, you strung your longbow as you ran, bending the nearly eight foot length of ash and polished ivory far enough to slip the tightly woven strands of giant spider silk to the point of highest tension, an incredibly well made bow.<br>
<br>
The arrows nearly leapt from the quiver to your hand, as you drew sight of the runaway elf, some two hundred yards away. The string tightened, and then bent the bow even as your pace increased. Waiting for a moment, only a moment, when your foot fell on level ground to loose the arrow, you watched the dark missile streak into the ground only feet from your target, the back of the legs. Uttering a dwarfish curse that brought a note of laughter from your hunting partner, you strung a second arrow to your bow, even as the half elf broke into yet another stand of trees. You hurried up the gravel hill, even your steady feet slipping on the loose stone slightly. <br>
Then, suddenly, all was different. All was quiet. The echoing footsteps ahead of you had ceased, and his trail vanished abruptly. His was not skill enough to suddenly become as invisible as it would appear he had, no, there must be a trace of him nearby. <br>
<br>
Even as a gentle wind rose, you could feel his presence on the air, a smell or inexplicable connection that assured you he was near. You scanned the brush for movement, any not explained by the rising wind, and listened intently, your cowls drawn back for the first time on this run, listening in all directions. <br>
<br>
A single ruddy brown leaf gently drifted down in front of you, and as you bent down to examine it, a flash of reflection glanced off the polished metal of your bracer, a figure hanging in the sturdy branches above you. <br>
<br>
Your motions never changed as you extended the examination of the fallen leaf into a fast turn and release of yet another swiftly flying arrow. The blur of motion above you was impressive, despite the hours and days of running that he’d no doubt endured badly, and he had flung himself unartfully off the branch and into a dense stand of pine. Too solid to move through, you circled widely around it, quickly so as to not allow him to escape once on the other side. You broke into the clearing, bow already on the rise and ready. <br>
The arrow, seemingly begging you to fire, stayed in its flight by the large and immeasurably fast blur of motion that you could only identify after the fact. The horse of your lordship, deep in these woods, had allowed this half-breed to ride him, the horse bred with the lineage of the fallen unicorns. The horse bred magically to permit only the birthright kings of your people to ride upon his back. <br>
<br>
You stand in the clearing for nearly an hour, staring at the empty forest, before again moving to follow the trail left by the hooves of the horse of kings. <br>

He attempts to secure food and a place to sleep, but before he is able to finish his first drink, he's press ganged into service in the human navy, as a pirate hunter. <br>
<br>
The hunters arrive in town to find their lord's horse at the stables near the inn, and are mislead into believing that their prey is upstairs,sleeping. When they secure a key from the innkeeper, the room they open is filled with sailors waiting to ambush them. They're quickly pressed into service as well, which is where the players actually are able to begin adventuring with each other. They fight several battles at sea, against pirates, before they are defeated by the pirates of the Black Asp. Despite hearing horrible rumours about the Black Asp, the captain is not an evil man, and spares the lives of any who had been pressed into service, in exchange for joining his crew. After several minor raids along the coast line of an entirely new continent (the chase aboard the navy vessel lasts several weeks at sea), a terrible and sudden storm at sea capsizes the pirate ship, and the players are tossed into the ocean. They cling to a piece of floatsam for a few days, until they wash up on shore, near a ramshackle fishing village. <br>
<br>
That's as far as I've gotten in writing it, but the village itself will stage one or two adventures, which will lead them to the next town, and river crossing, where many stories will provide the lore of the campaign. Stir in some goblins, undead, four ancient minions of good, evil and neutrality who must be brought together to combat the shattering of the 'seal of four', and bring to a boil, and that's about the shape the game will take. <br>
