I fully intend to be blunt here.<br>
<br>
  For those who dont know me I'm Timaeus Canttank, lvl 65 Enchanter formerly of Empire of the Forgotten. I'm also a tradeskill fanatic. I enjoy working tradeskilsl every bit as much as grouping/raiding. To me the idea of working another tradeskill to skill 250 mean more than getting 50 more AA's or a new robe.<br>
<br>
  Now there are many who do not enjoy tradeskills. I understand how some might not enjoy them. To work a skill to 250 takes a lot of effort farming components, time spent doing combines and subcombines and time spent aquiring the cash needed to do high end combines for the last few points.<br>
I have nothing against those who refrain from working tradeskills. To each his own. I however enjoy them and currently have 5 at skill 250, 1 at 216 and 1 at 192. I had intended to have all 7 at 250 by October 31st. This might be delayed now due to recent events.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Now because I'm more interested in tradeskills my goals tend to differ from those of others sometimes. Getting a new BP or weapon doesnt hold as much glory for me as making a new robe/weapon/brew or meal that I or others can use. I enjoy helping guildies learn tradeskills, earn money by farming tradeskill ingredients or trading gear for ingredients. Ever since PoP was released I was looking at the tradeskill items I'd someday be able to craft. Some of the items are unremarkable while others are damn nice. I started hoarding any useful ingredients back in December. Now being in EotF I didnt have access to Tier 3 zones until late spring. Yet due to people vendoring components and bazaar toons selling components I amassed a nice little stockpile over the last 10 months. Last month I had my alt Dubius craft a Robe of Eternal Fire. I'd paid somewhere between 30K and 45K over the last 10 months for the components I used to make the robe. I was thrilled that I had crafted a fine garment and the thought of selling it and making the cash back that I'd spent on the components thrilled me.<br>
<br>
  Now last month I applied to BotS. Tashim and a few others had talked me into applying. I knew they raided almost every day and that every time I logged on I'd be raiding but hell, the thought of getting new flags and a shot at crafting more items interested me greatly. I was notified of BotS policy regarding Tier 4 tradeskill drops. How if I crafted something I'd have to equip it, give it to one of my alts, give it to a guildie or donate it to the guild bank. Now if I aquire the ingredients during a group hunt or a raid I can understand that. However I had aquired the ingredients many months ago by buying them. I was told this wouldnt matter that if I joined bots and was seen selling the robe I made before entering the guild I would be kicked out of bots.<br>
<br>
  Okay now some of you probably think this is fine and acceptable. You're wrong. It's bullshit plain and simple.<br>
To expect someone to hand over an item that they crafted PRIOR to joining your guild through means of thier own and not with assistance of any guild and to refrain from selling the item simply because they think the guild deserves ALL tier 4 crafted items regardless of how you get the components is Communistic at best and Criminal at worst.<br>
<br>
  The argument I hear time and time again is this. &quot;You got access to Tier 4 through the guild so if you're not going to use the item you OWE it to the guild to give it to them&quot;.<br>
<br>
Hello...Are you really that stupid or do you think I am stupid?<br>
Remember now that I have 6 tradeskill trophies and 5 skills AT 250 so I'm obviously not stupid. I guess anyone expecting me to abide by a policy which by thier own statement doesnt apply to my Robe of Eternal Fire is Stupid.<br>
<br>
Now I have a nice little stash of tier 4 tradeskill drops in the bank. 2 10 slot bags worth. No guild gave me those items. No guild got me the flags since I dont have access to tier 4 nor have I ever been on a tier 4 raid. Yet somehow these idiots seem to think that when I DO join a tier 4 guild that those tradeskill drops in my bank, that I paid for 10 months ago, suddenly belong to them! Okay now I'm not one for bashing others for doing drugs or drinking to excess but jesus people. Are you that damn stupid to think I'll hand over items I bought 10 months ago to your guild just because you got me a flag this week?<br>
<br>
Idiots...<br>
<br>
<br>
  Now I applied to Noble Blade this week...I was open and honest about my application, my expectations and goals. Since I stated a desire to craft more tier 4 tradeskill items I was branded as someone wishing to profit by the guild's efforts. Hell people I had 230K banked last month. I own Dubius who has sold more haversacks since last November than all the other wannabe haversack makers on this server combined! Money has never been a problem for me. I bought all my spells from lvl 59-65 although I havent bought C5 of Vallons quickening yet. So I'm a greedy selfish tradeskill addict for admitting I want to craft tier 4 items...<br>
<br>
Jesus you people are idiots. I know several apps to NB who applied stating how they only want to group in a friendly environment and make new friends. This is Bullshit. I know some of these people and I know what thier goals are. Thier goals are loftier than mine. Hell I dont care if I ever see the Plane of Time. That doesnt interest me. Tradeskills do. I love crafting items. I crafted more items for eotf, got 20+ eotf members thier solstice earrings, donated over 100K to the guild in items, cash, spells etc and when I demanded we put more effort towards getting tier 3 pop flags I was branded selfish. SO I left eotf and shortly thereafter about 12 others did as well. Many joined other guilds. NB, VoF, Sote, Bots etc...<br>
<br>
Do these people have goals? Do they want better gear? Do they want more flags? More AA's? Hell now! THey just want friendly environment with friends to group/raid in...<br>
<br>
<br>
...um...wasnt that exactly what they had in EoTF without the new gear, flags, zones etc? Yes it was <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But you all swallowed the lie and smiled. Yet when I was open and honest and only asked for new flags and the ability to craft tier 4 items, and I never said anything about selling anything I made, you all branded me as selfish and arrogant.<br>
<br>
Thank you for not accepting my application. I'd hate to think that I almost joined a guild of idiots who believe any lie they see in black and white. Btw I could lie also but then I'd just be another toon and not myself<br>
<br>
Timaeus Canttank<br>
65th Enchanter<br>
aka Dubius Bynature<br>
46th Halfling and maker of Haversacks.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. Since 99% of you seem to think I'm selfish and greedy, even though you're wrong, I'm going to retalliate. I know everyone knows someone who makes these things and I'm jsut some stupid greedy jerk who is too arrogant for his own good. Or so you think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
AS OF THIS DAY I WILL NO LONGER CRAFT HAVERSACKS. I have 2 friends in EQ who have never wavered and have always been there for me. They dont always agree with me but thier contrary opinions help to guide me at times, when I am wrong. It does happen.<br>
<br>
Vylant and Faranshade will be the only ones who can, and rarely will, receive a haversack. Everyone else on this server from this day forward can craft thier own! Selfish? Arrogant?<br>
<br>
Well now I am going to live up to your expectations <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Find your own damn bags from now on!<br>

There loss, I'm sure there is a guild out there that will value your contributions.  As far as the sack things go, keep in mind who you are 'punishing' with this strategy, the members of guilds in tier 4 planes who make these policy, or the ones who actually need the bags.  <br>

What we get on raids is strictly for guild funds not for personal gain. Of course we spend quite a bit of cash on raids and you being the greedy person you are think that your horde is more important than the guild as a whole since you labored and got those skills. <br>
<br>
Our guild doesnt cater to recruits ever. You didnt like it you left, oh well your loss. We have tradeskillers in the guild more than willing to help the guild instead of themselves and understand our policies. Our guild isnt about making someone rich in plat, its about killing high end mobs and seeing the end game. You obviously wouldnt have fit in for that anyways as Time doesnt drop any tradeskill items. <br>
<br>
Now i dont remember you so you must not have been an app for very long, I mean I am one of the recruiters also so I would think I would remember you if you had tried for any amount of time. But you probably quit as soon as you heard you couldnt make a killing off us for your ebay/selling and quit. Thats fine you did us a favor of having to cut you instead and I thank you for that. <br>
<br>
Now ill give you some friendly advice. If you are going to apply to a guild, especially a high end guild I would suggest you cater to their rules instead of thinking they will change them for you. After all you are just a recruit trying to prove yourself, not in a position of power where they are trying to prove themselves to you.

We have 100-some people that all contribute items they got in XP groups and even soloing for the benefit of our guild.

If you want to have a guild flag you and get you into the zones so you can be the mostest uberestest tradeskiller ever then you have to abide by their rules to do so. Otherwise keep selling your stuff and buying components on your own. Guilds don't flag for the elementals and above for you to be a solo act. They do it for the guild as a whole to move forward. If it is the guilds policy then it is the guilds policy. Don't like it don't try to join.<br>

What you seem to be missing here is the fact that these people are all in a guild such as ours with the mindset of advancing the guild as a whole.  Yer intentions are for advancing yerself, as is apparent in yer post and attitude.<br>

Given there are only 4 elemental guilds ATM and they all have posted here caling you the fucktard that you are, it don't look like yer gona be getting access to elementals anytime soon.  I know a few guilds that are comming close to the elementals, I'll make sure to troll around their recruting boards and link this thread and your app(to NB) to any 'app' ya might feel ya wana post on another guilds site.

Hey to get that earring, w/o elemental access, you need someone to MQ the hope stone, with this attitude, i don't think anyone will help ya on that one.. and if someone is stupid enough to do it... god help them from our wrath.<br>

So just shut your fucking mouth about it and make them w/o telling anyone and do what you like with the items.  How do you think you got the items required to make the robe w/o elemental access anyways?  Because of people selling the item pieces beind their guild's back in the bazaar.<br>
