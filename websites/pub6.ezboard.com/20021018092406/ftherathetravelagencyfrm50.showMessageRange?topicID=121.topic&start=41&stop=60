<br>
For future reference, ignorance is the lack of knowledge, whether by omission or by lack of education on the subject.  I am ignorant of the laws of Zimbabwe concerning the sale of livestock, for instance.  Stupidity is the inability to retain knowledge or learn.  A stupid person will never be able to understand quantum physics, for example, regardless of the amount of effort put forth by other people to teach that person (and no, I'm not saying the converse, that if you can't understand quantum physics that you are stupid).  People get those mixed up a lot.<br>
<br>
I, however, have logging turned on permenantly so I can remember stuff...<br>
<br>
Kergin was the one who requested the name change on the rotation from Dozekar to one that reflected Dozekar and the named mobs.<br>
<br>
And this is the quote from my log from Karadin:<br>

Please accept my apologies if you think I was calling anyone a liar, that was not my intention at all.  I don't word things very well sometimes, but after reading it I can see. <br>
<br>
I think after reading Gromms Points and Thaldin, I guess it was just a clarity issue where the agreement was only known to the ones on the rotation.  It was just that when guilds got bigger they didn't know cause nothing was posted.  So really can't really blame anyone.  <br>
<br>
I do worry though, cause as guilds get bigger, will we run into this again?  What named Mobs are guilds gonna have to check on to find out if they are part of a rotation?   <p><center><image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif><b><i>"Big Bad Bonedaddy"</i></b><image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif><BR>

Gromm, its as simple as this, you defining words for us is senseless, had these rules been posted this would never have happened, had these rules not been posted recently it would have happened again.

There were no guidelines specified publicly about Doze and the Named Drakes and I don't want the members, guild leader or officers of SoY viewed as not comprehending said guidelines. It's a little different from the &quot;I didn't see the stop sign&quot; theory. We know there are stop signs from the guidelines presented to you in the manual you get at the DMV. Looking for the stop signs is up to you.<br>
<br>
We looked for the guidelines about the written Rotations (as of yesterday being Doze and NToV and not Doze and named) and there were none about the named drakes. Doesn't mean we don't comprehend or adhere to Rathe Rotation mob policies.<br>

This has been known.  I have no objection to these being on a single rotation.  <br>
<br>
However I do have a problem with the named drakes being left up for days.  most of the named drakes are in the south and east portions of HOT.  Pulling from those areas is difficult to impossible in some areas without pulling getting a named.  Doing FD splits on every pull to split off a named is time consuming to say the least.   When Dozekar has been dead for 3 days and there are named up there is a major problem going on.  Guild up for Dozekar need to be monitoring HOT for the named, and kill within 24 hour spawn time in my opinion.  To do otherwise will cause the problems seen here of guilds killing them, out of frustration of trying to get to the non-named npcs. <p><a href="http://www.yopolis.com/syndicate" target="_blank">

<br>
&quot; Its like saying dont kill the golems in Fear anymore cause they are now on the Cazic Rotation. Well that just screwed the people who have been able to kill the golems and not CT. &quot;<br>
<br>
This wouldn't happen.. why? Because the golems' loot isn't directly linked to CT's loot. The drakes DROP NOTHING but the symbols that must be included with Dozekar tears. I am not even sure they have a chance to drop armor, but they might.<br>
<br>
If you're not on the Doze rotation and killing named drakes, you're one of the following generalizations: a) no idea that they're linked to Dozekar in any meaningful way, b) Know exactly what they drop and kill them to hoard symbols till the day you can kill dozekar, c) kill them because you kill dozekar too.<br>
<br>
Choice A happens.. and I don't think that's the issue.  I think B is the issue because  guilds on the Doz rot feel that they're being taken advantage of by guilds soon to be on the Doz rot who are planning ahead.<br>
<br>
If you KNOW what these named have, and you're killing them without being able to kill Doze.. then you're directly crapping on the spirit of the rotations in general.<br>
<br>
As for the other part, KIC did kill the named a few times before they killed Doze.. but once KIC realized the impact it had, they stopped.<br>
<br>
Most of the guilds capable of HoT/planning on killing Doze are NOW aware of the impact (if they weren't before, and doing it anyway).  It will be interesting to see if the drakes stay alive or people still kill them out of rotation or out of turn.<br>

<br>
As an aside, since then, we've been hunting HoT almost every weekend, and I don't think we've even seen one of the named drakes up. We have found Dozekar up a few times, though. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I could care less about the Dozekar rotation...if the named drakes are part of it, works for me. I'm just a poor cleric who's tired of having to res my guildmates because of would-be Dozekar slayers pushing through HoT (and then training us while they CR) when we were there first. You have 24 hours to kill Dozekar...we only do HoT for a few hours a week. Is a little respect for the camp really that much to ask?<br>

As far as the named Drakes that are tied to the Doze drop quests, I don't agree with this due to what Vorth stated.  It adds additional time to have to split mobs from the nameds.  If Doze and all the named Drakes were in an area where they don't get in the way of other pulls then I could see Doze and the named Drakes as a package deal scenario viable.  But as it stands the named drakes are pretty spread out throughout HoT.  Also should all quest that are linked be reserved as a &quot;package&quot;?<br>
<br>
Issue 2:<br>
I wasn't even going to make a statement about this but it ties in with Doze rotaion.<br>
<br>
What is the proper ettiquette for killing Doz if a guild is already at the entrance to HoT door?  I understand there are time constraints as to how long a rotation mob is up before he is auto-passed and can sympathize with that but does that give any guild on Doze rotation the right to run over another guild that has the entrance to HoT camped.<br>
<br>
Let me say El'lar Dobluth is not a guild with the raw massive numbers of Tindi or NB nor do we have the skill set and damage of BotS in small numbers so we choose to do the entrance to HoT rather then go deeper in.  We have moved deeper in but it resulted in several wipes and long CRs.<br>
<br>
I have never had any issues with VoLS nor LoL and really don't now even thos the following events transpired so this is not a rant about either guild but more of seeking clarification on ettiquette.<br>
<br>
As previously posted on the day mentioned earlier in this thread, El'lar were first at the entrance to HoT and it was by common standard on the Rathe, camped.  VoLS wanted to attempt Doze and after we cleared the front mobs and side mobs, we as a courtesy allowed them to move through us and attempt Doze.  We were there at 11:00 AM EST and by the time VoLS had finished with the attempt and CR (VoLS almost won but failed) which  we assisted in it was around 1:00 PM.  <br>
<br>
Our help to VoLS resulted in a VoLS shammy (Halimar? whom we rezzed) dragging his or someone elses corpse close to HoT door and causing us to have to evac and some members to die. Why would our members get aggro you ask?  AE mana song is your answer.<br>
<br>
During the time VoLS was attempting Doze, LoL was assembling and waiting to see if VoLS would kill Doze.  Doomas who is a civil guy asked in /ooc if someone was killing Doze and they were told VoLS was attempting him as we waited out of HoT so they could attempt Doze in the Pit area.  We /ooc'd HoT entrance was camped and ED was waiting for VoLs to finish their CR.  Doomas then /ooc'd ED would have to wait again because LoL was moving in to kill Doze to which my response in /ooc ED would not wait again since we had been waiting for a camp that we had rights to by being there first and allowed VoLS to move through us.  At this point Doomas gave me a tell asking politely if LoL could do Doze and I told him no due to the long wait my guild had endured already and that my guildies and myself had real life time invested just ticking away although we were there first.  <br>
<br>
Again we allowed VoLS to move through us as a courtesy to them and did not pull mobs to not interfere in their attempt.  I thought was over from here due to no more tells from Doomas and that LoL would wait until we finished our raid.<br>
<br>
Later Darkveinn of LoL asked nicely if they could do Doze and we said no due to delaying our own raid for 3 hours now as VoLS attempted Doze and the ensuing CR.  We moved in to HoT again and rezzed our dead from the VoLS induced dr'aggro.  Then again assisted in VoLS CR which resulted in a roamer aggro due to one of VoLS clerics getting too close to the pit, aggroing a roamer and resulted more deaths and evacs.  LoL also was talking to Warrik (I assume) and also helped CR VoLS.<br>
<br>
Then I was given a tell by Brotor and old friend that LOL will be moving in to kill Doze. It was not a request but a statement that they would move thorugh regardless if we had HoT entrance camped or not.  I knew this was not Brotor by his manner of speech to me and asked who it was.  Darkveinn said it was he (Darkveinn) who was playing Brotor now.  He became irate and demanded to be allowed to move through and threatened never to help us with CR and laughed at how we had mobs gate on us and became generally pissy because LoL had 24 hours to kill him and they were on the 20th hour.  I simply told him it is not El'lar's fault LoL did not get to HoT before us and I received more of don't expect LoL to bail you out on CRs, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
To make a long story longer, morale was down due to all the wasted time and our own members dieing due to VoLS CR.  I decided it would be better to just let LoL kill Doze than risking a huge guild pissing contest and more deaths.  At this announcement to my guild, we lost several people at the raid due to frustration and not wanting to wait further.  <br>
<br>
Darkveinn was vey happy and upbeat when I told him LoL could do Doze.  So LoL was allowed to move through us and kill Doze with one the stipulation.  They would get one attempt and if they failed, they would sumon corpses rather then CR to entrance of HoT.  Darkveinn (playing Brotor) agreed and they went about killing him and he was thankful.  A pair of plate gloves dropped as they cleared around Doze area and I was given tell to loot them so I could MQ it for one of our guildies.  LoL killed Doze and there was much rejoicing on both sides.<br>
<br>
Now we thought finally, we can start our raid.  It was around 3:30 PM EST, 4.5 hours before we had HoT camped and then I get a request from VoLS if they could move through us again and pull mobs to Doze room.  To which I agreed and since Doze was killed and LoL were rezzing there dead in Doze room.  I told VoLS to move in and I don't know what happened but VoLS went to Doze room and brought some mobs I guess which resulted in some LOL people dieing as told to me by Darkveinn (playing Brotor).  I don't know what took place as far as mobs getting into Doze room so can't really say more than that.<br>
<br>
Well after LOL was done and VoLS was in Doze room, I started pulling for our raid but sadly we had lost too many people and mobs kept gating so I ended the raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
SO IF YOU DIDN'T CARE TO READ THRHOUGH THAT NOVEL, ANSWER THIS GUYS:<br>
<br>
My point in all this is why should any guild, that has HoT camped, be forced to wait for the Doze rotation guild to kill Doze?  Again, I am not trying to slam VoLS or LoL but I think some of you can see how our raid was disrupted.  I think if you were in my shoes, you could understand the frustration on that day.<br>

  I've read this entire thread, several times over actually, and many have had valid points on both sides of the issue. It seems although we have yet to come to a consensus with respect to the Dozekar issue, we all seem to be leaning towards the general consensus that the issue is made more complex by the &quot;Dozekar incapable yet named capable&quot; guilds involved and that more thought is required to solve this issue. I'm glad to see that this is being addressed. <br>
<br>
  What hasn't yet been addressed directly and frankly is the real reason behind why the Dozekar capable guilds want the named to be on the same rotation, at least not comprehensively. The reason is loot, simply put. The &quot;Dozekar capable&quot; guilds seem to have found the quest items from the Named elusive, more so than the Dozekar quest items. So having the named up each time they do Doze is very convenient. Yet, the &quot;Dozekar incapable&quot; guilds would sure like to get a head start collecting those elusive quest items prior to getting themselves on the Dozekar rotation so that when they are capable of doing Dozekar each kill very well may represent another completed quest. I don't blame them for this either. But here is a question for you. If the Named mobs involved in the quests were not in the same zone (as is the case with many quests), would they still be considered on the same rotation? If Cazic Thule and say, Wuoshi dropped two items for the same quest would they reside on the same rotation? Or would Wuoshi remain a rotationless mob? (Silly example but you get my meaning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
  Another question, unrelated to Dozekar but still having the general spirit of the discussion here. Should a guild not be allowed to farm PoF if they are incapable of killing Cazic Thule himself? No? Then why can they not farm NToV without killing the boss mob there? Why is it such a sin to enjoy the available content in partial form, the part you are currently capable of? Because the rotation guilds do not benefit from it? Well, of course that's the reason. Do I necessarily disagree? Hmm, perhaps you should ask when I am on that rotation....  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  Don't get me wrong. I recognize fully that the &quot;lesser&quot; guilds benefit greatly from these rotations as well, perhaps more than the current rotation guilds. I for one would hate to be racing &quot;uber&quot; guilds to many of the mobs I am capable of killing now. But at the same time I am being denied content I am now currently capable of for fear of being steamrolled lest I adhere to our current rotational rules.<br>
<br>
  Somehow, it still leaves me dissatisfied.<br>
<br>
  Please be aware that my comments here in no way imply that they are necessarily representative of my guild as a whole.<br>

<br>
The unwritten rule of the Doze rotation as established by the rotation founders were that named + doze are a package. That's fine, and worked well at that time, especially since 'random spawn timers' werent in place at that time.<br>
<br>
Now there are 5 or so guilds on this rotation, and the named spawn at all times. What if the 3 others ALL would prefer the drakes to be FFA instead?  Does the majority rule in this case? How would this be handled?<br>

The Etiquette(sp?) forum is still pretty new and we are still trying to get all the information into that should be there.  Emil's post will be moved there, so this information is availble to all.<br>
<br>
The bigger guilds are used to having to talk to each other, we do it on a daily basis.  You newer (newer meaning newer to these rotations) are not used to doing this, so we are trying to get the information out there for everyone.<br>
<br>
Should we have done this sooner?  Yes.  But we're human too, we do make mistakes.  We are now trying to correct that, and have the information out there for all.<br>
<br>
Gromm, we should get a post up about Glyphed/Exiled for general info too. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uemilsinclair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 315<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 7:17:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A few months ago...</span><hr size=1> Jurrasic Epoch said:<br>

<br>
-- This would bring up a case of 'using the rotations to your advantage, while at the same time, ignoring the rotations to your advantage'  It is unacceptable, and has come up now and again thru our history.  If you do not wish to follow established rotations, for your own good (read: banking drakes until you can kill doz) then the 'rotation machine' will not be abliged to protect your other mobs you have safely reserved for you, whatever mobs they may be.<br>
<br>
in a nutshell, you cant sit on the fence, regarding the rotational system.<br>
<br>
and ill restate whats been said 1000 times above:<br>
<br>
- dozekar: ~7 day pop, drops 1/2 the items for the CoV quests<br>
- drakes: ~ day pop, drops other half of the items for the CoV quests.<br>
<br>
---if you kill drakes, and can't kill doz, you are (a) oblivious to what they are for/how they are handled (forgivable) (b) self serving, and planning for the CoV quests, looking to gain a head start.<br>
<br>
There is really no other alternative.  If you are planning for Doz/CoV quests, then you are 'sitting on the fence' as it has been clearly (and rationally i think) explained why these 2 entities (doz+drakes) are treated as a single package.<br>
<br>
Please, trust me - when you enter the doz rot you will highly, endlessly appreciate the drakes protected for YOU, when you are up.<br>
<br>
--edit:<br>
<br>
to directly adress jurassic's question:  This still applies to the 'sitting on the fence' analogy -<br>
<br>
&quot;I want a mob(s) ffa when it serves me, but damn right, i still want statue of rz, tormax, zlan, etc.. to be protected by a rotation for ME!!!&quot;  its principles, you are either pro FFA, or pro-share/rot.  It is impossible (ethically i suppose) to pick and choose how you want to act, as it serves you.<br>

<br>
Killing the drakes yields NO loot except quest items.<br>
<br>
I think only one quest requires 4 Tears from Dozekar where all the rest require a combination there of.<br>
<br>
Logically, to make Dozekar worth while to kill, you need to kill the named drakes along with him, hence how it was decided it was a package deal.  Even after the advent of the random spawn timers (Blah), the guilds on the rotation were able to keep it as a package deal for the most part.<br>
<br>
There was an occasional accidental killing from time to time of the named drakes by HOT farming guilds, but it was worked out.  To keep all this intact isn't that difficult, it's just asking the people that are there to be a little more careful.<br>
<br>
I know the pull routes inside the HoT like the back of my hand...I should after all this time, and I can say for a fact, you can farm the left side of the Dozekar room (facing in from the door) without ever touching a named Drake.  They all spawn behind and to the right of the room.  Unless you fight to the exit, you can avoid ever killing the named drakes this way. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthaldin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thaldin</A> at: 9/16/02 3:27:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujurrasicepoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 474<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 7:41:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> Thank you for replying Emil, but I don't believe that it DOES answer my question.<br>
<br>
Though the named and Dozekar ARE linked in that the two 'parts' from each complete the quests, they are NOT the same mob.  <br>
<br>
While the initial founders of the rotation decided to make them a package deal, it does not have to be this way. <br>
<br>
Otherwise you could make the claim that all VP medallion mobs and ground spawns are part of the Trakanon rotation and must never be killed by non Trakanon guilds or rot guilds not currently up for Trakanon.<br>
<br>
The question was IF the majority of Dozekar rotation guilds didn't care to check HoT every day for their named to spawn and decided that it was just as easy to 'take em when you want em' (and there have been times that Doze is killed multiple times before the named are touched) does the majority rule in this decision to remove the named from the rotation? why or why not?<br>
<br>
Again please keep in mind that this is hypothetical, and FK as a Dozekar rotation guild makes no position for or against a change at this time, but it should be hashed out as I have a funny feeling that this sort of issue may well come up in the future with 'linked' mobs in PoP, as well as with Doze now.<br>

<br>
Verant screwed up BADLY when they put the drakes on such a random spawn timer.  The drakes will be in the way of guilds pulling for armor, and rotation guilds will have difficulty waiting until the drakes are fully spawned to clear them.  The drake symbols -are- the bottleneck in all of the most desirable Dozekar quests, the drop rates are horrible, and you can typically farm enough tears to complete 4 quests before you can get the symbols to complete one. <br>
<br>
Verant should put these drakes on a three-day spawn timer and then we can -could- just call the drakes FFA and be done with it (Although you guilds who still need Skyshrine armor might not realize what a nightmare that would be to your farming attempts when you add NB/Tindi and BOTS to your competition for HOT).  Verant hasn't done this however, so we must make do as best we can.<br>
<br>
Now, to speak against my fellows...  BOTS, Tindi and NB: Get off your asses.  If you want to be on the Dozekar rotationt then be prepared to accept the responsibility for the nightmare of that rotation.  Dozekar needs to be a TOP priority.  On spawn day, you guys need to be sitting there waiting to catch drakes.  That's simply what it takes to be responsible for the other guilds who need to farm the armor that comes out of there.<br>
<br>
I speak against BOTS here, because they're ahead of us in the rotation and that's just the guild I see, but too often BOTS will be busy doing more important things and pass Doze/named late in the day after the drakes have already been robbed.  The rotation passes to Noble Blade and we see that we've been passed Doze and one or two of the eight drakes, and of course we pass rather than 'waste' our turn on a worthless doze kill (We don't really need many tears) and one chance at a symbol rather than eight.<br>
<br>
This is why the stuff gets left up so long.  If you're on the rotation, make it a priority on the level with your VT farming or whatever your doing at the moment.  Take responsibility for a difficult rotation, and don't leave the stuff up to be stolen and then pass the buck.<br>
