I can not be the only poor S.O.B. that got the end of the shit stick.<br>
<br>
I ask you this, &quot;How the hell can a contractor, licensed in the state of California, walk off a job.  Have it fail inspection and not get his license taken away?&quot;<br>
<br>
I filed a claim against his bond, lodged a complaint with the California State License Board (CSLB) and have gone to arbitration.<br>
<br>
It has been just over a year and I just received a judgment in my favor via the mail.  Well you would think, &quot;Good news.&quot;  But the repairs to my home cost in excess of $6,000.00.  Work that was stipulated in the contract.  Work that the contractor refused to do.  All of this was presented to the arbitrator in the form of letters, pictures, expert testimony etc.<br>
<br>
When you know you are in the right and you get fucked it really rubs.  I have a contract, in writing.  Signatures, witnesses, expert testimony and a written report from the CSLB stating all the deficiencies.  Basically all fingers pointing at the contractor.<br>
<br>
So here I am thinking I will be getting a letter, a judgment in my favor.  Only to open the letter and see I have been awarded $1430.13.  I am pleased I will be getting something, if the contractor pays.  You see the contractor has up to a year to pay me before his license is revoked.  WTF is wrong with our system?<br>
<br>
So now I wait for my check from the contractor.  And mentally prepare myself for all the over time I will need to work to fix my home.<br>
<br>
In short this fucking guy cut into my EQ time, RL time and time in general.  He should be flogged.<br>
<br>
Thanks for letting me rant.<br>

<br>
We hired these guys to redo our entire basement, saw pictures and plans of their previous work and the whole whatnot. We signed a contract with them for a set cost, and they sub contract out the work to these two-bit bob villa wannabes. They had unlicensed workers doing electrical work (which we found out afterward) the spackle looks like it was put on by a 4 year old (there were unsanded corners where you could tell the guy wiped his spackle knife off and left the crap to dry), they used plywood doors and they were throwbacks too (the holes for the doorknobs were set too low... like 3 feet off the ground). <br>
<br>
Basically after the first week or so I began to watch the work these guys were doing, and I would point crap out and say it had to be fixed. For every one thing they fixed, they screwed up two in return. <br>
<br>
Basically from that point on I either did the work myself, or hired reliable contractors that DON'T sub-contract.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zahrimxealdabooboos>Zahrim Xealdabooboos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/timages/page/penguin.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 349<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/29/03 12:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1481.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.craptastic.com/images/cancon/cancow.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Have you been fucked by a contractor?</span><hr size=1> This is why i am glad my brother in law is a contractor.<br>
<br>
My advice to you and others in the future is NEVER EVER yellowpage contractors, ask your neighbors, friends co-workers if they have used any, ask to see the work they have done for them.  The secret to success with contractors is getting them from people you know and/or trust.  Do not use those idiots from 'Home Base' to come do your woek either.   I know a waiter who went that route, the dude tiled his bathroom for 300.00.  My brother in-law said that covers the cost of materials, if that, so i figure in 6-7 months i'll hear that waiter crying about tiles falling off the wall and crap like that.<br>
<br>

If anyone in the colorado area needs work done feel free to e-mail (use all caps please i get too much spam) me i can send you My brother-In Laws information.  He dores Tile, Granite, Carpentry, Et All.  He rebuilt 1/4 of the inside of my parents house, removed a brick fireplace and installed a granite fireplace, he is currently doing  a few houses in the area of my parents house.<br>

Were you STUPID enough to pay him before the work was done?<br>
<br>
 YES - YOU are an idiot.<br>
 NO - Question 2<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Did you get &quot;REAL&quot; references and actually go CHECK HIS WORK?<br>
<br>
NO - YOU are an idiot.<br>
YES - Question 3.<br>
<br>
3. Did you sign a contract that allowed for a PROFESSIONAL ARBTRATION to be handled by HIS HAND PICKED ABRBITRATOR?<br>
<br>
 YES - YOU are an idiot.<br>
 No - Question 4.<br>
<br>
4. Did your contract have multiple points of sign-off that would determine points of payment that would ensure that at any time he stopped performing his work he would stop being paid?<br>
 <br>
 NO - you are an idiot.<br>
 YES - Question 5.<br>
<br>
5. Did you ASSUME that a &quot;bonding&quot; means ONE FUCKING THING about his quality of work?<br>
<br>
 YES - you are an idiot.  (bonding only prevents YOU from being sued if one of his workers gets hurt or if he should happen to burn your house down)<br>
 No - Question 6<br>
<br>
6. Did you ASSUME that a License (especially in California where they are used SOLELY as a means of massive revenue collection) means ANYTHING about his qualificiations to do the work?<br>
<br>
 YES - you are an idiot.<br>
 No - Question 7.<br>
<br>
7. Did you go out and find any one of 10,000 different &quot;So you want to renovate your house&quot; books on the market that tell you step by step how to do this sort of thing without getting ripped off and that sell for about $15 and would have saved you $4,000.00 and made your life much better and you would not be putting up with crap from a Gnome with an attitude?<br>
<br>
 NO - You are an idiot.<br>
 Yes - Ok Dude, sorry man.  You made it through those and still got screwed I'd say you found a guy just willing to shit away his reputation for a couple grand and is probably just leaving the business.  Contractors in California are the LOWEST form of life as all the certifications and affiliations and titles and licenses there all mean JACK SHIT.  They are all just means of collecting MONEY and nothing more.  They form guilds and aliances and federations that all sound really neat and they hand out wonderful books that print out pretty and they make it sound like you are protexted when in reality they arrange the contract for THEIR protection.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah.  Last question.  8. Did you have a lwyer reveiw the contract you signed?  Yes - sue your lawyer.  No - Yep, you're and idiot all right.<br>

Now you ask yourself? what the fuck does this have to do with anything? well in some contracts theres lil loopholes. like say in his contract with a union it allows him to walk off the job if at any time it is felt to be a unsafe working condition, well then your just fucked. it suckss that these rules exist, but their there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rengrey>Rengrey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/1/03 10:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1481.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Have you been fucked by a contractor?</span><hr size=1> <br>
In reference to the above post:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Were you STUPID enough to pay him before the work was done?  No, the contract was in increments.  Check the work, it passes inspection.  He gets payed.  Standard.<br>
<br>
YES - YOU are an idiot.<br>
NO - Question 2<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Did you get &quot;REAL&quot; references and actually go CHECK HIS WORK?  Yes, spoke to three people.  Two of which I knew personally.  Physically went to one of the homes.<br>
<br>
NO - YOU are an idiot.<br>
YES - Question 3.<br>
<br>
3. Did you sign a contract that allowed for a PROFESSIONAL ARBTRATION to be handled by HIS HAND PICKED ABRBITRATOR?  No, the arbitrator was appointed by the CSLB.  I wanted the issue remedied out of court.<br>
<br>
YES - YOU are an idiot.<br>
No - Question 4.<br>
<br>
4. Did your contract have multiple points of sign-off that would determine points of payment that would ensure that at any time he stopped performing his work he would stop being paid?  Yes, there were eleven.<br>
<br>
NO - you are an idiot.<br>
YES - Question 5.<br>
<br>
5. Did you ASSUME that a &quot;bonding&quot; means ONE FUCKING THING about his quality of work?  No, hence I was prudent and watched him, photographed his work etc.<br>
<br>
YES - you are an idiot. (bonding only prevents YOU from being sued if one of his workers gets hurt or if he should happen to burn your house down)<br>
No - Question 6<br>
<br>
6. Did you ASSUME that a License (especially in California where they are used SOLELY as a means of massive revenue collection) means ANYTHING about his qualificiations to do the work?  No, the license was issued by the state.  They should enforce their rules.  A governing body that lacks the tenacity to penalize is doomed.<br>
<br>
YES - you are an idiot.<br>
No - Question 7.<br>
<br>
7. Did you go out and find any one of 10,000 different &quot;So you want to renovate your house&quot; books on the market that tell you step by step how to do this sort of thing without getting ripped off and that sell for about $15 and would have saved you $4,000.00 and made your life much better and you would not be putting up with crap from a Gnome with an attitude?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Yes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, internet, books, word of mouth, neighbors.  At the time this contractor seemed to know what he was doing.  If I could do it again I would have sub contracted the work myself.<br>
<br>
NO - You are an idiot.<br>
Yes - Ok Dude, sorry man. You made it through those and still got screwed I'd say you found a guy just willing to shit away his reputation for a couple grand and is probably just leaving the business. Contractors in California are the LOWEST form of life as all the certifications and affiliations and titles and licenses there all mean JACK SHIT. They are all just means of collecting MONEY and nothing more. They form guilds and aliances and federations that all sound really neat and they hand out wonderful books that print out pretty and they make it sound like you are protexted when in reality they arrange the contract for THEIR protection.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah. Last question. 8. Did you have a lwyer reveiw the contract you signed? Yes - sue your lawyer. No - Yep, you're and idiot all right.<br>
<br>
The contract is fair.  Yes I have a lawyer.  Yes they have a copy.  Pre Paid Legal is a nice option I have.<br>

As for item 6 though, NO..  You make a bad assumption about licensing in California in particular.<br>
<br>
California is unique to most places (New York might have this too not sure) that they license EVERYONE.  When I lived that I was a tax preparer.  TO be &quot;licensed&quot; in California for doign Tax Prep you had to take X hours of class training and pay the fee and get bonded.  Bonding for a Tax Prep is only to ensure I do not STEAL people's money and there it is extremely limitted liability at best.  Basically a stupid law that gave Insurance Companies a bit of cash and little more.<br>
<br>
The License is a joke.  They never check ANYTHING beyond mailing them a certificate of hours of class taken that could have been printed on my PC.  There are what 10,000 contactors in CA.  How would you ask the State to check up on those people.  Think about it for a sec.  They's have to have 200 to 300 full times inspectors running around.  That is not reasonable.<br>
<br>
They can take COMPLAINTS and follow up but that is it.  If this guy did not have many complaints then they woudl not bother.<br>
<br>
Example: In Georgia they have an Insurance Commissioner.  He licenses insurance companies and has kicked a couple out of the state.  He get 300 to 500 complaints a year on ALLSTATE Insurance ALONE.  He cannot come close to having all of those complaints dealt with.<br>
<br>
So, who is the CSLB?  That smells like an organization that teh Builders Created for their own means.  They do that.  They create these formal sounding boards that are supposed to regulate and handle mediations but in reality they are contractors pets and are beholden to them that pays them - the contractors.<br>
<br>

Will never go back.  In 1974 you couldn't find a better place to live.  I could walk from my house to the beach and things were good.  But then it turned completely to shit.<br>
<br>
But, joking aside the questions I posed, sarcastically, are legit for ANYWHERE you might have work done on a house.  You NEED TO KNOW that in most states if ANYONE does work on your house they can file a legal lean against your house until payment is made, EVEN IF THEY don't finish the job or screw it up.  People have lost their homes from someone screwing up a roofing job.<br>
<br>
It ain't just California where things can be screwed up, but yu start three steps down that path when you do anything in California. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=1481.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=1481.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1481.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=1481.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=1481.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1481.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1481.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm69">Elemental Planes<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm75">Blank<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm72">Roleplay Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm68">Current World Events<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm71">The Book Shelf<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15>Flame Central</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246k<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
