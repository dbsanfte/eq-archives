What started it was the attendance of one of my guildmates at the Naggy raid last night as well as other members of AoVB.<br>
<br>
As laison for my guild, I post information concerning all events of CoG including sign-ups for dragon raids.  I remember this issue came up a couple of months ago and after a short discussion on the boards, it was agreed that we could attend based on the interpretation of the KCG rules.<br>
<br>
I fully understand the need to limit attendance.  I understand the desire to keep CoG available to small guilds and people without guilds.  But I ask that the rules not be changed midstream without notice.  I realize it was the pally book drop that brought this all up.  My question is:  if it was determined certain guilds should not go on the raid, why were these people put in groups in the first place?<br>
<br>
My guildmate and my guild are not responsible for whatever hard feelings have occured from this.  I will accept responsibility.  I am the one who posted signup information on our board and encouraged them to go.  We have been advised we are not to attend any further CoG Dragon Raids.<br>
<br>
All I ask is that the CoG rules be looked at again, revised and clarified to avoid further misunderstandings.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>

This is a copy of what I wrote a few weeks ago on this subject:<br>
<br>
Currently this is the way the CoG works:<br>
<br>
                            Planes raids<br>
                            -------------<br>
                            Ex. 1: Valoran member (a guild that does Planes Raids all on their own, without any other guilds, i.e. not in an<br>
                            alliance) should not sign up for planes raids sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
                            Ex. 2: Sign of One member (a guild that currently does planes raids, but they do it as part of an alliance with<br>
                            the Silent Watch, I believe) CAN and SHOULD sign up for a planes raid sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
                            Ex. 3: Mist Walkers member (a guild that does not currently do planes raids either by itself or in an alliance)<br>
                            CAN and SHOULD sign up for planes raids sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
<br>
                            Dragon Raids<br>
                            ------------<br>
                            Ex. 1 Valoran member (a guild that is in the dragon rotation by itself) should not sign up for dragon raids<br>
                            sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
                            Ex. 2 Sign of One member (a guild that is in the dragon rotation in an alliance with Silent Watch) should not<br>
                            sign up for dragon raids sponsored by the Council of Guilds<br>
                            Ex. 3 Mist Walkers member (a guild that is not currently in the dragon rotation either by itself or in an alliance)<br>
                            CAN and SHOULD sign up for Council of Guilds dragon raids<br>
<br>
                            ALL OTHER Council of Guilds Events<br>
                            ----------------------------------<br>
                            Unless specified by the organizer, ALL other CoG events are open to ANY of the above examples<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope this makes it clear. I will take responsibility for putting these people in groups. When I'm trying to manage 40 something people, I confess to not looking at their guildtags, just to putting them in groups. I'd rather not have to worry about the administrative hassle it would take to make sure that alliance members aren't on the list. Personally, I wish I could include them, as both Yari and Augie (from Silent Watch and Haven of Light respectively) offered to sacrifice themselves in a suicide run to make sure Nagafen wasn't waiting by the door for us. And they are welcome on any plane raid, or any other type of raid or CoG event that is held. <br>
<br>
As for Augie winning the book of scale, I have one simple rule for who rolls on what. You bleed, you roll. Augie bled, he died, and he got his chance to roll on the book. End of story. Anyone who has a problem with  that can talk to me about it, I'll defend Augie's right to that book to the end. <br>

<br>
I spoke to a couple of the casters that were using reagents and apparently - they didn't get reimbursed fully for their outlay in cash.  But that's another issue.<br>
<br>
Haemish, in the future - especially on Nagafen Raids - there's a sufficient amount of time between when groups are formed and the push begins towards the Stone Spider room.  I'd say if you worked fast enough - it could take roughly 45-60 minutes.  In that time - we can send a messenger to go purchase the reagents and then deliver them to the raiding party.<br>
<br>
I'd like to suggest that the moment the groups are formed, that the group leaders collect the reagent fee (50pp or 5 peridots) and hand them to the Reagent Coordinator.  The Reagent Coordinator then hands that money to a druid who then teleports to the destination of their choice and buys as many pearls/peridots/jaspers as that money can buy.  Then they zip back - hand everything over to the reagent coordinator who then apportions the reagents to the casting clerics and enchanters.  If the break begins before the reagent messenger arrives - 2 groups need to stay behind to escort that player to the stone spider room.<br>
<br>
We can't expect Clerics and Enchanter who have anywhere from 70-90 strength to be carrying around 600pp-800pp especially on raids of this magnitude.  It's not fair to them and it's not altogether a safe practice.<br>
<br>
I'll discuss with you in private who wasn't reimbursed fully and we need to ensure that we properly reimburse him the cash he spent.<br>
<br>
Thoughts?<br>
<br>
Shoji<br>
<br>
Oh and another thing - casters - don't be afraid to approach the management team with issues like this AT THE TIME they happen.  I can just about guarantee that if your concern over this issue was aired it would have been dealt with immediately.<br>
<br>
We're getting better :) <p><center>

When we needed to pay for coffins (we needed 4 of them, for a total of 600pp), I gave 150pp to Vizjeri for the 1 coffin he already had, and 450pp to Wimbus for purchasing the 3 he got in Neriak. After that, each enchanter and cleric who remained after Nagafen was dead received I think 392pp. I know one cleric left the raid as soon as Nagafen was dead and may not have been reimbursed. <br>
<br>
On the next Nagafen raid, we'll have the buffing line coordinators remind me that the reagent money should be given prior to the buffing, OR we'll do what you suggest Shoji. I'd actually prefer that we send a druid/wizard with an enchanter, as the enchanter will often get better prices on the reagents needed. Perhaps what we do is send ALL of the reagent using classes to go purchase reagents. <br>
<br>
The only place this falls down is once we've used ALL the reagent money to buy reagents, we have none left to purchase or reimburse the Necros for any coffins they use. It was quite nice to actually have the money on hand at the moment we needed to purchase coffins. <br>
<br>
Any thoughts on that? <br>

<br>
40+ raiders...x10pp extra should cover the additional cost of the coffins.<br>
<br>
lol inflation at its best...Raise the reagent fee to 60pp to cover the cost of coffins as well.  <br>
<br>
Also - sending an enchanter and the druid to pick up the reagents shouldn't take all that long.  For a Naggy Raid, have the druid and enchanter bind in Lavastorm, tp to WC - zone into EC and hit up the jewelry shop, then gate back.<br>
<br>
For Vox - have the enchanter and druid bind outside of Permafrost - teleport to WC - zone to EC - pick up the reagents and gate back.  <br>
<br>
If you run as fast your little feet can take you - round trip shouldn't take more than 10 minutes in both cases.<br>
<br>
And as far as what was left for the clerics - some of these folks bought upwards of 60-80 peridots at 10pp apiece - that's a maximum of 800pp that they spent of which they only got 392 back.  Spending 50-100pp of your own money is one thing - but 400pp is entirely another matter.  We need to make ensure thta we're defraying the costs for the casters properly.<br>
<br>
What I need the Clerics and Enchanters to tell me is -  give me a rough idea of how many reagents you absolutely must purchase for each of these raids.  We'll calculate the reagent fee based on your response.  I'm thinking 60 peridots at a minimum for one cleric (for buffing symbol), 60 peridots at a minimum for one enchanter (for Rune) X the number of enchanters - plus an assortment of Jaspers and Pearls for the other spells.<br>
<br>
That's 2k in reagents (at the minimum), plus 600 for coffins divided by 48+ raiders = 55pp &lt;scratches his head&gt;.  <br>
<br>
Hmmm - did people not pay?<br>
<br>
oh and another point - unless the casters are buying equal amounts - they may be entitled to more or less of the reagent fee.  That number has to be to communicated to management prior to splitting that fee amongst the casters.<br>
<br>
We'll work this number out :)<br>

As one of the clerics had logged by the time I got around to handing out the reagent fee, I took what was left over from the coffins and divided it by the four that were there, leaving each about 392. Some spent more than others, but it was 3:30 am, and I was in no mood to try to calculate any way other than the easiest way. <br>
<br>
We had about 40 raiders (minus the 5 reagent classes), so should have been about 2000pp, minus the 600 for the coffins, and I think Nawty gave 50pp extra. It came out to close to this, but again, I confess I didn't do much of the complicated math. I think if we handle the reagents prior to, as well as ask the necros to bring 1 or 2 coffins each beforehand, we can then reimburse the necros for any coffins we use with an extra 10pp from each person. <br>

<br>
I do not feel having someone buy reagents is necessary as long as those classes needing reagents bring their own.  I brought 80 peridots and 100 jaspers with the full intention of using them.  I know that Verius and Fazlazen also brought a great number of reagents as well.  Which is to say, we're bringing the gems...if you're going to buy them at the raid, you need to let us know before hand.<br>
<br>
The problem is that the reagent money was divided evenly among the clerics and enchanters.  This should not be the case.  Those who particiapate in the buffing line have a far greater out lay than those who do not.  Fazlazen and Verius both used 1 peridot per raid member, and Verius also used one pearl per raid member.  Their outlay was a great deal heavier than mine or Azuriems or Yari's. and therefore, they should have been compensated for such.<br>
<br>
I think this will only be a problem on dragon raids, when the buffing line is an issue.  I see two possible solutions to this.  The first, which I favor, is that casters who are to be reimbursed give the commander a rough figure of how much they spent.  Then the funds are distributed based one that.<br>
<br>
The second idea is similar to Shoji's, which is that the funds be distrubted evenly (necros being reimbursed as they are currently) but reagents for the buffing line are brought by one person, who is reimbursed, and then handed to those who are buffing.<br>
<br>
I have also heard from some unhappy shaman, and I think that issue needs to be addressed.<br>
<br>
I believe the buffing line is the problem...figure a cost of 25p per person (two peridots and a pearl) the outlay for reagents on a dragon raid with 45 participants is 1125p, for the buffing line alone.  On the Naggy raid, that cost was borne by Fazlazen and Verius alone...but the funds were distrubted equally. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/13/01 12:17:11 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Recent Nagafen Raid</span><hr size=1> What shaman are unhappy?

<br>
I noticed a couple of things that could make the buff line run even faster while watching over Baienn's shoulder(he's my lil brother). Note: Baienn was the second through the line so it may have changed over time.<br>
<br>
1. The buff line needs to be a line. When you come to each person the buffee needs to wave/poke the person signaling them they need their buff. Then the buffer buffs and waves/pokes after they are finished with that person signaling them to move to the next person in the line.<br>
<br>
2. The Buffee's do not need to enter the groups. This increases the time it takes to go through a buff line by quite a bit. Joining one group then leaving it and joining another. If you really want to put Circle of Summer/Winter and gain that 5 extra CR/FR put the druid at the end of the line. Once 5 buffees have gone through the line the druid invites em all and gets em all in one shot.<br>
<br>
3. The order of buffs matters. Baienn had FR put on first before the Crap buffs which means it got dispelled instantly. I believe that the resist should be put on last or second last with DMF last. they are more important than  HP/AC buffs no matter how much life you have if you can't resist the breath you are toast.<br>
<br>
4. I noticed that 1 cleric was doing all the cleric buffs. You would save time if you assign one cleric for each buff. Cuz I'm sure that one cleric went OOM very quickly. Same thing goes for the crap buffs. Then this way you can also be sure they go on in the correct order as they walk their way from person to person in the line.<br>
<br>
Hmm can't think of anything else. All in all you I'd say you guys did a great job for you second buff line <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Another thing I'd like to comment on is the all Tank rush. I noticed that all the tanks rushed in at once. He breathed a cpl times and all the Tanks ran back for heals pulling him out of his lair. I'm thinking maybe split the tanks into two groups. First group goes in then second group comes in when first needs to be healed. This would also be a little bit easier for the healers so they don't have to heal all the tanks at once. Just an Idea.<br>
<br>
Anyways you guys did a great job. Grats on taking down the Red Beast.<br>

i did not have naltron available to buff at the time of the raid i used pinzarn to keep my own party symbol'd during the raid up to nagafen buffing. so its no biggy. i only used about 40 jaspers in all the entire 9 hours. <p><b>Yari Arkanum - 40th Season</b>

<br>
And the thing about having another cleric too buff too would be good but the main prob was i think i was the only cleric there over lvl 49 which is the symbol of natron, sheild off wood, and death pact i guese resolution could be casted by a cleric lvl44 and up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

He was only cleric capable of casting the needed buffs.  I thought that the group thing actually worked really well.  Once they were in my group, we moved them along very swiftly.  If there was a problem it was people not listening, and not waving or poking me.  The Resist Magic group buff adds 15 more points of RM than the single target buff.  I can't speak for the sv cold/fire buffs, but I would think the group MR is far superior...and I felt the group buffing strategy worked well.<br>
<br>
I'm still for casters who use reagents bringing their own reagents...and only being reimbursed for their usage...as some couldn't even cast the peridot buffs.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But anyway we do it, I think will be fine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzatrizspiritscale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zatriz Spiritscale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/21/01 6:21:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Recent Nagafen Raid</span><hr size=1> Haemish, a question about your first post in this thread.
