<br>
If LoS wasn't so obsessed with preventing other guilds from enjoying the game content, we wouldn't have had to resort to trying to beat LoS to Venril Sathir that day. <br>
<br>
And the end result of that mass training/etc, if I recall, was both guilds were told that if something like that happened again, all officers/instigators would be banned. Correct me if I'm wrong here. So we don't have your other option as you know. Secondly, yeah right, like we're gonna walk into a new area for us and somehow have a chance at fighting LoS in what amounts to their clubhouse for the last 6 months.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we've been told quite bluntly by a GM that we're not allowed to go into NToV once another guild has inserted. And yet when we were clearing our way in, LoS CoH'd past us and suddenly they were &quot;in&quot; and we had to leave.<br>
<br>
For the record, (for the rest of the server who may not be aware of what is going on here), LoS is obsessed with keeping us out of NToV. If we plan a raid for 4pm, they HURRY to get there at 3pm. If we plan it for 2pm they DROP EVERYTHING to be there at noon. They keep moles in our guild to ensure they're one step ahead of us because they're _that_ threatened, that they're afraid we'll plan a secret raid and clear NToV before they can prevent us from getting in.<br>
<br>
LoS has made it clear that they will do whatever it takes to prevent Endorean from EVER raiding NToV. This has been said bluntly by them on many occasions, and is of course against Verant policy. (&quot;when we decide to let you into NToV&quot; - Large) <br>
<br>
Mind if we quote you on that one, Large? I'm sure Customer Service will like that one.<br>
<br>
As a result, we have no options left to us but to attempt to &quot;beat LoS to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
For a moment, think of the disadvantage we have here: <br>
<br>
We've never done NToV before and here's a guild that's been clearing it for 6 months without competition, is wearin' mostly full NToV gear, etc. and is ACTIVELY trying to keep us out. Don't give me that BS that you just want the spawns like everyone else. You've had exclusive access to those mobs for 6 months+. You only started &quot;rushing&quot; to do NToV once you thought we were ready for it. (Thanks for the compliment btw)<br>
<br>
So here we are... we're tryin' to learn the insertion and the setups and the pulls for the first time, and we have to try to somehow beat LoS to the punch. They know NToV like the back of their hand and are willing to log on any time of day to prevent us from getting in, even once.<br>
<br>
Sounds bad, don't it?<br>
<br>
Here's the harsh reality, for anyone who cares. <br>
<br>
Endorean is getting into NToV, and when we do it will be twice as hard as it was for LoS, because they had the luxury of learning NToV at their leisure without some group of childish asses tryin' to stop them every chance they got.<br>
<br>
Endorean IS going to clear NToV, and all the things that LoS is trying to do to stop us won't change that. Endorean would _already_ have cleared NToV if it weren't for LoS.<br>
<br>
I challenge LoS to prove that they're not just full of hot air, and that somehow we really are just gimps. Don't interfere with our attempts to get into NToV.<br>
<br>
If we don't clear NToV in less tries than it took LoS (BY FAR) I will publicly apologize on this board. If we don't make mincemeat out of stuff LoS struggled with, I'll apologize. Of course I won't have to, we all know Endorean will OWN NToV, or LoS wouldn't be tryin' so hard to keep us out.<br>
<br>
Endorean/Apex took out Trakanon on our first try. LoS took what, 16? Sure, LoS did it first, but all I'm sayin' is this is a continuing trend, LoS does it first (well not always...) and then Endorean/Apex does it better.<br>
<br>
If LoS weren't so threatened by us, this thread never would have started. LoS knows we took out Tormax our first night we tried.... and that was _after_ he'd been buffed.<br>
<br>
(Don't argue about how much of a corpse cannon run our first attempt was, we've seen LoS's Tormax wipeouts in the past....)<br>
<br>
Anyway, LoS knows we're ready for NToV, and Endorean will most likely own NToV in such a way that makes LoS look bad, and they just can't handle the thought of it.<br>
<br>
So there's the cards, on the table. Stop interfering with our attempts to do NToV, and we'll clear it so much easier and faster than you first did, it'll make your head spin.<br>
<br>
Or... you can keep tryin' to keep us out so you can protect your silly, dwindling &quot;we've done this and you haven't&quot; record. <br>
<br>
Yelinak? lol you know we'd have owned him by now if we had the slightest desire too. Problem is, he's not worth it, risk vs. reward. You're running out of things to say &quot;we can't even kill.&quot;<br>
<br>
(Risk/reward is why LoS hardly ever bothers to kill Yelinak, so don't deny I'm right)<br>
<br>
Anyway, LoS can talk all they want, but time will tell, just like it always has. LoS had to kill the warders before Endorean had enough keys to attempt them, to protect their little &quot;record&quot;, because they knew we were ready.<br>
<br>
All LoS's hot air just proves they ARE intimidated by us, that they know we have what it takes, or they'd leave us alone.<br>
<br>
Flame on...<br>

<br>
People that post complete bullshit as a persuasive essay accomplish a lot. It's a good way to sway the masses that desperately want to be swayed. But:<br>
<br>
1. I know for a fact that _every_ single member of Endorean (save mabye your ghetto Monks) would wear Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying. You don't kill Yelinak becuase you _can't_ kill Yelinak. I know your members want to do him, they even whine to me about it. <br>
<br>
2. We cleared NToV on our second run, the first we didn't even attempt Lord Vyemm. We were the 5th guild in all of EQ to clear NToV completely in-house.<br>
<br>
3. Comparing your Trakanon kill to ours is complete bullshit. FoH and AL both took countless attempts and out of guild help to take down Trakanon their first time. Our kill was a mere months later, and our server was incredibly young at that point. We were actually by far the youngest server to kill Trakanon, and Legacy of Sorrow was the youngest guild to kill him in-house. Was quite an accomplishment back then, but you were still farming Lower Guk, so I'll let that one slide.<br>
<br>
4. You're in a ghetto guild, get used to it - or send me a tell in-game!<br>

Kaladur made a post that actually made sense (even if it was wrong) so I responded. I won't respond to Franko cause I love seeing him post 20 times in five minutes.<br>
