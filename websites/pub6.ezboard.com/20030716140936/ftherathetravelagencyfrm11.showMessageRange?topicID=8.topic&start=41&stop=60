My god Stygar for every resolution we come up with you come up with another arguement against it.<br>
Is you fight so Noble for MFH/FoR/CIW/Bots/etc... that your the only one holding the banner?<br>
<br>
For petes sake haveing 2 members of a BB guild in the planes to ME would be the same as haveing 2 members of Nobleblade who is not a BB (and I hope they dont become one because of headaches likethese) they cleared fear in 2 hours and 48 min with Cazic up when I went with them last, They have just as much need for epic items for there guys as well. Whats preventing them from doing the same thing you want to accuse/prevent KEG from doing?<br>
<br>
Lets just all becaome the devils advocate and just bar invites as a whole. No indipendents no BB's , no body.<br>
Will that make you happy? Well oops I forget I have to worry about keeping the whole server happy and not just you. So please stop trying to tear down everything we try to make here. Its not that bad. <p>Vincecross Dhark'baen

Qwai it boils down to this<br>
<br>
A-  Either its a total problem for any BB guild to get an invite to the planes when a god is up and should be disallowed.<br>
<br>
B-  It is a problem so they should only allow 3 people to go<br>
<br>
C-  Its totally rediculious and 6 people are not the deciding faction between winning and losing.<br>
<br>
ALL i wanna see out of anyone is A,B, or C.  Im sure we all know your reasons why by now, its time to come to a decision and abide by it.<br>
<br>
BTW i have been informed that not every alliance has a delegate(s) assigned to speak for the guild as a whole.  I am working on that now and hope to have a concrete list within the next few weeks.<br>
<br>
Also another choice needs to be made:<br>
<br>
A- Rotate BB guilds every week for fear and hate, not same guild on same plane on same week.<br>
<br>
B- Rotate BB guilds as they get called up.<br>
<br>
A or B, easy choice.  Discuss this with your guild before making a decision <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

Well, whatever the decision is that the Epic Guilds come to regarding their rules for their rotation, I'll abide by it and make sure everyone is aware of it.<br>
<br>
But from where I sit, and from what I remember of the discussion, the epic rotation was put in place for 2 reasons.<br>
<br>
1 - so that if a god was up and someone couldn't handle it,  they knew who they 'could' call in (ie, be capable of taking the god down quickly)<br>
<br>
2 - the rotation was put in place so people wouldn't always ask their friend's guild to come up and help them finish off the plane.<br>
<br>
At the time the rotation was put in place to ensure all the epic guilds got a fair CHANCE at taking out a god if the raiding party didn't have the chops to take it down at that time.  Not to ensure an equal distribution of the actual epic loot.<br>
<br>
A minor point, to be sure.  But this entire blowup was over a minor point of protocol and procedure with the calendar.<br>
<br>
And if we're going to play that card, then I say tear down the epic rotation, and set up a list for every single planes-capable person that wants their epic item, and we can all just take a number and wait for a_random_item to drop so we can zone in and loot it.<br>
<br>
A hypothetical:<br>
<br>
A raid goes up, the God is up, and there are 6 guests from FoR, 6 guests from KEG, 6 guests from BotS, 6 guests from MFH, 6 guests from CiW, and 6 guests from &lt;anyone i forgot&gt;.<br>
<br>
Now, granted, that's a metric pantload of people.  But play along with me.<br>
<br>
The god goes down, and there are a total of 4 epic drops.  The 4 epic drops are determined to go to the 4 people who are closest to completing their epics. <br>
<br>
Amazingly enough, those 4 people happen to belong to 4 different guilds that are invited on the raid.<br>
<br>
Explain to me how this is a problem, beyond the fact that it takes into account social skills as well as gaming skills.<br>
<br>
As I said, if y'all are willing to compromise and say that there's a restriction to joining other planar raids as a reward for being in the epic rotation, I think that's fair.  There should be some drawbacks to getting into that rotation, and there haven't been any up to now.<br>
<br>
Something else for the Epic Guilds to consider in email discussions or offline:  What should the penalty be for the epic guild that is called into the plane within the time limit and fails to clear the god before the hard deadline of 2am PST?<br>
<br>
If you're going to expect everyone else to be held to a standard of punishment for failure to call in the Epic Guilds, there needs to be a similar standard of penalties for the Epic Guilds who fail to hold up their end.<br>
<br>
I've got some basic ideas, but i think this issue is best closed for now, and let the reps from the epic guilds hash this out in a private forum, just amongst themselves &amp; the calendar admins.<br>
<br>
Once a proposal is accepted, post it and indicate that all current epic guilds agree to it and will abide by it.  Including replies from all the guild reps that say &quot;Epic Guild xxxx Supports and will follow this policy.&quot;<br>

<br>
A,B, and C ; regarding the inviting of BB guild members to a given plane raid...<br>
<br>
I say with all confidence that 6 of the right people can have a HUGE impact on a raid. I would go so far as to say that, if the posted guild has the necessary people to do the killing, that a knowledgeable and skilled puller alone can make or break a raid.....and that's just one person.<br>
<br>
In order for the BB rotation to be a completely valid system, there should be no inviting of BB guild members to a plane on a day when a god is up. This however is a problem in itself. Should we have the right to limit further who a given guild invites along on their reserved day?<br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the original &quot;stated&quot; intent behind the proposal of a BB calendar was to see that gods were taken down promptly in an effort to maximize the number of epic items entering the game on the rathe. Either way we go, this goal is attained. Six invites may well mean the god dies within the alotted time, and if it doesn't, then the BB guild on call gets the shout. Allowing these invites means that the &quot;on call&quot; guild will likely be called less frequently than if the invites were disallowed, but the god still goes down either way. The bone of contention is truly in whether the BB guilds all have an equal opportunity to help and thus be rewarded with epic loot.<br>
<br>
No invites means that all BB guilds will have equal chance at getting the call.<br>
<br>
Allowing invites means that some guilds will likely see more epic loot than others.<br>
<br>
There's valid arguments to be made for both, but the bottom line is that the god gets dead pronto either way.<br>
<br>
                  ---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The second issue in question is to rotate on an on call basis, or on a scheduled weekly rotation.<br>
<br>
Again this boils down to equal opportunity. Given a weekly rotation, some guilds will likely be called up more often than others. What I like about the weekly rotation is that it allows a guild to plan ahead for weeks when they will be on call.<br>
<br>
                  ---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Perhaps the idea of tracking items isn't such a bad idea. Have each BB guild post an updated list of who is near completion on a given quest and what god drop they need to finish. Use this list to make the calls where help is needed to take down a god. Where two or more people from different guilds are at the same stage, the scheduled rotation becomes the deciding factor in who gets the call.<br>
<br>
Again though, this system is only fair when there are no BB invites to a plane on a god day.<br>
<br>
                  ---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
 (This is somewhat off topic, but....)One of the biggest problems the calendar has is in overregulization. In an effort to try an please as many rathe denizens as possible with what is, IMHO, a needed resource, the rules and regulations are becoming more and more convoluted. I offer this analogy; the more parts you add to a machine, the more crap you have that can break down.<br>
<br>
Whatever course is taken in a given issue, we should try at all times to keep things as simple as possible. Maintain rules that are easy to understand and don't allow for misinterpretation, and maintain a BB system that is as fair as possible and is easy to access for those who may need to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uemilsinclair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/31/01 4:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New way to do the Epic Calendar:</span><hr size=1> Suggestion:<br>

I dislike guilds dictating which guilds are allowed 6 members in and which aren't, based solely on the fact they aren't getting equal epics.  The BB rotation is NOT about loot, how many times do I need to say that?  It doesn't matter if Bots isn't getting the same amount of loot as CIW or KEG, even if it was outweighed 10-1.  BB rotation was created to ensure the Gods die, now all these &quot;but but but&quot; rules are simply a bi-product of greed and &quot;we want what you have&quot;.  If you can't handle the fact that 6 KEG members get invited to a plane and get an epic loot, get 6 Bots/CIW members invited to a plane with a God up.  All any BB guild should be concerned about is if the God dies, and within the rules, with allows for 6 invites.  Anything concern up and above that in terms of loot, is simply greed.  Colour it whatever you want.<br>
<br>
If you are going to revolve the rules for the planes around who/what/where KEG gets invited to, I demand you at least name the rule after us =P<br>
<br>
I really can only shake my head at what the planes have deteriorated into.   <p>"Half of the harm that is done in the world is due to people who want to feel important" - T.S. Eliot

<br>
Of course it's about loot. If there was no epic loot there would be no problem.<br>
<br>
Since only Bots, Keg, and Ciw were at initial meeting where all this came from they would be the ones to ask why there is a BB Calendar. Jerrica you may not think the BB calendar is about loot (you meaning you personally or KEG, which ever is more appropraite) but obviously CiW and Bots disagree.  FoR and MFH are less vocal it's hard to tell how they feel on this issue.  You said somewhere that you all were going to have another meeting with 2 reps from each epic guild. I think this may not be a bad idea, to iron out some of these things.<br>
<br>
If the epic guilds are confused on the issue how can the rest of us know how to look at it? It would be sad if these disagreements between the epics resulted in the destruction the whole calendar.<br>

Emil does bring up real and factual problems.  This is a loophole of sorts.  You can't deny it or hide behind any reasons of &quot;not allowing a guild to play with their friends.&quot;  Why is this a huge deal?  Why can't we as epics just take a &quot;back off&quot; approach to days gods are up?  I see no reason why we can't.  We are called in and priveleged to have those &quot;extra&quot; chances at gods.<br>
<br>
I don't care what anyone says everyone knows that a group of 6 can make or break the raid.  One good pull group dictates the pace and the amount of mobs in camp at any given time during the raid.  They make sure its not too much and not too little.<br>
<br>
Everyone knows that to clear Fear you must move quickly and with any wipeouts.  Yes having even one puller who has a vast knowledge of Fear can make a raid on CT successful.  And not having that knowledge up there can be detrimental to the raid, even to the point where a god can't be killed in time.  Killing the god is moot point.  Any group of 30 can kill CT(long as they don't all go LD).  Its clearing the whole plane and getting to CT that is the key to Fear.  We all know this.<br>
<br>
Those 2 paragraphs above is why we should sit and think over the 6 invite rule for epics.  Even the 3 invite rule falls short.  DBN can and will be asked to help new alliances clear Fear/Hate.  Will 6 invites help them clear Fear/Hate with less hassle?  Of course, having that veteran leadership is key to clearing planes.  Would we possibly be asked(even before hand) to help clear a plane and then realize a god is up?  Surely it will happen.<br>
<br>
I know for a fact we would do a gut check and ask ourselves if our 6 invites would make or break the raid.  If we had any doubts in our mind we would choose not to affect the raid and would allow the guild to call in the next epic guild on call.  The 3 person rule is a step in the right direction but I think that even falls short.  Sending in a puller/enchanter/cleric team can still affect the raid tremendously.  The only way to make sure a guild can do a god in their &quot;alliance/posting entity&quot; is to let them do it themselves.  If they need help, then they should be calling in the epic guild on rotation.<br>
<br>
The only way I can see around letting 6 BOTS/KEG/DBN/FR/MFH/CIW etc etc is to tell the epic guild on rotation they can come up and get the epic pieces.  That way we know for a fact that the invited guild is not doing it out of greed.  They are doing it out of friendship.  It is up to the guild doing the inviting to decide if they want to give up the epic loot by having friends up there.  If they are doing it out of friendship and still want the epic pieces to &quot;give out&quot; then they can have the &quot;friends&quot; come in and loot the pieces after the god falls.  Sure its not the same as clearing the plane but it removes ALL doubts of the guild doing it by themselves.  That is why epic guilds were created to help out the guilds/alliances that could not do the god.  Then there was a rotation to keep the call ins somewhat fair and not one sided.<br>
<br>
I will state that I believe KEG did nothing wrong.  If they continued to do it they would be within the letter of the law.  But I think some valid points have been brought to light and we need to discuss this and correct it.  After all we all decided this was a &quot;test&quot; and we would be amending some rules if we found faults with them.  This is a &quot;fault&quot; and needs some attention.

Now, BB guilds are starting to dictate who can loot and when.

<br>
The ENTIRE calendar infringes on peoples rights to play the game.<br>
<br>
But its a compromise, an exchange for the discomforts of FFA.  Its based on sharing, rotation.  The BB system should be an extension of that sharing; at first glance it was - however a loophole was discovered - the whoe point of these discussions.  You tell me im greedy because i want to rotate, to be given a shot at 1/6 of non independently killed epic loots.  On the contrary, this is not greed, its compromise, its sharing.  Its not fair in the current situation to have 1 entity on the server glean more epic rewards simply by being friends with more people on the server; particularly if these guilds could not kill the god independently.<br>
<br>
The rules and situation, as it stands is far more rewarding for your guild that the other five, so i understand your position and determination for holding on to the current rules.  But please try to be reasonable, and agree to a compromise with the other six.  <br>
<br>
The bb system was instituted to ensure god were killed asap, but i think in the spirit of the calendar system, in the spirit of sharing, it stands to reason to have a true rotation of the loot between the 6 epic guilds.<br>
<br>
I'm just looking for a way to fairly distribute epics to the guilds who can complete them.  I dont understand how that makes me greedy.<br>

You know, as do I, that it was about loot from day 1 of the BB idea...end of story. If we can't get this settled, we need to FFA patch days at the very least. OH crap there is that nasty FFA thing again. The longer this debate goes on, the more difficult it will be to agree on this &quot;part&quot; of the Calendar agreement.

<br>
I see a lot of people making that assertion, but the rules for the calendar as they are written today only address the issue of leaving a god up longer than necessary, due to their long spawn time, and having epic items go to 'a' guild that is capable of completing the epic quest.<br>
<br>
Nothing about maintaining an even distribution of equipment between the epic guilds.<br>
<br>
So if someone can post a link to their source that this was all about sharing loot equally, that could resolve this entire argument right now.  Or at least, end the bit about what the original intent was.<br>

<br>
If you want to talk about even distribution of loot, then the only 'fair' way is to spread out all the loot evenly among all the guilds.  How many times do i have to make this point?<br>
<br>
The Epic rotation in and of itself is already concentrating a large amount of loot into the hands of a small group of people.  Nobody from those groups seems to have a problem with THAT version of uneven distribution of wealth.<br>
<br>
So basically, nobody has any links to any of the threads where the purpose for the epic rotation was set forth.<br>
<br>
I'll recuse myself from any further discussion of this, since the rules regarding the epic rotation should be discussed and established by the epics, and merely yea/nay ratified (with some room for minor discussion on a nay vote) by the rest of us.<br>
<br>

PS Emil - If you think you can't get 5/6 of a group of people to sanction 1/6 of that group receiving more from an agreement made between 6/6, how the hell do you think the epic rotation ever got agreed to? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=61&stop=64>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=8.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=8.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.threadControl?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm68">Current World Events<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm69">Elemental Planes</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11>Guild Representatives Forum</a> <font color=#00FFFF> - </font><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Calendar.asp">The Rathe Calendar</a><font color=#00FFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
