<br>
First stop on today's mystery tour is one of my personal favorites Milynna. Your reply to this thread just reeked of arrogance. Milynna, your condescending and holier than thou attitude is even worse then some of the more vocal members of LoS. You have always tried to poke your nose in places where it just doesn't belong. Ever since your &quot;Council of Newbie Guilds that have no power and all our members are under level 30 but we think we are the @#%$&quot; stint back when you were like level 20 up to your sometimes radical censorship of this board, you have rubbed a lot of people's heads the wrong way. Perhaps ever since you sold your guild down the river to join up with Apex and passed the level of 9 you have gotten more experienced at the game, but I will always consider you to be the shining example of an arrogant newbie that Apex seems to be so crock full of. You guys are the biggest hypocrites in the world. I don't like a lot of the attitudes in LoS either, but at least they're open about it. So many people in Apex feel the exact same way they do but won't come out and just say it. <br>
<br>
Valas, no, quite frankly no other guild is as skilled as LoS is. Do I believe that Apex and Triad have some members more then capable of being in a guild like LoS? Hell yes; you guys have some people who know what they're doing. But overall, your level of expertise and skill at this game does not come to the level of LoS. Do I believe the members of LoS are just humanly better? No, I don't think they have some divine gift for mad EQ skills. But I believe the things that LoS has seen and experienced has improved them as players in ways that other guilds have not had the opportunity to learn from. Does Triad and Apex have the potential to get there? Yes. Not all of Apex, since a lot of them aren't really all that skilled, (and not everyone in LoS is either guys...) but both of you have the potential to get up in that elite stratosphere. You just aren't there yet.<br>
<br>
I'm sure I'm going to get flamed hard for this, but is anyone else at least a little tired of the standard &quot;Nuggets of Justice&quot; response to every thread, talking about the damn nut, and the squirrel, and their special dances? I mean, c'mon guys, it was funny the first five billion times; but after you've used it more times then apex has members it gets kinda frickin old. You guys really need some new material. <br>
<br>
No Maob, LoS does not &quot;own&quot; Luclin. They just symbolically own it, being the most accomplished guild on the server. Although you make some good points. LoS does fail too, but they're more hardcore then other people so they succeed faster, and thus advance at a faster rate. Not so sure that I feel what they say is propaganda per se, but more of an attempt to just defend their percieved superiority. And the players of Luclin will never vote, because in EQ, it is not a democracy and not every player is equal... And don't give me that, &quot;But we all pay 10 dollars a month!&quot; garbage insinuating that we're all entitled to the same things... That would defeat the purpose of the game...<br>
<br>
Aeriana, you are *very* cocky, but try to come off to appear so that people will try to think your attitude is that Apex is just a group of people that want to be casual gamers. Apex is a group of people that are casual gamers, but are wannabe power gamers. Everything you people say on the board goes along with that opinion... Wow, you stop and go to bed at 11, we're so proud of you. Unfortunately, no one gives a @#%$. And nice job with your laughing there at the end... sure shows us your vaunted maturity...<br>
<br>
And finally, Amberyll, this is not a personal flame, especially since I love our dictator talks ; ) But the attitude that you come off with which so many people are guilty of just pisses me off. Insulting a group of people's RL situation is just plain, flat out pathetic. I'm so glad that you guys are working adults with jobs and kids, but frankly, no one gives a damn. What you do outside of EQ has no relevance to what you do inside of it. Yes, some people in LoS have big egos. Why wouldn't they? It's natural. But for you to sit there and talk about how you guys are so busy with your wonderful, successful lives means nothing to anyone. All that seems to be to everyone else is you trying to self-justificate to yourself that you are better then LoS. But, check this out, in what so far as we are all concerned, you can only be better then LoS in Everquest, because.... and here's the kicker... wait for it... wait for it... WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER IN RL AND NO ONE GIVES A DAMN IF YOU'RE A LAWYER OR IF YOU HAVE KIDS OR IF YOU MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS! What we care about, (although some won't admit it...) is what level you are, what armor you have, what guild you're in, and things that are *relevant* and *pertaining* to EQ. RL is not one of those things...<br>
<br>
Apex, when you guys started out, I thought you had potential. From your original philosphies, I thought you might become a sort of anti-LoS of sorts; changing the way that people play the game. But you went through the same problems that the first incarnation of Triad (from which you guys spawned from) went through... And now, all we have left is a bunch of wannabe powergamers... Perhaps this isn't the way you really are, but from your attitudes, your posts, and the way you carry yourself, this is the way it appears. No, I'm not a big Neku fan, I think a lot of you know that. But I'm not a big fan of hypocrisy when I see it either. <br>

If you didn't notice, my first reply was talking about a NoJ+LoS team.  This team was composed of 2 Nuggets, 1 guildless (now Apex), and 3 LoS members.  We travelled the lands, conquered small women and children, and lost dreadfully at the BoTB tournament #1.<br>
<br>
And yes, we ran off shouting about the @#%$ SQUIRREL AND THE @#%$ NUT AND WE HAD FUN!  So thx to stfu about insulting my repetetiveness.<br>

Just something to chew on though...where did I say that the people of Apex or any other guild were better than anyone else? Hmm?<br>
<br>
That's just one of the grand inaccurate &quot;assumptions&quot; made from my post.<br>
<br>
The entire &quot;jist&quot; of my post centered around the fact that, unlike some of you (both LoS and non-LoS mind you, I didnt single you out), there are people who play this game for reasons other than you.  So many people fail to realize this.<br>

Oook, I have a bit of time here to address some of the inaccuracies.  Btw, Aurum, I do enjoy your posts as well. =)<br>
<br>
Aurum wrote the following addressed to me:<br>
<br>
&quot;Insulting a group of people's RL situation is just plain, flat out pathetic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Im glad you agree, because Barnes posted the following:<br>
<br>
&quot;i'm getting such great laughs from the jealous pimple faced dopes posting there&quot;<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
&quot;dude, you are no different than all the other mindless zitfaced pubes posting&quot;<br>
<br>
My post simply informed Barnes and the rest of the people on this game who believe anyone who posts on these boards are &quot;zitfaced pubes&quot; or &quot;pimpled faced dopes&quot; are hardly that. My post informed you that, at least where Apex (and some other guilds) are concerned, most of us are adults with real lives. <br>
<br>
Aurum also wrote: <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so glad that you guys are working adults with jobs and kids, but frankly, no one gives a damn. What you do outside of EQ has no relevance to what you do inside of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is exactly the type of reaction I was hoping to get from my post in the first place.  My overall point was that NOT EVERYONE PLAYS EQ FOR THE SAME REASONS AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES.  Tada!  Some of us have very different priorties, and some of us have bigger priorites outside of this game that DO impact how we play and/or approach this game.  Im sorry, but the average working adult with 3 kids who works 10 hours a day isnt going to approach the game the same way as a 15 year old kid who jumps on the game the second he is home from school until bedtime or the 20 year old college kid who is willing to skip classes to kill that &quot;uber mob.&quot;  Several people fail to realize this, and I was pointing it out.  Just as you claim that what I do in my real life has little effect in game, my point was the mirror of that --what you do in game has little effect on real life.  I do, however, believe that those who obsess over the game will suffer an impact on their real lives -- be it failing classes, having a spouse and/or significant other walk out on you because you spend too much time on the game, losing jobs, etc.-- all of which have happened.  <br>
<br>
I also pointed out in my post that, many of us dont give a damn how many uber mobs LoS or any other guild kills, simply because we dont play this game for the same reasons you do.  <br>
<br>
Arum also wrote:<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, some people in LoS have big egos. Why wouldn't they? It's natural. But for you to sit there and talk about how you guys are so busy with your wonderful, successful lives means nothing to anyone.&quot;<br>
<br>
On the ego thing, Im glad you agree that some people in LoS have egos, but my post wasnt limited to LOS -- there are others in this game with the same type of egos who arent in LoS.  As far as my real life goes, real life means a lot to me, and it means a lot to the people Ive forged real life friendships with both in my guild and outside of it.  It certainly means a hell of a lot more to me than this game.  Which, again, was the point of my post that was missed in all of this &quot;SOME OF US HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES.&quot;  Thus, all the little smartass comments made by people like the following,  <br>
<br>
&quot;I like how apex zergling rushed CT with 60+ and failed twice so they call us to come kill him , and we own with 40.<br>
npz... thats why i play this game, to show the rest of you sorry asses how to kill big shite.&quot;<br>
Chakan<br>
<br>
means jack $&amp;*% to those of us with different priorities. =)  You may get a rise out of some people but, for the most part, (and people have said it time and time again)...SO WHAT.  What the hell is &quot;showing my sorry ass how to kill big shite&quot; going to do for me?  Im still pondering this one.<br>
<br>
Aurum wrote:<br>
<br>
&quot;All that seems to be to everyone else is you trying to self-justificate to yourself that you are better then LoS.&quot;<br>
<br>
I never claimed to be better than anyone, in real life or in game.  We all have pros and cons about ourselves that make us who we are.  It certainly is those who possess all this self-love and self-importance and childish &quot;I am better than you in EQ so na na na&quot; attitude that triggered my post. =)  You may be better than me in EQ, but honestly, I could give a *&amp;^$.  My priorities, both in game and out, are different than yours.  So cut the childish banter. (That was the point of my post, Aurum, not directed at you.)<br>
<br>
Aurum wrote:<br>
<br>
&quot;What we care about, (although some won't admit it...) is what level you are, what armor you have, what guild you're in, and things that are *relevant* and *pertaining* to EQ. RL is not one of those things...&quot;<br>
<br>
Exactly my point.  That may be what YOU care about, but its not what EVERYONE who plays this game cares about.  Some place all the importance in the world on ones character in this game.  Many of us do not -- we concentrate on the individual behind the character.  <br>
<br>
Other points made by an LoS member that were addressed in my post that have been overlooked by those attacking it:<br>
<br>
Barnes wrote:<br>
<br>
&quot;I will repeat...when it all comes down and the smoke clears...what this game is really about...is loot.&quot;<br>
<br>
His opinion, and I disagreed. <br>
<br>
Barnes: <br>
<br>
&quot;seething jealous fires of the uber wannabies that post the junior achiever swill here, that just cant bear the thought that Legacy of Sorrow owns everything they can only wish will happen for them some day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Heh, not even a remotely close description of some of the people I know personally who post here.<br>
<br>
Barnes:<br>
<br>
&quot;When Wang said jump...all of Apex chimed...&quot;how high?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wrong again, and I addressed it. =)<br>
<br>
Barnes:<br>
<br>
&quot;...i think LoS is the present owner of luclin&quot;<br>
<br>
That's just such a laughable statement, I still laugh when I read it.<br>
<br>
Barnes:<br>
<br>
&quot;At the time Apex was recruiting people as fast as the officers could type..../guildinvite. There seemed to be no regard to screening applicants, just any warm body for the sake of increasing numbers.&quot;<br>
<br>
HAHAHAHAHHAHAH...*deep intake of breath*....HAHAHHAHAHAH.  Out of the mouth of someone who doesnt even have a clue how we operate.  Nice assumptions.  I see more and more false assumptions on this board from people everyday.  To use Maob's words: &quot;propaganda.&quot; <br>
<br>
And I wanted to address Large's comments (and I know they were not directed at me, but I wanted to expand a bit on how I see things.)<br>
<br>
Large:<br>
<br>
&quot;If one group does things others can't, they will be proud of it. The other group may love what they do, but still wish they could do things the other group does. It's human nature.&quot;<br>
<br>
I totally agree with that statement Large.  However, what I see prevailing on this board are posts that take pride and throw it out the window in order to debase others.  It's one thing to be proud of an accomplishment --it's quite another to take that pride and attempt to belittle the accomplisments of others, shove the accomplishment down another's throat, etc.  And ya, Im sure there are plenty of others out there be they in Apex, Triad, IB, whatever who would love to be doing the things LoS is -- I wont deny that.  But there are plenty of us out there who could care less if we ever do.  But the people who are full of themselves dont want to hear that. =)  Im not saying you do these things Large, but there are those (both in LoS and other guilds) who do.  And THAT is silly. =)<br>
<br>
You also made the comparison of a doctor with a teacher -- how the teacher would love to make the doctor's income, but is content and happy with his life.  I agree that that is a very accurate depiction of life.  However, you dont see the Doctor sending mail to the teacher or coming to the teacher's house saying stupid moronic junk like &quot;I make more money than you!&quot; or  &quot;I own joo!&quot; or &quot;Im so much better than you!&quot; or &quot;It would take 4 of you to equal the intelligence of me!&quot; or &quot;I can save lives and you cant! Im uber!&quot;  Nope, doesnt happen.  <br>

It dosen't matter if the doctor wouldn't say those things in real life. In real life we don't have message boards, which are totally anonymous. Do I see you posting under your real name? Nope.. I don't either. You know me as Large. I know you as Amberyll. That's where it ends, as far as we're concerned. That anology was to depict human nature - yours went a bit far and tried to compare an environment such as this (the message board, instant tells to anybody in the game regardless of location, shouts, oocs, says, group chats, and guild chats) with a real life situation. Also, the doctor and the teacher are single entities, not entire groups. It was merely to show a point.<br>

We don't, however, have message boards and anonymousity in real life such as we do here. That's totally different.<br>
<br>
And another thing.. I don't see many (yes, many, there are a few who have done things like this in the past) posting flames that we are more uber than others becuase we killed xxx mob. We do sometimes post when a big mob goes down, or whatnot. But it's often more common to find us throwing these sorts of insults around after being insulted by members of other guilds. I do condemn pointless flames, however am an advocate of flames against flames.

As for anonymity...to be honest, Im on a real life first name basis with a lot of people in EQ.  A lot of my friends I dont call by their fantasy names at all.  I speak regularly to these friends on the phone.  Hell, I have real life friends whom Ive been friends with for years who play this game  -- Im not going to refer to them as &quot;Simoop&quot; or whatever their in-game name may be...they will always have a real life name and face to me. =)<br>
<br>
Like Torlack, Im very much the same person in real life that I portray on EQ.  I have no reason not to be open and honest about who I am.  Sure, some people might love to hide behind anonymity in this game (as is their choice and right to do so), but I could care less if Im anonymous or not.<br>
