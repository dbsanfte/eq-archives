Storyline.....It Begins.......<br>
<br>
************************************************************<br>
<br>
The members of the High Council had all gathered around in the chamber room of the guild hall of the Emerald Phoenix to convene for their monthly roundtable discussion. As they were talking about the goings on in the guild there came a knock on upon the chamber room door.<br>
<br>
Squire Feudil dismissed himself from the side of Lady Larisian to see what this interruption was about. He opened the door and left the room to return a few seconds later.<br>
<br>
&quot;M'Lady&quot;, said Squire Feudil, &quot;Two of the guilds scouts have returned from their scouting mission.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; responded Lady Larisian.<br>
<br>
&quot;They wish to make a report to you. They say that is a matter of urgency otherwise they would have averted from interrupting your meeting.&quot;<br>
<br>
A hushed exchanged of words circled the chambers between the council members gathered as the two rouges entered the room.<br>
<br>
They strode into the room side-by-side silently and smoothly stopping at the head of the council table. The members of the council knew these two scouts well.<br>
<br>
Sir Jarar Dieberi and Lady Imoen Soulseeker, both around the same age, both kneeled before the council then rose to address those assembled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Met Sir Jarar and Lady Imoen. What news do you bring to us?&quot; asked Lady Larisian.<br>
<br>
Sir Jarar spoke first. All of the council members stared in the scouts direction in wait of was to be said<br>
<br>
&quot;M'lady, members of the High Council, I bring news that does not bode well for the realm of Norrath nor Emerald Phoenix. During our recent scouting mission to the outlying areas of Innothule swamp Lady Imoen and I infiltrated a camp of Ogres disguised as Dark Elves. We passed ourselves off as travelers to Ogguk. During our stay with this camp we discovered that a group of Ogres, Trolls, and Dark Elves known as the Severed Souls is planning to bring darkness to our realm.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, M'lady,&quot; interjected Lady Imoen, &quot;There numbers at this time are not known and their plans as to when and where were not revealed to us. They are led by a one Rukkas Bashimgud (sp?), an Ogre.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah so his threat has come to pass,&quot; sighed Lady Larisian.<br>
<br>
&quot;What threat might that be M'Lady?&quot; asked Lady Tarnia.<br>
<br>
&quot;I ran in to Rukkas in Oasis of Marr on day while traveling. He was alone at the time so posed no threat to me. As I slipped behind a tent of gypsies and used my hide discipline I could see him sniffing at the air. I did not move for fear of being found out but I soon found out it did not matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me kan smel uz lity. Me not noze wher uz iz but me noze a forist smel shud not b in du sand. Me noze that u not gud to ogur. Me not git uz now, but me promiz me git utterz and com bac to git uz&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He then went along his way, constantly sniffing the air to make sure that he was not being followed. I really thought nothing of it at the time and quickly forgot about the incident.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is too bad I was not with you that day M'Lady!, exclaimed Lady Tarnia. &quot;We could have cut him into little pieces. Sir Stormwynd would have loved to practice his cooking skills with Ogre meat. Albeit it would not be fit for consumption by us but our Squires Misha and Ivan would have ate like kings.&quot;<br>
<br>
The council let out a laugh at Lady Tarnias remarks about her Squires and eating like kings.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir Jarar and Lady Imoen....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye M'lady,&quot; they said in unison.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like you take leave of us for now. The High Council will discuss this possible invasion of Dark Ones into our territory.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Squire Feudil!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes M'lady!, appearing from out of the shadows behind her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please make arrangements for Sir Jarar and Lady Imoen to have lodgings and food. See that provisions are packed for a trip that will no doubt have to make if we are to discover more information.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish M'lady!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Squire Ican!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes M'lady!&quot;, also appearing out of the shadows from behind her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please inform all of the officers of Emerald Phoenix, including those in training that their services are needed. Have them meet in here in 3 hours time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish M'Lady&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We have much to discuss..................&quot; <p><FONT SIZE="+1">Be Safe!  Have Fun! No Dying!</FONT><BR>

The feasting hall is filled with clamour of dark elven wizards exchanging spell casting tactics and troll warriors slashing at the air displaying the speed of the blades they weild. Many of the tribe's fighters pass through this hall and stop to have their meals brought to them by one of the many halfling slaves that run about fetching plates of food and goblets of wine. <br>
<br>
On this eve the tribe's more noted members have gathered at the request of the ogre shaman that leads them, Rukkas Breenga. Rukkas looks around the main feasting table at the various faces and nods. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ruk bring yus heer taday to tell yus bout new enemy to bash.&quot;<br>
<br>
The group rumbles at this news and eyes the ogre shaman closely listening closely to his words.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yus all kno da smel of litey of da woods rite?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yesss orkhalla&quot; Chukara, leader of the Forsaken Knight family hisses.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yuh! Meez eet many not trolls from da woods. Meez kno how dey stink&quot; replies the Shattered Crypt's famliy leader.<br>
<br>
Rukkas continues, &quot;Ya well Ruk kno dat stink to. Me smel it wen me wuz in da oasis da udder day. Stoopid litey try an hide frum Ruk but Ruk stil smel him an kno him wuz der. Me no tink anyting of it den.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya der lotsa dem stikin wood elfys in da oasis huntin stufs&quot; Wretched Heart family leader Rakkas interjects.<br>
<br>
Rukkas nods at his brother's input. The ogre shaman grabs a handful of food and shoves it into his huge mouth. Chewing hungrily he swallows the appetizer and gulps down a large mug of ogre swill and then continues his speech.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well da udder day wen me bring yus to da tokkin hall to speek bout bashin mor liteys so souls can get cupla new slaves fer da fuud servins me got da same stink in me noze as me did in da oasis dat day!&quot;<br>
<br>
The feasting hall roars as trolls, ogres, iksar and dark elves all express their obvious displeasure in this news.<br>
<br>
Slipping her hair past her ear and flipping it behind her, the lady necromancer Kishta speaks coolly, &quot;ye are saying that those light skinned demons have been inside our halls orkhalla?&quot;<br>
<br>
The shaman nods.<br>
<br>
&quot;RAAAAHHHHGGHGHRR!&quot; roars Rakkas bringing two clenched fists down full weight onto the table in front of him. The thick wooden table folds under the might and rage of the ogre shadow knight. &quot;WE WILL BASH AN MASH DEM INTO DUST!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The roars are picked up by all in the tribal halls of the Severed Souls and the sound booms out into the sparse forest of the Feerott echoing off the small hills the lead into the Rathe Mountains. <br>
<br>
The tribe leader raises his arms and waves them slowly, regaining the attention of the frenzied group before him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ruk tink dem herd us tokkin of getin new slaves fer da tribe an mebbe dey plan on try an stop da Souls. Me tink we shud mash dis thret befor dey hav chans to try.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yesss i agree orkhalla!&quot; Chukara cries &quot;My family ssshall be assembled and ready at your call.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, your kheros will be ready to dismember any that stand against you&quot; Kishta says, her voice hushed and filled with malice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meez famly gona slash an splash anyting in da way!&quot; the troll warrior bellows. &quot;Tump famly redy!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya! So wen we bashin brudder?&quot; ask Rakkas.<br>
<br>
Rukkas grins a wicked toothy grin. &quot;Com. We eet den Ruk tell yus wut me tinkin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking around at the broken table and floor soiled with food and drink the ogre shaman shouts down the halls toward the oven room. &quot;Cleen dis mess up an get Ruk new table fer mor eetins nows!!&quot;<br>

Now finding himself in the later years of his training his approach was more natural and fluid, rather than the careful calculated prowlings of his younger years.<br>
<br>
A hissed whisper slipped from the shadows immediately behind Lady Larisian, cutting straight into her ear and startling her.<br>
<br>
&quot;When it comes, the landscape listens,<br>
&quot;Shadows hold their breath;<br>
&quot;When it goes, 't is like the distance<br>
&quot;On the look of death.&quot;<br>
<br>
Larisian's eyes narrowed suspiciously.  She held motionless, tense, waiting to respond to any act threatening her self - an act which she now anticipated nervously.  Yet the very idea that she should suddenly be threatened in her own hall...  The guards posted at the door lowered their weapons and began to approach.<br>
<br>
Fearing the immediacy of her stalker, Larisian lifted her hand slightly and the guards stood still.  &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear, you folks are so jittery.&quot;  A tittering giggle filled the guildhall - a giggle Larisian instantly recognized.  Her muscles released with the soft breath that crept from her mouth.  Her mouth turned quickly to a warm smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;I only came to return this.&quot;  Mumsley slipped from behind her....so odd that nobody had seen him standing there before.  He held out a small broach, glistening gold with a large, glittering emerald.  &quot;I believe that it...&quot;  Mumsley coughed, &quot;...fell...to the cold vellium flagstones when we embraced in greeting last time we met in the new lands.  I shouldn't like those silly dwarves in Thurgadin to have such a thing, so naturally I grabbed it to return to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Larisian responded with sarcasm, &quot;Naturally--&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, that's all,&quot;  Mumsley turned to leave.  Larisian lifted her hand to wave, only to find that suddenly he was gone.<br>
<br>
A voice crept from behind her again.  She couldn't help but tense up in memory of the startle she had been given earlier.  &quot;Say....I couldn't help but overhear.  I don't like to remember it, but I have spent some time imprisoned in Oggok.  I made my escape through....certain....underground passages beneath the city.<br>
<br>
&quot;The purpose of those passages is too terrible to relate, but suffice it to say that the extreme difficulty with which I extricated myself from there gives me a long studied familiarity with every twist and turn of every passageway.  They are quite extensive and I'd wager that I could find my way to almost anywhere in the city above, should such come to necessity.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have but to ask....&quot;<br>
<br>
The sounds of a merry mandolin playing a jig drifted through the hall, gradually receding to the far doors and out into the cold, dark night.<br>

Lady Larisian: <br>
<br>
While in east commons today doing more scouting i was disguised as a dark elf when i came across a Cleric of Severed Souls. Being as she was sitting and reading from her spell book and was not really paying attention to her surroundings I folded my guild colors up and hid them. Hail Fellow Dark Elf How Are thee Today? We talked for a bit and she prayed to her dark god. For i don't know what she prayed for.. But i soon found out. As we talked a lone sole ran by. Run he shouted!!!!! I looked around to see a Ranger scowling at me. All i could do was fight M'lady as the battle went On and i drew deadly posions out My guild Colors flew. It took a second or two after this cleric buffed and healed me to realize what and who she had just cast her spells on. The first words out of her mouth where. Why Dark one? Why must you follow Them in there ranks? This is where our battle started as we fought it was a long battle. She finnally shouted That Emerald phoenix Would fall!! As she ran for west commons.<br>
<br>
M'lady There evil power is strong as i battled this seasioned cleric you could fill the evil from her. Please M'lady Put watchies up around the Fort. And squires around you. I haven't Seen Sir Jarar since our last meeting. I will send you another letter when i can.<br>

<br>
&quot;Lord Rukkasss, I have been closssely monitoring the sssituation here in my landsss and have noticed isolated membersss of Emerald Phoenix moving about Kunark.  <br>
<br>
Given my knowledge of the local terrain, I believe we can ssstrike at these weaklingsss before they know what hit them.  I highly recommend we organize a force composssed of our Iksar membersss.  I am sending with thisss spirit messenger a list of prime candidatesss.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chukara clapped his hands together to finish the incantation, binding the message to the spirit's mind.  &quot;Go forth,&quot; he gestured in the direction of the Severed Souls fortress, &quot;and seek out our master, Rukkasss.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the spirit disappeared through the wall, already on its way across Norrath, Chukara sat back in his favorite chair, admiring the feel of the silky Brute fur stretched between the supple yet strong Frogluk bones. It was a matter of pride to kill his enemies slowly, through subtle means that left the corpse unmarked.  <br>
<br>
His wizard brethren in the tribe usually favored a more direct means of elimination, thinking that a completely destroyed corpse was a fitting corpse.  Usually there was nothing more than a blackened scar left over when Vdar or Malcar was finished.<br>
<br>
Chukara sighed briefly, thinking of the waste of so many valuable trophies as he surveyed the walls of his labratory, adorned with the prizes of past conquests.  He snapped his fingers and a large grey wolf silently padded over from the corner where it had been sleeping in a pile of bearskins.  Stroking the wolf's fur, Chukara bent and looked into the unblinking yellow eyes and chuckles.<br>
<br>
&quot;How would you like to go hunting for a new type of trophy, my pet?  I have a sssudden yearning to bring down a phoenix.&quot;<br>
<br>
His evil laughter echoed through the labratory as the wolf bared his teeth in agreement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usirstormwynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Stormwynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/3/01 1:20:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Severed Souls vs. Emerald Phoenix</span><hr size=1> As the candle burned low in his small chamber, Sir Stormwynd kneeled in prayer to Erollisi, contemplating his deeds this day....<br>
<br>
  After dispatching some Tier'Dal that refused to allow the love of Erollisi into their hearts, the paladin thought that his trials for the day were over.  As he often did after a long day, he set up his spit and and prepared a warm meal. He had heard that the brothers Rukkas and Rakkas were nearby and, after breaking his fast, &quot;prepared&quot; their bretheren for an appropriate homecoming--definitely a distasteful task, but one that seemed proper at the time. A short time later, the half-elf broke camp and set out for the Coldain city of Thurgadin.  While crossing the bridge into the city proper he stumbled upon the vile brothers, despite their reluctance to show themselves in the open.  It would not have been proper to dispatch them in the halls of his hosts, but he did deliver the blackened Tier'Dal to his enemies and vowed that they would meet again another day so that he could bring to them the light of Erollisi.  After leaving them with some wine to ease the pain of their certain defeat(and perhaps scrambling their wits somewhat), he continued into the city sure that one day he would see them vanquished.....<br>
<br>
....Sir Stormwynd arose feeling light of heart, confident that Erollisi would approve of his actions this day.  As he prepared for sleep, the knight saw Squire Ivan bound down the hall searching for someone; but before Stormwynd could hail the faithful squire, he was already gone. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usirstormwynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Stormwynd</A> at: 2/3/01 11:05:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udurani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Durani</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/3/01 3:34:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Severed Souls vs. Emerald Phoenix</span><hr size=1> Sitting in a hand carved chair at home in the city of Kelethin, Sir Durani takes a pause from writing to take a sip of Tunare's Finest and continues. . .<br>

Hail Lady Larisian and beloved guild master<br>
<br>
I have come back from my many months of wandering, much of which was spent in the new untamed wilderness of Kunark.  I bless Tunare for the oppurtunities that I was afforded.  I write now to tell you of my return and offer my humble services.  On the wind did I hear rumors of evil spreading through Antonica and have journeyed to see for myself.  Several days back I encountered two disreputable characters of Severed Souls while traveling through Southern Ro.  Not wishing to start a confrontation without your permission I exchanged pleasentries with Malcar and Fiesha.  I was also constrained further from action out of need to render assistance to Matric of our guild in Timorous Deep.   I hope to soon be allowed to reexchange pleasentries.  But on to more important details, during my wanderings I have happened to make friends and enemies alike.  In Kunark, during a battle with an giant lizard creature I was heavily injured.  Too my surprise one of the Iksar came to my aid.  It appeared his dislikes for the lizards was greater than his dislike of me.  What surprised me even more was his offer to help care for me in my injured condition.  I spent many months hidden in a abandoned house outside of the once great city of Cabilis. I would have tried to see it but the chance of meeting a less friendly iskar was great.  I think we became eventually companions but friendship may be more than distant.  While recuperating though I did manange to learn their langauge and now am quite versed.  Also my companion it seemed was wordly traveled and had  even been to Neriak.  As a way to spend time he taught me the language of our misguided brethen.  Alas I doubt there will ever be peace among elves.  I will not mention my companions name for that would truly put him or her in grave danger from his fellows.  The lands of Kunark are full of good creatures, but much has been perverted by the Iksar.  In scouting I also found that like the Fier'dal  the Tier'Dal have an outpost as well in Kunark.  My time for writing goes short as I hear a knock at my door, no doubt some small healing for me to do.  I lay my information in your hands and await your desicion.  With this letter is a token by which means you can contact me at any time, I will most likely be at my dwelling or a tavern here in Kelethin but one never knows when the road may call.  With that I give greetings to thee and the esteemed members of the council.<br>

He slows as he approaches two of his esteemed tribe members Galtor and Kruthruk carrying something tucked tightly under each of their arms, followed closely behind by the khalla of one of the tribe's families, Chukara.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wut yus got der Chuka?&quot; Rukkas inquires.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings Orkhalla,&quot; replies the Iksar shaman with a bow, &quot;we have found a few halfling's to put to work in the manning the stoves to replace those that have..disappeared&quot;<br>
<br>
Rukkas grins evilly as he eyes his sandwich. &quot;Ya dem do keep goin away huh? Hehe.&quot;<br>
<br>
The pair of ogres grasping the halfling prisoners chuckle and pat their tiny guests hard on the head. <br>
<br>
&quot;No let Tump get deez tho&quot; Kruthruk snickers.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have ssomething I believe will please you as well orkhalla&quot; Chukara states proudly.<br>
<br>
The ogre shaman raises an eyebrow at his iksar counterpart &quot;wuts dat?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;These tiny rodentss are from that band of troublemakers we keep running into of late. Emerald Phoenix hehehe&quot; the scaled shaman cackles with a twisted maniacal look on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;HEHAHA! GUD GUD! dat teech dem stoopid liteys wont it?&quot; Rukkas bellows.<br>
<br>
He bends over snatching one of the halflings up by the shirt collar. The halfling trembling uncontrollably shrieks under the ogre's grasp. Lifting it to eye level he tells one of them &quot;wunder if dem gona miss yus at all hehe.&quot; The ogre drops the halfling to the floor which is quickly snatched up again by the ogre warrior standing close by. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wer Galtor go wit deez Ruk?&quot; the warrior asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get sum chayn an take dem to da stove room. Let dem werk on tonites dinna heha.&quot;<br>

Feudil Gimmley and Lady Larisian had said their vows to each other a couple of hours ago.  There was much rejoicing at the reception, with plenty of Booze provided by Lady Tarnia, along with wedding cake for all, courtesy of Mumsley.<br>
<br>
As the newly married couple strolled the path from Felwithe to Kelethin admiring their surroundings, Squire Ican followed close behind.<br>
<br>
The couple came over a rise on the path to see Kelethin insight.  They continued to walk along the path towards Kelethin and a honeymoon night that would not be forgotten.<br>
<br>
As they reached the bottom of the rise Larisian turned to make sure her Squire was following behind.  When she turned he was not there.  She expected him to come over the rise any second now.  She waited a few more seconds and he still failed to crest the rise.<br>
<br>
Larisian told Feudil to stay put on the path while she went to look for her Squire.  She ran back up the path and over the crest to see only and empty trail.  As she backtracked along the path she happened upon and area that looked like a scuffle had occured.  She called out for Ican but did not get any response. Now she hurried back up the path towards Feudil, worried for his safety.<br>
<br>
She never felt afraid in her homelands.  They were always safe.  What has happened to Ican?<br>
<br>
As she came over the crest she arrived just in time to see a dreadful sight.<br>
<br>
A band of Dark Elves and Ogres were surrounding Feudil.  He tried to fight them off but there were too many.<br>
<br>
Larisian let out a scream and charged with blades drawn.  With this scream the attackers turned to face her.  As she drew near a large Thundering sound rang out through the air.  Just as she got within striking distance the entire group disappeared before her into a Mystic Portal, and were gone.<br>
<br>
Larisian fell to her knees, stunned at the events that had just taken place.  As she knelt there trying to collect her thoughts she felt something whistle by her ear and strike the tree next to her.  She turned to see an arrow embedded into the trunk of a tree with a parchemt attached to it.<br>
<br>
She got up and walked to the tree removing the arrow and opening the pachment.  She began to read:<br>
<br>
&quot;We the followers of Rukkas, Leader of Severed Souls, have taken capture two halflings of your order.  These halflings will be put to work serving us until they die.  We have taken them in return of your unjust acts towards us.  Do not attempt to rescue them as you and your order will meet your demise.  How does it feel to be a wife and widow on the same day?&quot;<br>
<br>
Larisian screamed at the top of her lungs after reading this.<br>
<br>
&quot;With the power that has been given to me, With the oath I ahve taken to uphold all that is good and honorable, We the Order of Emerald Phoenix declare War on those that are affiliated with Severed Souls.  You shall all meet your maker soon&quot;<br>
<br>
She rose to her feet, wiping the tears from her eyes, and ran down the path to Kelethin.  There would be much preparation necessary to attack and rid this land of the evil Severed Souls. <p><FONT SIZE="+1">Be Safe!  Have Fun! No Dying!</FONT><BR>

The Severed Souls stock of supplies was beginning to run low and time to restock had come. <br>
<br>
Rakkas, ogre shadowknight and leader of one of the tribes oldest families, had been the first to notice the shortage and snatched up two of their newly found workers to go out with him and get new stock. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hury up dum hafling! GRR! Yus muvin to slo and Rak is hungry!!&quot; the ogres barks.<br>
<br>
Ican looks at his halfling friend and sighs. &quot;I am not sure how much longer I can take being here serving these oafs&quot; he whispers to his small companion Feudil. <br>
<br>
Feudil nods slowly so as not to alert the ogre of their communicating back and forth.<br>
<br>
&quot;RAK! RAK!&quot; a yell comes from down the trail. The figure of a troll appears on the trail running top speed toward the ogre and his captives. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dat band of pale skins is formin up ova by da mowntins of rath! Me seen dem wen me wuz on me way to barsh stufs in da lake! Wut dey doin heer? Wut dey tinkin?!&quot; Frakk says excitedly.<br>
<br>
The ogre growls &quot;Rak bet dey tink dey getin deez twu bak. HA!&quot; he kicks one of the halflings in the shoulder sending him tumbling down a small hill.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grab dat one der an go tell Ruk wut goin on. Me keep dis one wit me an get redy to smash deez liteys&quot; Rakkas commands.<br>
<br>
With a nod Frakk dashes off into the gloom of the forest and heads for the Souls gathering hall.<br>
<br>
&quot;RUKKAS!&quot; comes a shout from the entrance of the hall. The ogre shaman turns to see what the commotion is and sees one of the Souls proud members dashing through the halls towards him. Breathing heavily Frakk gives the news of the Emerald Phoenix and their arrival to the forest.<br>
<br>
&quot;HA! dey com fer dey litle frends huh? GUD DEN LETS SEE IF DEY CAN TAKE DEM BAK!!&quot; the ogre roars. <br>
<br>
Orders are bellowed through the tribe's halls and fighters that had not left for further hunting grounds are assembled and prepped for battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dis wut we gona do. Yus yung Souls go out der an keep dis litle one Frakk got heer safe. Take him wit yus so dem Feenix bashas can see wut we got. Let dem see dat we got him an not letin him go! HEHA! Ruk go find Rak and see wut udder olda souls me can get togedda and we keep da udder hafling wit us. Yus all no fite neer us cuz yus no can do much agenst dem olda seezon fitas. Kill dem yung ones we handle da old. Now GO!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fighters of various classes pour out of the tribe's entrance. Iksar warrior's, dark elf magicians, troll shadowknights and several others make up the entourage that is to take on the Emerald Phoenix hunters. <br>
<br>
Rukkas runs out into the forest and meets up with his brother Rakkas and an esteemed fighter in the Souls named Ariakane. The two shadowknights stand before the orkhalla grinning and postured for battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm afraid it will be just us defending this halfling they seek orkhalla&quot; Ariakane states &quot;many of our older hunters are not in this realm at this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, dats ok. We take on wuteva dey toss at us an kill dem ded!&quot; Rukkas says.<br>
<br>
With that said a shout comes from out of the darkness of the forest. &quot;We have come for our family that you have foolishly taken you beasts! Arm yourselves and prepare to fall!&quot;<br>
<br>
A pack of wolves charge out of the dense forest toward the small band of fighters. Rukkas clutches the halfling tight and begins to cast. Ariakane and Rakkas ready their blades and stand ready for the charging wolves. <br>
<br>
The first to attack was one named Snakeater a ranger of many seasons. The shaman's casting was finished and the ranger's frenzy was drastically slowed. His bites much less rapid than what he had hoped and now much less dangerous. More wolves came pouring out of the darkness and moved in between the shaman and his shadowknight fighters. The ogre shaman spots what his brother is fighting a short distance away and begins to cast once again. A force of energy slams into Rukkas and stuns him and interupts his casting. Now surrounded Rukkas can no longer see where his companions are fighting. Attacks come from all sides biting and kicking. He tightens his grasp on the captive and runs off into the dark forest trying to distance himself from his attackers so he may launch an offensive attack of his own. <br>
<br>
Rakkas was off a good distance away from both his brother and Ariakane. The number of attackers and the frenzy of the attack had separated the three. The ogre shadowknight was determined that if he were to fall this day there would be at least one that fell with him from the assailaint's tribe. He swung his sword wildly hacking and chopping at one of the wolves that attacked him. He too had attacks coming from all sides but remained focused on the one directly before him. The ogre unleashed a furious attack making the wolf he focused on writh in the grip of agony and with another swing of his vindicator sword sent the wolf crumpling to the ground unconscious. He turned his attention to the next attacker. Feeling his energy slowly slip away with each attack the ogres swings lessened in intensity. Suddenly all he saw was black and was no longer aware or concerned with the fighting around him as he falls heavily to the ground.<br>
<br>
With one of the defenders down more attention could be focused on the shaman which was their next target. Surrounded now the shaman had very little hopes of landing his offensive spells to take down his attackers. The wild dogs bit and kicked at the ogre slowly draining his life from him. Stabbing wildly with his spear Rukkas was intent on damaging the Phoenix members as much as he could to make them pay for their boldness. Very low on health the ogre runs to a safe spot again so that he may heal himself so he can in turn inflict more damage on his attackers. Feeling better the ogre stabs at the wolves again who continue to bite at him and continue to interupt the ice blasts he attempts to land. Again he begins to feel weak as the attacks take their toll on him. Rukkas starts to cast a heal when a wolf bashes him from behind. Spell interupted and short on health the ogre tries again. A blast of energy slams into the ogres large body stunning him. Another blast of energy follows shortly behind knocking the ogre to the ground and rending him unconscious.<br>
<br>
Ariakane was now the only elder hunter remaining. He ran in the shadows, popping out at different times and in different locations hacking at the enemies that had taken down his family members. Doing all that he could to aggravate the Phoenix elders he continued to pick at them slowly. The dark elf popped out of the shadows to launch an attack on one of the shaman that had his back exposed to him landing his blade with full force square into the shaman's back. The shaman's pet viciouslt attacked Ariakane and soon the pack of wolves that had taken down the ogre duo were on Ariakane as well. It was not long before the bites and kicks along with the blasts of energy took their toll on the dark elf shadowknight. Fighting hard and vigilantly Ariakane too was overcome.<br>
<br>
By this time the fighting among the younger hunters in both organizations had also begun. The battle here was magnificent. Blows were exchanged on both sides, spells were being cast and finding their target in full force. One by one fighters from both sides fell, but in this case the Phoenix hunters were falling more quickly than the defending Souls. Soon the rescue team for the Emerald Phoenix was down to its last attacker and then there were none. <br>
<br>
The invaders had rallied together and retreated from the forest taking Ican with them. All the fallen Phoenix fighters were gathered up and taken back with them and the fallen Souls slowly rose to their feet.<br>
<br>
The Phoenix had come in and taken back one of their own on this day, but the other, the one they call Feudil, was still in Severed Souls hands.<br>
<br>
The Souls assemble on the bridge in the forest and Rukkas looks at his family of fighters. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yus all did gud taday. Dey took one of dem haflings bak frum Ruk but yus all stil got dis one. Dey gona pay fer comin in heer. Dey gona pay fer takin bak wut we take frum dem. Dey gona pay.&quot;<br>

The normally still depths were unusually alive with shiny scales and hungry teeth, attracted to this spot by the blood and gore that even now continued to drip and ooze into the water below.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhhhh...dat feelz guud&quot; he sighed to himself.<br>
<br>
Baiting his hook with another chunk of congealed blood he threw out his line again, whistling happily as he glanced at the heap of toothy monstrosities he had pulled from the swirling river so far. The catch was always better after a battle had taken place near its' edges....<br>
<br>
His eyes glazed over as the details of the night before ran through his mind. Absentmindedly scratching his bum it all came back to him.....<br>
<br>
...the discovery of the enemy massing at the fringes of the Souls' stomping ground, intent no doubt on rescuing their lost comrades...the alert being delivered and the cries of &quot;To Arms!!&quot;...the members of the tribe who were present rushing gleefully to bash the impudent intruders...Orkhalla Rukkas decreeing that the new slaves be brought to taunt their erstwhile rescuers with...the decree that the tribe split into two forces to better meet the threat on equal terms...the --<br>
<br>
&quot;AYUH!!!!!&quot; he bellowed.<br>
<br>
 Frakk hastily yanked his feet out of the cool soothing waters -and caught himself as he reached for his huge two handed sword which lay by his side-<br>
<br>
&quot;INNUTHULE'S BALLS!!!&quot; he cursed, locking his huge gnarled hands in a death grip around the head of a loathsome leechlike creature, which in turn had all of Frakk's right foot inside of its' maw, he squeezed with all his considerable trollish might..and fell over backwards onto the bridge, pulling the rest of the 12 foot creature over the rail on top of him... <br>
<br>
After composing himself Frakk cursed himself for not noticing the slimy caress of its' probing maw in time, but then smiled as he thought of the stew he would make of it later...he recast his line and let his feet drop down again after turning his beady eyes to the waters for a full minute first...<br>
<br>
&quot;Now werr wuz I...oh yah!&quot;<br>
<br>
...the Elders crossing the bridge to meet their foes...the somewhat younger members staying on the near side-taking their hostage deep into the forest, counting on their familiarity of its' dark recesses to grant them opportunity for ambush of the interlopers...then the battle of the Elders!...cries of Vengeance Sworn! and Defiance echoing through the leaves and mists...against the superior numbers of the massed Emerald Phoenix Guild the Elders falling in combat, unable to overcome such odds..we, the younger members chafing at our inaction...the supposed craft of the tree huggers and wilderness walkers failing to bring them to us...finally unable to take it anymore we run to the bridge!...our warparty meeting the disgusting little creatures on the bridge...the battle ensues!...we swear revenge!...we clash...mighty Qamar and Slithers fighting alongside...the crafty Vallaes with his elemental servant...the blood and sparks flying as Frakk helps to cut down two of the vermin down personally...a red haze covers all...though some tribe members fall the battle is won...and the carnage is shared by both sides...as are the victories, and the losses..........<br>
<br>
Frakks' toes jerk out of the water as he is startled by a nearby lizardman emerging from the darkness, both stare at each other and the lizard wisely chooses to back away into the mists.<br>
<br>
Discovering his pole has broken Frakk gathers up his dinner and breakfast into his favorite bags, pulling his boots on he notices the pools of sticky gooey gore, unable to dry due to everpresent mists and cool dampness. His eyes grow large as inspiration comes into his small brain, with painstaking toil he manages to scrape up a considerable amount of the slimy detrius left over from the lifesblood spilled here so recently, filling his upturned helmet with it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dis maek a grate bastin soss for dese fishies! De udders are sure to want da resipee!&quot;<br>
<br>
 Frakk grins widely to himself, happy and dreaming of more lighty bashing to come...and sweet revenge for the losses suffered...strolling up the path he could almost taste the flesh of the ones who would fall to the Tribe...<br>
<br>
&quot;Har har! Dey iz gunna be soo jellus of my fishies tonight!&quot;<br>

A discordant whistling fades with him into the fog, and a chuckle echos softly mingled with the heavy receding footsteps...<br>

____________________________________________________________<br>
Forseen Shadows<br>
<br>
The lost and confused knight stood alone on the plane that was dotted with the mangled corpses of fighters from which streams of blood trickled. Ariakane pivited slowly as he observed the battle site...small fires were scattered, creating a smog environment as the dense foilage barely let the smoke free. The sun had set and only faint lights from a nearby camp could be seen in the distants and of course the nearby fires. The many corpses were spread all around, each with its own special and unique position, a result from their struggle. There was no sign of life, save for Ariakane's. His eyes scanned the scene and stopped on a way too familiar set of armor that layed sprawled next to a slain wood elf. Ariakane made his way and hovered over the corpse, looking down at the recognizable set of Darkforge Armor that was customly made to fit on the knight. What caught Ariakane's attention was the dragon that had been scrawled into the pauldrons of the armor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tagnik'zul,&quot; he whispered softly.<br>
<br>
Ariakane removed his gauntlet, bent down, and touched the stagnant blood that had collected in the gaping wound of the fallen soldier's back. It was warm. He then turned the corpse upwards to look for anyother signs of possible life...there were none. The knight layed there lifelesly, staring into the canopy of the forest through the eye slits of his helmet. Ariakane continued to focus on this one knight and then noticed the emblem etched into the chestplate of the armor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thedar d'Tagnik'zul,&quot; he said aloud. He rose to his feet and whispered, &quot; I must report this to the Head Of-,&quot; his words were haulted as he stood in shock. The helmet that was on the corpse was now missing and exposed the face of the knight...it was Ariakane's. He stared at the face in fear and watched as it shape-shifted...<br>
<br>
&quot;Ariakane! Wakie wakiez!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ariakane awoke suprisedly to find the Orkhalla's face projected into his vision. Rukkas grinned as he enjoyed startling his warrior, gaining pleasure like he always did from simple moments like this.<br>
<br>
&quot;What happened?&quot; Ariakane managed to speak, groaning while he stretched. The faded lights of the forest shined into the window, it was morning. Ariakane pulled his feet out of the bed and placed them on the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yus throwin ups las nitez. Yus mus hab thron up da previus nites dinnur as well! Hehehar!&quot; the ogre exclaimed. &quot;Uhparentleez yus don like da way Frakk cooks da fishees!! Mmmmm dat sauz wuz gud...&quot;<br>
<br>
Ariakane's stomached churned as he recalled the fish prepared by Frakk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Weez still gots mor if yus tink yus can handel it!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No thanks, perhaps Lady Lilya will be kind enough to prepare me breakfast.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was no response from Rukkas. He was obviously still thinking of last night's dinner.The ogre stared at the wall as pools of saliva began to amass in his mouth. Ariakane gave him a sharp kick to keep the ogre from overflowing in front oh him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mez sa-,&quot; Rukkas paused to swallow his fluids, &quot;Meez sawwy...whachu say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My meal,&quot; Ariakane responded, &quot;I am going to ask Lady Lilya to -&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She notz heer nowz,&quot; Rukkas addes sharply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh&quot; Ariakane's stomach once again began to rumble, as if it were begging him not to resort to Frakk's fish. &quot;Where is she?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Culd be anywhere,&quot; Rukkas stated. &quot;Almos all da Elders of da tribe gon on pursunal bizness,&quot; the ogre concluded sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well then...I guess I will go and make some breakfast and see how the day progresses.&quot; Ariakane made his way to the kitchen and called out to Rukkas, &quot;Want anything?!&quot; Rukkas happily jumped to his feet and hastily joined Ariakane in the kitchen.<br>
<br>
The meal was finished with Ariakane washing up and Rukkas licking the remaining sauces in his bowl with Ariakane's back to him. Ariakane sneaked a peek and smiled to himself thinking of how much of a child his leader was. But it was nothing he worried about for he enjoyed it, and he knew when the time came, he could always count on Rukkas to watch his back. Ariakane turned around, walked back to the table and discovered the Halfling slaves Ican and Feudil snickering at Rukkas, apparently at his 'table manners'. Ariakane scowled them before they dashed off to complete their tedious chores around the Severed Souls Hall. Rukkas patted his mouth with his cloth napkin like a child trying to act elegant and proper, but the fact that his meal was all over his face and table really ruined the effort.<br>

Sitting in his throne like chair in front of the fireplace, He studies the Insignia of the Nation of Eridine hanging over the mantle, surrounded by the weapons Trevalyn had used over the years.  All sharpened and clean.  There hung the forged Two-handed sword Lord Idan had made for him upon his arrival into the ranks of the Nation, The silvery twohanded axe he had used during his youth in the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule, the Dark reaver... the first of its kind on the world of Norrath, given to him by one of the greatest Knights to serve the Father, Deris, the Mithral Twohander and Deathbringers rod granted him by Emon Olath'Xukuth the Beguiller.  And in the center of them all, overtop a greatly adorned small metal box, sat a small rusty broadsword...still stained with the blood of an old aquantence.  <br>
<br>
     Trevalyn stared at the small rusty blood stained blade obsessively.  His eyes never moving from it.  Until a knock sounded from the door of his home, breaking him from the concentration.  He rose from his seat, adorning his civilian garb.  As he opened the door, he saw nothing.  Knowing who it was, he left the door open and went back to his seat.   Suddenly the door slammed shut and a small breeze went by Trevalyn.  Obviously someone has moved behind him.  <br>
<br>
     &quot;Show yourself to me gnome.&quot;<br>
<br>
     His order only answered with silence.  <br>
<br>
     &quot;show yourself gnome or i shall return you to the Tower of the Spurned to recieve your punishement.&quot;<br>
<br>
    At that moment a gnome materialized in front of Trevalyn, already on his knees begging his forgiveness speaking a mile a minute.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Im so sorry Knight Templar, i didnt mean to disreguard your order, i wouldnever do that i dont know how i could live, if it wasnt for your generaosity i definatle be dead or worse those tower of the spurned are cruel even comparably for dark elves i mean they really had it for me...&quot;<br>
<br>
     Trevalyn wearily rose a hand to silence the stuttering fool.  &quot;Silence.  have you completed the mission i have asked of thee?&quot; Trevalyn asked coldly as his eyes had found their focal point again on the rusty broad sword.<br>
 <br>
     The gnome fidgeted nervously, &quot;uhh, mission my Knight Templar?&quot;<br>
<br>
     Trevalyn let out a sigh of dissapointment as he removed a small flask from the cupboard which looked as if were filled with blood.  He removed its top and handed it to the confused gnome.<br>
<br>
     &quot;drink, small one&quot;<br>
<br>
     the gnome carefully studdied the bottle, &quot;umm..aye, Templar i will&quot;<br>
<br>
     The gnome slowly began to sip on the flask of blood.  As he did it began to flow with a blue light.  As the light grew brighter, the gnome drank greedier in larger gulps until the cask was empty.  Suddenly the gnomes form began to morph and glow.  The light became blinding in the room.  Trevalyn hardly noticed as he squinted a bit while never removing his gaze from the blade.  <br>
<br>
     As the light receeded, no longer was a gnome standing before Trevalyn... but a Teir'dal.  <br>
<br>
     Temptus took a breath and a sigh of relief he that he was released from his curse for a few moments thanks to the bottle of clarity ridden elder enchanters blood that Trevalyn gave him.  <br>
<br>
     &quot;Thankyou Templar.  I have completed the mission you asked of me.  I have reports and accurate accounts of the battle that has begun between Severed Souls and the cursed Emerald Phoenix.  I have also obtained vital information reguarding the Emerald Phoenix's ranks and strengths and weaknesses.  They felt no threat from the gnome around their ranks and bases of opperaton, nor could they see the eye watching them in battle as it was my sight binded to theirs.  It was... enlightening.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Trevalyn finally drew his gaze away from the blade, studying his servant.  &quot;And what would be your recommendation, Temptus?&quot;<br>
<br>
     &quot;I beleieve, Templar, that the Nation could benefit much from this war.  It began over a duo of fools from the Paleones and is slowly growing into a full fledged war.  I believe that our Dark bretheren the Severed souls and their orkhalla would benefit and even be welcome to our assistence.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Trevalyn raised an eyebrow at his servant. &quot;and did you meet with the Orkhalla?&quot;<br>
<br>
     &quot;I... attempted to, Templar.  But he was not privy to the knowledge of my true form.  I had to avoid... being eaten..&quot;<br>
<br>
     Trevalyn chuckled at the thought, much to the annoyance of his servant.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Come now Temptus.  You have succeeded in your mission perfectly.  And for that accomplishment, i shall give you another vile of the enchanter's blood.  You shall stave off your curse for another few days.  Now come, dictate this letter to the Orkhalla.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Vendui, Mighty Orkhalla Rukkas of the tribe Severed Souls,<br>
<br>
     Do not mind my servant as he may be in a fit of madness.  Please do not eat him, as he is not what he seems and his death would mean dire repercussions from Neriak.  I have a proposition which may be most beneficial for both our Tribes.  Return word with my servant.  And worry not, he knows the consequences for not obeying me no matter what form he may be in.  May we find eachother quickly.  Good hunting and may the father watch over the Severed Souls.<br>
<br>
Trevalyn Phliths'Elgluth<br>
Head of the Household of Phliths'Elgluth<br>
Buddon Dette Allore<br>
Knight Templar of the Nation of Eridine&quot;<br>
<br>
    &quot;Now get this letter to him as quickly as possible Temptus.  Not just quickly because of its importance, but because the supply of blood i gave you will not last more then a day or two.  move with haste.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Temptus scrolled the letter up avoiding his masters gaze.  &quot;Aye Templar, i shall move quickly&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
     Temptus quickly left the Templars home.  Trevalyn sat, quietly contemplating the events to come.  The flowing blood that will result would only be outdone by the screams of pain, terror, and hate as the Nation would ground its enemies into the ground.  At these thoughts, a smile came to his face.  Much glory indeed.  Trevalyn stood, put on his armor, picked up his weapon and made his way for the Eridani guildhall.  The first house would need to approve the plan, which he had no doubt they would.  <br>
<br>
     Much blood...much blood indeed..<br>

____________________________________________________________Continued from beginning....<br>
<br>
Ariakane chuckled at the ogre.<br>
<br>
&quot;You missed a small bit...right...there,&quot; Ariakane told him while pointing at the side of his mouth. Rukkas extended his tongue out and swiped the bits of sauce near his mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gotz it?&quot; Rukkas asked. Ariakane stared at Rukkas's sauce-covered face, laughing inside, keeping it hidden from Rukkas.<br>
<br>
Ariakane smiled, &quot;Yes Orkhalla, now clean up your bowl while I go check in with the remaining Souls.&quot; Rukkas nodded as he inhaled a jug of Bog Juice.<br>
<br>
Ariakane stepped out of the kitchen and glanced down the corridors, noticing it's vacancy. The hallway was dimly lit with a few candles lining the walls, and the sunlight that made its way from the Hall entrance. <br>
<br>
Ariakane began to walk towards the Souls Den Room when he heard a loud thump followed immediately by loud crashes.<br>
<br>
&quot;The kitchen.....Rukkas!&quot; Ariakane exclaimed as he quickly removed the dagger from his belt and proceeded to the kitchen. <br>
<br>
He reached the doorway and began to step in when he was greeted with an enormous growl from Rukkas that sent him to the ground. Feudil and Ican followed, tumbling into the wall outside the kitchen door.Ican scrambled to his feet and hurried to Feudil. He attempted to pick Feudil to his feet only to discover that he had been knocked unconscious. The top of Feudil's dripped with blood. <br>
<br>
Ican looked to Ariakane. He was dazed and phased out. He then dragged Feudil around the corner hastefully and began to tear and scratch at the collar that had been bound to his neck by the Souls.<br>
<br>
The collar had been cast upon by the Elders of the Severed Souls. It locked the channeling capabilities of its wearer. But the Souls were slightly merciful as they allowed the halflings to cast freely in their private rooms. They did however, seal all possible portals able to be summoned in that area.<br>
<br>
Ican continued to struggle with the collar strapped to his neck. He felt a small tear in the collar along the buckle as he lashed at it vigorously. He dug his nail into the slit as he successively ripped the collar off his neck. He felt a cool breeze course through his body as the ability to channel returned to him. Ican began to chant a prayer to Mother Tunare, as he began to restore consciousness to Feudil.<br>
<br>
Rukkas walked out of the kitchen, looking down the hallway, searching for the halfling slaves. He discovered Ariakane phased out on the ground, his head bobbing side to side, in a state of semi-consciousness...<br>
<br>
Ariakane found himself standing in the familiar vacant forest. He realized where he was...the battle site. He quickly turned around to find nothing. All the bodies that were once blotted all over the place, were gone. The fires were dying out and much of the smoke had escaped the forest.<br>
<br>
Ariakane walked around as he observed the mysterious environment that he had once again been brought to. He began to descend down a slope as he tripped over an exposed tree root. He tumbled down the slope, through bushes, vines, and more roots before he crashed into a large, solid object. He then picked himself up and discovered what laid before his feet. Rakkas's body.<br>
<br>
It appeared to have been mutilated. The exposed skin of the ogre had been singed by pelts of fire and blankets of frost. His armor had been so badly beaten with deformity, that the original texture and shape of it could never be figured. It was apparent that he had been involved in a slaughtering offensive, but from who or what? The wide and gaping wounds were everywhere on his body. The blood that was released from the cuts looked as if they blended with Rakkas's Sentient Armor. But Ariakane soon realized as he looked Rakkas up and down, that the armor did not blend in with the blood, but had been covered with a dry coat of Rakkas's own blood.<br>
<br>
Ariakane looked up to discover yet another surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rukkas...,&quot; Ariakane sadly whispered to himself. He hurried over to the bulk in the Totemic Armor, still grasping to his spear. His body was less severed than his brother's.<br>
<br>
Ariakane began to chant a prayer, but was interrupted as the sound of rustling brush sent Ariakane's hand to his side to find nothing. The dark elf cursed under his breath before he chanted the words to a spell and was washed away with shadows.<br>
<br>
Two figures stepped out of the faint mist that covered the forest floor. One of them was noticeably a gigantic barbarian who possessed the ability to channel the mana of shamans. He carried skulls, legs, tongues, and many other undesirables to common folk, all over him. The stench that he emitted was a warm mixture of fluids and gland sacs from creatures.<br>
<br>
Ariakane covered his nose and began to appreciate the fact that the tribal shamans in his guild ate most of the spell components they gathered instead of carrying them around.<br>
<br>
The other figure was one of a male, a sleek, well shaped, and defined half-elven. He stood with a great stature as he appeared to be reconning the area. His head slowly turned toward Ariakane's position and his mouth stretched to a soft smirk.<br>
<br>
Ariakane felt the icy stare pierce his soul as they caught eachother's glance. He had somehow discovered Ariakane among the shadows. Ariakane stared at the elf as he called out and motioned towards his position with his drawn sword...<br>
<br>
Nothing moved in the hall. It was quiet as ever and Ariakane could only remember vague events from his 'dream'. He leaned his head forward as he regained total consciousness. He looked down each way of the hall and found nothing peculiar at all. He then laid his head against the wall, closed his eyes, and released a heavy sigh.<br>
