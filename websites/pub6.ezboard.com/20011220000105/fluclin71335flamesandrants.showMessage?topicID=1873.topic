<br>
First off EQ is a group game, a game built on community, if someone/some classes are above this by being able to dictate when and what creature/mob they get to kill its unfair to the remainder of the community.  Nagafen is perdominantly taken down within 48 hours of the spawn time for a cleric epic, then you must wait several days for it to spawn again to go for any other epic.  During which time more often then not one person &quot;MAY&quot; stand a chance at getting there epic.<br>
<br>
Secondly when a cleric goes for there epic, they wish to kill Nagafen ASAP with little regard for other players who are trying to do other epics, such as paladins, bards, warriors, and possibly others.  The items when Naggy drops are often sent to any of the classes or those attending of the class, though they are not persuing their epic. <br>
<br>
Third it is noted that naggy drops a book, scale and these can be found off of other mobs as well, more often then not the higher level guilds farm these mobs will little regard for anyone who is trying to go for there epics.  That makes it virtually impossible to get your epic unless you either have a ton of high level friends or are in one of the guilds.  <br>
<br>
Fourth, Rage always hands out the epic for the cleric, this makes him a mob that is CERTAIN unlike the other epic mobs such as naggy.  Rage can pop up to 3 times during the naggy down time and during that rotation more often then not 2 clerics get there epics, while others have to fight over a single scale, paladin book, etc...<br>
<br>
Fifth people say the cleric epic is the best epic in the game because its a &quot;click stick&quot;.  Regardless of whether its the best, all players deserve the chance to go for there epics, clerics should not be able to dictate when a mob is killed.  With the list they are doing that with no regard for other players or the community in general.<br>
<br>
***ADDED***<br>
<br>
I believe that there should be a epic list for Bards, Paladins, Warriors and who ever else needs it to coincide with the Cleric list so that more people stand a chance at obtaining epics rather then just an individual class.   The list of course would be based on the person having all items up to a specific point at which time they need the piece from either naggy or rage.  Clerics should not be singled out like this becasue that unbalances the system.<br>
<br>
For those of you who think that the Cleric epic is hard, Check out the Warrior, Mage, Paladin, Bard or most other epics.  Mages have to go on constant Hate raids for ultrarare Staff drops off rare mob, 8th isle of air, and do Phinagel about 30 times before they get the staffs they require.  Paladins have to get the books from Naggy / Vox which drop 1/10 and are competing with a lot of others there.  Warriors and bards both need the scales from naggy, so if you do manage to get to go to Naggy and it does drop (RARE) the chances of you getting it is even rarer due to the number of warriors / bards there.  Most classes get held up for a lot longer then clerics do on the waiting list.  Clerics not only have a easier epic they dont have to contend so much with others of the class for each drop.  So when a cleric camps a specific camp such as rage, they reduce the chance of those going for that epic to get the items they require.<br>
<br>
True the Cleric epic is very usefull, true that Naggy should die fast. But there should be a list for the epic dragons. If you have been on the cleric list a few more hours wont kill you and it may help Warriors / Bards / Paladins that have been waiting for months to get thier epics.<br>
<br>
The argument that I have heard from clerics is they keep the party alive, well guess what, Warriors / Paladins / Bards keep you alive as well.. ALL ARE NEEDED <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usaldren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saldren</A> at: 11/16/01 9:14:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufayenae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fayenae</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gyrating Goo</span><br>  Posts: 535<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/16/01 8:07:08 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/jzallen01/Fayenae/FayeVelium.jpg WIDTH=80 HEIGHT=201></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Breaks 3 Epics</span><hr size=1> I will leave the explanations up to people who are willing to type more.<br>

I've even been to a few pick-up Rage killings where warriors and bards got to roll on redscale.  Without the list, only the power gamers would get their epic.  With the list, pieces are spread around.<br>

Well obviously those dragons are easier than the other sources of scales will be your reply.  <br>
<br>
But look down the road at another part of your epic you WILL have to eventually complete.  Warriors have to get the GREEN scale as well.  Guess what...in order to get the green scale your guild or &quot;high level friends&quot; will have to kill Sevrilious or if you're in a really great guild Hoshkar (only LOS has done this on this server I believe).  So for warriors in order to get the green scale you have to have almost sufficient force to take out the other 2 more readily accessible sources of the red dragon scale, Talendor and the Scalekeeper in the hole.<br>
<br>
For bards, yes its easier to get your white and red scales from Naggy and Vox but guess what...for your last step you've gotta take out a spawned version of the dragon Trakanon.  From what I understand he is slightly easier than the regular version, but not terribly easier.  In order to do this step you're guild or &quot;high level friends&quot; will have to kill an extremely difficult mob...probably tougher than Talendor, but easier than Gorenaire.<br>
<br>
The only reasonable arguments I can see would be from paladins, but from my experiences the books are extremely rare drops from Naggy and Vox, but relatively common from Gorenaire and Talendor.  Why make yourself suffer through countless naggy/vox raids, crippling yourself from leveling past 52 for a 1 and 10 drop rate when you can level up, do Talendor and Gorenaire for a 1 in 2 drop rate?<br>
<br>
Yes Naggy and Vox are easier sources of these scales, but in order to COMPLETE the epics you will need to take on and defeat mobs as tough or tougher than the other sources of these scales.  I have no problem with the cleric list the way it is because it makes sure Nagafen is down quickly and we get more sprinklers on the server.  Other epics are important, but I don't know how anyone can argue that the cleric epic doesn't have the most direct effect on the guild/friends/server that the individual who completes it has and is on.<br>
<br>
Level up, have fun, and make friends.  You'll get your epic one day when you least expect it.<br>

Too much fluff in there.  If you're saying that you can't get your red scales because naggy dies as soon as he pops, you're completely wrong.  90% of the clerics on the ragefire list make their naggy raid OPEN which means EVERYONE can attend, and they usually let people roll on the scale.  If anything, the ragefire list should be considered a boon to warriors/bards trying to get their scales because naggy dies fast, which means more pops.  If you're asking to do the rest of your epic, then have people hand you a scale because you're done with the rest, I suggest you get off your ass and work for it.  Nothing is free.<br>

Talendor is also in a higher level and much more risky area, you fail to take these things into concideration.  As for the scale keeper he is farmed left right and center.  <br>
<br>
Bards have it a bit lighter, Vox isnt as camped as much as other dragons simply because her lair is hell to get into with those traps.   But again if you get the scale from vox what point is there without the one from naggy, you are competeing with an endless supply of warriors and other bards, not to mention when a cleric hopes a raid, as Aezon stated its OPEN, therefore nothing is RESERVED.  More often then not since the scale is ALL ALL everyone rolls on it then you see it being sold in East commons and hour or so later.   <br>
<br>
Paladins have it rough though, and it becomes rougher as they progress simply becuase they cant attend naggy or vox to get the book after 53, so what then you expect to raid skyfire constantly in hopes of getting it or wait on gore and get KSed but a higher lvl guild(happens)?<br>
<br>
The way the cleric list stands it makes other epics such as paladins, warriors, bards that much harder to get while if they were a bit patient perhaps instead of the hustle and bustle they could perhaps allow other classes a chance at getting the epic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also in regards to Aezons post, 90 % of the clerics make the ragefire open, thats true, but epic items are more often then not kept intra guild simply because you wish to help your guild members progress.  As for my epic, i have done everything myself, sponsored naggy raids and so forth, yet I get KSed by clerics who cant wait 8 hours because rage &quot;Might&quot; pop.  It is something you have to live with but if there were a list and if the scale did drop or book did drop it would enable that class to get part of there epic inside of a random person whom doesnt want to go for or have any pieces of the epic.<br>
<br>
You have to be fair to your fellow players, and downing naggy the way the list does isnt fair to any of those players that play specific classes.<br>

Sorry, but you can't even TRY to compare the usefullness of a cleric with epic over the usefullness of a pally or even bard with epic.<br>
<br>
I mean, i suppose if i played one of those classes i might care more, but i don't.<br>
<br>
Simply put if im forming up a group and i have a choice between<br>
a. a level 60 cleric and a level 60 pally with epic<br>
or<br>
b. a level 60 cleric with epic and a level 60 pally<br>
<br>
Guess which one im choosing ?<br>
Simply put the cleric epic helps EVERYONE around the cleric, where as the pally epic helps only the pally, and the bard epic helps just the group the bard is with.<br>
<br>
Yes, i know that last comment was a great generalization, but i stand by it.<br>

Basiclally, quit yer whining.<br>

Sure, cleric epics are a great boon to the server at large, but besides that the list simply makes sense for that particular mob.<br>
You're confusing the issues a little, yes scales and books are hard to get, but they are supposed to be. As you hit 50, start doing as many Vox/Naggy raids as you can, maybe you will get lucky.<br>
If not, move on.. the drops can be bought by multi, or scales are sometimes sold by guilds that camp the Nortlav for the plat. And that's your options -if- you are not in a guild that can do them theirselves, or have friends that can help you get it.<br>

More dead Naggy = More epic pieces for everybody.  These huge guilds you're talking about that are capable of dropping Naggy actually don't have as easy a time as you think rounding up people who are under level 53, and you'd be hard-pressed to find anybody doing Nagafen in-house.<br>

You may be adversely affected by the cleric rotation, but for every person that is unhappy with the way it's being done, I can point to dozens who didn't need a large guild or any connections to get their book or scale, simply because the rotation exists.  Show up, offer your services, and away you go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubicrius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bicrius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I need a beer</span><br>  Posts: 4304<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/16/01 1:53:32 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://students.hamilton.edu/2002/bschulte/eqpics/bic_gin_sm.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Breaks 3 Epics</span><hr size=1> Let's put Phinny on a rotation for mages and wizards.

Now I've offered for CoS to kill him tonight and have first rights but....I'm not going to leave him up tonight if I can help it.  Am I wrong?  Would the other 40 some clerics be happy to add a day to the camp?  I'm kinda stuck, either I kill him to speed the list along which is what I'm supposed to do and look like an ass to some folks or I wait till tommorrow night and risk the rage rotation looking at me like an ass.  Do we see the problem?  I will be doing everything in my power to get Naggy down tonight and hopefully it can be led by CoS and everyone will be happy.

This is the same calender that says &quot;Plane of growth, hate, air, and fear only&quot;, right?  As far as I'd be concerned, that reservation doesn't even exist.  Read the calender rules before you use it.  *shrug* ; )  (btw, not poking at you, Vysion, I'm poking at them)<br>
<br>
Personally, I think every rotation should be dropped except for the ragefire rotation.  Do you really think that things would be civil among clerics if the ragefire list was dropped?<br>
<br>
The way I see it, you're asking other people to set up a rotation because you are unable to get it yourself.  You're unable to get it because you aren't in an uber guild.  News flash - if you can't do your epic with your guild, you either a) don't get the epic b) make friends with some people in uber guilds or c) switch guilds.  Epics aren't meant to go to everyone.  Accept that, deal with it, and move on already.<br>

Yes, Talendor dies pretty much when he spawns but guess what...so does Sevrilious.  Why are you only worrying about one of the scales when the more difficult of the two to get you'll need help for too?  <br>
<br>
The force necessary to take down Sevrilious is probably sufficient to take down Talendor.  Also you can purchase red scales for approximately 25k...you can't touch a green dragon scale for under 100k if you can even find one for sale.  I don't understand why you're putting yourself into such a tiszy about an easy part when there are much more diffucult parts out there.  <br>
<br>
Let me repeat...for the warrior epic there are 3(!) sources for the red scale.  If you can't get naggy, go do the scalekeeper.  Can't get him go do Talendor.  And for your info the scalekeeper isn't taken down nearly as regularly as Talendor.  Play the game, have fun, level up.  Make friends and eventually with hard work and dedication your epic will come.  Even if it doesn't come, think of all the fun you had during the journey. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usaldren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saldren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/16/01 3:46:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Breaks 3 Epics</span><hr size=1> So theoretically you are isolating a mob in game which is meant for multiple people to kill to a group of people whom require it for there quest.  The game is built on sharing and helping one and other &quot;community&quot; the word seems to have eluded many of you.  How are you helping another person by saying &quot; I have to kill naggy now&quot;  when they have organized a raid and find out that a mere 4 or 5 hours prior a cleric has gone in an snuffed a mob you had setup to kill weeks prior.  Thats just downright mean, simply because they cant wait, what a load of junk.  Epics are about patience, clerics most definitely dont have it if they have to resort to 'He must die withing 48 hours' its like, why? simply because there epic is at stake.   I mean others spend months, some even a year or so trying to get there epic, yet clerics can get there epics much sooner then others.  As for aezon's comments, not everyone wants to be in a uber guild, some people are happy with the ones they are with and the friends they have.<br>
<br>
Stryke there are dozens of people who have waited months on end for there epics, clerics should be no different in that regard for things like the scale.  Within a month 8 clerics get there epics, how often do you see 8 Bards, Paladins, Mages, or Warriors get there epic within a month?  And of course these huge guilds have a hard time since there mininum is usually 55 or so.  When they do host the raid they usually give away the epic piece to someone <br>
<br>
A) who isnt doing  the epic and intends to make mass profit off the piece <br>
<br>
B) someone who has no intention of doing the epic because it is too painstaking <br>
<br>
C) someone who has worked long and very hard for there epic.  <br>
<br>
C happens VERY rarely and even if you tell the raid leader how close you are, its more often then not &quot;everything will be rolled on, no items are reserved&quot; simply because its naggy and not say Rage, who always drops the item required by clerics.  If someone were to kill rage and just hand out the rage part everyone would be in a hissy fit.  So why is it any different for the other epics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usaldren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saldren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/16/01 3:49:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Breaks 3 Epics</span><hr size=1> Vallaran as i said before, the GREEN scale is FARMED just like the red used to be before they put in the gate solution.

Is that red scale going to sit in your bank forever because you don't have the high level friends or guild to kill Sevrilious?  The point I'm trying to make is in order to kill Sevrilious, the force you'll have to gather is at least as much as you'll need for Talendor.  <br>
<br>
If you think that by putting up a reservation system for all the dragons you mentioned, you'll be able to host open raids for Sevrilious I laugh at you.  You'll have to rely on your friends/guildmates to get the green scale no matter what happens, even if it DID go to a list.  <br>
<br>
The way things go now...you want one of these mobs, you get there first when they spawn.  I'm in the type of guild a list would &quot;help&quot; and I think they're bad ideas unless another solution can not present itself.  I think first come first served on these dragons is a reasonable solution.  <br>
<br>
Everquest whether you like it or not is a social game.  Make friends and your friends will want to help you.  Make friends and when Sevrilious and Talendor are up, your friends will help you.  You don't have to be in an uber guild.  Meshugugget(sp?)  has her light sabers and she was in one of the smallest guilds on the server.  <br>
<br>
No matter which way you cut this, you're going to have to rely on friends and guildmates to get your epic.  My friends will drop what they're doing to help me, and I'm sure most people's friends are the same.  &lt;3 my friends in EQ!<br>

If there is anyone you should be angry at, it is me. I posted the rules that the Luclin cleric community now follows for the Ragefire List, made possible only because every major guild capable of breaking the list has instead chosen to follow it.<br>
<br>
Luclin's Ragefire Rotation list is not like other rotations, (Trak, VS, etc) where a critter can pop a few times a week, is pretty easily killed, and drops items which are considered to be highly desirable. Im most rotations, usually the guild capable of killing the critter agree to share, and rotate turns, or they go FFA.<br>
<br>
However, the Ragefire bottleneck is one of the worst of its kind in the game. Its a random easy-to-kill 1-3 day spawn that is seen as so valuable that the cleric is forced to camp it solidly. Yes, that means literally staring at the wall, killing Fire Giants, for days, instead of dropping by Hate or Fear every once in a while to see if today's your lucky day. <br>
<br>
Sure, there are other epic bottlenecks, Warriors need the green scale (I do not consider the red scale a bottleneck, because for any warrior capable of finding the support to down Sev and get a wing blade, the red scale is laughably easy to get). Paladins need books, bards need the white scale.<br>
<br>
The difference, however, is demand. This situation doesnt really impact warriors and bards, because the red scale, in comparison to their true bottlenecks (green and white, plus queen/spiroc blades for warriors, and trak for bards), is easy to get. In each and every single case that I've known a warrior or bard to be pretty close to finishing, they always have had the red scale taken care of, from frequent naggy raids, to ragefires, to the scalekeeper, to Talendor. Some guilds have been known to have an extra leftover red scale or two, even.<br>
<br>
No, this situation truely only affects Paladins. Unlike Warriors and bards, it IS possible, if your lucky or dedicated, to get a pally epic without too much difficulty as far as major dragon slaying is concerned, if they are lucky early in life. It used to be where a paladin could lead naggy/vox raids every week, reserving the book for themself (oddly enough, in this old system, the red scale was still randomed in a paladin raid ; ) ). Now, they can still do this, the paladin just needs to have the leadership skills and the ability to rally other players to their cause to a more flexible timetable, before the waiting cleric decides the dragon wont fall that night without their intervention. Whats the impact here? A paladin now doesnt have quite the cakewalk road ahead of them, of killing Naggy whenever the hell they feel like it, if they have made the decision to not level past 52.<br>
<br>
Thats the negative impact that I see. Overall, paladins have a slightly harder time of it. On the other end, you have a class which is far more played. (Luclin.org has clerics in the 46-60 level range outnumbering paladins roughly 300 to 150) This class's epic is rediculously more powerful, has more of an impact on the community, and is a more guild-driven must-have item for the life or death of raids, than any other class. In fact, with the possible exception of warrior light sabres, there is NO epic thats really pushed for by the major guilds, all other class epics is more prestige, neat-to-have items, to show the world how strong they are. The cleric epic is something the major guilds would decide is important enough to declare all-out war over. Yes, in a utopia it would be nice if all epics were created equal, no one stepped on each other, and all classes sang together at the campfire, but they arent. To ignore this is to ignore reality. If you dont like it, I'm sorry, but the server as a whole has made the decision that adding an extra hassle to the paladin community (or if you insist, a very, very minute tiny hassle to bards and warriors, but again, at the end of the epic, its never the red scale that proves difficult to achieve for them), is far outweighed by ensuring the most rapid influx of the extremely precious and valuable cleric epic, as much as possible. <br>
<br>
For the moment, I'll just ignore the very valid arguement that more and faster naggy slayings = more pally and warrior/bard epic pieces floating out in the world, and just assume that paladins are still somehow hurt in some way.<br>
<br>
Finally, this leads to the last point, and a very strong arguement that preserves the list. If you want to see a Ragefire Rotation List of ANY KIND at ALL, you go to Luclin. This does not exist anywhere else in this entire game. There's a reason that we are carefully different. We saw what happens with Rage in other servers, and frankly we dont like what we see. Essentially, the list is not only an agreement between the Luclin cleric community, but because it is so guild-driven, and because it cant be possible without universal consent from the major guilds, its also an unofficial &quot;political agreement&quot; between the major guilds, to be fair as possible and prevent the ugliness that occurs everywhere else.<br>
<br>
In Luclin, guilds sometimes bicker at each other. One might leap over another's Gore raid, or make fun of a guild's 5th wipeout to Sev. At the end of the week though, there are no long-lasting hatreds. In luclin one guild irritates another, there's a grudge that lasts a week or two maybe, and it dies down. Most guilds are civil to each other, and occasionally are friendly to one another. Hell, sometimes we even praise LoS without hatred! (Try to find any love at ALL on other servers for a NToV and sleeper-capable guild, they are usually despised by all but applicants) This is an exception, not the rule for everquest servers that are older than a year and a half, and a major reason is Ragefire. In other servers, friendships between large guilds are unheard of. When one guild ticks off another, sooner or later, a Ragefire incident will fan those flames higher, untill they reach a point where a large guild no longer remembers a time when they werent pissed off at most of the other large guilds. <br>
<br>
In other servers, Ragefire is a lightning rod for conflicts, the seed for new hatred to begin and grow, and SolB is the battlefield for wars. In Luclin, clerics have to camp for up to 3 days when their turn is up. On other servers, if you claim the camp, there is one and only one way to make sure you will get it, and that's to have your entire guild focused on it, staking out Solb as that guild's territory, and camping it with you. Forget individuals and little guilds, on other servers, a small guild wins a cleric epic rarely. Everywhere but Luclin, and newbie servers, Ragefire is a plaything for the largest guilds. <br>
<br>
Think about your guild, and the fun you have day to day doing different things. Now, think how badly it would suck for you guild to be forced into shutting down operations so that 3 groups can share the fun of mind-numbing boredom in SolB, staring at walls, killing fire giants, chasing off other guild's clerics 24/7 who check the camp, and doing nothing for days to make sure that this time they arent KSed for the 4th time in a row. Yes folks, on other old servers, it has gotten to the point where accepted practice is, you do not truely own the camp for sure unless you have a couple strong groups with you at all times. :P I've experienced my own little hell of a 12-day camp when the server kept coming down on me for a whole week. I wouldnt want to inflict that camp on my friends, too.<br>
<br>
You decide, on another server, to try camping it without your friends anyway? It gets a bit more interesting. Ragefire pops, it is a foot-race to solb. Some guilds will honor the fact that you put in the camp-time, others who remember the times they were KS'd wont care less, and shrug at the thought that your 3 days of camping are on the line here. After all, they have suffered in the eternal Ragefire conflict, too. You mass a small force, barely capable of killing Rage just as uber_guild03 is steamrolling there way on up. If you wait, you lose, so you risk it and hand in the pearl. Here's the real kicker. If a paladin or warrior or bard loses a fight, or gets ksed, they can whine about it, and then they can try again later. A cleric, by turning in the pearl is putting their entire progress on the line, all the camping in Lake Rathe, all the camping in Sola, the epic fights in Chardok and Burning Woods, camping Ragefire himself for 2-3 days, if you lose to Rage, you start completely over at the beginning. Sometimes, guilds have even been known to KS a spawned Ragefire, forcing the cleric who put in the camp time to start all over so that their cleric can have an epic without doing hardly any work instead.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid its going to take a little more than paladin inconveniance, or making it easier to stake out a naggy raid where you reserve your very own easy-to-get red scale, to convince us to risk the above possible future. <p>Cayleu Starshine
