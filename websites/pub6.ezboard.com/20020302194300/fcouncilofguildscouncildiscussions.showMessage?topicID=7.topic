<br>
I think that we should get together and come up with a set of procedures or protocols to prevent disagreements and/or handle disputes. Some of these might be taken care of, but others are not.<br>
<br>
For instance:<br>
If RPing where hostility arises via RP, the persons should also send tells to affected parties to make sure that it isn't personal, but rather an attempt at roleplaying. I've seen instances where people get into arguments or name calling, but are really just in a state of roleplaying opposing race/classes. This may prevent some players from taking true offense at what is said and to understand that it is roleplaying, because the people around who are addressed may not be roleplaying.<br>
<br>
Respect of space: Here, we might address issues of camping as X space or area. Sometimes people choose to camp an area off to the side of a camp instead of on the &quot;campfire&quot;, which may or may not cause disputes. This is just an example of what we can establish as a *common understanding*. Some people believe that you don't *own* a spawn, where others believe in the first there, first owned rule. I think that if we get a common protocol, we can avoid disputes. Obviously, these aren't binding rules, but a set of guidelines that may prevent misunderstandings in the future. If it gets past that point, then it is between the parties involved.<br>
<br>
Some protocols may not be effective for all guilds. For instance, there may be guilds out there that condone killstealing or other activities that we may not favor as a majority. This does not mean that we don't establish a way of conflict handling. Such as...<br>
1. Direct tells to the group leaders or persons to keep it a private matter vs OOC or SHOUT fighting.<br>
2. Encouragement of mature calm discussion and spirit of compromise.<br>
3. If tempers are too hot, take a break before resuming discussion.<br>
4. Take it to the guild officers or leaders.<br>
etc.<br>
If this were posted, it might keep the number of shout and ooc fighting down, which is always a good thing. Also, it gives a sense of process to people instead of a general sense of hopeless yelling at one another.<br>
I think that the Council should get together and come up with Generally Accepted Principles of Conflict Resolution or something like that.<br>

<br>
Umm.. the way I understand the “vision” of the Council of Guilds, it says that this is not a governing body in the issues you described. It (as I read it) is to assist each other, plan events, communicate better with each other as we are now doing, make allies and new friends.<br>
<br>
The issues you describe are legitimate but in these cases I think that what Haemish stated should be the council’s practice. It should be the responsibility of the guilds involved reconciling such things independently as they happen and should not involve the Council as a body or as a “law maker”.<br>
<br>
I understand your desire for a “common” understanding or practice on these issues but I do not think the Council was made to create and enforce rules of any kind.<br>
<br>
Maybe an agreement that everyone practices “courtesy” communicating with each other but THAT should be how we are anyway as people, players and roleplayers.<br>

I'm not saying it is a law or legally enforceable by anyone. The POINT I'm trying to make is that so far, NOBODY has discussed any issues that can be furthered here. Enlightenment.<br>
<br>
We don't need a council to just start events that are already occurring. Events between guilds can also be addressed here or between the guilds themselves. If you think that I'm proposing rules, you're wrong.<br>
<br>
A point I disagree with you strongly is that we all maturely try to solve things. People have different ideas of what mature is. Also, between cultures, there are different ideas of how such things are taken care of. If anything, never ASSUME that everyone is on the same page. It's much better to have a discussion about this to see how everyone feels about an issue. The issue I put up as example is one of them. Some might feel that involving guild officers is inappropriate, while others might always involve guild officers. There are many more different situations, but there should be a common understanding. If we don't TALK about it here, then some people may think guildwar is the only way of solving something that started between two individuals over something stupid.<br>
<br>
Once again, the emphasis is on *communication*. THIS is communication. I don't think hammering out ideas on procedures is LAW because I haven't mentioned punishments or consequences. I have just proposed in my example ideas on how to AGREE on issues. If you think that we all think the same thing, then you are wrong. If you disagree with my hypothetical list, then that is prime example of the need to have an open discussion about what is commonly accepted or not. Sure, you don't have to do anything you don't want to, but I'm flexible enough to go through a process because it is a common ground.<br>
<br>
This type of disagreement was common during the birth of the United States as some favored a Confederacy vs Federal government. Just pointing out without a common language to go with, we won't get anywhere on communication. If there are other issues regarding our server, so be it. I'm open to anything, but it's a lot better than all talking about solving problems and not actually working to fix them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/25/00 11:58:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Etiquette</span><hr size=1> A good beginning to the discussion, Deodrid.

<br>
I would agree we should discuss some options here. We all have to deal with each other when one of our members is accused of killstealing. We all must decide where our individual guilds stand on such issues. Our charters are meant to tell our members what we think about such actions. <br>
<br>
But what does the council think? What are some of the issues we need to discuss?<br>
<br>
Are there any guilds where kill-stealing is NOT frowned upon? <br>
What guilds exist purely for roleplay and purely for fun? And do most of us fall in the middle somewhere? <br>
<br>
As guild leaders, how much or how little control should we/do we exert over our guilds?<br>

The Council of Guilds whether they want to or not must, at some point, have to deal with governing over matters that Deo stated above about handling disputes.  It doesn't have to law, but guilds need to know that if they plan on raiding with CoG,there are guildlines that must be followed or they won't be raiding with the CoG anymore.<br>
EQ has evolved...the Alliance and the CoG will soon become governing Factors as far as Guilds are concerned.  I fret at the day the some guilds get together and form an EQ version of the Empire, and I only hope that the CoG are the rebels <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But anyway, the CoG must be ready to step foward and be able to take a stand when problems arise.<br>
<br>
As for the Roleplaying thing...I would not recommend that when RP with others you send private tells to say your just RPing.  Instead...tack on at the end of your ooc...&quot;RPing&quot;..why?  Because all the idiots out there that feel they need to add their two cents when your RPing with another guild.  This way you dont start a shouting match by everyone in the zone.<br>
<br>
On the subject of Guild officers...that is their job.  To handle disputes between members of thier guild and with members of other guilds.  Personnaly..in the KotCT (knights of the crystal tear) I would not want the non-officers shooting their mouths off to other guilds about KSing/camp stealing or whatever.  Some one steals your kill...you ask nicely incase it was a mistake...they do it again...you inform your guild officer and let them handle it.<br>
<br>
There was something else...but I rambled to long to remember it. hehehe.. <br>

I do not think that time will ever come.  I believe that the vision of the CoG is a place for guilds to come together and get support for and hold events.  Events of all shapes, sizes and natures.<br>
<br>
As I understand how things stand now, the person or group who runs each particular event sets the rules for that event.  They set how lottos will be done, they set how discipline will be dealt with, etc.  The Sacred Band's lotto rules might be different from Zellex's, or the Fellowship of Faydark's...etc.  I think that banning people should be handled in much the same way.  It's the right and responsibility of the raid commander and/or their managing body.  If someone is banned from one group's raids, then the others should be informed...but I don't think it's right to set a standard and hold everyone in the CoG to it.<br>
<br>
I think that would take away some of the individuality of groups that want to lead raids.  I'd much rather see each leader be responsible for discipline problems on their own raids.  We can definately communicate about such problems, and should...but aside from offenses that are banable, I don't think the CoG should be in the position of saying &quot;No, you can't come to this raid.&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub68.ezboard.com/uplangstrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>P Langstrump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(2/19/01 4:58:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interlog.com/~wings/jane/a_lindgren/lindgren_pics/pippi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Etiquette</span><hr size=1> There is already a lot of pressure put on the few people who are willing to spend time and efforts keeping this alive.

If people want to form their own power version of an empire, you know what will happen? I will quit this game, with no regret.<br>
<br>
All I would expect to see here is what constitutes a right to kick someone off of a CoG raid and blacklist him/her.  Basically:<br>
- ninjalooting<br>
- kill stealing<br>
- verbal abuse and disrespect to any individuals in a public way, such as racist, sexist or derogatory remarks shouts or OOCs directed at a person<br>
- blatant use of means that results in harming the rest of the group at an event, that is, purposefully causing deaths or loss of equipment<br>
