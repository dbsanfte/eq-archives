<br>
Except they didn't do that... they sat at zone in. We called Drusella first, which is not the same thing as the East Wing. Are you arguing that our claim is the valid one, then?<br>

<br>
I'd say what small minded people to call something and then invest NOTHING in it then expect it to be there an hour later when half the server wants that drop. If they had entered the camp, they'd have a leg to stand on. Had they entered the camp, this discussion wouldn't have happened. If you want something, be sure to WORK for it, not up and leave for an hour then come back expecting it to be yours while it sits untouched.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Rixma, Sulpicious, and Vortigern called the camp.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Incorrect, two of them are the same person. So two people called the camp. Then one left. *shrug* So one person still had claim on the camp. An hour later, he was still piddling with entrance spawns and hadn't entered the camp. Do you think Restless Burrower / Vindi / Chardok Royals / (Drusella) / any similar acknowledged race mob is going to be respected if one guild with six people calls it as forty more of another guild zone in? If you have the force, you WORK for your kill. If you don't WORK for your kill, then explain to me why you're entitled to it if both parties haven't come to an agreement?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sulpicious was busying himself killing some in the wing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Let me refamiliarize you with HS. There are four wings. Each has a door to the entrance area (only east is unlocked) and the entrance area leads to a one-way drop. Past that one way drop is the wing. You can go from Zone In to East Entrance area in about 30 seconds, or a few minutes if you clear the 7 required mobs. From there you can kill the six mobs in the East Entrance area... then you can ENTER the East Wing, or sit there in ZONE IN. He did the latter. If you call Frenzy from zone-in and sit there for an hour killing floor spawns, how long do you think people are going to take you seriously? Especially if half of your group leaves?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Typically when one calls a camp, one thinks that it's fairly secure from invasions on this server. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
True. They also typically begin camping said camp within a spawn cycle, not sit at zone in for an hour. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sulpicious probably could have gone on into the &quot;prime&quot; camp,&quot; as it's been put, and started killing there but, darn his greedy hide, he was going to wait for his friends to join him in the fun so he killed some wanderers and a few static mobs near the beginning of the camp.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If he doesn't want his camp, then I'll happily take it. If he wants it, he can camp it. An hour is certainly enough consideration on that account.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Maybe we hold higher standards for consideration of people and tolerance in my guild, but unless those people at the camp left or actively relinquished the camp to me somehow, I simply would have acknowledged their intent on the camp as they stated--without having to see for myself or time their performance--and moved on to do something else instead of hovering around them to swoop in if they messed up. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well see there's the rub. This isn't about a camp, this is about the mob Drusella. They could have easily camped East with us sitting at Drusella's spawn (which we called first, one of those tiny little facts that people overlook) for the hour we waited. We'd take six spawns of a total of maybe 30 in the wing. Their group had no more than half our DPS even after it was fully assembled, I wouldn't put money on them keeping the entire wing clear. Evaluation of forces = We can camp Drusella and they can still have the wing. Why did Rixma not ask me whether this was acceptable? I'll go out on a limb here - because she wanted Drusella. Why was she not actively camping Drusella? I don't know. I would have been camping a spawn that rare that I knew would pop. I don't really understand why she would leave, even to help someone, when it's going to take her an hour and her camp is going to rot untouched... the &quot;East Wing&quot; camp was left alone after our initial clear, we camped out at Dru's spawn point. She came up and sat around while yelling at me in tells and threatening me with my guild leader. Did she work for the spawn we called first in the wing she called but didn't actually enter until an hour afterward, with her group STILL at zone in? _no_.<br>
<br>
Maybe I've just been moderator for too many petty disputes like this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey! I called the TV! Now he's watching it!&quot;<br>
&quot;But then you went to the store for a half hour.&quot;<br>
&quot;But it was on my channel!&quot;<br>
&quot;If you wanted the TV, why did you go to the store? If you wanted to assure it would remain yours, why didn't you make sure beforehand that it was understood that it was yours instead of leaving without checking?&quot;<br>
&quot;But it's MIIINE&quot;<br>
&quot;If you want something, invest some in it next time. Sorry hun.&quot;<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Does this make me an asshole? I suppose the use of Logic, Facts, and Realism all at once is a little asseholish of me. So I'll reiterate:<br>
<br>
I am sorry if I hurt your feelings.<br>

Facts are nice things to use once in a while.</span><hr size=1> I thought I'd throw my cents around.<br>
<br>
Here's what I understand of the situation.  Clan X zones in, moves 20-30 feet towards the east wing, (over the pit, and past the 2 guards) and may or may not have been killing the mobs there.  LoM zones in, 2 Clan X memberm claim the Drus camp. (which they were not in.)  LoM goes through South wing, taking at <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> least</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> half an hour, during which time Rixma runs to chardok on foot, (10 minutes each way, including time spent <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> in</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> chardok) 1 Clan X member is still claiming Drus camp.  LoM decides that that single Clan X member has neither the means nor intent to take the Drus camp, and swoops in to take it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> If</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> this series of events is correct, (I wasn't there- just reconstructing) most importantly the part about Clan X not being in Drus camp for over half an hour, and not clearing towards it, then LoM had <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> every</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> right to do what they did.  LoM's actions were neither illegal according to VI's PnP nor mean or immoral according to the Rathe's unwritten rules on laying claim to a camp, nor were they contrary to common sense and human decency.<br>
<br>
You can ask a person in a parking lot to please hold a parking space for your friend who should be here &quot;soon(tm)&quot; but if that person takes the spot <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> half an hour</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> later when your friend still hasn't shown up, well, that sucks for you, but calling them inhuman and lacking human decency is is lunacy.<br>
<br>
But anyway- if my understanding of the situation is incorrect, tell me where I was wrong. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

I win the argument.  Whatever it was originally about, or whoever is mad or flamed who.  I win.  Doesn't matter.  <br>

<br>
Sorry but I wasn't there and neither was about 95% of the guild. Don't say we did something when we did not. Got an issue with a group, take it up with that group and not the guild.<br>
<br>
My view, I would have done the same thing Ssarvhok did. You don't have enough people to go sit on Drusella for over an hour then don't expect the camp. <p>Sorceress of the Rathe
