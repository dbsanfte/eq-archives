I wanted to see how much spin you could dish out.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So in synopisis, because a moron (sadam), used a popular religion to forward his dwindling popularity you felt the overwhelming need to criticize a whole religion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nice spin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nowhere in your little quote fest did you show me where the government forces the people to be Muslim.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No I didn't.  Nowhere did I say the government doesn't force them either.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You said something about the government not tolerating fundamentalism, but what does that mean?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, I quoted the article.  Maybe someone else can explain that better than me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I know they use that as an excuse to murder Kurdish people in the north, that is really political and not really the reason.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Opinion.  Nice spin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I never said they are perfect or even good at being tolerant of other religions, i said &quot;is one of the few middle eastern governments that actually tolerates religious freedom&quot;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And I never accused you of that saying that either.  Nice spin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is a strong Christian presence in Iraq, dipshit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
From Worlds Facts and Figures.com (2001 data)<br>
<br>
Iraq: Muslim 97% (Shi'a 60%-65%, Sunni 32%-37%), Christian or other 3%<br>
<br>
Other can include the Baath party.<br>
<br>
Even if the Christian religion comprised all 3%, which it doesn't, I don't consider 3% a strong presence, dipshit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They force people to starve and work without pay not worship. Nobody is condemned for not believing what the government says to believe, well, as far as religion is concerned. Hell, even the Nazi's had a few good ideas about how to govern Germany but just because I can acknowledge that does not mean I support the Nazi party.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You typed it right here. Not a spin, these are your words. I direct you to the part in BOLD<br>

Now this is a good reversal spin to minimize backpeddling.  Had to think about this one for a sec.<br>
<br>
First of all, you didn't reply to my rebuttal about &quot;majority&quot;.<br>
<br>
Instead you reworded &quot;without contestation&quot; into &quot;sheep&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess in a way the two would seem similar - obviously that's what you read.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As for my religion it is none of your business because I would rather not give you more fuel for your bigotry, but I am not Muslim. I do however respect other religions and ways of life, when they are chosen by the individual.

<br>
I never said or even implied &quot;majority of Muslims all sheep&quot; and then the &quot;fuck you for implying it&quot;.<br>

What I originally typed in my resume post was:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ability to take direction without contestation<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This was in reference to the position for which the joke was about.  You, in your fit of rage and stupidity, twisted it all out of fucking shape into &quot;ozzone hates muslims and think they are all sheep&quot;<br>
<br>
Nowhere did I say, or even imply, that I hate Muslims.  You really need to think before you type.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If that got your pee pee all shriveled up, sorry.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Well I'm truly sorry that my attempt at a joke, where Saddam would post an ad desiring someone with Islamic background because he embraces Islam now and be taken totally out of context and morphed into calling the majority of all Muslims sheep was racist.<br>

<br>
How far up your ass did you have to go to get that one? That is like saying that &quot;If you drive an SUV, then you shot JR&quot;. Ask Dickchoak if I am part of the &quot;Anti-war Propaganda machine&quot;. I am sorry if the idea of holding two semi-conflicting thoughts in your head at one time frightens you. It is possible not like the idea of war and not agree with the politics behind executing it and still support the overall premise of it and support the troops. <br>
Example: I might not agree with my wife getting breast implants but the end results don't bother me. Or if I do believe in my wife getting breast implants I can still not like the idea of putting them in via the kneecap rout to the chest.<br>
<br>
Take the blinders off and take a look at both sides. It is not black and white. <br>
<br>
I did go to that site you talked about Facts and figures. It seems like ok numbers. I read somewhere that the numbers are higher. If I am wrong so be it, sorry for the misquote. <br>

Yes, at that point I was tossing facts at you and not throwing mud. The fact I tossed at you that got your sheets all wet seemed to be the fact that Christianity is responsible for more deaths in the name of a god than any other religion.

You even lumped them all together AGAIN as sheep. &quot;They are Arab and they will believe what they are told to believe&quot;.

patmcrotch, I'm going to drop this argument.  Why?  Because I don't want to argue about religion.  It's always a no-win situation.<br>

Most people on here saw it simply as a joke.  I never intended to cut down the Islamic faith, I intended to link based on Saddam's manipulation of it for personal gain.  You don't see it that way and I understand why.<br>

Like I said, take whiteout and cross that line out.

How many times do the Iraqi soldiers have to drag women and children out into the streets and hide behind them to shoot at Coalition soldiers before people stop crying about our need to be there or not be there?<br>
<br>
The soldiers of Iraq are dragging women and children out as human shields against the coallition. They are slaughtering citizens that cheer at what they think is their liberation. They are dressing as American and British soldiers, and going into homes and slaughtering people. All of this has been proven by fact in the recent days (even the press, who is by no means in favor of the military actions has admitted this), and still I read stupid people bitching about foreign policy leaders, and having no right to be there.<br>
<br>
Since when did this world get so damn self centered?! Nobody stood for this when Hitler was doing this to the Jews. Yet, it is ok for Saddam to do that to the unimportant Iraqi people. Who gives a shit about them?! Man, we have some F'ed up leaders to want to go in there and take this guy out. He should be left to his own schemes. He should be allowed to slaughter his own women and children as he wishes. Shit, they are only Iraqis right?! Hell, we Canadians, Americans, French, German, and whatever else have bigger things to be concerned with. Like dolphins being caught in nets, and taxes and such!<br>
<br>
Heartless bastards. Makes me ashamed to be a part of the human race at times. Who gives a RATS ASS about who started what. The bastages are slaughtering their own people in order to be victorious. And all we can do is bitch about ourselves and about how important our opinions are. <br>
<br>
Everyone stop and look at your own loved ones, and imagine you lived over there under that regime. And imagine the whole world crying about how unimportant your freedom is. How nobody should be going in and liberating you. How nothing is WRONG! Yet that night, your wife/sister/daughter/mother is dragged out into the street. Tied to a cross post, in the forward leaning position. And has her tongue cut off in public, left there leaning forward to bleed to death. This happened because she said &quot;she hopes the American, and British forces free them soon. And that Saddam does not care about their safety.&quot;<br>
That is not a fictional story. I have seen the pictures of this. It is very mind numbing and terrifying. Al Jezeera celebrated this like it was a great event. She was left in town square for 2 days as a warning to those that speek against Saddam.<br>
<br>
So next time you want to post about &quot;Foriegn Policy Leaders&quot;, or &quot;They have no right to be there&quot;, you think about what those people live under. Do they not trust the American/British forces? Nope, they dont. Because 12 years ago, we promised them freedom, and they rose up. And then we left them without that freedom, and they suffered for it. Now we have to prove to them that we are there for their freedom, and that we WILL win.<br>
<br>
Opinions matter, but for the sake of all that is decent, think about those that are TRULY suffering. Not about your own whims and wants. Hell, I wish we were not there. I think we should be dealing with domestic problems at home in America, not being the world police. Not sending units all over every time someone screams help. But then I stop and think about those people that need the help. Who else is going to do it? Who else will jump up and offer their lives for someone they dont know? Right now, only the Coallition party will. <br>
<br>
Want to talk about money? Talk about being in it for oil or whatever? Hell, the coallition party will be lucky to not go bankrupt when this thing is over. Even if they siezed all the current oil in Iraq, it would barely cover costs of the war, not alone rebuilding. Again, I dont see anyone else jumping in to help rebuild for the Iraqi people when it is done.<br>

P.S. Yes, most religions have been extremely violent in history. But none have been so barbaric as Radical Islam. (No, not Islam, RADICAL Islam). They believe that slaughtering a newborn, or unborn, child is ok. It is demanded even, if it is none Islamic. Anyone happen to know what the Radical Islamics did in Chechnia? (Sp?) Well, one of them were found with the heads of 5 babies tied to his belt. All of them were less than a month or so old. He called them &quot;His proof of cleansing&quot;.<br>
True Islam is a peaceful religion, Radical Islam is a terror group.<br>

<br>
We are at war.  Not just America, but Britain and Australia, too. Other countries support us, others do not.  There is no turning back now, there is nothing further debate and name calling can do to take back the action.  Get your panties in a twist if it'll make you feel better, but keep things in perspective, please.<br>
<br>
We cannot let anti-war sentiments (no matter how valid they may be) interfere with our support of the troops who are over there putting their lives on the line.  We should make damn sure that our political views do not escalate to the point where we stop hating the war and start hating the men and women fighting it. Our defence force personnel had 4/5 of fuck all to do with the decision of whether to or not to go to war. Remember that!<br>
<br>
I guarantee you that a percentage of those overseas fighting right now do not want to be there. They may not even agree with the fact that we're there at all.  But what they ARE doing is their very best under the most trying and terrifying of circumstances. Try motivating yourself to go to work when you hate your job... now think about motivating yourself to go to work when you hate the job you've been asked to do and your country is telling you the job sucks and in the middle of all that, doing the job could get you killed.  Not fun, I would think.<br>
<br>
The war is one thing but let's not mix up politics and religion and fanaticism with the young men and women who are being shot at RIGHT NOW!  On both sides of the fight.<br>
<br>
Hate the war if you want, disagree with being there if you want, that's your right, but let's not turn this into another Vietnam where our soldiers are spat on and ridiculed for fighting in our name.<br>
<br>
That will be the real test.  Can we disagree with something and respect and support the ones on the front line simultanously?  I'd like to think we can.<br>

Every jackass, moron, idiot, savant, nosepicker, mouth-breather, mensa member, PhD, etc. is absolutely convenced that they are looking at the &quot;big picture&quot;.  Every single person professes that they see the &quot;big picture&quot; and are convinced that they are right in their views and anyone who thinks differently is not seeing the &quot;big picture&quot;.<br>
<br>
The problem is that unless you are privy to much more information that what is spewed from any civilian news organization, such as information given to you by God or some incredible mental powers where you can read all minds, or actually do possess omnipotence, you DO NOT see the &quot;big picture&quot;, no matter how much you profess that by some gift of god that you and only your Elite Brethren of God Given Sight Over All (also known as EBOGGSOA) actually see the &quot;big picture&quot;.  You have an OPINION based on what little knowledge that you truly do possess, backed by an enormous amount of journalism and nationality spin, and quite a bit of prejudiced beliefs based on your upbringing and experience.<br>
<br>
So... unless you truly are a member of EBOGGSOA, stop being a complete moronic ass and claiming that you see the &quot;big picture&quot; when others do not, I don't care what side of the fence you are on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grommofbots>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 296<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/27/03 12:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=118>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Promise to the Anti-War Advocates</span><hr size=1> Another thing that really drops my opinion of real intelligence of humans:<br>

How big of a freakin idiot do you have to be to think:<br>
<br>
- You can have a war without military getting killed.<br>
- You can have a war without civilians getting killed.<br>
- You can have a war that lasts only a week (only the Israeli have come close)<br>
- You can have a war without blowing shit up<br>
<br>
I was complaining about the news agencies making huge deals over military folks getting killed... 1!, 2! Two people died today!  Sure, it is not a nice thing to have people die in a war and I hate to see that happen just as much as the next guy.  However, look at wars in the 20th century:<br>
<br>
Casualty rates (how many deaths per number of troops)<br>
WWI = 1 in 15<br>
WWII = 1 in 15<br>
(These two I can't exactly remember, one was 1 in 15, the other was 1 in 13, so I'll put them like this)<br>
Korean = 1 in 15<br>
Vietnam = 1 in 13<br>
Gulf War, 1991 = 1 in 1500<br>
<br>
Interesting that history shows that modern warfare kills about 1 in 15 troops except for the most recent using technology only dreamed of previously.  Considering the number of US troops alone in Iraq, if you use historical values (not including 1991), that comes out to be something like 17,000 expected deaths in this war.  So far, we've had 20. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dytren>Dytren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/27/03 12:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=119>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Promise to the Anti-War Advocates</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>no matter how much you profess that by some gift of god that you and only your Elite Brethren of God Given Sight Over All (also known as EBOGGSOA)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
