class=title>   Re: Reflections....</span><hr size=1> Also posting a day late.<br>
<br>
What I remember of 9-11.  <br>
<br>
For some reason, I curved away from the morning ritual of watching the news, to get the traffic, see if its going to rain see what the polution level warning would be for the day, I was busy helping get the kids ready for school.  Oddly enough they like catching the news for at least the weather reports and traffic reports (all though they ride bikes to school) in the morning.   For some reason, I turned the TV off before it all happened.<br>
<br>
About the time the first plane hit 7:45am (CST).  Was saying good bye to the youngest going to elementry school.  <br>
At 8:05 - was seeing to the Eldest, getting her off to Jr. High or Middle school.<br>
Just a few min later I left the house to catch the bus to work.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough most everyone on the bus didn't not know of the situation either.  The bus ride is 28 min from the stop I get on, to downtown Dallas.  About 5 min after the bus left the station a woman behind me got a phone call and said something about a helocopter hitting the  Pentigon, and them maybe a plane.  Ten min later, my sister called me and said &quot;OMG did you hear?!  Planes have hit the World Trade Centers and the Pentigon, and they got a couple of planes missing!!&quot;    I'm on my way to downtown, not much I can do.  Word spead through out the bus, someone broke out a pocket radio and turned it on... the rule of no loud radios on buses was ignored for the day....<br>
<br>
I got down town, get off the bus at my usual stop and start my 4 block walk to work.. the bells at Rememberance Square are chiming... the first time in 2 years I had heard them Chiming.  I get to work.  I work right next to the Adam's Mark (where Dallas Fan Faire was)... Just across the street, 30 story building.   <br>
<br>
I sat and watched one of the many TVs that were setup.  I watched the 2nd tower collaps.. I missed the first one.  I spent the day, everyone but the call center was sent home (some damn suite made the choice that the 10 people of tech support should stay there on the 30th floor and work.   For those that don't know, Dallas Love Field is just a couple of north of my building.  So frequently in the days previous and even today see the jumbo jets pass the Dallas Skyline.    Every building in downtown closed that day, for the first time that I remember.<br>
<br>
From what I understand from some of the co-workers who went home early, I am kinda happy that I didn't leave early, there were near riots at several of the train stations and bus stations.<br>
<br>
Getting home that night, the children... probably too young to understand the importance, wanted to watch cartoons.  I borrowed one of their small TVs and set it on the kitchen table and watched the news and the Presidents Speech.  <br>
<br>
In the days that followed the co-workers chiming up on how we deserved it, after a day or two of several people bickering at the 2 doing this, I make a very long post, rather uncharacteristic of me and the tread shut down.    It was one of those, I have family that are firefighters, I was a fire fighter (want to go back), and I have been in the towers a few times, though the last time was in 96.  I basicly told them &quot;How the hell dare you to say we deserved this!&quot;   The tread stoped at that, why, I guess because I said what most others felt, and the 2 opposed people didn't want to go on any more.<br>

<br>
Wake up 9ish am EST to my phone rining (which is unusual because my first class was 11:20 so I never woke till past 10. I answered the phone, my mother (an American, where I am Canadian) said 'turn on the tv' before saying hello. I asked what station, she told me 'any channel with news'. First thought... Cnn. <br>
<br>
I turned on Cnn. There was the first tower smoking, I don't recall if the second plane had hit yet or not. I asked my mom, (who I assumed had been watching for hours at least from her office) &quot;What happened?&quot; Her: &quot;Terrorists crashed a plane into the building&quot; Me: &quot;Who did this?&quot; Her: &quot;Who do you think, the Arabs&quot; <br>
<br>
We chatter for a bit, she was crying, she is a very patriotic American. To be honest though, for me, the ONLY thing that seperated this day from any other, was that NY is only a few hours drive from where I live.  <br>
<br>
Terror, is nothing new to me, or my family. It wasn't on sept. 11th either. Sure, I was shocked, I remember the entire day too, wondering if Canada's great CN Tower would fall that day as well, worrying about family/friends around North America, particularly in the U.S.  <br>
<br>
Well, like someone above said, I hoped it would wake the slumbering giant from it's unshakable complacency. It did, praise the lord... but only for a short while. I am also upset with the complacency the world as it is now. <br>
<br>
So yes, Sept. 11th was a big, and memorable day for me. Yes it is forever etched in my memory, and I do definetely sympathize with all those who lost family. However for me, terror is, and has been real for a long time. It is, and will continue to be a clear and present danger. What I am saying is that sept. 11th was not the first, last, or only act of terror, and I would like to see the world memorialize the other victims of terror, world-wide. Oklahoma city, Philipenes, Israel, France, Germany, all over the Muslim world etc..  I wish people would recognize that the U.S. is not the only victim, and realize that even if the threat of Al-Qaeda has been reduced,  no one is safe until all terror has been destroyed.<br>
<br>
Well that is my piece, hope I didn't come off as harsh, but that was how I remembered the day. I remember it as a wake up call to the world, and not new news to me. <br>
<br>
Peace. <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif"</img> <br>
