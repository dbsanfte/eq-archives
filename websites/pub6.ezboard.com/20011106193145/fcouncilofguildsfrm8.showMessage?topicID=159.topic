I was a little scared I was going to have to call it off when we only had 15 people at the beginning of role-call... but folks kept trickling in, and we ended up with a full raid of 48 combatants!<br>
<br>
We had a lot more deaths this time than last time, but we also went in with fewer people, and with less warning.  Hopefully we'll give Vox a good thumping with minimal casualties just to show those Dragons what we can really do when we're not caught off-guard by a raid! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
While there weren't really many caster drops on tonights raid (just the Polished Mithril Mask off of Magus Rokyl), Nagafen is really the melee class' dragon.  We should get some nice caster and priest drops off Vox later this weekend. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'll post a better recap tomorrow I think... I'm real sleepy, and still a little delirious from my CoF roll...<br>
<br>
Thanks again for coming everyone, and I expect to see a lot of familiar faces when we face Vox this weekend! <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

I'm sorry I had to leave the raid early.  My ISP seems to have lost one of its T-1 lines and was using a secondary feed which was causing me major lag problems even with all the lag features turned down.  <br>

So I came on to check on Naggy just to see what was up - and he wasn't.  So I log out and go back to reading the other kGC posts and, lo and behold, Naggy had popped litterally within a minute or two of me checking.<br>
<br>
So I came back on to EQ to see what kind of response I'd get the from usual suspects if we went for a trade (seeing as how we could very well be up for Naggy even if we didn't trade if FA posted a pass on KGC).  I was getting some decent feedback - not too many actual raiders were on, but enough guild-mates were spreading the word so it seemed like we'd be ok.  So I informed the FA liason around 7pm EST that FoF/CoG would go ahead and do Naggy tonight, feeling pretty good about our chances.<br>
<br>
Then 8pm rolls around and there's hardly a soul in Lavastorm, and not that many folks online who had signed up for the raid... and Creirwyy and I start roll-call at something like 8:30 and get about oh... 9-12 people in the first couple rounds of shouts.  An icy pit was growing in my stomach at this point... what had I done?  Had I just commited CoG to a raid failure?!<br>
<br>
But people kept slowly trickling in as folks came online and guild-mates and friends were called in to join the raid.  And eventually we ended up with a full 8 groups of raiders, with Fazlazen coming along to make sure we had the level 51(?) Group Resist Magic buff (and to charm the occasional Fire Giant, hehe).  Areanna (sp?) also joined us to provide Reviviscence from her epic - CR and res'ing is always faster with an epic cleric along, ain't it?<br>
<br>
We finally starting zoning in around 10pm EST I think... and while it took us a couple tries to get everyone settled into the Stone Spiders room, we all made it eventually. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    After asking permission Paralax had cleared out the early Fire Giants in order to perform CR for one of their fallen (but very courteously left a full spawn of named FG's up for us).  As we were moving up a couple groups took a tour of Warlord Skarlon's bedroom... but we all assembled outside the buffing room to kill the 4 FG's in the room, and eventually the 3 in the lair (including Magus Rokyl).<br>
<br>
Talovar joined us just before the brave Kefo pulled all 4 of the FG's out of the buffing room.  With Fazlazen, Tkachuk, Daemyan, and Talovar (I think) all charming FG's... well, I don't think we had any causualties in that fight, we just had a tough time finding a non-charmed target to whack at from time to time... But we did well - most groups would have the common courtesy to have at least a FEW deaths against 4 FG's in a single pull... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Kefo and Jutt went into the lair to pull out the remaining giants and Magus Rokyl - once again Kefo managed to FD with less than a bubble of health remaining.  But we took Magus and his cohorts down with ease and soon were prepping for the buffline.<br>
<br>
Talovar set up the &quot;assembly line&quot; with his usual precision and things went pretty well until the end - when Nagafen kicked a few of the 53+ buffers out because they cast spells on folks that were still on Naggy's agro list.  In future I'll try to remember to have everyone camp out before entering the line, just to be safe.  Thanks to Gargos from Paralax, as well as Fazlazen and Areanna from Council of Lost Souls for providing a few high level buffs.<br>
<br>
We met up in the chatroom, went over strategy, and came back ready to rumble.  Naggy went down after a decent fight - he managed to kill quite a few more people than last time... but we were going in with fewer numbers and less warning than before and still got the job done!<br>
<br>
He dropped a Cloak of Flames, 2 Gauntlets of Fiery Might, a Gold Plated Koshigatana, and Selo's Drum of the March.  The res'ing was done very soon after the fight ended (again thanks to Areanna), and we settled down and started lotto'ing off the loot!  After winning the cloak, I followed the example set by Haemish and Rbecka before me and lotto'd off the FBSS I wasn't going to be needing anymore - this seems to be something of a CoG tradition, and I hope it continues.<br>
<br>
So thanks to everyone who came on such short order.  As it turns out we would definitely have been up for Vox and Naggy at the same time if we hadn't gone for the trade with FA last night - Karana came down briefly today so both are up now.  I hope to see a lot of familair faces in Everfrost tonight when we take on &quot;the other Antonican Dragon&quot;!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.
