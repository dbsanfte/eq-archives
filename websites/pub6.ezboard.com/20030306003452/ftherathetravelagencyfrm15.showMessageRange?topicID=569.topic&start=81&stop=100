yes  i agree.   thus when you see you cant kill a mob that takes a group and another group enters to do the turn in and kill it, YOU DONT KILL THE TURN IN MOB.   <br>
<br>
Im sure if this individual had a group coming to him and spoke with Jag and Rog Im sure they would have backed of for a bit.   But I doubt thats the case   why the hell would you kill the turn in mob you claim to need and laugh about it?      <br>

Play Nice Policy states that:<br>
*edit*<br>
You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.<br>
Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of players. This includes things such as:<br>
<br>
Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area. <br>
*edit*<br>
Wrong, there are rules against being an ass. Here's one of them. <br>
<br>
Outside of the Play Nice rules, there are server conventions, one of which is that if you are ready to go on a quest, and another group is enroute but not there, it's *your* mob, regardless of if they have a level X toon there waiting/camping. <br>
<br>
You are wrong. There was no 'playing the heavy'. There was 'playing by server conventions' and if you don't like them, that's one thing. But don't pretend that abiding by them makes you the bad guy.<br>
<br>
And if ever I was engaged in a race mob, and I lost the race, I wouldn't flame whoever won it. What would be the point of being upset about people playing *by* the rules?<br>
<br>
Sure, I can be annoyed that I lost, but that has nothing to do with the rules of the server. <br>
<br>
If group A wasn't fast enough to beat group B, that has nothing to do with the conventions the server operates under. It has everything to do with the ability of group B to move faster. <br>
<br>
Would anyone support a system by which Group A gets an extra half hour if they didn't have a wizard or druid with them? Should we make group B wait because they got there faster? <br>
<br>
I really hope you can see that distinction, if none other.<br>

<br>
You keep going on and on about server convention and how it was followed. My point is that just following the server conventions is nothing to be proud of. It may in fact be something to ashamed of, depending on circumstance.<br>
<br>
Do you remember when there were no limits on the number of &quot;friends&quot; from any particular guild joining another guild on its reserved day in a plane? There were people who took advantage of the situation to get multiple bookings of the planes. There was nothing wrong with that according to the server convention of the time, yet it was still wrong. Or are you going to argue that? There is a reason the rules have since changed.  <br>
<br>
It is possible to follow server convention and still do something wrong. Your argument seems to be that as long as someone follows server convention, they haven't done anything wrong. <br>
<br>
My point, in language as concise and clear as possible: Following server convention is the absolute minimum expected from anyone. Doing so is nothing to be proud of. There may be situations where doing so is actually something to be ashamed of. I think this is one of those. As I mentioned earlier, it is the MINIMUM expected of us.<br>
<br>
I agree with you completely that Chop should not have killed the mob.  <br>
<br>
What does the server convention regarding &quot;race&quot; mobs mean? Quite explicitly, it means &quot;might makes right&quot;. If you have the force, it is yours. While this may work well at the guild/multi group level for high end, contested mobs, it isn't something that works well for single group mobs. It just doesn't. Here is an example why.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> [Rules are not the only thing there is to social interaction. There are also little things like respect, empathy, kindness.]<br>

This is so disingenuous I find it sickening. Rog at least has a position that is based on an intellectually honest argument (which I happen to disagree with). This, however, is just pathetic. <br>
<br>
Let's look at it from the point of view of both of these people, as much as we possibly can (that is what empathy means, since you don't seem to understand the word). Chop put a considerable amount of time into camping the angry goblin. Jagganath gathered a group and travelled to the zone &lt;--- that was the extent of his investment of time in this particular spawn. <br>
<br>
Let's at least be intellectually honest, shall we?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What are you trying to say Graal? That Jag should have waited 2, 3, 4, hell 24 hrs before he had the sk spawn?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It would have been decent of him to come to the conclusion that Chop had put alot of time into the camp, and why not just let him have this one, maybe even offer to help him with the kill. At worse, just wish Chop luck and come back next time. If he had done either of those things, no one would have any reason to question whether he did the right thing, would they?<br>
<br>
Or maybe he could camp it himself. <br>

I do not agree with what he did to resolve it however.  I left Drinal Server around 4 months ago because of speaking with coworkers that play on the Rathe and learning of the gentleman's rules.  I must say we are very blessed on the Rathe to have such a civilized society that come together for the greater good.  On Drinal there are NO rotations, EVERY mob is a race, and I had seen more than enough of my entire guild buffing in front of a mob only to have an &quot;Uber&quot; guild run over the top of us and slaughter our challenge in 3 seconds.  What made me sick was the lack of honor in this.  It's the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer scenairio.  What can one do when this happens?  Pretty much nothing, try telling a guild of 200 level 60 primal equipped members (Cats N Hats) that moved over when Drinal was new in a split and dominated from the beginning that they are wrong to walk over lower guilds, or even guildless people.<br>
<br>
Too me it sometimes becomes the case of I am bigger than you so move outta my way, it takes you longer to get help because you are unguilded, that's not my problem either...sure you were here first, but so what you are weak I am strong *push 6th grader to the ground as a 12th grader and run in for the touchdown...sometimes it's feels better to let the 6th grader try and fail then to take the ball from him.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents.  I think Chops was a d!ck for killing the mob, but I totally see where he is coming from having moved servers entirely because of my disgust with bullying behavior such as this.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion flame me if you wish..it's easy to do when you are on the green side of the fence. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugraalthedorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Graal the Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tad-pole</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/5/02 2:52:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Chops</span><hr size=1> You are right Milambus, I am making an assumption.

2) In another thread, I have read that certain guild members disregarded the &quot;will of the Rathe*&quot; and entered one of the planes without being signed up, and had apparently done it several times in the past.  No one raised a fuss at this revelation.<br>
<br>
3) In this thread, Chopstickz has been chastened and degraded for 3 pages for not following the &quot;will of the Rathe*&quot; in regard to killing the AG (a quest hand-in mob).<br>
<br>
How are these 3 situations different?  Chopstickz apparently had his(her) reasons** for disregarding the &quot;will of the Rathe*&quot; just as the 2 guild leaders stated they would in 1st situation, and the guilded players indicated they did in the 2nd situation.  In all 3 situations, the person(s) acting contrary to the &quot;will of the Rathe*&quot; had/have their reasons for doing so, in spite of existing (or proposed, in case 2) agreements, rules, conventions.  In all 3 situations, the players following the &quot;will of the Rathe&quot; were (or would be, in case 2) inconvenienced, with time lost.<br>

<br>
So, it's wrong to play by the rules? <br>
<br>
It's bullying if you get there faster, but someone else wants it, is that right? <br>
<br>
I want the frenzy camp for my group, but there's another group there already, who are capable of holding the area. What ever shall we do? On the server *I* think we play on, you leave and try again another time. <br>
<br>
But wait... what if that group that is capable of holding the area isn't a group any more, and not capable of holding the spawn? What if that 'group' is instead a level 50 monk? Should the group that is ready to go *not* take frenzy because someone else wants it? <br>
<br>
If that's the case, from now on, frenzy is mine and mine alone, based only on the simple truth that... I want it. Since it is obviously bullying to take something from me that I want, especially if I was there first regardless of my ability to actually do anything with it, you'll have to recognize that I have at least, oh, an hour to gather up the groupmates that I want so I can move in.<br>
<br>
Look, the bottom line is that if you are going to say this...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
you also have to realize that sometimes people are going to 'lose' the race. Chopstickz lost, and no matter if Jagg was in United Necro's, or BotS or unguilded, he and his friends got there first. <br>
<br>
And if you are going to say this...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I agree with you completely that Chop should not have killed the mob. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

it is not consistant to then say that this statement...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
is wrong. If you believe that the quest mob should have been left alone, then you believe that it should not have been killed. Since, left up, Jagganath would have been able to do the quest, you either have to say that chopstickz was right in preventing everyone from doing the quest, or that Jagganath should have been able to proceed, because by the conventions, Jagg won. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Your argument seems to be that as long as someone follows server convention, they haven't done anything wrong. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Actually, my argument doesn't <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>seem</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> to be that at all. That is my argument *exactly*. You cannot say that someone is doing something wrong by *not* breaking a server convention, because they aren't doing anything that runs contrary to the general position of the server. <br>
<br>
Look, it's quite simple. What is the server convention? The group with the sufficent force there first, gets to try the mob. <br>
<br>
Does that convention not apply when there is someone else involved? Is the convention therefore &quot;If you are there first, and with a sufficent force, and no one else is there, you can try the mob&quot;? No, it's not. <br>
<br>
You can't punish people for obeying the rules. You can't say that sometimes it is wrong to follow the conventions. Here's why:<br>
<br>
If it were wrong to follow conventions at times, in the way they are designed, than they could be broken by anyone, at any time. If conventions do not work for anyone, then they will stop working for everyone. <br>
<br>
If, for example, Chopstickz had shown up second, but with a kill force, it would have been his kill. Targetting the 'ubers' and saying &quot;oh, well, they should have waited another half hour/hour/two hours for Chopstickz to gather forces&quot; what incentive are we offering them to follow the conventions? <br>
<br>
None, that's what. <br>
<br>
In the real world, this quote is designed to illustrate the blind neutrality of the legal system.<br>
<br>
&quot;The law, in its magestic equality, forbids both the rich and the poor to beg in the streets, live under bridges, or steal bread&quot;<br>
<br>
Naturally, this is meant to show that while the law forbids it for everyone, only one group of people ultimately experiance the application of this law. <br>
<br>
Lets look at what we've established in this situation, however. <br>
<br>
First, we've established that Chopstickz had friends coming, and not far off. <br>
<br>
Second, we've established that shortly after this incident, he was guilded with one of the top three guilds on the server, which to me suggests that he at least knew a few people in a large guild. Logic to that statement: What guild would tag up someone being flamed if he was, on all other accounts, totally unknown to the members? I suggest that not only would chopstickz have had to be known, but would have to be liked by the members of the guild that tagged him. Had this incident happened a week later, this would be an uber vs. uber situation, and the 'unguilded' card could not be played. And unless you want to suggest that the most successful guilds on the server have a completely open recruitment policy, with no prior interaction with potential members, you have to admit that in all liklihood, Chopstickz could have rallied sufficent forces in a reasonable time. <br>
<br>
So you can look at this from one of two directions: The poor unguilded monk that still had a sufficent force en route to the zone only ten minutes slower than one of the major uber guilds on the server, or the monk with people on the way who got all bent out of shape because he lost a race to a mob by ten minutes and killed the quest mob instead. <br>
<br>
The 'poorer getting poorer' situation does not apply here, and I would ask you to logically reason out that it applies *less* to single group encounters than it does to large scale raid encounters.<br>
<br>
I am going to again, be blunt. If you, in 55+ levels, have not made, say, 10 friends online, even though you've been guildless for the entire time, you have not been playing a multiplayer game, and can't really be justified in claiming that you have no friends so you need leeway, when it comes back to bite you in the ass. <br>
<br>
I would suppose that the difficulty a member of a fairly large guild finds in getting 6 people together, is not substantially more difficult than getting 6 people together who are not members of a fairly large guild, or even a guild at all. <br>
<br>
Hell, I remember one day we snagged a level 60 noble blade warrior for a general raid, out of the blue. As long as you have a single teleporting class, you really don't have a huge time dispairity between large guilds and unguilded. <br>
<br>
Do you really believe that an *entire* uber guild is going to mobalize on a single Angry Goblin spawn? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
My point is that just following the server conventions is nothing to be proud of. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
First off all, that's an attitude born of playing on the server for a time. No, no one expects praise for *not* stealing, in real life, obviously, because it's expected that you will not steal. However, where in the game, there is *nothing* to force you to maintain server conventions other than the knowledge that it is better if you do so, for everyone, then following server conventions becomes worthwhile, even if it is not in your self interest at that moment<br>
<br>
I will refine the argument that you put forward: Sometimes, it is *nice* of people to break with conventions and say &quot;well, technically it is our mob, but you can have it, good luck&quot;. But no one is obligated to do that, nor should they be, as you are suggesting, Graal. If the system is broken, it would be very obvious, as you illustrate with your example of the unlimited guests to the planes scenario you present. A very broken system would be something which *forced* an obligation above and beyond server conventions on certain people, or certain groups of people. <br>
<br>
However, as Livius pointed out to me, making misleading comparisons does not prove your argument, in fact, it weakens it. <br>
<br>
You have cited a problem situation, one which was rectified. Are you claiming that the current rules to a race mob are wrong? What then, would your alternative be? Instead of 'first group to the mob with force' would you say 'first group to the mob with force, unless the guild has more than 40 level 60's in it, in which case, they have a minimum waiting time of 2 hours, to allow others to show up'?<br>
<br>
If you are going to claim that conventions are subjective, then why have them at all? If they do not apply as equally to an unguilded player as they do a guilded one, obviously one of those two groups is going to remove themselves from the arrangement, and I wouldn't blame them. <br>
<br>
So what's the end result?<br>
<br>
Do you still think that the winners of a race should *always* wait for anyone else to show, and then what? random on who gets the mob? No, naturally not, because that removes the purpose of a race mob, right?<br>
<br>
You obviously don't think that the winners should *never* wait for anyone else to show, you encourage people to wait or give the spawn up, in fact. That's certainly admirable, but really, that's kindness above and beyond what the community describes for the situation. Example: My partner at work, her apartment burned two nights ago. I am not obligated to offer to pay her bills with my check while she tries to buy new clothes and food with hers. It would, however, be nice of me, but I'm not under *any* obligation to do so. Would you say I was 'in the wrong' if she asked me for 800 bucks and I said &quot;no&quot;? <br>
<br>
Jagganath had no obligation to a player he didn't know, other than prescribed by the server rules, because *those* are the rules that we abide by. <br>
<br>
You can't say he was doing something wrong by wanting something for himself, and you can't say that he *has* to put himself second or lower in line, just because someone else wants it. If that was the case, why don't you say that Chopstickz was wrong in wanting something for himself, and *he* has to put himself second or lower in line, just because someone else wants it.<br>
<br>
I suspect that if big bad BotS had been beaten by little ol Chopstickz, and *they* had killed the turn in mob, that your attitude would be totally differant. I suspect that you would be laying a heavy blame then. <br>
<br>
And so would I.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There was nothing wrong with that according to the server convention of the time, yet it was still wrong.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Because you brought it up: Wrong how?<br>
Because it was exploiting the intent of the system? Because it wasn't intended to let people book multiple days in a row? I'd say you'd have to be pretty convincing to deny that it was changed because it made things *un*fair. <br>
<br>
So ask yourself: what's the intent of the system?<br>
<br>
To allow a group/raid to have an uninterupted chance at a mob, no matter who the group is, or is made up of, as long as they were there first and could have a *chance* to win. (Claim that the chance is irrelevent, and I swear I will try to claim Trakanon with 10 level one players)That sounds a whole lot differant than the example you are citing, because it is, in fact, completely differant. Take a page from Livius's book, and use examples that mean something, other than trying to insinuate that there is something very wrong when in fact, it's working nicely until someone doesn't follow the guidelines<br>

If you'd read the older ragefire threads, you would find many more than just two guilds saying they would not support a rotation or list. The recent announcement on my part, and VoF's part is old news. It is done to illustrate why a list/rotation would not work, because *most* guilds have said that they officially consider a list/rotation to be a horrible idea. If all the people involved considered a list to be a wonderful solution...there would be a list. If all the people involved thought a rotation was the best way to go, there would be a rotation. If a guild acted *against* the way that most guilds on the rathe were going, then you would see some ruckus. Watch if someone posted a list, complete with names and a detailed explanation of how the rotation would work. People would be coming out of the woodwork to say they don't support it. <br>

If you are refering to Yama Clan's foray's to sky for the monk epic on several non-booked days, it is because sky is primairily not booked, and any plane that is not booked is &quot;First Come, First Served.&quot; If you are refering to the (as yet) unsubstantiated claims of several spots in fear being cleared late, and a golem dying after ownership of the plane was transfered, then those would be in violation of the RTA policies, and I would suspect that guilds involved would be quite verbal about the situation. In fact, if you would read the thread about Yama Clan heading to sky on a day that Frayed Knot was scheduled, you will see that the raid leader apologized on several occasions in tells and at least once on these boards. Perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that you don't *have* to sign up, to go up on a day where no one is signed up. But you do have to make sure you don't go up on a day that was already booked, which was the confusion in this case.<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I disagree. First, in this thread, we are now moving beyond the &quot;Chopstickz is a lamer&quot; ideas or defenses of that idea, and rather are dealing more now with explaining the understanding of how mobs, race mobs, quest mobs or other contested things actually work. Secondly, he didn't follow the rules. Where is the confusion?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
How are these 3 situations different? Chopstickz apparently had his(her) reasons** for disregarding the &quot;will of the Rathe*&quot; just as the 2 guild leaders stated they would in 1st situation, and the guilded players indicated they did in the 2nd situation. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
In your first example, I believe I have been clear that it is not 2 rogue guilds saying they will not respect a rotation, but rather that it is 2 guilds again reaffirming what many guilds have posted previously: Ragefire lists or rotations will fail because a large number of guilds on the server do not recognize them, therefore they are actually *not* acting contrary to the rules of the Rathe. If a rotation or list was in place, and working to the benefit of all, I am sure that a departure would cause much headache. <br>
<br>
Imagine then if BotS said they were now ignoring all rotation dates, and instead would take what they wanted, when they wanted, on all of the rotations. In that case, they would be acting contrary to the will of the rathe. Maintaining the status quo is obviously not the same as breaking the conventions of the rathe, the two are contradictory positions. <br>
<br>
In your second situation, I believe I have explained the confusion in the matter, and if you'd like, I can link to the threads which say that it has been dealt with between the involved guilds. I have to make the claim that if the two guilds involved have not been put out too badly, and that there are no flames popping up from the involved parties, (minus obligatory wit from Jurrasic), that the matter was resolved to both groups satisfaction: Yama members have said they would check the calendar more dilligently, have apologized, and have assured members of the community that it would not happen again. Imagine my surprise if Chopstickz posted an apology: I am sure that we would continue to discuss the nature of a race mob, or the nature of fairplay long after Jagganath had accepted or rejected that apology.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
In all 3 situations, the person(s) acting contrary to the &quot;will of the Rathe*&quot; had/have their reasons for doing so, in spite of existing (or proposed, in case 2) agreements, rules, conventions. In all 3 situations, the players following the &quot;will of the Rathe&quot; were (or would be, in case 2) inconvenienced, with time lost.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
In your first example, actually, I can say that players following the will of the rathe were not affected in any way, shape or form: the policies regarding the ragefire camp were being discussed, but no changes were made, no agreements struck upon. Because of that, the status quo is maintained, and nothing has changed. Since nothing changed, nothing can be said to have been lost, or inconvenienced, save perhaps for the time it takes to write these messages.<br>
<br>
In the second example, players were inconvienenced, and the matter was resolved, as I understand it, on both these boards and in game, to the satisfaction of all involved.<br>
<br>
In your final example, however, of Chopstickz having his own reasons as an extension of people not following the conventions of the server is flawed: There was no accidental mistake made or hypothetical situation reached. No discussion of racemobs culminated with a new rotation on every available mob, and the monk in question did not clear the entire dungeon not knowing it was already booked. <br>
<br>
Even those who detract from my position with great precision admit that Chopstickz was wrong to kill the turn in mob. I would suggest that my greatest support lies with the fact that people are saying that it would have been better for jagg to let him go first, but he still shouldn't have killed the quest mob. <br>
<br>
That is the distinction, and why there is a differance between a warning about the badness of a list, the accidental entry into a booked plane, and the intentional killing of a quest mob. <br>

Both parties stated that thye worked out thier difficulties, so why should the rest of the server jump on the flame wagon?<br>
<br>
Yamabushi Clan doesn't even have posting access to the calendar so we can't even suspend or revoke that if such actions warrented it.  An RTA Administrator did post that what they did was wrong, but since the problem was worked out between the parties involved there was nothing else that needed to be done.<br>

<br>
1)  The link you provided was the correct one.  The guilds in question stated that *IF* the RageFire were changed to a list or rotation (This means that a majority of guilds on the Rathe voted to make this so) that they INTENDED to disregard the Rule, and that RageFire would become FFA (a race mob).<br>
<br>
In effect, they told us that if they don't agree with a particular rule, they will ignore it (and some of their members apparently did ignore rules they didn't agree with below).<br>
<br>
2)  The link you provided was the correct one.  I did not name the thread for it named a guild in the title.  Here, the players admitted they had entered the plane against RTA rules (and would NOW check the schedule before entering).  They did inconvenience and delay the scheduled guild, and yes, they did work out a compensation for the infraction and delay.<br>
<br>
It seemed obvious that they KNEW they were not supposed to be there, and that they said they had done this before.  I am not pointing this out so that their priveledges could be revoked, or they be punished.  I point it out because what they did seems no more or less serious than what Chopstickz did.  It seems they knew better, but chose to disregard the rules.<br>
<br>

Actually, my argument doesn't seem to be that at all. That is my argument *exactly*. You cannot say that someone is doing something wrong by *not* breaking a server convention, because they aren't doing anything that runs contrary to the general position of the server. [/quote]<br>
<br>
Either you are purposefully not seeing my point, are unable to see my point, or your standards of human behavior are much lower than mine are. I'm guessing it's option number 1.<br>
<br>
You obviously missed everything I said &quot;minimum acceptable behavior&quot;. Let me spell it out for you:<br>
<br>
It is not against any rule for a boss to be verbally abusive to his employees, yet it is still morally wrong.<br>
<br>
It is not against any rule for someone to walk past a homeless person and tell them to &quot;get a @#%$ job, bum!&quot; yet it is still morally wrong.<br>
<br>
It is not against any rule for a parent to be emotionally abusive to their children, yet it is morally wrong. <br>
<br>
It is not against any rule for a teacher to be emotionally abusive to the children in his/her class, yet it is still morally wrong.<br>
<br>
It is not against any rule for a person to use trickery to sell a product that doesn't live up to the expectations he/she created in the customer, yet it is still morally wrong.<br>
<br>
Here is a nice example...it is not against any rule for a wealthy person to travel to a nation in the middle of a famine and use their wealth to buy up all available food, then have it burned. Would you consider that morally wrong?<br>
<br>
Is the point obvious enough now? If all you aspire to is the minimum acceptable standards of behavior, don't expect people to applaud you for it.<br>

The very fact that 2 guilds would not agree to such a rotation/list would mean that it is not a community standard.  They also knew from previous discussions that such an agreement would not be made.<br>
<br>
So, basically they were just stating forcefully that they would not agree to such a rotation/list.<br>
<br>
I can see how if you have never interacted with these people before or had not read the previous discussions that you could draw the wrong conclusions.  <br>
<br>
2)  Once again I believe you are drawing an incorrection conclusion.  It very easy to assume that no one would be in Sky.. because no one ever is in Sky.  They jsut happened to think that on a day that someone was going to go there.  <br>
<br>
They got talked to and now they know to check the calendar even if they think no one will be in Sky that day.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It seemed obvious that they KNEW they were not supposed to be there, and that they said they had done this before. &quot;<br>
<br>
They said they had gone into Sky on days when no one was in there before, which is prefectly ok.  Sky is generally only reserved 2 days a week, Saturday and Sunday.  If a plane is not booked then it becomes FFA and anyone can go in there at will.<br>

They worked it out because both parties have come to a mutually agreeable resolution to the problem.  <br>
<br>
Chop to my knowledge has done nothing to attempt to make amends for killing the quest mob.  As such there has been no mutually agreeable resolution to the situation.<br>

See thats why people get flamed.  Not when they fu'ck up, but when they fu'ck up and don't own up to it.  <br>

Personal bais generally does not help correct any situation and should be left outside the RTA (as much as possible).  <br>
<br>
Also you really look into the facts before making assumptions as well.  Yamabushi Clan is not a large guild.  Neither is Clan Bashemded.  Both of these guilds are smaller guilds that do some raids, but are not nessicarily raid orinated guilds (i.e. uber).<br>
<br>

<br>
1) I know of the RTA what I read on the boards.  I tend to accept that people write what they mean, and mean what they write.  I accept that in this case they may have overstated their case for emphasis.<br>
<br>
2) Even before I knew of the RTA, I knew there was someplace that you had to check before you went to a plane.  &quot;Assuming&quot; that a plane-level guild-members had been told there was a reservation system, even though in my non-planes level guild (at the time) was VERY aware of it, was wrong of me.  Assuming that in all the times these planes-level guild-members (the whole party of them) had been to the planes, no one ever mentioned to them there was a reservation system, was indeed foolish of me.<br>
<br>
3) Chopstickz.  You're right, he has not &quot;owned up&quot; to what he did.  At least not here on the RTA.  Likely, he is not even aware this discussion is taking place.  It would have been interesting to hear his motives for doing this, I'm sure the thread would have taken an entirely different course.<br>
<br>
Milambus said: &quot;Also you really look into the facts before making assumptions as well. Yamabushi Clan is not a large guild. Neither is Clan Bashemded. Both of these guilds are smaller guilds that do some raids, but are not nessicarily raid orinated guilds (i.e. uber).&quot;<br>
<br>
I made no &quot;assumption&quot;, my facts do not need looking into.  From my perspective, (being a &quot;small&quot; guild person, as I stated), they both are a large guilds, or at least I see their names above PC's frequently.  When I do a &quot;/who all ...&quot; the list is too long to be displayed.  I did not use the word &quot;uber&quot; to refer to either guild.<br>

<br>
OOOOOooo, I see now. You think that following the rules when it benefits you is *wrong*, even if you also follow rules when they don't benefit you. Ok, I get it. See, we're crossing wires there. I call that behavior &quot;fair&quot;, being that you abide by the consequences of the rules, and also don't expect more benefit than anyone else would get. See, wrong, to me, implies a negative action or thought process. I bet that's the source of all our confusion. <br>
<br>
Using your own words:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Let me spell it out for you<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
All of your examples imply a *negative action* on the part of the person being morally wrong. Someone is emotionally abusive. Someone is rude. Someone burns food. Someone does something morally reprehensible. You know what's *not* morally reprehensible? Wanting to do something in the game, even if it runs contrary to what someone else wants. <br>
<br>
This is why they are incorrect examples, and serve only to inflame by giving obviously exaggerated real life examples for an in game situation, about which you had this to say.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Do I know the specifics of what happened? No, I don't need to. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
See, since Jagg didn't have the negative action that all your examples have in them, of people being rude to employees or children or burning food, your attacking the minimum acceptable standards is moot. Jagganath zoned in with his group, ready to go, like the rules allow, and after finding out that he was beaten, Chopstickz killed the mob. Your examples are all incorrect, because you assume that Jagg zoned in, and said &quot;I know you've been here for 10 days, but I'm going to take your mob anyway and then I am going to burn some food&quot;. <br>
<br>
So perhaps you'd better rethink the position as not <br>
&quot;aspir{ing} to is the minimum acceptable standards of behavior&quot; but rather *expecting those standards from another player*. Oh, what a horrible idea, eh? To think that another player might *gasp* live up to the same minimum acceptable standards of behavior. Whatever would we do, if the server was filled with conventions based around that very thing...<br>
<br>
If it was NB and BotS in a race for, say, mob X, how would you handle that dispute?<br>
<br>
Lets say that there was 1 NB in the zone for 5 hours, and then BotS got there in force, followed 30 minutes later by a force of NB. How would you call that conflict? Neither party has done anything wrong at this point, morally or otherwise, they both just want to kill the same mob, or do the same quest. <br>
<br>
Would you say that NB gets to do it because they had one person in the zone already? That's pretty easy going of you, if that indeed would be your answer.<br>
<br>
So yeah, let me just make it a little more obvious why the harping on minimum acceptable standards is getting kinda old, and irrelevant:<br>
<br>
When Chopstickz and Jagg both wanted to kill the goblin, neither one had done anything wrong, morally or otherwise, not by server standards, not by Play Nice Policy Standards. <br>
<br>
Jagg had a force present to kill it. By server standards, bringing a force to engage a mob doesn't seem wrong to me. By the play nice policy standards, neither person had turned in the quest note, so therefore, neither one had claim to the resultant spawn. Hmmm, no *wrong* behavior yet.<br>
<br>
Oh, wait, right, here comes the wrong behavior... Chopstickz kills the quest mob! Right, I knew that came somewhere about here in the story. Well, lets see: that violates the server standards of losing by the rules and not being a d!ck about them...oh, and look, it violates the Play Nice Policy and it's quest interferance part too. <br>
<br>
So, Jagg trained him in response, and then burned some food. <br>
<br>
Oh, wait, no he didn't. <br>
<br>
Well, what did he do? He must have blocked the path out of the zone, so chopstickz couldn't leave. That would be a violation of the play nice policy, that must be your negative behavior... but wait... no, Jagg didn't do that either... uh... I hate to tell you this, but Jagg didn't have any negative behavior that you can pin the 'morally wrong' flag on, unless it is your contention that having a desire to finish a quest, and the ability to finish a quest is somehow wrong in the context of everquest, over someone who has the desire but not the ability. I think it would be impossible to make the claim that wanting to do a quest/kill a mob/get an item that someone else also wants is anything approaching 'morally wrong'. <br>
<br>
So no, I don't think anyone is looking for a healthy round of applause for those who were just... you know... playing the game. I think actually, the point, that you may or may not have missed, is that we were pointing out a player who *didn't* live up to your oft mentioned minimum acceptable standards of behavior. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
There may be situations where doing so is actually something to be ashamed of. I think this is one of those<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ashamed of what? Both having a claim, but one being able to do something about it at the time? I'm sorry, but you are way off base if you think that winning the rush to a race mob is something to be ashamed of. It is simply working within the rules provided. It must be nice to have the luxury of saying this from the perspective of someone who's never wanted to do something that someone else was also interested in. You must be the single most easy-going person in the game. <br>
<br>
Here's why we have minimums: to dictate the standard of behavior when two people who don't know each other, meet up and both parties want the same thing. If I was in Droga, and the golbin had popped for me, I know Jagganath would have said &quot;Goe ahed Rogg, joo take dis wun&quot;. But since Jagganath doesn't know Chopstickz from a hole in the ground, he doesn't owe him anything but the courtesy of the standards of the rathe, and you know, aside from a round of applause, that's all he wanted in return. <br>
<br>
Funny about that, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Not to be quite so insincere about the whole thing now, but if you still don't understand the differance, I'm going to have to say...<br>

They did something wrong.  But then they actively tried to work to correct the problem and promised to correct thier behavior in the future.  What else would you want from them?  There was no reason to comtinue flaming them at that point, so people stopped.<br>
<br>
And I believe that was the distinction you were trying to make.  That guilds didn't get flamed, while individuals did.  My point is that this is not a Guild vs Individual issue, but rather a honest fu'ckup vs being a fucktard issue.  <br>
<br>
Now if they do this again in the future, then I'm sure the flames will rise again.  And will not be satisfied with just them saying they won't do it again.<br>
<br>
Also if you really want to see a guild getting flamed, look back a month or so for tha SoT/Ragefire flames.  There are alot of them, and the main thread ended up being 700+ posts.<br>

So no, guilds do not get off easier.<br>

<br>
This thread sure mutated when I wasn't paying attention.<br>
<br>
The FK/Yama situation in NO WAY compares to the Jagganath/Chopstickz situation.<br>
<br>
Milambus nailed it on the head, but I will re-iterate.<br>
<br>
Yama's mistake WAS a mistake, and one that was quickly and not too painfully rectified by them, and I don't think they will be doing the same thing again. If they do, well, as Milambus said, THEN the flames may rise but this situation and it's resolution don't require flaming, everything was handled as well as possible by all involved I think.<br>
