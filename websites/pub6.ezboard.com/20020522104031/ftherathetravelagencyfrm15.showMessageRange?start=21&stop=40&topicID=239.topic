I played my primary toon, male ranger to 48 before I started an alt, which I chose as a female Necro mostly because I didn't like the male Necro models as much.  In the first few weeks of play another female toon hands me 500p and says &quot;good luck starting up!&quot; while i'm killing in EC.  A couple of weeks later a high level Wiz hands me Shadowbound boots, A sacrificial dagger, Dagger of Marnek, Tattered Wrappings - along with some other stuff I dont remember.  In effect twinking the heck outta me, and at the end?  A flower.<br>
<br>
I found this pretty suprising, though.. i figured what the heck.. gear is gear.<br>
<br>
In the homosexual discrimination.. I've seen a lot of people refer to things as &quot;gay&quot; i.e.  Oh.. man.. i got killed by A_Noob_mob_01 that is so gay.<br>
<br>
This I mostly dismiss because it's just plainly childish to do such things, and don't see it as direct hostility toward gay people. <p>"Computer games don't affect kids, I mean if Pac-Man affected us as kids, we'd all be running around in darkened rooms, munching magic pills and listening to repetitive electronic music" -- Kristian Wilsom, Nintendo 1989</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugalactis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galactis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/11/01 12:08:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: RE: Female and gay Hatred in EQ</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
Me not talk much bout dis outta da gild, 'cept for on da www.clanbashemded.com an press button &quot;da birf ub da clan&quot;, but dere am gud reeson dat me am sayin in gild chat dat peeoples shud not use &quot;gay&quot; to indicate a negative occurance in the game. me am gunna drop outta charcter fer dis wun. And I am also going to use language which assumes the readers in this forum are all adult, and able to have a discourse on a subject that uses that language without reducing it to its offensive use. <br>
<br>
In a forum like everquest, where you have people from all walks of life who play, all backgrounds and beliefs, you cannot assume that you know where the other person is coming from, or what offends them. Just because I am a young, overweight, heterosexual caucasion male does not mean that EVERYONE I meet is also a young, overweight, heterosexual caucasion male. <br>
<br>
We are anonomous, except by our characters. The reason that I say, any time it comes up in guild chat &quot;Please refrain from using the word gay to indicate a negative&quot; because simply, people who are homosexual are a member of our community, I have no doubt, if not in Clan Bashemded itself, then definately on the rathe, and I would not be surprised, nor upset to find that one, two, ten, twenty of my guildmates were of alternate sexual orientation from myself. <br>
<br>
In exactly the same vein, I would NEVER say &quot;Oh, I just got killed by A_stupid_mistake, F U C K, what a NIGGER.&quot; I would also not say that it was &quot;GAY&quot;. <br>
<br>
I am not saying that people should guard their language from EVERYTHING that ANYONE could concievably find offensive. But where and when it is very obvious that a term is offensive to a member of the online community, whoever that may be, it is an obligation that falls on all &quot;good&quot; players to remember that NO ONE else's gaming experience should be lessened by your actions. To me, saying something offensive, that could be easily avoided, is just as bad as ruining someone's experience in another way, like training or kill stealing. That's my own belief, take it or leave it. <br>
<br>
Now, I would be naive to say that everyone adheres to this idea. Hell, there are times when I tell jerks to go f u c k themselves. But I don't make a habit of it, and most other players don't either. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, while everyone knows, or at least SHOULD know that &quot;Nigger&quot; is a highly offensive and blatendly bigoted term to use, in game or out, there is a culture of acceptance in North America for discrimination along lines of sexuality.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong. I don't think that everyone in North America hates homosexual people. I do however, believe that most are not concerned with offending people along those lines, just as in the recent past, people were not worried about offending people of colour with derogatory comments. Remember, when spoken in the context of the 1950's and 60's, the term &quot;black&quot; was an acceptable term. In the 1930's, &quot;Blacky&quot; or &quot;Darky&quot; was also common place. Did this offend? Sure, of course it did. Did the people who use it care? No, they didn't. <br>
<br>
Now, in 2001, when someone says &quot;oh, that's gay&quot; I feel that I am living history again. You can replace &quot;gay&quot; in that sentance with &quot;nigger&quot; &quot;kyke&quot; &quot;chink&quot; &quot;jap&quot; &quot;wop&quot; &quot;wog&quot; &quot;nip&quot; or a host of other equally reprehensible language. <br>
<br>
Now, why, you ask, am I going to get responces by people saying &quot;oh, saying &quot;gay&quot; isn't nearly as offensive as saying &quot;nigger&quot; or &quot;chink&quot;?<br>
<br>
Why are people going to be more offended by those terms than by &quot;gay&quot; in this forum? <br>
<br>
Because those words have been, and will continue to be, labelled as the words of oppression and hatred. We know, as a society, or should know, that those words are strongly offensive and that they can, will, and actually do harm to those that read them. <br>
<br>
The reason that people will not agree with my saying that &quot;gay&quot; is every bit as harmful, is because that word has not had the history of oppression that the others have. Not yet. <br>
<br>
And I say &quot;not yet&quot; because I do believe that will change. I believe that enough people will call its offensiveness to the attention of the North American community that it will also someday be as outragous to infer that something is bad by calling it &quot;gay&quot; as it will be to infer that someone is italian by calling them &quot;wop&quot;. <br>
<br>
If you want your language to indicate that something f u c king sucks, say &quot;Holy s h i t, that f u c king sucks&quot;, and not &quot;holy s h i t that's f u c king gay.&quot;<br>
<br>
It just makes sense. <br>
<br>
PS: I find it oddly disturbing that EZ boards censors F U C K, S H I T, and others, but not &quot;nigger&quot; or any of the other offensive words. Personally, I hate that they censor at all. Fuckers. <br>
<br>
PPS: I am bored at work. I would not, nor do I ever, spend this much time replying to a post like this, if I had ANYTHING else to do.<br>

<br>
If I had to make an honest estimation of who even uses the term &quot;gay or ghey&quot; in a derogatory fashion I'd have to say it's the teen or pre-teen crowd.  I think (and this is not a slam) that people in that age bracket are still learning the ropes of social boundaries and still forming their own belief systems/maturing so I just dismiss it as part of the process, no big deal, and don't take offense.  <br>
<br>
I have several gay friends in RL and they do the same.   In much the same way that I put no stock whatsoever in the opinions of people for whom I have no respect, so they could say what they like about me with it not really effecting me personally. <p>52 Ranger of the Rathe <El'lar Dobluth></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unyca.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Singing Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 541<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/17/01 7:23:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=www2.arkansas.net/~thundar/Nycah_the_bard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: RE: Female and gay Hatred in EQ</span><hr size=1> On the Female aspect:<br>

Well, I got roasted and toasted on our message board, as that not being the place for that.  Wtf?

I as a RL female, and most people know that, that I have been around in EQ. I can usually tell when a guy is playing a girl and such just by the way they talk or act. Something manly comes across LOL.<br>
<br>
I have to say though this is the first game that I have played online and have become addicted to it not because of the fun killing and raids, but mostly because of the social aspect and friends that I have come to know. When I have had a bad day or going through a hard time it's always nice to see someone in /gu chat, in zone, or even in group say hi and make me smile.<br>

We should not hate people because of their gender, race, sexual orientation, stance on abortion, religion, age, guild tag, attitude, or anything.<br>
<br>
We should love each other as people, we should care for one another.<br>
<br>
I will admit that I don't think homosexuality is exactly natural, but hey that's my way of thinking, I don't hate someone because they think differently. We are all entitled to our opinions. <br>
<br>
The true crimes come when one person thinks that they have a right to infringe on another persons rights. Then you have a mess.<br>
<br>
A wise man once told me &quot;Yes you have a right to swing your fist, but that right ends where that other guy's nose begins.&quot;<br>
<br>
And I know this is out of character for me, but sadly for many reasons I won't be seeing any of you all for a while, so I want to leave you with these thoughts, and let you know where I stand in RL. <br>
<br>
Take care you all, and why not give a homeless person a dollar today? <p><CENTER><img src="http://www.legendofmarr.com/images/grulsig.jpg"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umortyeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MortyEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 331<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/17/01 1:05:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: RE: Female and gay Hatred in EQ</span><hr size=1> I'd rather buy a homeless person a meal than give them money.

Id say the RTA has been floading with anti muslim/arabic feelings for a months time by now - but i reckon they are not political correct at these times so its ok.<br>
<br>
Anyways get over it.<br>

Yeah, there are people that have anti muslim/arabic sentiments, but you know what? <br>
There are people that have anti-american, anti-semetic, anti-black, anti-white, anti-rich, anti-poor, anti-abortion, anti-life, anti-hate, anti-love. I'd be willing to bet there are people with anti-you sentiments, and that's their call. <br>
Whatever my personal feelings are about the people I meet in my life, I try to remember that above all MY prejudices that they are people, ends-in-themselves, not means to my ends. I might not like someone or something, but I do my best to keep a civil tongue in my head and a thought to their situation before I go off and just spout the first thing that comes to mind. <br>
<br>
Political correctness is not caring about other peoples feelings, but being so worried about your own popularity that you won't say what you are thinking. If you can't see the differance /shrug, not much I can say about that. <br>

That's why I support the Rich People's Anti-Defamation League, or RPAL for short.  Because nothing makes me more sad than people saying &quot;Rich people suck.&quot;  Because, really.. rich people have a tough road to hoe.. granted they pay someone else to hoe it for them.. but it's still tough.  <br>

An Arabian child, Spanish Child, and a coloured Child trying to get over a restraining gate. They could not understand a single thing the other was saying, but made a little ladder out of each other, and the spanish child crawled over the top. Ran and fetched a stool, handed it to the others and they all ran down the hall giggling together........<br>
First thought in my head was... &quot;Damn, they are only 2 years old and already years ahead of the rest of the world. Shame we cant do the same.&quot;<br>
Does your social surroundings control your thoughts? Or do you control your social surroundings? <br>
So many of us carry the prejiduces of those around us. Why? Maybe we have not heard the other side, maybe we dont know there is one? Or maybe we dont want to know.......<br>
Prejiduces have never gotten anyone anywhere. It only shows that a person is incapable of true thought. To hate an entire race of living people, or religion of living people shows only ignorance. You can dislike what they stand for, or what they look like, but to hate them? <br>
Next time you start to say something about &quot;them&quot; (Them being a race/sex/religion), remember that you dont know each and every one of &quot;them&quot;, and some might be just like you.......<br>
After all, we are all doing the same thing on this planet. Breathing, and trying to stay alive. Work, work, work. Study, study, study. Why? To make parents proud, supply for a family, attain personal goals, etc, etc. There is no diference around the world. We are all doing that same thing.<br>
