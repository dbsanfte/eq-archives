In the past 6 months I have been told on over two dozen occasions that Vaylin would have to help me that I need to petition in his hours online. Then when you petition in the worhtless cocksuckers hours online some guide will answer you and still insist on you telling them you WHOLE @#%$ story from start to finish AGAIN even thoughyou have already been told to see Vaylin, even if you have recieved a reply via email from @#%$. Once you do this you will go in Vaylin's Q and that is the end of it. Go back to @#%$ start and do it all over again you will not get past this step and actually get help from the worthless Dorito eating piece of @#%$ unless you do one of the following:<br>1. Call VI MULTIPLE times insisting,k bitching complaining and reminding them what the CS agreement says.<br>2. Insult his bitch of a mother in tells.<br>3. Have a name that is inappropriate. Apparently of all the bugs, exploits, items, issues, sticks and situations that ONLY Vaylin can help with, this name change bull @#%$ (Which can be done by even a @#%$ basic guide) is his greatest pleasure besides masterbating with visions of high elfs who wont give him the time of day IRL.<br>4. Abuse the game policy so terribly that you get removed then challenge it at Verant and bring Vaylin into the frey. (Yes there are many on the Rathe who have been bonked and fought their way back even with free time for someone at Verant being a dick).<br>To further the issue of getting rid of Vaylin, just firing him flat out and giving us a real GM. It was.. WAS rumored that Vaylin has IRL friends on this server. They use to brag about it out loud but have since calmed a bit. Interesting points to this claim are as follows. The individuals (all in same guild) in question abuse the game in both naming policy, player treatment, KS'ing etc on a DAILY basis. Many of them walk around with names such as Cocck and Kclittorus etc. Many of them end up mysteriously with full suits of quest armor even on their alts in short amounts of time. Most of this could just be good or bad playing but the real issue comes in here. Vaylin has HEARD them say they are his friends on several occasions. Abuses have been seen, logged and /reported and /petitioned. No results. Names thjat OBVIOUSLY abuse game policy are online and using their names like the sex organ they are named after in emotes and phrases to further be crude while Vaylin is in Guk INSISTING that someone with a name that has a &quot;phrase&quot; in it change it like &quot;memunchgnomes&quot;. Where the @#%$ does this worthless @#%$ get off picking and choosing who he likes to change names on and who he will let get away with murder? Do they pay him? Did one of them find a hooker who would agree to finally get this fat piece of @#%$ laid? Solution unknown but the problem remains. There are logs, shots, reports, emails, phone calls, /petitions and more that Verant has recieved about Vaylin. I am sure they recieve many about all GM's but Vaylin is a special case. When Vaylin is confronted about his online friends he ignores the petitions. When they abuse policy and claim you can do nothing about it. Vaylin reads the report, see's the petition and then DOES NOTHING ABOUT IT. Vaylin needs to be fired. This little wortheless live with mom piece of dog @#%$ needs to go find a job he can do without the need for impartiality like cleaning toilets. Verant has recieved my complaints, many others and still failed to respond. <br><br>Now for Larki.<br>Larki you @#%$ dog I hope you read this you little bitch. What? Is your @#%$ mom too god damn cheap to pay ten bucks a month for you to play so you figured you would get a guide account so you can hang out and be a worhtless pile of @#%$ like your mentor Vaylin? Your a dog and you should quit EQ and finish school. Larki has so many people on Rathe pissed or offended by him or his presence he makes Vaylin look like a hard working, honest fair guy. Larki is one of these no life losers too cheap to pay for the game and further too cheap to ever learn anything by trial an error. If you see Larki on the rathe track him down. I do often. I have had people send in petitions (up to 8 serious sounding ones at one time) then gone to following larki around. What does Larki do? he explores. I guess he is looking for places he can get Phat Loots with his @#%$ druid solo on his regular server. If you confronted about why it took so long to get help Larki will tell you &quot; there are many petitions and I answer them as recieved&quot; yet I have watched his sorry ass ignore petitions to wander through 3 zones doing nothing for no one. Larki doesnt like to work either. 90% of the people Larki comes to help he does not, I challenge VI to look at his @#%$ logs and prove this wrong. Larki has his favorite excuses for not helping people they are:<br>1. &quot;I can nnot help you with that issue as it is out of my level of control&quot; Bull @#%$ in a @#%$ shine box you little @#%$.<br>2. &quot;I can not answer anything to do wiht a bug or game exploit&quot; again how does he spew forth this much horse @#%$ from his mouth without having a @#%$ tail hanging over his face?<br>Larki has claimed the first excuse on issues of Players not being able to see their own corpse they were just ressed to, players having corpses in walls, players being stuck in walls, players calling loot stealing on named kills, players being warped into locked parts of zones and more.<br>Larki has claimed his second favorite bugg/exploit bull @#%$ excuse for even more inculding /target petname no longer working, /consent not working, items stuck in a players hand, on and on.<br>Larki does not deserve to be an EQ player let alone a guide. I challenge Larki to find anyone on the rathe that has had a serious issue he has truely been of help with without being forced. They have to be in small number because I cant find them but everytime I mention his name I piss someone off. This flame is really a test, I want to see if anyone actually will stick up for either of these pieces of @#%$. If so great, flame me if you want but I wont be flaming anyone these two actually help. I am glad if someone got some help from them and if they did lets post it so we can see that Vaylin does do something other than jack off, eat dorito's and piss on people who arent his friends or that dont kiss his ass. <br><br>To Vaylin and Larki. I you should be fired, I am in your email box if you want to know who it is, it is one of those people who sent you a @#%$ load of complaints once they realized you never read the @#%$ or respond hardly ever anyway. IF you @#%$ read your email or gave a @#%$ at all you would have at least addressed the issue before we got angry, before our rational thoughts turned to vile cursing and burning hatred. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukamasutra3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KamasuTra3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/27/02 8:02:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.noble-blade.net/images/roadtrip/wizepickam.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Motion to DELETE, Revoke &amp; Fire Vaylin &amp; Larki</span><hr size=1> i like vaylin personally. <p><font size="2" face="arial"><b>Kamasu Ty`Ven</b><br><i>  60th Sorcerer of the Rathe</i><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8575">Profile</a> | <a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a> | <a href="mailto:ben@brock-family.com">Email</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uburnquistm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Burnquist m</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/27/02 8:45:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Motion to DELETE, Revoke &amp; Fire Vaylin &amp; Larki</span><hr size=1> Never talked to Vaylin, or had to deal with him, except for one time.

Sometimes he makes good and fair calls, and then other times he makes decisions which go entirely against decisions he made before. He recently told a friend of mine that a broken quest was fixed, so he should go ahead and try it. Then, when my friend did and lost his quest components cos, haha, the quest was still broken, he refused to help. That's pretty shitty. Then again, I've seen him make calls that were much fairer than some I've seen made on other servers in the same instances, such as cases of hacking and equipment loss.<br><br>Larki, however, is without a doubt the second most malignly least intelligent person I've ever run across, the first who is a GM. His claim that Noble Blade was taking 'renenge' on another guild when we went to kill a dragon that they'd shown no interest in killing has sort of become legend in our guild. 'We shall have our renenge!' is a favored in-joke. Once I was in Chardok and I went LD. I came back naked and at my bindpoint and quickly discovered that everyone else in the entire zone had done the same. Everyone in Chardok at that time had gotten disconnected, and any of them who were in a fight at the time had died. Larki's response? &quot;I cannot offer a GM rez in instances where your connection is at fault.&quot; My connection? Sorry, it was pretty obviously Verant's connection at fault there. And of course there was the time where I under the world and 10k'd at the tunnel from SG in the WW. When I /petitioned, Larki offered me the helpful advice of having a bard or SK try and find my corpse. Then, &quot;We suggest you have a friend try and pull the corpse to a safe location for a rez!&quot; Why thank you, Larki. You moron.<br><br>I honestly dread having to ever /petition anything, especially when I see that there is only one GM or guide on, and that one is Larki. Someone so purely stupid clearly needs poems written about him. <p><link rel="stylesheet" href="http://www.kingkoopa.com/styles/fontbehavior.css" type="text/css"><table width="313" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" height="75"><tr> <td align="left" width="49"><img src="http://www.kingkoopa.com/images/rok-dog.JPG" width="132" height="166"></td><td width="264" align="left" height="7" valign="bottom"> <table width="300" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="2"><tr> <td width="7" bgcolor="#006699"><img name="arrow1" src="http://www.kingkoopa.com/images/bulletpointblue.gif" width="7" height="7"></td><td width="283" bgcolor="#00CCCC" class="mysigtable"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#333333"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1477">Rokvald Dedematshin</a></font></td></tr><tr> <td width="7" bgcolor="#006699"><img name="arrow2" src="http://www.kingkoopa.com/images/bulletpointblue.gif" width="7" height="7"></td><td width="283" bgcolor="#00CCCC" class="mysigtable"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#333333"><a href="http://interealms.com/shaman/">Oracle of Terrible Justice</a></font></td></tr><tr> <td width="7" bgcolor="#006699"><img name="arrow3" src="http://www.kingkoopa.com/images/bulletpointblue.gif" width="7" height="7"></td><td width="283" bgcolor="#00CCCC" class="mysigtable"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#333333"><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a> </font></td></tr></table><b><i></i></b></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/27/02 6:08:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Motion to DELETE, Revoke &amp; Fire Vaylin &amp; Larki</span><hr size=1> I've had nothing but fair/civil treatment from either Vaylin or Larki. <p><p><P><center><TABLE border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#000000" bordercolorlight="#808080" bordercolordark="#000000"><TR>	<TD>		<TABLE>			<TR>				<TD>				<font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">				<center>				<A href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Gromm">Gromm Shatterspine</A><br>				Officer<br>				<A href="http://www.drow.org">Blood of the Spider</A><br>				</center>				</font>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD>					<CENTER>					<A href="http://www.drow.org">					<img src=http://www.drow.org/images/spid.gif>					</A>					</CENTER>				</TD>			</TR>		</TABLE>	</TD>	<TD width="70%">		<TABLE>			<TR>				<TD>				<center>				<A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>				</center>				</TD>			</TR>			<TR>				<TD>					<center>					<A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">					<IMG BORDER=0 WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/8.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?
