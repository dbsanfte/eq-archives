Some of you may not, and may be thinking &quot;hoho, ffs, what is that lamor~ bogfather thinking?&quot; I personally think that the trials are officially one of the worst things I have seen implemented in the game.  Largely, I have been impressed with the PoP expansion - the zones I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>can</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> access are largely good exp, fun, and interesting experiences - and good exp too.  <br>
<br>
But from far away lands, I hear of the Planes of Valor and Storms. I'd like to enter these planes.  I really, really would.  But can I? Hell no.  No planes for you, bog, say the looming Tribunal.  Unless you sacrifice your weekend to sit there, hoping and praying that somebody will invite you, who will actually get to the point where they'll enter the trial, no planes for you.  Now, I'm all for the trials system.  It's a great idea on paper, and might actually require some skill - however, and this is the science part, why is it the executioner has a 30 minute pause in the middle?<br>
<br>
Now, various discussion has lead me to believe that this is because they don't want level 46's in there.  Well, if they don't want level 46 druids in there, there's a much simpler way of sorting that out.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Put a level limit on Justice.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Does that really sound so incredibly hard to do?  If they can do it on planes, they can surely raise it to match one zone, or two zones, or five zones - any zone above the first tier, maybe?  But no.  Verant seem to think that the only way to keep their drooling masses engrossed is by wasting their weekends on timesink after timesink - this will probably get me flamed here, seeing as i've never done the Emp's key, or any real camp beyond my Chardok pipe - instead of letting them have fun.  <br>
<br>
The trials require skill - or at least, more then the usual modicum of farming keys.  However, they are also built around completely <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>shutting out</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> certain classes.  Shadowknights, Paladins, Druids are who I'm talking about.  Ask Kileren, really.  We sat and had a long bitch about it together.  It's a joke how people can and will fuck you over to get the trial done.  The ideal exe group is two wizards, a cleric, a tank (that's a warrior, people, not an SK.  Nobody wants an SK.), an enchanter, and another melee damage dealer.  It is - as i have heard - hard to do the trial otherwise.  <br>
<br>
As to the trials of lashing, fire, etc, how many times have you seen people try them? I've seen one group in the several times i've gone to PoJ (each time around 3 hours of waiting, yes, some people wait 13, hoho~) try the trial of lashing.  That's it.  Nobody else bothers, because it's slightly harder then exe to do the others.  <br>
<br>
Maybe i'll see POV one day, but egads, it'll be in SS's of the mobs that Dalziel sends me.<br>

<br>
I know it's tough bog.. even as a shaman i have a hard time getting a group for the trials because our slows are practically useless and we can't heal during the exec fight. (well we can, heh but i am assuming it would be interesting)<br>
<br>
all we are good for are buffs, and damage.. but druids have better DD's then us, our DoTs albiet a good idea won't do the damage that is required in the 30 seconds to kill the mob before the prisoner gets his head cut off.<br>
<br>
I do like the trials tho.. AND i do like the fact that it requires skill to get into PoV/S. I look at it this way, Verant gave us a zone where we don't have to deal with the average ebayed b00b LFG that is going to get our group killed within 20 seconds. <br>
<br>
I am thankful for that. As for the other classes, it's doable.. you mentioned 5 slots.. the 6th can be for SK's, Pallys, mages, druids, shaman, etc etc etc.. <br>
<br>
I suggest that you get 4 friends together, a cleric, a tank w/AE taunt, a wizard and someone w/high dps (wizard, rogue, monk) and go do the trials. Pick up an extra person and have a go..<br>
<br>
i am pretty sure if you guys know what you are doing you will get it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://krys-art.com/images/sigs/091802.gif"><br><b>

I doubt this is strictly true.  The hard part is mostly on that of doing damage.  And that's not exactly hard...really, a monk doesn't need to do much more then hit his epic button and keep /assisting.  I imagine a rogue might use his duelist (is that it?) ability on the exe maybe...that's not rocket science.  <br>
<br>

Frankly, I'd like to see more people with the sack to try some of the other trials as well, Trial of Stoning should be easily doable with a couple pallys with their group heals.

<br>
It's not the difficulty of the trial that's the issue here, it's the near impossibility for a SK, Paladin or Shaman to get in a pickupgroup doing the trials, unless you form the group yourself. Most people are still with the stuck up images of warriors being the one and only viable tank.<br>
<br>
Also, i found trial of execution insanely more difficult than tanking or pulling in PoV or PoS...Are the planes easy? no, but the reward is well worth it.<br>

While an interesting idea, the implementation needs reworking.<br>
I see no reason why 5 or 10 groups who want to try doing the same trial cant all do it at the same time if they want. They are executable by telling the Tribunal you want to begin, then you are ported to a &quot;cell&quot; to begin. Why cant this cell be created any number of times?<br>
Making players wait in these silly lists for hours on end is just not cutting it SoE.<br>
Timesinks are not the answer and are driving players out of this game. In the last month alone I have seen more than 20 people leave this game environment. <br>
Additionally, the trials should be able to be completed by whoever is in the group. Any Pick up group should be able to do this event, All PoP has done in my opinion is return the need for the Trinity ( Group MUST have warrior, Cleric, Enchanter to succeed in anything you do in PoP).<br>
I am very tired of Timesinks...maybe it is because I have waited a YEAR for a stupid green scale.<br>

You are a leader. Start a group, start off getting some strat together then go for it.<br>
<br>
As for tankage..I love my warrior friends, I really do. But in PoV/S groups I preferr SK or Pallies. As a puller I love that SK and Palllies aggro my inc with stuns and debuffs. Wars always let me take 1 to 2k damage before they get aggro. <p>Brotor Tiller<br>

Druids can easily play healer in the Trial of Execution.  They can also play nuker/AEer with the right spells.  Banishment...works pretty well there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I rest my case on the issue of people being stuck in a narrowminded vision. You do NOT need the 'trinity' to do a decent camp in Valor. Cleric can easily be replaced by a druid or a good shaman, chanter isnt needed as most mobs can be rootparked but is still handy to have around. Paladin, SK can easily tank PoV mobs. Do you need slow? <br>
Yes you do, but there are so many classes that can slow...bard, Beastlord, Shaman, Enchanter, etc... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.vofguild.com/images/dalzielsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Is is SO delightful to be able to go to a zone where I don't have to wonder if the toon playing actually understands how to play their character.<br>
<br>
With the exception of a very small amount of individuals I have been more than satisfied with the skill level of the people I group with in PoV and PoS.<br>
<br>
Trials saved everquest for me.  It's actually fun again, playing with mostly competent people.  Oh and there are plenty of druids, sk's, pallies, etc. in Valor on a daily basis...so...yeah.<br>

On the other hand, no, I have not done any of the trials but when I attain the level where I feel can best support the tank, and not take it in the face for the team, then I'll be ready. I spend my times now lurking in PoN or Poi gaining the exp I need to get to 60 (like you I've worked on alts to get them up to PoP).
