That is fine, what most people in this thread are saying is they don't want to be one of the groups near your group with Notouchie in it, because in all likelihood, your shitty attitude shaman guildie is going to steal their camp or train the crap out of them, and then be a dick about it to boot.  Like who you want, that isn't the issue here.  Notouchie being allowed to get away with his bullshit by the &quot;guild leadership&quot; for as long as he has, is the point.<br>
<br>
Kelsith,<br>
<br>
I *am* a guildleader, and deal with just as many if not more tells while dealing with raids, interguild issues, player disputes etc.  That is no excuse to allow someone who plays a class that has sow, slow, gate, and root being a chronic trainer and STILL wearing an LoM tag.  Notouchie's fouler points are his own and his alone UNTIL it becomes chronic (as it already has) and starts to make the leadership of LoM look bad (which if you can't tell from this thread - it already has).  The upside of all this, is despite Ghalid and Xedd not taking *effective* action, the situation will be resolved.  Since Xedd and Ghalid are incapable of stopping Notouchie from training, KSing and being an all around asshole, the GMs will get tired of soulmarking his account, OR he will learn to stop.  People are tired of the &quot;I lead my guild my way - deal with it because I don't care what you think&quot; attitude going on in this thread, and will start using /report and /petition, as they should.   People are also tired of LoM members and leaders defending game bannable offenses on the part of their guildmember and then wondering why the thread is now more about LoM, when it started about just Notouchie. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>

Ray, personally, I was reading this as entertainment till Xedd lost his grip on reality with the early &quot;my ego eclipses the sun&quot; post.<br>
<br>
I don't know the vast majority of LoM, but anger or not, Xedd's post reflects on the guild just like Kara's post reflects on NB.<br>
<br>
Also, my advice would be to restrain your &quot;is the best shaman on t3h server&quot; to the best shaman in your experience... I can name 6 that have managed to play the A game without being a training ass.. but I would call them the best shamans IN MY EXPERIENCE.<br>

Karadin, I am not saying that people should leave this issue alone. I was just retorting the wildly off base assumptions of Ryzel. I agree with you that no one should act as Notouchie has been accused of doing without repercussions. I, however, disagree on what those repercussions should be. Kicking a guild member out with out at least attempting to reform him is a bad idea. Especially since he is a person that has shown himself to be a friend willing to go a long way outside the call of duty for a guildmember and the guild in general. This is exactly what Xedd and Ghalid are doing. Believe me... they have made progress too. <br>
<br>
The majority of the above posts containing Notouchie horror stories come from a while back near when he first joined LoM. <br>
<br>

<br>
You are honestly saying that all guilds should be run the same way? Personally I'd rather guilds try to reform people instead of just kicking them out and would be disappointed if guild removing people on personal whims became the norm.<br>
<br>
If you read Corso's post. The only reportable thing Notouchie did, according to Corso, was cuss. Running to the zone to save your life has never been a reportable action. Neither is taking mobs from &quot;someone's camp.&quot; He should be kicked out of the guild because he cussed?<br>
<br>
The guild removable offenses, in my opinion (and of course these vary from person to person unless all guilds were run the same way), all took place a long time before this incident even occurred.<br>

<br>
Kelsith,<br>
<br>
Reforming someone shouldn't take years.  Something on the order of 2-3 blatant offenses should suffice for the &quot;reasonable person&quot;.  Especially when said person can sow, slow, gate, and root - no reason for a &quot;skilled&quot; player of said class to train, much less have a reputation for chronic training.  I know my shamans don't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghalidsoulsaver>Ghalid Soulsaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/w/i/wilsonua/pstgif.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Legend of Marr</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/10/02 11:52:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Falconus</span><hr size=1> Karadin you are right, and we have finally dealt with it.

<br>
I agree with Princess Tej,<br>
   If SOTE pulled a stunt like SOT did and stole someones epic mob, or a member was knowen for intentionaly training someone I would be the first to take it to account and consider it. I love my guild but if they condoned actions like noto's I would most likley relocate guilds. Every guild is a group. What one person does reflects on everyone. Reguardless of the countless nice people in LOM Noto's actions towards me in the past and towards others are unacceptable and tend to have me loose respect for LOM.  <br>
<br>
I will stick by my friends till the end. I will stick by my family till the end. That does not mean I will shield them from the concequences of there actions. Sometimes people need to feel the heat to know to stay away from the fire. As a friend I am there to make sure they don't loose there eyebrows. <br>
<br>
Frankly I don't give a crap why people do the things they do. You can never find a beginning to cause. Once your actions have been delt all I care is weither you live up to it or not. Go ahead and train the shit out of me but don't make excuses why you did it. say it &quot;because I was jelious of your tight barb ass.&quot; or &quot;It was an accadent, Want a rub down to make it better?&quot; Usually I just let things go when people are honest. If you don't though expect it to come back to you. Maybe not in eq, but it will come back to you I guarantee it. Maybe someday you can learn to forget about shit and be happy. Till then remember a drunk person will run a stop sign, a high one will stop and wait for it to turn green.<br>
