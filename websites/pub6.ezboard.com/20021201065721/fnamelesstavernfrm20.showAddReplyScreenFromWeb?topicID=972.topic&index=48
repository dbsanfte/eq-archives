I feel that this question is far too vague to warrant a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; response. Would I agree to be drafted if I received a card in the mail to that effect tomorrow? Hell no. There are numerous reasons for this. I disagree with Dubya's insistence on the use of military force in lieu of diplomacy. He has presented no case or sound evidence backing it to the American people. He has failed to define the parameters of such an action and he has failed to ensure that we are commited to establishing a real democracy within that country once we achieve military objectives. I absolutely refuse to fight a war to replace one tyrant with another.<br>
<br>
I disagree with the draft in principle as well. It is a system that forces the poor to fight and die while the rich find ways to safely gain exemption from participation as Clinton, Cheney and Bush show by example. Poor minorities will be the ones least likely to satisfy exemption requirements. Despite some of your feelings on women in the military, forcing only men to go off and die is in itself sexist to begin with. In addition, forcing young men to fight who don't even possess full rights yet is unjust also.<br>
<br>
This is all moot anyways since I am no longer of age to be called. I have no problem with people who would feel compelled to serve there country in a conflict such as this. People have a right to express their own patriotism as they see fit. To label someone as unpatriotic merely because they choose to stand up for their beliefs, religious convictions or personal  welfare is simply dumb. They are labelled conscientious objectors for a reason. People reject the government's desire to wage war on moral grounds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Its a good thing there is a good amount of people that ARE willing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Is it really such a good thing? You're suggesting that people should simply blindly run off to war if the government tells them to. That is foolish. People did just that in Vietnam. The government lied to the American people about our objectives, success rates and failures while continually sending more and more of our youth over there to die. There is no reason to believe that they wouldn't be willing to lie again. Since when did freedom of thought, speech and expression become unpatriotic? A hearty mistrust of the military's willingness to wage war is perfectly justified given past history. I hold the utmost respect for our professional soldiers who serve our country day in, day out and is totally separate from my opinions on current foreign policy.<br>
<br>
If anyone is guilty of making showing patriotism seem like a bad thing then it is you Goosse. You suggest that anyone who isn't willing to kill another human being elsewhere in the world is not devoted to our country and doesn't deserve to be a citizen. That kind of intolerance is what forced people to sail to America in the first place.<br>
<br>
If our country was directly threatened by people rolling tanks onto our soil then I would be the first one to pick up a gun and defend my country from aggression. If the world was truly teetering on the brink of annihilation because war was being waged on a worldwide scale then I would be willing to go in the service of my country. If I am being called to service merely because my country chooses to ignore diplomacy and instead feels compelled to wage wars in multiple theatres at once to achieve full spectrum dominance then I would tell them to go away and learn some diplomacy. If my governments feels compelled to throw me in prison then so be it and I would consider our nation no longer a democratic state but a fascist one.<br>
<br>
The war for oil has nothing to do with our present needs. It has entirely to do with our future, projected needs. There are clearly other motivations for attacking Iraq. I would comment that the needs of the Iraqi people are rather far down the list though.<br>
<br>
I'll leave it at that so that I don't lower myself to name calling as some of you have. I would rather not get into my opinions ultimately on the current Iraqi situation since we already have another thread concerning it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utrindle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trindle</A> at: 9/20/02 3:36:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukuwenfallenleaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KuwenFallenleaf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md96-jma/eq/us.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Peanut Gallery</span><br>  Posts: 2988<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/02 3:37:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=972.topic&index=49>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.interplay.com/bgate2/images2/mainimage1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The war for oil has nothing to do with our present needs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
you obviously didn't read the whole thread where we discussed this already. You think that Iraq is a major producer of the oil we buy which is false. Even if we took Saddam out Iraq would STILL be a part of OPEC and bound by their production quotas. If they did sell to us at a diacount it would piss off the other members of OPEC and they would crank the price of oil up to compensate.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utrindle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trindle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 996<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/02 3:48:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=972.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Hmm I'm not sure I expressed myself clearly or you didn't quite understand my point or maybe both.<br>
<br>
A war for oil in Iraq would not be to protect our current needs. As you and other people have stated, we only get 6% of our oil from Iraq and are really not dependent on them. Iraq's current production levels are not at issue. Oil is ultimately a finite commodity and Iraq is believed to have the largest reserves underneath it once Saudi Arabia is removed from the equation. Some day oil is going to start getting scarce and countries are going to start fighting (arent they already?) over what is left. <br>
<br>
On top of this, there are 6-7 major oil corporations out there and split along nationalist lines. 2 are American, 2 are British, 1 is French, and Russian and China both have their own nationalist interests (I think that is correct..please set it all straight if anyone is an oil expert). These are huge companies with massive clout and resources and want to come out on top when the Iraqi reserves and drilling contracts are divied out. There is also historical issues associated with which oil companies had investments in Iraq that I'm too lazy to lay out that are of interest as well.<br>
<br>
I'm sure some of you will sit here though and say that corporate interests dont affect foreign policy.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utrindle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trindle</A> at: 9/20/02 3:49:13 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern>The Nameless Tavern</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20>Current Affairs</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
