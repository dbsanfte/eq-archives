A chetari wardstaff dropped. All that could use it rolled and I won it. Shorty after this I got bombarded with tells from Leete telling me that I should give it up to someone that is gonna use it and I told her that I would use it but that it would also be used to get me alot of wisdom gear later on when I went to sell it. After all , even though I was gonna use it for a while , I was gonna use it also to get better wisdom gear later on cause I only started with 90 wisdom and at the time I only had 148 wisdom. I kept getting rather nasty tells from Leete about this over and over and it was extremely distressing to even enjoy the raid with someone constantly badgering you about and item while your trying to help with a raid. After dealing with the onslaught of tells for approximately 15 minutes I decided that it would be best for me to just leave and log. Which is what I did. Keep in mind that this was basically my very first raid and that I soloed alot so I was'nt really aware that druids are needed alot for raids after they are done for ports out. <br>
<br>
     I believe that I apologized to all parties invovled in the raid afterwards on several attempts and if I did'nt apologize to anyone there at the time then I apologize now. I honestly dont know what more to say about the matter other than it happened under circumstances that were very foreign to me and I really did'nt handle it quite like I should have but like I said , I was very nieve at raiding then and it was my very first raid. I made a mistake on gating out , that was my fault but I never got an apology from Leete. <br>
<br>
    Zellex , as far as I know is probably one of the most imformative people in a raid I know and of corse whenever he can , I would utilize him for pulling and FDing with the occasional other monk following him around to see how to do it and learn just in case we dont have zellex on a raid. <br>
<br>
    I'm not quite sure you read the whole thing bro but if you see there. I said that of corse whenever I could use him bro. I did'nt make it sound like I was commanding him to be there at every raid. I mean I can be very resouceful when I need to be and with the friends i have that are still wearing SF tags and alot of them in Paralax now I'm sure I can get something going when I need to for a raid. <br>
<br>
    It also seems as if things in the past are coming back to haunt me when the events happened at times when i was very young in the game and did'nt know much about raiding at all. If you have any doubts on wheather or not I've helped anyone. You can ask any CoM member and they will tell you I have helped CoM greatly. After all , I did solo 57 , Every little blue line in it outside rygor fort and I gave away at least about 12 to 20 FULL SETS of rygor armor to my guildmates and to others in the zone that were'nt even part of CoM. I would get a piece and TP to a ring near them and run to them and give it to them and then gate back to my bind outside the fort. <br>
<br>
     Ask Lexi if I gave her a blue diamond bracer for a res ( and this is not the first time I've done this ). I've been anything but harmful for the majority of my 110 days played on Mechy. I have had a couple instances that were considered not very honerable. They were both a very long time ago. I believe that DN raid you were reffering to was last year as a matter of fact. Then again , what person that has played this game has played it 100 percent correct and not been an ass to anyone for the whole time they have played? You find one person that has done that and show me proof and I'll give them 1kpp. Its just not possible. <br>
<br>
     At any rate this is just myself defending my honor at the moment and if anyone would like to say anything else. Please feel free to post about this. I will do my best to respond. Thanks Haemish , I'll get with ya bro on email if I see that most everyone aggrees to me doing this. If ya dont get an email bro. You will know why. Thanks for the responses so far , I look for to seeing more. Thanks CoG<br>

<br>
My previous post was my own personal opinion and beliefs.  Nothing more.  You cannot change what I feel about you Mechy.  Fortunatly you start with a clean slate with most everyone else.  To keep it clean I'm not going to elaborate more unless asked to.<br>
<br>
If you wish to run a raid then do so.  Set it up and run it.<br>
<br>
And it was merely my intent to inform you that Zellex would need to be asked before each raid.  That he doesnt just show up and hes not a CoG resource.  Special arrangements were almost always made for him.  Just bear that in mind.<br>
<br>
[EDIT] As for my liking or disliking anyone.  When I thought about it, I came to the conclusion it doesnt matter.  If I dont like someone its probably because of how they think or act.  But if the point of my stepping down (or one of them) is to encourage new ideas and new ways of thinking and doing things, then perhaps my not liking someone is a pretty good recommendation in and of itself.  I dont know. [EDIT]<br>

I was simply defending myself. I mean you could have just said You dont have my support on this and I would have not said anything more but after what you said I did'nt want anything to get misconstrued by people asking you or anyone else in game about what happened so I tried to clear the air. I mean when you say it like you said it. Your leaving yourself wide open for alot of questions to be asked by others and seeing as how it only affected you indirectly and you would not have the exact details of the incident I figured I would tell exactly what happened so that all could see it. I mean curiousity killed the cat. I just dont need 80 some people coming to me asking me what happened on the raid in DN over a year ago and I especially dont need them coming to a third party who did'nt see the tells I recieved from Leete to try to explain it for me either. <br>
<br>
    I just thought it was in poor taste to leave a cliffhanger like that in a messageboard for all to see and have questions in the back of they're mind as to my worthiness of becoming the raid leader for CoG raids. For the most part , if you were looking to tarnish my reputation as a valid member of a raid , I think you probably succeeded by the amount of views I have seen on this particular thread but then again , I aint gonna let this bother me. I'll get with Haem and set up a raid ASAP and we will see how many show up for it and it will be ran the same if not just as well as the ones in the past. I look for alot to show up but with something like this going on , who knows. <br>
<br>
    As far as Zellex , Like I said if he was around and wanted to , I would utilize him the best I could in a raid. I never said he had to do a thing , just saying if he WANTED to he would be more than welcome bro.<br>
<br>
    Thanks for your time CoG , I look forward to reading more on this thread. Hopefully some good post come to this =). I would like to see at least three people to post something positive on this thread other than Haemish and eqkommisar. Thanks all for reading this.<br>
<br>
<br>
  P.S. Also I forgot to mention that I will not make special arrangements for anyone in a raid. They will all be treated equally just like we are treated in the US.  <br>
