<br>
When you deal with an issue, you lock everyone who complains about it in a room and tell them to suck it up (the forum for Noto's trains). <br>
<br>
You claim to want to keep things civil, and that you do not condone bannable offenses, and yet you have in the past <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and continue now</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to turn a blind eye on your own guild members performing those very offenses. Perhaps it is too much for you to expect your members to match up to the high standards set by your glorious leader...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yeah vince never caused any problems, and you got rid of him just because of that right Karadin?<br>
<br>
Anyways, Notouchie is not an asshole. Many of the times people complain to me about notouchie being an asshole to them its more or less Notouchie is being blunt with them.<br>
<br>
If you are a stupid player, which im going to assume 95% of all people not in LoM are bad players,(sorry about the bias but I can't stand grouping with people). Notouchie when group or duoing or soloing is always going to play the game to his max, he will push to be the best and he will push whoever is in his group to be the best. Is this being an asshole? Nope its called being intense, maybe a little to intense at times but we all get that way. Most of the time people tell me that &quot;Notouchie told me to fuck off&quot; it generally is them translating whatever he said into swear words so that he can get into more trouble. How do I know? Noto takes screenshots and he will send them to me on request. When notouchie does things that are less then nice in game standards he gets the business for it. He doesn't do it over and over and over again its just his personality lends him to be &quot;disliked&quot; by those who jump to conclusions and yes everyone dealing with notouchie will jump to the conclusion that he is a bad guy.<br>
<br>
Right now I challenge anyone posting against notouchie here to seek him out send him a tell ask him to group with you, it will make you a better player. From the most humble person in the smallest of guilds to the guild leader of any of the large guilds. <br>
<br>
As for this thread, I think its just detestable, I have WITNESSED you Corso train someone I know in RL several times at the Valor graveyard after your many failed attempts to quad kite. So I guess the best way to put it is, let he who is without sin cast the first stone, and don't judge a book by its cover. <br>
<br>
If you don't like what I'm telling you, and by you I mean the Rathe community, I don't care. Half the people who have problems with notouchie don't even try to talk to him. <br>

I do not dislike every member of LoM; there are several I actually tolerate and many more I have never interacted with. However, the leadership has become arrogant and xenophobic to the point that they refute the community that is responsible for their very existence.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=43131">Venerable Aesclepius Tiberinus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ilk of Roggulbuk</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Archon ub...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.clanbashemded.com"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.clanbashemded.com/images/clan2.jpg" style="border:0;height:75;width:300;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghalidsoulsaver>Ghalid Soulsaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/w/i/wilsonua/pstgif.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Legend of Marr</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/7/02 4:33:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Notouchie and Tallaared</span><hr size=1> No...Maybe Xedd's comments made in haste and anger but the Leadership as a whole does not exude this arrogance.

<br>
&quot;Now im not a man to rant normally, and im not a troll here either, and normally i would talk to a GL about this, but since Xedd was &quot;doing other things and to phone him&quot; in his Afk, im bringing it here&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all, you bring a complaint here because my GL is AFK ? Gay..<br>
Secondly I didn't walk up to you, I walked up to you and my group who was waiting for me there. Our group pulled **1** mob and we proceeded to killing it. While we were killing the mob we pulled, someone ran out of inner with a one mob train so we yanked it off him to help him out. While we were killing the 2 mobs you wined in say &quot; Will you please leave my camp &quot; 5 6 times while we were just killing the 2 mobs ( we had to kill the 2 mobs before we could move ).. then you started sending me tells to the same effect &quot; Please stop taking my mobs &quot; etc.. I told you &quot; tell my group that &quot; as I had been informed outer cave was ours ( I guess they couldn't tell because you weren't clearing very well ) You kept sending me tells asking to leave after I'd already told you &quot; tell my group &quot; as if you were taking it all out on me; You kept on bugging me over and over after i'd told you to talk with my group which is when I told you to &quot; shut the f*** up &quot; etc. After we killed the 2 mobs our group sat there discussing our options regarding camps as you kept on saying &quot; please leave &quot; repeatedly for no reason and then threatening to petition as we just sat there. Our group decided to move to inner caves since the old group was done after their CR. Btw you forgot to mention whether or not the train was called when I was running out of the caves. It was. And we never went in a 3rd&quot; time; We only whiped out once. <br>
<br>
Your post is filled with many lies and exaggerations which is also pretty gay such as a member in my group saying we were assholes / telling you to find something else to solo / and many more.. well you did screw up ur rant of lies here.<br>
<br>
&quot;I then hit my wrong hotkey and i broke mez, trying to get the mob off the chanter they accused me of KSing, i thought nothing of it. (My Nuke key is next to Innate Camo, didnt see the cast bar going off :/ )&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
I can't believe I almost read over this.This is a classic.. hit the wrong key trying to get the mob off the enchanter breaking a mez.. I like that<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate drama shit&quot;.. another good one<br>
<br>
You say this isn't the first time you've had bad experiences with me. Well I can say the same about you.. You've stolen mobs from a group at inner cave when I was in them, along with 2 of your own guildies. They said you were a fagget. I wasn't even pulling on this occasion, in fact one of your guildies was.. they were very irritated to say the least. I won't mention their names because I don't want them to get into any argument with their own guildies or you over this lame post you made up.<br>

<br>
Someone claimed he was a great soloer and one of the most talented players in the game.  LoM sucks Notouchies dick, and the fact that he is still a part of the guild is proof of this.  A great soloer and talented player would be able to handle his pulls, and if he couldn't he would find a way to handle them.  And if he couldn't handle them he would die respectfully, same deal with a raid, if you get attacked to you run around screaming like a 3 year old bitch?  And train your guild?  No, you stand there and die.<br>
<br>
I have had problems with Notouchie as well, I was soloing in Velks at back wall long time ago.  He comes back, starts pulling mobs, I ask him why he pulled that.  He says, Oh I didn't know you were here.  I tell oh okay, np, have fun.  Ten minutes later he comes back pulls another one.  And I say I am still here bro.  Response fuck off I don't care, I am here for exp.<br>
<br>
There is a reason the initials LoM on our server stand for either ... Legend of Morons, or Low on Manners.  Sucking dicks of people like Notouchie.  I have friends in LoM and I am sorry but even some of you have told me how much you hate him, etc.  And I am not trying to offend you, but as I have said to you many times you should either choose your guilds better or discuss with your guild about fucktards like Notouchie. <p>Extrafth Saliva<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> 61 Ikysaurus Monk<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=110448" target="top">Extrafth's Loots</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=137290">Ralkeem's Loots</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
