Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
 17. Why is my guild not allowed to bring more then 6 people from another posting entity guild to my raid?<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
And the ragefire thing, IS extremely unfair ( no i don't play a cleric) to those people who are not in a guild, this person may have 400 friends in game yet he is not able to be logged in 24/7. How can this be fixed/changed to reflect the 24/7 thing?<br>
Maybe if every guild was on RF alert so that when he popped everyone can be notified  from one zone to the next and people come. This way even the little guilds can obtain a click stick and the guildless clerics can obtain one, mind you the RF would need a list of some sort. Phone numbers can be given so when RF pops someone can phone the next cleric in line. That cleric may miss out that time but won't lose his spot in line. I know this seems alot to ask but it would help alot of people obtain the most sought after epic.<br>
Oh and one more thing... as for the I pay like everyone else thing, I figured I had to put something in there for the whiners since I took out the attacking me for spelling errors and first time poster thing. LOL I think it worked out quite well.<br>

The same way clerics IN a guild do it.  Do you seriously think all those clerics can sit there themselves 24/7?  IF a guildless cleric has enough friends on the server that he/she has completed the rest of the epic, then I'm sure they have enough friends to make sure that cleric stays logged on for a good percentage of the time.  Anyone that has been affliated with the current RF camp knows that none of those clerics are online the entire time.  Those allowances are made by the clerics at the camp.  I agree with whoever posted earlier.. the RF solution may not be the ideal one, but the camp isn't ideal either, and this agreement is what works for the Rathe. <p><img src="http://www.eqvols.com/images/tksig02.jpg" align=center><br>

As far as ANY epic goes, try to get any of them without a guild.  It is possible, if you have the right friends who are probably in a guild, who is helping you get your epic.  Is it unfair to the rest of us that are in small guilds because we cant get into VT or clear NToV?  Hardly.  <br>

<br>
Say two guilds are planable, both have posting rights. Each has a turn that comes up once a month (just for arguments sake). That means that the members of each guild have only one chance per month of epic loot. BUT if the help each other, they can double their chances at that loot. Each one has one a month, so they are really going twice a month.<br>
<br>
By the rules of our system, if an alliance is formed between two guilds, their posting rights are changed to the alliance and not the individuals. So their raiding is done together.<br>
<br>
By making a “secret alliance” you would be giving your members extra chances. The Rathe is about giving equal chances to people, so the rule of 6 was created to maintain this.<br>

<br>
The reason to join a guild is to acomplish goals that one cannot accomplish on their own. Is it possible to gt friends to help with a big quest now and then for a guildless person? Of course it is, but guilds will soon get tired of helping the same person that isnt a member. <br>
<br>
Most guilds have raid loot policies denying applicants and probationary members from aquiring loot on raids until the guild decides that they are useful members of the guild. Why then, would a guild consistantly raid for a nonguilded toon.<br>
<br>
Now, I have, along with my guild, helped MANY nonguilded players as well as those from other guilds, but the focus of my guild is for US to have fun and increase OUR abilities so WE can do new and exciting things...in turn having more fun.<br>
<br>
In short, if you want your epic, join a guild, attend their raids, be friendly in /gu, become a valuable member of said guild, and they will come to you wanting to help on the big parts of your epic.<br>
<br>
As far as the limit of 6 members from a single posting entity, I believe the resaoning is to ensure that a givin small guild isnt reserving a plane for a larger guild so they can be there more often. If you reserve a plane, you need to have sufficient force to enter and fight it, and take the responsibility to ensure that it is cleared (by someone if not yourself). This is really a guess as Ive never seen the reasoning behind this rule, but Im ok with it for this simple reason. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen

As for the ragefire thing. I know I wouldn't give out my station name and pw to someone I met in game. Can a cleric log out and have another toon sit in their place? So if NO- does that mean those people with all the friends who can take ragefire down  still can't acquire his epic because he can't be online 24/7. If YES- then where is it stated they can have another toon logged in for them?<br>
Sometimes people join guilds just for epic purposes and I think I understand why, and thats cause VI made it impossible for someone to obtain it on their own. Especially the plane of sky/air peices.<br>

<br>
One thing:<br>
<br>
I'm almost certain that Broken96 *isn't* Jamany.  Jamany has been a member of our guild with full access to all the game and its content that our guild is capable of (which includes all of the planes), for more than a year. <br>
<br>
Folks may have been quite unhappy about Jamany's style of arguing these philosophical points here during the Great Debate (and I remember it well LOL), but all that was prior to her being guilded first Ring of Dragons and later Evolutia Draconis.  Those of us who have known her and called Jamany guildmate and friend for a long time know what type of person Jamany really is.  And know the absolute unimpeachability of Jamany's motives for asking all those questions way back when, even if the style used was highly difficult for most (and I'm not defending the style, for the record).  At this point Jamany is guilded with more than 100 people, most quite knowledgeable about the server and RTA.  So she certainly doesn't need to come here to ask them, which is why my money says that Broken96 is indeed someone else, someone who has neither lots of experienced guildies to turn to and/or access to content under existing RTA rules.  If you knew Jamany, and I don't care if you do or not, you would not just assume that she was the kind of person to come and cause controversy and argument, just because (unlike many on this forum from time to time) some sick #()$)* consider it fun.<br>
<br>
So give the &quot;Jamany's&quot; a rest OK Ootampa? They are weak ways of addressing the merits of the thread at best and petty personal jabs showing you're a child at worst.  None of us other than the admins have have any way of knowing who Broken96 is.  Even they don't know why this thread has come up yet again after The Great Debate, unless Broken96 tells us why these are issues for him/her.  In any event, the real issue is the points discussed, not trying to eliminate the legitimacy of the questions asked by evoking names for which folks have knee-jerk bad memories from the past.  Most in this thread have done an admirable job of addressing all the questions raised in a mature way, and I agree with the answers.  So there's nothing for me to add on that.<br>
<br>
Thanks for hearing me out.<br>

The poster has valid points, sure, which would be just as true if their real name was used. Perhaps I will take comfort knowing we are addressing the points, and not the poster.<br>
<br>
A note about guilds and epics:<br>
<br>
The only epic I can brainstorm out that a person can do while unguilded, is the rogue epic, and that is only due to the occasional general mass deaths that are engineered on the general boards by a guild or three. As far as I know, the general is the only fight that requires more than 8 or 9 people.<br>
<br>
So barring that as the example, I'm gunna have to say that epics are approaching end game content, and that some content just cannot be reached without a guild. <br>
<br>
No matter *how* far the game goes into the future, you will *never* see a pick up raid on some zones and places, at least not a successful pick up raid. You will never see people shouting that they need more for the Cursed, for example, in the Bazaar. Or at least you won't until that content is trivialized by level cap or equipment or skills. Long time off, in any event.<br>
<br>
There is a line in the game where wiping out against a mob is not called wiping out. It becomes &quot;refining your tactics&quot;. It is at this point that the line between what you can do without a guild, and with a guild, is drawn. <br>
<br>
Ragefire is, at best, a weak example of a camp you cannot do without a guild. At best, it's actually a good example of an epic *step* that you don't need a guild to get done. Here's why.<br>
<br>
When ragefire pops, it is a server wide event. What do I mean? Well, it's like this: When ragefire pops late at night, you've got people all over the RTA's who have said &quot;If any members of my guild are online, give us a tell, we'll help&quot;. Quite frankly, an unguilded cleric need only have made a friend or three, and not have been a general ass during their 50+ levels, and even though unguilded, could call in the calvary in *much* less than our grace 12 hour convention. <br>
<br>
On Aesclepius's ragefire we had members of BotS, SoT, Tindi, Knights of the Iron Cross, and our own guild. The assembled group would have been enough to take the mob down, without anyone from Clan Bashemded being there. That was 25 minutes after the pop. <br>
<br>
Any cleric who has made 50 levels, has grouped with many people. If they have any redeeming social qualities at all, they've made friends and influenced people. Ragefire is likely the *only* mob that people will come all over the server for, if they hear the call for help. It is the only epic that is in everyones interest to see more of, really. <br>
<br>
I'll go out on a limb here and say that people who do not have any redeeming social values at all, don't deserve their epics, cleric or otherwise.<br>
<br>
Now, about why I said ragefire was an epic *step* you could do without a guild. Ragefire is *not* by far the hardest part of the cleric epic. Quite frankly, it is an overexaggerated Lord Begurgle spawn. What's that? Well, for both, you wait in a zone, for an inordinate amount of time for the difficulty of the mob you are fighting. Killing the mob after he pops is not really the issue: waiting there long enough to get the mob is the problem. <br>
<br>
No, the part of the cleric epic you can't do without a guild is *the king in chardok*. <br>
<br>
I would, personally, rather cut parts of my own anatomy off than go to a pick up royals raid. Maybe if I was a necromancer, with my own way to get my bodies out, that would be differant. <br>
<br>
Bottom line: Some content is reserved for those who have a group of people to back them up, and it's apparent throughout the entire game, large scale to small scale and everything in between. <br>
<br>
Hell, some content, you can have a great guild, and still not get to. Some content, you have to be *the* best. Vex Thal anyone?<br>
<br>
Bottom line: you can get fairly far in this game without a guild, so long as you have friends. You can kill ragefire, or have ragefire killed for your epic, without a guild easily. <br>
<br>
Want to see the higher end stuff than epics? Sorry, you have to have a group of people who have closer ties than just &quot;hey, I saw you in seb once.&quot; Nothing can be done about that: Verant *can't* put high end content on low end mobs: That would *suck* for risk vs reward. Verant can't make a 'high end' that's designed for a group of 6: anyone with a raid of 30 would run over it and trivialize the encounter. <br>
<br>
/panic off about ragefire. Anyone that can get the king note, can get Ragefire dead. If you can't get the king note, you have no business trying to get a Ragefire piece: rotting hearts help no one. <br>
<br>

<br>
Rog - (the reason for this post) How about a quest that generates a key (rare mobs, multiple locations, random spawns, common drops).<br>
You gather up a group of 6 go click on a stone (with your key) and your group is ported to a small dungeon which cannot be entered other than with that key, and the gem goes dark on the outside once a group enters making it impossible for another group to enter until the first group is out. A timer is started from when the gem is clicked on and all who enter the dungeon will be ported out in a fixed time. Spawns also are generated in the dungeon once and a boss mob is at the end which drops some item which is the goal of the encounter (which is no drop).<br>
<br>
This is the type of content which I hope for in PoP and it has been alluded to in many ways. Certainly would add some life to the game for single groups. <p><p>

/you camp - you come back at the exit spot outside the zone<br>
/you cannot bind<br>
<br>
The quest to generate the key is the prohibitive bottleneck to those who do not want the item bad enough. The difficulty of the boss mob dictates the power of the item.<br>
<br>
The dungeon could be the same design with different spawns depending on the key that is used.<br>
<br>
Just a thought. Dont mean to keep mr.anon thread going by sparking it with real content but I felt like posting.<br>
