So if he does drop the loot you posted, then I would have to say that AD could be considered a Mob with desireable loot and falls under the Rotation consideration.  Of course people can still do the quest as an option of continuing to the next plane.  I believe that If AD or the other mobs drop desired loot, then there is a possibility that it could be permacamped, and thus teamed guilds to be able to Permcamp it(Just a possibility). <br>
<br>
I don't think anything was done wrong earlier since there was no clear ruling on this kind of Mob, and I doubt either guild will be camping him for the loot anyway. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=286161" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dembire Deadbones</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

(This is a yes or no question only)<br>
<br>
If as I suspect the answer is at this time (and the time that the mob was taken down) is NO, it is not a rotation mob.  Then the &quot;No Teaming Rule&quot; does not apply.  Its that simple.<br>
<br>
The No Teaming Rule as has been said many times, applies to rotation mobs only.<br>
<br>
If AD is being considered for Rotation, make up your minds and either put the blasted mob on it or not.<br>
<br>
Allowing teaming here does not allow for teaming on Rotational Mobs, we have not disagreed with you here,  bases on what I get from the posts here, we don't have a problem with the no teaming rule on the rotational mobs, we can live with that, its been stated.<br>
<br>
Here is a question.   <br>
Who EXACTLY has access to this RTA channel?<br>
I know the Admins do, but who else?  Heck I don't know who all the admins are honestly... I know Rog is, but that is the only name I know.<br>
<br>
What would happen if say, several of the smaller guilds go together and killed this Mob, none of us being posting entities or on the rotations.   How would we know it was against the rules sense we don't have access to the RTA channel to see how the ... don't have a proper word for it....I'll just use RTA admin for it... How would the RTA admin (meaning the people who have access to the channel) handle this?  <br>
<br>
Gromm (hope i got the name right)  BOTS person.<br>
For the most part, I like your posts, they are thought out and unbiased.  You have at least acted like you are willing to hear people out, even if it isn't the topic that started this thread.  I thank you.<br>
<br>
And its several pages back now...but who ever said that I won't get my lvl 57 butt into the PoTime, who the heck said I wanted in a Teir 5 or 6 zone, I lost track of what that was.  I don't plan on going beyond Teir 3, probably even getting into Teir 3 until I've got lvl 60 or better. <p>Keana Silverwolf&lt;br&gt;<br>

All of a sudden, a mob appears that's only circumstantial difference is that you can kill it or quest it, your option, to get something it drops.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Suggesting a rotation on a mob that is neither hunted exclusively for his tangible items nor is, more importantly, contested on anything close to a regular basis is, I say, going against the spirit of the RTA.  Will he ever be pharmed primarily for the items he drops (to the point that he is contested), rather than the access to the zone he provides?  You know what, I don't know ...I'm not a psychic ...but right now, today, he is not killed for his tangible items, he is killed for the flag ...a flag that can be quested for individually over a much longer period of time ...a flag that for all intents and purposes only needs to be done very very few times by each guild ...and any attempt to control by rotation the killing of that mob (awarding of that flag) can only be seen as a means to slow the progression of anyone wishing access to the zone in question.  If ...and I say IF because the sheer possibility is in question ...IF AD is ever <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>contested</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> primarily for his tangible loot table, THEN and only then should he be a candidate for rotation.  That is simply not the case right now.<br>
<br>
The problem we have here is not that people are saying 'teh rotations is teh suck on AD&quot;, excluding your personal whipping boy Dytren.  I think most of us agree with the rotation system in principle, but the only legitimate reason for suggesting AD be added to a rotation right now is the fact that a couple of guilds teamed up on him, beat him, and OMG he has to go on rotation now so that we can enforce the 'no teaming on rotation mobs' rule.  That's it.  Let's extrapolate a minute:  'teh rotations is teh suck on AD when it is only being placed on rotation to keep us newbs outta the ubah zones'.  I'm getting pretty good at this extrapolation crap.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So, the issue is that<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes, folks say &quot;it's only for this mob&quot; - famous last words.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The only person I see extrapolating anything is ...well ...you.  If this is such a concern for you ...rotate all of the other PoP mobs that offer flags, but who do not offer an alternative means of questing for that flag (as was suggested by Sladen).  This is a reasonable compromise that most people are willing to live with.  Aerin'Dar, Grummus, Behemoth would remain FFA and teamable ...while every other PoP flag mob can be governed by RTA rotation rules (non-teamable) and you can be their Lord and Master.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The first &quot;official&quot; rotation was Trakanon. When Talendor was killed, the rules for the Trakanon rotation were extrapolated to extend to Talendor (basically it was search-n-replace &quot;Trakanon&quot; with &quot;Talendor&quot; and *poof* you have the new rules).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Putting the chicken before the egg again?  You should say,&quot;...when Talendor was placed on rotation, he inherited the rules that governed the previous Trakanon rotation...&quot; other wise you completely miss the point.  The difference here is that you are attempting to give rotation rules to a mob that is not on rotation.  No one is arguing that, should a rotation be set up for AD, what the rules would be when that occurs ...we assume that he will inherit the same rules as all other rotation governed mobs.  The argument is whether or not AD NEEDS TO BE ON ROTATION AT ALL.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you cannot see our side of the argument then we are at an impass. I assure you that we see yours and take it into consideration when we form our opinion on the matter. You need to convince me (and others) that this isn't simply a foot in the door. I will say that the qualification (similar to what has been given already) of something like:<br>
<br>
&quot;Mobs that enable entry into further zones when killed - whether by dropping an item which enables entry either directly or by completing a quest for such a key, giving character flags, or by any other means not specifically mentioned here - that can also be bypassed by quests that provide an alternate path to entry to the further zones but the quest does not require killing said mob to complete the alternate-path quest, which also have been proven to not stir any interest because of other items that they may drop and, because of this, have been proven to remain &quot;up&quot; for long periods of time, are open to FFA rules.&quot;<br>
<br>
is a little better.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Did you write this or just throw it up on a piece of paper?  Can you translate for me what it says?  I think you are making this entirely too difficult.<br>
<br>
First, since when has any RTA rule been written in such a purposefully confusing way?  Me thinks you doth jest, otherwise you have completely and utterly lost sight of the topic of this conversation and I would truly have to question whether you see 'our' side or not.<br>
<br>
Second, since when does the RTA make rules for FFA mobs?  We don't have a rule that says &quot; blah blah blah ...Gorenaire is open to FFA rules&quot;, do we?  What, exactly ARE FFA rules anyways?  How can anyone enforce &quot;Free For All&quot;?  lol<br>
<br>
The RTA doesn't need to do anything ...period, zip, zilch, nada.  Let's face it, by your own admission, you do not care if an FFA mob is teamed.  Currently, Aerin'Dar, Behemoth, and Grummus are all FFA ...hence they can be teamed for the purpose of flagging.  No amount of whining and crying here on the RTA boards can make that any less of a fact than it already is.  However, to address your concern that this 'precedence' is not carried over (on purpose or by accident) to all other PoP flag mobs (and therefore, be able to team all the way up the ladder), then it would be advisable that you place all the other PoP flag mobs on their own separate rotations.  Once on rotation, those other PoP flag mobs will inherit the rules and established written conventions of all other rotation mobs ...i.e. alliance rules.  Problem is solved.<br>
<br>
Does it get any simpler than that?  We have a workable compromise ...concerns from both sides are covered ...most everyone is happy (minus those people who are wanting to put AD on rotation for the sole purpose of denying access and content to other guilds ...they won't be too happy, I'd guess).<br>

a) and b) do not derive c) here.  The mob may have amazing items that are even better than access to other areas and everybody wants the items - thus requiring a rotation, something that has been failed to be addressed yet again.  Remember, I am NOT talking about AD or whoever you choose to use as your example.  I'm talking in general -- maybe some future mob down the line.<br>
<br>
I think what you want is:<br>
<br>
Concerning Aerin Dar:<br>
a) Because the mob drops keys everytime (the number is no consequence) to grant access to another zone,<br>
b) Because you can also quest a key to give access to this same other zone,<br>
c) Because the items that the mob drops are of no consequence to anyone (although this is quite subjective),<br>
d) As evicence of a), b), and c) there has been no contention for this mob as of yet as evidenced by the fact that no formal request for rotation on these mobs has been offered to-date by anyone,<br>
e) Then the mob doesn't require rotation and, therefore, no rules, which allow teaming up on the mob in any form desired.<br>
f) However, it may be in the future that a rotation needs to be in effect on this mob, if contention increases to the point some guild/group requests it.<br>
<br>
Then, this can be similarly applied (or inherited if you like) by any other mob having similar properties in the future.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The only person I see extrapolating anything is ...well ...you. If this is such a concern for you ...rotate all of the other PoP mobs that offer flags, but who do not offer an alternative means of questing for that flag (as was suggested by Sladen). This is a reasonable compromise that most people are willing to live with. Aerin'Dar, Grummus, Behemoth would remain FFA and teamable ...while every other PoP flag mob can be governed by RTA rotation rules (non-teamable) and you can be their Lord and Master.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Idiotic rhetoric aside, I personally have no problem with the compromise either, as I've stated many times.  I've stated my concerns repeatedly and they aren't about ownership of anything.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Putting the chicken before the egg again? You should say,&quot;...when Talendor was placed on rotation, he inherited the rules that governed the previous Trakanon rotation...&quot; other wise you completely miss the point. The difference here is that you are attempting to give rotation rules to a mob that is not on rotation. No one is arguing that, should a rotation be set up for AD, what the rules would be when that occurs ...we assume that he will inherit the same rules as all other rotation governed mobs. The argument is whether or not AD NEEDS TO BE ON ROTATION AT ALL.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I disagree.  Although no one had killed Talendor ever, the guild that killed Talendor did go by the rules as if the mob had been on rotation.  That is, they did not get every guild on the server together and kill it, then say that we have to all do it as seperate guilds.  They EXTRAPOLATED the rotation rules to Talendor and killed Talendor as if it had been on rotation (they killed it with only their guild, no teaming) and continued to kill it as such until another guild also killed it as if it had been on rotation (only their guild, no teaming, etc) and then established a rotation INHERITING the rules from Trakanon.<br>
<br>
Again, my discussion has nothing to do with AD.  It is about precedent and clarity.  I don't care if you are talking about AD or Emperor Crush.  The mob name in question is simply circumstantial.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Did you write this or just throw it up on a piece of paper? Can you translate for me what it says? I think you are making this entirely too difficult.<br>
<br>
First, since when has any RTA rule been written in such a purposefully confusing way? Me thinks you doth jest, otherwise you have completely and utterly lost sight of the topic of this conversation and I would truly have to question whether you see 'our' side or not.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I wrote it on the fly.  It was somewhat tongue-in-cheek but I wanted to show that you need to nail down the qualifications and not just gloss over it or someone in the future (probably about 8 months from now if history is any indicator) would simply say &quot;MobX is done this way, why isn't MobY&quot; and no one would know why there is a difference.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Second, since when does the RTA make rules for FFA mobs? We don't have a rule that says &quot; blah blah blah ...Gorenaire is open to FFA rules&quot;, do we? What, exactly ARE FFA rules anyways? How can anyone enforce &quot;Free For All&quot;? lol<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
See the above text on extrapolation vs. inheritance.  FFA means that there are no rules, even to the point of multiple simultaneous engagements are allowed and the killing blow wins it.  Most prefer the term FCFS (first come, first served).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The RTA doesn't need to do anything ...period, zip, zilch, nada. Let's face it, by your own admission, you do not care if an FFA mob is teamed. Currently, Aerin'Dar, Behemoth, and Grummus are all FFA <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, this is where you are wrong.  The point that I (and others) are trying to make have nothing to do with any particular mob.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>However, to address your concern that this 'precedence' is not carried over (on purpose or by accident) to all other PoP flag mobs (and therefore, be able to team all the way up the ladder), then it would be advisable that you place all the other PoP flag mobs on their own separate rotations. Once on rotation, those other PoP flag mobs will inherit the rules and established written conventions of all other rotation mobs ...i.e. alliance rules. Problem is solved.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That may solve the &quot;how&quot; but not the &quot;why&quot;.  You have set up no qualifications as to why those mobs are treated differently that are convincing.  Above I give you your out.<br>
<br>
Again, I have no problem with AD/Grummus/Behemoth being FFA even provided there are clear and concise reasons why they are allowed to be whatever they are and how they are different from every other case in the game and why that warrants the difference in treatment.  I have convinced myself why they are OK to be FCFS and how to differentiate between any future mobs so that creep doesn't destroy valid rotations a while back.  I've given you the criteria to convince me above, without using leaps of faith instead of logic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eqashke>EQAshke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/9/03 5:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=165>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.  </span><hr size=1> Thank you, Gromm for finally including a solution to something in one of your long winded answers.

<br>
With that stated is AD contested enuff to  put it on a rot? And if on said rotation then it needs to be killed within a 24 hr time period.<br>
<br>
If enuff interest to put this on rot then it better be dead within 24 hr by the guild up for it.<br>
<br>
That being said are any of the guilds wanting this on a rot willing to make sure it's dead within 24 hrs?  If not then it should  stay ffa and anything goes for killing it teaming or not.  <br>
<br>
This goes for all mobs in pop and is how all other rotation mobs are handled.  Pop mobs should be handled the same way. If a mob isn't contested then why is this a big deal?<br>
<br>
If mob is not contested and on a rot it goes against our convention whatever u wanna call it. Not the other way around like u have been stating.I can think of many FFA mobs that are by for more contested then AD<br>

I'm saying that it is possible that someone would want to kill it for his items, not only the flags. You are saying that is not likely. I may agree with you really, but you cannot simply say that it will not likely happen. At least you do address the possibility, finally.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I am saying it is not likely to the point where Aerin'Dar becomes a point of contention, perma-camped in the way that mobs like Sev would be if he were to go FFA ...oh, sorry, FCFS.  I don't know ...I will be the first one to admit that I don't know if they will ever need to be rotated in the future, but here's an idea that hasn't been put forth yet:  If Aerin'Dar, Grummus, and Behemoth are so much in contention (for any reason, but above all because of their loot table) so that a suggestion has been set on the table that they become rotation mobs now...why aren't they rotation mobs already? How come 1) AD was up for 3 days prior to the CB\VoLS raid on him, and 2) how come none of them are on a rotation yet??  There has been, what, 7 (guessing, I don't know) guilds kill them already and moved on?  Rallos Zek has exactly 2 guilds on his rotation ...how come RZ is on rotation and not Aerin'Dar, Behemoth, and Grummus?  Surely you had to do Aerin'Dar, Behemoth, and Grummus first ...this is, after all, a linear game.<br>
<br>
If this whole situation is truly how you see it and not how I see it ...then I gotta tell you, your timing sucks.  Suggesting that a mob go on rotation in the same sentence you are questioning whether or not it is 'frowned upon' to team a flagged mob has a + b = c written all over it.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The mob may have amazing items that are even better than access to other areas and everybody wants the items - thus requiring a rotation, something that has been failed to be addressed yet again.

If those mobs become contested in the future (6 or 8 months from now?), I'll be the first one to walk up to each of them and whack them over the head with the rotation stick.  I fail to see, though, how is it that putting a mob on rotation based on the assumption that something might happen be more right than not putting a mob on rotation on the assumption that it won't?<br>
<br>
I AM talking about AD ...and peripherally Grummus and Behemoth ...why aren't you?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Concerning Aerin Dar:<br>

<br>
Also ...dealing with symantics here ...but c) should read &quot;Because the tangible items that the mob drops are of no PRIMARY consequence to anyone&quot;.  You are either there to kill AD primarily for his flag, or you are there primarily for his loot table.  <br>
<br>
And, d) ...I have no idea what to do with this sentence other than to remove the last portion (does a formal request for rotation imply that the mob IS in contention?) and replace with the fact that he has thus far been spawned for several days prior to being killed.<br>
<br>
...of course, submitting that (and I'm still kind of wondering why in the world you have actually submit a request to keep a mob OFF ROTATION) simply means that someone who has killed Aerin'Dar (and probably Grummus and Behemoth ...you, perhaps?) will just come right behind and make a formal request that those three mobs be placed on rotation ...which in fact they will be because making a formal request implies that the mob is, in fact, in contention when, in fact, it isn't ...<br>
<br>
So, to counter that, I would have to put in:<br>
<br>
g) in distinction of item b), should this mob be placed on rotation, a further exemption will be set forth allowing an alliance of guilds to team up on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>this mob only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for the purpose of receiving their flag; however, any further attempts on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>this mob</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for the purpose of additional flagging or for purposes of loot must be accomplished by that alliance as one rotation entity.<br>
f) following current alliance policy, any break up of an alliance will result in the alliance being removed from the rotation, and each guild must each kill the mob separately to be placed back on the rotation.<br>
<br>
There ...I'm happy with that.<br>
<br>

With the introduction of flags, the raid system, and PoP in general, the game has changed and you need to accept that some of your 4 year old rules are gonna have to change with it.  What may have applied to Trakanon 4 years ago does not work with Aerin'Dar of today.  Trakanon has ONE key ...Aerin'Dar has 72 keys.  There is no longer a &quot;one rule fits all&quot; environment.<br>
<br>
Does it not bother you that clearly 70% (pulled that figure outta my ass, in case you are wondering) of this entire server population will never get to see some of the content you see now?  I am certainly not suggesting that we hand anything over to anyone ...but you know what, as a community, it is your duty (otherwise, what does this so-called 'community' exist for?) to think about the whole, rather than the me me me all the time.  Now, I see it as no big thing that you loosen the rotation noose a little bit on PoP flag mobs to allow guilds that may never see more than 30 or 40 people to team up with another equally member-desolate guild to get a flag and experience a new zone.  They still have to earn it, just like you did ...they still have to get flagged to even attempt the flag mobs we are talking about ...and they have to figure out how to go from there on their own because the remaining flag mobs are rotated with the 'no team rule' in effect...but their 72 people from two (or three or four or whatever) guilds is no more or less different than the 72 people your guild can pull together at an instant's notice.  The 'no teaming' rule ...rotated or not ...on Aerin'Dar, Grummus, and Behemoth needs to go.<br>

Funny, I haven't thought of &quot;me me me&quot; at all.  In fact, I keep stating that I don't care if you walked up, pat AD on the head, and he gave you a key.  It wouldn't matter to me if a GM sat there and handed out keys all day long to anyone who hailed him.  I wouldn't care if you didn't have to have a flag to get into HoH.<br>
<br>
I simply refused to say &quot;let's do it this way and if the other situation ever came up, we'd think about it then&quot; as you seem so ready to do.  I said we should think about it now and at least have a plan in place just in case.  This seems to go along with what other people are saying about being clear instead of leaving things up for interpretation on the fly.<br>

<br>
I guess the 2+ hours for 2 loots from FR or the 2 loots from Xegony in 3+ hours would also mean that these other mobs that give keys but have poor risk/reward should be done this way too?  We could have wiped out all of PoWater and gotten more stuff of near-equal quality.  I guess we shouldn't keep killing those mobs because we can be more efficient elsewhere... according to your logic.<br>

The fact is that Risk vs Reward on this mob is not great, especially when you consider two seperate entities having to work together.  Therefore, if the Risk Vs. Reward isn't there loot wise(his loot is good, but its nothing spectacular that was never seen pre PoP), then there is no other reason to go after him other than flags.   <br>
<br>
As far as your point.  Obviously, your guild has determined that the risk vs reward factor for Xegony and FR is far better then that of PoW, else you wouldn't be doing it.  If the Risk/Reward was there on AD, you guys would've permakilled him and then set up rotation when some other guild was able to get him.  <br>
<br>
To address your main issue; as far as I am concerned, we have a plan in place on the Rathe.  Highly contested mobs are set up on rotation, in which case rotational mobs can only be done by one entity or a pre-determined alliance.  This mob is neither highly contest, nor is it a mob that guild(s) have killed repeatedly just for loot.  Therefore, it was not set up on rotation the first 30+ times he was killed.  Just like any other similar mob, it should stay off rotation because it doesn't meet the requirements.  If anything, a mob such as lodi should be put on rotation when compared to this mob.  At least, IT is highly contested and doing so would add to the civility of our server.  <br>
<br>
As I did earlier; I'll make a rash comparision.  Back when LoM/FK killed Rotational mobs together, did you require them to kill every other mob as an alliance(non-rotational)???  No, you did not.  Therefore, you(as in the rule writers/admins) of the Rathe set precedent.  Surely, with PoP comes a few different changes, but none in which the previous precedent should be overturn.  If something is done, you will be slapping every guild in the face simply because you've decided to cast skepticism on the trustworthy. <br>

BotS does not perma camp a mob to &quot;cockblock&quot; anyone. Our viewpoints on this rotation thing are not about that at all, nore are they about trying to keep our playgrounds to ourselves. <br>
<br>
Ask Tindi if you dont believe us. If we had really wanted to &quot;cockblock&quot; as you have said we would have killed RZ instead of letting Tindi have a week alone learning and fixing strategies. On that same note, ask Tindi how many times since they have entered the planes if we have interfered at all with any mobs they have been going after. Their answer will be none. <br>
<br>
Tindi and BotS have coordinated and worked together well since Tindi has entered the planes, and we will continue to do so with them and anyone else that gets there. But we will only do so if you get their on your own. If you use alliances to get to our playground as its been called, dont expect us to respect that alliance on mobs there. <br>
<br>
On a last note. All of the guilds complaining about not having a say on mobs they have not killed really dont have a leg to stand on right now. We on the Rathe have never asked the other guilds how we should set up things for mobs before as far as rotations go with mobs, why should we do so now? By the reasoning im seeing on some of these posts, BotS and Tindi should start asking all guilds their opinions when it comes to planar mobs rotations due to the fact that someday your guild will be doing those also. This simply isnt going to happen, nor is it a feasible option.<br>
<br>
If you want a say on rotations and such, earn it like the rest of us did and kill mobs on your own.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lukieb2>Lukieb2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member User</span><br>  Posts: 659<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/10/03 2:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=173>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.  </span><hr size=1> Triv, My post was not intended to have any negative connotation about BotS.

After getting involved in this discussion, you would be surprised at how little I would expect from you.  <br>
<br>
It has only been proposed that the alliance rule for rotation mobs be modified to allow teaming of smaller guilds on EXACTLY 3 flag giving mobs to allow access to EXACTLY 3 additional zones.  Anything and everything other than those 3 mobs can ...and should be governed by the existing 'no team' rule, once they have been placed on rotation.  You are still paranoid that someone can team all the way up the ladder?  Let me give you a bit of information ...there is absolutely nothing ...and I mean nothing ...keeping two guilds whose primary focus is to enter the elemental planes to form an alliance, renew all their old world rotations as an alliance ...and team up all the way to your precious playground.  Scary, huh?<br>

<br>
The community as a whole is more than welcome to talk about and propose general rules regarding rotations or server rules or whatever else, but rotation rules should always be determined by the guilds that are on a rotation.<br>
<br>
A guild that joins a rotation is more than welcome to have input into the rules of that rotation and ask the guilds involved to vote on it, but why should you vote on that rotation if you have nothing to do with it.<br>
<br>
Are you going to suggest the amount of time a guild should have to clear Vex Thal when they are up for it? Or which mob counts as giving rotational access to Vex Thal?<br>
<br>
The entire idea of joining a rotation is that you are breaking into that rotation. Now in most circumstances, many guilds are willing to give a guild who asks a shot at the mob, but in some cases they may not. This is where racing to that mob may be necessary. You don't have the right to call for a rule change to a rotational mob just because it might make it easier for you to join that rotation.<br>
<br>
There is absolutely no logic in asking for a vote by the guilds of the server each time a new rotation is set up. The majority of the guilds would be voting on issues they knew nothing about. If an issue affects two or three guilds only, then why would it be necessary for twenty guilds to vote on it? Seems slightly absurd to me.<br>
<br>
There is absolutely no way to argue that having rotations slows down the progress of up and coming guilds. As has been stated thousands of times before, rotations give guilds who are capable of killing a mob a guaranteed chance to kill that mob every x amount of time. If there were no rotations then sure, some guilds might get to kill one mob more often, but they would also probably lose out on other mobs that they wanted to kill.<br>
<br>
What you currently see is that when a guild decides a rotation is no longer valuable to them, they move to autopass on it. This means there are more kills available to the guilds still on the rotation, as well as new ones joining it. However, if there were no rotation rules, it is quite likely that many rotation mobs would get killed by small groups of people in big guilds whenever they found them up to equip alts or make cash etc.<br>
<br>
Many people seem to cry foul of the bigger guilds who are supposedly stifling their chance to grow and access new content. It is not logical to argue that BotS was able to do so well because they got to kill content with no competition for so long, and thus because of rotations, smaller guilds can no longer able to grow as fast because of this. Surely everyone can see that the prize of working hard and getting there first is to have little or no competition on content. It has always been the case in EQ that if you are ahead of the curve you will have more opportunities than those below you.<br>
<br>
This thread has nothing to do with people saying that what CB and VoLS did was against the rules. It wasn't, and that is exactly what this thread is about. Most of those who have killed Aerin`Dar by themselves are not happy with the situation of guilds teaming up on non rotation mobs then killing their rotation mobs as seperate entities. The idea here is to try and establish a set of rules that is fair for everyone and doesn't create any double standards as currently exist.<br>

This &quot;community&quot; has not taken into consideration the smaller guilds, and in most cases, even the mid-sized guilds.<br>
<br>
I will never support PoP flag mobs being on a rotation, nor will I frown upon teaming up to get flagged for higher level planes.  In the end, if two guilds team up to get into a plane, they still have to survive in that plane on their own.  I don't think you will be seeing Far Seekers taking on Solusek Ro anytime soon, but we would do fine in the 3rd tier planes, and possibly higher.  If the elite guilds on this server want exclusive access to certain content, simply go where the lower-tier guilds cannot go yet (Elemental Planes, PoTime).<br>
<br>
This is not intended to be a flame, by any means (I seldom post here, and those who know me would know better).  However, I don't see too many different ways to read this situation, when it's the high-powered guilds making such a fuss over other people experiencing public game content.  If &quot;cockblocking&quot; is the term of choice for many here, I can certainly understand that viewpoint.  I really can't classify the counter argument as anything but elitism.<br>

In the two weeks of access to HoH that CB has had, I have seen someone from that guild in the zone once . . . and there were 45 of them total.  HoH isn't a BotS playground.<br>
<br>
The question here isn't how rotations are set up, who decides rotation rules or the value of rotations to the smaller guilds.  All of this is obvious.  <br>
<br>
Rotations are nothing more than formalized agreements between the people killing a given mob (not necessarily those that CAN kill it) that there is greater demand for than avaiability.  A rotation rule, thus, can be changed if agreed upon by all members of that rotation.  For example, if all 4 or 5 members (too lazy to look atm) of the Dozekar rotation wanted to make the rule regarding names that they can be killed by the guild up for Dozekar from the day he spawns until the day the next spawns, we could do so . . . provided we all agree.  This is the reason that United Necros has no say in the RZ rotation.  <br>
<br>
The true question here is whether rotation rules can be applied to mobs that are not on rotation.  I would tend to favor the opinion that they shouldn't apply, but I see the point about the potential for teaming all of the way up to RZ (but not beyond).  PoP has altered the current framework in use on the Rathe and instead of trying to stretch the rules in existance regarding these mobs, we should either: <br>
<br>
a) Put them on rotation.  If guilds teaming up on every mob before RZ (not saying that CB/VoLS would do that) is viewed as a problem that is greater than the effort of killing them by the guilds currently capable of doing so, put them on rot.  I can guarantee that will end the teaming right there.<br>
<br>
b) Make up a new rule-set for flag-giving mobs.  This is the one where you will be standing on the weakest legal ground.  There is no reason to do this.  Especially if the mobs remain uncontested.  A better comparison than the ones that I keep seeing is Sontalak or LTK.  Nobody on the server would care if VoLS and CB teamed to get more ST keys by killing these guys, especially Sont (who is a remarkable pain in the ass and drops nothing of value save the talisman).  <br>
<br>
c) Admit that these mobs are FCFS in light of their uncontested nature and allow teaming as is the case with VS, Gore, Tal, Fay, Woushi, the little one in CS, all WW dragons save 1 and WToV. <p>Gatori Vonhinx<br>

Absolutely wonderful expose'.  What rotation mob are we attempting to make a rule change on again?  I forgot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is absolutely no logic in asking for a vote by the guilds of the server each time a new rotation is set up. The majority of the guilds would be voting on issues they knew nothing about. If an issue affects two or three guilds only, then why would it be necessary for twenty guilds to vote on it? Seems slightly absurd to me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Because ...maybe ...just maybe ...the other guilds might want to have a say in their future?  Naaa... that's silly.  Why would any other guild want to have a voice in their future when you are doing so well in looking out for us and always making sure that we aren't hampered in any way?  Hey!  I have an idea!  The next time there is an abortion bill introduced, lets only let women who have HAD abortions vote! ...truly, they are the only ones who know what they are talking about.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is absolutely no way to argue that having rotations slows down the progress of up and coming guilds. As has been stated thousands of times before, rotations give guilds who are capable of killing a mob a guaranteed chance to kill that mob every x amount of time. If there were no rotations then sure, some guilds might get to kill one mob more often, but they would also probably lose out on other mobs that they wanted to kill.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->1001 now ...and it still has nothing to do with the discussion of Aerin'Dar, Grummus, and Behemoth who are not currently on rotation.  I would have thought after 1000 times, it would mean something by now ...hmm ...guess not.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
...and I think I have previously made a very clear and logical argument using rotations (of Aerin'Dar, Grummus, and Behemoth) as a means to slow down the progression of up and coming guilds.  I've made the argument several times ...should be hard for you to find. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What you currently see is that when a guild decides a rotation is no longer valuable to them, they move to autopass on it. This means there are more kills available to the guilds still on the rotation, as well as new ones joining it. However, if there were no rotation rules, it is quite likely that many rotation mobs would get killed by small groups of people in big guilds whenever they found them up to equip alts or make cash etc.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->...and we are back to assuming that any questioning of the RTA rules means that you automatically want to go to an FFA server.  *sigh* DING! You have increased your level to 66 of completely ignoring everything being said up to this point!  Gratz!  Wtg!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Many people seem to cry foul of the bigger guilds who are supposedly stifling their chance to grow and access new content. It is not logical to argue that BotS was able to do so well because they got to kill content with no competition for so long, and thus because of rotations, smaller guilds can no longer able to grow as fast because of this. Surely everyone can see that the prize of working hard and getting there first is to have little or no competition on content. It has always been the case in EQ that if you are ahead of the curve you will have more opportunities than those below you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You were on crack when you wrote this, weren't you?  Cmon, admit it.  I cannot determine what left field this came out of ...I'd be happy with narrowing down the state the ballpark is in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This thread has nothing to do with people saying that what CB and VoLS did was against the rules. It wasn't, and that is exactly what this thread is about. Most of those who have killed Aerin`Dar by themselves are not happy with the situation of guilds teaming up on non rotation mobs then killing their rotation mobs as seperate entities. The idea here is to try and establish a set of rules that is fair for everyone and doesn't create any double standards as currently exist.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Hello, Oxy, meet Moron.  You can't be 'right' and 'wrong' at the same time.  You are either 'right' and people are happy for you ...congrats, champagne all around! ...or you are 'wrong' and people 'scowl at you ready to attack'.  Which is it here?  Straddling the fence like that can have dire consequences for your ability to have opinions later.<br>
<br>
I just got here ...what 'double standards' currently exist again?  I forgot.  Is that the double standard of teaming on a non-rotation mob (which is clearly covered as acceptable under the easily understood and written 'FCFS' convention ...you know, I gotta be pulling something outta my ass in every fun filled post!) ...or is that the double standard of applying rotation mob rules to non-rotation mobs by 'extrapolation'?<br>

You can make all your plans based on that information.  You can then watch it all fall apart because the reality of actually getting in there and DEALING with the mobs and events is a hell of a lot different than reading strategies from SafeHouse. <p><table align="left">
