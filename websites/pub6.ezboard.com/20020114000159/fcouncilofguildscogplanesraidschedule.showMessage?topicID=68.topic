Well this was another tragic raid, starting off with 6 hours of Corpse Recovery.  However, this time, I pulled most of the zone afterwards, for I didn't want people to have like 8 deaths and nothing to show for it.  The drops was phenominal, I've seen less drops with the entire zone pulled, we pulled about 3 quarters of it.  Two monk pieces also dropped, that was mentioned above.<br>
<br>
However, I do have to post, not to scold the people but to use this as a resource to instruct you so our future raids can be successful.  We all made a few mistakes, including myself for deciding West Camp was best because only like 4 people knew where the North Camp was.  But our major problem that I want to address, was people not following instructions.  90% of tragedies was the result of people not doing as they was told.  They were honest mistakes, so I'm not mad, but even an honest mistake can wipe us out.  <br>
Examples, people zoning in when someone shouted go, after I said Elisan will tell you when to go in.  It was an honest mistake, but you still need to pay attention, and only follow orders given by my battle commander, or whom I direct.  Also I noticed people ran to the West camp going RIGHT, instead of LEFT around the portal.  You argo a different set of creatures that way, different wander path, along with the wanderers we already have to deal with.  Again honest mistake, how would someone know that being the first time in there.<br>
<br>
So for future raids, it's imperative you follow instructions given.<br>
<br>
<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br>
<br>
Mis-conduct of individuals/perceived mis-conduct of individuals.  If someone is behaving out of line, you will tell me, or someone I designate to handle such activities.  I am not one to tolerate name calling etc... or least publicly.  If you want to whine and moan against each other in Tells go for it, I don't care.  However, the moment you go into a public debate harassing each other, your disturbing my raid, and everyone elses enjoyment.<br>
<br>
And keep in mind during a failed break in, and 4 failed corpse recovery, everyone tends to be very on edge and touchy, including myself.  However, you just have to have patience, and except the fact that's part of the risks of plane raids.  I had 4 un-raisable deaths myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <br>
<br>
The next thing I want to address, which has always been an unspoken law, however, now I have to address it.  Two things aren't allowed on my raids, and you will be BANNED from all my raids if you do this.  And a third thing can get you BANNED also.<br>
<br>
- NINJA LOOTING:  If your caught Ninja Looting, don't ever expect to go on my raids again, your expelled.  Also, I will drop your name to ever guild leader I know, and friends I have in every guild.  So chances are your going to be soloing the rest of your life on Karana.  It's a harsh penalty, so don't do it.<br>
<br>
- DELIBERATE FAILURE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS:  If you given an order and deliberatly do something else.  I may give you one warning depending on the circumstances, thereafter, you will be BANNED.<br>
<br>
- PUBLIC HARRASSEMENT(or related):<br>
If your engaged in such activities that disrupts the fun of others you will be BANNED.  Now granted I am alot more tolerate on this subject, and just because someone shouts out one thing out of line, doesn't mean your banned.  I use my wisdom to understand your frustrated, lost over three bubbles that can't be raised, etc...  But if your continously spamming people for hours, harassing and individual etc...  eventually I will ask you to leave.  You may not be banned at this point, as you calm down and get your senses back.  But if it continues regularly, at some point you will not be allowed to attend anymore.<br>
<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br>
<br>
Now keep in mind, just because I ban you from my raid, doesn't mean your banned from CoG.  Just my raids that I lead.  CoG isn't really a management body, per say, it's just a collection of guilds that cooperate together for fun.  And if someone else runs a raid and says you can attend, that's fine.  Just don't plan on joining any of mine once you get the boot.  However, if they hear you Ninja Looted, I would imagine none of the raid leaders will let you come along as well.  As for the other stuff, the other raid leaders may say you can attend anyways, and it's completely up to them.<br>
<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br>
<br>
For the most part CoG has been great, but there has been enough incidences, or borderline incidence, that I have to explain the unspoken rule.  And as a great bunch of people I look forward to leading future raids. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzellex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zellex</A> at: 12/29/00 8:08:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utoliantrainwrecker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tolian Trainwrecker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(12/29/00 10:19:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: POF recap</span><hr size=1> OMG !!

As stated by Zellex I was one of the unfortunate raiders that lost upwards of 3 bub of xp, my lvl over the course of 8 deaths.  And as such was one of the more boysterous ppl due to my frustration of the way the raid was going and sheer anger in myself for not doing something about it earlier before my outburst.  It was just another very very bad day.  Zellex I thank you for the erstanding you showed me, and I make the promise that if it happens again I won't raise to that level again.<br>

<br>
And just to add my support to Zellex, I completely agree with everything he said. Ninjalooters will have a bad time if their name is circulated among CoG leaders, because there are a lot of us. <br>
<br>
Harrassing language is not to be tolerated by a raid leader, and I've stated just such a thing before. One or two comments out of frustration is understandable. If you can't let it go or take it to tells after that, you will be banned at any raid I'm running, and I expect any CoG raid leader to follow their best judgement and do the same. <br>
<br>
Zellex, Pippi, and others who run CoG raids do so at great personal expense, often gaining no items, experience, or anything other than the fun of leading such a raid. Without their selfless efforts to run such raids, the CoG wouldn't exist, nor would it be successful. Take a moment to consider that, and be thankful for them, as I am. <br>
