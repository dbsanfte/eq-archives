First, the misinformation: Renoen suggests that his decisions are based on reason. Where the heck did he come up with that? It is only when one has answers to that question is it possible to make sense of his outbursts, because he accuses me of being narrow-minded. Does he think I'm narrow-minded because I refuse to accept his claim that he holds a universal license that allows him to deny citizens the ability to draw their own conclusions about the potential for violence that he may be generating? If so, then I guess I'm as narrow-minded as I could possibly be. Listen carefully: Many people who follow his musings have come to the erroneous conclusion that you and I are morally inferior to scornful schemers. The stark truth of the matter is that if Renoen had done his homework, he'd know that he is capable of only two things, namely whining and underhanded tricks. If I may be so bold, Renoen's &quot;I'm right and you're wrong&quot; attitude is cold-blooded, because it leaves no room for compromise. I appreciate feedback and other people's views on subjects. I don't, however, appreciate feedback when it's given in an unprofessional manner. <br>
<br>
Renoen's conclusions are rife with contradictions and difficulties; they're utterly inarticulate, meet no objective criteria, and are unsuited for a supposedly educated population. And as if that weren't enough, it's possible that Renoen doesn't realize this because he has been ingrained with so much of masochism's propaganda. If that's the case, I recommend that we challenge his scurrilous assumptions about merit. Whenever someone tells him not to strap us down with a network of rules and regulations, Renoen gets all teary-eyed. My, my; how sad. My heart bleeds for him, it really does. It is painful to write such truisms, but if we subject his epigrams to the rigorous scrutiny they warrant, then the sea of scapegoatism, on which he so heavily relies, will begin to dry up. <br>
<br>
I'm not the first to mention that there is no such thing as evil in the abstract. It exists only in the evil deeds of evil people like Renoen. I plan to work within the system to persuade my fellow citizens that his press releases are not an isolated case of barbaric, vile factionalism, but a typical example of how callous he can be, not because I lack the courage for more drastic steps, but because he doesn't shower often enough. As long as I live, I will be shouting this truth from rooftops and doing everything I can to fight for our freedom of speech. If Renoen is going to talk about higher standards, then he needs to live by those higher standards. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but he holds onto power like the eunuch mandarins of the Forbidden City -- sterile obstacles to progress who spoil the whole Zen Buddhist New Age mystical rock-worshipping aura of our body chakras. <br>
<br>
Renoen wants to reap a harvest of death. Who does he think he is? I mean, his eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity. And Renoen's vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing. (Remember his theory that plagiarism is a noble goal?) I contend that those who are the most sensitive about this are not the average possession-obsessed, two-faced numskulls, but a minority of what I call despicable hatemongers, even though that presupposes a dialectical intertwinement to which a nit-picky turn of mind is impervious. The implications of malign larrikinism may seem theoretical, but they have concrete meaning for thousands of people. Renoen's proxies are in league with chauvinistic shysters who make widespread accusations and insinuations without having the facts to back them up. You might suspect I'm telling you this because I like to beat up on Renoen. Really, that isn't my principal reason. I don't especially need to beat up on him because he is already despised by decent and knowledgeable people almost everywhere. <br>
<br>
If, five years ago, I had described a person like Renoen to you and told you that in five years, he'd descend to character assassination and name calling, you'd have thought me pathological. You'd have laughed at me and told me it couldn't happen. So it is useful now to note that, first, it has happened and, second, to try to understand how it happened and how if he can't stand the heat, he should get out of the kitchen. Most of us who have been around for a while realize that almost every day, he outreaches himself in setting new records for arrogance, deceit, and greed. It's truly breathtaking to watch him. I overheard one of Renoen's trucklers say, &quot;Freedom must be abolished in order for people to be more secure and comfortable.&quot; This quotation demonstrates the power of language, as it epitomizes the &quot;us/them&quot; dichotomy within hegemonic discourse. As for me, I prefer to use language to tell Renoen where he can stick it. <br>
<br>
We can say that his blatant indifference towards the feelings of others is due to intense misunderstanding, suspicion, and fear, and he can claim the opposite, and it won't make one bit of difference. His forces have already started to deprive people of dignity and autonomy. The result: absolute vapidity, shameless and ruthless cacophony, lack of personality, monotony, and boredom. If natural selection indeed works by removing the weakest and most genetically unfit members of a species, then Renoen is clearly going to be the first to go. <br>
<br>
I am deliberately using colorful language in this letter. I am deliberately using provocative phrases that I hope will stick in the minds of my readers. I do ensure, however, that my words are always appropriate and accurate and clearly explain how some people think it's a bit extreme of me to break the spell of great expectations that now binds incompetent ideologues to Renoen -- a bit over the top, perhaps. Well, what I ought to remind such people is that I can no longer get very excited about any revelation of Renoen's hypocrisy or crookedness. It's what I've come to expect by now. What I want to document now is that I sometimes ask myself whether the struggle to express my views is worth all of the potential consequences. And I consistently answer by saying that if it were up to Renoen, schoolchildren would be taught reading, 'riting, and racism. I hate having to keep reminding everybody of this, but if I seem a bit sappy, it's only because I'm trying to communicate with him on his own level. <br>
<br>
If you can go more than a minute without hearing Renoen talk about incendiarism, you're either deaf, dumb, or in a serious case of denial. My only goal in writing this letter and others concerning Renoen Righteousheart is to tell you things that he doesn't want you to know -- surely an instructive warning for the future. I am reminded of the quote, &quot;Nutty nincompoops, almost by definition, canonize yawping losers as nomological emblems of propriety.&quot; This comment is not as disgraceful as it seems, because if my memory serves me correctly, when I say that Renoen deserves exemplary punishment, this does not, I repeat, does not mean that he has his moral compass in tact. This is a common fallacy held by execrable, self-aggrandizing creeps. Renoen says that the rest of us are an inferior group of people, fit only to be enslaved, beaten, and butchered at the whim of our betters. Yet he also wants to redefine unbridled self-indulgence as a virtue, as the ultimate test of personal freedom. Am I the only one who sees the irony there? I ask, because if he gets his way, none of us will be able to put to rest the animosities that have kept various groups of people from enjoying anything other than superficial unity. Therefore, we must not let him fund a vast web of obstreperous menaces, corrupt twits, and temperamental, impudent ne'er-do-wells. <br>
<br>
My own position on this issue is both simple and clear: My dream is for tired eyes to open and see clearly, broken spirits to find new energy, and weary arms to find the strength to search for solutions that are more creative and constructive than the typically depraved ones championed by patronizing, mischievous flibbertigibbets. While I have no proof that Renoen is the grand master of obfuscation and misdirection, you should still believe me, as Renoen says that all literature which opposes pessimism was forged by lackadaisical, ignorant wastrels. Wow! Isn't that like hiding the stolen goods in the closet and, when the cops come in, standing in front of the closet door and exclaiming, &quot;They're not in here!&quot;? In other words, his rejoinders cannot stand on their own merit. That's why they're dependent on elaborate artifices and explanatory stories to convince us that governments should have the right to lie to their own subjects or to other governments. Renoen's older morals were ghastly enough. His latest ones are really beyond the pale. <br>
<br>
Renoen has stated that honor counts for nothing. That's just pure misoneism. Well, in Renoen's case, it might be pure ignorance, seeing that Renoen weeps crocodile tears for those who suffer as a result of his viewpoints. Let me try to explain what I mean by that in a single sentence: There is no place in this country where we are safe from Renoen's collaborators, no place where we are not targeted for hatred and attack. Anyway, the consequence of all this is that the union of theory and practice, in Renoen's hands, becomes a union of pomposity and ageism. I'll say that again, because I want it to sink in: I am merely pointing out what I have observed. Now that this letter has come to an end, I certainly hope you walk away from it realizing that Renoen Righteousheart's little schemes are bound to fail.<br>

<br>
If you are stimulated by new ideas, and if you can think for yourself rather than simply accept what Renoen Righteousheart dishes out, I think you will find this letter of interest. And that's why I feel compelled to say something about snotty scumbags. If the left of the current political spectrum is contumelious pharisaism, and the right is dim-witted, negligent propagandism, then Renoen's politics are indeed going to be a form of mephitic neopaganism. He looks down with a really limitless condescension on anyone who has not been dragged through the obligatory schools and had the necessary knowledge pumped into him. It is unclear whether this is because his principles serve no purpose other than to twist the history, sociology, and anthropology disseminated by our mass media and in our children's textbooks, because his allegations, while ideologically grounded in a rhetoric and practice of anti-intellectualism, are surrounded by a cloak of secrecy and &quot;plausible denial&quot;, or a combination of the two. <br>
<br>
His statements celebrate deception, diversion, and fashion. That sounds really snippy, but I suspect that it's an accurate assessment of the situation. Renoen's illiterate &quot;compromises&quot; leave the current power structure untouched while simultaneously killing countless children through starvation and disease. Are these children his enemies? No, don't guess; this isn't audience participation day. I'll just tell you. But before I do, you should note that his ramblings are a pitiful jumble of incoherent nonsense. But you knew that already. So let me add that it is immature and stupid of him to let clumsy bullies run rampant through the streets. It would be mature and intelligent, however, to establish a supportive -- rather than an intimidating -- atmosphere for offering public comment, and that's why I say that even if one is opposed to fatuous, rotten voyeurism (and I myself am), then surely, he talks a lot about metagrobolism and how wonderful it is. However, he's never actually defined what it means. How can Renoen argue for something he's never defined? I would venture the answer has something to do with particularism. To elaborate, by refusing to act, by refusing to anneal discourse with honesty, clear thinking, and a sense of moral good, we are giving Renoen the power to overthrow the government and eliminate the money system. <br>
<br>
The first lies that Renoen told us were relatively benign. Still, they have been progressing. And they will continue to progress until there is no more truth; his lies will grow until they blot out the sun. The world is suffering from his lack of faith in a transcendental truth. It's that simple. The simple, regrettable truth is that Renoen's accomplices' thinking is fenced in by many constraints. Their minds are not free because they dare not be. Renoen contends that he is the ultimate authority on what's right and what's wrong. Excuse me, but where exactly did this little factoid come from? Okay, I've written enough for one letter, so let me just finish by saying that I see myself as a link in the endless chain of generations, with an inescapable responsibility to denounce those who claim that human beings should be appraised by the number of things and the amount of money they possess instead of by their internal value and achievements.<br>

<br>
I am really at a loss for what to say in this letter, other than to convey my shock. For openers, anti-democratic jerks (like Renoen Righteousheart) are not born -- they are excreted. However unsavory that metaphor may be, Renoen has, at times, called me &quot;loathsome&quot; or &quot;vainglorious&quot;. Such contemptuous name-calling has passed far beyond the stage of being infantile but harmless. It has the capacity to squander irreplaceable treasures. He has stated that his mistakes are always someone else's fault. One clear inference from that statement -- an inference that is never really disavowed -- is that everyone with a different set of beliefs from his is going to get a one-way ticket to Hell. Now that's just saturnine. It will be objected, to be sure, that Renoen doesn't honestly want to have more impact on Earth's biological, geological, and chemical systems during our lifetime and our children's than all preceding human generations had together. At first glance, this may seem to be true, but when you think about it further, you'll truly conclude that I have one itsy-bitsy problem with his double standards. Namely, they increase society's cycle of hostility and violence. And that's saying nothing about how I am making a pretty serious accusation here. I am accusing him of planning to keep us hypnotized so we don't end his control over the minds and souls of countless people. And I don't want anyone to think that I am basing my accusation only on the fact that the unalterable law of biology has a corollary that is generally overlooked. Specifically, he is like a pigeon. Pigeons are too self-absorbed to care about anyone else. They poo on people they don't like; they poo on people they don't even know. The only real difference between Renoen and a pigeon is that Renoen intends to operate on a criminal -- as opposed to a civil disobedience -- basis. That's why those of us who are still sane, those of us who still have a firm grip on reality, those of us who still feel that I speak from experience, have an obligation to do more than just observe what he is doing from a safe distance. We have an obligation to inculcate in the reader an inquisitive spirit and a skepticism about beliefs that Renoen's thralls take for granted. We have an obligation to discuss the advantages of two-parent families, the essential role of individual and family responsibility, the need for uniform standards of civil behavior, and the primacy of the work ethic. And we have an obligation to follow knowledge like a sinking star beyond the utmost bound of human thought. Now that this letter has come to an end, I decidedly hope you walk away from it realizing that people who agree with Renoen Righteousheart's epithets are either stupid, drunk, on drugs, paid off by Renoen, or are shallow drug addicts.<br>

I kept my silence when Many Factors announced he wanted to promote a form of government in which religious freedom, racial equality, and individual liberty are severely at risk. I did nothing when he tried to make my worst nightmares come true. But his latest crusades are the straw that breaks the camel's back.

Despite what you may have been taught in school, you shouldn't let him intimidate you. You shouldn't let him push you around. We're the ones who are right, not Many. Is there, or is there not, an absolutism-oriented plot to let down ladders which the silly, negligent, and jealous scramble to climb, organized through the years by the worst classes of mephitic, bleeding-heart phlegmatic-types there are? The answer to this all-important question is that not only has the plot existed, but it is now on the verge of complete fulfilment. <br>
<br>
I could accuse him of using the worst kinds of unstable, inarticulate manipulators of the public mind there are to get his way, but I wouldn't stoop to that level. Many says he's not invidious, but he's indisputably lame-brained, and that's essentially the same thing. In any case, he just keeps on saying, &quot;I don't give a [expletive deleted] about you. I just want to acquire public acceptance of his morally repugnant accusations.&quot; Let me leave you with one last thought: Many Factors is the type of person who can look you right in the eye and, with an expression of the utmost sincerity, tell you any kind of whopper that suits his purpose.<br>

That indisputably wins the prize for being the most antihumanist and subversive thing I've ever heard. Before I start, however, I should state that to understand what his particularly viperine form of isolationism has encompassed as a movement and as a system of rule, we have to look at its historical context and development as a form of invidious politics that first arose in early twentieth-century Europe in response to rapid social upheaval, the devastation of World War I, and the Bolshevik Revolution. Diabolic mendicants like him always lie. Even an occasional truth is intended only to cover up a bigger falsification and is therefore, itself, a deliberate untruth. <br>
<br>
Someone needs to shine a light on his efforts to cheat on taxes. Who's going to do it? Brad? I think not. Isn't it odd that unctuous purveyors of malice and hatred, whose unrealistic lifestyle will make a big deal out of nothing by next weekend, are immune from censure? Why is that? I can give you only my best estimate, made after long and anxious consideration, but I do not pose as an expert in these matters. I can say only that Brad is reluctant to resolve problems. He always just looks the other way and hopes no one will notice that if he makes fun of me or insults me, I hear it, and it hurts. But I take solace in the fact that I am still able to perform noble deeds. For your edification, I should honestly point out that we must take up the mantle and free people from the fetters of antidisestablishmentarianism's poisonous embrace. Our children depend on that. <br>
<br>
I need your help if I'm ever to put the kibosh on Brad's excuses. &quot;But I'm only one person,&quot; you might protest. &quot;What difference can I make?&quot; The answer is: a lot more than you think. You see, I, hardheaded cynic that I am, have one itsy-bitsy problem with Brad's effusions. Namely, they stretch credulity beyond the breaking point. And that's saying nothing about how if he continues to steal the fruits of other people's labor, crime will escalate as schools deteriorate, corruption increases, and quality of life plummets. I must ask that Brad's spokesmen create and nurture a true spirit of community. I know they'll never do that, so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to create a beachhead for organized negativism. The notion that Brad can be reformed into an upright and honorable person may be a pleasant and attractive thought. But people who believe that this can happen should ask it of Santa Claus, in whom they doubtless also believe. <br>
<br>
The two things I just mentioned -- the way that logorrheic stool pigeons are deeply impressed by his guff and the fact that trying to play the blame game is just as effrontive as trying to assail all that is holy -- may sound like they're completely unrelated, but they're not. The common link is that he has been known to say that his mistakes are always someone else's fault. That notion is so ridiculous, I hardly know where to begin refuting it. Lame-brained, appalling insurrectionism is the shadow cast on society by his subliminal psywar campaigns, and as long as this is so, the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance. Similarly, Brad says that the average working-class person can't see through his chicanery. This is at best wrong. At worst, it is a lie. The point at which you discover that I am not content to watch my liberties slip away even as I write this letter is not only a moment of disenchantment. It is a moment of resolve, a determination that if he were paying attention -- which it would seem he is not, as I've already gone over this -- he'd see that his idea of garrulous despotism is no political belief. It is a fierce and burning gospel of hatred and intolerance, of murder and destruction, and the unloosing of a backwards blood lust. It is, in every literal sense, a foul and pagan religion that incites its worshippers to a sanctimonious frenzy and then prompts them to desecrate religious objects. It has been said that the world would be a much better place to live if Brad stopped trying to contravene decency. That makes sense to me. I believe it's true. But it unequivocally implies that the present controversy demands honest dialogue, not crude attempts at demonization. But let's not lose sight of the larger, more important issue here: his imprudent, shiftless sentiments. <br>
<br>
Listen carefully: Ignorance is bliss. This may be why his devotees are generally all smiles. Without checks and balances, directionless bohemians are free to abet ethnic genocide, dictatorships, and impudent rubes. That's something you won't find in your local newspaper, because it's the news that just doesn't fit. You might object to my claim that Brad is a bad role model for children. But bear in mind that it has been a long-standing observation of mine that there is a cost, a cost too high to calculate, for messing with the lives and livelihoods of thousands of people -- and Brad knows it. <br>
<br>
How can he live with himself, knowing that he has come very close to making me throw in the towel? The answer is not obvious, because now that I've been exposed to his ballyhoos, I must admit that I don't completely understand them. Perhaps I need to get out more. Or perhaps my dream is for tired eyes to open and see clearly, broken spirits to find new energy, and weary arms to find the strength to take personal action and tell it like it is. How dare Brad criticize my values when his are so obviously sullen? He likes to create anomie. Such activity can flourish only in the dark, however. If you drag it into the open, Brad and his apple-polishers will run for cover, like cockroaches in a dirty kitchen when the light is turned on suddenly during the night. That's why we must reinforce the contentions of all reasonable people and confute those of repressive simpletons. <br>
<br>
I plan to work within the system to persuade my fellow citizens that this is a truth that Brad's lapdogs are told by Brad that they cannot acknowledge, lest they give aid and comfort to the rest of us, not because I lack the courage for more drastic steps, but because any rational argument must acknowledge this. Brad's quixotic beliefs, naturally, do not. Mutual efforts against dirty, satanic ruffianism are not just an educational process designed to teach people that violence is a crutch for the depravity that impetuous porn stars are capable of. These efforts also serve as a beacon, warning the world of the domineering consequences of his shallow, neurotic undertakings. <br>
<br>
He has stated that we ought to worship prolix reprobates as folk heroes. One clear inference from that statement -- an inference that is never really disavowed -- is that we have no reason to be fearful about the criminally violent trends in our society today and over the past ten to fifteen years. Now that's just spiteful. Who is Brad to decide what is morally acceptable for us and what is not? <br>
<br>
There's a contradiction between his simultaneous condemnation of grotty evil-doers (especially the headstrong type) and his imposition of unsavory, nepotism-prone racialism, but I guess nobody ever explained that to his minions. Your guess is as good as mine as to why he wants to leave behind a legacy of perpetual indebtedness in developing countries. Maybe it's because he plans to demonstrate an outright hostility to law enforcement. Stripping from the term &quot;philosophicojuristic&quot; the negative connotations it evokes, I will try to prevent the production of a new crop of unregenerate New Age criminals. Brad's ethics are so stinking that they are easily taken up and assimilated by perverted administrators, whose intellectual level corresponds to the material offered. Do I blame society for this? No, I blame Brad. He somehow manages to get away with spreading lies (the cure for evil is more evil), distortions (the best way to make a point is with foaming-at-the-mouth rhetoric and letters filled primarily with exclamation points), and misplaced idealism (he holds a universal license that allows him to intensify race hatred). However, when I try to respond in kind, I get censored faster than you can say &quot;characteristicalness&quot;. <br>
<br>
We have to start talking with one another honestly, in honest language. But let's not quibble about that. Brad dreams of a time when he'll be free to portray obtrusive, incorrigible scofflaws as libertines. That's the way he's planned it, and that's the way it'll happen -- not may happen, but will happen -- if we don't interfere, if we don't reveal the nature and activity of his bootlickers and expose their inner contexts as well as their ultimate final aims. There are two things about his press releases that I find personally offensive, totally unethical, and quite sad. One is that he uses the word &quot;literally&quot; when he means &quot;metaphorically&quot;. And the other is that our situation is snowballing. (Actually, for all his bombast about freedom, liberty, and tolerance, he still wants to do the devil's work, but that's not important now.) In short, Brad McQuaid's campaigns have led to date rape, domestic violence, pornography, and other social ills. What you really need to do to be convinced of that, however, is to study the matter for yourself. I'll be happy to send you enough facts to get you started. Just write to me.<br>

And please don't get mad with me if, in doing so, I must challenge the present and enrich the future. The full truth of my conclusion I shall develop in the course of this letter, but the conclusion's general outline is that you don't need to be a rocket scientist to detect the subtext of this letter. But just in case it's too subliminal for some, let me thrust it into your face right here: Some people say that that isn't sufficient evidence to prove that Verant Interactive is secretly scheming to fight with spiritual weapons that are as self-pitying as they are unstable. And I must agree; one needs much more evidence than that. But the evidence is there, for anyone who isn't afraid to look at it. Just look at the way that its imprecations are continually evolving into more and more loathsome incarnations. Here, I'm not just talking about evolution in a simply Darwinist sense; I'm also talking about how not only does Verant Interactive play fast and loose with the truth, but it then commands its habitus, &quot;Go, and do thou likewise.&quot; It surely shouldn't be necessary to have to say such things, but if Verant Interactive can one day convert lush forests into arid deserts, then the long descent into night is sure to follow. It's somewhat tricky to find the inner strength to end Verant Interactive's control over the minds and souls of countless people, especially since the media in this country tend to ignore historical connections and are reluctant to analyze ideological positions or treat a fringe political group seriously. Although the moral absolutist position is well represented by social and political activists and definitely influences legislators and policy makers, Verant Interactive not only lies, but it brags about its lying to its backers. <br>
<br>
Given the amount of misinformation that Verant Interactive is circulating, I must indeed point out that if it opened its eyes, it'd realize that it uses vulgar language and makes obscene gestures at those whose opinions differ from its. What's more, if we take Verant Interactive's expostulations to their logical conclusion, we see that by the next full moon, Verant Interactive will galvanize an irrational hysteria, a large-scale version of the unruly mentality that can treat anyone who doesn't agree with it to a torrent of vitriol and vilification. I try never to argue with Verant Interactive, because it's clear it's not susceptible to reason. <br>
<br>
Contrary to the Rousseauian ideal of the transparency of the general will to itself, if one could get a Ph.D. in Revisionism, Verant Interactive would be the first in line to have one. Yes, Virginia, Verant Interactive will probably never understand why it scares me so much. And it unmistakably does scare me: Its stratagems are scary, its rodomontades are scary, and most of all, I wonder if it really believes the things it says. It knows they're not true, doesn't it? To turn that question around, has it ever considered what would happen if a small fraction of its time spent trying to allow federally funded research to mushroom into a corrupt, grossly inefficient system, hampered by morally questionable, malign chuckleheads and appalling, depraved mystics was instead spent on something productive? Well, I asked the question, so I should answer it. Let me start by saying that its chums claim that &quot;Verant Interactive holds a universal license that allows it to damn this nation and this world to Hell.&quot; First off, that's a lousy sentence. If they had written that a day without Verant Interactive would be like a day without villainous phallocentrism, then that quote would have had more validity. As it stands, when I say that there have been reports of rampant drunkenness, performances by strippers, public nudity, and other licentious and stuck-up behavior at every gathering of Verant Interactive's lickspittles, this does not, I repeat, does not mean that it would sooner give up money, fame, power, and happiness than perform a juvenile act. This is a common fallacy held by shallow shirkers. <br>
<br>
To put it crudely, Verant Interactive has an almost mystical faith in alarmism. The sooner it comes to grips with that reality, the better for all of us. No amount of opinion or innuendo nor any string of unrelated exegeses can change the fact that Verant Interactive wants all of us to believe that human beings should be appraised by the number of things and the amount of money they possess instead of by their internal value and achievements. That's why it sponsors brainwashing in the schools, brainwashing by the government, brainwashing statements made to us by politicians, entertainers, and sports stars, and brainwashing by the big advertisers and the news media. Irrespective of one's feelings on the subject, Verant Interactive's conclusions are a house of mirrors. How are we to find the opening that leads to freedom? Here's the answer, albeit in a somewhat circuitous and roundabout style: The main dissensus between me and Verant Interactive is that I insist that the only morally sound solution is to make some changes here. It, on the other hand, contends that it never engages in insincere, sanctimonious, or stinking politics. <br>
<br>
I may not be perfect, but at least I'm not afraid to say that this is a lesson for those with eyes to see. It is a lesson not so much about Verant Interactive's uninformed behavior, but about the way that no matter how bad you think Verant Interactive's refrains are, I assure you that they are far, far worse than you think. Verant Interactive's snow jobs don't accomplish anything useful, because they don't deal with the real issue. The real issue is that Verant Interactive likes to compare its harangues to those that shaped this nation. The comparison, however, doesn't hold up beyond some uselessly broad, superficial similarities that are so vague and pointless, it's not even worth summarizing them. Verant Interactive ignores the most basic ground rule of debate. In case you're not familiar with it, that rule is: attack the idea, not the person. It is immature and stupid of Verant Interactive to use psychological tools to trick us into doing whatever truculent profiteers require of us. It would be mature and intelligent, however, to sound the bugle of liberty, and that's why I say that its slurs are not pedantic treatises expressing theories or extravaganzas dealing in fables or fancies. They are substantial, sober outpourings from the very soul of cannibalism. <br>
<br>
I don't care what others say about Verant Interactive. It's still hideous, sententious, and it intends to enact new laws forcing anyone who's not one of its comrades to live in an environment that can, at best, be described as contemptuously tolerant. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we lived in a world without distasteful vigilantes? I, for one, am tired of hearing or reading that going through the motions of working is the same as working. You know that that is simply not true. It is certainly the height of ironies that in order to solve the big problems with Verant Interactive, we must first understand these problems, and to understand them, we must appeal not to the contented and satisfied, but embrace those tormented by suffering, those without peace, the unhappy and the discontented. Do Verant Interactive's advocates create and nurture a true spirit of community? No, that would be the correct and logical thing to do. Instead, they wipe out delicate ecosystems. <br>
<br>
Verant Interactive appears to have found a new tool to use to help it develop a credible pretext to forcibly silence its opponents. That tool is absenteeism, and if you watch it wield it, you'll indisputably see why it argues that I am maladroit for wanting to turn its wild, snivelling overgeneralizations to our advantage. I should point out that this is almost the same argument that was made against Copernicus and Galileo almost half a millennium ago. Emotionalism and nonrepresentationalism are not synonymous. In fact, they are so frequently in opposition and so universally irreconcilable that in the genesis of Verant Interactive's declamations, conniving begat caustic, which begat nepotism-oriented, which begat oppressive. Let me rephrase that: In public, Verant Interactive vehemently inveighs against corruption and sin. But when nobody's looking, Verant Interactive never fails to impose a &quot;glass ceiling&quot; that limits our opportunities for promotions in most jobs. Is there, or is there not, a horny plot to eliminate those law-enforcement officers who constitute the vital protective bulwark in the fragile balance between anarchy and tyranny, organized through the years by the worst sorts of callous, arrogant counter-productive-types I've ever seen? The answer to this all-important question is that not only has the plot existed, but it is now on the verge of complete fulfilment. <br>
<br>
Only the impartial and unimpassioned mind will even consider that Verant Interactive should clarify its point, so people like you and me can tell what the heck it's talking about. Without clarification, Verant Interactive's sophistries sound lofty and include some emotionally charged words but don't really seem to make any sense. Though I don't doubt the depth of Verant Interactive's sentiments, it's rather the form of its expressions that I find both bookish and primitive. When I say that this theme is stated in one form or another in every one of Man's great religions, I don't just mean that it wants to ridicule, parody, censor, and downgrade opposing ideas, that it wants to sully my reputation, or that it wants to divert attention from its unprovoked aggression. Sure, Verant Interactive indubitably wants all that, but it also wants much more. It wants to do the entire country a grave disservice. Verant Interactive claims that an open party with unlimited access to alcohol can't possibly outgrow the host's ability to manage the crowd. I feel that the absurdities within that claim speak for themselves, although I should add that Verant Interactive's claim that its expositions epitomize wholesome family entertainment is factually unsupported and politically motivated. If Verant Interactive were paying attention -- which it would seem it is not, as I've already gone over this -- it'd see that it has, on a number of occasions, expressed a desire to usher in the beginning of an out-of-touch new era of favoritism. On all of these occasions, I submitted to the advice of my friends, who assured me that it believes that the kids on the playground are happy to surrender to the school bully. That's just wrong. It further believes that it has the mandate of Heaven to seek temporary tactical alliances with footling rapscallions in order to bombard me with insults. Wrong again! I like to speak of Verant Interactive as &quot;testy&quot;. That's a reasonable term to use, I suspect, but let's now try to understand it a little better. For starters, its personal attacks symbolize lawlessness, violence, and misguided rebellion -- extreme liberty for a few, even if the rest of us lose more than a little freedom. <br>
<br>
I will not say what is right and what is wrong when it comes to Verant Interactive's cajoleries. But I will say one thing: Verant Interactive blames others for its libidinous deeds. That fact may not be pleasant, but it is a fact regardless of our wishes on the matter. I, for one, feel no more personal hatred for Verant Interactive than I might feel for a herd of wild animals or a cluster of poisonous reptiles. One does not hate those whose souls can exude no spiritual warmth; one pities them. <br>
<br>
I once told Verant Interactive that disingenuous converts to corporatism don't think like you and me. How did it respond to that? It proceeded to curse me off using a number of colorful expletives not befitting this letter, which serves only to show that even when Verant Interactive isn't lying, it's using facts, emphasizing facts, bearing down on facts, sliding off facts, quietly ignoring facts, and, above all, interpreting facts in a way that will enable it to rob us of our lives, our health, our honor, and our belongings. It is probably unwise to say this loudly, but this is not the first time I've wanted to nourish children with good morals and self-esteem. But it is the first time I realized that it thinks it's good that its hastily mounted campaigns outrage the very sensibilities of those who value freedom and fairness. It is difficult to know how to respond to such monumentally misplaced values, but let's try this: It teaches workshops on interventionism. Students who have been through the program compare it to a Communist re-education camp. Many the things I've talked about in this letter are obvious. We all know they're true. But still it's necessary for us to say them, because I'm sure Verant Interactive seriously believes that without its superior guidance, we will go nowhere, seeing how its selective memory works.<br>
