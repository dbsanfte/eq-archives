<br>
After the Incident, it was learned that Trompen wasn't completely ready for Ragefire, as he would have been in his Original Form.  ie: Trompen didn't have the King's Note, nor the Pearl from Sol B.  <br>
<br>
I know that out-of-sequence camping is doable with the New Ragefire, but I thought that the &quot;Gentlemen's Agreement&quot; had taken this into consideration, and the Honor System was in place? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uroggulbuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 476<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/24/02 4:05:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=158.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ragefire Agreement question</span><hr size=1> Tough call. <br>
<br>
Personally, I think a cleric camping ragefire before they have all the other pieces is a bit greedy: In that week or two that you are holding the camp, another cleric could have actually *gotten* their epic. <br>
<br>
The Ragefire is a bottleneck for so many clerics who *are* ready for the piece, to compound the problem with clerics camping it before they are ready? Doens't seem like good sense to me. <br>
<br>
Hell, hardest part right? Why not get it out of the way first, right? Yeah, and while you've got Begurgle's crown sitting in the bank next to the unpure heart of ragefire, and you're off on your rogue alt... <br>
<br>
Extreme example, but personally, I'd like to see clerics agree to leave RF alone until they actually can turn in that one part and get the epic. <br>
<br>
So, as an official standpoint, Clan Bashemded will not attempt to camp ragefire for a cleric that does not have the remainder of the quest finished in full. <br>
<br>
I would think it's not much to ask, seeing as how the camp is so ungodly anyway, that others do the same. But that's me. <br>
<br>
Whenever I play a cleric to 50+, I'll come back and be a little more direct about my ideas of the camp. *wink*<br>

Thank god i saw this bottle neck before it turned into this @#%$.<br>

<br>
It will be made longer if clerics who are not on their last step camp it. <br>
<br>
If it doesn't matter what step the cleric is on, the cleric could start their epic with the Ragefire camp, by that logic. <br>
<br>
Would you say that a level 49 cleric camping it is &quot;get[ting] it over with while they can.&quot;? If you think that a level 49 cleric should be camping ragefire, what about a level 48? 47? when does the number become too low? 46? 36? <br>
<br>
Yes, the game mechanics have changed in that you can now get the ragefire piece out of the old order. What *I* am saying, though, is that we should maintain the old mechanics through our actions: that is, just because you are now *able* to camp ragefire without the king note, doesn't mean that you *should*.<br>
<br>
If all that matters is when it is convienient for the cleric, then they could start the camp whenever they wanted. That's fine, if there was only one cleric on the server that needed the epic. <br>
<br>
However, being that there is more than just one cleric that needs their epic, the best way to try to reduce the length of the line to camp it, is to make sure that people only camp it when they are ready for it. It just stands to reason that the number of clerics that want their epic is greater than the number of clerics who are on the last step of their epic. <br>
<br>
The list, by the way, was a really bad idea that started off with the best intentions. The six month long waiting list was a *much* bigger bottleneck than our 4 week line up. <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, if the situation is not as obvious to you as it is to me, I'm sure it will get itself figured out fairly fast. <br>

Wasting 4 weeks of yours and guildmates is worse then waiting for your name on the list to come up.  The way it works now, people have to wait until their time is up and then wait for Ragefire to spawn for themselves.  The only real reason why the list was removed was because the people further down the list were whining and crying.  Now  they created  something worse for themselves because their foresight is that of a chicken whose head is going to get cut off.  Soooooo now everyone who supported the removal is bitching about what they caused for themselves.  It is the never ending bitch fest that goes on this board.<br>
<br>
HAGG and have fun all clerics and guilds who have to waste their online time and fun because of it.  <br>

<br>
BTW, If the guild can kill ragefire, they surely can do chardok.  So therefore if they were smart, they'd get in line before there is a list of clerics waiting for months.  Stupidity created this problem....GG VI and Rathe whiners.<br>

Ragefire is a heck of alot easier than the Chardok Royals.  Ragefire is one fight.. vs essentially nagafen.   The Royals requires a decent raid grp that can listen and follow directions all the way down, pull the king etc.<br>
<br>
And the list *was* a bad idea, imo. Rotations work because it's not a large amount of participants, lists for individuals do not work.. there shouldn't be a reservation system for a single spawn.<br>
<br>
That said, it's my opinion that if you're 50+ and you wanna camp Ragefire, more power to ya.  The less rules and the more simple the agreement, the better off we will be. <p>Nicolai IronCross<br>

<br>
No offense to the smaller guilds out there, KIC is a casual gamer guild but we have a ton of experiance (as one of the oldest guilds on the server) and we have the people to do the Royals in Chardok.<br>
<br>
Half the Clerics on the &quot;List&quot; were a long way from being able to do the royals thus making those that had already done the royals and only needed Ragefire to complete their epic wait that much longer.<br>
<br>
Verant screwed the pooch bigtime on this whole Ragefire thing, they essentialy made the last stage of the cleric epic to easy with no prior dependancy on the rest of the quest - simply put the wrong thing to do.<br>
<br>
The massive rush for the Ragefire camp was caused because alot of folks that couldn't do the royals saw another step they could do in thier epic, meaning instead of removing a bottleneck to the Cleric quest they essentialy created a new bottleneck while the quest itself is just as difficult (Do to the King camp) as it always had been.<br>
<br>

Mind you, we had no idea this was for Trompen as I assumed that he already HAD this peice because he camped Ragefire. <br>
Anyway we agreed that they could get first note, as they ONLY needed 1 note, and we would get next and stay to camp it also for the Queen.<br>
When we killed the King, to my surprise: Grats Trompen! was called. Ofcourse I was happy for him and that we had helped this person after the *incident* but it still popped a question in my head. How could he camp RF when he did not have all the other parts? But seems like you can with the new RF spawn.<br>
However I will not encourage our clerics to camp RF when it is not the last piece they need.<br>

<br>
RF takes alot of real life time over an extended period, which most people have to plan.  They have to plan time off of work, maybe work it around holidays.  Make sure other RL commitments are taken care, etc.<br>
<br>
While Overking is a 2 hour spawn that can be killed anytime.<br>
<br>
Do I want to see the RF part rotting in someones bank?  No.  But most people can get all the other part for the cleric epic within a week of killing RF.<br>
<br>
Question for the guilds on the Sev rotation.  Do all your warriors have all the rest of the quest done and just need a green scale?<br>
<br>
Do all paladins and bards that kill Gorenaire/Vox have all the little items for thier epic complete first?  Or do you wait until you get the hard item done first, then get the 1-2 group items?<br>

<br>
If Cleric B, who is not ready for RF, gets the piece before Cleric A, who is, what good does it do anyone?<br>
<br>
Not only is it up to the individual Cleric to say &quot;no, I'm not ready yet&quot;, but also the Guild he belongs to.<br>
<br>
As has been asked, when does the cleric &quot;get RF out of the way&quot;?  When he first thinks about getting his Epic?  When he's half-way done?  When he has 3 or 4 weeks to sit in SF?<br>
<br>
If Clerics were willing to wait to camp RF until that was the only piece they needed, as they had to do with the &quot;old RF&quot;, there would be a lot less clerics sitting on their collective a$$es in Skyfire, and more click-sticks coming into the world on RF's death. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unizer2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nizer2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EotF</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/1/02 12:37:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=158.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ragefire Agreement question</span><hr size=1> while i agree with you nyca, the reality is there is no real way to prove/disprove if a cleric camping RF has/not completed all of the other parts of their epic. <p>-nizer

Like Milambus said, the king piece isn't all that hard to get but the ragefire piece is just due to the time involved.  I do find camping ragefire as one of your first pieces to the epic a bit excessive, I dont really see anything wrong with camping him if you only need the note or scepter.  Cause to be honest, if you are serious camping ragefire all this time, you arent gonna let the piece rot in the bank because you are serious about getting the epic and the note or the scepter will soon follow the downing of ragefire.  I think the &quot;gentlemens agreement&quot; should also encompas those clerics who are willing to spend their time on ragefire as one of their last 2 pieces.  I think this would prevent whole lot of arguments over the issue.  Just a few thoughts from me. <p>-Dinekus Aleswigger

<br>
Would I personally have camped Ragefire before getting the note? No. I will also counsel all the clerics in Far Seekers to wait until they have completed all steps prior to Ragefire before camping him. However, I believe that the order a cleric does their epic in is not up to The Rathe Community to regulate.  <p><center>

The old Ragefire camp had one cleric waiting on rage, with other clerics hoping to have next shot at him, but not actively sitting on their butts in SolB holding a spot on a 'camp list order'.<br>
<br>
Once Ragefire died for the cleric that was camping him, it was basically a FFA for the next cleric to run in and take over the camp. This whole idea of lists and the fact that a cleric sitting over on one side of the zone afk is automatically gets ragefire just because he has his computer turned on is the dumbest @#%$ I have ever seen.<br>
<br>
I think that the cleric that is online and camping him should be respected, but I do not think we should support the other 6 clerics that choose to sit there for 4 weeks on end. No reasonable person can say this is an exceptable amount of time to remain in a camp. Once Ragefire spawns you should run to skyfire and call the next camp while the original cleric kills RF with their guild.<br>
<br>
All of this waiting for 4 weeks or whatever is a load of bullshit. Basically there should be some way to claim the camp other than just sitting on your ass. This is a problem that was created by Verant taking him out of solB. At least then you had to have enough people to clear the FG's and keep them down every 8 hours or so. In skyfire the camp is just being in the zone, alone, and afk... Does not sound like a camp to me.<br>
<br>
In its current version, this agreement is a joke at best. Something needs done, even if it is just a FFA called on the ragefire spawn. That is my opinion. Although Tindi will abide by the rules set forth on the server, I can pretty well say the rules on this are total ass. <p><CENTER>

The practice you guys have killing larger mobs in more difficult settings prepares you for that. However, not everyone has that experience, levels, numbers, and equipment. <br>
<br>
I would offer that all guilds capable of killing the King are able to kill ragefire, but that the reverse is not true. Ragefire is a (usually) solo mob, in an outdoor zone. The king is placed in a zone where, upon a total party wipe out past a locked door, you're coffin shopping. <br>
<br>
In any event, the point about where a cleric is in their epic is moot: We cannot verify where a cleric is in the quest, and on top of that, if the cleric is willing to camp ragefire before being &quot;ready&quot; for ragefire, not having every piece is still not an excuse to take it from them. Sure, life would be better if they'd wait on it, but sometimes life is not always that way.<br>
<br>
So, right, we've gotten past that &quot;cleric must be on the last step&quot; hurdle that we've been having. Best case: clerics understand that making the camp harder for everyone also makes it harder for them. Reality: Some people are stupid about things like that, and would rather have a heart in their bank than an epic on another cleric. To each their own, or whatever we have to say to agree to disagree on this point. <br>
<br>
However: Given the resources we have to work with, this camp *cannot* be moved to FFA, or any other variation on a race. Why not?<br>
<br>
Because guilds that can kill the king do not usually, have the resources available to them to race and beat guilds like SoT, BotS, NB, Tindi, etc to a mob in an outdoor zone with port locations for wizards and druids. <br>
<br>
Making Ragefire a FFA mob will create a situation in which cleric epics will go to the largest guilds first, and only when those largest guilds no longer have clerics who need their epics, only then will other clerics begin to have access to the mob. However, lets not forget that the larger guilds, in a FFA situation, do not have anything stopping them from killing ragefire for alts, friends, alts of friends, etc etc. For every member of a large guild that has a cleric alt, there's *another* ragefire that would go to one of the big guilds on the server, before a small guild would see even one. Not a good system. <br>
<br>
Sorry, but if you cannot see why that is unfair, I don't think that you should be allowed to play with other people and/or sharp objects. <br>
<br>
(the 'you' in that statement is not a directed one, it's meant to frame the discussion only, not to point at an individual.)<br>
<br>
A rotation/waiting list is a horribly bad idea. I promise, no matter how much people bring it up, no matter how tired I get of explaining why it is a bad idea, I will always point out why it is a bad idea. <br>
<br>
It creates a situation in which people have to wait for months, not weeks for ragefire. A five month wait, is longer than a 4 to 5 week long wait, especially when the &quot;list&quot; is not enforcable by any means at all. If the cleric is not *in the zone* and *online* than the list becomes totally useless, as opportunists rightfully take advantage of the opportunity. <br>
<br>
If, in the same breath, you say that &quot;If a cleric is willing to camp for 4 or 5 weeks, it doesn't matter what step of their epic they are on&quot;, it is counter productive to then say &quot;but I think a list is better because then the cleric doesn't have to camp for any time, they just wait until their turn on the list is up&quot;. <br>
<br>
First: Their turn on the &quot;list&quot; means what? That they show up after ragefire pops, and then get the spawn? <br>
<br>
Should a guild that is not on the list, be expected to pass up Zordak Ragefire spawned in Skyfire, when they are the only ones in the zone, because the cleric on the list may log on later in the day? That is *not* what would happen. I'm sorry, but even as I understand it with the larger rotation mobs, if you are not able to kill it within a reasonable time, the mob moves to the next group on the rotation. If the group in question does not even have their cleric online, how can they have a legitimate claim? They can't, and Rage becomes a FFA. <br>
<br>
Second: Getting on this list. How many guilds are able to kill ragefire? I would say, given enough warning, as a protected, totally reserved spawn would provide, that at least all the guilds able to go to the planes, per the RTA rules, would be able to kill ragefire. There are 24 planable entities on the links page alone, to say nothing of those who do not have links off that page. <br>
<br>
So, assuming 20 guilds, for both ease of calculation and oversimplifying the number involved to prove my point more convincingly if one realizes the number would be quite higher in practice than in theory...<br>
<br>
Our previous convention was that a guild could have one cleric on the list at a time. That would make a 20 week waiting period for a guild to get put on the list for a second sprinkler. It would also mean that the last person on this 'list' would have a 20 week waiting period to get the first sprinkler. <br>
<br>
Five months. Five months, with a good chance of losing the spawn if you are offline, or unable to get to a spawn fast enough, is a hell of a sight worse than a one month wait, with a gaurenteed shot at the spawn when it comes up for you. <br>
<br>
The reason that the list is now 4 or 5 clerics deep is *not* because it is in skyfire, not sol b. It is because the spawn timer is almost doubled from the old one. If the spawn had been a 72 hour one, from the moment they moved it out of Sol B, there would be *double* the amount of ragefires since it happened. And no, that would not mean the list would be 2 or 3 clerics long instead of 4 or 5. It means that there would be no line, or at most, 1 cleric extra, because there would be a least, what, 10 more hearts that would have dropped in the same amount of time? <br>
<br>
Why hasn't verant fixed that? Because they are trying to limit the number of cleric epics on a server. They can program a spawn time to whatever they want to. 8 hour spawns, 2 hour spawned placeholders with a 24 hour spawn after the place holder dies before the rare pops, 24 hour spawns plus or minus 8 hours, they can program any spawn they'd like. And ragefire is now a 5 to 7 day timer, because they are asses about it. <br>
<br>
In any event, a list, as has been said *many* times before, is a nice thought, but is a *stupid* plan in practice. It will cause many disagreements, many hard feelings. <br>
<br>
Free For All will mean &quot;epics for some&quot;, not 'all' as is implied in the title of 'free for all'. It is a nice theory, to race to the mob, but in the case of Ragefire, a race is not only unfair, it's cruel, as a cleric sees two of their guild members online at 8 am, while another guild comes in and kills ragefire. <br>
<br>
What does that promote? <br>
<br>
Clerics who want their epic, can't be in a guild that can't kill a level 60 mob on zero notice in under 60 seconds, from port in to dead. <br>
<br>
Kudos to those of you who can. Try not to forget those who can't.<br>
<br>
Ragefire should be, and hopefully will always remain a &quot;sit there and wait&quot; camp. Until Verant makes the spawn timer 3 days, as it was before, and/or makes it a triggered spawn like faydedar, then the best solution that the rathe has, without decending into the stupid and debasing culture of the FFA ragefire, is to continue the camp as it is. <br>

<br>
If you think that a name on a list would protect a popped ragefire from being killed ASAP if the cleric wasn't present, with a force on the way, I hate to disappoint you. I try to be the most reasonable person I can when I play, and if I had 30 people in skyfire, and a cleric who could use the heart, I sure as hell wouldn't be waiting on a cleric who may or may not be online in the next 12 hours. I don't think that there is a guild on this server that would, in the case of ragefire, with 20+ guilds jockeying for position on him, and a 5 month wait on him in that situation. The only reason rotations like Sev work is because there aren't such huge waiting times on him. One every 3 days means fairly fast travel through a fairly short list. One every 7 days on a long list? Won't work. <br>
<br>

You have a right to be wrong, and I respect that. However, I could reply that 'the only real reason that people are whining about the list being removed is because they were closer to the top of it than the clerics currently camping ragefire and they don't want to put in the time to get the epic' or some equally annoying and unprovable statement to that end. <br>

<br>
I'm sure that a lot of people who supported the removal understand that the current situation is better than the one that would have come out of a list, or a FFA ragefire. <br>
<br>
In any event, I know I won't change the minds that are already made up, but I hope the undecided people understand that a FFA ragefire or a 5 month long list are both totally stupid ways to go, and neither would be good for the clerics involved. <br>

In all honesty our guild could do all the parts for cleric epic except rage in a day.  Cause we are a smaller guild our clerics arent pressing for there epics because the chances of us being able to get 1 person to sit in SF for weeks on end compounded with the fact that if RF DID pop for us it would most likely be at a time when we had 2-3 members on its just not worth it. <br>
<br>
Royals can be done with a group of 6. We did it a couple times just cause we got tired of grinding ex in the top of chardok. The eley is just as ez as the king and everthing else is soloable but the priest who can be duoed easily. <br>
<br>
We would much rather hold off doing all the other stuff till we have the RF piece in a clerics hand.  Reguardless of what order the epic is done in killin rage WILL result in a cleric epic in a very short amount of time.<br>
<br>
Look at trompen you say he didnt have king done when he got rage but how long after rage did he wield his epic....The biggiest problem with rage is the large guilds are going for cleric epic 10 or 11 which in reality has nill benefit to them as most there raids they have 40+ ppl there and more than likely 4+ epic clerics. The smaller guilds that are tryin for there 1st epic tend to lose out with verants messed up campin ideas, even though that smaller guilds epic would prove to be 10x more useful to them.<br>
<br>
Is this something to hold against the larger guilds...nope not a bit there fault any small guild would be doing the same thing if they could. Its Verants fault for creating such a bottleneck.<br>

<br>
He works for a living...and had the availability to camp when he could. Bear in mind I wasnt any more aware of the new agreement since the rage camp had changed in my absence.<br>
<br>
He took the time off to camp it , and i'd assume he did it knowing now he didnt have to wait forever and perhaps even longer due to his personal life schedule to get the rage part done.<br>
<br>
As others have said...there is no way to guarantee they have their note already. I wish it'd go back to Solb the way it used to be , in my opinion. <p>Karas LightStrider

If you have all the pieces leading up to him (king's note) then you should get in line, if not, it isn't fair. I mean, sure, the other parts aren't as hard, but let's use this example. Say 3 clerics are waiting in line now. Billybobjoecleric comes in without his note, and gets in line just as bobbyjoebobcleric gets his note. bobbyjoebob rushes over, and is now 5th in line waiting. He has to wait lets say... 6 weeks, and finally gets it. Meanwhile billy got his, and then stops playing EQ for a month's time, after which he comes back and gets the note and does the whole shabang. Bobby could have spent a hell of a lot less time waiting if billy had got his note first. <br>
<br>
See, the moral is, billy didn't need it now, and bobby did. Getting it out of the way is no excuse. I'd like to hop into Guk sometime and get the SMR to start my epic, but if someone is there camping it just for loot, can I go KS the magus just to get it out of the way? <br>
<br>
Im sure half of this hasn't made sense, and the grammar probably sucks, but this is my opinion at 2am, and most of what I said is probably going to be my opinion tommorow. <br>
<br>
That's how I stand, but Im sure I wont be the one deciding anyhow. <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif"</img> <br>
