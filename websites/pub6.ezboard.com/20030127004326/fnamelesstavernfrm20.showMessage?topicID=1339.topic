<br>
The Stella's are named after  81-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled coffee on herself and successfully sued McDonalds. That case inspired the Stella Awards for the most frivolous  successful lawsuits in the United States. <br>
<br>
The following are this year's  candidates:<br>
<br>
1. Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas, was awarded $780,000  by a jury of her peers after breaking her ankle tripping over a toddler who was running inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict, considering the misbehaving little toddler was Ms. Robertson's son.<br>
<br>
2. A 19-year-old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand  with a Honda Accord. Mr. Truman apparently didn't notice there was someone at the wheel of the car when he was trying to steal his neighbor's hub  caps.<br>
<br>
3. Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pennsylvania, was leaving a house he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go up since the automatic door opener was malfunctioning. He couldn't re-enter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation, and Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight  days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found, and a large bag of dry dog  food. He sued the homeowner's insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of $500,000.<br>
<br>
4. Jerry Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas, was awarded $14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door neighbor's beagle. The beagle was on a chain in its owner's fenced yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog might have been just a little provoked at the time by Mr. Williams who was shooting it repeatedly with a pellet gun.<br>
<br>
5. A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, $113,500 after she slipped on a soft drink and broke her coccyx (tailbone). The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson had thrown it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.<br>
<br>
6. Kara Walton of Claymont, Delaware, successfully sued the owner of a night club in a neighboring city when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.<br>
<br>
7. This year's favorite is Mr. Merv Grazinski of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new  32-foot Winnebago motor home. On his first trip home, having driven onto the freeway,he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat  to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee. Not surprisingly, the R.V. left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Mr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the owner's manual that he couldn't actually do this. The jury awarded him $1,750,000 plus a new motor home. The company actually changed their manuals on the basis of this suit, just in case there were any other complete morons buying their recreation vehicles.<br>

All of those lawsuits in the first post in the thread are fakes .....<br>
<br>
There are quite a few equally crazy ones that are real though.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In March 1995, a San Diego man unsuccessfully attempted to sue the city and Jack Murphy Stadium for $5.4 million over something than can only be described as a wee problem -- Robert Glaser claimed the stadium's unisex bathroom policy at a Billy Joel and Elton John concert caused him embarrassment and emotional distress thanks to the sight of a woman using a urinal in front of him. He subsequently tried &quot;six or seven&quot; other bathrooms in the stadium only to find women in all of them. He asserted he &quot;had to hold it in for four hours&quot; because he was too embarrassed to share the public bathrooms with women. <br>
<br>
A San Carlos, California, man is suing the Escondido Public Library for $1.5 million. His dog, a 50-pound Labrador mix, was attacked by the library's 12-pound feline mascot, L.C., (also known as Library Cat). <br>
<br>
In 1994, a student at the University of Idaho unsuccessfully sued that institution over his fall from a third-floor dorm window. He'd been mooning other students when the window gave way. It was contended the University failed to provide a safe environment for students or to properly warn them of the dangers inherent to upper-story windows. <br>
<br>
In 1993, McDonald's was unsuccessfully sued over a car accident in New Jersey. While driving, a man who had placed a milkshake between his legs, leaned over to reach into his bag of food and squeezed the milkshake container in the process. When the lid popped off and spilled half the drink in his lap, this driver became distracted and ran into another man's car. That man in turn tried to sue McDonald's for causing the accident, saying the restaurant should have cautioned the man who had hit him against eating while driving. <br>

In June 2002, the [New York] Daily News presented it solely as an e-mail it had received, making no statements as to its likeliness to be real or detailing any attempts that publication might have made to verify any of the entries.

Sorry for the extensive quoting but I am getting rather tired of stuff like that being circulated. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I am sure that urban tales will end at the same moment as spam. But it would be nice if you saw them a bit less atleast.<br>

He shouldn't get the money b/c he beat her and she was leaving him. It wasnt his money. Marriage is a partnership, and both partners put something into it, when you split it up both sides need to be compensated for their share. Is it right that the spouse who cheated, or who put nothing into the partnership get's more out of it? Of course! Which is exactly why that @#%$ shouldn't have gotten HER money. <br>
<br>
Think about it this way, if you expect your wife to put her ambitions and life on hold so the two of you can have children, or so you can get more education or need her to stop going to school to work so you can make ends meat, think about the intangible things she is forfeiting for you, and then maybe you would understand why the she should get some of those things you bought. Likewise, if situations are reversed (which they very well could be) the man will be compensated in the same way.  <p><center> <b> Sydnia Pandajones

I am all in favor of Congress making a common sense law stating that anyone who attempts to sue anyone else for an amount over $5000 for personal injuries, mental stress, etc. be sentenced to one month in a maximum security prison in the event the case is lost.  I think that would free up the court system to do what it was designed to do. <p>Labbats Brew <br>
