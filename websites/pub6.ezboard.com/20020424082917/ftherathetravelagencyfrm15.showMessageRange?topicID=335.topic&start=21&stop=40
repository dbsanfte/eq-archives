And it's the truth.<br>
<br>
I am not opposed to using a retired player's account for a specific task (jewelcraft, rezzing, corpse summons, whatever.) but if an experienced high level warrior starts trying to use his old buddie's high level enchanter on a raid situation, as good as he is and as experienced in the high end raiding game as he is, odds are very good that everyone is going to die. <br>
<br>
  Smart players know this to be the case, and unless the 'ebayed' toon has proven himself competent many many times over, that person will have a VERY hard time getting any acceptance with prudent players,  unless they find a save haven guild of fellow ebayers.  <p>Jurrasic Epoch <BR>

I would hate to have someone playing my character after I left with the possibility of destroying/improving my previous reputation *grin*<br>
<br>
Thankyou for bringing this aspect up Rogg as I had completely overlooked it.<br>
<br>
Any self respecting person wouldn't dream of selling their character/reputation on e-bay for the fear of that happening.<br>
<br>
So does that beg to say that all e-bay characters that are sold must have previously had a bad reputation else they wouldn't sell their character, or is it that the person doesn't give a hoot about what that reputation means to themself ?<br>
<br>
I think that goes for more than e-bay, it moves to anyone allowing other people to take ownership of ones character for more than occasional use. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushadow2051.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadow2051</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/14/01 9:26:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Ha...</span><hr size=1> That is.. incredibly hypocritical.

After all they're not &quot;learning&quot; the game inside out, but getting a few buffs slapped on them and letting THOSE do the work. There is nothing wrong with ebaying.. most people who EBAY tend to have bad reputations and they want to get away. If those people want to get those and work up the reputation, let them be, don't smash them down any further. All of you &quot;uberguilds&quot; have ebayers, yet you don't say ANYTHING about them.

<br>
<br>
I only have Two things to say about this.<br>
<br>
1- I knew the OLD Makmut. I used to never come here, so I do not have the pulse on certain things that go on in the Rathe. But I meet the &quot;new&quot; makmut in Sebilis (do not know which incarnation of this guy it was at the time). I tried to spark up a conversation with him (thinking he was my old friend). He says greetings and wow, have not seen you in a long time, etc etc. He mentions how he lost everything, and only has a few pieces of hate/fear armor and his dain hammer. I mentioned that seeing that he was an old buddy, I will see what I can do about getting him on some raids to help him out better.<br>
<br>
Later that night, when I bring it up to some of my guild, I find out that he was e-bayed and that he (makmut) is not the original. So this &quot;Makmut&quot; was using that E-bayed characters name to Fool people.<br>
<br>
I know if I e-bayed my character and no one knew about it, and the new &quot;tzuten&quot; tried to assume my identity to get friends, items or help on things. Alot of people would get pissed.<br>
<br>
2- It is EASY to say, that I level 7 characters to 1-60 on another server. <br>
<br>
It is kinda like saying when you were back in High School, that you had a girlfriend in Canada or something. <br>
<br>
Okies, let say he DID spend all the time/effort to level &quot;Seven&quot; characters from 1-60 on many servers. How does that say about his loyality? You might /log on one day and Makmut  might be another totally new person. How would you or your guild like that?<br>
<br>
Again..this is my 2cp on this subject.<br>
<br>
It was said before, &quot;Respect is EARNED, not bought&quot; <p><p align="center"><map name="FPMap0">

<br>
There is, by the way, a such thing as /report<br>
<br>
He can't come post here that he isnt the origonal. He can't even say that the origonal gave the account to him, even that is banable. With all this crap going on about him on the board can you seriously expect him to say anything differently?<br>
<br>
You should get off his back. <br>

<br>
Verant can't do a good go'dd'amn thing about anything anyone says on these boards. They are not under verants direct control, and they would be unable to prove that people are who they say they are, based on these boards. <br>
<br>
To be more concise: I could go make an EZ board account that say I am Aradune, or Ester, or anyone, and come back and post, I could name myself Laenaya and copy your signature, etc etc. Verant can't enforce anything that anyone on this board says or eludes to. In game, yes, I concede the point that he could be /reported for ebaying if he admitted it. <br>
<br>
I'd bet money that nothing would be done, however. <br>
Verant only says it's against the rules because it would ruin the integrity of the game if they said &quot;yes, you can buy and sell your gear on ebay, with our compliments&quot; because they know that people would make a full time job out of it. See, if you examine verants motives, it's not to keep the player happy, oh no. We're basically gerbils hitting a button to get food pellets, and they have given us a chat room to do it in as well. Nope, the player is happy to be simply 'playing' so they only thing Verant has to do is make sure that A) the player can see the rewards of continued playing and that B) they believe that the only way to get those rewards is to keep playing. <br>
<br>
Example: Did any of you LIKE being level 54? 59? Big, DEEP, UGLY hell levels. Yes, they were nice to get to, but after 3 orange in 54, I want to DIE when I don't see the xp bar move over 2 nights of grinding <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Verant just has to make it clear that to get a level 60, you have to play, not pay, and we will line up forever to keep going (well, us compulsive and addictive types)<br>
<br>
So, for those reasons, let the 'new' Makmut come to the boards and scream from the hill tops that he is bought, sold, traded, stolen, however he is in ownership of Makmut if he is so inclined. My guess is not that he wants to post and feels threatened by Verant, it's probably more to the tune of he doesn't care, or doesn't want to face the obvious hostility (which, I admit, borders on fanatical levels sometimes, but /shrug, that's the way it is)<br>

<br>
The legal standpoint of that was due to the deritive nature of the work... similar to how Alfred Bester would get pissed at me if I wrote a story about the movement of humans to another evolutionary level guided by creatures from another planet (Childhood's End). It had nothing to do with people buying/selling their accounts, but instead making derivitive work. In addition, the hotbutton of &quot;Child Pornography&quot; got pushed by an overzealous parent who obviously believes that personal expression is utterly overruled by their own values.<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah, and verants resulting decision from that event was likely nothing more than a knee jerk reaction to try to stop &quot;Child porn&quot; and &quot;everquest&quot; from appearing in the same sentence at any given time. Makes great business practice, really. You wouldn't believe the number of people don't shop at a store that proudly says they support childmolesting. <br>
<br>
You know what else makes good business practice? Letting people pay for accounts that aren't really theirs. <br>
<br>
Hell, if Verant wanted to actually enforce the stuff they say are the 'rules' about transferring accounts, etc etc, then Makmut's own guildmates have written on numerous occasions that he is not the original, that he ebay'd but they didn't, etc etc. <br>
<br>
Before you say that they would need his own collaboration, they wouldn't. That's where the &quot;at our sole descretion&quot; part of the EULA comes in. Yep, they can ban at will, for no infraction if they so choose. They just don't by convention and in an effort to continue their domination of the market. <br>
<br>
Every ebay's 10 bucks is worth more to them than sticking to their 'rules'.<br>
<br>

F'uck 'em. This server seems to have a better way to deal with ebayers anyway...Something to the tune of.../point /laugh /rude. <br>
