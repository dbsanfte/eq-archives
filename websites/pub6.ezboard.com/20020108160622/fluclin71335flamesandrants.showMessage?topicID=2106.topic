<br>
I am so tired of seeing peeps getting banned for &quot;violating the rules&quot;.... violate this bic.<br>
<br>
The word &quot;rules&quot; should not even be in the same topic of flames and rants. <br>
<br>
I mean seriously, what the hell is this section for then? (bic speaking) &quot;oh, you can come here and bring up topics and have discussions on things that make you mad, but just dont go swearing, or using racial slurs , or insulting anyone based on sex or sexual preference&quot;.... etc... <br>
<br>
F U<br>
This is Flames and Rants<br>
What? I'm supposed to get on someone's @#%$ and flame them without cussing? Why? I cant personally attack them cuz you dont want their feelings hurt? screw you.<br>
<br>
If the &quot;im so innocent&quot; good people and the &quot;oh im so offended&quot; people cant handle the content here, then dont friggin come in. <br>
<br>
How bout if i say I am offended by YAEN preaching religion like he's a freakin choir boy that got one too many preacher coks in the @ss. I mean who the hell wants to read about the history of your so called god... idiot.<br>
<br>
Or how bout those of us that just cant stand anymore of Vyperhand's god damn ego trips? I mean really, can't he jam his fist in his ass telling himself how much he loves himself on his own time??<br>
<br>
Or even Zeus, whom was by far the most insulting on the site, being banned... sure he was offensive, but what do you want him to say when posting a flame?  should he say &quot;and player_01 from AC should really learn to pull better and use FD , contact me in game so I can help teach you so you dont get us wiped out next time&quot;, or cant he just say &quot; listen you trailer trash piece of @#%$, you suxor , cancel your account... go play PS2 where you dont affect others you F-ing hick&quot;<br>
<br>
Or perhaps some people find Cobee offensive... I mean that much asskissing to everyone and thier brother is a bit much for all of us...<br>
<br>
My point is, is anything can be offensive, so my question is , <br>
BIC , who are you to play god the creator on this site. Oh cuz you run it, big friggin deal. So you choose what is acceptable and non acceptable? thats fair? <br>
Didnt hitler rule things the same way?<br>
<br>
How bout this, put up a friggin pop up page that says &quot;this page can be offensive&quot; and let us flame peeps the way we want. OR make a section called &quot;polite flames and rants&quot; and &quot;Offensive flames and rants&quot;.<br>
<br>
Canceling my account Bic only proves my point you friggin tree hugger.<br>

Yeah, Bic gets to run the show cause uhhh, he's the boss.  Kinda like how my boss at work gets to tell me what to do cause he's the boss.  Tool.  If you don't like how the board is moderated, make yer own.  ezboard.com, not hard to find even though you apparently do not have oppsible thumbs.<br>

In case this was over your head, let me add the following insult: &quot;You smell like the underside of a hyena's foreskin.&quot;<br>

This was not an attack on his sexual preference, it was an implication that anon_flamer_ad_naseum is in fact an inbreeder.  I also insinuated in a later post that a secret service agent shooting him in his head would be for the better.  <br>
<br>
I don't really give a rats ass what gets posted here, but it just SCREAMS &quot;I'm a 13 year old rebel without a cause&quot; to bitch at Bic about doing his job.  I guess we should just all go elsewhere since anon_flamer_ad_naseaum doesn't like how the board is moderated.  If you don't like the f.cuking rules in this sandbox, go play in yer own.<br>

No, in fact I don't know and have never talked to Bic in game.  Unlike you however, Bic seems to have a generally have a clue and is willing to sacrifice his time to mod this board.  If he posted something I deemed flame-worthy I'd light him up like the 4th of July and roast baby rabbits over the charing corpse.<br>
<br>
Now, on to other parts of your /whining post.  Look kid, the bottom line is this.  You start a thread whining about &quot;don't ban for this, don't ban for that, don't edit, blah blah F.UCKING blah.  Well, before your useless, fleshbag self started posting here a set of rules were established.  So who the f.uck are you to roll up, throw a temper-tantrum and thrash about saying &quot;I don't like the rules, you should do it MY WAY!&quot;  The vast majority of people here don't want to do things your way.  To god damn bad.  In addition (and if you've read these boards at all, you should know this), anon flamers get about zero credit here.  If you had 1500 posts on this board and 25% of them showed a smattering of intelligent life, I might think about your babbling, but since you chose to hide behind the wall of anon posters you get no cred.<br>

Alot of &quot;non uptight&quot; people actually DO like to see the insults and find humor in it. Tends to make things interesting as opposed to a Polite Flame.<br>
<br>
Also, balt, just because you put a period in between letters of your curse words doesnt mean that you are not breaking the rules. You too could be banned for that. <br>
<br>
That is the exact point I am trying to make because I (and others) dont see the point in &quot;tightening&quot; up on the rules of what can and cant be said under this section.<br>

If putting a &quot;.&quot; in f.uck is a bannable offense then ban me.  Only 1000 other EQ boards to lurk while I'm bored at work.  <br>
<br>
I said this already, but it's not getting through.  This board has rules (rules I may have violated), if you don't like them, got post somewhere else.  Then you wanna spew some drivel about &quot;when they came for the jews...&quot;<br>
<br>
Chief, if you can't see the difference in a set of rules posted to set guidelines on a message board for a fantasy game, and a set of rules that led the extermination of several million people...then I pity you.  If you see any corilation between the two you have less common sense than a bag of hammers.<br>

<br>
Run along now, your welfare check is probably in the mail. That way you can use those hard earned bucks to play EQ some more.<br>
<br>
I'm just glad the &quot;public&quot; doesn't have to pick up the tab for all of your corpses that litter EQ.<br>

This isn't a democracy.  The moderators rule with absolute power - there are no checks and balances.  There's really nothing to prevent them from doing whatever they want.<br>
<br>
If you don't like it, go somewhere else.<br>

When is the &quot;insta ban of anon flamers&quot; rule coming anyway? <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32212'>Aezon Shmaezon</a><br>
