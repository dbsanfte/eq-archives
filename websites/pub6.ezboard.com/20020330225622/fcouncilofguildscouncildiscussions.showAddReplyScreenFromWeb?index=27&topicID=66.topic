I have since deleted it, and written a whole new long one.  I apologize.<br>
<br>
This comes down to one thing.  Respect.  Shattering Steel does not respect anyone else on the server.  Therefore they have no right at all to expect any back.  They have consistantly shown through their ingame actions that they are only concerned for their own well being, rather than that of their neighbors and the guilds around them.  Perhaps the individual members of Shattering Steel are nice people.  That does not excuse the behavior of their guild.  <br>
<br>
Jezelbelle, you and Filidar both have accused the guilds that make up KGC of harrassment of members of Shattering Steel when it was not the guilds that were at fault but rather the members of the guilds.  Now you both have said that actions taken by a member of a guild reflect either well or bad upon the guild itself.  I agree.  But now lets take it a step further.  Do not the actions of a guild then reflect either well or badly upon the members themselves?  If a guild leader and officer are to be held responsible for the somewhat uncontrollable actions of a member, cannot a member be held responsible for the actions of a guild leader or officer?  A member of Shattering Steel may be nice, but their leadership has proven that they are only interested in hurting others.<br>
<br>
Both Miyabi and OAKS Alliance now have lost hours of their play time due to Shattering Steel.  You simply cannot reasonably camp a Plane unless you have 150+ members who can cycle through their sleep times since the spawns are between 8-24-72 hours.  Thats real time.  How do you think Miyabi or OAKS felt when they spent 2-3kpp buffing themselves, and several hours organizing, creating lists, porting people around, only to port up to Hate and find it empty?  Can they go elsewhere?  I suppose they can, but what about all the time wasted?  Shattering Steel's actions cannot be defended upon the basis of right or wrong.  They are obviously intending to only further themselves.<br>
<br>
The Karana server has long stood united in the idea that if we work together we can all benefit.  This means everyone, not just the uber guilds, but the small guilds, the medium guilds, even the guildless.  With the rotation system we can all have access to the Planes and large targets.  We can setup at our own pace, we can have fun, we can enjoy ourselves instead of just worring about getting to the target in time.  Shattering Steel is trying to destroy the very sense of community and trust that exists on Karana and NO WHERE ELSE on any of the servers.  You will not find a single server out there that is like Karana.  I think this is worth fighting for.  Not just for me, but for you, and the people around me.  Indeed for me its rather irrelevent.  In an FFA situation I'd just petition and join an uber guild.  But neither I nor the uber guilds want to see the smaller guilds hurt.<br>
<br>
If Shattering Steel is so upright and honest, I ask you where are they?  Where are their public reponses to our accusations?  Why have they not refuted our postition with their own?  Why have they not tried to talk to the other guilds?  I submit to you it is because the leadership of Shattering Steel has no intention of doing so.  They have told their members not to post anything because they are afraid of the light.  They are afraid that once their position becomes public they will lose what little support they have.  If they have a defendable platform I would like to hear it.  But my guess is all they can say is We are hardcore, you are losers, deal with it.  Well, we are dealing with it.  If they dont like it I suggest they leave Shattering Steel as soon as possible and join any of the hundreds of other guilds on Karana that would accept them.  All we've ever asked is for people to respect each other and cooperate.  We're here to have fun, not just a few hardcore players, but everyone.<br>
<br>
And Fildiar, how else do you suggest we solve things?  Perhaps if Shattering Steel is willing to talk to other guild leaders in a public forum then yes the boycott should stop.  But until then, what choice do we have?  If you have a solution please post it.  We need ideas here, and specific ones, not just pleas to stop.  We all want to stop, but not at the risk losing the very communities we've built here.<br>

They are all used to a FFA system and have no clue as to it's benefits. We can't help their ignorance at standing up for a guild on just another server (in their eyes) that wants to do the same thing they already do.<br>
<br>
They have peaded for outside support to try and strengthen their position by putting out false (some but not all granted) examples of them being &quot;wronged&quot; and are trying to get other guilds elsewhere to back them up.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of listening to their sap stories about how they &quot;just wanna have fun&quot;. well if they do, then mass move servers. It's only $150 US, trust me there's a few of you I wouldn't miss.<br>
<br>
Jez, to you specifically, until you actually understand what it's like to sit and wait 6 hours for even one mob to spawn that was yours, then maybe just listen and find out more before backing a decision that the masses have deemed is their wrongdoing. Are you even from Karana Server?<br>
<br>
To any outsiders reading this thread since I know this site was posted elsewhere - until you have a planes capable character on this server and actually SEE how our rotation works, I personally, and probably quite a few others, would prefer if you went back to your own server and dealt with your own KS problems before trying to be richeous and claiming ours is wrong and &quot;how can they hurt you? all they're doing is going FFA&quot;<br>
<br>
And for the people that feel they were &quot;forced&quot; off the server at the last split.. DAMN STRAIGHT some of you were! 2 past Ubers tried to go FFA, they failed and with their tail between their legs, they left. You want someone to blame? go speak with your GL and ask why they made a guildwide decision that would inevitably destroy you all.<br>
<br>
If you have the balls you can move back now, personally I'd rather not have you back though.<br>
<br>
Do I sound malicious or annoyed? sure thing. I dont care how nice someone is, if they make life miserable for everyone else, or contribute to that end even by being affiliated with them I have no use for them. NONE. When they leave that guild I would be more than happy to deal with them again, until then, they can rot in hell, ALL of them.<br>

I mean you waited 4 weeks to do this now its gonna be a week before she respawns.<br>
<br>
Bottomline is that the KGC makes it possible for large targets and hard zones to be hunted by smaller guilds or alliances in order for everyone on the server that wants the chance to have it.If SS were to succeed then basically the only guilds that could assemble fast enough and with enough force to do these raids would be the uber guilds.Now if you arent aware of the requirements to be in some of the strongest guilds on Karana maybe you should read the charter basically you must attend the raids if you are online and you have to be present more than absent,now somepeople can do that and enjoy it some dont have the time or desire to raid so often so they choose to join smaller guilds without the requirements,my point is do you want Karana to be a server that you have to join a guild that you dont want  but have to just  to have a shot at the large targets? or would you like it to stay like it is and make your choice as to what guild you are in and know you have the same oppertunities as the large guilds? I vote for choosing my guild because its the guild i like and not the guild I have to in order to take a dragon or plane.<br>

Let me clarify whose side I am on in this matter, I'm with KGC. What I was trying to say in my last post was for the harrassment to stop, of not just SS  members, but everyone  who in someway  is involved with them. Bocott (spelled  it wrong, I know, but  in a rush, want to ding hehe)  them is your choice, I'm not  saying thats wrong or right. No tp's or rez's is one thing, but when people send tells with threats and bad language, thats something totally different. You have crossed a line then, from Bocott (no rez's, etc) to harrassment (language  and threats). <br>
<br>
Kellory, I did not  mean in my  post earlier  anything about the guilds on karana server, I posted here cause I  know many people will see it and read it. I did not mean in anyway that if a  member of any guild  did this, it reflex his guild. The  post was ment for people to read it, and if they are one of the ones who have crossed the line, they have a chance to rethink what  they  did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscouncildiscussions>Council Discussions</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
