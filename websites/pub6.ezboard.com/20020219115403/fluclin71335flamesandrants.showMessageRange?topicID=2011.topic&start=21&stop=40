How can you not care if someone tried to commet suicide?  And you see one of your 'friends'(Guildmate) making fun of them and pushing them for it?  I forgot, you have to have basic human decency for that.

<br>
If something tragic happened to your RL friends happened, would you not want it to be published on an internet public board?  I don't think so.  You would want to respect the persons privacy.  <br>
<br>
Sky isn't just being ripped on for training some frigging monsters in a stupid zone in a game.  He's being attacked BECAUSE he brought out something that someone wanted to be kept private on a public forum.  Ask yourself this...if this happened to your RL best friend or a close one, would YOU want this on the net?  F*** no.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, friendships in RL are made through EQ.  And, like a good friend, I stick up for those who get attacked like this...humiliated like this.  <br>
<br>
So ask yourself what I asked above...about respecting peoples RL privacy, before defending him and saying he's right to bring that out in the public.  Think about it.<br>

<br>
People do not &quot;pretend to commit suicide for attention&quot;.  People attempt suicide because they feel like they've lost all hope.<br>
<br>
Yes, I felt that way.  I had a rough breakup a few months back, I was out of school (and since I worked at school, I lost my job), my friends were all off in school, so I spent most of my day sitting at home staring at my computer screen.  Yes, it's quite sad and pathetic, but that's how it happened...<br>
<br>
I'm personally not thinking &quot;all of LoS are assholes who don't care&quot; because I know some members of LoS and I know that some of them are pretty cool people, so I hope none of you think that =) I was pretty shocked that Sky would cross the line of EQ and say what he said.  I would never tell the world of EQ of the RL things I've known Sky to be infamous for, because frankly, if he doesn't want it to be known, then it's none of my business to say anything.<br>
<br>
How am I doing now? Better.  Great? Nah, but better than before, which is a step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Sky wanted attention and he got it, I'm sure he's happy in his own twisted sick way.<br>

There are ways that will definitely kill you, there are ways that might kill you or might not, and there are ways that sure as hell aren't going to kill you, and in fact are almost guaranteed to get you caught and draw attention to it.  Like that guy who tried to commit suicide by eating 200 aspirin.  WTF.<br>
<br>
Rasp, no, that's not saying you're the third type, just wanted to clear that up.  I've had way too many friends that chose the third method to believe that nobody ever does it when deep down all the want is attention.<br>

I dont agree nor disagree with what Sky did and or said, Rasplorien and him have been at eachother for quite a while now. I dont pretend to like Rasp I aslo dont hate him, simply put I dont know him. What Sky said was out of anger because 150 of you dumb fucks decided to gang up on him for attempting to clear the water over an incident. <br>
<br>
Sky is one of the nicest, caring, helpfull and genuine people I know. You @#%$ &quot;short bus&quot; dumb fucks constanty personify stupidity with your jealous accusations against LoS, and then once one of their newer members posts he all of the sudden &quot;bragging about being in LoS&quot;. How many of you even know the people in LoS? Very few id bet, ITS A GOD DAMN GAME YOU JEALOUS @#%$ FREAKSHOWS.<br>
<br>
@#%$ go back to the box in the basement you crawled out of and chain yourself back up. I have h8 for almost no people in EQ and quite enjoy playing but when Fuckface 012321321223312 posts a direct attack on my friend whom fuckface doesnt even know then @#%$ that.<br>
<br>
Maybe just maybe some of you could understand that Sky is human he makes mistakes and I will bet my life that he regrets that post, even regrets starting that thread.  <p><img src="http://www.goodhomes.8m.com/wiz4.jpg"
