Older post on my guild's class boards, figured I'd share. it's a little dated, but enjoy!<br>
<br>
There does not exist a melee class that cannot take aggro from us with a well timed, or ill timed, button push. <br>
<br>
Paladins load up a stun or group heal. Shadowknights drop a dot and a couple of lifetaps. Monks put out damage in speeds that rival F16s. Rogues land double backstabs for 450+. Bards sing songs that buff their entire party, heal, and do damage simultainiously. Rangers snare, taunt, kick, and generally never let you have aggro if they don't want you to. <br>
<br>
There does not exist a caster class that cannot take aggro from us with a single well timed or ill timed button push. Clerics complete healing the almost-dead-puller at the begining of the fight, wizards landing the 1615 damage nuke, the enchanters doing anything at all, shaman slows, even necromancer dots are incredibly high taunt compaired to the medium damage output and speed of a typical warrior.<br>
<br>
So what is it that warriors do? Our damage output is just above paladin, and in pure damage per second, I'd approximate us up there with a shadowknight with a nice weapon and a couple of dots on the mob. Nothing to write home about for sure. You will never see &quot;Warrior&quot; in a list of damage dealing classes for raids or groups (rogues/rangers/monks)<br>
<br>
I'll tell you what warriors do. <br>
<br>
We stand toe to toe with *any* mob even close to our level,and we *lose* if we are not backed up by good, competant players. And we know that, going into the situation, that we are *dead* if we are not supported. <br>
<br>
When a warrior says that they are ready to pull, or ready to fight, they are not saying that they have any ability to do anything other than get flattened. They are saying that they trust the group they are with, and the players to do a good job. <br>
<br>
Where every other class in the game has some form of sustainable or one shot, escape route, warrior is alone in their dependance on others. No heals, no feign death, no spells to save us, we live or die on the ability of our groupmates. <br>
<br>
If you do not trust people in this game, or do not think that you could ever look into the face of incoming four hundred damage-per-hit quadruple strikes, and say &quot;yeah, I can do that alone for 30 seconds, just toss me a heal when I start bleeding&quot;, don't play a warrior. <br>
<br>
If you don't look at the prospect of fighting a creature that can kill you in *three* seconds, and *will* kill you in 3 seconds with a great deal of excitement and enthusiasm... don't play a warrior. <br>
<br>
Because here is what warriors do: We ask for damage. We beg for it. We taunt for it. Hell, we sometimes even pay for it. <br>
<br>
Anything and everything that we can do to make sure the mob hates *us* and no one else, that's what we do. If I need a mobs attention, like, RIGHT NOW, I will even sit down to take the aggro from a cleric or enchanter who is going to die. That means the mob gets a free round of full damage hits on me, if they connect. And I will keep taunting, asking for more attention. Seeing red text on my screen means that I'm doing my job. If I die first, it means I was doing my job. <br>
<br>
It is a personal insult and failure each and every time a mob breaks from combat with me, to hit any other member of my group, or raiding crew. It means *I* wasn't doing my job because someone else was getting hit. <br>
<br>
A good warrior is a protector. Like an enchanter defends the group against large pulls, the warrior defends the group against one mob, while the rest of the group does their jobs. We hold the mob, we delay it. If we are not solid and unwavering, our groups often die right after we do, to mobs that have their aggro spread so thinly amongst all others, that they race from member to member, laying out hits without any organized returning damage. <br>
<br>
Playing a warrior is one of the most rewarding, and fun times I've ever had out of a game like this. The steady input of damage versus the talent and skill of the person(s) keeping me alive is a great balancing act, and is one that I enjoy being the hinging point of. <br>
<br>
At our next ToV raid, I will record a log of the way the fights are seen from my view, and show you all how much fun a warrior has in a fight like this. <br>
<br>
It really is a great time  <br>
<br>
So yeah, if you thirst for toe to toe, give me all you have, reap-the-whirlwind mob fights, play a warrior, and live for the damage. But never forget, that no other class is so dependant on everyone else for their success, and never forget that if *anyone* else dropped the ball, you were probably going to die first. <br>
<br>
Appreciate every fight you live through. Understand the fights you don't, if they are unavoidable. Forgive the ones that were avoidable, unless done out of cruelty. <br>
<br>
Now, with the propaganda part done, on to a little bit of strategy that works for me. Please add or subtract to it where you think it can be improved  <br>
<br>
<br>
Warriors in groups:<br>
<br>
1. Your first, and most important concern is the enchanter. No other class comes first in rank of importance. Save the enchanter, at any cost. <br>
<br>
I know, some people will think &quot;clerics?&quot;. But the number of times I have seen a group without a healer, kill four or five mobs on a pull has overshadowed the importance of crowd control, for me, over healing. As a warrior, you can lock down *one* mob, for a time equal to the time it takes that mob, to do your total hp in damage. In much less than that time, with a hasted and buffed group, it is often possible to kill a single mob, with concentrated effort. Since an enchanter effectively makes a multiple mob encounter *into* a single mob encounter, you can repeat the process without a healer. Not indefinately, but at least as long as it takes to recover from a link dead cleric.<br>
<br>
2. Secondly, whoever is providing you with health is your next important person in the group. 4 mobs that can each kill you before the group kills them, is a losing situation, enchanter or no enchanter. <br>
<br>
It can be a Cleric. It can be a ranger. It can be *any* class who can make the damage in, before you die, be less than the damage healed. I have been healed by druids, rangers, paladins, necromancers, enchanters with bedlams and runes, monks with bind wound, and bards with restoration songs. What class is healing the group is far less important to you than keeping that healer alive.<br>
<br>
3. Everyone else<br>
<br>
In a group situation, you are likely, if the only warrior, going to be the *best* place for damage to come into the group. You have the tools to get aggro and the ability to keep it. Everyone else's job will be to either survive long enough to do their damage to the mob, or to support you in your killing of the mob. If they die, you die. So don't let them die. <br>
<br>
In a group situation where you are not the only warrior, judge by AC, total HP and level who should be the 'tank' and who should be 'ready-to-be-the-tank'. The tank soaks damage and holds aggro. <br>
<br>
If you are not the tank, you should be ready to be the tank, by taunting approximately half as fast as you normally could be, by bashing to interupt spells only, so not to create additional &quot;oh, you stunned me, you bastard&quot; aggro. As well, attacking from a greater distance also helps deminish the amount that the mobs care about you. Also, if you are trying to not take aggro, try to be behind the mob, as you will avoid taking riposte damage. If you are not the tank, making more work for the healer is completely counter productive. <br>
<br>
Doing this will ensure that if your tank dies, or goes link dead, that you have maintained sufficent aggro to suddenly assume the role of the actual tank for the group.<br>
<br>
4. You<br>
<br>
Your role is to be the first to die. The mobs reach your groupmates by climbing over your corpse, and only then. You keep the mob off the other five people in your group, so help you God. (Whichever one you worship, that is. The great God Agnostic in my case *wink*)<br>
<br>
Bottom line. <br>
<br>
The classes that will do more damage than you must live to do that damage. The classes that will keep you sped up and healed and the mobs slowed and dying, must live to provide those abilities. You are a lynchpin in a difficult situation. I'm not talking about one where, oh, I guess the ranger could tank if you died. Or, I guess the cleric would have enough mana to keep a monk tank alive. I'm talking about situations where the most efficency is required to survive. That's you. <br>
<br>
Warriors on Raids, non main tank role:<br>
<br>
If you are not main tank on raids, you still have a very solid role to play. <br>
<br>
1. Against situations where more than one mob can enter camp, you should be ready to watch for a split tank call, in case your enchanters die, or the mobs are not mezzable.<br>
<br>
2. In situations where more than one mez'd mob is in camp, you should position yourself in a way that you can see as many mobs as possible while on the assist. If one of the mobs break mez and kill the enchanter, you should be able to charge it and begin tanking it before it moves to other casters, even before a split tank call is made by raid leaders who may or may not have seen the issue. This applies only when the enchanters are dead, link dead, or otherwise unable to remez a previously mez'd mob. Also mind that bards can, in some cases, mez mobs as well, though not the particularly powerful ones. This means you have to be incredibly aware of your situation. If there is one enchanter that you didn't know was there, you risk causing more death, not preventing it. Know everything, and you will be fine. <br>
<br>
3. If there is only going to be, ideally, one mob in camp, and you are not the main tank, NO YOU MAY NOT RELAX. Each warrior has an obligation to know where and when mobs can aggro from. They should note where their groupmates are sitting, and make sure to position themselves, sitting, between their group members and the direction that adds could come from. This makes sure that *any* aggro that is unintended, is on the warrior first. If the puller calls to be standing, you naturally stand up, as does everyone: you are *still* the first line of defense against potential aggro. <br>
<br>
All warriors should have a button that indicate that they have aggro and from what mob. If the mob is not mezzable, do not wait for a slow main tank. Begin tanking, and allow the main tank to catch up once they have engaged. Turn your autoattack off and stop taunting until the main tank has taken aggro from you. If your main tank is fairly fast, this will not cause any problems at all. Only do this, however, when there are no mobs in camp, and the main assist is not engaged, unless the split tank call has been made. <br>
<br>
Why? Because if you stand still and let the mob beat on you, it may instead turn and aggro a chewy cleric or enchanter who were nearby, or sitting. <br>
<br>
There is a specific order of mob hatred, in that if you put a warrior and an enchanter at equal distances from a mob inside their aggro range, they will pick the enchanter. Do not let the mob pick anyone. Force the mob to choose who you want. <br>
<br>
For warriors on raids in a main tank role:<br>
<br>
Make sure you are full health after every fight. Healing makes the mob angry at other people. You do not want that until absolutely necessairy. <br>
<br>
If your mob casts, be certain to time whatever means you use to interupt a spell so that you *can* interupt casting. Interupting casting is a bigger taunt than just hitting them with your bash. <br>
<br>
Make sure that other people do not engage until you have generated about 650+ damage. You can not outdistance someone on the hate list, if they are also doing any substantial damage to the mob as well: if they are not doing substantial damage, it doesn't matter if they are not attacking. <br>
<br>
In any case, ask them to wait until you feel you have put yourself so high above them on the mob's hate list that you will be the first thing the mob summons, and the last thing the mob summons (minus debuffers, we'll discuss that in a moment)<br>
<br>
After you have built up what you feel is a sufficent amount of aggro to hold the attention of the mob off the people raiding, call your melee into the attack. Ideally, the melee should be spread around the mob, with approximately a quarter of the melee on each side. <br>
<br>
This serves several purposes: It keeps the mob positioned in the center of the fighting area. Movement of the mob is quite bad, as people are unable to see their target, or unable to move through the press of bodies to get to their target. Keep the mob in the center, and try not to move them much. <br>
<br>
There are exceptions to this, as are obviously the case with our AEing wurms in Temple of Veeshan. Keeping them in the center would allow their AE to punish all raiders, not just the melee. If all the melee do their job on a raid, a healer should not be caught by a known AEing mob under most circumstances. <br>
<br>
Main Tank Vs Debuffers<br>
<br>
Against the very taunt drawing debuffs of Tash, Slow, Malo, Occlusion of Sound, and Disjunction, there is not a whole lot you can do to maintain your position at the top of the hatelist. Be prepared and know what is coming, and when, and you can pick a fight you can win, in terms of aggro management. <br>
<br>
All you can really do is be co-ordinated enough with your fellow raiders to know when the tash, malo, or other debilitating debuff is landing. Knowing this in advance, save a taunt and a bash for the few seconds before the debuff lands, and pound both on the mob right after you see the effect message in your text. A successful taunt check will move you back to a high position on the hate list. <br>
<br>
Instances where a caster is summoned, but not hit at all, are opportunities for the main tank to rocket their hate upward. If you see a message indicating that a mob has been slowed or disjunctioned, you can, if the mob is still attacking you, save a taunt for when that debuffer is almost invariably summoned. Hit your taunt right after the summon, and again, the mob will stick to you like glue for the next few seconds. <br>
<br>
This is a dangerous balance, however, as anyone that puts themselves incredably high above you on the hate list, often have to die before you can regain your position. <br>
<br>
Main tanking takes very little effort on the part of the main tank, and requires incredible attention on the part of those healing. Main tanks must do nothing other than maintain, or try to maintain aggro for as long as possible, or until the end of the fight, whichever is longer *grin*. Twenty seconds is not too long to go, to ensure the mob really does not like you for the entire fight. <br>
<br>
While maintanking, you have a very differant order of importance. <br>
<br>
It is:<br>
<br>
1. You. <br>
<br>
If you die, the mob will not yet have a single other tank that it hates as much as it hated you. It will bounce from target to target, often first killing the casters because they debuffed, before returning to the now defenseless and unsupported melee. Use any tool you have to survive, which isn't many. You have your disciplines. Defensive is your best friend. You will take approximately 40% less damage for three minutes. If ever you know a fight is going to be hard, (ie, you lose the first 25% of your health in 1 second) then use defensive EARLY and do not be afraid to do so, since it is a 7 minute refresh, at level 60. <br>
<br>
If you are *just* about to die, and the cleric is 4 seconds off their complete heal, you should whirl up either your furious or your fortitude disciplines. Both have a 57 minute refresh timer at level 60, so the choice is dependant on the type of mob you are fighting. <br>
<br>
A caster, or an enraged mob, must use fortitute: they will continue to hit you if all you are doing is riposting them, or they will cast on you and kill you. If the mob is pure melee, and is not enraged, your furious discipline will allow you to skyrocket your aggro while surviving for 11 seconds for the complete heal to land. Ripostes are huge huge taunts, almost as much as actually pressing the taunt button. <br>
<br>
A warning for any use of Fortitude: You become invulnerable for 8 seconds. You can still attack and taunt, but you are in a similar state to Devine Aura: That means the mobs are apt to *ignore you* for 8 seconds. That means that they will be looking for other targets. After that 8 seconds, you will be back to being the star of the show, but for that time, they will kill clerics and enchanters and other melee like a scythe through wheat. <br>
<br>
If you *do* use discipline fortitude on a raid to ensure the survival of the person with the most aggro, make sure you have more than one person who can keep you healed after the disc goes down, because whoever was doing it up until you used your disc, is now a bloody smear on the ground. <br>
<br>
2. Healers<br>
<br>
Healers that keep you alive to gather more aggro to keep the mob off the healers and other raiders. Healers are your only means of survival, and without enough of them alive, you die, then everyone dies. Maintain high aggro from early on to late in the fight. <br>
<br>
3. Everyone Else<br>
<br>
These are the people that kill the mobs. You don't, and the healers don't. Everyone else makes sure that you holding aggro is worth something at the end of the day. You can hold aggro for 4 hours, if the mob just can't be killed fast enough, you will eventually have all your healers out of mana, and you all die. <br>
