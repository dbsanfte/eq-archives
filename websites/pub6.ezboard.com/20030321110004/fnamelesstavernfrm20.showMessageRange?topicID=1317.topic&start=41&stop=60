Hey Clark do you make fun of the mentally challenged when you see them? Do you think people with autism and Down Syndrome could actually live &quot;normal&quot; productive lives if they really wanted to? Because that's basically what ou're saying in that statement. On one hand you have Stephen Hawking who suffers from a debilitating disease, and by all account should of died 15 years ago, but some how he persevears (mind over matter and all that jazz). On the other hnd youhave George Bush who, although arguably borderline retarded himself, could actually take speech therapy classes and other stuff so that he could master the English language.<br>

I certainly do not doubt Mr. Chretien's skill as an administrator. And as you say, Mug, you have to admire a person that can remain in power for that length of time. <br>

That still does not address his habit of mangling both English and French speach. His denial that he is a lawyer when he has been one since 1963 is a classic.<br>

I understand that Canadians are proud of their country.  You should be.  I also never said that I didn't want to be Canadian.  I said I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.  My point was that generally, Candadians talk more @#%$ about US than the other way around.  I happen to think your country is beautiful and your reputation is excellent.  I also think that most people I know share the opinion, and just think that you are too quick to criticize when we don't do that to you.  (Again, everyone criticizes politics, big f'ing whoop)  Your post Moneybond, was extremely offensive to me, because of the simple fact that you rant on about guns, racism, intellligence, etc...when in fact you don't live here, you can't appreciate being an American when you aren't one, and I can't appreciate being Canadian when I'm not.  But I still don't disrespect your country, nor the intelligence of your people.<br>
