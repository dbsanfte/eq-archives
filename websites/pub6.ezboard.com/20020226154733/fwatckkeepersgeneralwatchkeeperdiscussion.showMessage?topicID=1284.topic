***********************<br>
<br>
Above is a link to a currently running thread from the shammy boards about Katta faction. <br>
<br>
***********************<br>
<br>
Below is a copy/paste from that same post by Blarg - not me :P  <br>
<br>
The faction hits you get from doing the quests are the big ones. So you have to do the quests. Vamps give faction hits that are too small to matter. <br>
<br>
However, you should kill them like mad, along with sonic wolves, to get the drops you need to raise your faction through quests. Bring a huge number of empty slots, cuz pyrrohitite don't stack. <br>
<br>
You can also try what I'll suggest with shissar organs to repeat the EB necklace quest in katta over and over again to get more faction. <br>
<br>
My iksar friend did the EB necklace quest in katta even though he is KOS, and did it WHILE FIGHTING Drenic Garrison, the mob you hand it in to, because of tricks like this. I handed in my 3 shissar organs to Drenic the same way, though I wasn't KOS enough to have to be fighting him. As a rallos zek ogre though, I wasn't able to get him to respond. <br>
<br>
You hand in your item, then have a bard or druid or whatever friend invis you. DON'T CLICK your &quot;give&quot; button UNTIL YOU ARE INVISED. When invised, your faction changes for the better. Click and you get the faction adjustment and any items they might give you in return. This works cuz I've done it. <br>
<br>
You can also do this by using harmony on the NPC, supposedly, but I haven't tried it myself. <br>
<br>
Collect pyrrohitite samples from the sonic wolves and give them to Berk Thurstone one at a time, the dorf in Katta in the dorf section. Do this until you can do other quests. Give vampire blood to Avir Sternbla on the 3rd floor of the mage building in upstairs katta four at a time until you can do other quest, same thing with ashes. Of course, every time you get more, keep doing this stuff. <br>
<br>
When your faction with validus custodus goes up, see Corporal Kent in the warrior building upstairs. He'll stop telling you to go away and give you a box to fill with shrieking substances and give back to him. When you hit combine, the box is no longer a container and can be stored in one of your other bags. It was my impression that shrieking substances gave pretty good faction hits. <br>
<br>
When your faction is good enough from the pyrrohitite and/or blood and/or ashes, check out the barb guy in the warrior building. Give him vampire fangs 4 at a time. Also seem to be good faction hits from him, is my impression. <br>
<br>
I did pyrrohitite at least 50 times(50 stones), fangs 30-ish times, blood or ashes in total maybe 4 sets of 4, shrieking substances maybe 7 or 8 sets of 8, EB neck quest once. <br>
<br>
Am now amiable to validus custodus. Not sure when I got there, sorry, cuz I don't check often. But it enables me to fix faction more easily, cuz vampire blood and ashes and fangs all stack, and so do shrieking substances. Much easier than filling up with pyrrohitite at 10 eight each, unstackable, and having to run back and forth to dump them on the NPC and getting very tiny faction hits for it. <br>
<br>
The most important thing at first is the pyrrohitite from the wolves, because they are plentiful and have a somewhat reasonable chance of dropping it, and you can do it with really lousy faction. The vampire drops are much more uncommon, and the mobs are either tougher or harder to get as singles, and anyway there are less of them. (The wolves, it sometimes seems you can hardly move before you see another one.) For the less determined and courageous among us, the guy you hand it in to is also in a tougher area to the KOS. <br>
<br>
Anyway, there's a way around faction problems, as I noted above. Unfortunately, it requires a friend to help. <br>
<br>
I very strongly suggest you bring plenty of money and &quot;farm&quot; the katta vendors for pyrrohitite, too -- buy out their supply whenever you see it. Costs 10-13pp depending on faction for a goodie. Most people neither know nor care about turning in pyrrohitite, and 10 weight unstackable is a pain, so they just dump it. It could be buried under other stuff, though, so you might have to do the business where you buy out stuff from the vendor to create an empty slot, then sell him one of your item, etc. <br>
<br>
Yes, yes, a big pain, undoubtedly. Kind of stupid of Verant to make faction bad even on what's basically another planet entirely. <br>
<br>
But that's what you gotta do. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I think none of the faction quests give hits to katta citizen, or maybe only the vamp fangs one does. Anyway, I'm no closer to being able to buy or sell in katta than I ever was, even after all my work. :P But I can quest and talk to many more NPC's now and get a positive response. <br>
<br>
Not all, by a good measure. Some talk to me a bit and then refuse to answer my [questions] to advance quests. Oh well, it's a start. <br>
<br>
By the way, don't even think about trying to get good katta faction and keep seru faction. These cities are enemies, on opposite faction. I think every katta quest I've done gives bad seru faction, and so does some of the vamp killing, if I recall, at least of the nameds perhaps. <br>
<br>
Good luck on it.<br>
<br>
***********************<br>
Below this is a copy/paste from Stonienogg - not me either ;P<br>
<br>
my dark elf cleric of innoruuk has gone from scowls to apprehensive with Validus Custodius, after killing tons of vamps especially named ones. She's turned in 90+ fangs which got her from dub to app, Magus and the leaders still scowl, townsfolk still dubious. <br>
<br>
my ogre shaman of rallos has gone from dubious to everybody to ally to guards, still dubious to Magus, leaders, and townsfolk. This after hundreds of blood and ashes and fangs turned in and even more dead vamps than my cleric. <br>
<br>
It takes days and weeks but i'm sure it can be done. The best way to raise Magus I've seen is killing the 12 Seru guards in mseru. Low hp so they drop within seconds of pet nibbling, and respawn almost as fast as you can run back and forth killing. If you're trying to raise katta without lowering Seru, it's going to take even longer, I say go with one and stick with it.<br>

My cleric was grouped in the T.Leach cave and became amiable with all factions of faction in Seru after one evening and got very nice exp in process. Well all but one, she is still indifferent to Eye of Seru ( they seem to be the most stucked up once).<br>
Since Seru and Katta are on war-path in theory killing in Seru should give nice faction with Katta.<br>
However Seru has some interesting quests also so best bet would be to be friends with both.<br>
<br>
In theory: killing Though Leaches till at least amiable in Seru and then taking a group to Seru (most guards are blue there) and killing there but watching the faction carefully so it doesnt drop too low. Before KoS going back to Lantis to fix it again by killing the Leaches, then back to Seru to work on Katta faction...<br>
<br>
Unfortunately this is just a theory.. I have no idea if it would work yet. But who knows... maybe it's the way to get the best of both worlds...<br>
