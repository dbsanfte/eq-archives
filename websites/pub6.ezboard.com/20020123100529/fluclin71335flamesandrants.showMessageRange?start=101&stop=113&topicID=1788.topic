I'm not talking about a dictionary definition, or dissection of the word.  When you speak of anarchists, the thought that's generally inspired is one of two things:  people who wish to create chaos, or people who wish to take down the established government.<br>
<br>
Chaos would be a fairly distinct lack of unity, although if you're of a really warped turn of thinking I guess you could maybe twist that into being the ultimate kind of unity.  (No, can't provide an example, but surely SOMEONE on this board can wrap their brain around that idea and run with it)  I suppose the effort to create chaos would require unity, although eventually even that unity would have to be destroyed to complete the desire.<br>
<br>
If you're talking about taking down the established government, that requires leadership if you wish to proceed in any manner that has a hope of reasonably succeeding.  Leadership is contrary to anarchy, as you yourself pointed out.<br>
<br>
Is there something I've missed there?  Not being a smartass, I'm serious.  It's rare that someone actually discusses something vaguely logical on this board.<br>

<br>
It's only through unity that anarchy would work. There's nothing wrong with leaders - if you take a group of people and give them a problem to solve, one or more of those people may see a solution first that is agreeable to the others. They may have to demonstrate thier solution, instruct the others, and indeed take a lead in getting the ball rolling.<br>
<br>
However, once the problem has been solved (or at least eveyone is aware of the solution and is working towards it) the &quot;leader&quot; returns to being a normal member of the group. <br>
<br>
A new problem arises, a new leader may be found. If someone gets a name for themselves as being a quick thinker, a visionary, a solver of problems, then you will probably find that that person is looked upon first for answers. As long as the rest of the group doesn't get lazy and just starts following said person blindly (which I think is where anarchy will fail) you'll have a community where no-one person is an overall leader - just a group which has people with &quot;specialist subjects&quot;.<br>
<br>
I personally believe that anarchy is a wonderful idea; I also believe mankind is too entrenched to consider anything that radical.  <p><font size="+1">

No matter how much we wished the world could survive with complete class equality it will never happen.<br>
Human nature would not allow for Anarchy in any form or for equality.<br>
It is a simple basic truth there will always be a ruleing class.<br>
there will never be a utopian society and it is all due to human nature. Humans in general can not live in chaos they have a need to controll every situation.<br>
No matter how hard you try to debate it or how many times some scholar thinks he has found the perfect idea for humanity human nature will always ruin it.<br>
I am sure someone could explain this better.<br>
On the political correctness discussion.<br>
Politcal correctness I think comes from the fact that people take things way to serously. There is no way to get rid of it because there will always be that person offended by it who will cry foul and preach against it. There is nothing we can do about any of these things really It is human nature at work.<br>
All these things will just build up till humanity gets tired of them. Then it will crumble and happen again later in a continous cycle.<br>
I wished I was better at explaining these Observations but I am not I hope you get the jest of it.<br>
For both of these ideas you would have to convince a whole civalization that they were wrong.<br>

Anarchists themselves are either too dumb or too smart for their own good.  The smart ones resent anyones leadership but their own and will refuse to follow it.  The dumb ones just plain don't like being told what to do.<br>

Either way, anytime a leader would show up in an anarchists' society, he would get about a thousand DocMarten imprints about his head and ass.<br>

However, communism does not = anarchy.  Anarchy stood for the total disruption of all society, for chaos to engulf the nations for a very very long time.  It's only recently that this peaceful form of anarchy has started becoming trendy.  At the point that anarchy becomes peaceful, it stops becoming anarchy, because at that point it is ordered.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I'm not talking about dictionary terms, or dissected words.  I'm talking about what the concept of anarchy is to probably 90+% of people that you meet.  They don't think of an ordered society.  They don't think of a peaceful community in which everything is done by spontaneous committee.  They think of chaos, the lack of order.  So tell me, where did your description of an anarchistic society come from, other than Karl Marx's theories of an ideal communistic society?<br>

It's been reinforced by sites like the aforementioned. Blowing up government buildings is one thing, having a viable replacement system  afterwards is another.<br>
<br>
(Quick note. I do not approve of blowing up government buildings. Mindless slaughter of innocents is NOT what my interpretation of anarchy is about.)<br>
<br>
I've not read Marx or Lenin, but my understanding of pure communism, a single level community, sounds anarchic to me; if it is, whoohoo, paint my butt red and call me a communist ;-) I guess I have a lot of reading to do; perhaps anarchy is a prerequistite for communism, instead of an alternative.<br>
<br>
Whilst having a poke around, I found a comment that in world politics, there is no central world government, so for the purpose of illustration, world politics is anarchic. However, since the world is not in chaos (i.e. not in a constant state of war) there must be some form of order, albeit without a hiearchy. <br>
<br>
The fact that yes, probably 90%+ of the population does regards anarchy as chaos, is the main stumbling block against it ever taking off. Pretty much shows the level of success that governments have in maintaining the intended view :-)<br>
<br>
<br>
Lol, at least a large majority of people would also find &quot;Anarchists Unite!&quot; amusing too :-) <p><font size="+1">
