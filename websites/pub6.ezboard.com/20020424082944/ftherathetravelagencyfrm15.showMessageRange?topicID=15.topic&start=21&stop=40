<br>
First off let me commend you for proving one point.  Rude gets you nowhere.<br>
<br>
Look, you say post an alternative.  I did that and it got absolutely nowhere.  All I want is for EVERYONE to be equal.  I do not think the BB rule is fair because I think they have enough equipment and shouldn't be called in at all.  <br>
<br>
I also think 40 is a very high number.  I would be willing to work on a calender but not one that doesn't include everyone.  There is nothing on your calender currently for those that are not in a guild to post.  40 people for those that are guildless is a lot of people.  And the planes does not take 40+ people to clear.<br>
<br>
As to the threats it is wrong on both sides.  I think that discussion is an excellent way to get things out but making an obvious threat is wrong.<br>
<br>
And Grundall if you had said to me in game what you said to him on this thread you would definitely see the power of verant.  It was not only rude, childish, uncalled for, and wrong but it was plain stupid.  If you can't come up with something intelligent or better to say then as the old saying goes &quot;if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.&quot;<br>

evidently your not inteligent enough to understand,<br>
i am going to the planes! <br>
<br>
i want the idiot that said even a moron wouldnt post he was gona train someone to point me to where i said train. boy is he a moron<br>
<br>
like i said im going to the planes and do not need your approval.<br>
<br>
if you get trained not my fault, im going to see whats there and gona learn the zone no matter how many levels it takes, THATS MY RIGHT AND WHAT I PAID FOR!<br>
<br>
if you think it is right to enforce this calendar on everyone .. it is also your duty to show .. not tell .. why it is right and if i have to go to the planes solo to find out .. i would suggest that whoever is there vacate untill i learn what is going on!<br>
<br>
other wise quote grundells words <br>
<br>
jamany discussion only works when both side talk and listen .. the calendar people are not listing but when you hear we are tired of explaining because all that come here ask the same things.. does it not prove that there are many who think its not right ..<br>
<br>
btw i have many friends in your guilds ask around .. and alot of them do not like the calendar for various reasons .. but ill tell ya what .. they dislike the new rules more then ya know.<br>
<br>
if due to the size of the server you could only go once every two month .. so what .. at least everyone could go .. but your not happy with fair .. all i hear here is the people that set store in &quot;look at me i have this or i have that&quot; i wear a foremans tunic and carry a mace and am quite happy i can do the same as you and enjoy my self .. i am not driven by an insatiable lust to be better then every one else and tell them so, or to be dressed in the greatest armor .. all it does is show ya as greedy people and yup thats what i dont like about you all .. no matter who says what, at this stage if ya want free for all stop listening and carry on <br>
once more the choice is yours .. i will do what I think is right .. not what you do<br>
<br>
but i am gona learn the planes, with or without your aproval<br>

Almost all of the members of the guild are, by inclination, lone wolfs in game. It was that that led me to finally guild myself at lvl 45 on my third toon, after being on since day one. So as to how I feel about Clept's postings here? Last time I checked he had the right to say as he pleases, express his views. Now earlier in this thread someone made the statement that he intended to cause trains in the planes, cause he was willing to die and wear old clothes, not so. He would wear the old clothes so as not to loose the fine gear he has now, as to dying there? How exactly do think the planes were first mastered? <br>

Don't even know why I'm still perusing this thread, but a couple of quick points about the guild name:<br>
<br>
1. It's misspelled.  Yes, I've seen it in game and it's misspelled there, too.  It should be &quot;Lone Wolves of Norrath&quot;.  &quot;Wolves&quot; is the plural of &quot;Wolf&quot;; &quot;Wolfs&quot; only exists as a verb; example:  &quot;Clept wolfs down his food too quickly&quot;.<br>
<br>
2. &quot;Lone Wolves&quot; don't group together; the guild name is completely contradictory... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have been the one calling for a complete threat halt on both sides.  All I said was if you were to say that to me in game, yes, a gm would have been sent a report.  It is rude and uncalled for and being a lady, yes a lady, I do not like that language.  Especially coming from someone who does not know me at all.<br>
<br>
That was not a threat.  That was a promise made that verant themselves stand behind.  Rude behaviour should never be accepted by anyone.  And that kind of talk just turns people away.<br>
