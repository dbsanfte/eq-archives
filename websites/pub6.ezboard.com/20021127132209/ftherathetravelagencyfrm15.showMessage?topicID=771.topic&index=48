<br>
This arguement isn't even worth having in my opinion.  The same thing happened to me the other day.  Me and 5 other people from various mid-game guilds were hunting in ME for experience at the Umbral Plains zone.  League of Levity came burning through to...I dunno...I assume they were killing Rumblecrush.<br>
<br>
The 6 of us saw LoL people begin to file though, and realizing that they are a quite large guild, we understood that we would be constanly trained for about 15 minuted while they all got their way to UP.  I would say we were trained 8-10 times, most with the mobs right there nerar the UP zone.<br>
<br>
We positioned ourselves in a manner to avoid the trains while still fighting, and when LoL had moved in completely, we resumed hunting at our normal spot.  We understood that a large number of people needed to file through, and that trains were going to happen, and we did not feel that the members of LoL did anything wrong.  We made way for them as to make things go as smoothly as possible for both parties.<br>
<br>
There has been this huge wave of people spewing forth excess melodramatic bullshit lately.  Grow up.<br>

<br>
How about you do the same thing we all learned back in Crushbone or Blackburrow, and assume the zoneline has people nearby, camping it or not?  That is just as sad an excuse and rationalization as Thundax's bullshit excuse about &quot;don't camp where I'm running&quot;.  Why?  Because it IS the same excuse.  If you are going to train a zone, ANY zone, call it.  Period.  Assume there might, just maybe, be someone there.  Why?  Because there probably is.  And if not, what have you lost?  All of 3 seconds hitting your Train hotkey in your 5th set of 100 hotkeys you can have?  Because if you don't call it, and there IS someone there, you look like the asshole, not them.<br>
<br>
Following the wall nets you no see invis mobs.  COH works in ME.  Invis and hugging the zone wall works in ME and results in a hell of a lower chance than just barreling up the middle.  Just because you have 40 people going to a raid doesn't mean you get to be a prick about it and blame people for &quot;camping on the freeway&quot;.  Show some consideration and hug a wall, it's not hard.<br>
<br>
To recap:<br>
There shouldn't have been a train if the people moving through followed high on the zone wall invis (hell even without invis you'd be incredibly lucky if you manage to pick up a mob, much less several).<br>
<br>
Even when there was a train, it should have been called, regardless of whether you &quot;think&quot; the zoneline is camped or not.  That is EQ 1-OH-fucking-1.<br>
<br>
If you trained them, and didn't call it, the LEAST you can do is res them, and then apologize, instead of being an ass and blame them for &quot;camping in the wrong spot&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhutterr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hutterr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/15/02 6:26:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=771.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Trains</span><hr size=1> Let me clarify again. This isnt a problem JUST in ME. It happens in LOTS of zones. I TOTALLY understand the risks of camping a zoneline (which I dont do BTW, but thats not the point) because as nycah said, shit can happen for all kinds of reasons. When it does, we all jsut have to deal with it.<br>
<br>
My PROBLEM is that this isnt the case most of the time. Almost ALL of the trains to zonelines are ONLY because people are too inconsiderate to get an invis. You tried to use the &quot;its your fault&quot; shit on me again, and its NOT. If you can honestly say that I am being inconsiderate for setting up a camp ANYWHERE with a strait face, I applaude your ability to completely ignore reality. <br>
<br>
My camp poses ZERO threat to you. In fact, theoretically, it ENCOURAGES you to be safer than you all seem to want to be. If you invised, you would simply be safer than just running, period. <br>
<br>
Your train however, poses SERIOUS threat to anyone even remotely close to a zoneline or any area in your general path...but IM inconsiderate.<br>
<br>
For those that need a recap:<br>
<br>
1) Trains DO happen despite precautions<br>
2) Trains can be minimized if those travelling use a little (un)common sense and (un)common courtesy and actually take the time and effort to use those precautions.<br>
3) No matter WHAT, a trainer CANNOT reasonably argue that a train is the TRAINEES fault. By definition thats not possible.<br>

<br>
Hutterr and some others seem to have taken that from my post that I train people all the time and don't bother looking out for other people.<br>
<br>
I use invisi everywhere. I spent aa points on Innate Camo so that I have instant click invisible. It is unusual for me to run through any zone without invisi, even if the mobs are too low to attack me.<br>
<br>
If there is a zone wall to follow to make it safer, I follow it. I am 100 percent in agreement that people should try to avoid causing trains.<br>
<br>
If my guild is moving to a zone for a raid, and there is a train and some people get killed, I personally see that they are CRed and ressed safely. <br>
<br>
In the very rare event that I cause a train, I will call it. Again there is no reason not to.<br>
<br>
The point of my previous post was that trains will always happen to zone lines, and sometimes those trains will not be called. I guess if you really want to camp at a zoneline, it is your business, but what I said before is that you then can't really complain if you get trained. I have been playing for 3 and a half years, and from Crushbone to Ssra Temple, there are trains.<br>
<br>
Karadin posted about the various ways to lessen the chances of causing a train, and I agree with him. In most zones it is fairly simple to avoid causing a train. Probably the hardest one is running to Ssra Temple through The Grey. The large number of traps with see invisi mobs means there is a good chance you will get seen by something.<br>
<br>
No matter how easy it is to not train, sometimes there will still be trains, and those trains will mostly end up at zonelines.<br>
<br>
If you think that maybe one out of 10-20 people running to Akheva from DSP will bring a train, then when you consider a raid of 50 people running there, it can surely not be surprising when there are a few trains. Also, some mobs in ME do see invisi. Once there is an initial train, it is highly likely that plenty of other people will run into that same see invisi mob as it is leaving the Akheva area. Even if the person had taken every step possible to avoid training such as getting an invisi and following the wall, once they get near the Akheva building they will probably still agro the see invisi mob that is leaving the area and cause a train that way.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am sure someone will read this and take one point out of context and flame me for it again. I hope you have fun.<br>

<br>
You ARE right that trains will happen despite the precautions, and its generally not advisable to camp zonelines, and I dont promote that. I have had SO many people argue the point that they dont need to invis, cause if you camp the zoneline, youre an idiot and should expect it.<br>
<br>
Thats the attitude I dont like and simply refuse to tolerate. You obviously dont feel that way and I may have tried to read into your original post jsut what I wanted to see.<br>
<br>
I think my points however are still valid and truly hope that everyone at least makes the effort to avoid the trains, call them when they cant avoid them, and offer some compassion (or even help) when they train. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen
