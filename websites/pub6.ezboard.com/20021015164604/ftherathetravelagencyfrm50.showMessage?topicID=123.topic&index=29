<br>
ikitiar and eashan are not as hard as otehr mobs in tovn, but they do drop desired loot (at least 1 or 2 per).<br>
<br>
The whole point of rotations is you give, and you take:<br>
<br>
I give up 2 avatar of war kills, to ensure i will always get one (every 3rd spawn) if i want it.  I give up 2/3 of the xerkish spawns in sra, i give up 1/2 of the hp spawns, 1/2 of the blood spawns, 1/5th of the dozekar spawns, 1/x of etc etc etc...I trade smaller loot intake to my guild for order.  I sacrifice, but in exchange i know that if i want to, i can kill any mob in the game, regularly (depending on # of rotation member).  <br>
<br>
Most rotations are mob based, because they are clear cut cases of: kill this mob, loot it, grats... there are also instance of other situations. For instance:<br>
<br>
Plane of fear: it probably has 350 mobs in it. Do we put each mob on rotation?  HAH no!... we put the zone on rotation (and separately the god, because the zone pops every 12h, the god every 7d.  ToV is basically 3 zones, all connected.<br>
<br>
ToVwest (the 3 dragons), HoT, and ToVnorth.  It has been decided from the very first inception of rotation, that once you were admitted to the rotation, you had all 15 (ikky, eash, arry, felsh, dagarn, kriezen, mirelenna, koi, vyemm, zlex, cek, sev, nev, jor, vulak (until removed)) protected for 48hours.  Your 'passage' to this protection is by killing arrynar (because you basically can only kill 2/15 of tov until you kill him... after this, in all likelyhood you can steamroll the rest.  <br>
<br>
If people take it upon themselves to snipe the front 2, for loot or whatever reason, then they again are sitting on the fence:  if you can kill ikky/eash, in all likelyhood you can kill king t, statue, dain, zlandicar.  So, under this sccenario, you are using double standards with the rotation, that is: you enjoy the safety of having mobs protected for you, uncontested and then 'rebel' against the rotations when it doesnt suit your needs/wants.  <br>
<br>
If people begin to snipe ikky/each, then he will in effect go FFA, which will, in effect remove him from existence in the game (trust me).  So, this is where you 'give' - you exercise discipline, and avoid sniping ikky/eash (unless you have genuine intent to try arry, win or loose - if you are genuinely making an effort to enter the rotation, you are in the right here), and meet the prereqisites to enter the tovN rot, from there, you too will enjoy a GUARANTEED shot/kill/loot of ikky/eash/ and beyond every X weeks until this game goes out of business, or you move on.<br>
<br>
Is it that hard to understand?? <p><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Emil">Emil Sinclair</a><br>

<br>
Yea I understand, if you snipe those 2 dragons the whole rathe with give you the fat one.  Yes I understand the concept of rotational mobs...as was stated before.  I also understand that FFA is bad, see mes be edjumicated =). <br>
<br>
Well I have a suggestion then since all FFA is bad.  I can handle killing Lodi but I am never guaranteed a shot at him, @#%$ I can never beat the wizards there,  so can you guarantee me a shot at him?  Since I have had the patience to make sure that I could do him?  No Lodi is a FFA mob...so is Vindi, since there are FFA mobs why can not 2 more be added to that list?  These 2 dragons are involved in NO quest and can easily be seperated from NToV.  <br>
<br>
<br>
All I asked about was 2 dragons being moved to the FFA list....and if that would be possible.   If not explain why, please don't be condensending and rude.   Ohh thats right I forgot that ALL mobs that drop decent loot are protected by the RTA.   Emil you talked about double standards and how I would only be killing this to suit my needs/wants.   Who has the double standards here?  EVERY mob isnt covered by the rotation it would be crazy if they were.  I agree there is a reason for rotational mobs, there is also a reason for FFA mobs.  I see no cause to attack me like that and infer that I am stupid. <br>
<br>
On a lighter side I really don't see people or guilds going there with one of their purposes of making PP off the rot drops or selling tradable decent items, ie Lodi shields. <p><center><BR><font color= Blue><BR><i>Granitfist/Jeribu<i/><BR><i>GrandMaster/High Priest<i/><BR><i>Co-Leader of Circles End<i/><BR><i>The Rathe<BR><center><i><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370733">The Monk </> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370756">The Cleric<i/>

<br>
The reason why they are FCFS is that the guilds who were on rotation agreed to drop the rotation OR the guilds who were capable (having already done so) agreed to continue to leave those mobs on FCFS status.<br>
<br>
As the only guilds who currently are able to (and do) kill Ikatair/Eashen are on the ToVN rotation list and they have stated that they wish them to remain on the rotation, they should remain on the rotation.  At such a time as there are others who do kill these mobs, the issue is moot. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 9/16/02 7:00:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugranitfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Granitfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 10:59:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> Ok I made a mistake when I said FFA, I should have said FCFS.

<br>
they are simply 'too easy' to kill (ie: they dont require a guild effort). a side effect of this, is that it is virtually impossible to 'police' those who kill them at will. in addition, imagine the # of applications for rotation, hehe..<br>
<br>
I agree, mobs like gor should be on rot, if requested, but frankly i expect nothing from complications from it, as he is easily 1 grouped (by wiz/necros - who dont even need to be in a guild, thus there would be no tangible discipline/warnings to issue them)<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Basically it isnt the RTA who decides everything like that for the rathe but BoTS, Tindi and NB leadership? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The rules of rotations are decided by the guilds on the rotations.  If you want to know the rotation agreement on Arch Lich, talk to NB, Tindi, or BotS... not RTA.  If you want to know the rotation agreement on Trakanon, talk to NB, LoL, TL, VoF, CoN, ED, VoLS, FS, FK, EotF, LoM, and S4H.  For Zlandicar, talk to NB, LoL, VoF, FK, TL, HE, CB, LoM, CoN, and SoY.  For other mobs, look at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.jakefitch.com/rta/Rotations.asp">www.jakefitch.com/rta/Rotations.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> which is where I cut and pasted those lists from.  The RTA is a collection of committees I guess...  not a single committee.<br>
<br>
I can tell you a lot of the original agreements on mobs but I couldn't tell you the latest agreements on several (like Trakanon or Severilous or Zlandicar) because we aren't active participants of those rotations anymore.  They may have changed the rules since we were in those rotations. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 9/16/02 7:19:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugranitfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Granitfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 11:21:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=36>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ToVN Rotation agreement/rules</span><hr size=1> Nyca as all know CE is not even close to being able to try these mobs.  The reason I took my stance on this was because it was brought up and now seemed like the best time to address this.  In a month or 2 CE might be able to do these 2 mobs, other guilds are ready now.<br>
<br>
I took this stand because I truelly felt that it was unfair that the 3 votes that decide this all come from guilds who can steam roll NToV.  At 100 active people for each guild this amounts to not even a tenth of the Rathe.  Of course they are going to look out for their better interests, but what about the other 90 percent of the Rathe.  Those mobs are very hard for any guild other than the big 3, but to straight up say...no pissoff you can not even try or attempt them, you can not fight them, you can't even look at them or we will say that you are sniping them.  <br>
<br>
Most guilds won't even attempt them, some will but how can you seriously justify telling others that they cant even try???  Why play a game?  For the challenge or to get the best equipment possible regardless of the cost or to be with friends?  I play for the challenge of mobs and my friends, all I was asking is why can't they be moved to fcfs?  I was told my answer, the leaders of Tindi, BoTs and NB have decided that THEY, not the people of the rathe make that choice and THEY said no.

No one has ever said &quot;you can't try&quot;.  All that is said is that Iki and Eashan are part of the NToV Rotation.  All the guilds that have gotten onto that Rotation know that, and have accepted it.<br>
