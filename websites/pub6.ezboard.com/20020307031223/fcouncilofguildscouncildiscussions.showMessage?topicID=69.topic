This weekend found ourselves in Oasis.  *shuddder*  This got me thinking.<br>
<br>
I met a number of newbies who were real newbies.  True, they were kinda twinked from friends or guildmates, but they were still on their first character and did not know a lot about the game.  They had never heard of Shattering Steel or KCoG or Grey Hawke or Alm.  They were all too busy training spec's to the dock and waiting for something interesting to happen.<br>
<br>
Now then, I just posted to lead a raid on SG and/or DN later this week.  Great.  That will help us and be fun.  But what about the low level characters?  I know Haemish is going to try to run a raid on Neriak later this month.  What about everyone else?  KCoG has helped a lot of people of the last year or so.  Many of you have gone on to other guilds and encounters.  But still you got first starts here.  Which is great, and what KCoG is all about.   Now I'm asking everyone who has benefited from KCoG to think beyond their guilds for a bit.  To run some lowbie events.  Do some follow up raids on Befallen and Kithikor.  Slap those evil undead in LFay.  Make a real event of it by shouting it out in ajoining zones.  Do first aid stations in Oasis and WC.  Some or any or even other ideas.<br>
<br>
I'm worried that Shattering Steel might have a point.  That we are getting to wrapped up in the big targets and raids.  I know in the past I've advocated them because large targets and raids are pretty much all there is post 50.  That's still true.  But if we are to win over the portion of the server who hasnt even heard of KGC, KCoG, or even the fact that the planes require you to be 46, then we need to show them why the rotation is important.  Not by harrasssing and boycotting and yelling at SS.  But by running events and including everyone from the server.  Show the undecided and those who dont know whats going on that the game is fun and not just raiding for the crazy phat lewt.<br>
<br>
Haemish, if you read this I'd like to get in touch with you sometime about working with SB or SD to set some or all of this up soon.  I know I can take sometime out of my schedule to help those.  I cant help many people who helped me, they've moved on.  But I can at least try to help those who are still coming up.  If any other guild leaders or officers would like to talk to me about this, I'll be on or just post something here and I'll get in touch.  I know some guilds do run events, but we really need to promote things more.<br>

Never heard of Vox, never heard of Naggy, never heard of Planes, run like heck to a zone everytime someone shouted 'spectres' (tho I hadn't a clue what one was), had just me a drunk named Destava in NRO who changed the game for me, learned how to swim from NRO to Oasis, grouped with my first Barbarian and flipped his kilt (his name was Bearog), and the list goes on...........<br>

This is a spot I tend to go back to, and just sit and buff up the newbies.  There is nothing more satisfying in the game, than meeting a true newbie and helping them out by answering their in game questions.<br>

The meetings gave the council a bigger in game presance rather than just an out of game one. When I was level 20 I attended my first meeting and it was this that lead me to start my research into the game.<br>

<br>
Guilds have every right to exclude whoever they want from guild membership. There are tons of guilds on this server, if you don't fit the requirements for some, you move to another. Sounds to me like you are advocating people to just let anyone into their guild. That kind of thing leads to in fighting, and guilds dissolving. <br>
<br>
As for lower level events, the Sacred Band ran a Lake of Ill Omen overwatch not too long ago. I'm firmly behind any type of event that doesn't exclude by levels. I have asked and begged and pleaded with people other than myself to run these events, and it's been a slow trickle of events. My own time has been so busy lately with my own alliance that I haven't had a chance to hold a meeting or any other type of event. My Neriak raid is a start in that direction, though I personally wish other people would run more things such as that. The tools are there. <br>
<br>
The meetings have been my fault. Both times I've tried to hold a meeting in the last 3 or 4 months, I've been sidetracked and unable to do so (I think both times by an untimely Vox spawn - she really hates me now! LOL) That shouldn't exclude others from getting their own CoG meetings together to discuss some events they'd like to run. Again, the tools are there. <br>
<br>

What I see is that you want every guild on the server to simply allow anyone who wants to join in regardless of if they even want them or not?  If that is true, what is the point of having guilds in the first place?  All guilds have restrictions of some sort or another.  At the high end game, yes levels are part of that.  But I'm not sure if you understand the reasoning behind things like level restriction.<br>
<br>
ToV.  Many of the large uber guilds tend to live there.  However, until you are about level55 and have resistances to magic, cold, and fire, above 150 its pretty pointless to go.  All that will happen is you'll spend your time dirt napping waiting for a rez.  These guilds want people that can help them, not just suck up resources.  Now then, is this the only reason for level restrictions?  Of course not.  I'm sure there's some elitism involved, but thats normal.  As for Alm's no Americans, well I for one dont speak French and if there is a French guild out there that doesnt want to speak English fine.  And even if there is some other reason, I really could care less what their motivations are.<br>
<br>
And for level restrictions, perhaps you should actually make friends with people in those guilds.  They are not as hard and fast as you seem to believe.  Valoran for example is pretty much 55+, and yet Lag and Flarren were able to apply and be accepted at 51.  Exceptions can be made based on friendship, need, or any other combination of factors.  Just wanting in for the phat uber loot, however, is not a reason for them to allow anyone into their guild.<br>
<br>
And finally, exactly what do you mean the guilds that control the rotation?  No guild controls anything.  Whomever is running the raid for said guild or alliance just goes to KGC and asks for a day.  There's no conspiracy, kickbacks, or plat changing hands here.  Hell, you dont even need to be in a guild.  I just requests and was granted access to help run KCoG plane raids and have requested a day for Hate.  I'm not even in a guild.  No one controls access to anything Exsodus.<br>
<br>
I really do not understand your view on this at all Exsodus.  If you choose not to respond again, that is your choice of course.  However, dont be surprised if no one listens to you and simply flames.  Without dialog there is nothing to base any sort of decision on and so people will just go off the deep end.<br>

<br>
I believe you are confusing KGC with the guilds that make it up.  As I said before no one controls the KGC, none of the guilds that are on the rotation control it.  The scheduling is done by Skrim who is a member of The Haven which is a member of the Alliance of Valient Blades.  They are not an uber guild, although they do have fairly strict recruiting policies.  My friend was accepted to The Haven at about level 45 or so.<br>
<br>
However, each guild that makes up the KGC has its own membership requirements.  Some are high like SF, Val, and GH.  Some are lower.  For example the Silver Daggers are part of the Sacred Band.  I'm pretty sure they are part of KGC and yet I dont think they have a level 55+ requirement.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Uber&quot; guilds control nothing.  If it seems like they do it is only because they are the only ones able to take on these targets.  If you can prove your guild/alliance/group of friends you dont know from Adam could take any target then you too could request a slot.  The only reason why anyone needs to &quot;prove&quot; they can handle a target is to keep wasted time to a minimum.  If you cannot handle a target you are removed for a short period of time from the rotation while you rethink your strategy.  After a couple of weeks you can request to be added back in.  That simple.  Yeah, it sucks if you get removed, but KGC exists to share the spawns and if people keep failing by overextending themselves then the spawns are wasted.  And waste is something I understood SS was against.  It is efficent if not the most fair way of doing things.  But it is an imperfect world and we need to strive to find solutions to fit it.<br>

Correct me if I am wrong but doesn't SS (your guild) have a minimum level requirement of 40?<br>
<br>
As for level 1 people joining guilds like SF thats just never gonna happen it isn't practical at all and you know it. All uber guilds have level resrictions it is how you keep an uber guild uber. However my guild and alliance is part of the KGC and we recruit members that are over level 15. The reson for doing this is that by 15 most people have decided to keep their characters and won't just delete them on a whim. We go to the planes and we are on the dragon rotations. We have no restrictions about where you come from. So what is your problem with my guild because if you have a problem with the members of the KGC then you have a problem with us. <p><br><img src=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/chris.thackray/Sigfile2.gif WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=100>

And I think I understand what he's talking about.  Basiclly he has several 50+ characters all of them tanks.  He applied to several of the large guilds which turned him down either by changing the membership requirements or simply saying he's too low.  He also stated that he is not interested in joining a smaller or medium sized guild but only a large one.  His joining SS is because, and I assume here, because they agree with him.<br>
<br>
There are other reason involved as well.  The fact he believes KGC is controled by the larger guilds who first formed them and that they make up all the rules.  I'm sure there are many other reasons involved and I did not log my conversation with him for the same reason I did not take any weapons with me.  It just didnt seem to be the civilized thing to do.<br>
<br>
I also stated our points that KGC is not a conspiracy, but I dont think he believed me.  My take on it was that he, and others in SS, believe that those of us who dont see it are either blind to the facts, dont want to see them, or just are too low to understand.  Nor did I get a reason why he feels that the large guilds need to accept him other than it is not fair and they cant claim the rotations are open to all if they dont accept him. <br>
<br>
Now from talking to him I cant help but wonder if he really distingushes the large guilds or any guild in KGC from KGC itself.  He seems to believe it is just a large alliance rather than a message board.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong in parts of this, as I said I did not log it.  If so, please feel free to correct me Exsodus, it is not my intent to give any falsehoods or flame here, but to help clarify things.  I dont see how, at this point, any real understanding can be reached with Shattering Steel.  The members that remain that I've talked to all see to be operating from a different set of assumptions than everyone else.  I just hope that we can come to some sort of understanding eventually.  But I doubt that I will have any say in it since I have apparently been labeled a flamer by the leadership of SS.  Be that as it may, hopefully this clears something up to someone.<br>

<br>
If you have NO level limits in your guild (such as my guild, the Silver DAGGERS, not Blades Kellory ;p LOL) you will run into one problem. Those levels that make up the majority of the guild (i.e. if you are mostly 40th level + or below 30th level), some members in the guild will feel left out. The 15th level warrior can't hunt with the 55th level enchanter. The planes raids for the 46+ groups CAN'T include the people in their 20's. Often, the people who RUN events and hunts for a guild do so for people within 15-20 levels of themselves, mostly within 10 levels. Other than powerleveling or twinking, or things that DON'T involve hunting or item gathering can't involve people at different ends of the spectrum. And as a result, those who level slower than others will feel left out and alone in a room full of people. If your guild ONLY allows those 40 and above, this problem goes away. The higher the level limit, the less problem with this you have. As the leader of a guild with no level limits and almost 100 people in it, I have seen this problem first hand. It ain't pretty, and it can create some real bitterness on both sides of the spectrum. <br>
<br>
As for thinking that ALL guilds should have NO restrictions on who joins their guilds, what the hell do we have guilds for? A guild is nothing more than a collection of friends who believe in very similar paths in EQ. Shadowed Fates is a VERY different guild from the Silver Daggers, and while I'm sure there are members that would fit in EITHER guild, I know as the leader of my guild, I wouldn't fit in with Shadowed Fates. It's just not my type of place, and my personality would not fit in. Does that make me a bad guild member? I hope not. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  NO guild can be everything to everybody. What you are looking for in a guild is not what I'm looking for in a guild. Kellory is not in a guild because he hasn't found one that fits him. <br>
<br>
I do not get the rest of your post about the leaders of KGC guildremoving themselves. What for? They formed guilds for a reason, why would they leave them? <br>
<br>
One last time, repeat after me: THE KARANA GUILD CENTRAL IS NOT AN ALLIANCE, A GUILD, OR A LARGE CONSPIRACY. IT IS A MESSAGE BOARD THAT WE USE TO SHARE THE PLANES, DRAGONS AND OTHER LARGE TARGETS SO THAT EVERYONE GETS A FAIR SHARE. ASK TO JOIN AND AGREE TO RESPECT THE ROTATIONS AND YOU TOO CAN SCHEDULE A PLANE RAID LIKE ALL THE OTHER GUILDS OR ALLIANCES. <br>
<br>
Sorry for the all caps, but at this point, I think shouting is the only way to get through. Exsodus and the rest of the server do not appear to be talking the same language. <br>

Its late and one of my best friends was in the Silver Daggers before they moved on to TT.  *Sigh*  I so close to going with them, although I think I'm glad I stayed.<br>
<br>
Exsodus's remarks to the guildremove thing was confusing.  As best as I can tell after talking to him it was in reference to his complain about not getting into a large guild.  Basiclly he wanted into a large guild, but they rejected him.  I dont know the specifics, and they dont matter.  Bottom line is, he was rejected.  Hence by his thinking he no longer has true access to rotational targets since he does not want to join a smaller guild.  Everyone has been saying that KGC and the rotation is open and that CoG exists if you are not part of a large guild/alliance.  His point is if CoG works so well that the leaders and officers of the large guilds should remove themselves from their own guilds and join up with CoG to see how well it works.  Basiclly he doesnt feel that CoG works.  Period.  In his words CoG raids fail 100 percent of the time.  He also stated that he has been part of several CoG plane raids that failed and that he had several corpses that didnt get a rez because of a failure, and that SF had to bail CoG out at least once.  Now, personally, I have no clue what he's talking about since he obviously has not been attending teh same CoG raids I have.  Yeah, we sometimes get unrezable corpses if the break goes bad, but to my knowlage CoG has only failed once to break a plane.  His whole guildremove thing is to prove to them CoG is not the same as a large guild.  <br>
<br>
Of course CoG isnt very efficent and so he'd have a better chance at good loot in a large guild.  Which I think is why he's really upset.  Obviously the leaders of the large guilds know CoG's limitations.  But he has limited his own options and is holding everyone else responsible for that.  From what he said, I think he does know that KGC is just the message board, but he believes that the people (Skrim) who make the rotations are biased towards the uber guilds that first started it and that everyone else is left with the scraps.  When I told him that of course because its an imperfect system occasionally one gets screwed one week, but generally its made up to you later.  His reply was that who are they to screw anyone anytime?  His belief is that he is being screwed by others so that they can maintain their posistion.  Its the same arguments used by many minority hate groups to justify themselves.  <br>
<br>
They just dont get it Haemish.  Bottom line.  Either they dont want to or they refuse to.  The reasons and the rational behind it are irrelevent at this point I think.  They have no intention of talking to us about cooperating until we are ready to give in to them.  I hope I'm mistaken in this, but from what I've heard I dont think so.  After all, these are the people who have branded me a flamer, which I dont think I have done really.  Oh well, its late, I'm tired of this whole crap, and I've got a plane raid to plane and somehow scrape up the cash to run it with.  Oh well, if I get screwed by SS they'll probably just figure I had it coming and that as a druid I can just go pharm something to get the cash back quick enough.  If they only knew...<br>

I'm sorry if this didnt make a lot of sense, its late and I'm tired and my head hurts from talking to them and others all day.  I dont appear to hold any kind of authority to them, so its up to others I suppose to talk to them and try to work something out.  Sorry folks, I tried.<br>

Actually I think I do know why... it's so that they don't need to consider that their own actions or personality might have anything to do with why people don't like them.<br>
<br>
These kinds of people, from my experience, tend to be bitter and obstinate.  They will tend to write off anything you say if you ever disagree with them or try to bring up a point that doesn't fit nicely into their view of the world.  They are, in short, the kind of people that start (and/or join) suicide cults.<br>

The cynic in me would really like to poll the members of SS on a few things:<br>
<br>
1) Do you believe: (please check all that apply)<br>
[ ] in UFO's<br>
[ ] in alien kidnappings<br>
[ ] that the US government has been testing extra-terrestrial technology in the military base known to some as &quot;Area 51&quot;<br>
[ ] the CIA has hidden cameras and microphones in your house (NO!  Not there you idiot!  That's the first place anyone looks!  No no no... check the light fixtures...  nothing?  hmm... try the smoke detector... yeah)<br>
[ ] the metallic strips in the new bills (US Currency) are actually tracking devices<br>
[ ] Colonel Sanders is cryogenically frozen in a secret laboratory buried under the Chrysler building and he will return triumphant to rule the world after everyone has been brainwashed by the secret chemicals they put in the chicken<br>
<br>
2) Do the initials &quot;SS&quot; ring any bells other than the name of your guild?<br>
<br>
3) Have you taken your medication today? <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer. Master Smith. Tank.

Shattering Steel, in everything I've seen, is basically giving the Big Finger to the whole server. They are just learning now to try to be nice to make sure they don't alienate everyone, cos they are going to need friends. <br>

And Kommisar, it's actually called &quot;Martyr complex.&quot; Found in hippies, shaven-headed castrated cult members, and complete Dolts. I have two words for the members of Shattering Steel.... no, not those 2 words. <br>

At least from my experience.<br>
<br>
1.  There are no such things as UFO's.  They're really time travellers from the future who have come back to invest in many of our companies in order to live the nice life in 2245.  BTW, dont buy AMD, it'll go under after Disney aquires Intel in a stock deal sometime in 2105.<br>
<br>
2.  Alien Abductions.  Well I hear Pippi can give us the details on that.  Assuming she can put those rectal probes down for a minute.  How did you think druids learned how to cast spells that made people faster?  They experiemented on cattle then humans.  Magic has its prices after all.<br>
<br>
3.  Dead on bro.  Now you'll have to go into hiding before the military secret extermination squads are able to target you.  I suggest when you go underground you work in a totally seperate field so that they have a harder time tracking you.  I intend to go into the porn business myself.  They'll never suspect that.<br>
<br>
4.  My hidden microphone/camera was actually cleverly installed in the headset of my phone.  They were able to track all my calls that way.  Good thing the guys at the pizza shop and I had worked out a secret code before hand.  The camera was installed seperatly in the photocell on my porch light so that the CIA/KGB (you did know they've been working together since 1955 right?) would be able to track the people coming into my house for DUCK meetings.  However, I fooled them by removing the light bulb and they obviously did not use a UV camera.<br>
<br>
5.  Those metallic strips really arent tracking devices you know.  They're actually radioactive strips of plutonium designed to mutate your genes in order to get rid of the lower class of Americans who tend to carry cash in their wallets instead of using credit cards like their betters.  And you thought it was just the water that wasnt safe.<br>
<br>
6.  Colonel Sanders.  Ummm, you'll have to talk to the people in charge of DUCK for that.  I have been forbidden to disclose any information on that.  I hope your dues are paid up.<br>
<br>
I've taken my prozac today.  Gotta talk to my doc about upping the dosage and starting me on the shock treatments early.<br>
<br>
Its been my experience that many of the remaining members of SS post 50 probably believe in at least 2 of those.  The higher in levels you go, the more you tend to believe in it seems.  Yes, I agree, they're mostly seem to be children who have been denied what they want and are now having a temper tantrum.  I thought we could talk to them and work things out like mature people.  I was wrong.  Perhaps one day, but I wont hold my breath.  I figure if we do as others have suggested and just totally ignore them they'll go away eventually just like trolls when they arent fed anymore.  Still, I wasted an amusing 10 minutes answering your questionaire Komm, so maybe its good for something. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Before I left Fellowship I held within the guild the Norrathian Olympics. Some of the events included :<br>
<br>
- Strong Man competition (who can carry the most copper and still move with no sow or str buffs)<br>
<br>
- 6 Man Auto Follow race (must cross the finish line with all members of the group accounted for to count)<br>
<br>
- Relay Race 2 Types<br>
--2 Man Sprint (runner one goes to runner 2, hands off specific item, runner 2 runs back and gives it to judge first)<br>
--4 Man Long Distance Sprint (same Idea as the 2 man, just more people and longer distance<br>
<br>
There were alot more Ideas I had for events depending on attending classes. For example<br>
<br>
- TP race (druids are given a list of items to get/buy and must choose the quickest way to obtain them all and return to judge)<br>
--OR (must get the names of specific merchants or NPC's from select zones and return with all correct)<br>
<br>
- Wrestling/Gladiator's Ring (no weapons, no visual armor pieces, no magic, just duke it out)<br>
<br>
- Cliff Divers Competition - - bards and monks only - - (see how high they can jump from before taking dmg, highest wins)<br>
<br>
<br>
And so on and so on. I know there's more events that can be thought of (and not just useless duels) so if you guys want I'd be more than happy to try and run this on my day off from Valo stuff. The only catch will be prizes, we could take a donation stash and had out a few PP per win or maybe get some donated items. The whole point of this is knowing you won, not the prize at the end but you know how people are. If there's any interest I'll start it up.<br>

Anyway, those are some great ideas Lag.  If I can free up some time between trying to run some supplemental raids as well as the Planar stuff I'd like to see about running some of those.  I kinda like the relay race thing.  I believe Zatriz is trying one as well.<br>
<br>
For prizes, er...I'm kinda short on plat.  I've decided to try to run the Plane raids from my own account.  That being said, there is a CoG account I believe Komm is keeping track of, we might be able to dip a bit into that.  In fact, I'm using my own cash to fund my raids since that will free up the CoG accounts for things like that hopefully.  I do have some middle end items I might be able to donate.  Nothing fancy that a level 45 couldnt get with a hour or two of camping, but probably nice for a level 25-30.<br>
