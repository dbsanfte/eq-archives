Leave me out of this shit.  I keep my opinion of you and your croanies to myself.  I dont post about it, Too much of a conflict there.  Thanks for bringing up old memories dear.  *rolls her eyes*  <br>
<br>
My statement since I was drug into this is... No one keeps any information from SOYs beloved &quot;kenny&quot;  trust me the adoration these kids give him.  They tell him every little detail.  Trust me he used to come to me complaining about it before YBC was demolished.  If someone did a camp check.. Ken knew about the answer.<br>
<br>
I THANK (and have directly done so)  Rogg, Alinor, Aes, Sladen and all the other officers for giving me a chace to redeam myself to them.  I joined them after being with out  guild for 5+ months.  I held them with alot of respect and still do.  So it just shows the level of maturity and good grace CB has, they can put aside something and judge the person on who and what kind of character they are.  Rogg is very respected because he has earned it, he deals with things and his guild (as do ALL the officers) in a professional but still kind way.  <br>
<br>
<br>
What happened in kael I have been over with rogg and we both look back and laugh.  Now.. as I have asked YOU and  YOUR guild before... Please refrain from bringing me into your SOY shit on the server.. You know my feelings on this.  I have done my part to keep my feelings off these boards out of human respect and nothing more.  <br>

We found out Trak was up while we were just hanging out doing the spell farming thing and decided to make our go for him.  There was much trash talking between members of my guild and members of SoY who were starting to zone in - nothing major.  We did state our intention to do Trak, and SoY moved down towards us.  However, when I and my guild got to the cubby first, Kenshiiro told me that he and his guild would let us go.  We'd never pulled around Trak before, so as we're learning how to do it, I got constant tells from one of SoY's pullers, monk that started with a G, &quot;are you pulling yet?&quot; &quot;how about now?&quot; &quot;now?&quot; &quot;pulling Trak within the next week?&quot; &quot;this is easy stuff, why aren't you doing anything?&quot; Stuff like that.  I asked Kenshiiro to get the monk off of me, and he agreed.  The monk kept harping at me and SoY stayed en masse just outside the cubby area.  One of our pullers got ported away by Trak and the CR team accidentally brought some mobs back with him - he didn't know til he was already among the SoY people and boy, were they ticked.  It wasn't on purpose, and wouldn't have been a problem if we'd been left to our attempt.  They (not us) ended up moving Trak out into the hallway area.  At that point, we decided that it was too late to try to re-position Trak, and maybe have to deal with a CR, so we left and told SoY to have at it. <br>
<br>
We'd had a couple other minor incidents with SoY before - nothing big, but always left a bad taste in my mouth.<br>

<br>
You are at work.  You are a smoker.  Your place of employment allows you 5 minutes of each hour for a smoke break.<br>
<br>
Today, you are having a particularly bad day, and have been outside to smoke 3 times so far this hour.  As you light up your third cirgarette, the door opens and our Boss comes outside.  He says he would like to see you in his office for a minute.<br>
<br>
You begin to feel nervous.  You think &quot;Oh no...I know I should not have taken this many breaks, now I'm going to get in trouble.&quot;  Your heart begins to race and you put our your cigarette frantically while making your way to the Boss's Office.<br>
<br>
When you get inside he tells you that you did a good job on last week's project and hopes that next week's will be just as good.<br>
<br>
You leave elated, but you feel stupid that you got all worked up over nothing.  And you wasted a damn good cigaetter too.<br>
<br>
End of scenario.<br>
<br>
I ask you people this:  In this scenrio, did the boss exert undue pressure upon the smoker?  <br>
<br>
If so, why?  <br>
<br>
All he did was say he wanted to see her.  He didn't say &quot;Come right now&quot;, or &quot;You have 5 minutes to be in my office&quot;.  But that's how the smoker took it, wasn't it?  The smoker assumed the boss meant right now.  The smoker rushed to put out the cigarette when she didn't have to.<br>
<br>
Do you see my point?  Probably not.<br>

He apologized twice and I told him that his apology was appreciated and that we would give it another go once we recovered.  There was no further communication between us.

I never thought I had to get him to swear that they would not try to take him from under our noses.  As a GM to a GM, I accorded him respect.  CoN may not be uber, but we do have a reputation of being considerate of those we share the Rathe with.  We got that reputation from years, yes CoN has been around since April 1999, of acting in a manner that earned us that reputation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thaedson>Thaedson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 12:35:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Kael</span><hr size=1>   Jagger, you keep posting the same thing.

  Apparently under your scenario every guild in Norrath should be lined up behind each other in case guild #1 fails.  Then guild #2 can step over their corpses and make their day.  I think there are Severs that specialize in this type of treatment if your interested in taking it there - I always believed that just wasn't The Rathe.<br>

<br>
Just pointing out a couple of things..<br>
<br>
CoN had PLENTY of time to /tell kenshiiro and resolve this. It is called a 5 minute warning for a reason... IF we had every intention to pull vindi and steamroll CoN would he really have announced it ? Is he that dumb? Not only that, we also would have had to clear the temple guardian in order to safely pull vindi. There are very few guilds who can take vindi and 2-3 guardians. CoN pulling vindi hastely w/o clearing guards was not our fault, it was your puller's fault. If we were going to take vindi we would have also had either: A) pull vindi and 2 guards idiotically and get us all killed, or B) clear guards giving plenty of time for you guys to talk. Saying we rushed you is bull. No rush, no matter how you look at it. You had another 7 minutes (or so) to work things out. Want to blame somone for your wipeout, dont blame us, blame Sekhar for sporking it w/o sporking the guardians first.<br>
<br>
Taking vindi AFTER you guys wiped out, well I don't see the problem other then you guys are upset you get too excited and pre-ejaculated on the pull and wanted to take it out on us because we didn't give you a second chance. Look back about a month ago, we killed vindi, first time, statue was up so of course we were gonna try. We had FK in arena, waiting on us to fail. We hastely pulled, kenshiiro pulled the uberest train I have ever seen: 1 guardian, then statue poped on us, then his armor, then 3 more guardians. This was partially because we felt a little pushed and went in, past ice wall, to try and &quot;claim&quot; statue (Please FK, dont take this wrong, you were very nice to us, this is just reminds me of that..). Needless we say, we wiped (I would like to see bots take 4 guardians 2 armors and statue and live..), a FK cleric (sounds familiar so far?) came over ressed us and then FK took statue. We got our chance, WE failed. Did we sit and bitch at FK and post crap about them here? This is no different. We walked away, learning somthing from this (dont let kenshiiro pull..).<br>
<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
(was not meant to start anothing flame, I love FK, I thank them for giving us a shot, we learned from it and is why we are on rotation now.)<br>
<br>
Please, CoN, you have been respectable people, don't lose that flaming us over bullshit and half truths because you are angery YOUR puller screwed up. I have been to many raid with CoN and have lots of friends in the guild (I was there your first Inny kill what a time), but this meaningless bullshit about us ganking your vindi is crap.<br>
<br>
You guys remember in HoT when we ressed your cleric several times? If we were inconsiderate assholes, who don't give a shit about anyone but our own, would we have cared? It frustrates me that people sit here and bash our name over stuff that happened a very long time ago. Every guild has its moments, perhaps we weren't 100% nice and just sit there and hold your hand as you killed him, but we still did nothing wrong in the rules of the RTA or VI or the gentlemans agreement. IF you, perhaps, would have taken a second and asked Ken for a second shot, you would be adding him to your kill list, but you didn't bother to ask for a second try, so we assumed too many had left and it is our turn.<br>
<br>
Don't bring up lodi either.. we have had a level 60 shaman take him from us when we had 15+ member there for our first try at him. He is a race mob, FFA, FCFS, whatever. First agro, whatever.<br>
<br>
I am deeply sorry that CoN wiped out to vindi. This was NOT our fault.<br>

<br>
As you can clearly tell, CoN did a who all for Kael Drakkal.  A WHO ALL ZONE.  Ok, now that everyone who discredited my comment feels like a dumbass, I'll move on.<br>
<br>
Raitlin was at the raid.  I did not say he was not.  I said that for all YOU knew he was independant.  However, he was at the raid.<br>
<br>
I remember the trakanon incident that you're bringing up.  I was there as well.  And I was also dead due to S4H's train.  Anyways, S4H did get a chance.  We let them go, true.  We moved down ONLY in case you failed.  If you didn't, and won, we'd port out.  We moved down to save us 2 hrs from having to do so should ya'll fail.  Plus, we could help CR.  Why the fuck does SoY look like the bad guy here?  Oh wait, the G monk.  (Yes, I know who you're talking about).  Well, as we were waiting, we had to have waited at least 1 1/2-2 hrs.  At least.  And you were already down there.  Many of us were questioning why, when you were already at juggs and at trak, it would take ya'll 2 hrs to position him and move in.  Just the &quot;g&quot; monk decided to harp on it.  He didn't shut up when Ken told him to?  Jeez, what a surprise..../smack &quot;g&quot;  Anyways, /tells doesn't ruin an entire guild's attempt and the /tells were not what ruined your attempt at trak.  I agree &quot;G&quot; monk can be annoying, and in that instance was, but /ignore is there for a reason.<br>
<br>
Back to the Vindi issue.  Jeshter summed it up.  That's as simple as it gets.  <br>
<br>
Soy did not know<br>
We moved into position<br>
Proclaimed our pull<br>
Was stunned CoN had him<br>
We said we were going to be pulling him again<br>
CoN pulled nearly immediately (no communication)<br>
CoN wiped<br>
SoY apologized for their feeling rushed<br>
SoY clears out arena<br>
SoY pulls vindi<br>
CoN feels they should get a second shot (rightfully)<br>
SoY kills vindi<br>
CoN flames everyone in SoY (as noted in Nilasu's log)<br>
<br>
As everyone who is anyone is saying:  Miscommunication.  I was told that CoN wasn't going after him a 2nd time.  Do I have a log of that?  Nope.  Gonna have to take myword cause word is all a man has and all a man is.  I was told CoN was not attempting him again.  I do not remember by who, but that is when we proceeded from our &quot;backing off&quot; position to &quot;raid force&quot; position.  <br>
<br>
CoN (I'm guessing GL or RL?) states that he talked with ken and said they accepted the apology and were going to reprepare, and Ken did not respond afterwards.  Any logs on the conversation?  Because I was told CoN wasn't trying again; that's funny I'm told that when you say you're repreparing. (not saying you are lying).<br>
<br>
Anyways, this was a huge mishap.  I suggest everyone look at all the good things SoY has done rather than nit pick and tear them apart over 1-2 bad things <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->61st Beastlord<br>

<br>
Oh, as some of the CoN members said, I'm not here representing the Guild, I'm here representing myself.<br>
<br>
Before I say any I'm sure this post will be responded to by Rogg, and I'd like to say, I don't care what trash you throw my way Rogg.  I don't care what you bring up that happened between us, I don't care what you say or do to hurt my reputation on this server or any. Now, back to the issues at hand.<br>
<br>
1. I was one of the first people in Kael, I admit I did go Afk for a minute or two to grab a snack.  But upon returning I scrolled up, I saw Raitlin's camp check message and saw no response about Vindi. Then Kenny zoned in and shouted for a camp check. Again, no response about Vindi, now, I do have another comment. Even if I did miss the /ooc about Vindi when Raitlin called, it has always been my understanding to answer Camp Checks no matter how frequent.  If CoN did indeed respond the first time, on a basis to make sure there was no understanding they should have also responded to Ken's yet they didn't.  <br>
<br>
Now I have known Ken for over a year, and I will say that he is not lying. I was at my computer upon the Ken's /ooc, no response, and I was at my computer when Ken called for pulling Vindi. There was lots of response, and so Ken did what he should have, he stopped, and being in his group I know just about everything that happened during pulling. I asked a question, not sure exact wordage, but Ken responded in some manner saying we weren't pulling. I figured what the hell, Ken knows what he's doing, your call bud. So, now CoN had time to get ready, yet they didn't they instead rushed their pull, whether it was pullers fault or guilds fault I don't know. When they got completely and totally destroyed in a matter of seconds, maybe they lasted 1 minute we rezzed them. Now, after we totally destroyed Vindi I hear of this post, I realize I'm a little late but I'm posting. I checked here and all I see is a string of bad-mouthing against Yama.<br>
<br>
This seems to be a trend, like Nilasu said, whenever Yama does something wrong it's the biggest thing, but if someone else does something wrong we can all forgive and forget.  This is absolute bullshit, this makes me believe people are out to get us, and it seems to be true.  Anyways, back to the relevant conversation.<br>
<br>
Once I looked at some posts I noticed an inaccuracy. We did not rush CoN in the least, we actually gave them an opportunity. Now, CoN could have dealt with this without pulling, their leader could've contacted Ken, but as far as I know no effort was made, instead the puller attacked Vindi and pulled him. Therefore, it was not our fault in the least that CoN got owned and tossed to the curb by Mr. Vindi.<br>
<br>
2. Now that I've dealt with the large picture I'd like to deal with the personal one.<br>
<br>
Quote....<br>
Trolo, <br>
<br>
If that is your attitude, I'm glad to see you gone from our guild. Rogues should only backstab mobs. Try it.<br>
<br>
Hahahaha... you little asshole Rogg, fuck off. This is a fucking attack at Trolo and I will not stand for it. I used to respect you, even after you guild-removed me, I respected you, I knew it was my fault and I deserved what I got. That I accept, but I will not stand by and listen to you trash my bro.<br>
<br>
Now the whole time Trolo was in the guild it was my understanding he liked you and respected you, and you are a stuck-up prick. You immediatley disregarded Trolo's thoughts, you immediatley threw away any knowledge you had of Trolo and judged him, well that is wrong. I know Trolo isn't your classic gentleman, but he's not a lair, and you can just fuck off Rogg. As far as I'm concerned you are in the in the wrong, you are totally believing everything said by CoN and nothing from the other side, that is just being an ass. You are picking a side, and saying because I'm on this side it's right, anyone who is against it is wrong. Anyways, fuck off Rogg.<br>

That's funny, I'd call shooting tells at anyone and everyone he could find online, and trying to convince them that somehow Aesclepius and Alinor are the devil and horrible people, before guild removing, without discussing any issues he may have had in his mind with them in any way, that sounds pretty underhanded to me, and is part of the reason that I would be just as happy to hear that his online persona got hit by a truck. If you don't know his underhanded side, maybe you should rethink your candy coated view of little brother.<br>

Alinor.. as in ranger Alinor? HAHAA. Wow that's good stuff. The devil and horrible? If that's true (that Trolo said that), I don't know what dream world Trolo lives in or what drugs he's on, but maybe they should up the dosage. I don't know Aesclepius, but Alinor is far from the devil. I'd be honoured to be in a guild with her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tagian1>Tagian1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 1:06:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> heh... to what the GL of s4h said..<br>

Our side..<br>
We talked to Lom, they said they would let us have a shot at trak. We saw s4h in seb, so we asked. they said multiple times they were farming spells. We get down there get to the room with the invis wall, when they tell us they are trying trak. Well, that is nice, we just wasted several hours for nothing.. So, we say ok go for it. They take another 3 hrs doing what it should have taken 30 minutes. We are getting very impatient. So, they tell us to move on up. We are moving up when somone pulls some insane train on us.. we lose over half the raid killing their train. We were a little pissed by now. So, they left, by thos time we had 29 members for our first trak attempt. We screwed up, failed. Not blaming them, but there was no need to bring this up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cyruskahn>CyrusKahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 1:09:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kael</span><hr size=1> Make that 1-2 things ya'll think is bad which really isn't. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->61st Beastlord<br>

I know someone said in ooc that we were doing Trak because I was in tells with Nyca at the time to get the particulars on the rotation so that I was sure that we were kosher.<br>
I asked them to stop calling Trak for the time being until I cleared everything.  I know that SoY knew that we were going to attempt Trak well before they reached the cubby area.<br>
<br>
There is no time constraint - that was the whole problem with the evening - we were feeling rushed.  It was our first attempt, we were learning our way - if it took us 5 hours no biggie.  There was no reason for you to get impatient - you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>chose</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to stick around in case we had to CR.  We didn't make you.  And you were between where Trak ports people and us - we didn't intentionally kill you, and as I said, the monk didn't even know he had agro until he was already in the middle of your people sitting outside the cubby area.  Again, where you chose to sit to see if we had to CR.<br>
<br>
I brought it up because the situation was much the same - CoN felt rushed by SoY, I'd been there before, too.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tagian1>Tagian1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 1:17:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> WHoever from CoN,<br>

I can not speak for ken, but I am thinking he was saying hes sorry that you died, sorry you failed, sorry you rushed, sorry because he is a nice guy and he felt a little responsible? But look at it for what it is damnit, YOUR puller pulled too soon.. NOTHING to do with us. Don't fucking blame your rushing on us.. see the word YOUR.. YOUR rushing. Any human with 2 brain cells more then drache knows you just don't pull vindi with 2 guards, nor does the guild oposing you. So what ken wants to pull vindi? hes pulling vindi RIGHT then when he says he is.. no warning. Yeah, we gonna take vindi and 2 guards and live, common. use common sense, no one would pull vindi with 2 guards up. Him apologizing also has NOTHING to do with you rushing and failing.<br>

<br>
I'll have you know, that the day Abella applied to the Clan, I personally laughed her application off, because of what had happened in Kael.  We gave her a fair shot to prove herself though.  We put her through the wringer in her application process, and were very critical of almost every action she took on raids before she was tagged.  We were probalby more critical of her than we have been of *any* party interested in joining Clan Bashemded, and in the end, she proved, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that she'd outgrown the person she was at Kael.<br>
<br>
Abella is an upstanding and contributing member of Clan Bashemded, often leaving groups to rez guildies and such.  Regardless of her past actions in YBC, she's proven that she's a more mature player now, and done being one of your cronies.  I am proud to have her as a member of Clan Bashemded.  <br>
<br>
I will admit, was a nice way to try and change the focus of the heat on you, but it didn't work.<br>
<br>
FAIL!!! Get a rez!  and eat a bowl of dick while you're at it.<br>
