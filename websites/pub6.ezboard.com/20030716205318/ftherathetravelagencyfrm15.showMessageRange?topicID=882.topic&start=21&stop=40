I have nothing against immigrants, I am proud to live in a country where we can offer other cultures a chance to live a better, the best, life.  I would like to think they all become Americans, have families here, pay taxes and put money back into OUR economy.<br>
<br>
My problem is with the Goverment/Big Business/Immigrant arrangement this country has.<br>
<br>
Let me explain it once again.<br>
<br>
Big Business doesnt wanna pay high wages.  Goverment tells Big Business we can give 40 thousand immigrants works visa's and they will work for half of what you pay the american workers.  Big Business likes this deal.  Goverment expects so much money from Big Business a year in contributions for making this deal.  40 thousand immigrants come here, make half the money, send 75 percent of it back to thier home, live in shit apartments because they want to send as much money home as they can, they go home in 4 years for thier arranged marriages and live like Kings.  <br>
<br>
And dont try telling me this is a load of shit because ive met these guys.  My husband makes friends with all the Sahheeeds, and Ababs and whatever at work and I have spent time with them.   They fully admit this is what they do.  Do I blame them for doing it??  NO, I would probably do the same thing, but i don't have to like them for it, and sure as shit don't have to like the Goverment and Big Business for it.  There is nothing I can do, but vote, and everyone knows thats a fucking joke anyway.  <br>
<br>
<br>
So get off my back for being pissed they are taking money out of OUR pocket, OUR economy, and sending to THIER home and THIER economy, and let me continue being a bitter bitch about it please.  <br>

<br>
They are people given special permision to come to this country to work for a specified amount of time... ok now this is the importnat part pay attention... ONLY IF THEY ARE SPONSORED BY A CORPORATION and their Visa expires INSTANTLY once theyre fired<br>
<br>
they pay little or no income tax....<br>
<br>
and the corporation pays little or NO withholding, social security ect.<br>
<br>
Legal Imigration of highly trained people IE Techheads, Doctors, Scientist is GOOD!!!<br>
<br>
Having people shipped over to work for pissant wages and be forced to work as many hours as the corporation deems fit or face deportation is BAD!!! <br>
<br>
H1B is basically Indentured servitude dressed up all nice<br>
<br>
Jurr.. you wouldn't work for what H1B visa people get payed as it is usually slightly higher than what the average McDonald worker makes<br>
<br>
<br>
Toric... &lt;yawn&gt; know something about what you post about before you post .. you just come off sounding silly.. H1B visas are NOT about allowing forgein trade and a free market and economy .. they're about CHEAP SWEAT SHOP TYPE LABOR exploiting workers that if they had IMIGRATED to this country could make a living wage, but since they came via H1B theyre basically SLAVES to their sponsor.<br>
<br>
H1B isn't about The American Dream its about cheap labor at the expense of the tax payer, american worker, AND the H1B worker!!!!!<br>
<br>
If there were no H1B visa talented workers would migrate here get GOOD paying jobs and pursue the American Dream but, H1B says to them, &quot; hey you can come work here for a year or two for pennies on the dollar you third world scum but don't plan on staying&quot;<br>
<br>
the ONLY people who gain from H1B are the Corporation, The Lobbyist, and the scummy Politicians who profit from donations...<br>
<br>
Not the American Tax payer<br>
Not the American Worker<br>
Not the H1B visa holder<br>

The argument always in support of these visas comes down to engineering, particularly the classic areas like mechanical, chemical, etc as opposed to computer engineering and comp sci. Those areas we most definitely NEED these people coming here because there are not enough qualified people in the U.S. working in those jobs. Due to the way these laws have been written, however, other tech jobs where there are tons of people available get lumped in an companies take advantage of the fact.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I have little sympathy for the people getting &quot;screwed&quot; because most went into those fields because they were &quot;hot&quot; jobs at the time and offered great pay. Many of those jobs can also be done by a half trained monkey (e.g., IT work) and thus you get overflow of people. The slow down of the internet/computer boom meant a lot of people are left out in the cold. Blanket cries for the removal or lessening of the number of worker visas won't get you ANYWHERE because the liberals are all for the idea of bringing other people here, and the conservatives are beholden to big business that don't want the system changed. Working for a changing in the categorization of the system so those fields in need of foreign skilled labor get the majority of the visas is another issue.<br>
<br>
Ignorant ranting on &quot;bleeding hearts&quot; and hatred because you are getting screwed by something just makes you sound like a short sighted selfish jackass. Hey, you know what? Those &quot;bleeding hearts&quot; are the same people that are going to give two shits about your problems, so stfu. Do you really think a republican gives a shit about your husband being out of work? Just the free economy at work. You want to take that hard line and the &quot;me me me!&quot; perspective then suck it up and actually stick to your beliefs rather than turning tail the moment they work against you and cry foul. <br>

Someone who wants to work legally in this country shouldn't have to leave home at 2:00 am in the monring to stand in line to get an appointment date, for which they will have to be abck in line on that day at teh same time, (wind rain snow or just dark parking lot with a long line of strangers.<br>

<br>
I noticed someone mentioned that there is a lack of qualified people the the computer tech. Comp. Sci industry in the US.<br>
<br>
That is wrong, it's the same argument that the H1B lobbyists use to gain support.<br>
<br>
The problem is not a lack of people, the problem is that people from other countries with the same skillset will work for half the amount simply because the US dollar is worth like ten of their dollars (I don't know the real exchange rate, but suffice to say one of ours is worth more than one of theirs). <br>
<br>
So Joe the CEO says damn I get the same work done, for half the money AND Bob in accounting says I don't have to pay employment taxes.<br>
<br>
Obviously, like any human would, the foreign workers take advantage of it since they get more money than they normally would, AND they get to come live in this awesome country for a while.<br>
<br>
I can name ten VERY qualified people off the top of my head who are unemployed right now, and a non-english speaking, less qualified person is doing the job they used to do.<br>
<br>
Work Visas are great when there's a real need, but the way the laws are now they are just taken advantage of.<br>
The government should make it non-beneficial to the companies to bring in H1B workers. There should be some sort of law on how much you can pay them. If you force and extremly high wage on H1Bs then companies would be detered, and it would end the &quot;endentured servitude&quot; argument as well.<br>

Jur, if you are reading this and you got this far. Just to let you know I don't think H1B holders are any less qualified than the general american workforce. I really just think that they are by and large a detriment to our economy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vyxn>vyxn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/5/02 8:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=882.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> When I call customer service at the PHONE company Why can't they speak @#$^%#@$! english!!!  <br>

Been a while since I posted here. I'll share my thoughts, tho.. <br>
<br>
I've never been in contact with a H1B visa. I work in the restaurant industry. Don't really do a lot with &quot;white collar&quot; jobs. However, let me paint you a picture.<br>
<br>
This picture will villainize both the employer, and the employee, and maybe fling a lil mud at the US Govt. as well. <br>
<br>
Ever hired anyone? Have you ever needed a spot filled? Have you ever hired someone you knew didn't deserve the job, because you were desperate for a &quot;placeholder&quot; as it were? Well, this goes on every day. EVERY DAY. In every restaurant in the USA. <br>
<br>
The funny thing is.. While you guys are bitching about taxes lost, and H1B visas, these cats are robbing the American people blind. I've seen 16 year olds hired, that claim to be married and have 6 dependents. SIX. You think they have kids living with them, while tooling around in brand new vehicles with the name RODRIGUEZ in the back window? <br>
<br>
On top of that, I speak fluent Spanish, and am clued in to the fact that the majority of Green Cards or Work Permits you see are forged bullshit. You can get a green card and a Driver License in Texas for 100 bucks at Trader's Village. But, you can't refute any of it, legally. The Bill of Rights, and amendments to employee laws makes it illegal to question shit like this. These guys are working 2 jobs, pulling in 50 - 60k a year, living in an apartment with 6 of their buddies, probably getting food stamps, driving new cars, paying no taxes, and sending home money to Zacatecas.. <br>
<br>
Fuck the white collar H1B visas.. Look at the illegals that get hired every day, for jobs that Americans won't work..<br>
<br>
Check yourself, check the govt., check the INS, check hiring practices.. It sucks, but I don't see a solution.<br>

Basically, that since these sectors are categorized together on the quota of the visas given out each year, some companies take advantage of the categorization, and hire these workers for such jobs (and further exacerbate the problem with the lack of classical engineering professionals available, leading to more lobbying to get more of these visas).<br>
<br>
You come out of college with a degree in a classical engineering field (outside of geochemical anyway) and you have a job waiting. There is a glut of computer related tech people though, because as a &quot;hot&quot; commodity, everyone went into the field. The same thing happened to my uncle back in the 70s. He went into geochemical engineering due to the high salary at the time due to a lack of people trained, and the major need for these people to work on the alaskan pipeline and texas oil companies, offshore drilling, etc. By the time he got out of college with his degree, there were so many people that had gone into the field he couldn't get a job, and ended up selling cars for 10 years before finally getting hired by the air force to work on environmental issues.<br>
<br>
Same deal happening with the computer industry, glut of qualified people, lack of jobs, lots of people out of work (and that's why most of such people are out of work, not a few thousand foreign workers taking &quot;all&quot; the jobs, but I guess they make a nice target to place the blame for some).<br>

<br>
For the most part I sign on with Toric because I have been to COV board as an officer and then I come here to check on things that might be of interest to our members..<br>
<br>
I use Seer family when I am just cruising multiple EQ related ezboards, and I am posting as a EQ player not as an officer of a guild. <p>Toric Seerson<br>

<br>
I am a 46 year old female, I have 2 children, 1 stepson, and 3 grandkids.<br>
<br>
I have been playing since 1999, however I have had bouts of getting involved in RL and my son has been playing off and on since 1999. He started Caitsith as his first toon, when we swapped who was playing on the account, he always played Cait. When I would play again I would play all my toons equally, hence Cait got more play time during my off months. <br>
<br>
I am as likely to be in Blackburrow as Seb. For the last year I was primarily playing Toric or Caitsith because I was a guild leader. And because of that I would as likely be posting on Toric representing the guild as guild leader.<br>
<br>
But since I also cruise a number of ezboard sites..I created the Seer family account in order to clarify why I might be posting on a mage site one day and a cleric site teh next.<br>
<br>
You clear now. I am ussually these days on Shariona.  <p>Toric Seerson<br>
