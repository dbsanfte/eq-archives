This attempt on Fear was an unmitigated disaster.<br>
<br>
To begin with, we were VERY late getting started. This was unavoidable as we had some issues to clear up related to the server reset earlier in the day. To be truthful, I think the long startup time had a direct impact on our discipline the remainder of the night.<br>
<br>
We ended up with a pretty good mix class-wise, though our chronic shortage of healers was once more in evidence. At start time, we had two groups without significant healer support. We kicked the night off with 59 people... well over what I'd actually intended, but doable none the less.<br>
Two groups cleared the spec caves in very short order, and the raid promptly moved into the portal area. A huge thanks to Tremor and Baptismo and all those who helped on the outside. One of the few things that went right was that while we were making the first attempts, the caves were kept cleared for the returning melees.<br>
<br>
We got reorganized in good order, and I briefed the raid again, mostly covering the points I'd already covered, but also explaining the break tactic in more detail. On every important, make-or-break point, I stopped the briefing and had each group leader confirm with each member of their group individually that the point was clear and understood. That turned out to be a total waste of time.<br>
<br>
With the briefing done, the Pull Group sent in a FD watcher to let us know when the portal was clear. Another thing that went right was the Pull Group. Their performance was nothing short of exemplary the entire night.<br>
<br>
With the portal momentarily clear of wanderers, Group 2 zoned in to open the battle. Here is where things started to break down. Group 2 zoned, and made the camp with little difficulty. Group 1 was supposed to follow them in within seconds, but confusion, then a single bad decision on my part left Group 2 fighting alone for far longer than the plan called for. Group 1 finally zoned in, followed in short order by Groups 3 and 4. Within seconds, the camp was trained for the first time on the night. More than one person ran straight out from the portal, down the hill, gathered up a half-dozen mobs, and THEN turned left to find the campsite. Good thing we stopped the briefing to make sure everyone knew how to get to the West camp, I see.<br>
<br>
From here, it was all down hill. Our numbers became rapidly depleted by the failure of some to abide by the instructions on where to bind. Eventually, two full groups from the designated break team had to be replaced because their melees were scattered around Norrath. For the first three charges, we tried to stick with the plan, and even beef it up by adding an extra group. EACH and EVERY charge was marked by MORE THAN ONE person training the camp. Not once or twice were we thwarted by this. SIX times we charged, only to be trained and overwhelmed each time. That is the crux of why were were defeated. I don't care who you are, you will not break Fear if you cannot control the agro to the camp and keep it to a reasonable number of mobs.<br>
<br>
Another thing that went right. Our Enchanters coordinated their efforts, and worked their behinds off trying to keep things at the camp in hand in the face of huge trains. They were thwarted mostly by the sheer number of adds, and on a few occassions by people FAILING TO ASSIST. How basic is this, and how many times did we say it. I do not care if you are standing around wondering what to hit. Under NO circumstances do you EVER manually target and hit auto-attack. A very few people were authorized to do that, while others repeatedly took it on themselves to choose a target.<br>
<br>
Here comes the complaint that &quot;The Main Assist wasn't fighting anything!&quot; or &quot;Assist wasn't working!&quot;. I don't care. You stand there at look at the mobs until the disignated person call their target, even if you fall asleep at the keyboard waiting for it. Now on at least 3 occassions, the complaint actually had some merit. This was because our Druids CHARMED THE PRIMARY TARGET? Okay, this was partially my fault. I suppose most Druids are not used to using this ability in a group situation, and thus are not nearly as adept as the Enchanters are at using it effectively. Still, it seemed pretty obvious to me that you want to charm the ADDS... NOT the primary target! Even with this mistake, however, no one should have taken it on themselves to choose another target until the Main Assist called a new target, and more than one person did just that.<br>
<br>
I'll give each and every one of you credit for having enough heart to sustain this raid as long as it went. For attack after attack, we charged in with enough firepower to take and hold the camp, only to be thwarted by those few who could not hold discipline. You made these charges with minimal whining and bickering, and that speaks well for all of you. You all showed extrodinary patience throughout the night.<br>
<br>
After 6 fruitless charges, and with our force greatly depleted, I called the raid and asked for help in breaking the zone and recovering our bodies. Aeschelus had contacted me shortly after the third charge saying that Forged Alliance could muster the strength for a CR, and that he'd be glad to help if needed. When I asked him after our final charge, he ported over within minutes and began putting the CR team together, filling in the FA teams with our raiders as needed. Many thanks to Forged Alliance, and to those of you who volunteered to charge in yet again. The camp was taken on the first attempt, and was not trained, so was held. Reses began shortly thereafter, with the last being done by about 5 a.m. CST.<br>
<br>
Here are the basic lessons learned:<br>
<br>
1. My plan had a fundamental flaw in that I split our force at the start. This was based on the premise that we would take the camp with a small, disciplined team, then bring in the other teams when the way was clear. I should have used our numbers and taken the whole force in from the first charge on.<br>
<br>
2. The West camp, or any other camp, cannot be broken if people insist on training it. The FD's were reporting to me each time that this person came in with three on them, and that person ran to the camp with 4 on them. If you trained the camp, you know who you are.<br>
<br>
3. Druids, do not charm the primary target. Charm the adds. If you charm the primary target, you throw the force into confusion and discipline evaporates within seconds.<br>
<br>
4. Setting up and using a Pull Group is a viable and effective tactic if you have the right people for it. This group was keeping me aware of the status of the zone right from the beginning, though I didn't always make the best use of their information. If we'd broken the camp, they were organized and ready to begin pulling the zone just as soon as we had everyone in and ready. Sadly, they never had the chance to show off all the preliminary work they did toward that.<br>
<br>
5. Group Sex was the most fun group to be in. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
We were defeated last night, in detail, but if we learn the lessons listed above, and any others that may be added to this thread by the rest of you, we can avoid ever having another disaster of this magnitude. We will be back. This zone, even beefed up, is no match for us if we maintain discipline and do the things we know how to do. Last night, we didn't.<br>
<br>
I apologize wholeheartedly to all of you. The final lesson learned is that I should have come down harder from the first on those people who trained the camp. It's not a lesson I'll forget.<br>
<br>
Many thanks once more to Aeschelus and all those who stopped what they were doing to come over and help us get out of the zone. You have our gratitude, and our congratulations on a job well done.<br>

<br>
1. look around as you run to camp, dont just barge down there<br>
<br>
2. once your there stay on the wall, not one inch from it and DONT SIT<br>
<br>
3. dont pull mobs that are close, let them come to you (if they dont agro let em walk past)<br>
<br>
4. root the mob by the tree and dont let him run<br>
<br>
5. on your assist button - instead of having <br>
<br>
/assist belce<br>
/assist rbecka<br>
<br>
 - change it to<br>
<br>
/target rbecka<br>
/assist rbecka<br>
<br>
(second assist should be on a different button anyway)<br>
<br>
Belce and Rbecka were constantly on different targets, there should be no confusion, just use 1 person on your assist key or your targeting runs the risk of lagging up and BAM you're on the wrong one. (there was constant assist problems because of this practice as where the recue group had no such problems)<br>
<br>
6. when a person is rezzes same standing rule applied. You are low on life, no mana so you're gonna sit and double your agro range? Thats a death wish. Stay standing. It doesn't matter if you dont have mana, you'll get it soon enough but whats the point in mana if you're dead again.<br>
<br>
<br>
There were alot of other things I picked up on myself and will be aplying in our guilds runs but it was mostly small stuff and not really needed here. So now its time for me to go get 53 back for Raval and Flarren back to 47.<br>

<br>
We had a good plan and we had the horses to make the run, unfortunately we lacked the riders on those horses to make it work.  <br>
<br>
Assist not working?  It seemed to work well for the team that helped us get our corpses back.  I know that everyone did use a hot key for this and dutifully clicked it when the target was called out, did those people have a target already selected when they did so?  Were they already in auto attack on that target?  If so next time you get a pull in, target another and attack then assist, it won't change your target.  <br>
<br>
Yep, charming the current target was disturbing.  Great a couple more seconds and this one will be.... charmed. &lt;sigh&gt;  Now we have to switch targets, which with a single group is no problem really, but we have 4 or more to switch targets and that takes time and wastes the effort done on that target and the effort lost due to time taken for the switch.  It also contributed to a loss in confidence in assist working.<br>
<br>
Attacking mezzed MOB's resulted in the death of our crowd control.  No player on a raid like this should be clicking on a MOB and then hitting auto attack, doing so will just release the MOB to seek out the enchanter, most likely jumping over your shoulder and through a crowd.  Don't have a target?  Hit the esc key and then the /assist key, still no target look for the main assist and target, then /assist again.  <br>
<br>
I think that those that went in with the CR team will say is that they did what we had planned.  <br>

<br>
Dogedme did a great job organizing and briefing everyone but unfortunately we still had people who were not aware of the instructions.  I'm not sure if it was just that everyone is not familiar with the &quot;stand and die&quot; rule, or that we were all overanxious to get things moving but we had lots of people who were training the camp.  I was standing in a safe place between the portal and the camp on the 3rd attempt break in and all further break ins (I didn't hit my hide key quickly enough on the first two and I have the corpses to prove it), and I personally watched many people get aggroed, REALIZE it, and then run to the camp, wiping out our forces.  This is far from acceptable.  If you read the pre-briefing you should know that if you are not on the pull or break in teams, bringing ANYTHING back to the camp is against the rules, and not indicative of an experienced raider.<br>
<br>
The next thing problem we had was assisting.  I know that not only did we sometimes have our primary and secondary assists on different targets, but we also had some charmed targets, some people who got confused during our whole &quot;who's the primary assist&quot; discussion, some people who's hotkeys didn't work properly, and some people apparently not assisting at all.  I would recommend that from now on each of you not familiar with large scale raids, make two hotkeys, one primary, one secondary.  When assisting, wait until you see the message in shout or ooc (whichever is being used, should be shout) by the primary assist calling out the target.  The primary assist should have ALREADY engaged combat BEFORE calling out the target, as the /assist function only works if the person being assisted has auto attack on (there are exceptions to this but for the most part it's the case).<br>
<br>
Other than that I think we had a very good fighting force.  The pull crew, and all other FDers did a great job moving their positions around without dying (despite a few Death Touches by Cazic's little helpers) and otherwise following directions and being patient.  The groups outside from what I heard were also similarly patient despite the long waits.  Of course they did have plenty of drinking to keep them occupied ( I received a number of tells from some absolutely TRASHED raiders trying to tell me some important things only succeeding in making my head hurt from trying to decode what they were saying.)<br>
<br>
You have become better at Drunken Cryptography! (21)<br>
<br>
I also want to say that Dogedme did a very professional job.  Although I have never attended a raid under his leadership before I would gladly do so again.  I hope he does not loose heart.  This defeat reflected in no way upon his leadership abilities, as someone who watched the whole thing from the inside, I can attest to that.  Also, none of you raiders better loose heart either, because next time we go into that plane, we're going to be a tightly balanced, well-tuned killing machine, and those mini-bosses are going to seriously regret all of those Death Touches we received (I'm still sore from mine).<br>

<br>
As for the hot keys, yes, that probably was a mistake to include that in the briefing. It's becoming obvious to me from these posts that no one hotkey setup is right for everyone. The assist key should be set up to match the players ability, experience and apparently even system to some extent. I used the setup in the briefing, which I've been using for maybe two weeks now, and I never once had a failed assist the entire evening. If you don't take away anything else from this discussion, please remember the point made about not assisting until after the target has been called. If you assist before the call, it's quite possible you will find a target and engage it. It's equally probable that you will be on the wrong target. Also, work with your assist key outside a large raid environment. Find what works for you, and when you join the raid, use the setup that you are certain will put you on the correct target absolutely every time. There's no reason all the hotkeys have to be the same.... what's important is that the end result is the same.<br>

<br>
Just a oppinion from the pull group cleric here.<br>
<br>
I dont think the initial break in strategy was a problem. Well except one thing. The ENTIRE night should be 'Stand and Die'. The intial break in was get to camp and fight, regardless if you are aggroed. The stand and die was not in effect on the first try. Which was needed.<br>
<br>
But more importantly, I like the idea of the 4-5 break in groups and no more. (which is what ultimatly worked, or i think it was only 4)  That is 4-5 groups of very disciplined people. That last break in was actually alot of fun. For some reason I felt safe when we arrived at camp and started clearing wanderers. It was good to have somthing go right. It gave us a feeling of accomplishment.<br>
<br>
The more people or groups you throw in there the better chance there is of those small number of people training camp. The more people.. the bigger chance of aggro. <br>
<br>
It actually can be represented statistically. For the more people you put in thier the higher the percentage of mistakes their will be made. Remeber your chain is only as strong as the weakest link, very evident last night.<br>
<br>
How do we fix? Veterans. People with proven discipline, and a number of sucessful raids under thier belts. People who the leaders know can do the job right. And in turn themselves are leaders.<br>
<br>
<br>
anyways, I'll see you all laters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
------------------<br>
They changed assist last patch to target (and attack if you have that option on) your assist person's target, wether they are actually attacking or not. <br>
Personally, I think this is a huge pain in the ass, and I've noticed a large number of our chanters and clerics are taking some extra abuse because of it......<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>
So it looks like people should not hit that assist button until the main uses /shout to annouce what they are attacking. Otherwise the main could have gotten hit by a mob (automatically targeting said mob), then that mob is mezzed, and then changes to a mob that cannot be mezzed. Which is then the /shout target.<br>
<br>
Also, just a thought. Put your ATTACKONASSIST in your eqclient.ini to FALSE and then when you assist you wont auto attack. You then check your target... if you thing it may be wrong... assist the main again (/target rbecka /assist)<br>
<br>
With the ATTACKONASSIST to FALSE you have little to no chance of breaking mez. Only after you have sucessfully assisted the main.. you hit your auto attack key.<br>
<br>
but then again, how are you gonna explain that to 50 people 6 minutes before we zone in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
West wall breakins are not to use the entire raid. You only use 3-5 groups of experienced people you trust. You go in, have everything in those 3-5 groups hit one target, kill it and all groups evac at the same time. Regroup, med up, wait for the FD'ed person at the portal to say it's clear, zone in, kill another mob and evac. Keep doing this until the 12 or so portal wanderers are dead. No groups are to evac until the raid commander calls an evac, then they all go. If all groups are assisting on the same target, and the evacers don't get swamped, this should work out quickly and well. The more mobs you kill on each attempt in, the easier the next attempt will be. The idea is to clear the portal of wanderers and any extra mobs you might aggro, then once you feel safe at the west wall, zone the rest in one group at a time. <br>
<br>
What happens if you zone everyone in at the same time is that you have many Linkdeaths, and as Rez said, the more folks you get in there, the better chance that a mob or 20 will aggro on them, the camp will be trained and you have a wipeout. <br>

<br>
I think its all been covered here.  We had the numbers but a number of factors ended up with the results that all who went are very aware of.<br>
<br>
I would like to give some credit to a group of random players outside the spectre cave, they wanted some experience so we let them have as many specs as they could handle.  There wasn't anyone back at the first spectres after the groups had arrived at the portal.  I think its because no one felt comfortable leaving the portal area as they weren't told to.  In the future, one of the groups assigned to clearance should move out to the beginning of the cave once the clear groups are assigned.  You'll still hear the instructions.  Your job will become evident when the zone break teams start streaming back in the door.  I know its a little frustrating to be coming back, naked and have to deal with 2 spectres on the way to the door.  Some of  us are lucky and have spells to deal with it, but others don't and the break-in team needs their mana.<br>
<br>
I took a break from EQ today, I was beat.  I have some xp to make up as well, but then so does everyone.<br>
<br>
Till the next time, <br>

Have fun, practice what you've learned.<br>
