Moral of the story: If you are waiting for someone to kill or fail at VS dont wait at the cubby, because if a train happens, wether you did it or not, you WILL be blamed for it.<br>
<br>
RF shoulda known that.  This has happened waaaay too many times in the past. <p><p><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left">Sultar McWeiser<br>Warlord of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usultar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sultar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.sacanimalshelter.org/images/s.gif BORDER=0> at: 8/19/01 2:42:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxeddrc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xedd RC</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC= http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif  BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>LOM</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/19/01 2:45:13 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.guildsob.com/artwork/eva345.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FYI </span><hr size=1> So far, I'v heard facts flipping back and forth Slitz saying, he's not sure about a train, I'v talked to a couple MD's members who were upset just the same about it.<br>
<br>
But hey all that aside let me explain to you why i'm pissed off.<br>
<br>
<br>
Legend of Marr, is more then capable of killing Venril Sathir everytime we take the opertunity something always goes wrong. In this case it was interference from a guild which has more &quot;power&quot; then us. Frankly, I don't myself do these raids for loot, I want to fight VS because we haven't had the opertunity to straight up fight him yet. Some people just feel that its fun to ruin other peoples fun on account of loot. I'm still not going to say Raging Fury trained, I'm just going to say that I know of the shady things RF has done in the past, and I have heard ex-members tell me about the &quot;anything goes to get what we want&quot; mentality. Now you can straight up step to me and say that this is all a lie but your just defending your own asses. There is a reason why kearlie hates your asses, and its the same reason why you are getting up there on my people I really don't like one bit. <br>
<br>
The reason is you do crap that is just totally self centered because you want your damn loot. Well tell you what get yer fucking loot I don't want it I play everyquest to have fun and guilds EXACTLY like you ruin it for me. You are the equivilant to a griefer in a PVP server. Infact I bet if we had run back up in there and were able to KS VS from you you would have petitioned some GM's to try and get us banned. I'm sorry Raging Fury everything you say just reeks of you trying to save your own asses. Sure theres about 100 things that could have happened, but I posted the story as it happened and let the people who know what kind of crap you pull decide. <br>
<br>
You put several people including myself in a bad mood for the rest of the day, because of your little show and you know what I'm sick of it, I'm not going to try to be diplomatic with you anymore. I am just going to flat out say that because of this incident, I can't trust any member of Raging Fury again, I bet there's some great people in raging fury. <br>
<br>
Good Going Eberan and fellow officers for your wonderful bully tactics. I now like everyone on this server except for you. <br>
Even the people who hate me and make fun of me I still like because their doing that doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of the game. What you all did directly interfere's with my enjoyment of the game. What is the worst about it is you don't give a shit, if you cared you would be cool about it and own up to it. I remember when bots did stuff that was &quot;shady&quot; and they had the balls to own up to it. Based on what i'v seen and heard from you in the past the situation points to one thing, you trained us we died you took the kill gave the bad loot to your sister guild and took off. Congratulations you have convinced all the people on the rathe who don't know the shit you pull that you didn't do anything wrong. <br>
<br>
and on a further note. As a person I have a shakey trust in mankind, and this hasn't helped any. Now I know even moreso what greed does to people. Raging fury you are like an Athelete who gambles and shaves points. You ruin the integrity of everquest. Every 50+ person who plays EQ has to have some sort of commitment to this game and you have shown me that your commitment is that of doing whats best for you and only you and screwing over anyone in your path that you can. What's worst about it though is that you try to cover it up with ambigious stories and &quot;I think so's&quot; or &quot;get yer facts straight.&quot; You ruin the integrity of not only the rathe server but everquest in general, and the select few people in the world who play online games as a hobby. I don't trust people as much now because of you. Hope you feel good.<br>

<br>
We were a group of people from MD playing in the prep room waiting for the VSR to pop for Wildroots epic. Then suddenly the VS himself poped and of course killed us all. We had a friendly rogue to CR us all out, and then we decided to try take VS. We first asked RF to help us, because we didnt have the manpower to kill him all by our selfes. But RF said no - that they had another raid/wasnt enough online. We asked several guilds to help. We then managed to get at least 2 full groups of MD only and some outsiders, and decided to give it a try, even if we knew it would be almost impossible. But at least we would have tried.<br>
<br>
When we were making groups at the zone, people from LoM began to gather, and they was also after the VS. We agreed to let us have a go first, and if we failed, then LoM would have a try, and if they failed, we would try all together.<br>
<br>
MD then went to the Prep room and began buffing up, when a bounch of RF suddenly was in the zone (half an hour after we asked for their help, and they said no),  - they were after VS - NOT to help us, but to take him out by themself.<br>
We agreed with LoM to give it a try together, since our chance was much better when we stood together, and since RF would not wait for our attamtps to kill him.<br>
<br>
RF began to show up in the prep room and sat there watching us which was very stressfull. LoM finally came and we began to discuss the stategy to use on VS. Then RF said that if we didnt attack him soon, they would - no matter if we were there first or not. I know it took a long time to discuss strategies, but it was our first big encounter. So as you can imagine we were even more stressed. We didnt even get time to buff up poperly. The athmosphere was very hostile at that time, and we were afraid that RF would backstab us and just attack VS. So LoM made a pull - a very bad pull. Unprepared as we were, we all died of course.<br>
And yes. There was a train of mobs suddenly attacking our clerics and casters from behind. I did not see where is came from or who caused it.<br>
<br>
You claim that RF was there to help us, your sisterguild? Then I would like to know why you didnt speak to us about coordination at all? You never spoke of helping us a single time. We would have been happy for your help - very happy, since we are unexperienced on mobs like VS and really could use help from experts. But you never offered your help. Never.<br>
<br>
You came, you saw, and you succeded in not letting us have a good first time on a uber mob.<br>
<br>
I am sorry, and I am sad, but please dont read this as a flame. It is just my side of the story.<br>

  I really dont know where you get this view of RF friend but you couldnt more wrong. <br>
<br>
  And no I am not saying to save our asses, but because people are getting a bad idea of what and what RF is because of posts like yours Xedd <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
  I have never seen a single time where RF decided to step over anybodys head. People who know me, be it from SoT/NB/Bots will tell you I am a straight, no-nonsense and nice type if person. I would never condon anyhting like your trying to say RF is, and thats the truth of that. <br>
<br>
People from RF who responded to this thread didnt do it to save their asses, but to try to make things straight. <br>
<br>
(sorry for the following caps, but you seemed to have skipped my previous post somehow)<br>
<br>
BTW YOU STILL HAVENT ANSWERED ME XEDD, HOW COME YOU GOT VS IN PREP ROOM IF YOU DIDNT ATTACK IT?<br>
<br>
Just answer that before anymore talk of us training please?<br>
I think you can see I am not a flamer, so just for the sake of knowing what happened (you were not there, right?) please try to find out how come you guys ended up with VS in prep room? That might shed some light...<br>
<br>
MD (Thana) just admitted that VS was pulled. Dont know if you pulled him to prep room, but usual way to go is to clear the mobs around and then charge his room. Reason you guys died is you pulled at wrong time or pulled wrong is my best bet. Those things happen, they happen to RF too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I hope putting your deaths on our back makes you feel better, that would at least make this post have a good purpose <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I will say it again, and people can believe me or not I guess, all I ever heard on /guidlchat that day was to stay in safe cubby and later the &quot;camp&quot; order.<br>
<br>
Hoping people will for once try to see the good before jumping to the bad (I am a dreamer, I know)<br>

It's very obvious (well at least to me) that you would at some point make a post like the one you just wrote.<br>
Second, who are you to flame us like this anyway? <br>
You are one of the persons that got all his information from other players... Maybe I have to remind you once again, you were NOT online when this happened Xedd, so you know as much about this issue as your local farmer. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to let you, that obviously know nothing about our guild, try to insult us like this Xedd, and before you draw more conclusions about the happening I recommend you to talk to any Mighty Danes officer or Guildleader and really find out what happened.<br>

As I said before, I can't know for sure that we didn't train because as far as I know this could have happened:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A druid from RF who is in Cubby room already, cast invis (so no one can see him runnig out of the cubby), use a 9th sense yet to be known by mankind: to force me putting down my fingerbone hoop in my bag and then clear out my memory , tell a rogue from MD/LoM/RF or any other rogue in the zone to open the locked door for him, he run up the stairs, use track to find 8-9 mobs, tells a wandering enchater that is close by to Rune him so he will survive to train the courtyard.<br>
He then agro the 8-9 mobs, cast invis again, run back with the mobs to courtyard, execute a third unknown party program to make only the guildtag visable for everyone(since you can't tell the name of the druid), and then jump down to courtyard and train MD/LoM.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If this didn't happen, we didn't train. Your own guild did (or whomever was pulling)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What is the worst about it is you don't give a shit, if you cared you would be cool about it and own up to it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What is there to &quot;give a shit&quot; about? We didn't train anyone, nor did we do anything wrong. You want us to be sorry about your failure? That is taken care off already. I myself would love to see MD kill VS, since I know it would help them alot (even though I would like them to take care of it themselves) and I'm sorry they didn't manage this time, but I'm sure they will next....<br>
<br>
Save me your pitty in the future Xedd, you know nothing about our guild and I'm not going to let you throw shit on our guild like this when you know nothing about us.<br>

yes my responce was short, sweet and to the point. i was tring to convey the fact that its over and that everyone should go on with their lives, however, apparently you wish to debate this utterly stupid topic some more. WELL BITZ I GOT SOME WURDS FOR J00! <br>
&quot;Suk EET!&quot;<br>
<br>
anyways what happened, happened. it cannot be changed. i would have to say that Xedd and LoM were probably done a wrong. considering the few times i've delt with RF i've been displeased. i again say for your own sake and to keep yourselfs from looking more like foghats, just drop it, admit being incorrect, and end this thread. <br>
<br>
and another few words for that foghat who dared invoke my moronic and absolutly useless posts (ignore the top part, but the rest is relivant)<br>

Ok let me get this straight?<br>
<br>
1) You werent there and all you accused of of training from hearsay.<br>
2) Now you admit that you guys pulled VS.<br>
3) You guys got killed while pulling VS.<br>
4) RF was closest guild to you when you died.<br>
5) Of course its RF fault you died when pulling VS.<br>
6) Its so obvisous its RF fault (see 4).<br>
<br>
What was it again that we did wrong?<br>
<br>
Nah dont answer that, at this point its obvious that this is just a flame and nothing constructive. It should go to flame sections which I never read anyway. That would have saved us all a lot of time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Second, <br>
<br>
I would like everyone here to know a small fact that I have in my possesion.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time RF accidently left their message boards unsecured. Being the troll that I am, I decided to have a look at what RF is up to =)<br>
<br>
What did I find? Among other totally moronic things, I found that RF is discussing breaking ur Trak rotation.<br>
<br>
Now play with that for a while. Oh, and please try to protect your boards from hackers.<br>
<br>
Last thing, To recount the events that took place, all I know is this.<br>
<br>
All of LOM and MD was concentrating on mobs in front of us, was VS and 2 adds from the pull that were messed immediately<br>
<br>
Somehow, magicly 8 mobs snuck up from behind and all the sudden starting picking off the healers, and /w resulted in no more RF members. Where did they go? hmmmmm...... <p><CENTER><img src="http://www.legendofmarr.com/images/grulsig.jpg"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubalduk2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>balduk2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/19/01 5:25:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FYI </span><hr size=1> <br>

I am sure you were happy to read whatever was on our boards (guess I am not the only one bored sometimes) and hope you enjoyed it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
If you want more moronic stuff, dont worry, you dont need the passwords, just go to general section of our boards and read the thread called 'Tierra'. You will find the ultimate proof we are a bunch of morons, the purest breed of those even!<br>
<br>
As for the Trak rotation, we are on it and I have never seen any threads aboutr breaking it. Its been even discuss to get off it since the rewards arent that great anymore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Only thing I can think of, and something you obvisously dont know, is that the only way for us to get on the rotation was to prove we could kill Trak.<br>
<br>
 Let me think 2 secs...how can we kill TRak when were not on rotation...I am completely buggle...if were not on rotation we cant kill TRak...we must kill Trak to be on rotation...<br>
<br>
Woot! I got an idea...lets kill Trak anyway (thus breaking rotation) so we can be on rotation...<br>
<br>
Voila!<br>

I find it very amusing that you come here raising a huge shitstorm and then it turns out that you were mostly likely trained by someone from your own joint raid.. oooops!<br>

I suggest you try asking MD druid Wildroot exactly how it was she managed to die up on the ledge at the same time you were fighting VS in the courtyard.. And uhm.. where do you think those mobs that killed her went..<br>
