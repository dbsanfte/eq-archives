Lol, what involvement? Maybe you should reread the log. <br>
<br>
You mean that I gave him some platinum because I recognized his name? Maybe you should read the link....it is fundamental you know...reading....<br>
<br>
Since you are looking for some sort of proof, maybe you should piece together the scam that he is working on. Engratiating himself by mentioning some of the better known names and big guild names on the Rathe, basically looking for a partner to sucker in to thinking that doing this sort of thing is right.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for me to prove myself, you are looking in the wrong place. Meantime try not to be so first level and let me know if I need to use smaller words. <br>
<br>
PS. Didn't I read somewhere else that you &quot;aquired&quot; your account? Maybe you are they. <br>

On the other hand, noone is screwed over by Venok's statements. Blumkin is a great guy, Aiyanna wil come and CR you and bring everyone she knows to a botched raid to help out. People know these people. he is just trying to work his way in somewhere.<br>
<br>
As for helping him out, yes, I gave him a few plats. No good deed goes unpunished I guess. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

What a goober!  Yeah, someone who tries to cover their lack of education with a poor version &quot;l33t&quot; speak and spends their time trying to scam folks is someone I can't wait to group with ;p<br>
<br>
I hope he winds up dropping a bad tab that acid ahe's so proud of and it causes him to spend 3 days curled up in nude and in the fetal position while singing &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; ;p  Losers like that are what's wrong with the world today.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the heads-up on the waste of skin though =) <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260261>Barrd Talespinner</a>

<br>
Venok was the alt of Konev, guildleader of Gathering Shadows, which was around looong before any server split, or Kunark for that matter. <br>
<br>
Made? Hardly. Bought? Methinks yes.<br>
<br>
Anywho, thanks for the heads up..dought it helps as this moron has way too much time on his hands and I'm sure has too many giagtraders to name. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://mediaservice.photoisland.com/auction/Apr/20024174126658055580830.jpg"border="0"><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=187252>Pashun's Profile<a/><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=273372>Syntress<a/></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uwanlail.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wanlail</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/15/02 8:25:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=687.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sad</span><hr size=1> This guy is an @Sshole.... maybe a Gm will ban his ass so he can't do his &quot;gigatrading&quot;. <br>
