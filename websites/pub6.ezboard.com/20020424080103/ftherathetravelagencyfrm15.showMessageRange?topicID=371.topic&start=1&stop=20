<br>
I am also a member of the Safehouse.<br>
<br>
Both of these facts are relevant, as you will soon see.<br>
<br>
If you didn't know, the Safehouse is a EZBoard for the rogue class.  It is also the biggest EZBoard in existence.  It is also one of (or the) biggest class boards out there.<br>
<br>
We get tons of traffic... rogue regulars, people twinking rogues, people that have never played rogues, people that don't even play EverQuest.<br>
<br>
If you didn't know this either, somehow, because of no fault of our own, we managed to get a reputation for getting things 'nerfed' by Verant.<br>
<br>
This is totally unwarranted, and frankly, unbelievably and ludicrously idiotic.<br>
<br>
For the latest wave of 'Nerf!' criers, we have the rangers.  Rangers. My entire view of rangers, great rangers or the most shitty assholes out there, has been tainted because of these idiots.<br>
<br>
We had a nice new thread up in our Rant Hall today... it was titled &quot;The Nerfhouse&quot;.  It was by some @#%$ idiot ranger who decided to assume Verant, of course, being our puppets, 'nerfed' a ranger cloak from PoA because of us.<br>
<br>
(Editted out personal attack 'cuz it was idiotic and in the heat of the moment.)<br>
<br>
Anybody that thinks the Safehouse gets things nerfed over at Verant HQ probably needs to rethink their position.  In fact, anyone who thinks the Safehouse or any board is responsible for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> every</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> nerf or <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> every</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> change Verant has ever made really needs to rethink their position.  There have been some instances, such as monk FD, where a board really did influence Verant, but it's not that often, yet somehow the Safehouse always gets blamed for these nerfs.<br>
<br>
Frankly, this is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard pertaining to this game (and one of the most idiotic things I've ever heard in my life).<br>
<br>
This reputation that the Safehouse has gained has no grounding at all.<br>
<br>
We are a rogue board.  We are for the rogue class.  I'm sure even you ranger people can figure this out.  We didn't complain when other classes began to arrive at our doorstep.  We gave away information and all was well.  Eventually, assholes began to come.  They wanted information and they wanted it speedily, with no 'if's, 'and's, or 'but's.  We are not your bitches, thanks.<br>
<br>
Somehow, people began to use the boards for more than rogue discussions... other classes came up.  This was bound to make trouble.<br>
<br>
So, somehow, we started to get blamed for 'nerf's of other classes.  It makes no sense.  It has no basis.<br>
<br>
The only member of Verant that has ever visited our boards is Grandaddy Rogue, Kendrick.  He doesn't even work at Verant anymore.  How in the hell can we be responsible for this recent 'nerf'?  And we were never responsible for nerfs in the past!<br>
<br>
The connection between other uninvited (but still welcomed) classes posting and discussing on our boards and possible nerfs of said classes makes absolutely no sense, and frankly, I would expect more from a @#%$ five year old.  (Editted out personal attack... see reason above.)<br>
<br>
Hmmm... we didn't invite you, but we didn't push you away.  And you blame us for your troubles.  It makes no sense, and frankly, it's very rude and we don't appreciate it.  We help you, you are rude to us.  Rethink your actions and maybe I'd be more welcoming.<br>
<br>
In any case... frankly, this is just plain stupid.  How people arrive at point Idiotic Conclusion from point A reminds me of the &quot;Jumping to Conclusions&quot; mat from Office Space.  Except make this mat the size of a football field and you can see how far you would have to jump to make this assumption.<br>
<br>
Is that what you think when you think Safehouse?...<br>
<br>
&quot;Haha, so, Fellow Nazi Glip, do you like our latest ranger nerf?  We gave paladins uber-clickiness on their SoulFires but removed uber-clickiness on the ranger cloaks!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Har har, good job, Fellow Nazi Gyorg!  Now we just need to remove ranger's SoW, thorns, and all haste items... Yes, that should do it!&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, yes, look at us, we are the Safehouse, we have ultra power and sleepers all over the Verant offices influencing the decisions up at the headquarters!  Wu ha ha!  You are all fools!<br>
<br>
You know, we might just have you rangers nerfed even more for you telling us how we are getting Verant to nerf you!  We don't like people knowing our plans!<br>
<br>
I have an idea!  We will nerf yet another of your abilities... this time we're going to remove... hmmmmm... Feign Death!  Yes, Feign Death!<br>
<br>
&quot;Feign Death?!&quot; you say!  &quot;But we don't even have that in our spell lists!&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, duh, my exact point!  We love nerfing things you don't even have yet!  It is our ultimate pleasure!  You enjoy tree-hugging... we enjoy pre-nerfs!  It's like pre-movies... out for home purchase before they're even finished!  Pre-nerfs... nerfed before you ever even had it!<br>
<br>
In case you didn't understand, I was being sarcastic.  To quote one of the rangers that posted in the most recent 'The Nerfhouse' thread...<br>
<br>
&quot;Once upon a time, I had triple attack...&quot;<br>
<br>
No, you didn't, you dumbass.  You never had it.  Verant was testing it... TESTING.  You did not have it.  Verant tested it, decided they didn't like the damage output, and never put it live.<br>
<br>
You did not have it.  You can not lose something you didn't have.  You, again, need to rethink your conclusion.<br>
<br>
You come to our boards.  We welcome you, we help you, we open our arms to you.  You blame us for your troubles and cry 'Nerf!'  It is rude and unwarranted.  We would be a lot more helpful if you would stop asking for our help and then blaming us for your troubles. <p>Houseless Rake of 52 Jests<br><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">Safehouse,</a> Ring Warden of The Rathe</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utrolojesterkinng.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trolo Jesterkinng</A> at: 1/26/02 2:59:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uslinkity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slinkity</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Slinkity/fullsize/technoinside.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(1/24/02 4:28:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Slinkity/fullsize/technoinside.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Scream 'Nerf', Bitch!</span><hr size=1> Glad I'm not a Ranger..=) <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52121><br>Slinkity<br>59 Beguiler</a>

Get a @#%$ life.  Your whole post is so damn pathetic.  You don't think boards are responsible for getting things changed?  Get a clue.  Verant members read boards.  HTF do you know if a verant member is on your board or not?  You are the biggest EZBoard out there, no?  So you have tons of traffic..do you go through each name and see if it is a Verant representative?  If you think those massive threads and complaints on your board, which stimulate people to send /reports and /petitions in daily don't help to get anything changed, you really are blind.  <br>
<br>
Now, personally I don't think people bitching at boards for something getting changed is right, and I think its rather stupid.  Rangers for bitching about this is rather stupid, but if you think your board, or every big board out there has no effect on Verant, again, you are wrong.  I like the Safehouse, I visit there often, so this is nothing against the board, my post is just about how lame you are for wishing death in real life to someone you don't know *at all* just because they posted something on your board.  <br>

Example: IIRC, there was a lowbie rogue who went ballistic over the original version of the rogue dagger that drops from Vulak claiming overpowering and such.  That dagger was nerfed.  A while later, VI looked over it again and made it better than it was before.<br>
<br>
SafeHouse has a reputation of having lots of whingers who post there, mostly people who haven't a clue about what they are posting - like level 12 players who have never killed anything stronger than a dervish ranting about high-end game encounters that they never have seen, and probably never will. <p><p><P>

<br>
Betcha people read those boards. Betcha Verant people read those boards. Betcha even if 99.99% of you guys over there didn't give a rats a'ss about the ranger nerf, the rogue dagger that was nerfed and unnerfed, or any other item that were complained about and coincidentally nerfed, you cannot say that there is 100% no blame to you.<br>
<br>
It would be really ignorant to say &quot;oh, we have the biggest boards and a lot of traffic, but no one other than the actual PLAYERS reads them&quot;. Hell, you said yourself that people that don't even play the game read the boards. You have to agree that it's probable that the developers might take a look through them from time to time under (bear with me now) accounts that don't actually use their real names... <br>
<br>
So, if your moderators are going to be fine with &quot;Nerf class X posts&quot; or even &quot;oh man, this is so overpowered, look at this&quot; posts, you're going to get the backlash that comes with it. <br>
