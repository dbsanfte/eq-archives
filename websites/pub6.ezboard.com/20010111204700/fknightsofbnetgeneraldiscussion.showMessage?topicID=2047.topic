My name is Aslan_theLion. I play on both USeast and USwest on B.net. I am an apprentice in The Holy Knights of Westmarch. Although i am a new member, I have been very active within my guild. Because of this, I have noted That many of my new friends, and some of the best people i have met in ANY game, were Concerned that such a valuable ally as KoB was possibly turning away from DiabloII.<br>
     <br>
I have read through the public forum and found many members of KoB are &quot;burnt-out&quot; on DII while many are still actively enjoying DII. This is almost ironic to me because I was in the exact opposite position many of you are in now. I came from Everquest to Diablo II...<br>
<br>
A little bit about myself. I have been playing Online RPG's since 1992 (and pen and paper rpg's since 1981)<br>
Some games include Sierra's &quot;the imagination Network: the shadow of Yserbius&quot;, AOL's (original) Neverwinter Nights, Sierra's &quot;The Realm&quot;, Ulitima Online,Empirana, and finally Everquest.<br>
<br>
My concern is that many may be turning to Everquest without knowing the full facts. I would like to present them to you all for your discussion. What makes me an authority on EQ? I played Everquest from it's inception to it's latest Expansion(just cut short from joining betatesters) . About a year and a half roughly. I have played just about every character and race class combination available. My main character Is a LV 55 Cleric (max lv is 60) Valimar Deathbane who is in full Plane gear and before that was in full rubicite armor. I played On E'CI server. I also was a Guide (customer service volunteer for verant) for many months on Rodcet Nife Server.<br>
<br>
So, yes i consider myself an expert on everquest as there is most probably no quest/raid/zone/uber-mob-god-dragon I have not been in or helped to kill(with the exception of Veeshan/Veeshan's peak). My character has over 160 days /played and started out un-twinked/un-gimped/ never helped.<br>
<br>
So what was it about EQ that broke me after so long of playing? Ironically enough, many of the reasons some of you have already stated about DII. Monotony, lack of interest, bad experiences, frustrated with limitations of the game.<br>
<br>
My point to many of you is this: those of you seeking to find a new game to play thinking that EQ will solve the problems of stagnation in gameplay may be in for a disappointment. EQ in my opinion will, over time be even more monotonous to you and this will be worse because you will be paying for it.<br>
<br>
I am in no way bitter about verant but then again i am in no-way their biggest fan even though I was one of thier guides!<br>
<br>
Let me get to some examples. Everquest like any other game may be exciting at first, but you will quickly find a drastic difference than what you may be used to with Diablo II. That is..it is a social game. Some characters MUST group with others in order to survive. And this prospect does not get better with levels, on the contrary, the problem becomes compounded. E.G. Lv 34 ranger decides to gain experience by hunting in lower Guk dungeon, solo. Ranger so-and-so decides he wants to try and get himself an executioners axe for a warrior friend. Ranger so-and-so dies a horrible death from greater ice-bones because he did not group with a paladin or cleric who could have casted &quot;invisibility to undead&quot;. Change the class/circumstance of this example and it can be applied to any area of the game.<br>
<br>
It doesn't end there.<br>
Let's say you've reached the gauntlet. You're a lv 45  (any class) and you've decided it's off to the shores of kunark(expansion) for the likes of you to find more items, more adventure, more glory. Or perhaps you just want to get yourself your plane gear from the planes of hate or fear...or kill a god! Well, although all the items and equipment that you have gathered thus far is good and has been hard to get, it really only took a group of six people to achieve them. Just you and a couple of friends..Now however any items that are worthwhile require that you take part in a RAID. That is, a zone so dangerous it requires a MASSIVE amounts of people to &quot;break&quot; the zone or make it accessible/playable for everyone to hunt monsters. If it's a PUBLIC raid, where anyone can join, First Post on many forums/boards that you want to join some days before, and post EARLY or 10 ppl will be ahead of you and the raid leaders only needed 2 more to begin with! Then if you make it...expect to be a part of a LOOT RULE system put in placed by your fellow Class &quot;peers&quot;. You didn't vote on any loot rule you say? Sorry! That doesn't make a difference, the rules are in place. Sure you may die many times, But we(your peers) have decided those who have played the longest should get the items/equipment they need first. THEN MAYBE you can get something.<br>
If it's a GUILD or PRIVATE raid...well the old adage comes into play, &quot;It's not what you know but who you know&quot; Hope you have a friend in a high position within that guild. If you don't well you're at the tender mercies of the public raid system. I won't even go into how massive guilds have monopolized certain zones/planes/Kunark. Suffice to say if you are a casual gamer...you can expect never to gain elite items within the game. The very nature of the gameplay excludes casual gamers from some of the best experiences EQ can offer. And if you are a serious gamer, like I/others were, expect to put your time in. Whatever grievances you may have with diablo II, at least your character is not limited in what he/she can achieve based on how much you can play!! Marriages have been ruined because of people refusing to let go of this game. You say &quot;that can happen anywhere/anygame&quot; ok, but no game forces you to put in overtime like EQ does...i guarantee it...<br>
<br>
This leads into my next point. CAMPING. How do people spend so much time in EQ? Well you are all intelligent and honorable folk. I'm sure you can see the business motivation behind EQ's layout right? Bottom line, the game is designed so that people HAVE to play for many hours consistently in order to achieve that next level/item. The more they play, they more they pay!!  Diablo II is a godsend in that items are dropped RANDOMLY from any monster!! Magical/rare/unique...Anything! hell, you can even imbue/make an item! you can GAMBLE for an item!<br>
Not so in everquest my friends. E.G you're a happy go lucky Paladin! it's time to get the best sword for any paladin under lv 35! Ghoulbane!! ok...get thee to upper guk dungeon! Join a group! since only the Froglock Lord drops this weapon you have to stay in that area, kill everything that spawns there (mobs spawn/or appear magically in a certain spot periodically to ensure a steady rotation of mobs) until the Lord Drops your Ghoulbane! First 4 hours place holders spawn and not the lord, hour 5 Lord spawns but drops Silver plated bracer his common drop not his RARE drop, the sword, hour 8 Lord Spawns! but the Wizard who joined the group before you gets the sword because he wants it for his &quot;secondary character&quot; hour 12 Lord Is killed by &quot;damage over time&quot; spell cast by Druid and the lord drops nothing because this spell causes the monster to disappear dropping no items because of a bug. (That verant has not addressed yet) Hour 16 Lord drops another bracer...Get the idea? lather, rinse, repeat. Want to talk about monotony? spend 2 days straight at the computer without any break waiting for that &quot;special&quot; item that you need...to survive! Playing in the same area, killing the same monsters over and over and over. In some circumstances...The monsters may not even give you experience for killing them!!!!!! <br>
<br>
Quests? Some..are worthwhile but others give so little experience...or the rewards are so little they are just impractical<br>
<br>
Let me try to sum this up as it seems it has taken up alot of room. Everquest may be larger than DII but all that becomes moot. Once you have gotten to a certain point in EQ...it's always the same thing. Every zone/area looks the same...every quest is the same... Never any surprise. even a lv 85 barbarian...can STILL get a better sword..War boots...anything! if the circumstances are right! no two rares are the same. You can gamble for that stone of jordan! EQ uber-item = get in an uber-guild that monopolizes or get on a waiting list just to get on a class waiting list for a public raid. It's just ridiculous.<br>
or..camp for hours on end to get that nice sword/robe/armor. (see why casual gamers are at a disadvantage?)<br>
<br>
The subject of verant NERFING (deliberately crippling a magic item/or spell or...character class) is a whole other issue. Sure Ver 1.03 nerfed some Whirlwind, corpse explosion and more...but did it do anything to any items? Imagine you just got wormskull. Blizzard decides that This unique is TOO powerful so...it takes away  1 to necro skills from it. how about that? well never happens in DII but you can expect it...frequently in everquest... And i mean almost every patch. some changes are not even announced!!!!<br>
<br>
I'll leave it at that. For me Everquest was too political. Too time consuming. Too frustrating. There are many more reasons/examples/experiences i can give but in the end, each person will hold their own council. However I ask all of you to keep your DII accounts active, and play with your fellow guildmembers or even allies! Because after some time in Everquest...you may be back to Diablo II or anything else for that matter, before you know it. <br>
<br>
If any of you wish to contact me for any reason my account name is: Valimar77 icq 18984501. I know I speak for all my fellow knights at HKW when I say I hope you all will still play DII and we hope to hear from you soon. Take care trusted allies and be well.<br>

However, I think several people have misconceptions.  I can only speak for myself.  I have recently discovered that perhaps I am not bored of D2.  Perhaps, I am just way over Battle.net.  I just killed D on normal with my level 28 necro and have gone about halfway into act 1 of nightmare and am jazzed.  This is on open.  I can actually PLAY the game with out getting disconnected or bounced or whatever.  And am having quite a bit of fun doing it.  Now, on to your opinion.  I just wanted to say thank you for spending your time on that post.  I don't really have much to say about it one way or the other as I haven't played that much yet.  I do have one thing I would like you to clarify if you could however.  You said:<br>
<br>
Bottom line, the game is designed so that people HAVE to play for many hours consistently in order to achieve that next level/item. The more they play, they more they pay!!<br>
<br>
  How is that.  Its 10.00 no matter how much you play correct?<br>
<br>
  On a different note, I went and visited your forum the other day and checked out the page again, its been awhile for me.  Things are look like they are going very well for you guys, congrats!<br>
<br>
Peace<br>

I have not had the oppourtunity to get involved with it <br>
to the level you have been..<br>
I really agree with you about the excessive time commitment..the time vs rewards is kinda skewed in my book.<br>
Also I have already seen some of the guild/ interplayer<br>
politics at play does not look to be a pretty thing.<br>
Guess it is just human nature to take things way too seriously.<br>

Let me expound on this statement...<br>
Yes, it is only 10$ a month..(not including the charges presented for buying the epansion if you wish to level beyond lv 50 and play in Kunark)<br>
However, the game mechanics are such, that they are made...to ensure, you keep on paying that 10$ every month. It's made so that most players keep an active intrest in the game and do not cancel thier account. So the profit margin is long term. I can see your viewpoint. 10$ dosen't seem like alot right? check the server split notifications and requests...Some servers log more than 2400 at prime time severely lagging the game. massive amounts of people play this game everyday...continually which is the key. Multiply 2000+ people paying 10$ each. What monetary figure do you come up with? Now multiply your initial figure by 20+ servers currently in use....That is big money. So again we return to the basics. More play more pay. There is always the next item to reach for...<br>
<br>
Personally i never had much of a problem with this but when I finally Got my Etheral mist (cleric breastplate) armor from hate I thought I had reached a status quo. But when Verant added a policy where all spellcaster spells (including clerics) above lv 50 had to found as drops off of monsters, that drew a line in the sand with me. &quot;Sure my armor comes from another plane of existance...ok there is better AC (dr) armor out there now you say?  Ok i suppose i'll have to find a raid to try and get some again. Ok..Now the spells That I need to play have to be found on monsters?&quot; it sorta never ends. An analogy I use is A mule being led my a carrot dangling from a stick tied to it's harness. in such a way, Verant strings along it's customers making sure they keep playing because they are never satisfied. Everyone plays, everyone pays 10$, Verant/sony is doing very well.<br>
<br>
Again this is a rather long reply but I hope it answered your question.<br>
Thanks Again<br>

As far as my general outlook on your post/statements/argument (it's an argument by definition!), I've been there myself.  I've seen online game item nerfing, class nerfing (no this isn't just D2 I'm speaking of having experience about :P ).  I've even experienced it myself, heh.  But strangely I didn't care.  I must be more forgiving or adapatable than others (the power freaks? ;)<br>
<br>
Anywho, yeah I can more than understand the point of difference between EverQuest and Diablo II, but I've always been one to prefer MMORPGs like EverQuest (product of MUDding?), and the ability to add on to things like EverQuest and make it a BIG add-on as well always had a place in my heart... <br>
<br>

The game is geared so that you will play for a long period of time and keep paying the $10 a month.  My thoughts are, as long as the game is keeping people playing, its keeping it fun.  Again, I haven't really started playing to much, and I can see where a person builds a character so high, and has so much invested in him/her that it could almost seem like you can't stop.  I imagine it would get like that.  Altho, from what I have seen and from what ppl have told me, lag is pretty much non-existant.  I could only imagine that is a direct result of the money that is being spent monthly.  Bandwidth cost $$.  Of course, they are surely making a profit in the meantime.  The d2 X pack is due for release first part of next year, I for one will probably pre-order that as well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and spend the extra money for a collectors edition if they have that.  I would gladly pay Blizz $10 a month if their servers farms were top notch and if they could kill the bandwidth problems.  Heck, I still play D1 from time to time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyway, I do appreciate your comments.

Thank you for replying!<br>
It sure will help you if you use that &quot;forgiving nature&quot; when you play everquest. I can certainly understand that some people will play no matter what information is presented. Moreso, if it is fun for you I encourage you to play EQ!<br>
I only present certain facts for your (and the whole of KoB's) edification, in the hopes that it may keep you involved in DiabloII. Your Allies in HKW have not forgotten you.<br>
As for the fact that perhaps only the &quot;power freaks&quot; may care for the information I presented, you may feel differently after you hit some mid levels or even certain dungeons in no time at all.<br>
<br>
Here's a point that will even interest you and all the other &quot;non-powerfreaks&quot; Crowding/Killstealing. Unlike Diablo II everquest has 1 game everybody plays on at the same time. Not just 8 people, but sometimes 2400+ as we pointed out. You're a lv 16 enchanter trying to get some xp so you you head to the aviak village in south Karana. Plentiful, no faction hits, a sure thing you think to yourself. When you get there it's a madhouse, the penthouse is camped, there are groups camping every rook spawn and up. You find a nice rook nobody seems to have noticed and you cast your fire spell, just as you do, you see the rook fall down dead to someone else's spell. A wolf (druid) comes to the corpse and loots the body. You scream to him/her that you were attacking first and no response....<br>
Still think only power freaks will be affected?<br>
<br>
<br>
You pack your bags and decide to go to Najena in lavastorm. You've been wearing that gossimer robe for too long! it's time for a sleek flowing black robe and that means taking on Najena herself. So you make the loooong trek from south Karana to lavastorm, almost dieing in Beholder/the gorge thanks to a roving evil eye. At last Najena! first you camp the ogre captain for his key. Then Bonecracker the undead froglock for his bone key. Head to the necromancer Rathyl and his minions. This takes a few hours and you die a couple of times because the warrior didn't taunt or the cleric didn't heal in your party. Then it's off to Drelzna. This shadowknight is particularly nasty as her harmtouch kills the warrior almost straight out in the battle. Finally you have what you need, the key for Najena! off you go! you get there and..Wulfen the lv 53 shaman is camping her. you ask if he will let you get the next robe, he says No because he needs it for his daughter/wife/girlfriend/cousin/trade fodder/just because... Will he share? no <br>
<br>
Still think only &quot;power freaks&quot; will care? all this may seem abstract to you, but sooner or later you will fall into one of these experiences. Perhaps you'll shrug it off, just as we all have in EQ, but when it happens again and again...there will be no ignoring it and you just might have to face that it is fustrating for everyone..not just &quot;power freaks&quot;<br>
<br>
Have fun And be well =)<br>

<br>
I dont know what to reply to this post but I think you talk against yourself and not being very objective.<br>
<br>
You say that the game are not fun and yet you have played the game for 160 days. I mean 160 days is 3840 hours and you spent so much time on game that you didnt like. To me that is very amazing.<br>
<br>
About the armour you say you spend alot of time to get the lates armour for your character. Then Vernat puts in a new better set of armour that you can go after. To me this sounds like fun since there is always something else and new to look forward to and the game does not get boring.<br>
<br>
Also you say that all the quests seem the same wich I do not agree with and you also say that its all about getting the latest item and level wich I absolutely dont think. What it is all about is to play the game and have fun.<br>
I think its fun to hang around and help newbies and just run around talking to people. I know some people who can't rest until they have played for 24hours and gotten that special item but that is theirs problem not mine if they chose to do so and if that is what they value in the game.<br>
<br>
Another aspect is that in order to know whats fun and get that special feeling for your character you need to feel the oposite aswell. Thats why EQ is so great I think since it can make you so so so  mad and frustrated but lets say you do take 2 hours to go try kill the ghoul lord in upper guk for the ghoulbane sword and the sword actually drops and the group you are in lotto the item wich the way usually is on the server we play on. And lets say you win the lotto and get this sword you will feel so so so happy you will smile all weekend since you know how rare it is and so on, no other game can make you feel like that. In Diablo2 you get a good item since something on the server randomized that a good item was going to drop. How can you even compare that to how you described the adventure of getting the FBR. When I did that quest, adventure or what ever its called it was my best experience ever, well one of them. Sure some people die but would it be fun if you could just go in and grab the robe like in a supermarket. Also thanks for putting in all the info and spoilers for those who actually wanted to go there someday. And about that shammy 53 who was camping it I am sure he will gladly let you know that he is there if you do a shout when you enter the place where you ask if someone is going for the robe. It can actually be another adventuring group there, it doesnt have to be a shammy 53. If thats the case there are alot of other things to kill in Najena instead.<br>
<br>
Also what I dont get is how you can look down so much on the game since all that you describe to me sounds like fun.<br>
You talk about the money they make but do you talk about all the things they do with the money with new enhancements every patches and so on ?<br>
<br>
If I buy a game and it makes me play it for 160 days before I trun bored of it like you that is to me a pretty good game. Some games offer like 30 hours of gameplay to beat it and then it should get boring, kinda like BG or some other game of that type with an ending. You spent freaking 3840 hours infront of EQ before you got bored and is that then not a good game ?<br>
<br>
It sounds to me that you have taken EQ to damn serious and gotten very affected that you could not acuire the highest levels and the best of the best items and when you realized that you got bored and left the game.<br>
<br>
But I can tell you that that is the beuty of EQ, its like a real world. Not every one can be the President and not every one can have the best kick ass sword of the dragon what ever super duper swords there are. If all had them where would the prestige go ?<br>
<br>
And another thing is that I agree that the Uber guilds have control of alot of the high end stuff so why dont create an own uber guilds while you get that high or why dont you simply join one of the existing ?<br>
<br>
What is so wrong with that ?<br>
<br>
In real life the country with the best armies will win a war. In EQ the guilds with the best players will kill most dragons and gods, is that wrong ?<br>
<br>
I think ofcourse they want you to play the game long term to make cash but in order to achive that they have to keep the game fun and I think they make a great job of that.<br>
<br>
I have a lvl 49 wizard in a very great guild and I have played the game since it came out and I have had my breaks from it from time to time but I have always come back to the game after I got bored on other games and Diablo2 was one of them I got bored of. Killing Diablo for the hundred time in less than 1 minute is not anything I would like to compare to an event where you are out to kill a god wich you and your guild has planned weeks ahead and the raid itself will take lets say around 12 hours and you have had plenty of time to tell your girlfriend and who ever might care that saturday night you will be playing EQ and thats it. After those 12 hours you will be very very happy you and your best of friends that you play with have killed the god or you will be very very sad that you and your friends that you play with have all deid and failed in the atempt to kill the god. If you win you will be happy if you get some of the loot wich should be evenly devded amongst the people who havent looted in a long time and you will be proud to wear that kick ass item and people will let you know they think it looks cool aswell. If you fail the kill you will only want to get back up there for another chance wich might take some time since the other guilds also need to have their go on him. Its called a rotation of the uber spawns so that all get to enyoy them wich we have on our server.<br>
<br>
Well enough of me and sorry for the long post.<br>
I just didnt feel your post was very objective, it was more a post where you want people to think bad of the game.<br>
<br>
Why dont explain why you spent the 160 to start of with ?<br>
<br>

About the crowded spots in EQ, if you have a real problem with finding a place to hunt for your level I will be very happy to show you hundreds of places you can go where you wont see a person anyway you look.<br>
<br>
With another expansion coming up I fear that some places will be forgotten and never visited at all exept by the people who learnt about those places with their higher characters and ofcourse those low level newbies who actually roleplay and adventure and do find these places by themself.<br>
<br>
Well just ask if you have a problem.<br>
Asking is not really to spoil the fun about finding it by yourself since knowing where to go is nothing compared to actually getting there.<br>

I made no pretense that i wasn't hooked on the game, obviously i was but you are providing some really weak arguments for EQ. As far as providing a spoiler for EQ quests? Get real. There are hundereds of sites that post spoilers and Najena isn't exactly a &quot;Hot spot&quot; for adventurers any more. You have a lv 49 Wizard? Kudos to you! Want to join an uber guild? Good for you! Staying in game because of friends? That's why i stayed as long as i did. Think my viewpoint is wrong? go ahead and post on a public forum and see the opinions you get. You really think A high level camper is going to give up his spawn when he is farming so a lower level can get his item? That's not very realistic LOL I don't know what server you play on or what utopia you live in either. Think Uber-guilds aren't a problem? Look at Fires of heaven and the server wars on there or Souls of the shadow on eci. You never camped the ghoul magi in lower guk for a shimmering metallic robe? how much time did you spend there bud? You're still going to tell me camping isn't monotonous? or maybe you bought one on e-bay or traded for it? I don't know your situation so i can't say.<br>
<br>
You sound VERY self-rightous saying that you help newbies and are there for your friends. You think i never did the same? LOL i spent hours in blackburrow killing trains and giving away items when the game was at a standstill before kunark and i was lv 50. I travelled across whole continents and zones to ressurect people for thier experience.<br>
<br>
I think you're in denial. If you really are lv 49 then i know you've gone through the problems of Killstealing/camping/farming/class limitiations. Maybe you're so angry because i hit a nerve somewhere? made a point that hit a little bit too close to home??? You tell me to ask myself some questions. Well I'll respond by telling you to look at yourself. if it's just a game..what are you so angry about? LOL especially when all i am doing is providing my perspective on a game. And if you look at the majority of the responses here most people were GLAD I gave some insight into EQ. At the very least many say it was &quot;thought provoking&quot; Well in your case i can see what it provoked, anger. Loosen up. I'm an ALLIED MEMBER of your guild. Not an enemy.<br>
<br>
Be well in your travels.<br>

I play on Karana where the guilds that do have the power to take on gods and dragons live in peace and have them on rotation so it gets fun for every one.<br>
<br>
For your information I probably spent some hours camping the magi but never had the luck to get one of the SMRs allthough I could go buy the robe any time I want I am very happy with my robe of the Oracle and really dont care about the SMR, if I get it I will be very happy but I wont spend endless days camping it till I get it.<br>
<br>
I think some of us forget that its just a game, and still if a game makes you play it for 160 days it cant be all eveil. That is why I feel you are not so very objective.<br>
<br>
Sure friends want you to stay and play but isnt that the point in a multiplayer game, that you play together and make frieds ? What is bad with that ?<br>
<br>
Only time EQ gets bad is when you want all and cant get it in terms of levels and items. If you have this desire in real life that you want all you will soon know that its not going to happen. Think about EQ the same way and it all makes sence, after all its just a game.<br>

Your reply while tame when compared to your other two fail to address many of the issues i brought up regarding everquest. It sounds more like a desperate political spin not unlike some of the commercials being run on american airwaves by politicians running for office today. Don't focus on the issues but attack the opponent on a personal level, undermining the message. This is sad because this thread started out as a well intentioned, well thought out post designed to educate and inform people about some aspects of the game they may not have known or taken into consideration. And the Flames have turned it now into something people rather not see or even discuss. It's a dead thread so I will sadly end it here.<br>
<br>
Instead of thinking things through like the issues you assume/judge certain things about me. And the only things i hear are 160 days, 160 days. Then if that's not enough you try and elude to how I might act in real life when compared to game experiences. Quite a jump you made there.<br>
<br>
Next time before you judge try and take in all the facts. Why 160 days? Not objective? Ever think if the person was disabled for some reason? There are more players out there like that than you realize unable to take part in day to day activities which you take for granted.<br>
<br>
I am a loyal person to a fault. I take up challenge and follow through the course. When i joined EQ it was because of the Guild I was in. I won't mention the name because it's still active. However I was a council member in that guild. I picked the cleric class instead of Paladin because the guild needed a cleric and i responded. I supported the guildmistress who put time, energy and money into her guild always striving to make it better. How could I not follow suit? I organized and ran guild hunt events. I ran team-player/tactics events. Organized alliances with other guilds. Recruited new members. Ran newbie events in Qeynos and freeport. Assisted casual gamers within my guild by providing one-on-one level assistance. Did research on game mechanics to provide guild members with a better playing experience. And if that wasn't enough I joined the guide program working at least 10 hours a week to work customer service and answer petitions. If you can't be &quot;objective&quot; while being a guide I'm not sure how you can be one. So i still don't understand how you can accuse me of not being objective in my views. As i said before &quot;if EQ is fun for you, go ahead and play&quot;<br>
<br>
     No other games were even worth playing in my opinion. Not asherons Call or Ultima online. But I was waiting for one.When one did come out (DiabloII) I finally left because by that time I retired from the guild. Before that time though many times I almost quit the game, but i would receive a phone call urging me back to my guild responsibilities. 160 days? That was a sacrifice. I stayed because of the people and my guild. Not as you insinuate because of levels and items. And touching on that, some items in EQ are a neccesity if you want to survive, especially to certain classes. They are not things you can &quot;want&quot; and still live without. When was the last time you saw a warrior who was main tank in a Fear/Hate raid that was only wearing platemail? How many do you see not wearing thier plane armor or cobalt armor?<br>
<br>
I'll ask you again also. If it's just a game why did you respond with an angry post? It seems Hypocritical to me that you use &quot;it's just a game&quot; as your Political Ad slogan. Why not make a bumpersticker saying &quot;it's just a game&quot; and slap it onto the back of your car?<br>
<br>
I suggest you take stock of what you say and who you say it about before you post. Assuming things about people and making accusations and judging them is really not the way to go. Of course if you don't care about any of this, make snap judgements and blast your unrefined opinions just because you &quot;can&quot; and you feel like it, by all means, Flame away. However This will be the last time I post on this thread or on this forum.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you and if you wish to contact HKW do it through Commander Lufthanz our official Liason.<br>

<br>
You say I attack you personal ?<br>
I am very sorry if you feel it that way but go back and read your posts and see what you did to me. That was very weak to say that of you.<br>
<br>
I also feel that it is good that you bring up things about Everquest that might not be very grea but also you forget about the things that might is good. Also when a player plays Everquest there is a choice where the player can choose to do stuff and if they think that an item is very needed than they go after it and if they think that its not needed compared to the time it takes to get it they will most comonly deal with it and dont try and waiste the time getting the item or they will start thinking that the item is so great that they must have it since it is so hard to get and they will get very frustrated when they cant get it kinda like a little kid wanting ice cream and won't have it.<br>
<br>
It's a personal choice and if you read on EQ home site it says that its a game about long time character development.<br>
That says it all I think.<br>
<br>
Also I feel that it is a very weak answer to say that you spent 160 days playing a game that only made you frustrated since of friends in your guild wanted you to?<br>
<br>
Would you clean their homes aswell if they wanted you to ?<br>
<br>
I still dont think you are objective at all and if you want to hear my opinion on some (note some) of the guides I do not like them since I believe that some of them are only there to be able to feel power and see all the parts of the world safe. I do not knoew if you fall in this category and to be true I do not care.<br>
<br>
I like EQ and you do not obviously.<br>
By facts they are soon to have 300000 active subscribers and the figures are still going up. They have a 90%+ something figure of the players that tried their first month still plays.<br>
<br>
If you  ask me I really like the discussion with you and fell sorry you are not going to keep posting. Sigh, I miss the days when me and Lucifer could go on forever like this.<br>
Can you put down one good thing about EQ though and I can admit one thing I dont like too, nothing is perfect and I agrees that taking the boats sucks.<br>

People with diverse and different views on a topic can create some of the best reads in a forum. I must say that usually long  posts get skipped when it comes to reading them. But in the case of this thread I have enjoyed reading every last word. It is a shame that Asian thinks Onehouse's views are personal attacks on him, when you have disagreement..you will have words that seem like personal attacks.<br>
<br>
My take on the D2 vs EQ subject.<br>
<br>
I have played multiplayer online games a long time. My first commercial version being Dragons Gate on Genie which was a text only game. I got to know alot of friends there and had the time of my life. I have been playing D&amp;D related games since 1978 and continue to play them today.<br>
<br>
I purchased Everquest over a year ago and played alot in the first month or so. Then unfortunately I lost interest in the game.  I had played everynight and had not met any friends at all.  I am not anti-social and I tried to create relationships with people.  Everquests vastness made that very difficult. A newbie character has a VERY limited area in which they can play to start off.  Alot of people helped me out with my new character but I didnt create any long time friendships. So...my interest faded.<br>
<br>
I have now returned to EQ with my guildmates from the KOB. And I can honestly say that I am enjoying the game more then ever.  I have travelled to areas that I had never even seen in the months that I had played before. I talk with friends and fight side by side with guildmates.  Its a great experience.<br>
<br>
The game itself is an ever-evolving world that is a joy to watch and be a part of. If some dont like it anymore for whatever their reason...so be it.  But...I think everyone who enjoys being part of a diverse environment and likes to create a personality and interact with people...should give EQ a try. You might not like EQ...but I for one believe that EQ lets a person create a character and roleplay that character 10 times more then D2.  If you want to just hack and slash and gain levels...then D2 is your game.  If you want more...then try EQ.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion.<br>
Take care!<br>

You know what's funny?  I have been playing a Necro on open and my interest in D2 is back at a fevered pitch <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I just started a necro on bnet, character Dragamel-KoB.  I joined a game, found Pretender and gave him a BUNCH of stuff, lol.  He gave me some stuff to sell.  So now, I am a level 1 necro with over 17k, about 20 full health potions and the cube, the eye, the brain, muahaha.  I didnt take my necro out yet, as the 2nd half of the RAMS!!! game was over and the only way I can enjoy it here is to listen to it on the net.  I live in Atlanta and they pre-empted the FOX broadcast for the Falcons.  Last I looked at that it was like 41-7..  Oh well... anyway, I bought EQ and got an acct, but really haven't played that much.  I think maybe I was getting bored with my level 38 barb, not neccessarily with the game itself.  Anyhow, after the game is over, I'll be on bnet, levelling that necro.  Any of you that have stuffs for a Necro that you can't use...  &lt;hint, hint...  nudge,nudge...&gt; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Oh and Velvetman, if you are reading this, FIND ME!!!  I got a killer set of armor for you!!  860 def I think, 180 STR req.<br>
