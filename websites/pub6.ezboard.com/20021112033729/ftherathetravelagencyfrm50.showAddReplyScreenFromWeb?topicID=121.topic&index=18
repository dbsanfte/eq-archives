When only 2 (or perhaps 3) guilds are able to kill a certain creature, then a &quot;Gentlemen's Agreement&quot; seems adequate.  Really, only they know what is involved in killing the creature (and his cohorts, if any).  This also has the perk of letting them work out the nuances of this particular rotation quietly and thoroughly.<br>
<br>
It is the responsibility of the 2 or 3 large guilds to be continually looking behind them for those other guilds that may be ready, or close to ready, to enter the rotation.<br>
<br>
Once more than those 2 or 3 guilds start nearing the capability of killing those same creatures, then the agreement needs to be brought to ALL member guilds of the RTA to discuss and vote.  The best place to begin the discussion is with the then standing &quot;Gentlemen's Agreement.&quot;<br>

I for one do not support this last minute change BS about the named Mobs in ToV.  You wanna make a change?  Fine.  Give all the Guild leaders and Guild Reps the chance to give their say so, then ill have no problem following the new rule. Until then dont expect everyone to obey your new law because..umm.. you said so?<br>
<br>
Personally I could give a flying f!uck about the Named in HoT at this point.  Its past that, Its more about principle.  I think its lame that because 1 guild came up a little short handed and they actually have to wait another week before they see &quot;their&quot; mobs again.  Truth is those mobs were never yours, they were FFA <br>
(except for between <br>
2-3 old school guilds who shook hands in a deal that didnt involve me), but now that it isnt working out for them, they decided its time to change the rules for their benefit.  See when it was only the top 2-3 guilds doing it its easy to make a gentlemans agreement because they both made out, now that more guilds are doing it, they have to once again change the rules to suit them best.<br>
<br>
If you want compliance, present it and deal with it properly, dont just make some last minute changes to cover your own asses to try and show that you are right.<br>

<br>
Uh, yeah, actually, they do have the right. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but quite frankly, a guild like, to use an old example, United Necros, has no business telling Clan Bashemded what to do on a rotation with Zlandicar, because they are not on it with us. In the same respect, Clan Bashemded has no right to say to BotS &quot;Hey, guys, you know Vex Thal? Here are the rules for it, as I see it. Pay attention&quot;. <br>
<br>
To hell with that. If you can't actually kill the big mobs in question, why should you get a say about how it is run? If you want to change it once you get there, and prove you can do it, talk to the guilds on the rotation with you. If your suggestion is a good one, they'll listen. If it's self serving and bad, then they won't. The point is, until you are actually able to kill it, it doesn't mean anything to you, except conjecture and arrogence. <br>
<br>
Does it not occur to anyone that if two guilds are after one mob, and a rotation is made, it's not going to be a weighted rotation. There will never be a stipulation on any mob that says &quot;yeah, you can kill it when you wait your turn, but the key parts have to be given to members of another guild&quot; because no one is stupid enough to enter into that agreement. <br>
<br>
Here's the biggest thing to remember about rotations: They are voluntary! If they were not at least TRYING to be fair, people would abandon them and go FFA on the mob in question. So yes, the guilds on a rotation, and *only* those guilds have the ability to decide what happens with those mobs. <br>
<br>
Quite frankly, asking my opinion on ToVN rotations is more than useless, because I don't know how it works first hand, and as such, can add only conjecture and random garbage to the discussion, thus making it worse. <br>
<br>
If you 'know all about killing the mobs' then prove it: go kill them, get on the rotation, get your say. <br>
<br>
Basically all the rotations will come down to this: <br>
<br>
Kill the mobs within 24 hours, or pass to the next guild in line so that they can kill the mobs. (noted exception of ToVN with 48 hours and delay to be sure all mobs are up). <br>
<br>
Where is the imput of the entire community required?<br>
<br>
That's right... it's not. <br>

&quot;It's not Gradukk's, Emil's, Karadin's, Xedd's, Rogg's, etc's job to help you run your guild. It's yours.&quot;<br>
---<br>
/sarcasm on<br>
<br>
Are you sure?  Cause i have been reliant on them this whole time to hold my hand and get sh!t done...It'd feel kinda funny now actually running my own guild.<br>
<br>
/sarcasm off<br>
<br>
Anyway, set your rules up in advance and POST them on the boards.  This will avoid future conflict with mobs such as &quot;the Doze Mobs.&quot;  <br>
<br>
If this was always a law and such common sense why is it that many others along with me had no idea that it existed, i owe explanation to few people and while i may ask someone for advice I rarely feel it necessary to come to you asking permission.   If it was always a law it should have been written down long ago.  <br>
----<br>
&quot;The drakes have always been a part of the Dozekar rotation, this is nothing new.&quot;<br>
----<br>
<br>
If this is nothing new then why edit the rotation from saying Dozekar the Cursed to Doz and the Named Drakes?<br>
<br>
Obviously some changes had to be made so that the rules between the older bigger guilds somehow now could be applied to the up and coming guilds who again made no such agreement nor were we asked for our imput, we were simply told, then soon after the Boards were edited to support what they said. Had you checked the boards 2 days ago it would have said nothing about the Named in HoT which meant that they were FFA mobs, and no I am not going to ask Karadin if I can kill a mob before i do, its stupid to think I should have to ask permission before I Kill each and  every new mob i run into, nor will I.  I will however continue by rules set forth on these Boards as i have in the past.  I am very strict with my guild and myself in regards to following the rules that we have set up here for Rotations and Planes, etc.   What i am objecting to is how i was asked to come into a chat channel last night and then i am getting hammered for not knowing rules that are not posted on the Rotations.  Uncalled for.<br>
<br>
Last night Karadin asked me why didnt i ask him about the named drakes.. like wtf? Who are you to grant or deny me permission to kill Mobs that are not listed as rotation mobs, even if they were on a rotation it is permittable to kill the mobs and get on the Rot.  Trust me when im raiding im not even thinking about asking for your permission on which mobs i should or should not kill, its not right to expect me to either.<br>

Well then how can RTA enforce the Rotations and the Plane reservations. How can RTA revoke a guild's posting privileges  if they are just the host for links?<br>
<br>
So if it's correct that the guilds who get there first make up the rules so that they can play nice with each other while the rest of us build up our guilds to even get to their level, don't you think that they should submit their agreements to the community? Don't you think all players should be able to reference these agreements as opposed to players from 20 guilds sending Karadin, Kenshiiro, Brotor or the Pope a /tell asking them to explain the agreements of the mobs in HoT while they are pulling AoW?<br>
<br>
Then this agreement issue gets me thinking ...what if BoTS tells TL here's the agreement on AoW--You can't kill him unless you pay us 100k each time you kill the giant with the purple hat and if you don't pay us then you can't be on the rotation. Is NB, FK, LOL and LOM going to have to pay BoTS, too when they break the rotation?<br>
<br>
So I ask you, why doesn't the community as a whole get representatives to review these made up policies? <p><p style="line-height: 100%"><font face="Papyrus"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=189879"target="_blank"><b>Keranee Pureheart

I think the question is that there are guilds who can kill the named drakes but not Dozekar and why can't they have a say in the named drakes...  The same is for ToVN... there are/will be guilds who can kill Ikatair and Eashen but not Aaryonyar for a little while.<br>
<br>
I understand the question they are asking but I also understand that they don't see the whole picture.  In any case, I think that Dozekar and the named mobs spawn near the same time.  (I've only been to one Dozekar killin)  If this is the case, then they should all be down or they should all be up.  If the named are up but Dozekar is down, then someone 'left them up' although this could also be because someone sniped them and their spawn times are off from Dozekar.

I was present for this conversation and this comment is taken out of context.  Karadin was saying that Kenshiiro has no problems asking Karadin about information on other mobs/rotations, with the example Karadin stated as being how many hit points Zlandicar has, but yet Kenshiiro didn't think to ask Karadin for the information on any HoT rotations/conventions.  It had nothing to do with 'asking permission' for anything.<br>

<br>
There's no need to open the rotations up for general discussion because the rotation guidelines are based for the most part on common sense:  Kill the mob and join the club.  When the mob spawns on your turn you have 24 hours to kill the mob or pass to the next guild.  If you do not kill within that time, your turn passes to the next guild.  If a patch is declared, then the RTA reps will agree to have 'FFA' days as required. <br>
<br>
It's simple.  Your '10000 plat' analogy just isn't going to happen.<br>
<br>
Now, there -are- a few exceptions to the above rules.  These exceptions were not made just to suit us. They were made because the situations require exceptions.  An example of these exceptions are NTOV and the Dozekar rotation.<br>
<br>
You see, before Verant put in the random spawn code it wasn't an issue.  The drakes all spawned at the same time and if you didn't kill the drakes then nobody was to blame but you.  Now, however, each of the drakes is on a random spawn timer, and so we have to use common sense and WAIT until all of the drakes are up to kill them.  <br>
<br>
Why should Noble Blade tell BOTS/Tindi what their Blood rotation should be like?  When Noble Blade kills Blood, if we have a problem with the rotation THEN we will have earned the right to discuss it with the people who DO kill the mob.<br>
<br>
If you don't kill the mob, then what does it matter if you don't have a say in how the rotation goes?  If you kill the mob, you DO have input.<br>
<br>
Now, some bright person is going to say, 'But Borick, if we don't have a say in the rotation, why should we bother about YOUR drakes?  We're not on the rotation, so we're not bound by your rules.'  And you would be right.  If you're not on the rotation, then you can kill all the named drakes that you want and all we can do is bitch...  until the day comes when you want to be on a rotation and expect fair treatment from us.  <br>
<br>
The rotation system protects everyone, even the guilds that are not on the rotations.  It gives these guilds a chance to see mobs they might otherwise never see.  Snub the RTA if you will, but the day will come when you desire a fair shot at a mob, and the rotation guilds will remember your behavior.<br>

Fine. We might understand the reasoning for wanting them on the rotation. But will it work? Most rotation mobs are hard to kill unless you have several well equipped groups. These guys are not in that class.<br>

Are there any more “hidden rotation” mobs out there? You need to speak up on this or we will go through this again.<br>

I'm surprised I'm dignifying that with an answer. First of all, there are five guilds of various size and ability on the Dozekar rotation. Of those five, I would doubt that any *one* of them would want to rewrite the conventions of the rathe server. To assume that all five are trying to somehow inflate their position, at the same time, and in complete concerted efforts, is obviously wrong, and borderlines being willfully ignorant.  <br>

Why, exactly, do you think that any guild *not* on this rotation should be allowed to tell the rotation guilds what to do, or how to do it? Quite frankly, if those 5 guilds wish to make a new clause in their rotation that they kill doz, and give all the loot to ME, that's their business, since they are the only ones doing it. After you get on the rotation, and see the &quot;yeah, Roggulbuk gets all the doz loot, per our rotation agreement&quot; clause, then you can say &quot;well, that's bullsh!t&quot; and have it mean something. <br>

<br>
Every time some new guild gets on a rotation, we don't have a town council meeting, get every guild representitive together, and bang out the details of the rotation again. You know why? Because they don't change when a new guild gets added. If you, personally, or your guild, cannot abide by the conventions of the Dozekar rotation, and can't help but kill the named drakes for no practical advantage to yourselves, by all means, go ahead. You will, I suspect, have them all to yourselves, minus the dozekar rotation guilds. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I am surprized that I have to even explain this to anyone. The fact that you are in a guild, and one that participates in some rotations already, should indicate that you have at least a miniscule degree of insight into the rotation system. Your statement, however, contradicts my supposition. <br>
<br>
On this server, for the duration of your turn, those mobs *are* yours. No other guild that is capable of killing the mobs, will do so, unless they are racing to actually get on the rotation, as your guild would have had to do. On, to the best of my knowledge, every *other* server, even if you are pulling the mob, it still isn't YOURS. Quite frankly, with our rotation system, and knowing in advance the day and approximate time a mob is due, if you 'came up short handed' with 24 hours in which to gather and engage and kill a mob that you've *already killed before*, then you really shouldn't be *on* that rotation. Personally, I think it's a little lax that guilds are allowed to pass on their rotation mobs: however, it's a server convention, and I respect that.<br>
<br>
And again, waiting a week is something that does not happen anywhere else but the rathe. Quite frankly, for the low to medium teir guilds (Velious and before), saying *anything* dispariging about the rotational system, or the way that it works, is the online equivilent of shooting yourself in the foot, kneecap, stomach and head. <br>
<br>
Why? Well, because, quite frankly, the guilds that are up owning the boss mobs of luclin do not have to worry about guilds that are still struggling with the boss mobs of Velious: we won't be killing luclin major mobs any time soon. As such, they could go around, ganking all the velious content and then go back to their luclin content at will, especially now with the absence of one of the sides of the 'big three' triangle. <br>
<br>
The rotation system works to the *detriment* of the strongest guilds on the server. I find it almost frightning that some people forget that, and do not treat a rotational system with the foresight that it deserves. <br>

You find this personally offensive because it directly affects you... how? The handshake agreement still doesn't involve you, being that you're not on the rotation. If it is so blatently offensive to you, don't abide by it. Seems simple enough.<br>
<br>
If you were on the dozekar rotation, and the other guilds changed it to &quot;all the guilds except SoY get to kill the named drakes. SoY gets to have them ganked at will&quot; then I could see your reason for indignation. Since the agreement is obviously fair to those on the rotation, get on the rotation or stop the whining. In the instance that you do get on the rotation, it begins to work in your advantage. In the instance that your guild never gets on the Dozekar rotation, than it is a moot point: what people do with the items from the named drakes is not an issue for you, since you will never be able to finish the quest. <br>

Why? So we can bicker about the Dozekar rotation, a rotation that we havn't earned a place on yet? <br>
<br>
Yeah, that sounds fair. Oh wait, no it doesn't. <br>
<br>
The bottom line is fairly easy: The rotations are conventions. If you feel so strongly that they are evil and wrong, you are not bound by any rule of the game in an enforceable way to follow them. No one will stop you in any way from taking any and all the named drakes if that is your desire. You can at will, ignore any and all rotations on this server.<br>
<br>
The fact that people usually don't violate those conventions suggests to me that the people who feel they are horrible and wrong and unjust number in a minority so small, that they do not even have the numbers requisite to form a guild strong enough to actually kill one of the rotation mobs. <br>
<br>
That suits me just fine. Let the misfits go FFA on the frenzied ghoul while guilds of at least semi-mature people work within the community to advance and attempt new things. <br>

I understand the nameds have a quest piece that goes with Dozekar, but that was not listed on the rotation.  Now for you to come on and say that the nameds are now part of the rotation is basically making up rules as you go and stepping on everyone else who can or have been killing the MOBS in question.  Its like saying dont kill the golems in Fear anymore cause they are now on the Cazic Rotation.  Well that just screwed the people who have been able to kill the golems and not CT. <br>
<br>
As i understand it if the RTA is only for links and stuff, then how was a vote taken place for the rotation schedule?  If these rules are being changed and Mobs that smaller guilds can kill are being taken away from them, then how is this rotation what the community wants, unless they voted on it?<br>
<br>
We have to camp quest Mobs all the time, but they are not on the Rotation.  I think the rotation is great and I'm all for it, but please don't change the rules and expect the smaller guilds who can kill the Nameds and have been, not to be upset.<br>

This is just my opinion as a citizen in the community of the Rathe, I AM NOT speaking for my guild.  Thanks <br>

The RTA consists of guild representatives.  All the guilds on the server are, in theory, a part of it.  Whether a particular guild actively participates and is represented is their responsibility.  Someone can only be removed from a rotation or such by the request of the guilds participating in that particular rotation.  Guilds who were once, and could still, participate in a particular rotation are also given their say (for example, BotS no longer participates in the Yelinak or PoF rotations and it is clear that we still could if we wanted and we still have a voice)<br>

Before now, there weren't a lot of guilds pushing into the mid-level or high-level content.  Most everyone knew everyone else and what mobs were on rotation.  The guilds who were, knew who to talk to about rotation issues and it was easy.  Since a number of new guilds are pushing into these areas, it is probably best that the agreements be published for viewing (not review).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Then this agreement issue gets me thinking ...what if BoTS tells TL here's the agreement on AoW--You can't kill him unless you pay us 100k each time you kill the giant with the purple hat and if you don't pay us then you can't be on the rotation.

Well, if such a thing were to happen, I'm sure Tindi would tell us that we are FoS and then we'd begin to hammer our a rotation agreement that all parties could agree upon.  Eventually, someone else WILL kill the mob and will also have their say.  Even if Tindi did agree to such a stupid agreement, BotS would have to give way or risk being pushed out of the rotation by the other two members.<br>
<br>
Many rotations lately were handled between BotS/Tindi/NB/(SoT) as simply stating that you killed MobX and wanted the 'standard rotation agreement' on it.  We all knew what this meant and would agree or hammer out a few details (like Ikatair/Eashen or named in HoT) in addition to that.  Agreements like ToVN didn't come about in a single day.  BotS and SoT representatives exchanged quite a few emails and even met in the game and in IRC to discuss the agreement.<br>

<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So I ask you, why doesn't the community as a whole get representatives to review these made up policies? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why would a guild of perpetual level 14 roleplayers need to have a say in content that they have not witnessed and probably will never participate in?  They would have some notion of fairness but they would have no clue as to the actual content involved.  Why would killing Aaryonyar give you 48 hour access to 8+ other mobs uncontested?  That doesn't sound too fair to all the other guilds.  What if other guilds wanted to kill one of those mobs other than Aaryonyar? Why can't they? Why do you need 48 hours? It's the mechanics of the game and encounters that make that agreement fair to the guilds involved.  At best, such voices would contribute to fairness, but if a guild is not pushing for fairness for itself, there is something wrong.  At worst (and far more common), such voices would add lots of noise and detract from the actual negotiation process.<br>
<br>
If you want a say in a rotation, fulfill the terms to get into the rotation and then you'll have a voice.  By that time, you will have experienced the content and will have a better insight into what it's all about.  Neither NB nor Tindi have never asked for a change in the ToVN rotation agreement.  Once they experienced it, I assume they saw that the agreement was reasonable and fair and found it agreeable to let it stand as it was.<br>

<br>
Nothing new was made up, nothing new was added, just because people did not know that the named were part of the Dozekar rotation before, does not mean it that the rule was just made up to add them.  Maybe the rotation was named wrong, but at the time it didn't matter when the rotation was made. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthaldin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thaldin</A> at: 9/16/02 11:29:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrommofbots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/16/02 2:38:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I understand the nameds have a quest piece that goes with Dozekar, but that was not listed on the rotation. Now for you to come on and say that the nameds are now part of the rotation is basically making up rules as you go and stepping on everyone else who can or have been killing the MOBS in question. Its like saying dont kill the golems in Fear anymore cause they are now on the Cazic Rotation. Well that just screwed the people who have been able to kill the golems and not CT.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
For you to say that we are 'now' changing the rotation implies that we are lieing and/or have some hidden agenda to screw people over.  The fact is that the guilds who participated in the Dozekar rotation have *always* done it this way.  Because the 'rules' weren't posted until now does not imply that the rules have suddenly changed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As i understand it if the RTA is only for links and stuff, then how was a vote taken place for the rotation schedule? If these rules are being changed and Mobs that smaller guilds can kill are being taken away from them, then how is this rotation what the community wants, unless they voted on it?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Rotation schedules are 'voted' on at the time someone is added to the rotation.  For instance, BotS kills Arch Lich (AL).  BotS is the only guild killing AL for a while.  No issues yet.  Tindi Losi then kills AL.  BotS and Tindi agree to a rotation, taking turns on AL, 'standard' rotation rules.  NB is bored one night so they decide to kill AL.  NB announces that they have killed AL and want into the rotation.  Since NB killed AL on what was actually BotS's (I think this was actually the case) turn, then BotS will go after them so now it is NB, BotS, Tindi in that order.  This is accepted with no contest by all three guilds involved (the community for the AL rotation).<br>
<br>
Again, your are accusing multiple guilds of changing the rotation rules on the fly and lieing about it to suit their own ends.  In most cases, the Dozekar rotation (in this case) is almost 'out of style' for the guilds involved.  Why would they want to do this?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We have to camp quest Mobs all the time, but they are not on the Rotation. I think the rotation is great and I'm all for it, but please don't change the rules and expect the smaller guilds who can kill the Nameds and have been, not to be upset.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, you are assuming that the rules were changed in the last day or two.  They were not changed, they were finally posted in a public forum so that you could see them.  Had you asked NB or Tindi 6 months ago, it would have been the same... even a year ago it would have been the same.  The rules as posted have been the agreement since it started.  BotS didn't participate in the Dozekar rotation for over a year until we got kind of bored.  We had nothing to say (nor should we have) on the agreement for the Dozekar rotation but I did see it take place.  In the end, we did get on rotation and we didn't ask for a reconsideration of terms because it seemed fair to us.<br>
<br>
The reason the named have been being killed was out of ignorance (not being offensive) of the agreement.  My guess is that none of those guilds bothered to ask anyone if there was even an agreement on them, much less what the agreement was.  The named have been disappearing with little/no explanation for a while and it was only recently when people started finding out which guilds were killing the named.  Now, some folks were brought into a discussion recently and everyone realized that the problem was a lack of information (the rotation guilds didn't provide it in a public forum before now and assumed other guilds would ask an existing rotation guild about it like everyone else had until now) and that is being corrected - the naming of the rotation being changed by request to more accurrately reflect the terms of the agreement and the posting of the agreement itself.<br>

You seem to be missing the point and taking my post apart for all the wrong reasons, and since i dont have alot of time as you do, i wont pick yours apart but ill sum up for ya:<br>
<br>
Since we are able to Kill the Named Mobs in ToV( I.E. half of the CoV quests, Doz being the other half)  we are(my guild) directly involved in these issues and should have a say so on what rotations they are on if any.  Should we or are we trying to dispute specifically how Doz's rotation is handled?  Nope nor should we, i agree with you.<br>
<br>
Let me just state that i am not trying to make anything FFA here, i like this server the way it has been set up.  I am asking for a little clarity of the rules and if something needs to be changed lets pass it by the Guild Leader or Reps who are on some rotations and proven themselves to be a solid guild. <br>
<br>
Because these rules were not clear to me, I &quot;thought&quot; that the named drakes were FFA.  Up until this point to my knowledge a mob was either FFA or on a rotation, eitherway there is no penalty for killing said mob(to me it was like killing stormfeather before getting Lodizal for the eyepatch).  The only penalty I knew of was being on a rotation and taking a mob down out of turn. <br>
<br>
What p!ssed me off the most was how I was handled after the fact.  I was expected to just know the special issue concerning Doz and the Named even when they were not posted on the Boards with all the other rules.  \<br>
