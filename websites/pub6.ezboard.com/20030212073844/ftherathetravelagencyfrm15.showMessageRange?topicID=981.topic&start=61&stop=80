I believe I still have my logs turned on, and I can provide you with evidence that at no point in time did FK say that we were attempting G/E cycle while having only 16 people in the zone.  As I stated, by the time Karadin got on line, and was in Ssra, FK had 41 people in the zone.  Being a GL of FK and in the channel I think I would remember what was said.<br>
<br>
Again, where does it state that you must announce your plans to the world 24 hours before?  Hell, sometimes you don't even know if the mob will be up or not, or if you will have the force to kill it on time or not.  The rule of announcing your intent was to prevent wasting another guild's time by making them go to the zone only to find the mob camped/dead, as well as to prevent streneous situations between guilds.  FK announced the intent of going for G/E, we had the force, yet Karadin DESPITE all that ordered his forces into Ssra.  At the time of our announcement to RTA there was only 1 NB in the zone, as well as 1 group of SoTE (again, this will probably show in the log if I had it on, as I was checking).<br>
<br>
We have asked guilds before if we could attempt mobs and were told no.  Again, the fact that we don't do it in the RTA channel where you can see doesn't mean it hasn't happened.  /ts were sent to appropriate authorities of guilds and we were denied.  The &quot;sorry, not on this turn&quot; gets old too fast when you hear it repeatedly.  Btw, thanks for calling me a liar... Its the one accusation that I haven't heard in years.<br>
<br>
You are abosulutely right Vince about hidden rules (please note the sarcasm).  Thats why there were no problems with CT, or AoW.  Funny how all of a sudden rules DO appear on the boards after there is some questionable act in the game.<br>
<br>
As far as punishment, I wasn't refering to the BoTS incident but to another (ED and Vols?).  And my point still stands.<br>
<br>
&quot;The punishment for breaking the Rules of Rotation is to lose a scheduled Rotation Turn&quot;.<br>
<br>
Correct me if I am wrong Vince, but that sounds to me like you are laying the law down for any rotation on Rathe.<br>
<br>
/shrug I would like to hear about these run-ins that you mention Vince... Because I am not aware of them...  Btw, ksing a moss snake from someone at lvl 1 doesn't count.<br>

<br>
I agree it’s easier to be one of the 3-4 near the beginning than one of the 5 who come after.  I also was one to agree to switching the *change* from waiting till your Statue, to waiting for one cycle.  I was merely pointing out inaccuracies in your assertion.<br>

<br>
All our members who needed primal also didn’t need ST, so we passed rather than go to something we don’t need.  We don’t get keys except off three mobs that are on fairly large rotations (Statue, KT, Yelinak), so we don’t need to go often.  ST was also not passed until the next day after because the server went down – which means at the time FK was in the basement, the decision had not been given to the rest of the server that you all were passing.  As for mobs not being verified up or not, it seemed like FK didn’t care if they were or not, they were going for G/E.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> We did kill your TM's to stall, call it frustration<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So which is it?  Did FK kill TMs to stall or did they wipe to an AE TM neither Kapen nor I have seen in Ssra?  (To be fair, Thundaron thinks he remembers one has an AE).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> We did NOT attempt to stall Tindi, a couple members got jumped by the wandering warden when watching all the TL funnel out of the tube, and we did kill him.

I can't lie and say I was sorry, who cares they were not held up. There were already enough TL there to pursue G/E, while FK did not have the numbers. We asked for a stay on him, TL declined, we said glats on your g/e/c. There was no more to it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Kapen relates a very different version of that situation.  I will let him tell it should he wish.  I wasn’t there, nor was I directly affected by it, and will thus leave that between you two.  I only reference it as another complaint that mirrors our experience.<br>

Sorry if we lost 3 hours learning how to pull the triplets, only to be so surprised to get a single that we wiped to Zlexak due to noone being prepared - it had nothing to do with lack of primal, I assure you. Oh did I mention that we only get a shot at NTOV once ever 4-5 weeks? Please try another excuse.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And I’ll take your respectful “fuck you”.  I know how hard N ToV can be at your stage of the game, I was there – pulling the triplets without those eye bead things is a bitch.  You were learning the zone, and you did respect the community standard.  That wasn’t my point.  My point is you are still learning N ToV and struggling with it, same with AoW and other Luclin bosses.  Trying to skip ahead to Ssra bosses isn’t going to be fruitful or easy.  Even guilds that can kill AoW will find Arch Lich difficult, as he has an AE manadrain dot and puts out more melee DPS than AoW.  As I said, I wouldn’t have made the unsolicited advice, except that you offered the same for NB.  It’s a lot easier to say “Well go kill Sol Ro or Behemoth” than it is to find Behemoth up.<br>

No, no hidden dig at anyone.  Just that each of those guilds to my knowledge has at least one person with a Factory flag, and could potentially blow Behemoth.  I was pointing out the difficulty of finding him up, as well as the difficulty killing him to counter your comment on what NB should be working on.<br>

No one could be happier than I if this did go to the grave.  Bottom line, I only list it among the variety of other run-ins to show a pattern.  We’re past the KS, we’re not past the pattern, and that is the problem.<br>

Just because I am verbose and clear on my meaning without punchy one-two line posts doesn’t mean I am filibustering.  I wish I could say I was sorry for offending the board trolls that are looking for racey one liners by being clear and precise in my explanations – but I’m not.  I will always err on the side of wordy, but well-explained, than trying to win the board troll popularity contest.  As for them being proud, I don’t see that as a valid excuse.  It’s called being considerate of others, and if they are too proud for that, we have an even bigger problem.  I’m not asking anyone to beg or grovel or demonstrate some kind of power struggle, I am simply asking for consideration of our plans and goals – much like you are asking.  When you don’t show us consideration, and don’t bother telling us what your plans and goals are, how and why the hell, should we show consideration to you?  It’s that simple golden rule, treat others as you would like to be treated.  So far from my experience with FK, it seems you want to race, and don’t want to cooperate.  Ok. . .then reap what you sow.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I just want to re-iterate the fact that I WANT us to cooperate on these mobs, it would be a lot easier.

<br>
Good, I *want* to cooperate as well, however, you are right on this cooperation not being so easy to come by when you have these run-ins cropping up.  They have the predictable effect of making me not want to cooperate with people who seem intent on pissing me off.  Every time we seem to have a run-in with FK it’s the same story, with this proud, stealth ninja mafia stuff.  Also, there isn’t always an excuse, and we have backed off of several mobs for other guilds to get on rotations, but they are willing to cooperate and be considerate.  When we have ONE mob for the night, I get asked after a TM has already been killed to stall, and I’m asked the night OF the planned kill, no, I’m not making excuses.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> And let me share with you a big gut feeling I have, you are free to correct me if I am wrong. NB had an okay time bargaining for rotations because it was just NB. Meanwhile FK is part of the &quot;booming middle class&quot; (FK/LoM/VoF/SotE/LoL) and it is no secret that once FK can do a mob, many of these guilds are also capable of it. Letting a guild onto one of these rotations means letting 3-5 guilds onto this rotation, and this really cuts into the relatively fast turnover on spawneds of highly desirable mobs, like say CURSED in particular since this is our favorite discussion piece of late.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, I don’t think that we had an okay time because we were just one guild, it was because we showed great respect and that has returned threefold on us.  Ask any BotS member or FK member how many guilds they WANT on any rotation mob.  The answer would be none, let us farm it till we’re done, and then we can move on without having to wait.  That’s a fairly standard human reaction – no one likes waiting in lines.  It also was not so far back (about 18 – 24 months) when NB and BotS didn’t get along so well.  They had been farming Vindi for a while and we had killed him – and wanted to do more.  He wasn’t a long enough spawn to put on rotation, and we had a few run-ins with them at the spawn.  Then BotS killed AoW, and there was no Idol.  We showed real class on coordinating with BotS on getting AoW on our Statue days.  They didn’t rush us or breathe down our necks, and in return, we made sure AoWs didn’t get wasted by the guild that could kill him at the time.  From that day forward, we have had a much better working relationship, because we would do simple things like “Hey, mind if we do X on Day Y, because you guys are doing A, B, C, D, so X shouldn’t make much difference?”  More often than not the answer was “Sure, go for it”, while they secretly wished we lost and died miserably.  I don’t think BotS wanted us on any rotation with them, BUT, I think I can say with some assurance, that if BotS had to share a rotation with anyone, that NB has always been one of the most courteous guilds to deal with (both breaking in and maintaining).  Pride never entered into it, I’m still just as proud of our achievements, because at the end of the day, it was still NB and NB alone that got the mob dead or not.  The fact that I chose our timelines for when to break in, and was considerate of the rotation guilds while doing so, didn’t make me a beggar or demean me in any way.<br>

<br>
No, its not a rule that you have to do this, and I certainly haven’t announced to RTA channel when trying new mobs.  In the last year or so I’ve always made sure to coordinate it some days before.  Yours was certainly a disjointed way of trying to cooperate.  Being forceful with NB, but trying to avoid a race you weren’t sure you could win and to avoid any rushing – which would allow you to get the full force we all want when trying a new mob.<br>
<br>
The dishonest portion of this, is you had 28 in Ssra when you wiped to a Taskmaster.  First, 28 people, even with half the force AFK, dying to a Taskmaster is like dying to an orc slaver but wanting on the Emperor Crush or Dvinn rotation.  What you are asking me to believe, is that you fully planned on killing Glyphed and Exiled with 28 people after the resist changes.  BotS would be hard pressed to do that, and they have by far better gear and experience, if not skill.  I know I wouldn’t risk a Glyphed attempt with 28 NB, and certainly not Exiled.  I think Baysar is a bit more accurate – you killed our TM to stall, out of frustration.  Especially considering that TMs are a 2 hour respawn, and they were imminently due when I logged on at 6pm PST – placing time of death on at least one TM at shortly after 4pm.  This would buy you the extra hour you needed to force NB to back off.<br>

<br>
No, I logged in, said to my guild, Ssra time, we’re up for Cursed – because that was the only mob we were up for that night.  Then I found out that at least one of the TMs has been killed long enough ago that it was imminently due, while I was being asked by a good friend in FK if NB would mind backing off our planned rotation kill.  THEN I was told in RTA channel that Fere “officially” requested NB back off, etc etc.  There also weren’t 21 NB in the basement, just in the zone, only 11 or so of us were in the basement at that time – me checking on TM spawns.  As for the XTC, as Baysar said about the KT KS, take that to the grave.  No one on this server fights XTC guards in that room but you, there was no way we could know you were in there.  We never came closer to your XTC room, we stayed to stabilize the room that we adversely affected by healing you when your cleric went LD because of us running in the room.  Once the room was stabilized, I had NB move back to the platform.  We then helped CR you after you wiped out, I am sure, blaming us for your loss, when truth be told, XTC with 40 people is a tough fight all around.  If it helps your morale to blame NB for you losing to an XTC that was at 12% when we zoned in (no, I have no idea what his life was at, but I hope you get the sarcastic point I am making), then by all means blame us.  Otherwise know that we never had intent to interfere with your XTC fight in any way, which is why we stabilized the room and left to the platform.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Fact: Karadin vows in RTA to play hardball against FK.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, I didn’t “vow” to play hardball.  You asked if we would back down, after having killed a TM to stall, I said no.  You then tried your RTA antics, and I asked Jlxaac if he wanted to play hardball (i.e. race to G/E).  He said no, he’d just wants to kill mobs.  You guys chose to play the stalling tactics of killing a TM, and in my book that invalidates any courtesy on my part.  You wanna race for G/E, then it’s a race you get.  You would have pulled with your 41 in zone, or I would have started killing TMs.  Had we spawned Glyphed and you attacked him, I would have petitioned you for KSing.  Had you spawned him first, I would have let you have your go until you died to either Exiled or Cursed.  I then would have continued where you left off.  That is what a race to that mob looks like.  A guild that knows what is involved in the encounter against a guild that doesn’t.  This is what racing us looks like, instead of being considerate and coordinating with us ahead of time.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Fact: Within a day or 2, a ruling appears on the RTA board about guilds attempting AoW only on their statue rotation. This is despite an &quot;agreement&quot; reached prior to that that guild attempting to join the rotation can only do so once per AoW rotation turn. The only guild left attempting AoW at that point is FK (VoF killed on that day, and had to fight through the BS to be put on rotation).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The rules were always “On your Statue turn”.  The mid-tier guilds all complained that it was too long of a wait, and a compromise was sought, but never finalized.  Until it gets finalized, that is what the rules are.  My view on AoW rotation rules were not affected at all by the G/E incident with FK.  I still feel that guilds should wait at least one AoW rotation cycle before trying, and I was ok with the Statue rotation rule being removed.  However, guilds going more than once per AoW cycle cause NB to go one full month between AoW kills (end of Nov to end of Dec).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Fact: On the Vindicator that you are referring to, there was another guild attempting him BEFORE us.

<br>
We weren’t in the zone when they were trying them, nor were we aware of them trying him.  Had FK killed Vindi an hour before we showed up, you wouldn’t have heard gripe one from me.  My problem is that you were still zoning the last of your forces in while the first parts of our forces were zoning in to do Statue.  When the Statue guild has shown up to do him, I consider it rude to insist on killing Vindi and delaying the Statue guild who has plenty of other things to do (and additionally stalling the AoW guild by default).  I think most people would agree.  I understand if Vindi is/was an important mob to you at the time, but you had 2 hours before we got there (he wasn’t our first kill of the night) to do him.  Instead you chose to do him right before us.  So, you took your shot, you lost, and we killed him so we could get to the Statue.  Had you coordinated with us, and offered to either join forces with us for Vindi or let us kill him quickly to get him out of the way, you could even have walked away with the loot.  We weren’t there for Vindi, we were there for Statue, and to continue on with our night.  We were also trying to get Statue dead so BotS could get to AoW.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Fact: Noble Blade has neglected to update some of its kills, particularly AL. Is it to prevent other guilds from knowing when the next spawn will be?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have neglected to update one kill.  AL, and that one over the weekend.  Additionally, no it’s not to keep guilds from knowing when the spawn will be, since he doesn’t spawn from his own time of death.  He spawns on the death of Rahg 2, which spawns on the death of Rahg 1.  That means, I could update all day long, and you STILL have no idea when Rahg 2 died.  As it turns out, we left AL up for 24 hours this time, but as no one else is on rotation at the moment, we didn’t penalize ourselves for not passing.<br>

<br>
FK asked me once, by using a friend of mine to ask.  It was about G/E/C, and what followed is listed above.  At no time has FK asked NB about any other mob in Ssra, other than a camp check in ooc for Cdr spawns.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> CT rules were never posted on RTA prior to the incident that you mention.

<br>
That is the sadest part of these “rule postings”, is that they are common sense for the most part.  You can’t race to a finish line where the door is locked.  And yes, it was covered in another thread, wherein it turns out FK got approval from a friend in one of the three guilds that had no raid authority.  The Raid leader posted personally that he gave the permission for NB to come enter Fear, not FK.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Fact: The &quot;punishment&quot; for taking a mob out of rotation was NOT enforced previously, was made up on the spot because it was FK, and because it was NB that KT was taken from. I have a feeling that had it been any other guild on either side of that equation, then something would have been worked out as it was previously done in such occasions. But because it was NB and Karadin vs FK, Karadin got what he wanted. Btw, I respectfully ask that the words SOME GUILDS be bolded in that ruling, to correctly show that not all guilds were in on the decision.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, the rule has been in place since long before FK thought about rotations.  It was enforced on KEG and BOTS and CIW by one another in the original Trak rotation days.  It has been used against BOTS and SOT.  NB has never had it enforced on us, because we have yet to break it.  If we ever do, you would find me the first invoke the penalty on us.  It had nothing to do with NB vs FK save that you guys were the ones who chose to break the rotations, and it happened to be our turn.  You then refused to try and work out any arrangements, saying that a simple “I’m sorry” should suffice.  And no, I didn’t get what I wanted.  I wanted to kill King Tormax on the night we were scheduled for him.  You made sure I didn’t get that.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Fact: The decision made about KT effects the WHOLE Rathe community, yet was reached by only a few selected individuals.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, what FK did on KT did risk affecting the whole Rathe community, and the rules for what you did were made long ago to keep people from doing just this kind of irresponsible behavior.  If other guilds were able to work out their differences without invoking RTA penalties, that’s great.  If you find a burglar in your house, its up to you to press charges or not.  In your case, you refused to try and work out any arrangement beyond “We’re sorry”, and you left us to find out on our own, despite knowing for several hours what had happened.<br>

So now instead of making it vs a person, he made it vs guild.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, I don’t hate any of the FK GL’s personally, I just can’t stand the way your leadership interacts with the rest of the community.  I have not gone out of my way to have any animosity towards anyone, hell just the opposite.  I have worked to improve relations with any guilds I can, because I care about our reputation.  I’m not looking for an enemy, my game plays just fine without one.  However, that doesn’t mean I’m gonna take being treated discourteously without repercussions.  You seem to think I hate Eros, just the opposite, I think Eros hates me, for whatever reason, and that has led to some (not all) of these run-ins.  It was certainly the case with his attitude at Vindi.  I don’t have anything against Eros that I am somehow taking out on FK.  It is the collective leadership, that took Rogg’s “mafia” comment a bit too seriously, and seems to think its above having to work with the community.  This includes you Fere, Jlxaac, Jurassic, Eros, and to a certain (albeit lesser) degree, Sylph.  I speak quite civilly with the majority of your guild I run into, it’s just when it comes to the FK leadership and rotations that things seem to grow needlessly silent.<br>

<br>
FK did NOT wipe to a Taskmaster with AE<br>
<br>
What we did wipe to was an AE. That is, there were a bunch of us in basement waiting for more to arrive and realized that we had 4 wizzies and 3 mages there, along with a chanter. Well we were bored so decided to AE the mines while waiting in the hopes of getting some green metal to drop. An AE pull of 20 or more skele's is what wiped us, a TM had absolutly NOTHING to do with it.<br>
<br>
How any of you could believe that one TM could wipe 28 ppl is beyond me....<br>
<br>
So i would appreciate it if you esp Karadin would stop bringing it up in an attempt to make FK look gimp.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baysarfk>BaysarFK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/13/03 8:20:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> I just wanna add a correction - we didn't wipe to a Taskmaster's AE, we wiped to an AE pull from the mines while people were showing up, heh.<br>

I do still have a problem with you evaluating capabilities of our guild, although you &quot;don't want to tell us how to run our guild&quot; that doesn't seem to stop you from belching out your opinion, and that is your right.  But I get the fair rebuttal:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My point is you are still learning N ToV and struggling with it, same with AoW and other Luclin bosses. Trying to skip ahead to Ssra bosses isn’t going to be fruitful or easy. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't play this game for fruitful or easy.  Sorry I have real life for being careful, I like to take advantage of the fact that this is a video game and take some risks.  We have little interest in repeating NB's pattern of over-farming and advancing too slowly (this has been admitted by an NB member, I believe either you or Borick in reference to when you entered NToV - you were overprepared I believe was the phrase).  FK has a lot of player drive and we push for risky fights because that drive is wasted and we end up with a lot of dull wordy farmers if we give no outlet to this drive.  <br>
<br>
As for Ssra bosses - you said it yourself we had him at 12% on our first attempt ever.  We killed Glyphed and almost killed Exiled months ago (but lost mad dps when he went on a wall climbing spree) - we know we can win these fights so don't lose any sleep over what we can or cannot do.  I liken this to people telling VoF how many clerics they need for AoW - they know how many they need leave them the fuck alone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baysarfk>BaysarFK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(1/14/03 8:23:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: RE</span><hr size=1> bleh him @ 12% = XTC<br>

Why don't you cockmunches try him?  Do what we did.  Insert Ranger into the ass that is SSRA... hit tracking.  You'll see him up, he's a three day spawn.  We very often leave him up for well over a day.  If you get on the rotation, then cool, we'll rotate with you if it prevents you from crying like a bunch of little bitches.  If suddenly the more skilled guilds on your &quot;calibur&quot; see that you've downed him, and want in on the rotation, then phatty, we'll rotate with them too.  <br>
<br>
I'm an asshole like Borick, so please don't hold anything I say against NB.  Most of them wanna be fair with you, I'd prefer to kick you in the face and urinate on you all.. cept for Petrucci, I'd have that guy's child if I could. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showMessageRange?topicID=981.topic&start=201&stop=208>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showPrevMessage?topicID=981.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=981.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=981.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.threadControl?topicID=981.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=981.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=981.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="therathetravelagencyfrm50">General<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm15">Flame Central<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm11">Guild Representatives Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm52">Rathe Etiquette <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm17">Applications For Calendar Posting <option value="therathetravelagencyfrm32">Rotation Access Requests<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm21">Changes to Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm12">Administration Forum<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm16">Approved Posting Entities<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm20">Wanted:  Alliance<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm14">The Town Crier<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm18">The Trading Post<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm53">Bard<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm54">Beastlord<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm55">Cleric<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm56">Druid<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm57">Enchanter<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm58">Magician<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm59">Monk<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm60">Necromancer<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm61">Paladin<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm62">Ranger<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm63">Rogue<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm64">Shadow Knight<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm65">Shaman<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm66">Warrior<option value="therathetravelagencyfrm67">Wizard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00FFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency>The Rathe Travel Agency Board</a><font color=#00FFFF> -
