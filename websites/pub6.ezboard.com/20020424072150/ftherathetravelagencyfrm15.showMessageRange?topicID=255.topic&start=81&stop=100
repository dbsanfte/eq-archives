Like others have said, You have CONTROL over statue, ST, and Zland, or Kland, whichever.    You REFUSE to use that control to put them on rotations with the other guilds that can / have killed the mobs.  But yet you cry that BoTs won't put you on Ntov rotation?   Are these not the facts? Thats what all SoT memebers are sayin .. /shrug.<br>

<br>
I am a level 60 cleric in LoM.  One of the &quot;smaller guys&quot;  I have no loot envy.  To me, it's not about loot, and if it wasn't to you, it would not have been mentioned.  <br>
<br>
I have no problem with Sot, Bots or anyone on this server.  I play fair and respect all, the best I can.  Calling people &quot;smaller&quot; and having &quot;loot envy&quot; does nothing for my respect for you.  Just shows what you think of us, IMO <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utibben00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tibben00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/31/01 10:48:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Spirit of Tunare on another Rathe Fir</span><hr size=1> A slightly more civil post then my others now that I have a clear mind:<br>
<br>
I have encountered some decent SoT members but I'm sorry to say, the majority of the guild are Lemmings. From your point of view it doesn't seem like you are doing anything wrong because Shei feeds the guild lies to justify his questionable decisions. SoT members just follow their leader whether it be in support, fear of being guild removed and not finding another guild, or because the incentive of getting loot no matter who you run over appeals to them.<br>
<br>
There are 3 other large guilds here telling you otherwise. <br>
<br>
This is not only focused around the NToV CoH incident as some SoT members keep coming back to. This thread was created by built up frusteration and anger due to the general attitude and actions SoT has carried for the past couple of months.<br>
<br>
Your guild wants to do what they want, when they want and without interference. Sorry if the other ~1500 people on the server can't cater to your needs but we also play this game for fun. Your guild is is slowly sucking the fun/life out of this server.<br>
<br>
Instead of allying with the remaining higher end guilds on the server and working out solutions for rare spawns, your guild insists on being the outcasts. On a person to person basis this may not be the case but when Spirit of Tunare and it's leadership is mentioned as a whole, it's reputation is soiled.<br>
<br>
Arguing about past events such as Zland and Tindi/SoT or NToV on these boards will settle nothing. Accusations arise and are denied in an endless cycle and random flamers join in to add fuel to what should be a dying fire.<br>
<br>
Spirit of Tunare, your guild leaders have made some decisons which many outside of your guild have interpreted as being wrong and unjustified or, justified solely by greed. Like it or not, that is what your guild has become in the eyes of many of your fellow gamers. It doesn't matter if you do a good deed 1 day, such as CRing a guild in Fear, and then go on the next day to do something with aggrivates and offends another guild. For every person you mention that has no problem with your guild, there are always 2 more that do have a problem.<br>
<br>
The solution? Lay off and show some common courtesy to other guilds and you will get the same. To this point guilds have shown you courtesy and Spirit of Tunare gives none in return. If a &quot;Guild A&quot; lets you attempt a mob for a long as you please before they do, without breathing down your necks, why turn around and step on &quot;Guild A&quot; or any other guild for that matter.  At the moment the issue between SoT and BoTS is giving you back what you dish out.<br>
<br>
Spirit of Tunare wants time to be able to attempt Aaryonar and other NToV mobs. Lets call this &quot;sharing spawns.&quot; Why would anyone give your guild the luxury of time when in turn Spirit of Tunare does not do the same?<br>
<br>
The SoT members who feel what their guild is doing is wrong should speak out for the sake of your guild and the server. I for one have, in past events in Tindi history. It may cause some turmoil within the guild but in the end its best. Playing with a blindfold, oblivious to whats occuring around you is dangerous.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are a member of Spirit of Tunare and have read to this point and still do not understand:  The followers of Hiltler thought that their actions were justified and for the good of the world. The rest of the world saw Hilter and his followers as savages.<br>
<br>
This is on a much larger scale of course but is still comparable to this situation here in EQ. Hope it gets my point across. <br>
<br>
Flames aside, something needs to be done and hopefully the change will come from SoT, you cannot continue on in the manner you have been.<br>
<br>
I speak for Tindi`Losi as a whole in this post, not just myself because I am 100% positive many agree with me.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Just read Galactis' post. This is far beyond being between only BoTS and SoT. If you can't see that then you need to step back and think hard for a bit. I know very well what I'm talking about, obviously by your rag of a post, you do not.<br>

<br>
I love reading the RTA and all the TL members posting s'hit about how we lie.  Maybe if they got the facts straight first it would help.  For those that weren't there for the Zland thing, or don't know, Lycant/Nardar, can't remember who, had invis on, walked forward towards the mystical rat who seems to agro Zland, lagged to hell lost invis and agro'd.  I'm sure this happened because we (SoT) have a secret plan to stalk TL at every corner and disrupt your raids.  And then the best part is, the next time we showed up for Zland, two certain TL members, trained SoT, on purpose, then Merloc goes on to tell us why they did it... /sigh<br>
<br>
The Doz thing.  I didn't know we had killed him as someone back a few posts implied.  At the time it was proposed half the guild didn't want to.  Personally I wasn't there for the attempt, and after that attempt we haven't look at the Doz spawn again... btw, the post about Kearlie saying we kill Doz to piss off Merloc is bulls'hit, mainly cause Kearlie is on heavy meds, and doesn't speak for the guild, thanks.<br>
<br>
The ToVN CoH past Aary was/is cheesed'icked, i'll admit that.  When we did CoH I wasn't to happy about it, but wasn't about to tell my guild to F off cause of it.  The ub3r lewts wouldn't justify a 1 hour raid, nevermind a 6 hour one trying to figure out how to split those 3 f'ucks.<br>
<br>
As for Rotations, as I write this there being worked out.  Personally I'm all for em, makes @#%$ go smoother and prevents the flame fest of pure bulls'hit that this thread is for the most part (Except Emil's and a few other's posts.)<br>
<br>
To all you bandwagon jumpers who spew s'hit without knowing the facts, you can all get the f'uck out of here.  That kind of stuff is higher on my cheesed'ick rating then CoH'ing Aary.<br>
<br>
In regards to SoT spying... what members do in their spare time is of no concern to the guild.  We don't have a mandate that says everyone should make lvl 46 alts so we can go everywhere and spy on bots.  You give more away in strategy for Yeli in the SS you post of his dead body then Anderas gets sitting in your camp.<br>
<br>
As for this flame thread, I think most SoT members will be dropping it.  Most just want to get Rots in place and move on.  On the topic of flames I regret to inform you we have agreed with Sssorn to stop flaming each other.  This means the thread on noows.com will become less entertaining, there goes the best free entertainment on the net : (  <br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to read this... <br>

p.s. The best quote out of this entire thing imo<br>

p.s.s. The obligatory disclaimer about how these are my own opinions yada yada yada and in know way represent my guild blah blah blah.<br>

Real quick Edit here... to all you morons who want to equate us to followers of hitler, the taliban etc... go f'uck yourselfs, cause that kind of thing is out of line for a video game.<br>

<br>
As for the rest of SoT, you're all just sheep herded along by a cockmuncher of a GM called Shei, any personal attacks on me are just water off a ducks back cos quite frankly i couldnt give a flying fuq what any of you think, your all greedy mouthy little scrotes who act like they have had their toys taken away 99% of the time. <br>
<br>
In all honesty the majority of the guilds on this server are just plain fuqin sick of you bunch of wankers running around thinking you all that, manipulating spawns, trying to KS, ninjalooting, training etc and then thinking you got a clean rep heh. But these posts are all moving away from the main fact of this post, SoT are bottom feeders, you pulled a lame ass move on BoTs in NToV, your rep is now void across all servers, not that it means much to you cos in your minds you will allways be UBER! /snicker <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><imgsrc="http://http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/10395.jpg"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Falconus<br>Knight of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16862">Profile</a><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utequmojoman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tequ Mojoman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(10/31/01 11:48:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Spirit of Tunare on another Rathe Fir</span><hr size=1> No Falconus, most people are just tired of the constant incoherent s'hit that spews forth from your mind.  And who cares about other servers and what people think of you? They don't play here, we don't interact with them every day so why does it matter?  OMG 90% of the player base on Bristlebane thinks that 45% of the player base on The Rathe are Lab Monkies who where used to test breast implants!<br>
<br>
The problem Falconus is your fingers seem to move faster then your brain, so you type stupid s'hit without thinking about it first.  Next time you want to flame atleast make it intelligent, spell slang words correctly, its F' U' C' K.  Also try and keep from repeating yourself as you seem to have done with reiterating your last few posts, we don't need 3 posts for you to say you think we are retarded failed lab experiments.<br>
<br>
Oh, Falc, go re-read your post where you call us Zergs, and go re-read Haxx's post where he proves we aren't and your just stupid.  You play this game for who knows why, NB plays it to have a good time and let everyone be involved, we play to *TRY* and do the best we can with a minimal amount of players. <br>

Things are being handled between Bots, Sot, Tindi and others on what was discussed here so this thread no longer needs to be added to or continue to degrade into a mass of insults.<br>
<br>
As i said in my post that i hoped discussions among the guilds could solve it, i believe that is what is going to happen. <p><BR><center>

<br>
I *might* make myself look bad if people who are not even members of the guilds involved keep expressing their un-informed opinionson the issues being taken (and handled) by the involved guilds.<br>
<br>
BoTS, Tindi, NB can post to their hearts content about us...because THEY are involved with us.  People who can't even get to the zone where some of this stuff occured/know nothing of the mechanics involved/garner all their information directly from posts of this nature can get out their kneepads and start apologizing for all I care.  It is the UN INFORMED MASSES that truely piss me off...not the people with a legitimate gripe who happen to be posting about it <br>

What this all boils down to is respect. I remember poking fun one day at SoT when they died at Tormax. Shei didnt like it much and gave me a tell something like<br>
&quot;WTF cant you give us any respect..&quot;<br>
Respect is something EARNED not given out (as is contempt). You have EARNED only the contempt of <br>
basically the entire high level community on the Rathe.<br>
WHY? You are greedy. Period. <br>
You want everything spoonfed to you. <br>
Thankfully one of your guildmembers (cant remember who it was) finally confessed (sorta) that you all spy to learn strats. &quot;What guildmembers do in thier freetime is thier own business&quot; is what was said....<br>
<br>
I dont speak for the guild leadership, but many in the guild would like you too see maybe 3-5 NToV dragons...<br>
EVER. What I think you all are waiting for is to continue your greedy ways till you have no &quot;use&quot; for certain mobs then &quot;kindly&quot; agree to a rotation then. Then you leaders will say &quot;See we are on rotations now&quot; etc.<br>
This is not acceptable IMHO.<br>
In ending, Show everyone else some respect and maybe it will be reciprocated.<br>

I am not bandwagoning here either I do not know the facts and its not my responsibility to judge anyone.  I will say this many look up to the larger guilds someday and want to be in them.  Being with a large guild will always bring scrutiny of all the independents and smaller guilds as with Real Life many people who are looked up to are held to a higher standard.  Perhaps this is what this arguement is truly about.  And Yes I have not been to any of these places.<br>

I will say this the fighting between all the guilds on the Rathe effects everyone who plays on the Rathe.<br>

<br>
Well everyone has the &quot;This one time at band camp&quot; story in regards to one guild or another be it SOT, BOTs, NB, DB ect ect..<br>
<br>
This thread might have evolded out of an issue between 2 guilds but as pointed out by many the reason it grows is its been building for months now.. As far as individuals feeling unjustly being lumped in with their guildies.. Sorry.. But at the same time being a member should come with some responsibilities.<br>
<br>
If I do unjust things in the game it not only affects me/my reputation but that little tag behind my name. If you have aproblem with me /t me if what I am doing is that bad look for a guild officer or leader to handle it.  I have no doubts in my mind that if I was doing something to tarnish my guilds rep that I would be /gr in a heartbeat. At the same time when my guild leadership makes decissions and i abide by them I am taking responsibility for his actions as well.. If I don't like them I can argue and try and change thier ways but if I fail my last recourse is to /gr myself.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to bash individual SOT members, but I will say u need to observe/question your leadership as thats where the resposibility for how your guild looked upon falls. you may be a great person but if someone goes to your guild leader with a problem and gets told &quot;Gee thats to bad HAGG&quot; That reflects on your guilds attitude towards others.<br>
<br>
Now for my &quot;This one time at band camp&quot;<br>
Good ole LODI in IC.. I camp that turtle Religeously.. I know he is a FFA mob.. Recently I had call to observe 1 SOT druid Kite him and then claim the mob ( no other SOT in zone yet ). On the 2nd occurance where I felt SOT people crossed the line was when after waiting 6 hours for LODI to pop I see 3 SOT enter gnolls and park about 35 minutes before LODI is due.. When I know LODI's cycle I try and keep my guildies informed but I dont call them in to watch for him cause he is known to skip his spawn alot but it does put them on notice so they hang close to rings and gaters. Anyway, LODI pops, 2 clerics and the rogue engage no other SOT in the zone, within a minute 1 cleric ( who apparently bound at gnolls ) dies, Rogue engages mob, clerics try and chain heal rogue. When Clerics OOM Rogue runs around kiting. Meanwhile while all this is going on I have fellow guidies Zoning in, by the time the Rogue starts kiting I have 8 fellow guildies at camp (enough to take down lodi).. We sit back still only 3 SOT in zone we wait to see them die from LODI before engaging. The Rogue trains LODI on our grp. One of our members gets aggro and proceeds to kite and tried 2 times to pass LODI back to the rogue ( who used EVADE/SNEAK/HIDE ).. Once our grp member was alm dead we said screw it and told him to bring LODI in and proceeded to kill it. The minute and I mean the minute we engage it and out tanks have full aggroc the Rogue pops up behind the mob and proceeds to BS the mob and use everything she can to damage the mob, the SOT clerics move in close and a 4th SOT person (nuker) just stands there. We constantly told the Rogue to back off(no reply) Once LODI gets respectfully low and tanks have built aggro the 4 SOT people nuke/dot/poison/melee as much as they can. They actually ended up KS LODI (we only had 2 tanks working so alm all damage was melee). I know LODI is a FFA mob, but common practice is once a mob is engaged by a force that has a reasonable chance of taking him down he is considered owned. Sorry 1 druid kiting not claimed, 1 Rogue and 2 Clerics kitting while hoping more show up is not claimed. Fact that it was trained on us and the Rogue evaded to lose aggro is a BS tactic.. then to jump in once we decide to engage to attempt a KS is also BS. Yes his event was petitioned, yes typical GM response of SORRY nothing I can really do.. Yes sent tell to SOT leadership at the time to try and resolve conflict. Where said converse got me with SOT was, Well they could have kitted tol 1-2 more SOT got there so it was ours HAGG /ignore.. <br>
<br>
Not all of SOT are bad people, but the attitude and responses of your leadership to others is what your reputation is based on. To many people site specific clashes with one person or another and then becomes a flame thread between those people. I left out names here to point out while It was a clash and issue between a few guild members and a few SOT members it was SOT's leadership response that summizes ho others see you and your attitude when such conflicts need to be resolved.<br>
<br>
BOTs used to have the same perception problems with we r uber, we can own the mob, to bad for you HAGG (TM).. They've changed..<br>
<br>
PS *side note* on spying** I can't think of any guild that hasn't at one time or another had someone tag along on a raid to see how things are done. Mainly they are along as an invite. I've yet to see one of the guilds mentioned here refuse helping another guild out with info or inviting along when asked. Where animosity comes from is the not asking. Just because you have borrowed your neighbors lawnmower a million times doesn't doesn't make it right to borrow it a million and 1 without asking. Certian civil courtesies(sp) still apply be it in Real Life of a game based on Social interaction like EQ. <br>
<br>
Well this helped waste some WORKDAY time THX.. Hopefully some of you good SOT people will start paying attention to those that actively represent you.. and say umm maybe this isn't a cool thing to do.. <br>
<br>
PPS Falconus may be my brother in EQ, and I respect him alot and will travel to the ends of Norrath for him but anyone who knows him knows he's opinionated/passionate about his views.. and damnit I've tried to fill his mouth so full of popcorn to shut him up but damn they can't fill containers that large. *tries to distract Falconus from another post* Hey look falc a hot Woodelf sporting a bikini....<br>
<br>
PPPS.. I blame VI on bad game developement in regards to Competition on mobs, but we work with it the best we can.. and I must say the order and civility in regards to rotation on mobs between guilds on the Rathe is by far one of the coolest things about our server...<br>

<br>
I started reading this flame....and after the first half dozen decided that was a useless waste of my time and decided to cut to the end and add my two cents worth. <br>
<br>
First, I am in NO guild and this type bs is one of the reasons I am glad I am not. Ya know....all I hear is waaa waaaa waaaa when someone or something goes against your way of thinking. You would think the mobs don't respawn. You would think they have taken something that was yours....well, here's a tip for ya......it isn't. IT IS JUST A FRIGGIN GAME for jimminy's sake ! <br>
<br>
Get off the holier then thou bs....bet if I were to tag with each of you I would hear virtually the same stupid @#$! over and over. Not long ago was an SOT mem....and then after that was tagged with Tindi for a raid....gotta tell ya the paranoia in Tindi was thick over nothing. I had to laugh and tell them....get a grip! You are all the same....in your pursuit of uberness and loot you have all become something I think is rather silly.<br>
<br>
Pay your $10 per month to get pissed at others cause they don't play the game the way you think is right....WTF are you ....any of you....to point fingers at anyone else?<br>
<br>
GROW UP! Think I have said this before....if you were my kids I would bust your butts!<br>
