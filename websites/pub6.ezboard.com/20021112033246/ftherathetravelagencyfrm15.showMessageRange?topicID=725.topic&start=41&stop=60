<br>
Somehow, I got the impression these exp changes and class changes were made becuase they were needed for the upcoming expansion.<br>
<br>
As for the change to resists...  I don't know.  My knowledge is that druid spells always had problems with being resisted.  I forget if druids could mag or fire (or whatever) debuff a mob to make Winged Death stick better.  I do remember reading that debuffs are supposed to work better now.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
The only time I really work on exp is when I'm with a ready made group.  I hate Velks and Seb, and all those easy sit back and relax leveling zones.  For me, CT has been the best place to get exp when I hit 59.  I can't wait to try to get some AA points there now that I'm level 60.  My friends and I look forward to the extra exp that we hope to get on the mobs there.<br>
<br>
My friends and I quit going to HS after we were about level 58.  By then, most of the mobs at zone in, and the first couple wings were beginning to be light blue.<br>
<br>
Soloing in DL....  All I can say is my level 40 necro solos mobs in DL.  When my pally was between the levels of 48 and 50, he soloed in DL.  If you're around level 51 to 53, you might try soloing mobs in BW.  That is where I took my pally when he hit 51 (there were just too many light blues in DL at that point).<br>

You have numerous people at VI working together to change various elements of the game, and this is a delayed patch, which has put a number of the changes in all at once.<br>
<br>
Druids, Enchanters, and others are seeing this as a big conspiracy to nerf them, but it really isn't it.<br>
<br>
Break the changes down:<br>
<br>
1)  Spells with a two-component effect now have the ability to be partially resisted.<br>
<br>
This code is obviously not working as intended.  I've spoken with numerous enchanters who have some levels of Spell Casting Fury, and noone is getting crits anymore when using Dementia.  This indicates a flaw in the coding used for the two-part effect.  The druid epic is another item with a multi-part effect (dot and snare), and the snare is broken.  I feel that this stems from the same coding.<br>
<br>
2)  Experience lowered for low blues and raised for higher level mobs.<br>
<br>
This was done primarlly because of the huge amount of difficulty that people have had in getting a group since the implimentation of AA.<br>
<br>
The problem is, once you're done in DL (about lvl 50 or so), you need to move on to bigger mobs, but not a signifigant increase in levels (as in CT), but something that will prove challenging.  With the increased &quot;blue&quot; range that can be experienced by being lvl 60 though, this means that all zones having mid 40 to low 50 mobs (Seb, Velks, Chardok, etc) that are easily huntable are also huntable by the lvl 60's seeking xp, thus people who are 50-55 have a great deal of difficulty in getting a group in these places.<br>
<br>
The change will now encourage people to move on to other places, such as deep in Chardok, Sseru, AR, AC, ME, UP, Ssra, and other places for exp that will be more benificial to them, and in general I feel that this is a good thing.<br>
<br>
3)  Resists are now much more scaled and more realistically represented.<br>
<br>
As anyone who has hunted in ToV knows, there isn't nearly as much a difference in resists from sv100 to sv300 as there has been for lvl 58 to lvl 60.  That's a factor of 300% being compared to a factor of barely 3%.<br>
<br>
This, to me, indicates that there is a problem.<br>
<br>
By altering the resists, VI is attempting to rectify this problem.  However, it is very pervasive that mobs will have higher resists that expected now (because previously much higher resists were needed in order to make a marked difference).  It will take time for the scaling and the mob-set resists to tweaked, but it will happen given time.<br>
<br>
4)  Cleric Heals have been improved at higher levels.<br>
<br>
To me, this is nothing but a good thing.  Clerics are healers, and should be the best at doing so.  Combined with how difficult high end &quot;trash&quot; mobs have become, it is necessary for faster and stronger heals to be used, and they have been provided this.<br>
<br>
I am happy that clerics get this.<br>
<br>
5)  Clerics pet increased and new hammer added.<br>
<br>
Clerics can now solo rather effectively, although not as effectively as quad kiting previously, I feel it is compareable to how well a necro would have been able to solo at 56+.<br>
<br>
I feel, however, that VI has gone overboard in catering to cleric demands for the ability to solo.  Clerics have always been required to do certain things, far more than any other class, and now they need others much less than others need them.<br>
<br>
6)  Shadowknights have been given new spells.<br>
<br>
What can I say, this is a good thing.  In my opinion, Sk's are the weakest class in the game, and they've just been giving a more signifigant position in raids and in soloing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In conjuction, these changes present a number of problems.<br>
<br>
1)  With the new resists in place and the new xp system, it is now much less effective for druids, wizards, and others to xp as they have done previously.<br>
<br>
2)  Clerics are now more required for xp groups to be functional, and yet have been givin the ability to xp without having to be in a group.<br>
<br>
3)  Classes that have had signifigant problems in the past with soloing or group effectiveness have not been addressed properly, while a very solid class has been given the ability to solo.<br>
<br>
Enchanters are still unable to solo with any effectiveness when compared to ANY other class in the game.  Even if an enchanter managed to earn the AA for Dire Charm, they are still penalized for this by having the mob take a much larger share of the xp.  Combined with the broken partials code and the new resist system, enchanters cannot nuke a mob down with any effectiveness (675 if unresisted, vs having to kill mobs w/ 7k+ hp....the math doesn't work out in an enchanters favor, especially in light of their delicacy).<br>
<br>
Shadowknights still don't have a well defined raid function, although the added agro spells are a boost, they mostly overlap what an enchanter can already do, and they take up a valuable buff slot on the MT in order to use.<br>
<br>
Necromancers, from what I've seen, have fallen so far behind their pre-kunark power scale it's not even funny.  Their old main method of fear/pet kiting has been destroyed through a combination of bad pathing and lack of high level outdoor zones with any sort of an open area to fear kite at.<br>
<br>
Warriors, a requirement for a raid, are needed much less than clerics are, and still cannot solo worth a damned.  Now they face a cleric who with 2-3 nukes can outkill a mob.<br>
<br>
Rogues, because of their lower ac and defensive skills, have an even harder time soloing than your average warrior.  They make this up by being good in a group, but hey, clerics and wizzies are good in a group too.  GG Verant.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's my take on this patch,<br>

<br>
70% of the time, I am soloing somewhere due to the difficulty in getting into a group outside of the guild.  The biggest problem i see hunting last night, was the dramatic decrease in experience on the same MOBS i have been fighting for a few levels.  These are blue to me, and I know what the exp yields since i fight there so often.  I don't mind fighting a little bit more to even out the hell levels, but the problem I see is on deaths.  If i can't get a rezz, I usually lose 3 blue bubs per death.  This equates to 7-9 hours of work that needs to be made up, but now with this decrease, that time seems to be double that.  Who wants to spent 14-18 hours making up 1 death?  Why would they hurt classes that was meant to solo?  I find this boggling <p><center><image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif><b><i>"Big Bad Bonedaddy"</i></b><image src=http://www.ecnet.net/users/gas52r0/Jay/gifs/icons/set_b/3.7.gif><BR>

<br>
Soloing is pretty much all I do. Admittedly I don't spend hours a day quadding. Doesn't matter. I spend a lot of time, most of it actually, soloing skellies in UP. This was a mob that almost *never* resisted WD. Maybe once in a several hour session of killing from time to time. Now, post-patch, they resisted my partner and me a total of close to 15 times in less than 4 hours. That doesn't fit their patch message of making mobs that were somewhat resistant maybe more resistant.<br>
<br>
If they give us good heals, that's good for those who like grouping. Some of us don't. Now, what about all the other solo classes? What about the melee classes that solo low blues while they're sitting there lfg? Hell, what about the groups that go looking for xp and are forced to go to the absolute toughest place they can find, or else they won't get shi't for xp? <br>
<br>
In an effort to fix a problem of their own making (60s aaxp'ing in low 50s zones) they've destroyed a fair chunk of players who were making their way by soloing, or duoing, or even trio'ing. There go the days of me grouping with a cleric and war friend at WL zone in Kael making a little xp and faction. There goes a nice xp camp, the ent in the Hole.<br>
<br>
While some people can say that maybe the xp difference isn't so bad, I speak from experience. It is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udarkoak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DarkOak</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Blade</span><br>  Posts: 446<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/5/02 3:42:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Cleric changes</span><hr size=1> Well before the changes to clerics I'd have had one of hell of a time trying to solo anything that was blue. Last night, before the patch, I managed to solo shrooms in FG with 1 bub of hp and mana. (which is probably why they changed the xp around - nerf)<br>
<br>
A lot of the changes to resists don't affect the non-zek servers much at the moment, but on rallos zek for instance..<br>

This <br>
is only on test and VI has clearly stated that this may not go live. So the way I see it druids at the moment and time just got shafted big time.<br>
<br>
Soloing is and I guess now was my forte. I see no benefit for me to solo if im going to have to work 33% harder to get the exp that I should've had prior to patch. Yes this is a whining post but atm I really don't care. Unlike grping soloing has its rewards and its loses. As does grping. Soloing i.e. quading or the classic snare/root dot method allowed us druids to gain exp much faster than a full grp even with exp bonus for a full grp. If she/he knew what they were doing and knew where to hunt.<br>
<br>
The downside to this is if you die you find your own rez there usually isnt a cleric in the zone you solo in to rez you. You go LD you die any wizzy/druid that has quaded for awhile knows that with there buffs if they were to go LD they had no other grp mates at there side that would draw aggro from them and count you prayers because 99.9% of the time you are DEAD. And last soloing is just damn boring. Only recommended for those anti-social types=)<br>
<br>
I have no problem with grping I would actually like to grp but from my experience I have found it painstaking to have to wait in a dungeon zone for a grp when I could be out quading and getting exp at that moment. VI you really screwed up this time. I say you have to add those heal spells now. If not why should I continue playing my druid. NO one wants me in a grp as a healer. You have clerics for that. No one wants me in a grp as a nuker. You have wizzies for that. I think I see the master plan we are to be the new universal taxis.<br>
<br>
And whats this clerics now outpacing the pally's when is it ever going to end. VI wanted to balance the classes but they have only seemed to unbalance them further.<br>
I guess there is some good to come from this patch. For those that like to and can find grps out side of your guild. But I'm not going to go into those since they really dont affect me since I couldn't find a grp to begin with.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
** Experience Balancing ** <br>
<br>
The combination of the NPC experience changes and the post-50 &quot;penalty level&quot; rebalancing at once had a stronger effect than we anticipated. <br>
<br>
<br>
We've altered a few of the changes to more accurately reflect our intent. <br>
<br>
- The intent is to promote grouping, not to inflict a harsh nerf on our more casual players who frequently do not have the time to invest in finding and forming a group. <br>
<br>
- However, we do not believe that going solo should be the single most optimal way to gain experience in EverQuest, which is what it had become prior to these changes. <br>
<br>
<br>
That said, we'd like to take a moment and explain what happened. <br>
<br>
<br>
On &quot;Penalty Level&quot; Rebalancing (Levels 51, 54, and 59): <br>
<br>
- Many people saw much smaller experience gains at level 60. This was due to the &quot;penalty level&quot; rebalancing effect more than anything that was done to NPC experience values. <br>
<br>
- In the previous patch, Level 60 became a full level, when it had been half a half level the day before. <br>
<br>
- &quot;Penalty levels&quot; have once again been rebalanced such that level 60 is much closer to the half level that it was before, and experience was instead redistributed throughout the earlier levels. <br>
<br>
- The penalty effect is still mostly mitigated, however the distribution should be more fair to those who are already level 60, yet do not have a full bar in that level. <br>
<br>
<br>
On Grouping and Soloing: <br>
<br>
- From the point of view of a level 60 character, a steady stream of level 45 NPCs represented the single best advancement in EverQuest, when the score is kept in &quot;Experience Per Hour.&quot; <br>
<br>
- With the advent of Luclin Alternate Abilities, nearly every sufficiently advanced level 60 could eventually and easily solo these &quot;optimal&quot; NPCs, and benefit more than they could in any type of grouping. <br>
<br>
- We understand that forming a group, travelling to your destination, and other inconveniences have an effect on progression. <br>
<br>
- With that in mind, we've undone the penalties for killing low blue NPCs, and instead added an additional group bonus to those who fight NPCs that are reasonably close to the group's level. <br>
<br>
- The idea is that people should be willing to take risks, fighting the hardest NPCs that they possibly can, to reap the best rewards in EverQuest, as opposed to the blue NPCs that represent the lowest risk. <br>
<br>
- For both groups and soloists, we strongly recommend trying out harder overall zones and the more difficult areas of zones that you might already be used to. <br>
<br>
- We're confident that you're going to find that the additional risk pays off *extremely* well. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
** Resistance Balancing ** <br>
<br>
Resistances have been altered in PvP to bring the game back into more of a balance. Please do remember, however; In both PvP and PvE, resist gear above 100 will still remain important. We thank you for your feedback. Please do continue let us know how the next round feels on a larger scale. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1) Spells with a two-component effect now have the ability to be partially resisted.<br>
<br>
This code is obviously not working as intended. I've spoken with numerous enchanters who have some levels of Spell Casting Fury, and noone is getting crits anymore when using Dementia. This indicates a flaw in the coding used for the two-part effect. The druid epic is another item with a multi-part effect (dot and snare), and the snare is broken. I feel that this stems from the same coding.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Can't speak for the chanter part, as SCF is IMO a waste for chanters and never put points into it, (as our nukes are worthless) but the druid epic is working as intended.  Apparently druids have been complaining for a long time about the snare component on their epic and have finally convinced Verant to get rid of it.  The trouble with the snare component was that it made the epic effect as a whole a whole hell of a lot easier to resist.<br>
<br>
My initial reaction to the spell resist changes was &quot;Oh @#%$, I'm never going to be able to land another mez on an un-tashed mob again&quot; but when I actually tried it out, resists were only slightly more common on un-tashed mobs and nearly non-existant on tashed mobs.  We're also now rewarded for having those 300+ resists we've always had but have been pretty much meaningless.  All in all, I'd say the changes in the resist system were very positive, once they fix all the bugs. (ahh, the story of EQ... once they fix all the bugs)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2) Experience lowered for low blues and raised for higher level mobs.<br>
<br>

<br>
....not exactly.  In fact, I suspect it was a bit of the opposite.  My guess is that Verant intended to prevent the best experience in the game to come from mobs that posed little or no risk to the players killing them.  Previously, the best way for a well equiped level 60 melee to get XP was to 2box a cleric or shammy in chardok or FG and ravage mobs that realistically posed no threat to him/her.  The best experience I remember getting in a full group of well-equiped 60's was actually slaughtering billions of light blues in the KC basement.  We had 0 chance of dying, used no mana to speak of, and killed mobs literally faster than we could train ourselves with them, and raked in tons of XP.  If you didn't have at least 6 mobs on you, it wasn't worth bringing back to camp.  While being lots of fun, this is a pretty bad example of risk vs reward.  Verant &quot;fixed&quot; this by making said mobs not give nearly as much xp as a mob that would be dangerous to the PC thereby enticing them to fight in ssra, deep in chardok/velks/seb, CT, the deep, etc.  Unfortunetally, soloers (who haven't adopted IMHO quite as lame a playing style as the 2boxers... I'm gonna get flamed for that, I know it) go hit just as hard as the 2 boxers did.<br>
<br>
Hmmm- I'm not sure I interpretted what you said correctly.  It was harder to get a group because all the melee's in your average uber-guild were 2boxing or soloing. (which, ironically enough, resulted in AE groups, which 2boxers universally despised)  I'm talking about level 60 support classes in uber-guilds though, not people in Velks/sebilis getting ignored for groups in favor of level 60's.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The change will now encourage people to move on to other places, such as deep in Chardok, Sseru, AR, AC, ME, UP, Ssra, and other places for exp that will be more benificial to them, and in general I feel that this is a good thing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree, for the record.  It will make it a lot easier for people like myself to get groups now that all my guildmates are willing to make groups rather than 2nd boxing a cleric.  It got pretty damned irritating to go &quot;/gu Anyone want a chanter in an xp group somewhere?&quot; only to either get crickets or have a pally or ranger tell me &quot;Sorry, I'd love to group with you but I'm soloing right now&quot; only to see that person complaining about how pallies or rangers aren't wanted in groups.  Hearing people complain about how hard it is for them to xp and that it's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> soo</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> easy for chanters to get a group only to see them have 4 times as many AA points as I do is pretty damned irritating. (sorry about the bitch/whine/class envy there, had to get it out)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2) Clerics are now more required for xp groups to be functional, and yet have been givin the ability to xp without having to be in a group.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is not true.  While a level 60 cleric can solo mobs ~45 just fine and dandy now, a level 60 killing a level 45 now results in minimal xp gains.  It's just as impossible for clerics to get solo XP now as it was before, Verant just made it impossible for them to complain.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Shadowknights still don't have a well defined raid function, although the added agro spells are a boost, they mostly overlap what an enchanter can already do, and they take up a valuable buff slot on the MT in order to use.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Heh, I wasn't aware anyone actually used those stupid spells.  I use the aggro reduction one on myself a lot, but knowing Lohki I'm pretty sure he'd just click 'em off if I ever bothered to cast it on him.  It's also not like I have enough spell slots for the 20 or so spells I need/want memmed at any given time, and aggro-increasing spells are the least useful ones.  Whatever though.  Good for XP groups where the SK is having difficulty keeping aggro on himself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This is only on test and VI has clearly stated that this may not go live.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
wtf- when's the last time you saw a change on test that they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> didn't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> clearly state it may not go live?  When they made them live on test they damn near promised they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> would</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> go live.<br>
<br>
To ask a druid-specific question though- what do druids want exactly?  The way I see it, druids have been whining about how the ability to solo <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wasn't all that and a bag of potatos, and they needed CH/partial CH and more raid utility spells etc. etc., and now you're getting it- and now there's mad uproar about how they don't want CH and are pissed that their solo ability got nerfed?  Maybe I'm just dense, but the lot of you guys seem awfully confused.<br>
<br>
My view is that Verant is trying to push XP groups back to where they were pre-Velious, when XP'ing was actually somewhat challenging.  You know, when king groups were hard, but the rewards were ever so much sweeter.  When you actually had to pay attention to what you did in a group because you could be sure that if you screwed up, it would get you killed.  When if you wanted good XP and nice items, you had to risk spending the few miserable hours on a risky CR.  When the difference between having your entire party wipe was whether or not you were skilled players who knew what they were doing rather than whether or not someone warned you there was a castle train coming.  When CR'ing from the really rewarding camps was a difficult, dangerous proposition at best.  Nowadays, people hunting spiders in Velks don't even know what CR means anymore.  When's the last time you had to coffin from a frenzy group in velks?  Hell, when's the last time you had to coffin from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anywhere</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in velks?  When's the last time dying mean something other than simply consent one of the 5 people in your group who lived and having them drag your body 20 feet across the floor to the next group and getting rezzed there?<br>
<br>
If Verant wants my advice though, I think they're doing it wrong.  I think they should just delete FG, quadrupal the spawn time on spiders in velks (so people will finally leave those damned things alone) and add item camps and more defined camp boundaries in zones like the ssra and the deep.<br>
<br>
Of course, many of the problems in EQ need to be resolved by making an entirely new game.  There are too many classes for each class to have their own definited class role, mudflation is insane, the class definitions from the original game are now detrimental to the game... (CH, for instance, made sense when tanks had 3k hp's, but in today's EQ breaks end-game encounters.  Letting chanters mesmerize stuff was great in the original EQ but we had that class defining role removed because it would trivialize end-game encounters)<br>
<br>
Verant also needs to let go of the idea that there should be a &quot;right&quot; way to do any given encounter.  I want to see a progression of &quot;end game&quot; encounters that range from run of the mill to brutally hard.  I don't want to look at an encounter and say &quot;Ok, when the Verant designer made this encounter, he wanted me to do this that and the other thing... so I will!&quot;  I'm sick of seeing encounters like the AoW that are solved simply by throwing clerics and rogues at them.  I'm sick of seeing encounters like Blood that artificially require a certain class do a certain thing in order to succeed.  I don't wanna be a damned monky and I don't want Verant telling me what having fun is.  I'd like to see more encounters Grieg or TiV or Shei where Verant just screwed around and gave us what they came up with, but for God's sake, make the reward worth it, and try to be more creative than just mean.  I don't want Verant nerfing abilities that people used in ways- god forbid- contrary to their original intentions, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> definitely</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> don't ban/suspend them being inventive and creative.  Whatever.  I'll shut up now. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

Our guild uses SKs for tank mezing, helping with pulls, and spliting mobs up to help enchanters mez adds.  Our guild hasn't done this yet, but I think some of the larger guilds stick a SK in the dammage dealing groups to give attack buffs to the rogues.<br>
<br>
When I play my enchanter, and we do a main tank strategy, I normally am casting an agro buff on the main tank and a deagro buff on a rogue.  The tanks and rogues have told me that it does help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uruldarswiftnote.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruldar Swiftnote</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/6/02 8:54:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=60>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, wonderful...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Moot.
