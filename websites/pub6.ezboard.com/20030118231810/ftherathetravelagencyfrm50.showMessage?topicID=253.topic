I'm not in BOTS (obviously), but as it was explained to me, they were in Vex Thal when Blood spawned (not an expected server spawn, but a repop), and due to a wipeout were not able to get Blood.  They then let Tindi and NB know they would not be able to get him so he wasn't wasted.<br>
<br>
Not quite the same thing as having a known server spawn, and instead of diligently checking on him (in the event &quot;Tindi didn't know&quot;) to take him down, or even saying a word to anyone about their inability to kill Blood &quot;for whatever reason&quot;, Tindi was all over Norrath exploring and exping.  And that is fine, as long as you don't contend that you should keep your rotation turn despite your choice to neglect it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seranis>Seranis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/25/02 7:07:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=253.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Not quite</span><hr size=1> Karadin,<br>
<br>
I was in Ssra the night that happened, cuz it's when we were doing the pickup from an unkilled Cursed.  We finished up about midnight CST (1am EST), and when I was preparing to log, BoTS people started zoning into Ssra.  I asked them what they were here to kill, and was told that it was Blood.<br>
<br>
So, that's 5 hours before the scheduled patch that night (They happen at 3am PST, which translates to 5am CST).  The Blood was eaten by the patch, same thing that happened to Tindi.<br>
<br>
The RTA rules say that you have 24 hours to kill a rotation mob, and specify that if a mob is up near patch time that it becomes a FFA kill.  It seems to me that the Blood that spawned that night was well within the FFA range, and in addition, according to you, it didn't spawn until Midnight my time.  I don't know about you, but I have school to condend with, and can't stay up till 2 or 3 am to condend with fighting up to the emp room, prepping for blood, etc.<br>
<br>
You know how raiding goes.  When a raid to Ssra would be first called (at midnight my time, which is when you say Blood spawned), it would take an hour to get people there.  Then an hour to fight up to Emp room.  Then an hour to prep for blood, get mez and tank mez and ch rotation set up, etc.  That's 3 hours, leaving just 2 before the patch, and making it 3-4am.  I don't even think that Tindi would have the needed clerics to have killed Blood at this time if we had tried.<br>
<br>
In the same way that BoTS has an excuse, it would seem that Tindi would as well.<br>
<br>
So, I would like this clarified.  It seems to me that one standard has been applied to one guild, and a different standard to another.<br>

P.S.  I'm not an officer of Tindi, so please don't think I'm speaking on behalf of the guild, this is just Seranis talking. <p>&lt;CENTER&gt;<br>

<br>
Not 7:18 my time, 7:18 EST, which means Tindi had five hours, and making it nowhere near midnight.  Five hours almost before it's midnight for you, and Tindi was all over Norrath rather than checking (repeatedly) on the mobs they knew would be due.  Again, the only thing I know of the BOTS situation was what was explained to me - they were in VT and Blood *repopped* (meaning not a server up expected mob), while they were in there.  This was Tindi claiming they didn't know a mob that was known to be due imminently, and not even bothering to check him repeatedly (at best) or dodging this Blood because Emp wasn't up yet.  Merloc admitted Tindi knew Emp wasn't up, yet somehow Tindi didn't know Blood was up. . .the two are 30 feet from each other, and Emp is the further away!<br>
<br>
I don't see two different standards here.  I'll even take your version of it, that for some reason BotS flooded into Ssra to do Blood and claimed they were still up for him etc.  That is still better than Tindi being all over Norrath (exploring and exping) while Blood (a rotational mob obligation) sat for 5 hours (I understand late night raids are bad, so will have an EST midnight cutoff for the purposes of this discussion).  NB could have taken down Blood if we had known Tindi couldn't &quot;for whatever reason&quot;.   Or at the very least, Tindi could have worked something out ahead of time - but we got not one tell about the matter.   <br>
<br>
As for the 24 hour rule, yes the rules say 24 hours, but  you and I have both been through enough launches that we know servers are very unstable.  The likelihood of nightly patches is high.  During these times, to prevent mobs from being wasted, its best to think in terms of &quot;raid windows' rather than try and stetch the 24 hour window to the limit - chances are an unannounced patch will waste a mob or ten. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grommofbots>Gromm of BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood of the Spider</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/25/02 1:10:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=253.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   The two are completely different</span><hr size=1> BotS was in VT when Blood spawned. We were asked if we were going to kill it.  We responded that we were.  We had every intention of doing so.  We were asked again later, we again replied that we were (again, we had every intention of doing so).  We were headed to our last boss of the night and got wiped out.  After trying to recover near where we were, the survivors got wiped out by bad agro.  That killed a bit of time and we had to coffin.  Since this would take a minimum of an hour (it was already late and clerics were logging off as it was), we then announced in the RTA channel that we wouldn't be able to take out Blood in time and whoever could, should.<br>
<br>
Our case was one where we knew about the mob being up and fully intended on killing it until one of those Murphy's Law things happened, at which time we knew we wouldn't have the time or the people and had to pass.<br>
<br>
Tindi's case was one where the mob was up at 7:15 Eastern and they chose to explore PoP (the ones who could) or AAXP (those who hadn't received PoP yet) instead of taking down a rotational mob.  Tindi did not raid at all that night when they had rotational mobs to kill.  When you chose not to kill a rotation mob when you have no other rotational obligations, and instead you chose to have a free night, you pass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seranis>Seranis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/26/02 1:33:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=253.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The two are completely different</span><hr size=1> So, if Tindi has been raiding and killed Shei, TIV, Rumblecrush, Gore, Talendor, and other non-rotational items it would have been acceptable for us to let Blood die to patch?

<br>
That's what happened with BoTS.  They were busy doing the exact same thing Tindi was (non-rotational killing), and they were told that it was ok and they wouldn't lose their place on the rotation, so why is it different for Tindi?<br>

Ok, I'm going to go slow here so you can understand the difference.<br>
<br>
The patch was about a week before the BOTS &quot;incident&quot;.<br>
They are up for Blood, but he has not popped yet.<br>
They decide to go to VT to clear, since they had started VT before the prior guild killed Blood, as BotS were not the last ones to kill.<br>
While in VT, Blood spawns, but they are mid-raid and tell everyone they will get to him later that night.<br>
Wipeout happens, time is eaten, and according to you, they STILL went into Ssra to take him down.<br>
<br>
Now, fast forward to the Tindi &quot;incident&quot;. <br>
PoP has just released, and there has been a serious of nightly patches.<br>
Tindi is up for Blood, and checks once, notices Emperor is NOT up, but doesn't track Blood that two BotS rangers and one NB ranger DO track as up.<br>
Instead of checking for him (imminent pop due to server up and NOT a repop dependent on someone else's kill time), they head to the four winds.<br>
<br>
Now, do you see the difference?  BotS was waiting on a mid-patch pop, so had no way of knowing whether Blood would spawn at all that day.  Tindi *knew* Blood would spawn on day one of the patch, as he always has, but checked all of once.<br>
<br>
My theory?  Tindi saw Blood up but not Emperor and decided that Blood wasn't important enough to do without the Emperor and so went to explore PoP.  That's fine, but that involves passing your rotation mob, not trying to ignore him so you can claim a shot the next day &quot;because he didn't spawn&quot;.<br>
<br>
There is a world of difference between killing non-rotational mobs on patch nights while your rotation mobs are up (as Tindi has done to almost every Shei spawn to date, I might add), and being mid-raid when your rotational mob spawns, yes? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karadin>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/28/02 12:33:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=253.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Seranis</span><hr size=1> Another thought occured to me on the way to work.  Your analogy of Tindi killing Shei, Rumblecrush, Talendor, etc is not equivalent to clearing VT.  If Tindi were up for Blood, saw him not up, and went to VP (let's assume you had the keys to do it) to raid, and Blood spawned while you were in there, then I would be ok with you guys doing &quot;non-rotational killing&quot; while your rotation mob was up, and provided the next place you went after VP was your rotational mob(s).  That was not the case with Tindi, Tindi was all over Norrath having a free night, not raiding anywhere at all.  Which again, is fine, provided you pass your mobs like the rest of us do.<br>
<br>
VT involves clearing a whole zone, the list of mobs you gave is not a list I would consider contiguous, as you would have to travel many zones to get to and from each mob, any one transition of which makes an easy change of direction to Blood.  It's not equivalent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thundaxstormkeeper>Thundax Stormkeeper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/28/02 7:22:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=253.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Seranis</span><hr size=1> This was nothing more than a misunderstanding.<br>
<br>
We were not aware that Blood was up. When we checked it was not up, and subsequent people who checked probably got it wrong.<br>
<br>
There was no malice intended, and we paid for our mistake of not realising Blood was up by being forced to pass.<br>
