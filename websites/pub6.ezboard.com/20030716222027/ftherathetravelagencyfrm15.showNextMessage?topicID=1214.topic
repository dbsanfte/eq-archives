One of the many reasons you didn't get into NB involved a GM, WW, SoT, NB, a Clockwork dragon, and some good ole'fashion ninja-lootin'!  Is that thread still on here?  Or did we lose it in the fire of 2002?<br>
<br>
As for the original Hemmingway on here, if I were a wizard, and you asked me for a TL rudely, I'd /report ya too.  If people want to help you, they will, and if they don't, chewing em out for it, isn't going to make them jump to it!  Gotta love those L 11 newbs who chew you out for not casting C5 on them, or who try and tell you what Hand of Virtue is and where you can get it so you can cast it on them, because god forbid they xp without them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saas04@therathetravelagency>Saas04</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/23/03 7:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1202.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: never ask shazndy for a tl</span><hr size=1> God I wish it was Karadin, then people would realize how truelly ignorant they really are.

Please remind us all which highly respected guild you were an officer of at the time of this &quot;legit&quot; kill?  And for some real fun, how about you explain how being an officer of this &quot;highly respected&quot; guild gives ANY legitimacy whatsoever to the stuff you spew out?  <br>
<br>
<br>
Mr. Ranger Aladail,<br>
<br>
As for the TL thing, here is some general advice.  Most wizards that can cast TL spells do not have them mem'ed at all times.  Furthermore, most wizards in guilds that are setting up for/going to a raid have about 1000000 tells, /guilds, etc. to sort through to get THEIR guild members to the required place.  Does this mean you are less deserving then them? Sort of yes, and sort of no, depending on how you look at it.  Does this mean they are the scum of the earth for not taking the time to reply to a random tell or two, when they have at least 10+ people to personally take care of, no. <br>
<br>
The game does not revolve around you, deal with it.  As a non-porting class, I have learned that if you don't get a response after a tell, or *maybe* two, chances are the person has just as much, if not more, then myself to deal with now.  So I continue on my way seeking a lift to where I need to go.  <br>
<br>
Other things that have helped me hitchhike my way around Norrath for over four years is offering a small amount of cash, mainly to pay for things like the shards required for every TL spell, as well as the persons time.  More often then not, I am not allowed to pay, but I continue to make my small offer as a way of saying thanks.  These are just some common sense ways to show respect to your fellow gamer, which many people, like Saas, do not do.  <br>
<br>
So while I understand your frustration for not getting instant service when you *needed* to be somewhere, you must also understand that wizards and druids do not exist to port your butt at a moments notice.  Pestering them with tells, especially poorly worded ones, is a great way to make sure your pathetic ass stays in one spot.  The best you can do is politely move on, and try elsewhere.  Making a huge stink about it is not going to make it any easier on you.<br>
<br>
Hope some of these ideas help you in the future when you *need* to get somewhere.  Manners go a very long way, especially if you intend to play in zones other then Greater Faydark.<br>

I cannot imagine that anyone in my guild, other than yours truly, would be so abusive, unkind and maliciously unhelpful.  Using your above post as evidence, I believe I have deduced the cause of this unfortunate breakdown of communication.<br>
<br>
You see, none of our members are fluent in Fucktard.  <br>
<br>
Yeah, you'd think that after years of dealing with BOTS, we'd have picked up more than a word here and there, but frankly we're just not that good at deciphering the imbecilic ramblings of inbred morons.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid that when some mentally challenged mobile pustule such as yourself rushes up and violates our virtual personal space, our first reaction is to politely ignore the social gaffe.  After all, anyone can obtain an instant teleport to most locations through the FUCKING PLANE OF KNOWLEDGE, and for those few destinations that have a closer translocate location there are people who AUCTION THE SERVICE IN THE NEXUS REGULARLY.  So it tends to boggle us when some pustulent facotem of filth spams our chat window with unintelligible garbage.  <br>
<br>
So I can only apologize if Shandzy forgot herself in the shock of being accosted by a reprehensible fuckwit.  I assure you that it only happened because we're better than you are and have absolutely no interest in enabling your idiocy by actually forwarding you to another zone where you can spread your disease. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alistriwen>Alistriwen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>tba</span><br>  Posts: 711<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/23/03 11:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1202.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dear misfortunate fuck,</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I am sure she would be perfectly happy with that too! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mythranor>Mythranor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/24/03 4:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1202.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dear misfortunate fuck,</span><hr size=1> We need TL's to Hate. That'd be great... and no accept box.. just BAM &quot;You have entered Hate&quot;. Cazic Thule would work too, but you can run to zone too easy.<br>
<br>
The best thing SoE could do.. would be put a damn stone to Cobalt Scar.. that'd save me from being spammed for Tells from everyone and their kid sister for a TL to CS.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I load into zones and already have Tells on my screen asking for a port/tl/evac.<br>
<br>
But hey.. atleast we dont' have to actually zone when we port people anymore. Thats good.<br>
<br>
Come on SoE.. add a damn CS book/stone.<br>

He does, fuckwit, but if you havn't noticed, the flame boards do not allow custom sig's in them. Notice his sig on the main boards? No? Wipe the cum out of your eyes, snotrag. Now do you see it? Yes?<br>
<br>
Very good asslips, who he is, is no secret. Unfortunately, the same can be said for you. <br>

Toe in the trigger man, do us all a favor and stop polluting the gene pool.<br>
