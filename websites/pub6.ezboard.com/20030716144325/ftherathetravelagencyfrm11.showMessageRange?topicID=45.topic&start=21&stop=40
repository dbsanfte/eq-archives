Yes, there are more than 12 guilds, but if they choose not to vote, that is their choice. <br>
<br>
I'm going to extend the deadline on this to Friday 5pm EST (when I go home for the day).  If it remains tied at that time I will count each guild in any alliances that have voted. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/logo.gif" align="left" border="0"></A>Milambus Mandragon<br>Master of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uverbalsabre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Verbalsabre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mirth & Mayhem</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/20/01 3:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Vote: 6 Member invite rule (Rivised again)</span><hr size=1> &lt;Verbalsabre stops to shake some hands and kiss some babies&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Verbalsabre steps up on a soapbox&gt; <br>
<br>
Elaunder - You said you had no problem with option A although you did vote for B. Once again a vote for A does not effect you at all but it does effect us in a positive way. Please support that. <br>
<br>
Nyca - &quot;One other reason that the Rule of 6 makes sense.<br>
<br>
Verbalsabre, you say you only have 8 planable toons. What are the chances that all 8 can go the same day? Hardly any.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why would this support the rule? If only 4 of us can go then so be it. But if all 8 of us were available and NB or Freaks wanted us to come, because we are just so damn lovable, then we have to tell 2 people no? What do I say when they ask me why? &quot;It is the rule&quot; is all I have to say to them at this point. If they ask me why the rule exists I can only shrug because it does NOT MAKE SENSE.<br>
<br>
Foladen, Bias, Dark Oak and Doraedin - The only support any have offered for voting B is Dark Oak stating that A does not &quot;spread the wealth around.&quot; I would contest that the limit spreads it around less, If NB has a member that needs an item and we raid with them then it obviously would go to them first and us second. If they do not need it and we aren't there because of limit, it rots. <br>
<br>
I know none of you know me well, I want everyone to know that I am not trying to be a thorn in anyones side, I am just very passionate about this perticular vote because it will effect the smaller guilds, like mine, a great deal. Once again I want to reiterate that when this vote concludes I will shut my mouth and accept the results but until then I will actively campaign. <br>
<br>
Sit back and look at this objectively one more time and think about the things I and others have said. If we have shown you why A makes sense then please change your vote. <br>
<br>
&quot;THIS CANNOT EFFECT YOUR GUILD IN A NEGATIVE WAY BUT CAN EFFECT MINE IN A POITIVE ONE. PLEASE SUPPORT THAT.&quot;<br>

/em reminds everyone he is no longer representing freaks, just himself <br>
<br>
I supported B out of desire to meet at the middle ground on this discussion.  In the issue that came up, I argued that unguilded shouldn't count; and I personally still do believe that.  I personally support A.  However, my job, when I was doing it in freaks, was to represent the best interests of Freaks.  It is(was) in the best interest of Freaks to support B because it closed a potential loophole from people unguilding from a raid and then rejoining another posting guild.  <br>
<br>
That is what my belief was at the time I posted that.  Freak's current stance may or may not be different  now, and anything their representitve says should definately override my previous post.<br>

(Quick close the thread)<br>
<br>
I would be more then agreeable to a provision that prevents people from unguilding to get invited and then rejoining their guild after they went to the plane. Such a blatent disregard of the INTENT of the rule should not be allowed. It was an exploit that I did not realize existed. Discipline for such an action would have to be left to the admins. As with all the rules of the calender it is my belief that the admins have the responsibility of enforcing the intent of the rules, not nessasarily the exact wording. <br>
<br>
Did Guild X misunderstand and accidently violate a rule? Yes - Then give them a warning. <br>
<br>
Did guild X, motivated by greed, follow the letter of the law but disregarded the intent behind it? Yes - Take away dates.  <br>
<br>
An equal opportunity for everyone to go to the planes and have fun, isn't that what we all want? <p>Verbalsabre

<br>
if the rules (whatever they are) are clear and are not open for 'interpretation' of any sort, then the rules be the rules, too bad so sad if you violate them.<br>
<br>
As for this particular rule, my vote for CTA should probably be deleted since I am moving servers, and I don't know if CTA as a planes-capable entity will still be present on the Rathe.<br>
<br>
And to be honest, the more i consider my vote, the more i think the answer of '6 invites maximum from another posting entity' is a good answer.<br>
<br>
because keep it simple.  I've actually been sitting here trying to do the math to figure out how a posting guild would be used as a 'front' for other guild's raids, but I can't think of a scenario that wouldn't still involve only a single raid for the two guilds involved.  Unlike the previous calendar where abuses could happen.<br>

The fewer loopholes, the fewer chances for abuse; and therefore, the fewer reasons the admins would have to be involved.

I am just saying that I personally would trust the admins judgement in those cases. If others cannot then yes you are right the rules would have to be cut and dry. Maybe it could be worded some way where if you leave a guild that is a posting entity you still fall under the 6 people allowed from that guild for X days. <br>
<br>
You also said something along the lines of &quot;6 invites from a posting entity should be the rule&quot; No argument there. That rules makes sense and is nessasary. I am only arguing for the NON-posting entities because I did not see any harm in it. Eluander has brought up a potential abuse where 10 people from KEG could disband, go with CIW to Fear, and then rejoin KEG. Then CIW could do the same thing on KEGs date.<br>
<br>
 All I want is a ruling that allows the smaller guilds to be invited without a restriction and without the potential for abuse. <br>
<br>
(Disclaimer: KEG &amp; CIW I only used you for examples because you are leaving and NOT because I think you would ever try something like that, going to miss you guys.) <br>

All I can say is this about our fear trip we got suspened for.<br>
<br>
Ranger legs dropped - 3<br>
<br>
number of ranger in our guild that need legs - 0 <br>
number of ranger in VK that joined are fear raid - 2<br>
number that needed legs - 2<br>
ranger legs that rotted - 1<br>
<br>
This doesnt count the SK legs, necro robe and who knows what else that rotted. <br>
<br>
Even watchin the last pair of legs rot sucked for many of us. we were doing searches for any ranger 46+ and close to come and loot them. We dont have the massive greed many guilds do on rathe and because of it reguardless of what people say we were suspeneded for it. With us suspened from the calendar thats 1 more day the greedy guilds get to squeeze into a plane now for the few pieces they need and watching the majority of the loot rot. There is no way to tell how many of what piece is going to drop. Its always nice to have serveral people from each class present in a plane so rots are minimal. Our guild needed only a few select pieces, so we invited a smaller, non postin, plane noobs to go there and loot the majority of the drops. <br>
<br>
The calendar has admins to watch out, and if they feel a guild is breakin the rules somehow to get 2 plane raids a month then they can take appropiate action.  Whats to stop a guild from going to a plane and inviting 20 ppl from the same guild and having them go all anon. There is no real way to enforce rule B either. Hell just invite them into the posting guild for a day. Both rules have there problems but at least with A, smaller non posting guilds will be gettin plane ex and some loot. These non posting people arent bound by any calendar &quot;rules&quot; they could go into the planes at will and cause general chaos if they so choose, I think its in the calendars best interest to help the smaller guilds out and make it so that if your not a postin entity then plane armor is still a possibility. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urofellostherathe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RofellostheRathe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Norrath Travel Bureau</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/21/01 2:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Vote: 6 Member invite rule (Rivised again)</span><hr size=1> I've read through this thread and others on the subject, but i fail to find a truly huge reason against option A.
