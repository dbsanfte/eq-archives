<br>
So, let's start this discussion.  We currently have a system in place that works.  There has been a reasonably large volume of posts lately about independent/FFA days and how that would work.<br>
<br>
There have been 3 proposals I've seen bandied about, and I'd like to list them here and discuss which one of these 3 people would like to see implemented.<br>
<br>
This thread should *not* be about IF we should do these, or WHEN we should do this, but simply a matter of &quot;Which of these would be the one we should implement?&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe we'll never do it.  Hard to say.  But until we know what everyone thinks about which implementation is the preferred one, we'll never know.<br>
<br>
So, Briefly (Yeah right.  Briefly. This is me)<br>
<br>
For all propositions, the following is assumed:<br>
<br>
* There will be 2 days per month reserved for the raids. 1 day for Fear, 1 day for Hate.<br>
<br>
* BB rules will be 100% in effect to prevent wastage of God/Epic spawns.<br>
<br>
PROPOSITION A &quot;Second Class Posting Entities&quot;<br>
<br>
A second Calendar system MUST be created that has the old posting rule of 18 planeable members per posting entity.  This calendar MUST be run &amp; maintained by someone other than the calendar currently in use.  Posters would then sign up for Fear or Hate.  This proposition is essentially identical to the current system, but would be restricted to posting only on the 2 available dates in question.  NO administration, conflict resolution or abuse monitoring will be handled by the current calendar admins.<br>
<br>
PROPOSITION B &quot;The Indi Raid&quot;<br>
<br>
No posting entities, but rather a message board or 'sign up' list that has a cutoff of X number of people.  This can be determined by the administrator of the list, who MUST be independent of the existing planes calendar.  This type of list/registration may also be defined by &quot;First to Organize / First to Reserve&quot; so that a guild that desires a plane to themselves with only 18 people CAN reserve the plane if they have all 18 members available and post to the reservation list with their numbers.  NO administration, conflict resolution or abuse monitoring will be handled by the current calendar admins.<br>
<br>
<br>
PROPOSITION C &quot;The Prisoner:  Free For All&quot;<br>
<br>
No posting entities, no regulation, simply 2 planar dates that are declared open to whomever wants them.  Gentleman's Agreement between calendar posting entities that they will not go up on these days.  (nb., Big Brother guilds would still be able to send parties up to kill Gods/Epics if they could not be taken down, per standard BB rules).  NO administration, conflict resolution or abuse monitoring will be handled by the current calendar admins.  These raids would be declared over at 2am PST, or whatever standard raid cutoff time is in place for all planar raids.<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
So, if you had to choose one of these, which would it be?  And if you could make changes or add another one, what would it be?<br>
<br>
<br>
Note:  This is NOT a call for votes, this is a discussion thread.  Don't say you DON'T want one.  What I'm interested in attempting is start a discussion of what people would want to see.<br>
<br>
And I dream that anything hostile, abusive, pointless or off-topic will get deleted.<br>
<br>
I also want a pony. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
But with the population of the Rathe being what it is, Indy Days seem to be going against what the 'majority' of the Rathe wants.  <br>
<br>
When large guilds, such as KEG or CIW pr BoD (just to mention 3 out of how many) are willing to accept the Calendar as is, and wait their turn for their 100 members, why are we going out of our way to placate 20 people?<br>
<br>
I see in the 'official posting entities' old, established guilds that are willing to create alliances, just so they can get a posting date.<br>
<br>
I see a bunch of people posting here that the Calendar isn't Fair.  That they don't get their 'day in the Planes'.  Well, they could form an alliance just as others have.  Why *should* they get 2 days 'just for them'?  That's more than anyone else is getting.<br>
<br>
Until the Calendar settles down, and we see just how many  Official Posting Entities we have, I think we should shelve the entire idea of &quot;Indy&quot; or &quot;FFA&quot; days.</font><P>Nycah Aries'Syrensong<BR>

Talk about hypocritical.. whoa.<br>
This is a discussion, there are no rules just a base foundation.<br>
<br>
I see Proposal A and B as a smaller subset of the Calendar. A group of people who do not want to follow any of the rules of the calendar. Well there should be some compromise. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Proposal A/B with the addition that you cannot invite any members from any guild that is currently a posting entity or part of an alliance that is a posting entity.<br>
That's _pure_ Indy days. Such that your guild or organization would have to have at least 18 planeables or good organization to pull off a raid. You could invite other indies, but using the previous 2/3rd rule.<br>

If the &quot;Calendar&quot; is not supposed to be involved with these days at all, then why do we care how they handle these days?<br>
<br>
But for any of these options to work, I believe the calendar will have to be involoved to some degree.  <br>
<br>
As for which is better, smaller guilds sharing a much smaller number of days or a sign up list here, I don't really know.  I'm still waiting for clept, or Zanthor, or Jamany to get all these &quot;repressed&quot; people to post here so I can see how many small guilds there are vs how many indy people.  <br>
<br>
If there are 8+ small guilds that meet the 20 members requirement (20 instead of 18, making it 1/2 of normal calendar), but don't want to be allied with others, than I would say Option A.<br>
<br>
If there are say 160+ indy people that can't get into the planes other ways (invites, or forming thier own alliances) then I would say Option B would be the better option.<br>
<br>
And if both 8+ small guilds and 160+ indy people, then I'm not sure.  Maybe use both A and B, but rotate which plane is guild/indy on a month by month basis.  </font><P>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

Nyca - You aren't disagreeing with me.  My personal opinion is that these are a waste of valuable plane days.<br>
<br>
But when faced with the choice:  I choose 'C'.  Least amount of work and setup for the admins, least amount of problems the people here will be faced with, and puts the burden of organization, enforcement and any additional scheduling or preparation on the heads of those who want these days so badly.  &quot;Unenforced Days&quot; == a new player-made agreement on those days for those who don't like the calendar.  <br>
<br>
let's just hope that more people don't show up and decide that the people running the agreement/system for the Unenforced Days don't meet THEIR clept/zanthor/jamany, and find themselves faced with people threatening to train them.<br>

Well solution might be to see what are the average days in between guild raids to planes and make indy-ffa to fit that mode. Lets say Guild A gets to go up once to fear ever month and a half (strictly speculation here). Well then we make FFA-INDY day fit that mode. Not make it once a month, make it every 5th-6th week. Spread Fear/Hate in between so it doesnt seem like such a long time to them and just leave an open date then. <br>
   If there is an FFA/Indy day then there should be absolutely 0 involvement from the admins. Only thing that would be asked if for posting guilds to plz stay away for that one day and let the masses see how much fun a FFA plane is. Off course if a God Is up then BB guild should be able to kill him but only after a specified to &quot;allow&quot; the masses to enjoy the true fun of a fully god poped plane with DT's while cross training eachother. No need for 18planars or this or that. That would lead to others saying &quot;Why are there rules keeping me out of Indy day?&quot;. Leave it a free for all and let them have their fun(Insert sarcasm here). And after lets say 2 trial runs we decide that it a complete waste of time, then we can say sorry this didnt work out as you can see and plz organize eachother into alliances to post just like anyone else.<br>

FFA is NOT what I would like to see.  I've not been to any Planes yet, but i know greed is a powerful motivator, and if any place should have some guidelines, it's the Planes (due to valuable loot).  Offering up a sign-up (first come/first to organize) would work well, I think.  Calendar admins would only have to show the two dates as 'Indi Day'....the rest would be a sign up message board on the same area.  Once the first 18 (or 20) people to sign for a day is up, an Admin (of some kind) could lock the date.<br>
<br>
Thanks for trying to give us some valuable time in the Planes, guys.  As Zanthor has stated, we're choosy about who we align with..and forcing us to align with some guild just to get to be planeable isnt fair, IMO.  And being able to go with our Members is important to us...so we dont have Member X going up on Monday...and Member Z going on Tuesday...etc, etc.  That doesnt make for a very cohesive 'family', if you know what i mean. <br>

<br>
Both choice A and B revolve around Indy's getting preferential treatment strictly because they refuse to band together to become a posting alliance.  <br>
<br>
I don't believe that the Calendar Admins should have anything to do with making sure that no one bothers them on their raids.  <br>
<br>
Choice C, using Naelya's idea of both Planes being open for FFA on the same day, would be what I would say is most *fair*.  <br>
<br>
I don't want FFA, I saw FFA in the Planes and never want that again.  <br>
<br>
BUT, if you're going to go along with the &quot;anti-social, ME ME ME&quot; folks that come to this board and whine about &quot;no one caring about the little guy&quot;, when they are the ones that don't want to &quot;work with the majority&quot;, then do FFA days.</font><P>Nycah Aries'Syrensong<BR>

my final take after reading everyone's comments:<br>
<br>
The most cogent observation I saw was when someone said that all 3 options are 'ffa' from a calendar admin perspective.<br>
<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my next question to cause problems and bring flames to everyone's desktop today. <br>
<br>
When voting on a proposal to modify the calendar rules, what should the requirements be?<br>
<br>
A - Simple Majority (11 people vote, 6 vote for it)<br>
<br>
B - 2/3rd Majority (12 people vote, 8 vote for it)<br>
<br>
C - 2/3 Quorum (x people can vote, must have at least 2/3 x voting for a vote to count)  Example:  there is a selection of 33 voters (say the 30 posting entity reps &amp; zanthor/clept/jamany as an example).  At least 22 people would have to cast votes for the vote to count.  Then take the results and apply any rules for how many votes a proposal needs.<br>
<br>
D - vote based on weighted numbers. This one sucks, but I'll put it in because I know someone will mention it at some point. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Each voter is given the chance to vote 1-10 on a proposal.  1 = yes, 10=no, 5=indifferent.  An amendment is successful if and only if it's final vote tally is lower than some determined number. say 40 for an example, since people like it so much.<br>

Nyca : The example I gave was just an example.  We don't have everyone from all the posting entities coming here to vote, so it's not exactly fair to require all of those people to suddenly come here.  And if we say 'posting entities only' we're back to constantly fighting with jamany/clept/zanthor about not letting the 'little guy' have any input on the calendar rules.<br>
<br>
But Let's forget about all this for now.<br>
<br>
The calendar is working, let's all agree to go forth and be entertained for the next couple of weeks, and see where things are after that.<br>

If you have evidence of such a day, such a raid, then I believe there are procedures to discipline the offending posting entity.<br>

No posting entities, but rather a message board or 'sign up'. Any posting enities will be in violation of their calendar agreement by going. sign up to be monitered by the calendars administration.<br>
by signing to go on an indy day the players would not be accepting an agreement to conform to, nor be part of the rathe calendar, but excercising their given rights to go any where without needing someones permission.<br>

<br>
They can have input into the discussions, but when it comes down to votes, only members of the calendar should get votes.  <br>
<br>
But I guess if needed I could just get all the members of SB and NH to come here at vote too.  <br>
<br>
I guess I just believe this is one of those area where &quot;represational government&quot; is best.  Where one person (i.e. posting officer) casts one vote for many people (i.e. one posting entity).<br>

<br>
BB guilds are only to be called in when a god will be left up, it does not state anything about the rest of the plane.<br>
<br>
Ermm... just read the rules on the Calendar site itself, and what I just said is not what the rules state.  I think this rule nees to be clarified on the rules page.  I doubt the BB guild want to &quot;rotated&quot; out when there is no god up.<br>
<br>
But if you know of guilds not calling in CC guilds when they should have, report them to the admins or post it on the forum.</font><P>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

I think you mean an &quot;open&quot; day in which anyone and everyone who wants can enter the plane and kill mobs.<br>
<br>
My question about the BB list is this:  Is the BB rotation system in effect right now (as of this posting)?<br>
<br>
ZaronASB:  I know of five such incidents over the week when we had a patch every day.  Those involved know who they are and I have talked to a number of them about it expressing my (our) displeasure about it.<br>
<br>
Milambus:  The incidents of which I speak were cases where the people who were in PoF didn't feel they had enough to kill CT so they called in reinforcements from one (the same one was called five times by five different groups) of the listed BB guilds.  In some of the cases, the &quot;invited&quot; BB chose to simply help and didn't loot anything from CT or the quest mobs.  Other cases they did.  While technically &quot;helping&quot; the other group kill CT wasn't &quot;like&quot; calling in a BB to help, to me (and others) it is clearly against the spirit of that part of the agreement.<br>
<br>
Again I ask:  Is the BB rotation part of the calendar currently in effect?  If so, I will consider it in effect as of the time someone posts &quot;YES&quot; to my question and not make a big deal of the previous stuff and only keep notes from here on.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilambus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Tad-pole</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>87</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12/15/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>2:03:51 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif">&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Reccomend C - FFA day</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">As far as I know the full rules of the calendar are in effect, including the BB rule.</font><P>Milambus Mandragon<BR>
