and the Guild Rep forum</span><hr size=1> Is there actually a rule about back-to-back attempts regarding other rotation mobs?  I think it makes sense for AoW.  In theory a guild could try and fail 5 times in a row before actually killing him thus &quot;taking away&quot; content from other guilds for weeks.  Other mobs, like Statue for instance, are not &quot;taken away&quot; from other guilds just because another guild tries them...the only inconvenience at all is they need to wait until the guild is done trying.  Spawns aren't lost if a guild tries most other rotation mobs and fail, so it just seems odd that the back-to-back rule would apply to them.<br>
<br>
VoF doesn't feel other uber guilds have tried to hold them down...not at all.  If anything has troubled us, it's the fact that 1) There appeared to be somewhat of a double standard since LoM tried AoW twice pretty close together, and didn't get jumped on for it, and 2) The emergence of a fairly outdated rule that just doesn't make sense for the present situation.<br>
<br>
In the end, the main issue is that VoF and others want to take AoW down, but we (The Rathe community) need to decide what rules we (VoF) and others should abide by as to be fair to the guilds already on the rotation.  On the same note, we should try to sort out issues like these for other mobs BEFORE up and coming guilds get to the point of trying them (I believe Emil said he was going to think of other unwritten rules like these to do just that). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hutterr>Hutterr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/19/02 3:23:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=410.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AoW and the Guild Rep forum</span><hr size=1> Terg, you seem to be taking this as a personal affront to you and your guild, and its NOT. You guys did things the right way, made a damn good effort at killing AoW and either got unlucky or just didnt quite have enough firepower at the raid.<br>
<br>
Ive seen (and my guild/alliance is only on 1 rot at this point) MANY concessions from the larger guilds to let new guilds onto various rotaions. In fact, this entire issue doesnt even stem from the next guild on AoW rot, but from the server reps as a whole. This is a valid concern.<br>
<br>
Because of the &quot;testability&quot; of this mob (which youve passed), and Sony's ability to stir controversy, we see yet another part of our gameplay that we need to monitor ourselves for OUR own benefit...(its obvious sony doesnt give a shit). <br>
<br>
Nycah's suggestion seems quite fair to me (and Im a long way off from AoW.) It practically PUTS you on rotation, as once you kill statue, you immediately have a chance at idol/AoW.<br>
<br>
I could be misunderstanding some of what the rotation/spawning entails, but I think Im accurate. Our system is truly designed and run to be fair to all...including the little guy, the gettin big guy, and the guy thats already there.<br>
<br>
I support your right to express your thoughts, but before you do, please take a step back and dont think on a personal level, but rather what you might say that can help us all. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen<br>

<br>
Moving on:<br>
<br>
Yeah, the problem with making the statue/idol/AoW a ladder from one to the other is that the statue is little better than vindi once slowed, thus is a giant p00sae compared to Idol unslowed and AoW. As a result, more people can kill the statue than the AoW. That means that VoF would have to wait...(looking at the rotation) 9 pops of the statue instead of just skipping one possible attempt at the AoW. <br>
<br>
Since the idol drops zero loot and is very much like the AoW if left unslowed, it's coming to a general acceptance that the Idol/AoW should not be linked to the statue, BUT that there should be provisions to keep at least 1 in 2, and hopefully 2 in 3 pops to people on the rotation, considering the quality of loot that drops in that encounter. <br>
<br>
That's me tho. <br>

Why should we be allowed (at the time) to waste AoW after AoW until we get it right, when BotS at the time could kill him and benefit from the loot.  Thinking any other way about it, is greedy and selfish.  The AoW rotation isn't that big, so I don't see why VoF shouldn't wait for one cycle of AoW rotation or their next Statue (whichever is first) to try him.  I was unaware of LoM trying him close to back to back, and if they did, well shame on them.  That doesn't make it ok for VoF to try and get the rules changed for them.  Just because O.J got away with murder, doesn't mean you disregard murder as a crime.<br>
<br>
Additionally, as VoF learned first hand, killing Idol unslowed is *close* to AoW, but they are not one and the same.  AoW has a lot more hp, so you have to keep up your perfect healing rotation a lot longer.  Idol is exactly identical to the Statue, not AoW, so there is a difference of about 200k hp there.  <br>
<br>
I feel the same way about &quot;racing&quot; to AoW that I do about &quot;racing&quot; to CT.  While in the case of CT, I as a guild leader *cannot* enter the zone of Fear before the current guild is done, it technically isn't against the rules to be in Kael while guild X is doing Statue on my AoW rotation turn.  It wouldn't be against the rules, but how many of you want 50-70 NB, BotS, or Tindi waiting at the see invis giants near the arena while you're doing Statue, or worse, trying him for the first time?  &quot;Racing&quot; to AoW is thus different from Zland or Vindi, or Yeli etc, because there IS a rotation dependency here.  Until Statue dies, the guild up for AoW cannot take their turn, and thus they are &quot;beaten&quot; merely because of a dependency on others to take their turn on Statue.<br>
<br>
VoF being able to use a euro time advantage to try AoW after AoW isn't &quot;fair&quot; to those guilds who can already kill AoW and benefit from the loot.  As for whether or not it will take you 1 more or 10 more attempts is not the issue, as you can't guarantee either.  What I can show you is that every guild on the rotation HAS proven they can kill him and not blow the mob.  Until you can, you shouldn't expect your version of &quot;fairness&quot;.  Once you do, then you're on rotation, and you get your shot like everyone, and will understand how someone complaining they can't just keep trying him is a horribly unfair proposition.<br>
<br>
To summarize briefly, no guild not on AoW rotation should be allowed to try more than once per cycle (as it always has been), because of the rotation dependency of Statue.  Quite simply, until Statue is dead, NO ONE can kill AoW, and thus any &quot;race&quot; is a farce. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>

Seeing how all other guilds that are on Statue rot are USA guilds, we will always be sleeping when Statue gets killed and therefor other guilds wil have PLENTY of time to kill AoW before we are even awake. Not even counting the fact that most of us have a job so we cannot gather forces in daytime either. <br>
So almost a day will have passed after Statue was killed IF we find the idol up and can gather our forces. <p>Kenau Kamikaze, Phantasmist of VoF ,  Levlenna, Archon of VoF<br>

A US-based guild like LoL (tonight's guild) kills late, too late for (NB's) EST contingent who have to log.  Who is the next guild that will be online in force to get him that isn't on rotation?  Yes, the same guild that said <br>

So you leave NB with a choice if LoL kills late tonight - let VoF try AOW a second time since we saw him last (yes, that's right, a *non-rotational guild* getting more turns than one a rotational one), or try with forces that might not be enough and wind up wasting an AoW ourselves. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>
