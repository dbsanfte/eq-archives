<br>
Ok we are on a Raid with all of 2 groups going in. We have the Raid Coordinator who did all the home work for the area we are entering. We have a Raid Leader (is that redundent?) Who is assinging groups. And a Guild Leader who is calling that shots. All 3 being different ppl. Once the RC gets us to the room we are to be camping the RL assigns the MT. BTW the Raid Leader or Guild Leader have a clue about this zone. The pops within. Just the loot we are going after. The Raid Coordinator knows all the spawns between the ent and the room and even knows the respawn time.<br>
Now here is the Question. Why does a Raid of this magnitude (12 ppl) have to have 3 ppl to do this? And why shouldn't the person who did all the research NOT feel like someone kicked him in the arse when he is put on the back burner. AFTER holding the spawn we were going after for 2 hours at that.<br>
I know I would be really pissed.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utils.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tils</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.loopi.co.uk/bounce.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 289<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/1/02 5:51:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=666.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.loopi.co.uk/tils2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Question?</span><hr size=1> Raid Coordinator?

<br>
<br>
Raid Leader and Guild Leader are only ones which are really needed. But I guess from your descripion the raid leader isnt really a raid leader but the coordinator is.<br>
<br>
Sounds like its over complicating a raid having 3 different people. Theres always going to be the guild leader obvoiously who can over rule what the raid leader says if they feel fit...otherwise thats it.<br>

<br>
Using the chatchannels you can easily set up a raid_coordinate channel and a loot_decision channel and the like, so it's not one person who has to make all the decisions, but he can have some feedback before he calls the next order.<br>
<br>
Problem might be that people get confused listening to different people's orders. If you keep all the discussions in those channels and one assigned person steers the crowd it should be ok though. <br>
<br>
Sure, for just 12 people it seems a bit much, but depending on what those 12 people are like it might be more justified than on some bigger scale raid where people know what to do and things go fluently.<br>
<br>
For the cute Kaesora-and-the-like-raids I try to get going, I tend to have some overkill on the steering team as well. <br>
<br>
1 EO: person who organises, gets the people to the raid, makes groups, assigns other roles. Most work is done in the week before the raid starts, and once discussions/problems start while raiding. <br>
1 navigator: loud voiced person who makes sure *all* people move from camp1 to camp2 and don't jump in the wrong hole. <br>
1 buff divider: assigns persons to certain buffs and makes sure the raidchannel is not spammed with 'haste please'.<br>
some loot deciders<br>
1 person who keeps an eye on people's happiness. we have quite some people who are new to raiding and at my first raid I felt alone and clueless, so I try to have an experienced player guiding some of the newer people.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse all these things can be done by just one person perfectly fine, but I tend to divide more, so people have some feeling of being important and once things get complicated it is easier to resolve issues when you can concentrate on fewer things.<br>

<br>
My opinion:<br>
<br>
The fewer people you have coordinating, the more work that person/those people have to do. THe more people you have co'ing the more chance for confusion there is, and the longer it takes. <br>
<br>
However, for large scale raids circa hate, it is a bit more complex.<br>
<br>
My guild did hate a few days back and from what I can remember, there were about, 4 people doing most of the co'ing. This is a big raid remember.<br>
<br>
I was doing groups and had about a zillion and one people there, with two insert times for east and west coast. Let me tell you, that alone was a job, forget buffing, mezzing and what not. <br>
<br>
We had one person who was the raid leader, who basically said you go here, you go there, we're gonna do this next. (although due to unexpected visits by a very depressed Inny who needed friends we didn't really do much other than stare at Hate from the SS) The raid leader usually is the guy or gal who knows all the zones info and directs us on where to go. <br>
<br>
The next people (who I will consider one person for the purpose of this paper) were the MTs or MAs as you will. They basically told us which mobs to murdalize, and which ones to mezmerize.<br>
<br>
The last Co was the Loot Co, who assigned loot based on our guild's system.<br>
<br>
What Im getting at is, on a small raid with 12 people you shouldn't need more than one well educated (on the zone) person, and that's it. On a raid of some 40+ people we had only 4 doing the work with ease, shrink that raid to an easier zone and less people, and you only need 1 to do it all. <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif"</img> <br>

<br>
I don't know what kind of guild you raided with, but to me it seems their average brain cell amount shrivels in comparison with the amount of mana I can make you regenerate per tick. <br>
<br>
One raid leader to assign groups, nice nice.... <br>
how many groups were that again? two... 2.. oh.. difficult...  he most likely has some healers and some tanks to divide...  not who to put where? Best start an indepth analysis of the specific qualities of each toon available so a perfect match can be made. The hp's of the tank should match the healing capacity of the cleric, and those are huge numbers to calculate. Might as well assign an assistant raid leader for this. Also someone to check if no calculation errors were made.  <br>
<br>
Now all these finely assigned people have to move. All? To where? and when? owww... so many questions already! <br>
<br>
Loot? OMG loot ! all loot is for me ! oh no.. it's not.. I am in the loot committee, so I should divide it fairly. Hmm fairly. Ah we got a point system, clean and fair. But I want this loot. <br>
You shout: &quot;officers decision the Shining Bracelet of Inferiority is considered god loot and will be guild property (and I can wear it! haah)&quot;<br>
<br>
Ffroddo shouts: &quot;no way, I didn't get loot for 352 raids I attended so far, if I don't get it, I will hack all your accounts !&quot;<br>
Galanndril shouts: &quot;stfu Ffroddo, you got your No Drop Robe of Loneliness last week in Fear!&quot;<br>
Ffroddo shouts: &quot;now listen Galansmurf, that doesn't count as I was the only mage there and no one wanted it! gimme my bracers&quot;<br>
<br>
So now we need one person to comfort Ffroddo and try to get him relax so we can all sleep well and not fear for our accounts, one person to steer the discussions amongst the people who think they got something to say about loot and one person to guildremove those who are so driven by their greed that they forgot the complete environment they are *playing* in. <br>
<br>
The guildleader will say that I cannot have the bracers, so I will leave the stupid guild and when they are assigned to the raid leader, the other officers who wanted it will leave as well. <br>
<br>
Which results in one guildleader, one raidleader, a few half-asleep participants and a couple of people planning to train the prior guild's every next raid, just to teach them how they should fear them and not get in the way of their goals again.<br>
 <br>
Some more AE recruiting and this will keep going nicely. <br>
<br>
Nothing wrong with that, right?<br>
<br>
<br>

Starting arguments in /gu about these kinds of things is more of a distraction than having 3 people lead/coordinate the raid.
