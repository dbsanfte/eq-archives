Your calender is not now and will never be enforcable by verant. Their view on the contract between two people means if I (for instance) was in the planes with friends and you came in and said it wasn't my day, TOUGH! You cannot tell any player where to hunt and where they can and cannot go. You can suggest and you can compromise but you cannot tell them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jamany, no one has ever said that Vernat endorsed or will enforce this calendar. Keep in Verant doesnt look down on the calendar either. They have no opinion whatsoever since the calendar is not an official Verant site. Why doesnt anyone seem to understand that. It has been said soooo many times in so many threads. Hell I qoute something to you out of our Usage rules thread locatd in out Guidelines forum which everyone should read before posting on this board....and I qoute....<br>
&quot;This board, Its parent website, and the agreements reached here are in NO WAY enforced by Verant Interactive(tm). It is through mutual respect and co-operation that these guidelines are followed by The Rathe community.&quot;<br>
<br>
that pretty much answers your post. You wanna use the board and its resources your more than welcome, if you dont fine go do your own thing.<br>

(I do feel its too bad that my schooling is a source of validity here) or the fact that I came here to see what was going on and went ahead and set up an account to get a few answers, hence only one post (freewynd) .. I suppose no one else here ever was at one post huh?<br>
========================================<br>
<br>
Actually, you appeared to be attempting to pass yourself off as a GM.  I stated that it was the first post for your account and that I highly doubted it was a “real GM” posting here.  You came back and cleared it up and we now understand that you were not attempting to impersonate a GM.   Perhaps if you had given me a heads up that you were quoting a GM, things would have been different.<br>
<br>
You are correct in stating that the planes will be overwhelmed all over again.  As it stands now, they are.  Kunark was supposed to “spread us out” a bit, but that was short lived. Velious is supposed to give us some relief as well.  Hopefully the planes in this expansion will loosen the belt and give us all breathing room.<br>

Have a nice day,<br>

Granted it is getting bigger everyday. But the point you are trying to make is, well, pointless at present. The current model fits for what we currently have, as things progress so to will the model. Nothing is set in stone per se. And _when_, or perhaps _if_, there are 2500 46+ players, they will have to come to some agreement and/or compromise, else the planes will be first come first serve. <br>
<br>
<br>
Let's see..<br>
<br>
1st point: It was suggested previously to have the 1st and 15th but the idea was later removed.<br>
<br>
2nd point: Posting Verant crap on this board, and it is Verant shit by the way, will get you flamed to hell and back. Don't bother quoting Verant's garbage on a player forum it won't fly. But mistaking you for a GM, might be hard for some but it is possible.<br>
<br>
3rd point: Devil's advocate.<br>
<br>

<br>
what i purposed was a day when the subscribing calander people would give everyone else a crack at it and stay out. yes it would be a free for all day but not with you people, because you want us to accept your decisions and are basically says screw ours because you 100% control, which in fact brings us back to the PnP and also at the same times shows that perhaps the PnP needs to be used, because with this type attitude on your part you are saying more and more .. i believe nycah said something to the effect<br>
i want it so it will be or something to that effect<br>
<br>
okies i see im not getting no where here fast, there is always someone that will say there will be consequences, okies im ready for the consequences, lets have fun and see if they fall under harrasment or what ever<br>
<br>
your too ready to say screw you, we want, we will have,<br>
you keep saying PnP will not work, maybe its time to see, after all there is two we's here, who knows, but remember i came here in the first place to talk and find out and what i found out is a closed door, you definately show us small no account people that maybe we do in fact need the gods intervention here<br>
<br>
<br>
Hehe, Darin nailed that one - 99.99% of the populaton of the rathe understands that the PnP (Play nice policies) do more to hurt player interaction than they do to help it. 99% is not 100% and as you dont care what others think why should they care what you do? <br>
<br>
and the .01% of the time got BOTS dissolved i believe,<br>
Correct if im wrong wasnt it one of your own peoples that called the gms .. so ya must in reality know it Does work<br>
<br>
perhaps with enough hurt ... BOTS had what four accounts closed i believe .. no biggie go spend another how many dollars and start again<br>

You KNOW I am not in an &quot;uber&quot; guild.  What has been done here enables everyone to get a fair shot at going to the planes.  I KNOW once or twice a month doesn't seem fair, but when you consider the vast amount of people that can now go to the planes, thats about what it works out to, and it is not as bad as you might think.<br>
<br>
Something that everyone that posted forgot to mention concerns the loot drops.  Because the mobs are on such a long timer (12 to 16 hours) that means they only are up roughly 2 times a day.  Once they are killed (if done quickly) you will be waiting all day for them to come back.  With the calendar in place a guild, or alliance, gets to have those spawns to kill and loot and nothing goes to waste.  If you were to take a group up there and kill things, with many classes missing, lots of things would go to waste that someone could use and being that 99 percent of the things that drop in the planes are No-Drop, there is no way that you could get them to someone else.  <br>
<br>
That also makes it imperative that this calendar work and be accepted so that everyone has a chance to go up there, fight, have fun, and get nice items.  Trust me Clept, I have had the opportunity to do the planes on many occasions and I believe this calendar, though originally started as a way for 2 or 3 guilds to stay out of each others way, has become an integral part of server harmony for EVERYONE of planes level.<br>
<br>
If you want to Ally with us shoot me an e-mail and lets talk about it.  Then once you have a chance to really see what being in the Planes is about I am SURE, no I am POSITIVE that you will understand the benefits of this calendar and why it works.  Gimme a tell in game or shoot me an e-mail (you should still have it hehe) and lets chat.  Peace bro.</font><P><center><b>Daraden Bloodstorm</b><br>

I fully understand what you are trying to say... truly I do... and it's not that I entirely disagree with you on some points, but as an older player who CLEARLY remembers what the Planes used to be like I feel the Calendar is by far a better way for the more mature players on the Rathe.<br>
<br>
Foundation Rathe was formed months and months ago (~Feb) by NEED... the only way the 6 guilds who initially comprised FoR to see the Planes was to ally together to have sufficient numbers to FORCE our way in... this was back in the days when we only had 3 or 4 groups/guilds on the Rathe who were doing Planes and those few didnt wish to share with more than that. It wasnt easy... it certainly wasnt pleasant... we did what we had to do to establish ourselves in the Planes and get our &quot;fair share&quot;. I see nothing wrong with folks making alliances to do the Planes =)<br>
<br>
The Calendar of a sorts was already in place... with no formal rules... just post guild name and date and there ya go... Planes Reservation. More and more people started going to the planes and more and more people were posting dates... in the essence of fairness at that time NO ONE was denied access to the calendar... (this perhaps was the problem?) This led to more and more people in the Planes... raids were farther and farther apart for each guild/alliance and while initially this posed no problems over time it created HUGE problems... but then again... there were no &quot;rules&quot; so what was to be done?<br>
<br>
Those people who were posting dates saw the problems and decided to talk about it and formalize some minor rules for everyones benefit. No one &quot;dictated&quot; what the rules were going to be... to everyones credit most comments were civilized and very constructive... and ALL were encouraged to post thier thoughts on what the new rules would be... keeping in mind even those people who were NOT posting were also encouraged to post and have thier voices heard. Over time the first rules were created and implemented.<br>
<br>
Time has passed since those first simple rules were implemented and the 46+ population has EXPLODED on the Rathe... to the point that the Calendar that has kept the Rathe one of the most civilized servers started to collapse. 4-6 weeks between raids was not acceptable as well as some of the rampant abuses of the old rules forced us (everyone on the Rathe) to re-evaluate the rules. Once again everyone was encouraged to post their thoughts on this issues and for the most part this discussion was productive... NO ONE got excatly what they wanted... but when you compromise that's what happens. The Rules as they are now might seem a bit harsh, but with being the only original server not to be split yet we have a VERY high average level of player (toon) and that is what has lead us to this solution.<br>
<br>
What I would like to remind everyone of is a &quot;reservation&quot; for a Plane is more than just assuring your group will have a hassle-free trip (at least from others who honor the calendar)... you are... in essence... asking the other 2000+ lvl 46+ toons TO STAY OUT. THIS is the heart of the agreement on the Calendar System... the Promise made by those of us who agree to this to NOT interfere with anothers day in the Planes. Those guilds/alliances who know the Planes backwards and forwards wont try to zone in and &quot;take&quot; it from you or any of that nonsense... we PROMISE to stay out unless you ASK us to come in using the BB Rules. The Rules as they are stated now might seem a bit much... but then again you are ASKING much of the rest of the population... is it truly so unfair?<br>
<br>
This is not an attack on you Clept... nor am I trying to say because &quot;I'm older I know better than you do&quot;... but the vast majority of the players on the Rathe have discussed this over and over among themselves and posted here (their spokespersons anyway) and have been heard... they have spoken... who am I to tell them they are wrong?<br>

<br>
thank ya naelya, i understand what your saying here, but when i hear things like there will be consequences, i take them as personal threats and being ready for consequences all my life (perhaps thats why im disabled) i become ready to face them.<br>
<br>
i keep hearing things like 99% are in favor, but when i count the people in the guilds that you have listed with all their logos (at the time i forget which page it is here) i see something like 1100 some odd people and thats about 50% of who normally is on the rathe server at a given time in the evenings (im e.s.t. here being in florida) which in fact only accounts to 50%. so i wonder is this misinformation or an exaggeration.<br>
<br>
i understand many have put time into this, im not trying to shoot anyone down here. heck i have more then a few friends in just about every guild i have seen listed here, some guilds listed i dont really want any part with, due to past experiances with them.<br>
seems like you can always tell the younger players by there actions and attitudes.<br>
<br>
but i expect everyone to understand im not here to hurry and level .. be the best armed or armored person on the server, im here to enjoy myself, ive played that power level me and reach the top on other online games and once ya get there .. poof .. it gets boring and soon your closing an account or moving on, so when i hear you will do it our way or else, i immediately go into my wanna bet mode, and become muleheaded and okies lets see bout this, you dont have to agree with me but you do have to realize im here and i have as many rights as any other person out there, and in this day and age of as you put it 2000+ level 46+ players versus the 1100+ you have listed here, perhaps the &quot;there will be consequences&quot; doesnt hold as much water as in the days that there were only 2 or 3 guilds big enough.<br>
<br>
anyone that knows me in game, knows i try to be fair in everything i do, i dont really care who loots what, as the name of our guild suggests .. most of us hunt alone, most of the time, some times a few get together, we dont need numbers to do alot we noramlly do things alone, but we arent to awefully shabby when we pack ..heheh. but from the sounds of the planes perhaps we do need to pack. <br>
 <br>
at this stage i cant honostly say. like i said never been there, dont know. this calendar thing was always a closed door to me that meant i couldnt go.<br>
<br>
but please take my negative approach constructively and learn from it, because as dumb as i am, theres smarter people out there, and like you mentioned 2000+ level 46+ devided in half is equal to what you have listed here in your alliances and thats a number thats growing on a dailey basis, becoming formidal adversaries if they unite to oppose you.<br>
<br>
one more thing<br>
heheh and if they did split the server would you go?<br>
i know im here to stay LOL<br>

but i see now that opposition is up to 5% thats a bit higher then the 0.01% that was mentioned in other posts<br>
<br>
personally i know people in bigger guilds, i wont mention any names but some live in belgium, some live here in the usa some are guildmasters of your guilds and they only subscribe to calendar to go .. they do not think its right, so i ask you .. even though they go, do you really think they are supportive or are they there to just be to able to go? kinda like fair weather friends, if ya know what i mean<br>
<br>
i think if push comes to shove there is gona be alot of surprised people, because your &quot;75%&quot; might in reality be much less then you think, and i think one great big factor will be because of the attitudes and the way you all talk to people here, edwina i wish i had you elagant tongue, cuz i know the way i say things sounds like im digging, but i hope im makin my point<br>
<br>
perhaps trying to pick numbers outa the air is not the best way to go<br>

<br>
This calendar/board is an attempt by the server as a whole to try and work out a way to prevent the planes from becomming respawn farming.  Maybe everyone loves it but you, and maybe everyone hates it and just goes along with it - but the point is that enough players are willing to work within the framework that this board decides.<br>
<br>
If there were truely 5% of the server that believed this calendar was a bad idea - it would be gone; as it only takes a handful of players to force a change.  Enough players do not want a radical change though (as was evident when the first &quot;proposal&quot; was submitted and the outcry went against the way it was written.)<br>
<br>
The calendar is not a perfect system - but it is the best we have.  Again, if you have a better system, one more fair to everyone (large and small guilds, as well as the independant player) PLEASE post it.  Just saying this sux is not constructive.  If you see this system as flawed - then don't just tell us that, give us an alternative.  SELL the idea, and if it is good the system will change.</font><P>Elaundar Nobillium
