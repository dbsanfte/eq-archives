<br>
Forever, the Oceans run on…  <br>
Everything, have They seen…  <br>
Powerful and infinite, They are…  <br>
<br>
Never did the Seas pause to consider.  Never did They inquire about the matters of the world.  Never had They needed a reason for anything under the stars.  They were a god unto Themselves.  Omniscient.  Uncaring.  Existing from no one’s will.  Never needing, never giving, expecting nothing from anyone.<br>
<br>
Alone, on the edge of this endless, stoic Existence, stood a small man, an envious man, staring out upon the Blue Void with sparkling forest-green eyes that seemed to see through everything, seeing all of creation for what it truly was.  Unblinking, he stared across Infinity; and he loved Her.<br>
<br>
It was a burdensome irony that had befallen the short, almost helpless-looking, halfling of a man.  With eyes full of sorrow, he watched as the last remnants of waves lapsed against the golden steel of his armored boots, leaving behind tiny water droplets that reflected the bright sunlight across the sand.  <br>
<br>
He looked at his reflection in the rippling water.  Standing in his green and gold armor he was dressed for battle.  Numerous trinkets and souvenirs obtained from many a fierce battle made him sparkle like a Christmas tree.  Bloodstains he had been unable to wash away speckled his golden breastplate, serving as a reminder of the murderous being he had become.  His rune-covered blade held easily in his practiced hand, it might as well have been part of his arm by now.  A long time had he been fighting, and how he hated it so.  He became deeply introspective, questioning the fateful decision he had made years ago, though it seemed like an eternity…and tears welled up in his eyes.<br>
<br>
A shadow of evil had fallen across the land.  From east to west, north to south, the once green and flourishing continents were now wrought with evil, turning the lands brown and hideous.  Places where nature had once reveled were now brimmed with death, merely ghost-like deserts, calling out to the living in shrieking cries as the wind whistles through the innumerable scattered bones.<br>
<br>
When the drought had begun no one had known it would last as long as it did.  At first it was considered by most to be only a small problem, one which would eventually give way to rain and cooling temperatures, but those who were wise and knew much of nature, usually rangers and druids, knew this was not to be.  Something horrible had begun…something that could not be explained by a mere drought.  Animals had ceased their migrating habits, the clouds had a distinct color difference, almost yellow, and the strong winds from the south, which used to provide cool relief in the summer season, had diminished to, at most, a mere whisper.  Only a few noticed the connection all these things had to the south, how everything that came from the south was changed, changed in a way most disconcerting to even the strongest of heart.  Evil was invading the land and action must be taken to insure humanity’s survival.<br>
<br>
Not everyone shared the opinion of the few, wise people; especially the humans.  In their self-righteous ways they knew not how to take the advice of “obviously inferior” races of people.  Humans had nearly no men of nature to voice the views to them that the halflings and elves had embraced.  Hence it was that as the decades of misery engulfed the lands, the humans, and the disbelievers of other races as well, found they had no shelter, stored food, or any other of life’s necessities, and they were drowned in the wave of evil along with the rest of the planet.<br>
<br>
With much thanks to the knowledge of the earth-digging dwarves, the remaining people of the lands had moved to underground cities, keep,  and had found ways to survive on their own, boiling water from underground streams and finding ways to cook most of the small insects that inhabited the caves so they could be consumed, providing people with the means to live with, surprisingly, relative ease.  Unfortunately, this would not last.<br>
<br>
Very slowly at first, and then spreading like a disease, many of the people began to go mad.  Their seemed no pattern to it except that it usually involved intense sorrow and, ultimately, unwillingness to live.  One would often lock himself in his chambers, never moving from the place until he eventually starved himself to death.  Some, if forced to eat, would one day slowly walk into a river and drown themselves.  Some claimed that the water had somehow become infected from up above and poisoned their people, others thought that it might be from the insects, but none of these provided a clear explanation.  <br>
<br>
The king of the largest keep, a wise and caring high elf, soon realized that it was not a physical impurity that was killing his people, but their need for the sustenance of nature.  Being that a large majority of the keep-dwellers were druids, rangers, or the relatives thereof, they could not remain in a place where there were no trees, clouds, or wildlife, unless you counted the scant bugs and the streams that probed through the caverns.  Again, as was once before ascertained, something must be done.<br>
<br>
The king sent out for 100 of his greatest warriors.  Halflings, dwarves, gnomes, many elves, and even one human, made up the group of adventurers that would partake on the fateful journey which, as the king proclaimed, would save them all from the endless evil which, even underground, was consuming their people.  They could not hide anymore.  The evil, they knew, was in the south.<br>
<br>
Months passed.<br>
<br>
Most had died.  Fights had been numerous and riddled with so much terror that even those who survived would have horrible nightmares for the rest of their lives.  But they had reached the end of the road.  It had all led to here.  Through the ice cavern up ahead and across the dragon-riddled snow dunes was the source of all the evil that had plagued the lands.  A dungeon.  A place where only dragons roamed and none other dared to traverse.  A place of sorcery and hideousness that had not been witnessed by any mortal before.  A place so full of death that not even its walls could contain it, spreading the blackness across the lands, slowly strangling the planet.  <br>
<br>
It was suicide.  The party of two dozen who remained all knew it in their hearts.  There would be no hope of return, no hope of a miracle, and no hope of any chance of survival.  Continue they would, though, through the waist-high snow, fighting dragons and wyverns at every step of the way.  Paying honor their people and to their planet.  And that was how it must end.  That was the only way it could end for them.  They knew they would go insane if they went back to the keep, not only that, but they had lost too many good men and women dedicated to the cause and had gone too far to turn back now.  They were ready.<br>
<br>
And so it was the morning of the attack, that the armor-clad halfling stood upon the shore and gazed into the Sea with envy…the unconcerned Sea, never changing, never ceasing, always at ease.  And it was as he stood there, in his gleaming armor with his scimitar in one hand and his burro’s reigns in the other that he was gently tapped on the shoulder.  “It is time, Daedelous.”  <br>
<br>
And he wept.  <br>
