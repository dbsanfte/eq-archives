I will deem what you did today as Ninja Deleting Ny. No more ninja deleting.<br>
<br>
Don't forget, the admins are admins because they were elected, they can be removed just as easily, you aren't stuck with them. This is not the first time you have abused it either Ny.<br>
<br>
I only posted under that one again because Malaka pissed me off, not remembering who it was that stood right beside her dumb ass when 1.) Tagged along on a raid to get a tear for her epic and 2.) Wanted to join the guild I was in.<br>
<br>
I was just pointing Malaka in the right direction to discover that in Greek her name means &quot;Little shit&quot;.<br>

Besides, say what you want but it's in poor taste to post every damn thing you do in general. If you want on a rot then post it in the rot boards.<br>

Is it that SHE is acting on things herself or that of the RTA Admins collectively? If it is indeed, Nycah Theboardnaziherself, then something should be done. I believe the community as a whole put her into power and came up with the idea of a flame board where &quot;everything goes&quot;.(This of course, excludes stuff which could cause harm outside of the board). If &quot;everything goes&quot; is indeed the purpose of the flame board, then her judgement of what can and can not be flamed should not be allowed. It would also seem to me that if one is put into power, they should be able to be taken out of power. We all have watched this ONE individual assert their power when it has not been needed time after time again. It would be about time that something gets done...<br>
<br>
Now.. It's always been apparent to me that someone who is over-controlling or over-assertive when in a state of authority, is actually missing another part of their life. Is this the case with you, I ask? Upon further questioning, Is the part of your life which is missing that of a sexual manner? I say this because it seems to me that you have some kind of tension built up...sexual? I say we open up another kind of donation box so that we can all put our combined efforts together in order to buy you a device to suppress this problem..Hell, I can name about 200 other EQ players who are suffering from a similar problem, maybe we can help rid of this &quot;epidemic&quot;. In closing, if this is your problem, there is &quot;therapy&quot; out there to help &quot;loosen&quot; you up and if its not, then you and all the other anal retentive, maggot infested, assholes and bitches should log off EQ and go find a sense of humor.<br>

To be honest thats bullshit, I am not here on the RTA by anyones leave but my own, its not Nycah's board ( and she never said it was) so how the hell can it be HER power and we be here by HER leave?<br>

I asked what you meant and this answer:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> W/out Nycah and other Admins, their wouldnt be an RTA board. That easy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

dosen't really cut it, yes voluntary (i.e unpaid) admins of this kind of board do a great job by and large, but theres got to be some kind of satisfaction in it for them otherwise why bother? we didn't MAKE them do it or continue to do it and if they choose to leave they would be replaced by other folk. (there were certainly plenty of nominations for a new board admin recently)<br>
<br>
The comments on the thread should not have been in general, but rather than delete the post/s would it perhaps not have been better to have moved the thread to flames, with an explanation of where it had gone? <br>
<br>
Lukieb,dear, saying things about Nycahs sex life is not on, just because you disagree with something she did on here does not give you the right to say what you did and while I cannot profess to be Nycah's biggest fan, that comment I feel was below the belt (no pun intended <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) <br>

As for the rules as I understand it Flame is anything goes. General, class and other forums need to be pg-13 or less and she has done an excellent job moderating that shit.<br>

BAHAAHAHA!!!!! *wheeeeze* BAAAHAAHAAAH!!!! *gasp* HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHH!!!!<br>

<br>
Thanks, i needed that laugh. Wow, i don't remember asking her for permission when i made my first post on here over 2 years ago. I also don't remember me donating to her to help put this board in gold status. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, our admins do a great job in taking the time out of their own personal lives, eq playing time and in some cases work time to do what is required of them here. Thank you guys for that.<br>
<br>
Des, do you wonder in the slightest why it is that the majority feel that Nycah is abusing her power?<br>
<br>
We aren't all jumping on the attack nycah bandwagon. Hell, i don't post unless i feel i have something worthwhile to say. <br>
<br>
You want examples..<br>
<br>
1: Closing threads at her whim. <br>
<br>
Someone goes back and pulls up a thread that they remember.. &quot;Hey guys, do you remember this? Haha, that was funny.&quot; There is absolutely no harm in that. If i wanted to go back and reference a post regarding an issue.. but i didn't want the post to fall off the ezboard table then i would need to bump it. This doesn't effect EZboard charges, it doesn't effect anyone other then &quot;Hey, i remember that..&quot;. But apparently, she doesn't want to remember these issues. <br>
<br>
Was this something that the admins came down and said &quot;NO MORE BUMPING OLD POSTS&quot;? I honestly don't remember. <br>
<br>
2: Doing things because 'she' wants to. <br>
<br>
Groinlicks post. She censored it - deleted it as if it didn't exist. Did you notice her reasons? Because she did not like it. Not because it was posted in an inappropriate place, not because it was offensive to the general public. but because SHE didn't like it. Go back to page one, she said it right there.<br>
<br>
3: Inconsistency<br>
<br>
Ok, lets give two different sides - you have Drache - which many of us were asking for him to stop with the racial slurs. We had asked for him to be banned, we had asked for him to stop but he did not stop. His actions were allowed for a month or two. Then suddenly, OH HEY he's doing bad stuff lets take care of this so she started to edit his posts of the slurs. That's fine.. <br>
<br>
Then there was a post that involved real life stuffies and that post was moved to the admin forum where they handled it and then moved the post back after being edited. I honestly can't remember who it was that made the comments.. but that was done respectfully and in an approptiate admin like way.<br>
<br>
Now, on the flip side..<br>
<br>
1: Groinlick's (heheh sorry, i love that name it's always stuck) post - removed, deleted. No edit, no this is why this was edited - just deleted as if it didn't exist. <br>
<br>
2: There have been other flame posts on here that i am forgetting the details on that were here one minute and then gone the next. <br>
<br>
My point is, many in the community feel that she is abusing her power as admin. I don't want her to be removed as an admin, but i would like to see a code of conduct laid out for our admins and for our community members. <br>
<br>
Put a sticky in each forum saying &quot;This is what you can post, this is what you can't. This is what will be done when you do not adhere to these rules&quot;<br>
<br>
Then bam.. we can't say she's stepping out of line and if we step out of line she, as well as the other admins have every right to put us in our place. <br>

General should be, and usually is, a place where people can say something without fear of someone jumping on them with both boots. <br>
<br>
Whatever was said, is mostly irrelevent. <br>
<br>
If I posted &quot;hey, we just did something really cool guys, come be happy with us, and share our enthusiasm&quot; and someone posted &quot;yeah, that mob is garbage and all the work you put into it could be done by a good group from a better guild, you shouldn't be proud, you stupid shits&quot; in the general section, then yeah, toss that motherfucking post. It's not meant to be a flame section, and posts that have *nothing* to do with a flame situation, should not get moved because one ass wants to, well, be an ass. <br>
<br>
Not saying that was what was posted, just that mean spirited flames belong in the flames section. If someone's trying to share an uplifting moment in the general forum, why the hell should someone come along and shit on them like pigeons on a statue?<br>
<br>
Abuse of power is a misnomer. Abuse would be banning, or changing the words in the post to be rude. Removal of the post that goes against the rules of the forum is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>use</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of power. That's what moderators do. If it would make you feel better, I will ask Nycah to point me at posts that are inappropriate, and I'll remove them myself. /shrug. <br>

She posted this on the flames board, therefore no proof is required. Proof is actually frowned upon as it may actually lead to an intelligent discussion. Expressing subjective opinions is the purpose of this board, at least in my subjective opinion. <br>

She was not happy with him flaming people on the general board. She was sick of it actually. Just because she was sick of someone who happened to be posting things in the wrong area doesn't mean it was personal. She never SAID it was personal, you just interpreted it that way. I was sick of it too because he did it MULTIPLE times. It was getting old and serving no purpose whatsoever on the general board. If Grul is pissy about something he can go to the right forum and post about how pissy he feels. This thread is proof of that.<br>

Grul, as a poster, has a responsibility to follow the rules of these boards (as do we all).  If you screw up badly enough, you force the admins to do their jobs.  Grul screwed up and he paid the price by having his post deleted from a forum that it should never have been in in the first place. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260261">Barrd Talespinner</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I'll take what you guys have said into consideration.. and maybe i am interpreting it wrong, or jumping the gun..<br>

But is it too much to ask for a code of conduct for both the members of this community and our admins?<br>

so then, you guys can point people like me to it, tell me to stfu and i'll go find somewhere else to bitch about whatever i need to bitch about? <br>
