Which isnt true, they are equal. You need to have the appropriate classes for each.<br>

No... timed it, 22 min... WK is a worthless zone<br>
<br>
3. The &quot;well I will go if you have enough people&quot; line<br>
Seriously... if that person was there it would be one less person we have to get. Why would I ask you to come if I already have enough people?<br>
<br>
4. People think it takes longer to do once you get started.<br>
Ha! Once you have the people you need, you pull the IGs, that take about 20 min. Then buff, maybe 45min to an hour, depending on size. Chat, 15 min once people are buffed, if that. Get back in and walk to the stone while killing the repoped IGs, 20 min. Slay Vox, 3 min. Rezzes, click stick 10 min if people are paying attention, no click stick, tad longer. Loot, I do loot quickly 20 min. So a bit over 2 hours...<br>

If you're running a Vox raid, stick to the 46+ rule. Vox is 55, if you're not within 10 levels of the mob (especially at that level) you're not going to make much of a difference. Sure, some mobs are 70 or better, but at level 60 when you KNOW how to raid, it's a different story.<br>
<br>
Vox is hard because they're open raid only (from what I've seen) and open raids, unless you get a small army of people you know and can trust to listen, tend to be very hard to pull off.<br>
<br>
All I know is that I've taken on Vox 5 times, and we've won all 5 times. If I find I'm in Perma for more than 2 hours and I'm not grouped and we're not even killing IG's, then that's my queue to quietly leave without telling anyone but the raid leader so people don't start spamming me for TL's and ports. You can't try to get people the day of the raid and have it work... you have to plan a few days ahead and have people sign up, which works the best I've found. I hope this helps... =/<br>
<br>
Btw- sorry I had to duck out on you the other day when everyone went LD... I knew that the login server was still acting up, and they wouldn't all be back for at least 30 mins to an hour, and I'd been there for 3 hours already.

It is sort of cool being part of a group to kill a dragon.  After that, what is the incentive?<br>
<br>
*  I have never been on a Vox raid that didn't take away at least 4 hours of my time (maybe I should have been fashionably late).  Most of that is waiting around for enough people.  After an hour of waiting, you start to get attrition, which makes it harder and longer.<br>
<br>
*  You will die.  Well, of course as an enchanter, we are expected to die.  No experience with the Ice Giants (someone had to get it, sure isn't the enchanter group), so negative experience for the 4 hours.<br>
<br>
*  Loot.  Haha.  Someone had to have gotten something.  3 items for 50 people, and the organizers get what they want first (justifiably so).<br>
<br>
*  Guildmates and Friends.  In the end, this is the only reason to go to a Vox raid.  But it was good enough for me to go after my first.  That's why Naggy raids are better organized.  The Ragefire cleric's guild/friends will help to get things going so that Ragefire will spawn.<br>
<br>
If it truly could be done in &lt;2 hours, I think you would actually see more people.  That takes organizational skills.  That takes the committment of your friends and guildies.  That takes having a good reputation for Vox.  Current organizers pay for the mistakes of the people who went before, and the Vox raid has a bad reputation.<br>
<br>
That being said, it is really a very cool thing to be involved in a Vox raid.  Bind at the entrance to the cave, and run back in to see her fall.  Find out who organizes them well, and starts them on time and join when they are organizing.<br>

I have thought about running Vox raids but my experience with how long it takes to get every one to commit to comming out is horribly long (notice I didn't mention the run).<br>
<br>
Also to note about the run, there is an easier way than porting to NK as well. If you can come in with a bard go to TD and port to Halas in the firepot room (or just swim).<br>
<br>
Open raids usually get n00bs who are too low a level to even be there I was on a naggy raid and a 30 monk was there and actually winning loot. He was probably feared and then killed 2 seconds later but he got the loot. <p><center><img src="http://members.accesstoledo.com/david.bowers/sjoc1.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubicrius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bicrius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I need a beer</span><br>  Posts: 3665<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/3/01 2:17:53 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://students.hamilton.edu/2002/bschulte/eqpics/bic_gin_sm.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The problems with Vox are...</span><hr size=1> Anyone who ports to NK is a moron... pardon me, but can't wizards port to WK?

<br>
And, because of that, as it has been mentioned you have to have everybody be 46+ without exception.  The last time I showed up to a Vox raid, well the post-Vaox-raid CR for the CR to help out some; well I saw a level 44 cleric, some warrior around that level and a handful of others that were in their mid 40's.  <br>
That doesn't really work.  I have rarely seen level 50+ people there; well the 50+ people that can help out.  Usually I have heard about or seen the level range be something like 44 to 50.<br>
<br>
Another thing, I think many of these last minute open raid things scare the snot out of me and many other people I know of.  Even though I can't do them any longer, if I could I would stay the hell away from them.<br>
I think a lot of people that have experience killing Vox/Naggy don't show up to those raids then you get a bunch of Dragon Newbies and things just go to hell.<br>
<br>
Also, why in the hell do people still camp out to the chat room still?  I saw that tactic being used 2+ years ago on my old server and people still do that, just kinda confuses me.  Think you would be just as good to buff and run on in, not waste time in chat rooms.  Battle should only last a few minutes, so I doubt you would really save your buffs by being in chat.<br>
But, just my opinion. <p><body>

And by the way the last 2 raids I have gone on I never once got  healed.  What are clerics for if they don't heal on these raids? Is there some new tactic I don't know about? ANd why can't people follow a couple simple rules? Every single admn Naggy radi I have gone on tanks are to run to the back wall and fight there. Yet every single time Naggy gets engaged on or near the bridge. I want to kill those people. Same with Vox. People who do not follow directions should be balcklisted. <br>
<br>
Now I have a 52nd level warrior that would love a dragon haste item. I would love to join every single attempt on these dragons. Can we get a group of people from these message boards that can be dragon slayers? 20 to 25 people max, picking the highest level of all the applicants for this team. Get together every weekend and kill whichever dragon is up or both if possible. Can it be done??? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushjekai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shjekai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/lurk /lurking leeeezard</span><br>  Posts: 534<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/3/01 7:30:29 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://dandalf.com/dandalf/DragonLogo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The problems with Vox are...</span><hr size=1> One more thing...<br>

I've been to one where I counted 4 people in their upper 30's and about 7 warriors/monks who were all between 40-44. That's 11 people who I could tell had no resist gear on, and were candidates for being useless and feared away. Not to sound condescending, but if you're going to a Vox or Naggy raid, don't be so lazy and yell &quot;ME ME ME I WANT A COF&quot; after you were too lazy to spend a few hundred pp on some basic resist gear that would have saved you from being feared or killed right away... <br>
<br>
Naggy and Vox are more than doable with 24 people (or less), but they have to have their acts together, bring resist gear, be of the correct level (aka. 46-52), and need to listen to the raid leader.

Toss a warlord in front of one, a high priest, an illusionist (or whatever the level 60 chanter term is), a master or an assassin, and 2 sorcerrers and you'd see them drop with no problem. Wanna really see something sick? Try it with a warlord, a cleric, a shaman, and a monk... if all are level 60, you could probably take Naggy or Vox with the right people using only 4 of them. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://elementsofpower.20m.com"><IMG SRC="http://webster.ij.net/~eop/newbicsig2.gif" ALT="GIMME A BEER!!

But seriously, do you think it's possible to get a list of say 48 - 52 people serious about getting resist gear and grouping to kill some dragons? I have my warrior at 115MR and 130FR/110CR unbuffed atm and going for more so I am serious about it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usmasharooluclin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Smasharoo Luclin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/3/01 9:17:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The problems with Vox are...</span><hr size=1> ---------Now I have a 52nd level warrior that would love a dragon haste item.

Now let me explain what I mean.  Clerics have the easiest time getting groups..we al know this. Clerics level up extremly fast because it is easy for them to get groups, but, most clerics don't have a total grask of the cleric as a class.  What I mean by this statment is that at lvl 45 a cleric has gone through less than say a warrior at lvl 45 because it's easy for the cleric to get groups and stuff, so clerics tend to not know there class as well as other players at the lower levels (-50)  Don't believe me...think about it...tanks in open raids, and in uber guild do pretty much the same thing...sit there and swing at the mobs, but clerics are different.  In an uber guild clerics do complete heal rotation cycles to keep the main assist alive, they know how to manage heal aggro better and lots of other things.  So to have a good open raid, you need to spend a little time I think practicing with the clerics during the prep, so that they will be ready to save lives.<br>

<br>
Teaching them the cycles with the pauses and the subsequent tell after the pause is key... but takes time, and if people are ignorant or just plain dumb it's not going to work unfortunately. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://elementsofpower.20m.com"><IMG SRC="http://webster.ij.net/~eop/newbicsig2.gif" ALT="GIMME A BEER!!

I have to admit I have ben on about 5 Vox/Naggy raids. I have seen Vox die one time (Bic was there - Raven's scale) and Naggy die 2x. All raids were basically open. I know the basic tactics but I don't know enough to lead. I refuse to accept the &quot;Buff and charge method&quot; as THE tactic for taking out these mobs. There would be no camping to chat or discussion of loot rules. All would be known ahead of time and agreed on. No one would be on the time without proper resists. Everyone would know their job. All would have input but someone would have to make the descisions and make them final.  With the proper planning, which does not nor should it take place entirely in game, this group could log on, get to the proper spot and have dead dragons in 30mins - 1hour.<br>
