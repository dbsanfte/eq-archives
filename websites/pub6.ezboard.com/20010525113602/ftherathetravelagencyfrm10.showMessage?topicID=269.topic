Threats both open and veiled are being tossed around like bad poker chips.  Everyone thinks that their position is ultimately right, and that there is no room for reason.  Planes must be FFA, The Calendar Must be abided by, We didn't have enough time, Yes you did have enough time, blah blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
I realize, the futility of trying to bring everyone onto the same page, and have us all totally agree on any one set of absolute standards.  It's not going to happen people, regardless of what you may think.<br>
<br>
The only option is to compromise, and to adapt.  Enough of this crap, the hipocrosy and rhetoric have to stop now if we want to hammer out an AGREEMENT that we can all abide to.  We have lost sight of what the RTA originally began as.  An agreement between various guilds on The Rathe.  It's gotten to the point where people feel that the calendar is set in stone and there is no room for compromise.<br>
<br>
The latest topic is being skewed and pulled in so many directions, that I think a lot of you are failing to realize what the problem is.  The system is being abused, and there is no enforcement.  You can't just say, ok I agree to this system, then abuse it.  You can't expect people to say, ok I agree to this system, then get screwed by it and stand by idly.<br>
<br>
My guild, on average, hits each plane once a month, twice a month every now and again.  We've abided by the rules, and have honored our agreement to the collective.  However, there are guilds out there that are not upholding their end of the agreement.  If you don't believe this, then stop reading, because I'm not going to be able to convince you otherwise.  If you can at least accept this as a possibility, then realize that the abuses have so far gone unpunished.<br>
<br>
The fact remains, that the system allowed Cazic to stay up for 4 &quot;calendar&quot; days.  One which basically poofed on Thursday because the server came down.  I don't care who's fault it is.  I'm not here to place blame.  What I&quot;m trying to tell you all is that there is a problem and it needs to be addressed.  Can we all agree that it's unacceptable to have Cazic Thule up for the amount of time that he was?  This is not a slam to FoR, they say they didn't have enough time.  The answer then is to find a reasonable compromise so they, and all the bb guilds, can have enough time to kill Cazic.<br>
<br>
I constantly hear about various guilds which are in certain planes many times per month.  Quite frankly, I'm sick of hearing about it.  Mostly, because I tend to internal issues for my guild, and focus my energies directly on my people.  Partly, because there is no path for correction/retribution/resolution.  The Calendar is being abused, and we (as a collective) have no way of enacting enforcement for abuses.<br>
<br>
Want to smear Qwai?  Hey it's a free world.  If the admins are gonna allow it on their board, so be it.  Want to smear Khoros too for his views?  Like I said it's a free world.  You can all disagree as much as you want, but it's not going to fix anything.  Want to point your fingers at CIW and scream bloody murder?  It's a free world.  None of this is going to fix the problems with the calendar.  Sure it might make you feel better, or might make ya look like a &quot;big&quot; person in the eyes of your friends, but ultimately nothing is going to be done.<br>
<br>
I don't really see a answer, without appointing some people who will act as monitors of what's going on in the planes.  But realistically, who is going to want to deal with this kinda crap on a daily basis?<br>

<br>
We could also enact something like maybe that after a guild leaves the plane and if the god is still up the following needs to occur or have occured&gt;<br>
<br>
1. bb guild up gets shot at going in, All the bb has to do is just check with the raiding guild for info.<br>
<br>
2. If bb does not go or is unable to go it is ffa to get to the god at that point. no camping mobs and farming, just first to get him kills him. In and out real easy. <br>
<br>
this leaves the guilds who can kill the god their rights to do so, does not interfere with others raids, and kills all excuses about a god being left up. if he doesnt die no one has anyone to blame but themselves.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufoladen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>foladen</A> at: 2/5/01 3:56:43 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufalconusdawnlight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falconus Dawnlight</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Wog</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>11</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>2/5/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>4:03:26 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://pages.eidosnet.co.uk/~falconus/images/Falc.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: What is the Answer?</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Assonator or however you spell your name, its not overly hard to smear Qwai's name and now Khoros's as they are both so superb of making absolute dicks outta themselves.

This tends to be somewhat self-regulated, more or less due to a sense of mistrust on the server as a whole.<br>
<br>
With the _current_ system there is only two 'abuses' which seem to stand-out.<br>
KEG+BotB, and FoR.<br>
<br>
I won't get into those incidents here, but the former is/was being hashed out in the Guild reps forum, and the latter is being discussed. Sanctioned rules, as Foladen describes would be a good foundation for the ruleset. In the end, though, it falls on the BB's to come to some agreement on how they want things handled with calling them in.<br>
<br>
Your description of the current state of the server is fairly accurate, and the possibility of abuse is deffinitive.<br>

But the reason everyone uses FFA as a weapon is because 12-18 people can &quot;force&quot; their will on the rest of the server.  And calling names will get nothing accomplished.

The facts of the calendar are this:  If *ALL* the guilds don't agree to abide by it then it does not exist.  Sanctions in EQ are like you telling me you're going to kick my ass.  They do absolutely nothing to enhance the situation, nor do they provide a solution.<br>
<br>
Everquest is a lot kids, young adults and grownups (many of whom act like kids...) smashed together in a big pile and forced to &quot;play nice&quot;.  This goes against the grain of what a lot of us would occasionally like to do (aka strangle the living hell out of the person that just trained you...)<br>
<br>
If you want to call FFA Hypocrisy, then do so.  The calendar has already outlived its time by over a year, and it's time to move on.<br>

Sorry Bloggz, that's where you are wrong.  If *your* guild doesn't agree with the calendar, and does anything to ruin it then *your* guild will be dealt with the same passion that we treat the Jamany posts, and with the same passion of the PnP rules you want to enforce.  The rest of us will continue to uphold and mantain the calendar like we have done up to now, and loose all credibility and respect to anyone that carries that guildtag.<br>
<br>
Not *ALL* the guilds agree with the calendar, yet its still here.  Its here because the calendar, with its many flaws, its still stronger and beneficial in the long run for *everyone*.  Something FFA will never be.<br>
<br>
Can we fix some of the flaws in the system? im sure we can.  <br>
<br>
The goal is to make a god rest the very same day that he's born.  A good way to do this is to remove the 2am pst rule WHEN a BB is called. This rule does not benefit me, and it will most likely screw a raid for me every once in a while, but its a rule that will definitely help the gods die faster, and its something that could change things for the better at the moment.<br>
<br>
PS. Notice that even though i did not agree with you, i did not flame you.  I only flame asanine idiots who think that the world revolves around them.

It allows too much bullshit to be accepted as fact.<br>
<br>
&quot;The system is being abused, and there is no enforcement&quot;<br>
<br>
Last I checked NB, RoS, SoT, M&amp;M, DFL, DBN, DF, MFH, and a host of other guilds I don't have the time to check their acronyms (apologies) have NOT been violating anything.  Yet under blanket statements by a host of people here seem to paint a picture everyone and his brother is trying to get away with murder.  This simply is NOT the case.<br>
<br>
We have a very select, small group of &quot;abusers&quot; if you want to call it that.  And even the &quot;abuse&quot; is up for argument.  The majority of us do our days, plan our other raids around our planar dates, and move on.  We focus on the fun of the game, not some odd tally of who is getting what epics at some rate faster than us.<br>
<br>
People like Qwai and others who advocate FFA don't give a rats ass about their fellow players.  They want FFA for one reason, and one reason only - so they can get better and better at not sharing.<br>
<br>
The problem with an FFA system is that it is setup to reward the top farmers.  The faster you can claim and clear VS, Fear, and Hate means you can then move to Trak, Sev, Wuoshi, and Lodizal before someone else does.  And sure, you'll miss out on some of that to competition for a while, but that's what goals are for right?  And the rest of the server can suck eggs as far as the FFA enthusiasts are concerned.<br>
<br>
The Golden Rule and sharing goes a long way, why is it so hard for some to see that?  The more crowded the server, the MORE sharing that is needed, not less.  <br>

It doesnt take a genius to see that right now the problem is the BB system and to me it seems obvious that if any blame is to be put it would be on all the BBs. Quite simply they need to talk to each others and agree on something. The general feelings for those of us that have been following the forum for awhile is that there has been very little communication between the BBs and only when a problem arrive do they sudenly find an interest in the discussion, sadly it takes the form of a flame most of the time. Unfortunately greed seems to be quite the motivating factor here and one can only fear that each BB will require rules that they think they can abide without caring if the other BBs can or not. Understand that no one will stand by rules that would give the monopole to one or two guild. There isn't that many BB right now and its reasonable to expect them to agree on a compromise, the questions is are they willling to ? CIW via Qwai have sang the FFA song so often that they lost alot of credibility when it comes to be willing to compromise. Khoros only added to the thing with his I'm going to do it like this and tough it...kind of post. Guilds needs to understand that their members do carry their tag and though people will understand that the words of one do not necessarly equal the words of the guild they won't be so leniant when it comes to actions. They have a right to expect that any guild have enough control on their members so tha they face the consequences of any actions taken by them. Qwai is a CiW leader and when he speaks here he does give the impression that its the word of CIW. Now I'm not so sure anymore... <br>
<br>
Quite frankly its easy to blame the system but anyone with a tiny bit of objectivity and brain can see that the rules aren't obvious to make. They need to be tried, evaluated and adjusted as needed, it works like that everywhere its no different here. Calling FFA every time you get a chance only show that you are part of the problem and unwilling to help. The calendar works relatively well, the BB system doesnt. You can go the easy way and put the blame on X,Y,Z or you can look at the rules and realise that they could be better. You want the administrators to manage the rules more ? Well give them the tools for it instead of expecting them to do the 30 different expectations that 30 different people have. Cazic stayed up 3 days lets call FFA ? Give me a break... Lets look at the facts and see where the problem lie instead of using this for some childish propaganda. <br>
<br>
The BBs system is at fault, the BBs needs to agree on something and present it here after. whatever is decided though people need to understand that their are circumstances that will demand that the administrators can overlook the rules. Basically :Shit happens, get over it... Not everything is black and white. <br>

We still need the Calendar for Hate and Fear, especially since the God's carry Epic Items.<br>

<br>
FFA is bad. All it does is help the Ph4t get Ph4tter. It leaves all the players that don't make EQ a #1 priority in thier lives SOL. <br>
<br>
If the bigger guilds truly believed in maximizing the amount of epics that enter the game, they would assist the raiding guild without any thought of loot for themselves. <br>
<br>
Alas, human nature dispells any chance the human spirit has at making a completely fair resolution.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for a solution, I cannot think of one that can be fair to all guilds. The only thing I can suggest is some sort of punishment guidelines that will deter future abuse of the calendar system. <br>
<br>
I am proud of our base of players on The Rathe. We have done something NO OTHER server has, cooperate. We may not like each other, we may even wish each other's untimely demise, but we need to respect each other enough figure this situation out. Lets not allow all our progress to dissappear.<br>

However, a certain guild from Japan would not abide by the rules, and they would hunt in the plane.  When it would come to being your turn, you would barely start catching the repops, or even have to wait for them.  So all in all, everyone was left pretty disgruntled about it, so it fell apart.  <br>

This system does work.  It also has flaws that need to be worked out.  Honestly, I have to hand it to Qwai on this.  He stirred up enough ruckus, and now things are finally starting to be worked out.  Whether this was his intent or not, I do not know, but because of all his posts, things are getting done.

I agree with Zachton, this was something that the &quot;BB&quot; guilds wanted, and now they have it.  So, if it is broken on that end, fix it.  Simple as that.  FFA is not the answer, never was the answer, and won't be the answer.  If guilds are being skipped on the BB rotation than I would think two things need to be done, BB guilds in violation need to be skipped in the rotation, and/or BB guilds need to be removed from the list.  I don't think it's fair to blame the many other guilds who are doing their part to live up to the honored agreement of the calendar by issuing threats and ultimatums.  The BB guilds are separate, and if they have issues with their system, than they should fix it, but don't try and cut off our heads because something is wrong in the &quot;Uber world&quot;.  Take some responsibility for what you so &quot;DESPERATELY&quot; saw as important to this calendar system.  Honestly, we have been fighting this issue for so damn long now, and the only major form of belly-aching has been from the BB guilds, not all of em, but mainly from this area.  Why is that?  For being of such a power, why are you so lacking in common sense, common courtesy?  I am sorry if I am not losing sleep at night because a god was not killed on the night he spawned, I apologize whole-heartedly that I have not withdrawn to my closet sucking my thumb in guilt because a select few people are griping about not getting more than everyone else, and please forgive me if I find no ounce of compassion for the fact that you are unable to find a solution to an incredibly small, insignificant problem by not taking responsibility for the monster you created.  I know, I am such a bad person.  With or without the BB rotation, things can and have been running smoothly, and personally, from experience, the BB rotation is one of the few things that's making things difficult.  Amazing, isn't it?  Oh yes, ahem, these are my opinions, they are not the opinions of anyone even remotedly near the city in which I live, and I am sure the mayor himself would deny any knowledge of the night in question, his guild was called in too late anyways. =P<br>

You're saying the only problem with the calendar system is the BB aspect of it?  So all of you believe that guilds are only in the planes on the days they are supposed to be?  What's the rule, no more than 6?  <br>
<br>
Fine, I'm willing to live in your fantasy world for now.  However, humour me.  What should the punishment be for guilds that are in the planes on days that they aren't scheduled for?  Furthermore, what will be considered acceptable evidence of such allegations?<br>
<br>
I already stated what I felt was wrong with the BB system, I have no interest in getting into a debate over an issue that I fundamentally agree with most of you on.  You're spouting rhetoric on an issue that I agree with you on and most of you don't even realize it.<br>
<br>
Now, for the rest of you that believe that the BB system is not part of the Calendar system, why are we discussing it on the boards that were created to maintain the calendar system.  &lt;boggle&gt;  The BB system is a part of the Calendar system, you can argue semantics and wording all you want, but they clearly go hand in hand.<br>
<br>
For those of you that say FFA was never an answer, it was before this calendar was created.  It's still currently an answer on 30 some odd servers.<br>
<br>
Just to make it CRYSTAL CLEAR again.  I have no inherent bias against a calendar system.  I, however, AM against unpunished abuse of it.  If you don't believe that the calendar system is being abused by people hitting the planes multiple times a month, when they shouldn't be, stop reading this post.  It will only confuse you.  If you can or do believe the system is being abused, we need to make sure there are sanctions/punishments/whateveryouwannacallem levied against the abusers.<br>
<br>
Is what I'm stating so foreign a concept that everyone is confused by it?  I'm not talking about RoS, SoT, M&amp;M, DFL, DBN, DF, MFH or any other guilds that abide by the system.  I'm talking about the one's that DO NOT.<br>
<br>
What's it going to take for us to stop lashing out at each other for no reason.  People, I AGREE with a large majority of your opinions and if you READ my original post, you'll realize I am in no need of a lecture from you on your point.<br>
