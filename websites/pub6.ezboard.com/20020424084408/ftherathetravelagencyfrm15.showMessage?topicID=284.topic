He states a presidence has been set by the courst for online games stating that regardless of the rules that persons account could not get disbanded without the company paying an exxorbant amount of cash.  This stems from an event that occurred on UO.....i am just wondering he is stating his right to any zone and to any kill in the game...that is part of the buyer/purchaser policy stating that i have a right to kill and die and enter into any zone in the game...now my question what would keep someone from ohh entering PoF or PoH and start killin in another part while u have already scheduled to be there??  even if he doesnt train u??  also the president was set on the fact that a guy trained a dragon on a large number of peeps and killed a lot...making them lose there gear and etc...now i know that wouldnt happen that severly in EQ BUT i have quoted the policies and he said regardless of it he still could win the suite...so i am wondering am i right or is he right....any feedback guys let me know..or any forum that u know of that addresses this issue....i hate someone telling me i am not right when i know i am pretty usre that someone entering PoF or PoH while another guild is there and has the zone scheduleed to be raided would they get disbanded or ported out???

Anyone *does* have the right to enter into a zone to kill anything they want provided it does not interfere with the group already there.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if that group purposely causes the death or other proplems with the groups already there, then they could /petition and a GM would make the descision. More than likely, the GM would side with the first group.<br>
<br>
All that to say this....these *rules* were set about as a form of civil respect for others. Schedule a date you wish your guild in a plane, and the others in the community will *respect* your time and not interfere. You, by the same token, accept responciblity to do the same.<br>
<br>
As far as EQ getting sued, or the laughable, lose a case whereby they disband/terminate an account...it just wont happen. You paid for the box and the CD, not the pixels you see on the game. You dont own any part of the online images. EQ, as most companies with a leased producted, can cancel your account, your character, or the entire game as they wish leaving you no recourse or compensation for your time invested.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure this is correct, however, if it is not, please clarify. This was simply what I was told by CS after loosing a corpse once.<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Our (The Rathe) scheduling of planes/mobs has zero to do with Verant.  It is strictly a player convention (a player made agreement).  Verant does not enforce player made agreements (our calendar system).  Anyone can enter any plane and kill mobs as they like, by rules of Verant.  It is strictly a player convention on our server to schedule the planes for groups to go into them and all other guilds/groups stay out and honor their raid into them.  So, to answer your question, the only thing that keeps anyone from entering PoF or PoH and start killin in another part while u have already schedule to be there is their honor.  Verant has nothing to do with it (because our scheduling has nothing to do with Verant and they have nothing to do with our schedule.)<br>
<br>
That being said, each server GM is different.  GMs frequently read the main message boards of their servers and some do &quot;go with the flow&quot; of the server.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, you are wrong here.  Again, Verant does not enforce player made agreements, which is what our (The Rathe's) calendar is.  If you go to other servers, they do not have calendars at all and it is FFA/FCFS, which ours would be too if we hadn't started the calendar system early on and defended it against periodic calls for FFA. <p><P>

Doesnt mean you will live very long but a GM can't make you leave a zone unless its for a GM run event or ToT etc. Just because you and a group were here  and THEN a guy enters zone that YOU don't like ,won't get that guy removed from zone. <br>
 But if you go against VI's policy fair play and train etc then as previous posters said you are fair game  with GM . So technically there is no such thing as say Spying ingame etc.<br>
<br>
We all pay same money and are entitled to same service.Oh and i bet if ya read EULA it says something somewhere about the only thing you are buying  is the liscence and box + cd belong to VI..usually something stupid like that lol.<br>
