<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The forest was lit with the lingering evening rays.  The sun was setting somewhere over the tree line.  Giving the forest a soft, amber green tint.  It was that quiet moment in the evening where for just a while, everything seems to have stopped.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There, in a secluded spot stood two people.  A man and a elven lass.  He, a strapping figure, full of life.  Bow slung across his back, and blades sheathed at his waist. She a solemn figure, an elven maid.  Her blonde hair rustling ever so slightly in the gentle breeze.  Tiny lines creased her beautiful face, the only sign of her battle with the sickness that she had been fighting.  Her beauty somehow more apparent than ever despite her long battles against her own body.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The two had been standing silently for a passage of time that could not be measured.  Simply looking at each other with the love that they shared for each other.  No words need be spoken any more at this point.  Everything had been said between them.  Nothing was left but to spend this time together.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The grass rippled softly and the trees swayed to the rhythm of the forest.  Somewhere far far in the distance an owl cried its awakening hoot.  A rabbit dashed through the underbrush.  A fawn and its mother searched for a place to rest for the night.  The forest lived, and continued on its path despite the ranger and the druid.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gently, softly, she finally broke the silence between them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot; I will always love you.&quot; she said, her eyes beginning to tear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;And I you, my love&quot; he replied, shoulders slumping with the knowledge of what was to come.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You will watch over our family ?  Keep them safe ?&quot; she asked, already knowing the answer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He nodded silently. &quot;You know that I will my love.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She gently reached out to him.  Touched him one last time, softly on the cheek.  &quot;I know, I know you will do a fine job.&quot;  She then turned, and summoning the last of her power opened a mystical portal.  A portal similar to one she had opened hundreds of times, but this one different than any of those others.  The glowing nimbus of light surrounded her.  As she stepped into the light she turned to behold her love for one last time.  &quot;I will always love you.&quot; she said to him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With that she took the final step into the portal of light and vanished, never to return.  As the light faded from the rangers eyes, the last rays of the days sunlight faded from the forest.  His eyes brimming with tears he turned from the spot and started his trek into the forest, alone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;And I will always love you,&quot; he said quietly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.showMessage?topicID=82.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.showMessage?topicID=81.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.emailToFriend?topicID=83.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.threadControl?topicID=83.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=83.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=83.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335roleplaying>Roleplaying</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.luclin.com">Luclin.com</a></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
