Youd be surprise how many people that do play female Avatars have reasons for doing so i.e. Aiyanna = RL daughter and Jajuan = me IRL.....made aiyanna when I realized that druids wasnt fun for me.<br>

BUT yes Id guess youd be right about alot of points in your reply gromm, guess I didnt think of it that way but for the most part how I am in game is how I am irl. <p><img src=http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/mestre/Aiyanna.jpg Width=310 height=180></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uroggulbuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 433<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/14/02 5:24:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Something I'd like to get off my chest.</span><hr size=1> I am the same. <br>

Why?  Well, because I knew we were capable of it.. I know for a fact that we are capable of many more things as well that we have not done yet .. and I think to do them we just need to all get things down right and keep working well together.<br>
<br>
That night, we did just that .. We worked together perfect, imo, we had no mistakes.  Hell, we were missing quite a few of key members (about 4 60 war's and all clerics 58+).  But we knew what we had to do .. we had done it before with FK, and we were finally ready to prove that we could do it on our own.<br>
<br>
I remember the post recently on Noble Blades message board, about their first AoW kill, I remember reading this quote on the post, here is a cutout of the message posted by Rokvald:<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
Tonight I remembered an argument I had with a guildie several months ago. We were powerlevelling Dozekar at the time, and we had just gotten wiped for the second time in a row when I began bitching on /gu that we simply weren't gonna do it. We couldn't. It wasn't going to happen.<br>
<br>
Then someone sends me a really pissed off /tel. &quot;It's not your job to tell us what we can't do,&quot; he said. &quot;That job is left up to the people who want to call us Noobie Blade and laugh at us. They get to tell us what we can't do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your job is to see to it that it gets done.&quot;<br>
<br>
We killed Dozekar that night.<br>
------------------<br>
<br>
Now, everytime we (LoM) go on a raid .. I remember that post, and think of it .. This is what told me we would defeat Vindi and Statue that night.<br>
<br>
Do I think this makes us uber?  Hell no .. I don't know that I ever want to be 'uber'.  Do I think it puts us up there right next to the 'top 4' on the rathe?  No, not by a long shot.  Do I think it shows that we have a chance, and that it helped us prove that to others, and most importantly - to ourselves..?  You're damn right.<br>
<br>
To all the people who want to try and tell us what we can and can not do - @#%$ off.<br>
<br>
To anybody who doesn't want to believe we did it ourselves, I don't give a @#%$.  *WE* know what we did, and we are damn proud of it - None of you will take that away.<br>
<br>
For all the congradulations we were given, and still receive to this day - Thank you.<br>
<br>
To all of LoM, I am proud of all of you (us), this is why I joined .. I wanted to grow with a guild that I knew had the heart to do it.  And we will keep on doing it. <p><center><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"  width="236">

<br>
This is Rimcy from little ol Blood of War. Big grats on your kills in Kael. I hope to have our guys go kill some big mobs like that to soon. Blood of War did our first Plains raid last friday in PoG. I am happy to say it was lots of fun and our members did super job. Although we did have invites that helped us, our guys did great job for being there for first time.<br>
<br>
I don't know why anyone would say bad things about you guys on your kills. It does not effect them in anyway that I know of. Guilds helping other guilds does nothing but good as far as I can tell. But you guys did it with no help which just shows that you guys are becomeing better at your game and having more fun to I imagine.<br>
<br>
This may be just my oppinion, but I think everyone on this server should work together. Blood of War has helped several people kill epic mobs and also raided with other guilds. Can everyone imagine just how much we all could accomplish if we all worked &quot;together&quot; instead of against each other? Grats again guys.......great work.<br>

You simply do not know who is at the other keyboard.  Your 14 year old kid sits down and starts typing away in a chat room.  Someone strikes up a conversation and eventually says that they are a 14 year old kid too!  And they live just down the block...  how about you two meet tomorrow in the park?<br>
<br>
I personally never enter true personal information on any non-important (read EZBoard or like things, hotmail email accounts, etc) for many reasons.  I would urge that no one enter that information.<br>
<br>
I had a discussion with some KEG members once where some of them were putting their cell phone numbers in a publicly readable area of their message board.  They told me to shove it and then I explained all the nice things that I could do with their number if I wanted to.  I got a quick apology and the messages were moved to a private board.<br>
<br>
I have always been the sceptical sort but I saw it in action quite a bit back in the early-mid 80s on MUDs, chat-MUDs, and a variety of public forums like those.  The odds of encountering a real female on one of those during those times was almost zero and yet there were numbers of people claiming they were female and attempted to act as if they were.  Some guys are able to act the part convincing enough but whenever I'm in doubt, I ask a female friend to watch the conversations and tell me what they think.  Women can usually tell, better than males, whether someone on the other end of a conversation is female by the way things are phrased and the general conversation structure.  However, people who are generally trusting by nature can get tricked fairly easy.<br>
<br>
If you've ever seen some of BotS postings referring to the 400 lbs. plumbers in their boxers sitting in front of a computer, that's who we all assume someone is until proven otherwise.  The 'net is not a place to wander innocently.  I would seriously recommend to anyone to only enter personal information on sites that really require it, like if you are filling out personel information for work, and then only on secure connections like an intranet (not an internet or the Internet).<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough on that subject.  The main thing is that anonimity affords people a way of saying and doing things that they won't be accountable.  These flame boards are very typical of this.  I seriously doubt many of the people here would actually speak to the person subject of their flame saying the things they would type here.  I'm sure many of them would post here saying that they would, but even then I would still seriously doubt it. <p><p><P>

There are so many good posts here in this thread, I'm gonna take the opportunity to reply to some of it, forgive me for my not so perfect english, if it's any consolation, I speak and write perfect Danish *giggle*<br>
<br>
What is uber?<br>
<br>
Well, to me, uber is when you achieve something you have never achieved before, pushing your own limits and doing what you do in a better way. I guess you can say that learning something new and trying something new is uber to me. <br>
As an example - I am now 52 and I was in village in Velks with one (very beautiful) chanter and one (very charming when played by herself) cleric. They are both lvl 60.<br>
We kept the place almost clean - three quarters of it. Now that's what I call uber, cause I have been there with my 55 ranger (who is now on AB) in a full group and we had a hard time. I had so much fun and I felt like the meanest warrior in the world...well, in village at least <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Wow, real nice post there - one of the most meaningfull ones lately.<br>
(No, I am NOT referring to any of you)<br>
<br>
Let me try to inspire you all:<br>
I work with IT and am among other things a specialist in kids and computers - just recently I persuaded the (uhm..gonna try to make a new word for this, no idea what it's called in english) organisation for all who works with IT...let's call it the Danish IT organisation to allow all members to participate in doing lectures in schools about the net and the fact that kids know too little about who is behind the screen.<br>
Telling the kids to be careful what they do and who they talk to and how.<br>
<br>
This has grown - it started with different members doing lectures at their own kids school and that actually was around 1000 lectures in 6 months - and inspired others to do the same, so today we have a little seperate organisation that gives lectures for free in schools about safety on the net for kids. <br>
<br>
It didn't take many ressources and it doesn't take a lot of time and I think anyone could start something like this, cause we (as in we who work with the net) all know what to be careful of and it doesn't take a genius to tell this to kids in a classroom <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
