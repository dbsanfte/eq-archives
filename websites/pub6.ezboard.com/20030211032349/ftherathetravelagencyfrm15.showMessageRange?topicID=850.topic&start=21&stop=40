No shit there is a difference you dumb piece of trash, but the principal of the two situations is nearly identical.  We are both representing our respective guilds with our actions or words, even if the other members of the respective guilds don't do the same things or say the same things, it's still a reflection upon the guild itself.

Either way, I can't see how I told a lie about you.  I can promise you I really haven't liked you since all that bullshit started and you were so quick to come to its defense.  And it's a well known fact among ex-SoT that part of that movement belonged to you (and the druids.  You should have been a druid).  <br>

It took me a while today to figure out what you were talking about.  And I never saw that thread on the message board.  I just heard about it later.  So, I had nothing to do with the actions that were taken by the GL.  I had no input.  At all.  Whatsoever.<br>

<br>
Can the grammer nazi's who believe that by indicating the errors *that would be unnoticable in every day conversation* really feel they are aiding to their cause? <br>
<br>
If you can't have a valid point, citing the ironies of a misused 'your' is a bunch of bullshit. <br>
<br>
If you have a valid point, poking around at the gramatical side of a post undermines your point, because it detracts from your ability to hit the logical inconsistancies, without the gramatical inconsistancies. <br>
<br>
And finally, while this may appear to be directed against Shogon directly, I'd like to caveat this conversation by saying that it could have been Alinor who said <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Nyca, you DO give a fuck, or you wouldn't reply at all, tool. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
and I would still say this...<br>
<br>
To those people who think that saying anything remotely like &quot;you do care, or you wouldn't reply to the thread&quot; trumps a conversation...<br>
<br>
You need to first eat a large bowl of dick. You then need to pull your head out of your ass. Replying to something does not immediately put it on your &quot;I give a fuck&quot; list. It would be not only stupid to think so, but downright 'short bus' worthy. Even remotely entertaining the idea that replying to something indicates it is on your &quot;flying fuck for sure&quot; list makes you a giant dumbass. G I A N T. <br>
<br>
For example: I do not give a flying fuck when a friend of mine tells me about taking her patients to see a movie. But I still reply with &quot;oh, that sounds like fun for them&quot;. Please note: I have not yet begun to give flying fucks about the patients. Nor will I likely ever. <br>
<br>
Refrain from saying &quot;oh, you obviously care because you wrote this reply&quot;, since the saying of it, and other people's willingness to let you live after saying it will hopefully raise to nearly-intolerant levels. <br>
<br>
No offense to anyone in particular, though I'm sure Shogon is going to get mad at me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Not because he in fact has poor grammar and spelling, but because he has the nerve to be SO fucking ignorant when it comes to grammar and then have the nerve to say that *I* am ignorant in the same fucking breath.  WTG.  Thumbs up!<br>
<br>
Give me a break.  If Nyca TRULY DID NOT GIVE A FLYING FUCK as she claims, do you think she would reply at all?  In all likelihood, she would not.  Get your head out of YOUR ass.  Are you so fucking stupid to not see the irony in the fact that she says she does not give a fuck and yet still continually replies?  Hello?  You go eat the large bowl of dick.  God almighty, why is this such a hard fucking concept to grasp.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For example: I do not give a flying fuck when a friend of mine tells me about taking her patients to see a movie.

<br>
No shit you may not give a fuck, but you don't say that out of respect for your friend.  But that's an entirely different fucking situation.  GG on generalizing something I said and put it into a situation that is NOTHING like the one above. <br>
<br>
Let me ask you, if you were listening to someone insult you in real life, and they continually called you a stupid bitch for example, and you truly DID NOT CARE would you reply with an insult of your own at all?  In all likelihood, no.  Replying suggests that you DO care what they think and or are saying and that is getting under your skin.<br>
<br>
I just think and have always thought that it is rather WEAK DICKED to dismiss something as &quot;I don't care&quot; after you have clearly replied to the person several times, such as Nyca has.  Again, not a hard motherfucking concept to grasp here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=galactis>Galactis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/23/02 3:09:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=850.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: C'mon Nycah, unlock it.</span><hr size=1> <br>

7: Kezz -- doesn't pussyfoot around, tells it strait. deserves credit<br>
8: Schortt -- not much i can say, schortt kicked ass<br>
9: Stelf -- One of the best eq players ive ever met<br>
10: Ngabui -- I really had no opinion about her till recently. very nice.<br>
11: Reb -- i hate reading all that singing stuff, but you're a good person<br>
12: Pacemaker -- good guy<br>
13: Shogon -- not an SoT member, but quite a good person. he may be an ignorant fuck and piss his friends off a lot, but at least he cares about them and doesn't abandon them though he might wish to.<br>
<br>
there are others on both sides, but these names come to mind now.<br>
<br>
galactis: STFU AND END IT, you're fucking annoying. calm yourself.<br>
