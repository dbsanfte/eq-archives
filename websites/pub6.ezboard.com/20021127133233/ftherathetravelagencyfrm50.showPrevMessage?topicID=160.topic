CUSTOMER SERVICE STATEMENT, SEPTEMBER 18, 2002 <br>
Source: EQ Live Website.<br>
<br>
<br>
There have been some rumors spreading around the net like a wildfire over the last few days. Alan Crosby has asked me to pass this message on to you about those rumors. <br>
<br>
Greetings all, <br>
<br>
Rest assured that there is no plan to institute a &quot;pay for Customer Service&quot; model. We have a large staff of over 70 GMs and Supervisors for EverQuest alone and plan to continue with the same level of Customer Support, as part of the purchase price for all of our soon to be released titles. <br>
<br>
Customer service will always be an integral part of SOE's products and while we may not respond to every issue as rapidly as we would like, we do try to resolve them all in time. If you find that your issue has not been responded to, please use the Contact a GM link on the EverQuest board. These emails are generally responded to within 48 hours thanks to the diligence of our Email GMs. In addition, while GMs are available in limited numbers 24 hours a day, you may have the best chance of contact during peak usage hours which are from 5PM to 8PM PST as this is when most GMs are available. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your time and patronage. <br>
<br>
Alan Crosby <br>

Here is the complete story I picked up off another board, of the complete history of what was going on. It even includes the apprentice log. <br>

<br>
--- 2002-07-21 00:44:02 --- The following letter was sent to Aislyn following a rather nasty comment in her WSR for this week. <br>
Greetings Aislyn, As I normally do, I was reading the WSRs that were posted for the week, I happened upon your rather unfriendly statement at the end of this report. Shortly after I noticed this statement, a fellow senior guide read it and came to be very upset about it. <br>
&quot;My guides have expressed concern about our latest crop of appies. I have to agree, some of these guys have no business in the Guide Program. Would it be possible to get another Help Wanted announcement as a MOTD? We’re obviously scraping the bottom of the barrel right now. &quot; <br>
You need to keep in mind that all candidates are graded exactly the same way that you were when you filled out the guide application, and that the grading team chair is indeed a senior guide who has access to statements of this nature. Statements like this can only cause harm. Now and then an apprentice guide shows some signs that they might not be made of gold, this is where you the senior guide, and where your guide trainers are most effective. These apprentices should be given a little extra help in learning how to become better Apprentices and ultimately better guides. Not one single one of us started out knowing everything, we all learned it from the training teams, and the SMT collectively. <br>
In the future, please refrain from derogatory comments of this nature. <br>
<br>
--- 2002-07-22 20:21:26 --- Email sent to Aislyn: <br>
Greetings Aislyn, It has been brought to our attention that while on your play server you made it quiet obvious to the Guide you spoke to that you were in the Guide Program. In this conversation you directly quoted sections from the P&amp;P, mentioned the P&amp;P itself, mentioned the SMT, and the shadow aspect of the Program. <br>
<br>
This violates the section 5.4.1 Off Duty <br>
<br>
This means off duty CS Representatives do not identify themselves, in any way, shape or form, as CS Representatives on their play server, particularly when requesting assistance via the petition system or direct tells to the CS staff on the server. Off duty = normal player. <br>
<br>
This is a serious and fundamental breach of the P&amp;P and in the case of a Guide would normally result in their dismissal. In this case however, we feel it best that you be given a formal warning. If another breach of the P&amp;P occurs then a demotion or removal will be considered. <br>
<br>
--- 2002-07-22 20:35:09 --- Below are the logs of the Apprentice Guide and Guide conversations with Aislyn as a player on her play server: <br>

[Sun Jul 21 02:53:01 2002] Taidin GMSAYS, 'You can do that. Also direct them to the naming policy.' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 02:53:14 2002] Taidin GMSAYS, 'Really no sense in leading them to believe the name will be changed.' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 02:55:02 2002] You told Lelorinel, 'Hail and well met, Apprentice Guide Ithin at your service - What is the surname of Specters?' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 02:55:44 2002] Lelorinel tells you, 'couldnt tell, just had that firstname, saw it in shouts in GBay.. however it is in violation of 8.3.2.11 I believe' <br>

[Sun Jul 21 02:58:37 2002] Lelorinel tells you, 'It violates 8.3.2.7 which clearly states Proper names from Everquest. This also includes the first or last names of any significant RQ NPC. Read your P&amp;P Appie. this will go to your SMT' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 02:58:52 2002] You tell your party, 'Need a guide check on Lelorinel please' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 02:59:19 2002] You tell your party, 'Possible hazing of sorts /cry' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 02:59:45 2002] You told Lelorinel, 'Specters is not the proper name of any EQ NPC.' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 02:59:49 2002] Taidin GMSAYS, 'Ahahaha. That's Senior Guide Aislyn. What'd she do?' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:00:22 2002] You GMSAY, 'Telling me that it violates 8.3.2.7' <br>

[Sun Jul 21 03:00:53 2002] You tell your party, 'And then said Read your P&amp;P appie. This will goto your SMT.' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:01:06 2002] Lelorinel tells you, 'yes Appie, your shadow as in the guide who should be watching over you while you are online. If you are online without a Guide+ watching you you'd better camp now' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:01:14 2002] Taidin tells the group, '@#%$. /report that.' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:01:35 2002] You told Lelorinel, 'Taidin is my guide online' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:01:36 2002] Lelorinel tells you, 'yes and tell Taidin I would very much like to speak with him' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:01:47 2002] You tell your party, 'Lelorinel would like to speak with you' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:01:54 2002] Lelorinel tells you, 'thank you please esc this to yellow for Taidin to handle, tell him I was being testy with you' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:02:12 2002] You told Lelorinel, 'I told him you would like to speak with him.' <br>

[Sun Jul 21 03:02:32 2002] You told Lelorinel, 'For future reference, spectre is not a proper name /smile' <br>

[Sun Jul 21 03:05:07 2002] You tell your party, 'reported all of that' <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:05:14 2002] Your strength fades. <br>
[Sun Jul 21 03:05:25 2002] You tell your party, 'including where he told me if I was online alone I should camp' <br>

[Sun Jul 21 01:04:47 2002] You told Lelorinel, 'It's not a proper name from EverQuest. A spector is a type of mob. But I don't believe there's enough of an implication to suggest the player is claiming to be a spector.' <br>

[Sun Jul 21 01:05:56 2002] Lelorinel tells you, 'hmmmm OK tell you what...I want you to read the most recent Name Policy as outlined in 8.3.2 and 8.3.3 OK, if you still disagree with me, dotn post it for GM ignorage, if you do agree, then post it' <br>

--- 2002-07-22 21:36:21 --- Removed the below post from The Senate: <br>
To all of our Elders to join us at a Seniors Meetings... the one we have every other Thursday evening... and help Jessla with some of the questions we've asked, but, having been by herself, was not really able to answer for us. Many of us have questions for the Elders and it's not fair to Jessla to put her on the spot, as I feel I did at the past meeting. That is why I would like for all the Elders to join us, or, barring that, a contingent who represent the Elders, who CAN answer our questions we have put forth. I honestly feel that once we are all on the same page, and understanding in clear, we can begin to get the work done that needs doing. If Brasse brings the booze, I'll make some treats =) <br>
<br>
--- 2002-07-22 21:46:54 --- Aislyn made a few posts over the last month demanding that Elders account for their time to the Seniors and displaying what seems to be a lack of trust in our leadership. With this in mind, she was removed from the Policy Team as we need to work closely with the Elders and have a high degree of mutual trust. The following letter was sent to her by way of explanation: Greetings Aislyn, After reviewing some of the posts you have made recently, as well as the log of the last Senior meeting, we feel that you would not be very happy on the Policy Team. The Elder Guides are the 'bosses' of each and every Senior and Guide in the Program. They direct and guide the program in a direction that will help the program to grow. They have a much better, overall view on a program-wide basis than any of us can ever have. With this in mind, they have final say on each and every policy that we work on. And we don't question their final decisions. Yes, we can make sure they have added into the equation all of our collective experiences, but we rarely will be given the information that they have access to, both directly from SOE Management and from Dev and from other groups in other areas that is considered priviledged information. We just have to trust their judgement. After reading your posts and comments, we don't feel that you could be happy with that arrangement. It seems to us that you need to know what they are doing, why, how, when, etc. We can respect that. But that isn't the kind of information we will ever have access to as we are writing, rewriting, and modifying policies. On the team we have to have trust in our leadership. Please understand that while we respect your opinions and views, we feel it would be counterproductive to have you on a team where you would have to work closely with the very people that you seem to have issues with. With this in mind, your access to the boards and Policy Team emails was removed. We wish you well in your endeavors! We hope that you understand why we feel this move is best for all concerned. <br>

--- 2002-08-26 18:39:36 --- Aislyn's recent post on The Senate. In reply to the announcement that Star War Galaxies will not have a guide program, another senior replied &quot;is anyone really surprised by this?&quot;. To this Aislyn replied with: <br>
<br>
But it begs the question... if players are getting bad CS in EQ are they really going to move on to another Sony product with bad CS already being touted? It's something I honestly think they should consider. <br>
<br>
--- 2002-08-26 19:45:09 --- Following several violations of the policies, Aislyn has been demoted from Senior Guide, to Guide, and given the opportunity to transfer to another server. <br>

--- 2002-09-15 18:26:02 --- During a conversation with another guide, Aislyn indicated her intent to cause damage to the Guide Program, Volunteer members of the Guide Program, and the Head GM for the Guide Program. <br>
**** Statements from this conversation are as follows: <br>
***** &quot;I've been kept informed and will be after I leave, my main goal right now is to get rid of Brenlo and the Elders&quot; <br>
***** &quot;LOL they did all the work themselves, I just have to get them served and publicly ostracized... easy work when people listen to you in certain places&quot; <br>
***** &quot;once this cat is out of the bag the guide program as it stands now will be pretty much over&quot; <br>
***** &quot;people are going to hate me for what I will do, however, Im doing it so that we can get back to helping players and stop dealing with the political BS&quot; <br>
***** &quot;LOL oh you have seen nothing yet... I can do far more damage outside than I can internally, so I am retiring to do just that&quot; <br>
***** &quot;nah, that heart was killed with the new Elders... I plan on a transplant tho... I may or may not be back&quot; <br>
Guide has been removed from the Guide Program and should not be permitted back. <br>

What Sony Doesn't Want You To Know <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
You guys have heard me ragging on Guides and GMs in the past few weeks, and really making fun of EQ Customer Service in general. However, I have a confession to make. I am posting this here as this in the one place I can assure Sony will not be able to have the post removed. <br>
<br>
For the past year and a half I have also been known as Guide Aislyn on the Tholuxe Paells server. Yes, your *cough* beloved *cough* guild leader was a Guide. Not only that, I proudly served as a Senior Guide for 3 months... before being demoted. <br>
<br>
Yes, you guessed it. I was demoted and removed as a guide because I will not keep my mouth shut when I feel something needs to be said, and not only said, but shouted from the roof tops. The subject I touch on here is one near and dear to my heart, and that is Customer Service to the players of EQ. <br>
<br>
When I was demoted and it got out as to why (I will go into this later) many asked why I was not removed. It was because of this very post. I just became a larger liability to the vaunted Powers That Be in SOE Customer Service. My gag is off and I will NOT be silenced. If you are from Sony and reading this post I ask you one thing and one thing only... prove me wrong. I rest assured that you will not. <br>
<br>
The whole thing came to a head the day I was promoted to Senior Guide. My birthday as a matter of fact. That was the day it was announced to the guides in the programme that servers would no longer have a GM assigned to them. We would hence be blessed with a roving band of GMs who would come and blast away the red petitions (GM only) and the customers would weep with their good fortune. Oh, players wept allright. They wept in frustration that it now takes a month to get an issue resolved, if it gets resolved at all. <br>
<br>
This is how it was supposed to work (and remember this was after they RIFed about 10 GMs) you would have a cluster of approximately 7 GMs who each had different responsibilities and two GM in this cluster who were just there for Guide Contacts to handle server issues. Each cluster has a Lead GM. These clusters were assigned to approximately 7 to 10 servers. And then there was one cluster dedicated to handle e-mail from the Contact Your GM link on the EQ site. GM Breave is the lead GM of this group and handles an ungodly amount of email. This lady gets work done. <br>
<br>
Well what happens? Servers are ignored for weeks if not months and players and guides begin to complain. Players are petitioning day after day with no resolution in sight. Finally they give up. GMs quit in frustration. The guide programme begins to hemorrhage at the rate of 10 guides per day. Senior Guides (the administrators of each server) begin to leave in unheretofore seen numbers. Each week we are told to hang on, things will get better, we just need to get used to the new system. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile the Grading Team Chair, who is in charge of making sure the applications for a Guide Position are properly graded so that we continue to have incoming guides for the ones who retire is told by Brenlo and Ledian in Team Chair meetings that they cannot put a Help Wanted message in a MOTD on servers or in a Patch Message because... wait for it... the developers cannot work it in. Yes, evidently the developers of EQ, the most wonderous game online, who can create the wonders we daily experience, cannot put a TEXT MESSAGE into the numerous ones we witness, like today's ad for the EQ store. In my time as a Guide we went through 3 Team Chairs on the grading Team. But as it stands now, they have graders waiting for applications that Sony does not want coming in. Sony doesn't want new guides. They dont want a Guide Programme at all. No, free Customer Service for their product is a pain in the ass, and they will no longer support it. This is amazing considering that after Brenlo's major @#%$ up of spawning Ragefire for two whining guilds on another server got out and they put the shards to spwan Ragefire into the next patch post haste when other players noted how this was unfair. Amazing they can do that and yet not put up a text message. I stand in utter amazement. <br>
<br>
Thus begins the history lesson. Before EQ, 989 Studios/Verant had an online MMORPG that was a tank shoot 'em up. Not many people remember this game. The name isn't important (must not be, I can't seem to remember it myself), however, this fact is. When EQ beta testing was announced they dropped customer service on that product and let the game die. By the time EQ went client, the tank game was a fond memory (Kinda like Meridian59). Anyway, guess what was announced last month? SWG is going into bets testing. Guess what is getting @#%$ canned in EQ? You guessed it. The mental giants at Verant(SOE) decided they will kiss EQ goodbye because we're all going to SWG and EQ2. <br>
<br>
Now, who remembers Legends? Show of hands? Good. Legends was not a haven for the Uber at Heart. Legends is a marketing experiment. Once again you begin to see the light. Last month Brenlo announced there would be no Guide Programme for SWG. Guess what kind of Customer Service they will have there? You pay for premium service, say $40 a month and you get 24/7 Customer service. Any bells ringing yet? You don't pay for the premium service, then you can e-mail your complaint to someone who cares, only thing is, Verant/Sony isnt planning on hiring these caring individuals because they... cost money. <br>
<br>
When I drew this perilous, heretical parallel I was demoted from Senior Guide and given the opportunity to transfer to another server. Uh huh, yeah, right Elder Guide Jessla. I wasn't demoted for being a @#%$ all, do-nothing Senior Guide. I was demoted for touching on a TRUTH you don't want the public to know. And BTW, I own this board, so don't bother e-mailing me asking me to remove this post. I'll shove that missive so far up your ass you will be reading it from inside your stupid one glial celled head. <br>
<br>
Now, let me touch upon the ineptitude that resides at the highest echelons of Sony Customer Service. There are the employees of Sony, idiots like Brenlo, Mr. No Jessla and Agnieska are NOT Elder Guides because they lived in my house! And the volunteers, Like the Elder guides. Elder Semiconsious, as he is fondly referred to in the halls of SOE in San Diego, and Pending, then there are Jessla and Agnieska, two women who are so inept that a word has not yet been coined to sufficiently describe their stupidity. Jessla, in her infinite cluelessness actually locked a thread on the Common Hall (General Discussion Guide Board) written by a soldier in Germany who happens to be a Guide extolling the virtues of those who have given their life for the cause of freedom since 9-11. Yes, dangerous post, Jess. Seditious in it's very patriotic message. One Elder guide resigned after her attempts to get Agnieska and Jessla removed went nowhere. Her crime? She cared about the guide program and the players who would be effected by their stupidity. <br>
<br>
Let me tell you why the Elders hate me. Shortly after becoming a Senior Guide I made a post asking why, after 3 years, the Elder Guides had no policy in the Policy and Procedures regarding their accountability. Everyone is accountable to someone in the guide program, so why not them? I was basically given a song and dance routine reminiscent of Vaudeville, with one guide going so far as to say that this is not a democracy. I was also written up for inviting the Elders, all of them, to a Senior Guide meeting, which we held every other week to discuss issues, because it was &quot;sarcastic and degrading&quot;. My post was not either of these things. I mentioned that Jessla was the only Elder I ever witnessed and it did not seem fair to keep heaping all of our ire on her as she was not the only Elder Guide in the program. Another Senior Guide made another post saying the exact same thing mine did and he was not rebuked or in any other way reprimanded for his post. Selective reading? I think not. Jessla had Agnieska do this task as she was insulted and degraded by my invitation to the other Elders so she would not be beat up on all alone. I sometimes imagine her crying at her desk reading that post. <br>
<br>
Shortly before being made Senior Guide Brenlo told the senior guides that they would no longer be able to change first names and there was a programming snafu and only GMs would be able to do first name changes now. Two weeks later the Pay For a Name Change was announced. Brenlo admitted to &quot;misleading&quot; the Senior Guides and apologized. Great Mea Culpa Bixie. Shows how foreign that particular action is in your life. Since then the program has been losing guides and seniors at a fairly brisk clip. <br>
<br>
Guides are sick and tired of taking abuse from players because their GM Only issues never get resolved. Remember Darissa? She was also Sandpiper. A few weeks ago she quit the game, returning all the items I had ever given her. She had been a guide for a few months on the Povar server. She quit because of all the abuse she'd taken from the players. She found herself unable to even log in to play. She was a great guide. That's the kind of people they are running off. When I was a Senior Guide it was nothing to spend 30 hours offline handling administrative issues for my server. I was on ICQ nearly 24/7. My email box was constantly full. And I still managed to do 11+ hours a week online handling online issues. I was back guiding one week after my miscarriage because Senior Guide Glaiven told me I needed to get back to work. This is the kind of people they are running off. <br>
<br>
The question that stuck in my mind was why? Why run off their free customer support? Why did they keep kicking us when we were already down, nearly out? <br>
<br>
Premium Service baby. You're gonna have to pay to be ignored in SWG and EQ2. Bow down before the one you serve, Sony. You're going to get what you deserve. <br>
<br>
Thank you, but I will not ever slip into mediocrity to please others who worship at it's altars while trying to hide their Peter Priniciple. I'm out, glad Im out, and praying that someone pulls their head out of their ass and helps the dedicated guides and GMs who do this because, despite it all, they still think they can help players. Think about that next time you file a petition that never gets answered. Maybe they all got fed up and quit, and the GMs are all in a meeting listening to Brenlo talk about how great he is to have thought of the entire scheme while keeping all us mushrooms exactly where he wants us. <br>

She was being abrasive, yes. She was going against the guide rules in her encounter with the apprentice, yes.. <br>
<br>
But she was doing it for a reason. She even states that many of the guides don't know what the hell they are doing. She is trying to stress to these guys that everyone there needs accountability because there IS wrong doing going on within the guide program. <br>
<br>
So, she tested an apprentice guide. She got bitchy in some emails/posts and she got fed up and gave us, &quot;The Guide Program, Exposed!&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't blame her for wanting to take them down..i foresee her outburst helping the guide program to hopefully do a little behind the scenes cleanup on some issues that shouldn't of happened. <br>
<br>
Personally, all i've ever asked for is when you have an issue and a guide helping you.. for the love of God, please make sure the guide isn't a COMPLETE moron. Recently, my roommate was working on his epic at sea furry island and the corrupted, tainted whatever was not spawning after an exorbinant amount of time there. <br>
<br>
The response from the guide, &quot;There is no such spawn in that zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
O_o WTF?!<br>
