<br>
I've been laughing so hard lately I just couldn't keep it bottled up any longer.  I tried to amuse myself any my guild for about an hour making a parody of your &quot;news&quot; post with what the post would have been before you hired the Iraqi Information Minister to write it for you but it wasn't enough to satisfy my need to laugh, although it did provide quite a few laughs and helped a bit.  I figured I could find more amusement for a lot of folks by stiring up some crap on this board since it has been pretty lame for a while.<br>
<br>
First, we weren't &quot;cheated&quot; out of anything.  I don't know what dumb shit thought brought up any idea that we were &quot;cheated&quot; out of anything.  Just more dumb shit yapping trying to divert the funny shit of getting called out.  Who cares, you &quot;killed&quot; some pixels on your screen.  I wonder how many of you have slings on your arms from spraining them patting yourselves on the back.<br>
<br>
Second: &quot;Anyways, this post was only made because you're sad that Verant has cockblocked all of EQ from progressing past the RC and we're catching you day by day&quot;<br>
<br>
LoL... whatever.  You'd think we'd be annoyed with SOE (not Verant anymore), or the encounter, or ourselves over it.  Why the hell would we care about other folks advancing?  Same thing happens every expansion.  We get to VT and folks are advancing towards VT the whole time but there is nothing left for us to do.  We clear ToVN 50 times before SoL came out because there was nothing left to do.  Meanwhile, everyone else is advancing to that point.  Mortalis must have given you egos along with the strats.  Maybe next time you should ask them for some common sense and a few IQ points instead.<br>
<br>
&quot;We were the first ones on the server to kill the pre nerfed Arch Lich and we developed our own strategy which *GASP!* involved one tanking and ranged damage! HOLY SHIT!!1!!1&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, that was probably the last original strat that you actually had, but I would prolly bet even money you had that given to you as well, given the latest situation.<br>
<br>
&quot;We know we're on your asses and you know it too but theres no need to be a stupid fuck, we killed him. Loko didnt solo him with l33t cleric nukes. Look forward to Xegony and Coirnav money shots on the Tindi front page before you see RC go down on The Rathe. Start thinking up your next bullshit excuse now so it's good when you need it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, I would say that you are all on Mortalis's asses... nose first with Loko leading you there.  Yeah, I look forward to those shots as well and will &quot;gg&quot; you on them too.  Just remember to thank Loko and Mortalis when you do so I won't get to laugh as hard at you again.<br>
<br>
I just find it extremely funny that you guys claim to be all l337, and have for a while, when all of &quot;your&quot; strats are given directly to you by Loko, who used to be in Tindi, who went off to join Mortalis on Venril Sathir (that server's #1 guild) who then logs onto the Rathe using borrowed accounts to explain and help with the strats.  The only *real* question is whether you guys got him to transfer and join just to find out some strats or just figured out that he was your best source of strats available to you after the fact.<br>
<br>
What's even more funny is what you have posted yourself and you didn't even know it.  You posted a perfect example of where we did have a little help and gave some credit for it while at the same time admitting that you got help, but look at what your board has posted.  Hint: it's the way you say it, not what you said.<br>
<br>
The difference is that *lots* of folks, not even in BotS but several other guilds on The Rathe, have known about the &quot;Loko Connection&quot; for some time and have been laughing at your posts of &quot;our strats&quot; and how you've been &quot;looking them over&quot; and such silly drivel.  I just couldn't keep the laughter bottled up anymore and have let the cat out of the bag that we all know so you don't have to hide it anymore.  I've probably spoiled what could have been a lot of laughter for time to come.<br>
<br>
Other than being somewhat tipsy right now, I have no idea why I'm even trying to explain anything to a bunch of folks who will find it impossible to understand.  I just figured there hadn't been anything good in Rants for a long time so I figured to stir up a shit storm over something I (and lots of others) found funny as hell.  Funny thing is... now that it is out... every time you do something, someone will always wonder if Mortalis gave you the strat or did you do it on your own.  No one will ever be able to know because of this hilarious stuff.  And... what is really funny is that every time you post anything, you know what folks will be thinking about what you post.<br>
<br>
So... if you gotta hate someone for it, hate me for spoiling the rest of the server's fun at reading your upcoming Xegony and Coirnav kill &quot;news&quot;.  Gratz on yer lewtz guys!  Goooooo Magelo!  Enjoy your Mortalis given strats (not just Fennin Ro but for the previous and future strats as well).<br>
<br>
/wave Loko<br>
<br>
Don't be so shy next time you log into The Rathe.  Send us old-timers a /tell so we can say hi.<br>
<br>
God, why am I wasting time on nitwits when I could be doing something more useful and rewarding like... removing bellybutton lint or something.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it was high time for a good flame thread to get started.  This should provide entertainment for at least a week... maybe two.  BTW:  I expect to see something about me mentioned on your news boards soon in reference to this.  Please don't disappoint!  And keep up the good work.  Everyone needs a laugh sometimes and this has definitely been more entertaining than the movies I've been watching lately.  Oh... and if anyone wants the link to that parody post I made, send me some email and I'll send you the link. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twyzzlyrnecromite>Twyzzlyr Necromite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/27/03 1:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1160.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .....</span><hr size=1> Yes fuckhead.

Before you get all huffy about the other guilds helping with strats, maybe you should look at some of the members in your own guild.

<br>
What I dont understand, is how you feel it is within the realm of normalcy for you to ridicule someone for doing something you yourself have done. <br>
<br>
Now, I am well aware that you will write me a book, SssSSssSssssSssssssSSSSsssSsSsorn style, that will try to talk circles around me and tell me how you are right and I am wrong without offering any real information aside from insults and propoganda.  However, what I do not expect to see,and what I want everyone else to LOOK for, are responses to the following.<br>
<br>
1) How is it that it is SO funny to you now.  But when your guild had a foreign injection of strategies that increased your killable mobs instantaneously almost it was all hunky dory? Perhaps you simply feel the need to stir up shit because you have an inferiority complex in real life.  I don't know, I dont knw you in real life.  But I do wish you would follow US around and take screen shots like you did a year ago with SoT.   I do so miss the BotS paparazzi.<br>
<br>
2) Do you really, honestly, truely, in whatever part of your anatomy you use to think with, believe that any idiot could not walk up to Fennin and go &quot;shit, he has AE rampage, perhaps we should not send 173294912 uncontrolled melee at him. Furthermore, perhaps we should do something ELSE with those melee&quot;.  In continuance of that line of thinking, do you further believe that the other BLATANTLY OBVIOUS abilities of Fennin Ro could not be seen in a single attempt and a strategy put into place on the NEXT attempt to circumvent these abilities (none of which are unique to Fennin, all of which have a pretty standard way to avoid)?  Can you be so arrogant as to believe that only someone with a BotS tag could put into place a PROVEN strategy (hello, McFly, the Fennin strategy has been used almost verbatim with another mob WAY before Fennin) and execute it in an add free environment such as it is?  Can you be so Strident?<br>
<br>
<br>
As for &quot;making loko transfer&quot; or whatever you said.  You been hittin' it a little to hard there alchy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tindimonk>Tindi Monk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.badassbuddy.com:8080/images/buddies/badassbuddytrain!.gif_com-" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/27/03 2:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1160.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Who cares, you &quot;killed&quot; some pixels on your screen<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

i can answer that, go to work from 8am till 5pm, go to sleep, wake up aorund midnight, log on to EQ and play till morning, loko is a European player, who has sacrificed so much in order to play EQ on the mainstream USA times and finally just couldnat take it anymore so he severloged when giventhe chance to join into an enviroment which could better suit his needs. i believe that none of tindi hold harsh feelings to any members who leave due to conflicts in time zones as i know i personally could never do that and i would hold disgust towards them if they did.<br>
<br>
as for these &quot;connections&quot; across different servers, can you tell me for a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>fact</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that you, an officer of bots, have never taken any tips from say a RL friend or cross server friend, a hint from a guildate who had RL friends in other guilds, or anything else? i can guarnatee you 100% that you have even if you didnt know it so guess what, YOUR GIMP! it is a spider web of these connections going from one server to another and all starting from the most part, FoH / AL guilds and such. hell, you can not have ANY friends and look at different screenshots to look at positions of mobs &quot;of where they die since its not likely that they will kite it to a different spot to die at, and also *drumroll* spells that the mobs casts that have an icon. <br>

Here ill guide you through it, its really simple. go to www.fohguild.org hit archives, next go to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://fohguild.org/news/Xeg.jpg">fohguild.org/news/Xeg.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> now look at the Screenshot, you see that red box that says <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>wind of xegony</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> , you remember that, go to lucy, put it in and tada you just got a crossserver help from FoH! you must think im gimp for doing that since im sure NONE of your officers would ever do that.<br>
So if you want to swing your cock around and live in the ignorant bliss you have created for yourself, go for it, but when reality hits ya let me know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twyzzlyrnecromite>Twyzzlyr Necromite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/27/03 2:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1160.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .....</span><hr size=1> Just to add...if you're so not worried about Mort's strats getting to us...then what was with the pathetic attempt of getting their officers to forbid Loko from speaking to us?

I consider Gromm to be a pretty intelligent person. As a matter of fact, listening to him in the RTA channel leads me to believe he is probably more intelligent than 90% of us all. He has plotted this flame pretty damn well. It started with members of his guild taking pot shots in tells, then you making a post in the “teamwork” thread. Now, after carefully plotting your attack, you unleash your full frontal attack, trying to take advantage of people by insulting the thing they hold most valuable, their guild.<br>
<br>
I have to hand it to you, it worked wonders. You struck a nerve in many people. Because they were so angry, some of their responses are not thought out and off the cuff. This gives you even more ammunition to lash out yet again. You my friend, are a true strategist. But allow me to set a few things straight…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I tried to amuse myself any my guild for about an hour making a parody of your &quot;news&quot; post with what the post would have been before you hired the Iraqi Information Minister to write it for you<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wow, so I am the Iraqi Information Minister? You make that comparison based on one sentence in my post…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well during the last few weeks since our attempt, we have really been looking at our strat.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You make fun of how we developed our strat, however you have absolutely no clue. No one has denied the fact that we had help in researching the encounter. I have never posted otherwise. In fact, I can’t remember a time I have waved my dick around for all to see. But when you try to say that we did nothing but follow a strat spoon fed to us, I call bullshit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yeah, that was probably the last original strat that you actually had, but I would prolly bet even money you had that given to you as well, given the latest situation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This type of comment is the kind of thing Gromm is famous for. He always takes the guilty until proven innocent route. I can’t count how many times I have seen it. He sits on his high horse, judging everyone on everything. Never once does he care to comment on his, or his guilds mistakes. Because when they are in the wrong “it’s an honest mistake.” But when anyone else makes the same mistake, it was intentional.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I just find it extremely funny that you guys claim to be all l337, and have for a while, when all of &quot;your&quot; strats are given directly to you by Loko, who used to be in Tindi, who went off to join Mortalis on Venril Sathir (that server's #1 guild) who then logs onto the Rathe using borrowed accounts to explain and help with the strats. The only *real* question is whether you guys got him to transfer and join just to find out some strats or just figured out that he was your best source of strats available to you after the fact.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I’m not even really sure what you are trying to say. I would love to see some examples of me or other leaders claiming to be l337. If you’re referring to the most recent post, that strat bit was a direct pot shot at all this bullshit you and yours have been spewing. If you didn’t catch that, then I guess I overestimated your intelligence.<br>
<br>
Now to address your issues with Loko, I think I should set the record straight. Truthfully, all your hate should be directed at me. I have friends on a few servers, all of which have progressed as far as you. Yes, I use them to bounce ideas off of. Yes, they give me the basic dynamics of encounters. I would be “shocked and awed” to find out you don’t do the same thing. The difference is, Tindi`Losi doesn’t have anywhere near what any of those guilds have in the way of gear, hard core member strength or AA. So what does that mean? It means we have to change strats to make it work for us. <br>
<br>
Loko has been, is now, and always will be a valued member of Tindi`Losi. Yes it’s true, he no longer plays full time for Tindi. But after having the tenacity to wake up at 2am every morning for over 2 years just to raid with us, could we blame him for wanting to move to a server on his own time zone? Loko plays with us when he can, on top of raiding full time with his guild. And he plays my cleric every time. As far as I am concerned, he is a part time officer.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Funny thing is... now that it is out... every time you do something, someone will always wonder if Mortalis gave you the strat or did you do it on your own. No one will ever be able to know because of this hilarious stuff. And... what is really funny is that every time you post anything, you know what folks will be thinking about what you post.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are assuming we care. We aren’t out to prove anything. Unlike you, we aren’t interested in trying to inflate our virtual penis in order to compensate for a 3 inch one in real life. We have never claimed to be better than anyone. We play this game to have fun, and have the occasional server first. We know our member base isn’t made up of 100% of hard core gamers, so we advance proportional to it. <br>
<br>
In response to that last quote, what I think is really funny, is how your leadership went to Loko’s guild leader to bitch about this whole incident and was basically told to pound salt. Especially when it was me who provided the basics of the fight. Sure Loko filled in a few gaps, but you have the source mixed up. Hell you didn’t even know I actually fought Fennin on another server just 2 weeks ago. I especially liked the post on your private boards claiming we stole your strat specifically.<br>
<br>
It’s too bad that my posting here was exactly what you wanted. But I, like many of my guildmates, could not sit idle while you took a half assed pot shot at us. I just whish I could get the small chunk of my life back I spent while typing this response to your flame.<br>

Second: stop trying to put Tindi's members down for being guided through encounters that are new to them, only a few guilds actually attempt anything first, everyone else down to the smallest guilds that don't even have actual raids get their information and strategies from others, there isn't any reason to have to learn the mobs themselves and find out what works other then the sense of accomplishment that not everyone cares about.<br>
Third: Tindi should have expressed thanks to Mortalis for allowing Loko to log onto a Tindi's toon as he risks being banned for using someone else's account and they can also expect any guilds on their server to suddenly look at their strats and with a few tweaks and some O_o l337 strat given to them be killing mobs they are incapable of handling themselves.<br>

Its funny how we have this whole thread about &quot;using&quot; another guild for a strategy, yet we are saying that teaming up on non rotation mobs is disallowed. Basically you just killed all arguments we can make considering teaming as getting strats like that is another form of teaming in my eyes. <br>

You seem to think Gromm is just meaning that you got your strat on just FR. How about RZ, the avatars in air, the named in fire?

You are correct in the fact about Gromm's intelligence Kapen. He's extremely intelligent and you were probably right in your assessment of him goading all the remarks he got. I am sure there will be many more coming in the next few weeks. <br>

Personally I give two shits about  loot etc etc etc I care about beating the content. I like that feeling that I got when I could finally kill that flipping orc pawn that beat the shit out of me every time I went after a wasp. That's what I play this game for. I play this game so damn much that all that is left is the END game as we so fondly know it. To be honest, I wouldn't be able to be a part of a guild that was being spoon fed strat to the point of knowing EXACTLY what to do before I even saw the mobs I would be fighting....What's the point? Where's the satisfaction? Another 100 hpnts is not going to do shit for me if I didn't EARN it. If I found myself in a guild that was doing this sort of thing I would instantly guildremove and go on my way, because that has nothing to do with the game I play. Why am I so pissed off?

There is no need to thank Mortalis, Loko did not take time away from his guilds raiding to come raid with us. Loko uses his own personal time to do so. The only person who risks anything is me, since it is my cleric. I will restate again. Loko always has been, is now and always will be a member of Tindi`Losi.<br>
<br>
The O_o l337 strat was not given to us. It was something I personally added (actually it was Rejard’s original idea). Which in all honesty was quite trivial, and something we use on a lot of other mobs. As I stated in the above reply, that line was a specific pot shot at the BS being spewed by a few BotS members. It sure did get a lot of peoples panties in a bunch didn’t it?<br>
<br>
As for the incapable of handling themselves, I will address both you and Trivilus at the same time. There is quite a big difference between knowing a strat and actually executing it. You still need to have the right classes, enough DPS, a base of equipment giving you HP and resist. Not to mention the experience in these types of encounters (as many in PoP are very similar) to not screw up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Its funny how we have this whole thread about &quot;using&quot; another guild for a strategy, yet we are saying that teaming up on non rotation mobs is disallowed.

<br>
Yes, that’s your opinion. But it doesn’t kill all arguments. Teaming up is forming an alliance of manpower. For every PoP encounter, you need to have a bare minimum of people to be successful. It’s a matter DPS vs. healing power (duh right? Isn’t every encounter about that?). Hell some fights the strategy is everyone nuke including clerics, and make the mob die before your guild. Strat or not, if you don’t have enough people, you aren’t going to kill it. Also on the flip side, with an abundance of people many mobs can just be zerged down with no real strategy at all. Essentially what I am saying is, every guild, barring a select few doing the first few kills of mobs goes in completely blind. To make sure I am clear, I am saying even BotS goes into encounters with basic dynamics. Just as you have access to infoz in our guild, we have the same access to yours. The only difference as I see it, is we have never denied it, where you keep conveniently dancing around the subject.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You seem to think Gromm is just meaning that you got your strat on just FR. How about RZ, the avatars in air, the named in fire? Its kinda amazing that you all won all those encounters barring RZ on your first attempt?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, you should get your facts straight. We failed on the 2nd Avatar on our first try. It took us 3 clearings to get all the named in Fire. We lost to Ghirlorn(sp), Krizek and Offassaa each on our first attempts in Water. Should I go further? Grumus, I cant even count how many times we lost. Terris Thule, more than I can remember. AD, I remember wiping 6 times in one night, and we went at least 4 days before the big W. All 3 HoH trials, yup lost to all of these several times before we got it right, RD wiped us at least 4 times. Behomoth, 5 times it took us there. Mith Marr? Sure it took us 5 tries and 2 days, but we got it. Bertoxx, died on our second try. The Croc in PoE, 3 tries and still have yet to kill it. <br>
<br>
So lets take a look at what we have killed on our first try. Agnarr, Saryrn and the 4th Avatar. Anything else we did on the first try like 1st and 3rd Avatars etc., I think you would agree just about anyone who can get into the planes could do on their first try. Keep in mind, we did take like 6 attempts on Fennin with messed up agro the first attempt. But that doesn’t mean we didn’t learn most of what we needed to know. Wow when you look at it that way, it doesn’t quite add up the way you earlier painted the picture does it? <br>

The one thing I love about flames, are the embedded invisible ones. I mean really, if you’re going to flame, at least have the balls to go all the way. Don’t toss one out there and leave it all half assed so only the people in Tindi and BotS know what you are talking about. And as I see it, the only people who have any “clam” at all on the RZ subject is you. Anyways, this is getting good now. Keep the flames coming.<br>

You are killing a blowable mob that has been killed on numerous servers previously.  You have two options to pick from:<br>
<br>
A)  Research the encounter, and get a rough strategy idea, then attempt to impliment it and modify as needed.<br>
<br>
B)  Ignore all of the posted data about this encounter, and attempt it on your own, thus easily risking blowing a spawn, and wasting alot more time than needed.<br>
<br>
Now, please, tell me which you think is the smart solution; getting the mob dead, or wasting the spawn and everyones time?<br>

<br>
The thing is, BoTS has used Tindi's pride against the guild before.<br>
<br>
Last August, Rampage and AE's were broken due to a patch.  This made Emp of Ssra a much easier encounter.  Tindi was up for Blood, and our 4th shot at emp after blood.  The results of the discussion was that neither guild would touch blood/emp, and rumors were flying of emp b eing gm-killed on other servers.  Well, BoTS then moved up and took out blood/emp, saying that it was ok for them to kill the gimped out emp because they had done so in the past.<br>
<br>
Now, Gromm is attacking Tindi through the same mechanism, pride.  And I see no reason for someone to do something that is obviously the less intelligent choice simply because they are prideful.<br>

<br>
Yes, our strat for that mob was completely our own and we worked for 3 days I belive it was to get it just right.  We figured out the basic strat on the first day, but it took a lot of tries and a little luck to execute it just right.  That was a lot of fun, hard work, and late nights.<br>
<br>
One thing not mentioned here is that on the first day of that 3 day raid Adarien (a BotS cleric) attended the raid with us.  We invited him along because he was bored that day and asked to join us.  He watched us develop the entire strat and nearly execute it (we got Acrh Lich to about 2% that night).<br>
<br>
Soon after we beat Arch Lich BotS beat him too, with Adarien at the raid.  Wonder where they got the strat..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ootampa>Ootampa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your clever attempt to <br>

Leet Strat (OMG HERE IS TEH SPOILER): send a monk. Get hit. Record max hit. Record rampage occurance. Check AE against Lucy Database. OMFG LEET! (Note: REALLY leet players send a warrior. Do you gots balls? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Or just hardheaded RL's that sneeze and pull gods by mistake! *bwahah*) *Disclaimer: This strat works on most bosses up to and including POP<br>
<br>
Leet Strat #2: Argue constantly with your raid leaders into letting you melee Omnifiend. Success! Woah, he drops a lot faster when you melee! Argue constantly with your raid leaders into letting you melee Fennin Ro. OMFG I MELEED FENNIN AND DIDN'T GET HIT AT ALL! WOW!! OMFG I R TEH LEET SHIT DAWG!!! Damn those mobs are gimp. Who gives a fuck how they died? It took what, a day to learn pulling fire? A day to learn pulling water? Air might have taken a day or two longer without &quot;omfg leet outside knowledge&quot; (um, really, who gives a fuck, again?) You realize the Fennin Ro script is six fucking hours long? People would have to be RETARTED to be able to spawn it and not learn it in the same session.<br>
<br>
I'm new to Tindi and I'll be the first to say half the guild has more pride than it knows what to do with (Example: this here thread!) BUT FFS how hard is Everquest? Where are the random encounters and thinking AI? Right, it's not hard, it's seamlessly predictable (well, AE charm is sorta teh suck). The challenge lies in making people work together smoothly, not figuring out leet strats to beat mobs. That's what created the CH chain way the fuck back in the day. &quot;OMFG if you guys all CH me every 2 seconds in a perfect chain I'll never die! unless he flurries, hmm....&quot;<br>
<br>
Really, I think Tindi's over-reacting to this (who gives a fuck what they think, guys, really? Mob learned, move on), and I think BOTS is giving EQ far too much credit if they think there's a high level of challenge* involved in the encounters in this game. The challenge is making the people work flawlessly enough to overcome it. (And that is a challenge!)<br>

*(Yah, I am aware The Rathe is fuxored, but give the Dev Team a few months to pull an expansion outta their ass and then we can fight the nerfed version. Yah, I am aware that Coiri is a DPS fight. Where's the challenge? Get enough DPS, tell it what to do, sit back and pwn!)<br>
<br>
Seriously guys ..... OMFG EVERQUEST IS TEH HARD!!!!!<br>
