SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">How to do Fear</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">*EDIT*<br>
A few things, this is ONE way to do fear, there are many ways to do it.  The inportant part about this insertion methods are GETTING A CLERIC TO THE SS and MAKE SURE YOU DIE AT LEAST NEAR THE FIRE WALL ALONG THE PATH.<br>
<br>
If on the path you can be easily CRed by a decent monk.  If you make it to the fire wall nearly any one can get you, the main problem with this path is scarabs see though invis, but having a monk look out for them and giving the cleric time to get bound at the SS assures you will be off to a good start.<br>
*End Edit*<br>
Insertion:<br>
<br>
The best insertion is No Insertion, IE Run in and camp out at the SS the night before while plane is cleared or despawned. Whenever you have a chance to do this, do it.<br>
<br>
*EDIT*<br>
Talk to the guild that is doing the plane the day before you, they will generaly let you know when they have cleared the portal and will let you run your people in to camp at the SS for the next day.<br>
*End edit*<br>
<br>
If this isn't possible, you have to do it the hard way. Here's the Insertion path:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.everquester.com/graphics/maps/fearsnag2.jpg">www.everquester.com/graph...rsnag2.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
What you want to do is gather your people at the portal beforehand En Masse. If someone is camping Cyndreela, great, leave it to them (Don't KS!) If not, just wack her when she spawns. The first person to go in should be a naked cleric with some copper. 99% of the time this will be Zachton :P Zach will bind at the portal, then lose a duel and respawn naked. Someone will hand him a copper, then he will mem bind affinity<br>
<br>
*EDIT*<br>
I was just niffty that way, to be honest I never did the rez out of the plane thing, I just ran in fully clothed.<br>
*End edit*<br>
<br>
At this point, cleric should be buffed up with MR, all hp buffs possible, lev/DMF, SoW or Scale of Wolf, and invis/camo. We will send our monk/sk/necro in to FD at portal. When FDer reports portal is clear, cleric will run in and haul ass along the insertion path to the SS and will immediately bind themselves. If they are caught and slaughtered before they reach the SS, they will respawn at portal to try again. Upon reaching the SS, one of 2 thinks can happen - either someone can rez/revive the corpse outside, or, if the cleric has mobs beating on them, they can /q. That way if they die, it will only be once and they will have a rezzable corpse at SS. If corpse becomes too old for rez while cleric is stuck inside Fear, a druid can run in and bind, then port cleric out to retrieve the clothed corpse later in the raid. But the important part, establishing a permanent cleric at the SS, is taken care of.<br>
<br>
Next, the actual insertions should begin. A second FDer at the SS is helpful here. People should run in either solo or in groups of two or three with the following buffs - AC/HP buffs, lev/DMF, Sow/Scale, RM, and invis/camo. They should zone in when the FDer(s) say the portal (or both portal and SS) are clear and run along the insertion path thru the tentacle terrors (which do not see invis) along the firewall and up to the SS. If they get a mob on them they should die just south of the SS, on top of the little hill you run over. This is to avoid training any people who have successfully made it to SS and are in the process of camping. IMPORTANT - do NOT die south of the firewall or by the portal. If you do, you will NOT be CR'd until that area of the plane is cleared. If you make it in and camp out safely at the SS, log on an alt and wait for the allclear. If you die, stay on as your main and wait for rez.<br>
<br>
Once everyone is in and safely dead/camped, we will begin dragging and rezzing the bodies of the slain. Again, corpses that cannot be easily reached will NOT be CR'ed. After the rezzing is all done, we will buff up and proceed to clear the zone in a counter-clockwise motion, starting with the scarelings, shiverbacks, and spinechillers in the NW corner. We will attempt to clear the northwest corner as fast as possible so as to move out of the SS before mobs path into it - cause they will <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  As the plane is cleared, the camp will move several times to the following spots - SS, NW corner, West wall (this one may not be always used), FF house, Bowl (south of portal) WW/Sam Tower (Gray stone tower east of Bowl), Frightfinger house, and then back to the Yellow Tower to pull the temple. I will outline each part of the raid.<br>
<br>
Basics of the pulling phase -<br>
<br>
Depending upon how many people, how many enchanters, and whether or not an FD puller is available, pulls may be fast or slow. Please do not complain if you feel the pulls are going an inappropriate speed - even a modest CR takes longer than 3 pulls. Usually a pull will work as follows - the monk goes out and gets hit by 1-10 mobs. He will then run out to a predetermined spot a good ways out of camp and FD. The picker will be standing about halfway between the FDer and the camp and will pick (shoot straggling mobs) off the FDer. This is used to separate large packs of mobs. If the pull contains a scareling, 99% of the time the mobs will ALL come, because scarelings can aggro on the camp all the way from the pick spot. The picker will run back to camp with the pull, at which point everyone should /assist the main assister (Usually Me, Arafein). Once all the mobs are dead, the next pull will be made as mana permits. Sometimes the monk will get too much aggro on him and be forced to /q to clear the aggro lists.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the FDer will be busy or LD and the picker will be able to make a pull. DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS YOURSELF. DO NOT LEAVE CAMP FOR ANY REASON. If you are not in the pull group, you should NEVER EVER leave the camp. The reason why is that aggro ranges in fear are HUGE - 90% of mobs can aggro from VISUAL range. For a non-FDer to make a successful pick, he must be able to isolate pixel-sized mobs in his view and judge pathing of possible invisible wanderers. If the picker gets more mobs than the camp can handle, he should DIE outside of camp. It may be possible for someone else to pick off his corpse, or the pull can be aborted and the picker rezzed to try again.<br>
<br>
If Cazic Thule is up, the zone will become 900% more difficult. The reason why is this - Cazic's aggro range is monumental - he can DT you from the NE corner while you are sitting at the SS. DT is a 'Deathtouch', an instant death to the PC of his choice. It usually looks like this....<br>
<br>
(Arafein walks over a hill. Cazic Thule sees Arafein)<br>
Cazic Thule says, 'ARAFEIN!'<br>
Cazic Thule shouts, 'Denizens of Fear, your master commands you to come forth to my aid!'<br>
Arafein has been slain by Cazic Thule!<br>
<br>
No damage, no nothing - DT is an instant 20k of dmg to the target and is nearly impossible to resist. It recycles every 30 seconds. When Cazic has DT'd someone, many of the mobs in the plane will converge on that person's last known location - usually their corpse. Not all the mobs will do this - mostly only the ones that can speak, IE thought bleeders, glare lords, Amygdalas, etc. The most visible side effect of this is the 15 or so Amy Knights in the temple running out and HT'ing the unlucky bastard's corpse several times. This means you do NOT want to be near the area. If the person who got the DT got it in camp, everyone should camp out to an alt and wait for the FD'er's all clear. If not, everyone should stay far, far away from the spot of his/her death until all the mobs have gone home.<br>
<br>
DT can happen for any one of several reasons -<br>
<br>
A - Cazic Thule sees you.<br>
B - Cazic Thule is informed of aggro (IE a mob that is aggro on you runs to the NE area of the zone. This is very easy to let happen. Also, if a pet is near the camp and its master is not, or vice versa, there's a good chance one of those two is running back to CT to tattle on you. Also, if you touch the firewall or any mobs near the firewall while Cazic is anywhere near any other part of the firewall, there's a good chance you'll become very famous.)<br>
C - You hit one of Cazic Thule's immediate family. This consists of 4 mobs - Fright, Dread, Terror, and Dracoliche. The instant anyone hits any of these mobs, CT will Zap them. The mob will then try to run to CT to tattle on the rest of the camp. It's important to kill these mobs instantly - do NOT let them get away or you will have to pull them again, which means still more DT'ing.<br>
<br>
DT's are sometimes isoloated, sometimes not - IE sometimes Cazic will chill out after DTing one person, and other times he will DT until everyone has camped. The best way to be sure whether you need to camp is to wait 30 seconds after the first DT - if he zaps a second person, it's time to camp. How he chooses who he DT's has to do with chain aggro - in other words, it's bad to be a bard in fearplane.<br>
<br>
Now, the specific areas of pulling.<br>
<br>
First, here's a description of each of the types of mobs. Just about every mob in fear has about 8,000 to 11,000 hit points, varying MR, and hits for about 120-140 points of damage at 10 delay. This means an unslowed fear mob will do 300 damage a second. Do not underestimate their melee.<br>
<br>
Scarelings - The single most hated mob in fear, with the possible exception of glare lords. These look like little fire imps and can backstab for 400ish. They fly at SoW speed, and can aggro from a quarter of the zone away. During the fight, they have the ability to randomly teleport you anywhere from 5 feet to 100 feet away in a random direction - this is very bad. If you get teleported while fighting, INSTANTLY type /loc and look around to get your visual bearings. Wait a moment or two to see if anything aggros on you. If not, run back to the camp to continue the fight. If something does hit you, DIE. We will CR you after the pull. Scarelings drop the rogue only rapier, Eyerazzia. They are also difficult to mez, so they should be a priority target in a multi-mob pull.<br>
<br>
Shiverbacks - Big apes. Decent aggro range and have a stun spell called ShiverbackStun. These are easily mezzed and drop the Monk-Only Shiverback-Hide armor.<br>
<br>
Spinechiller Spiders - look like big wooly spiders. They have a DoT they proc called spine chill which is pretty wimpy - only does abot 100 points of damage. These drop Cryosilk Armor, which is for pure casters. The Cryosilk Robe, however, no longer drops.<br>
<br>
Fetid Fiend, male - These look like giant zombies. They run slow and are easily kited. They proc strong disease on you (my favorite buff!) and drop Valorium Armor, for Paladins.<br>
<br>
Fetid Fiend, female - These look like big festering hags. Identical to male FF's, but they drop the Cleric-Only girdle of the Diligent.<br>
<br>
Worry Wraiths - These look like giant willowisps. They are enchanters and have pets, which can easily make a train if not watched closely. They cast Gflux, Anarchy, Sanity warp, and Mezmerize, as well as lots of other nasty enchanter spells. They drop no loot to speak of except an enchanter-only wand. This is one of the mobs that can fear, which means MR is a must before pulling them to camp, and everyone should turn off Run and SoW before fighting them. They are also difficult to mez, so they should be a priority target in a multi-mob pull.<br>
<br>
Tentacle Tormentors - Giant Tentacle Terrors. They lifetap, knockback, and AE dispell - very irritating. They drop Ranger-Only Thorny Vine armor. Affectionately known as 'Buff Killers'<br>
<br>
Turmoil Toads - Tiny undead frogloks. They hop very fast and cast the Panic spell, which is a very nasty Fear. They are extremely hard to mez, so they are a priority target. These drop the Shaman-only Flayed Turmoilskin Belt, and Turmoil warts, a decent throwing weapon.<br>
<br>
Samhains - Giant scarecrows. These cast the Scarecrowstun spell, but that's about it. They run slow, too. Drops the Ranger-only Fluxbladed Axe. The axe IS visible when a samhain has it, and it WILL proc on you.<br>
<br>
Gorgons - Giant flying Medusa Harpies. They proc an EXTREMELY nasty stun which lasts for several seconds, so they are very hard to pull without getting stunned and ripped apart. They drop Druid-only Vermiculated Armor.<br>
<br>
Boogeymen - Giant Ghouls. They drop Necromancer-only Blighted Armor.<br>
<br>
Glare Lords - The other candidate for most hated mob in fear. They look like tiny Evil Eyes and have pets, which allows them to cause huge trains quite easily. They dispell, cast AE and DD spells that hurt very badly, and Drain mana. When fighting multiple glare lords at once, be careful, because the AE dispell they can cast will break mezzes. They drop nothing of value except a magician-only wand. They can also fear AND panic, so be prepared.<br>
<br>
Frightfingers - Tiny little reanimated hands. They don't hit very hard compared to other mobs, but they DO cast nasty wizard spells. They drop Wizard-Only carmine armor.<br>
<br>
Amygdalan Warriors - These look like....well, they look pretty unique. Picture a big weird-looking hercules type dude with an Octopus for a head. If you know what an Illithid or Mind Flayer is, that's what they look like. They are Warrior mobs, which means they have high defensive skills, high MR (Difficult to mez - priority target) and hit pretty hard. They also have the effect of Mana Sink every time they hit you, just like Quag Maelstrom in OOT. They Drop the Warrior-Only Nautilus Shield and the Warrior-Only Amygdalan Tendril.<br>
<br>
Amygdalan Knights - Look like Amy Warriors, but have pets, cast SK spells, and can HT your ass for a very large amount of damage. These drop Shadowknight-only Umbral Armor. Like Amy warriors, these cast Mana Sink with every hit, and they are also able to fear.<br>
<br>
Nightmares - big evil horses. These blind, panic, and fear. Be prepared. They drop nothing of value except a Nightmare Hide, a 5 ac cloak with 5 charges of Cure Blindness.<br>
<br>
Phoboplasms - Giant Gelatinous cubes. They dispell you with every hit, and run VERY slow. They can drop specific pieces of many armor sets - Indicolite Guantlets, Woven Shadow Bracers, Imbrued Platemail bracers, etc.....list is too long to list here - One piece of varying armor sets.<br>
<br>
Fright, Terror, and Dread - These are all the same mob, with different names and textures. They look like gigantic Mud, Rock, and Steel golems, cast EarthElementalAttack (root) while chasing you, and cast Ghoulroot when they hit you. Otherwise, easy mob, easy to mez, drops nothing. Be forewarned, the first person to hit, mez, or cast on them will INSTANTLY be DT'd if Cazic is up, so it's usually a good idea to have some ranger or something hit them when they first come into camp to take the DT, then have the enchanter mez. The enchanter will be almost guaranteed to get the second DT, but hey, they live 30 seconds longer to be useful. Each Golem is guarded by 2 Amy Knights. The puller should run within aggro range of the Knights, get HT'd, then proceed to run all three mobs around in the SE corner of the zone. The picker will attempt to pick the 2 Amy's off the puller as he runs around kiting. At NO TIME should EITHER the picker or puller hit the golem - they will get zapped, and the golem will run off to tattle on CT. The picker should shoot the amys with an arrow or spell. If the golem aggros on the picker, he should trade places with the puller and kite the mobs around the SE corner, while the puller attempts to pick the amys off the picker. They will trade off until one of them has the amys and one has the golem. You may have to take the amys back to camp one at a time. The person with the amys should run back to camp with them and let camp kill them, then once the amys are dead, the person with the golem should run him into camp. Be careful not to lose the mobs - they will run to Cazic and tattle. Once the golem is dead, everyone should camp and come back. If CT is not up, these mobs can be pulled normally.<br>
<br>
Dracoliche - A big bone dragon. He complicates the zone a lot, mainly by being in the way for a lot of your pulls. This especially makes pulling the GY difficult. What will usually happen is the puller will attempt to pull around Draco as much as possible until most of the West and South areas of the zone are clear, then they will pull him to the SW area. It is important that the party get Draco solo - you don't want him to bring friends. He is basically an undead Dragon that hits for 205-220, has a very nasty AE fear, and an AE DoT that is VERY deadly and is poison/disease based. DMF helps with this fight. He drops The Bone Clasped Girdle, The Warrior/Ranger Spined Dragon Claw, the Rogue-Only Bone Razor Dagger, and the Warrior-Only Monsoon sword. The Warriors on the Raid should roll BEFORE draco has been pulled, because once he is killed everyone should loot and camp IMMEDIATELY - Cazic will be DTing like mad and you will have lots of mobs bearing down on you. A major undertaking.<br>
<br>
Lastly, Cazic Thule himself, the God of Fear. He looks like a Giant Avatar of Fear, hits for 355-400, and has both Deathtouch (recycles every thirty seconds) and Harm Touch (only the first person to charge him takes this). He also casts Gravity Flux. To fight him, kill everything in the zone First. Then buff EVERYONE up with 4 junk buffs, followed by full buffs and Lev/DMF (VERY IMPORTANT). Cazic's AE Gravity Flux will do negligible damage with Lev on, but will dispell your first buff every time he casts it. If you have Jboots, hit them after every Gflux. Cazic's main vulnerabilty is Stuns - he stands there and does not attack while stunned. However, to cast on Cazic, you MUST stand DIRECTLY underneath him, which is very dangerous since he can HIT you there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He also has about 6-9 irritating little skeleton pets, which can be AE'd to death or kited by a druid. These can be a major impediment as they interrupt your casting. When about to charge Cazic, it is customary to send in a volunteer, usually a druid, to take the first DT so that everyone else can charge. Cazic Drops several dozen items, among them the cleric mace Dawnfire, the Warrior sword Bloodfire, the SK/Warrior sword Soul Leech, The Druid Staff of the Earthcrafted, the Crimson Robe of Alendine for Casters, as well as lots of other items.<br>
<br>
Now, for Areas of pulling and mobs that are there:<br>
<br>
The first area you pull will be NW corner - these mobs are pulled to the SS. The mobs here are Shivers, scares, and spinechillers. Once this area is clear, everyone should move to NW corner and pull the west area, which will be more of the same mobs, plus some FFs from the FF house. Once THAT is clear, you can begin to pull the tents from the bridge near GY and the mobs from SW corner, which consist of FFs, toads, amy warriors, shivers, scares, and sams. Once SW and the tent bridge are clear, camp should move to the FF house, and pullers should pull the 2 towers and the boogeymen house, as well as any accessible parts of the GY that can be easily reached. After 2 towers, boog house, and southern part of GY are clear, party should move to the bowl south of the portal (little dell indention in the ground kinda thing) and pull the SE corner of the zone and the rest of the GY (boogeymen, FFs, sams, ww's, amy wars, and toads mostly), as well as the gorgons and the Frightfinger house, and then Draco if he is up. Once those areas are clear, everyone should move to the Gray tower (ww/sam tower) to pull the golems and the glare lord bridge, then everyone should move to the FF house to pull the Mares and Phobos. If Cazic is up, this part will be tricky because the mares and phobos will have to be pulled while he isn't looking, which is very difficult. The same problem applies to pulling the glare lord bridge (as if that wasn't hard enough). Lastly, everyone should move to the yellow tower near the portal to pull the temple.<br>
<br>
Pulling the Temple is difficult and requires very precise coordination. Here's how it works. Ideally, everyone will have jboots - important, because a glare lord is often inside the temple and can and will dispell everyone's SoW. First, if Cazic is up, someone needs to be watching him - you do not want him to be near the firewall when the cleric runs in, or he will get a fat DT.<br>
<br>
*EDIT*<br>
In my guild I'm the Cleric that gets to do this, though I have been training two other cleric's to do it in my absence, if any clerics need tips or a walk though of this give me or Darin a call to show you the path, I'm not sure who else usualy pulls temples for guilds but I do know that Darin and I can walk people though it.  Darin is a true bad ass, he can pull anything in this zone, he has every path and agro range memorized.<br>
*End Edit*<br>
<br>
A brave cleric will DA and run thru the firewall, run along the western wall of the temple (NOT over the top - that's a good way to get a DT) and get HT'd by many, many amys. The DA will absorb the HTs, and he/she will run out of the firewall towards the tent bridge, looking back to see how many are on him/her. If there are more than six, cleric will run under the tent bridge, which should get some of the amys stuck in a pathing bug which will cause them to disappear back into the temple for a short time. The cleric should run around and around the hill on which the portal is seated, and the picker should attempt to pick a few amys off him/her. If picker gets more than 4 amys, he/she should run them under the bridge to split them up. if he/she STILL has too many, he/she should kite them around the NW area while the puller attempts to pick off him/her or the cleric. Be careful while kiting, because the Amy knights can cast clinging darkness, which will slow you up and get you wacked. Eventually, SOMEONE will get 1 or 2 amys on them. These can be brought back to camp to be slain, then the process will repeat. Once all the amys being kited have been slain, cleric should DA again again and run up to the firewall, then around to the north and out by the west side of the SS. When he does this, some of the mobs that got peeled off on the bridge will teleport on top of him/her. He/she will kite these around the portal and picker and puller will repeat the earlier process until all the mobs in the temple have been slain. Once this is done, the entire zone will be clear, unless CT is up. If CT is up, everyone should will then run to the SS and buff up for him, then send the sacrificial druid in when he wanders to the NW area of the NE corner of the zone. After the druid gets the finger, charge CT and bring him down. Congratulations! You have cleared the Plane of Fear.<br>

<br>
FD pulling is not the best method to pull if Cazic is not up, and will certianly get everyone killed if he is.  <br>
<br>
When Cazic is up, a FD has a good chance of working, but often the hate list will propogate back to cazic from those that &quot;go home&quot;.  (The agro range on these things is extreme, most of the time if you can see it, it is already planning to kill you.)  When another creature enters this agro range, it gets a copy of the original's hate list.  That means that a successful FD will result with Cazic DT the puller in about 60 to 90 seconds.  An experenced puller can over come this quite easily by knowing how to pull, but the more inexperenced the puller - the more likely you will be doing a corpse recovery.<br>
<br>
The most common method to pulling is the pull and pick strategy.  This is where a tank with the highest magic resistances goes out and pulls one or more creatures.  (This tank is usually a hybrid - all 3 have specific talents that make this work well).  The strategy is to kite as few as possible in wide circles and allow another tank to pick one mob at a time.  With this strategy it is very possible to have some extremely bored enchanters in fear because you can pull almost the entire zone one mob at a time.  (Having 2 pickers and 2 pullers will REALLY speed up the rate in which you kill mobs... often faster than your casters can keep up.)  A mage with Call of Hero is extremely useful in this strategy.  If cazic is up it is important to not loose any of the mobs - which can happen due to horrible pathing in the graveyard.<br>
<br>
Another much more ambitious strategy is to divide your group into 2 or more sub groups.  This allows 2 creatures to be killed simultanously.  It is even possible to subdivide until you get to each group killing one mob, but usually pullers cannot bring them in that fast.  This isnt a good idea until you know the zone well.<br>
<br>
As a general rule, listen to the person in chanrge of the raid.  Don't camp until he or she tells you to but when he does don't wait to make sure others do as well.  Tanks should defend the clerics as they camp.  The only bad deaths in the planes are those of the clerics and enchanters.  If the enchanters are not alive then you will be camping and if the clerics are dead then so is everyone else. <br>
<br>
Don't argue about loot.  At the beginning of the raid the rules of looting should be established.  The don't change no matter how much someone wants a rare item.  The planes are about getting loot, but if that all you think about you will hate them.<br>
<br>
Don't wander away, and always use /assist.  Pet owners must keep an eye on their pets at all times, as many an enchanter will die from a pet doing its own thing.  A dead enchanter means a dead group.<br>
<br>
The Rathe has a system for you to ask for help if you cannot clear the plane if a god is up.  There is a predetermined guild that will help you out; and they promise to not take anything except for a rare epic component for their quests.  These quests require tasks much harder than the plane of Fear so please don't feel like anything is being taken from you - its not, you are giving them the item in return for them helping you gain all the rare god items that you group will get to keep.<br>
<br>
Finally, remember this if nothing else - the planes might be hard but they also can be extremly fun.  Pay attention to the group leaders and do not be afraid to ask others how they did it - the Rathe community will be happy to help.</font><P>Elaundar Nobillium
