You, from your comments here dont seem much better and look like a great representation of the ignorance we've come to expect from an SS member.

<br>
Then again didn't you post right in your first paragraph that you can't play often or at all? So why should you be interested in embroiling yourself in other people's buisness when it's none of yours? Do you have a stake in planes or ever been there to understand what we're talking about? probably not. Do you miss out the chance at getting your epic cause someone stole the mob? Not likely. And do you believe that SS is ACTUALLY in the right when the other 99% of the server believes they are wrong? probably. What delusions of grandure *sigh* Unfortunately that is the attitude (or seems to be) of all the SS members I've met so far. <br>
<br>
Here's a thought for you - <br>
<br>
Q: why did they decide to go FFA on Karana server?<br>
<br>
*jeopardy theme song interlude*<br>
<br>
A: Because if they moved servers they would get munched for lunch by the ubers elsewhere!<br>
<br>
Interesting food for thought eh? Since they KNOW they can't compete on a different server, they decide to stick it out here where every other guild has an agreement with eachother not to step on feet.<br>
*It's like a neigborhood where the big dogs promised not to beat eachother up and a chiuahuah decides to try and take over haha*<br>
Mairi, wake up and see what the rest of the server is saying. Until you see both sides your opinion is going to be solely yours and no one would be interested in hearing it.<br>

And yes, I have had to wait for my epic mob to become available, so I do know about that too. I have a planes capable toon (half way through the epic) on another server, and I have been there, so I do know whats at stake. And before you ask or make any snide comments, I left that server because I didn't like most of the people there. Not because of the way they do the large targets, not because of any reputation problems, or any other reason, only the one I stated. They were all greedy, lewt hungry jerks that I didn't care to be around. <br>
<br>
And this will concern me at some future time because although I don't have much time to play right now, I do expect to be able to play more in the near future; therefore it is my business.<br>
<br>
 I'm not going to go into whether or not I agree with the decisions SS has made, as that really is not the point of the last post I made(although you seem to think it may be...wake up and read my post, what it actually says, not what you want it to say), nor the point of this one. And I do take exception to your comment that I am not much better than them...which IS the point of this post. You do not know me, you have never met me, yet you are still ready to believe the worst of me just because I am a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> former</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> member of a guild you (and the rest of the server as well, lets be fair here)  have a problem with.<br>
<br>
I am not taking sides as to which way is the right way, or whether or not the KGC is a good thing or not. Right now, I really don't much care about any of that as it won't affect me for about 11 more levels. The WHOLE purpose of my posts is just to comment on the fact that you don't seem to have a forgiving bone in your whole body. I have read in several threads on several message boards where people have said &quot;We are condeming SS and all its members, if you want to be saved, leave that guild and all is forgiven&quot; and now what I'm getting from your posts is that you seem to be saying that is not the case, any former association with SS is going to condem me forever as well, even though I no longer belong to that guild and have not for some time. (And FYI, I do have a college level reading comprehension but my math skills suck.)<br>
  <br>
And I could say the same to you about your opinion, its yours, solely yours, and no one else is interested in hearing it. But it does give me the chance to indulge in one of my favorite pastimes, getting involved in a pointless discussion with a clueless (about me personally) person over the validity of anyones opinion. It may be pointless, but it IS entertaining. <p>Mairi<BR>

OK then how about we continue to boycott them and act like adults by doing just that?  For the record i have not and will not condemn anyone who is or was a member of SS, after all they are people just like i am.  However i will continue to disregard them as far as interaction within the game goes, because i do believe they are interrupting a system that was here long before them.  <br>
<br>
Mairi1, i apologize for any rudeness you have and may yet recieve.  The boycott is meant for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> members</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of SS, and i will not participate in any dispute with those that are not within their ranks.<br>

We have to be strong on this boycott or else it doesn't work and this does make it harder.<br>
You say that you left your previous server because people there were loot hungry jerks well I beleive you have come to the right place because the reason people are so pissed at SS is for exactly that reason. We all like to share and they don't seem ot want to.<br>

<br>
Folks, the whole point of this was to keep Shattering Steel from functioning as a guild.  If they need to disband and stay disbanded except for the occasional raid, we have accomplished that goal.  If they think they are fooling people, who cares, more power to them.  The point is, they cannot harm to rotational system to any degree.  It will take them 20-30 minutes to regroup, contact, and reguild enough people for a raid.  And those that keep an eye on them will notice that and step in at that point.<br>
<br>
As I said, so long as they dont have a SS tag I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  Should they choose to take advantage of that and screw others, then its on their karma.  Its the guild and their policies I and we have problems with.  The members are just people.  Some are good, some are bad, some are just misinformed, just as many here are.  Individually there's nothing wrong with most of them.  Its ONLY when they're together in a large raid that they become a threat.  So long as they're disbanded who cares.  Does anyone here actually believe that the members of SS are only in SS?  Let me disabuse you of that illusion.  Many of them have alts in other of your guilds.  Shall you do a witchhunt now?  Lets just deal with the guild and not care about who has what tag.<br>
<br>
As for someone being bumped off a raid, that's an internal matter within the guild/alliance.  The KGC does not say that everyone will make it to a raid or large target.  It just says that all the guilds/alliances that want to have a shot at them will.  Now if your guild or alliance doesnt want to let you in their own raids, I'd have to question why your in that guild.  There are many out there.  Now the, the CoG, which this is, dont confuse it with KGC, does try to take as many people as possible up.  But many guilds/alliances will limit the numbers to maximize loot, minimize risk, and make the raid run smoother.  I suggest finding a different guild that will take you for you rather than just whining.  Just because you belong to a large uber guild doesnt mean that you will get to do stuff with them or get the phat loot.  You need to make the opportunities yourself.  And if your guild or alliance doesnt give you those opportunities, its time to find one that can.<br>
