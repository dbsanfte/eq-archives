At the time you said you were sorry and would MQ them with the person who had won them. This was my raid, you asked me if you could join , I said yes as long as you followed my rules. I find it interesting that the only peice of armor you have of the Thurg Quest armor is the boots.<br>
Now i know you said that a freind of yours played your account that day. This i believe is a lie because i had asked you a few times what your friends name was  a little strange that you gave different names each time. Granted those may have all been his alts.<br>
Another thing i found interestering is that one day while you were in E.Commons talking to a guildie in say you said &quot; time for me to go she is still here&quot;<br>
Now are you going keep on lieing about this, or are you  going to admit to it.<br>
If you have any dought as to if you lost the roll on those boots you can ask anyone from the following 3 guilds that were at that raid, yes they all remember you and how you ninjaed those boots .<br>
Keepers Of Oak<br>
Emerald Fire<br>
The Dragon Dynasty <br>
I'll do my best to state who all was there now if you want to ask them individualy.<br>
Orocular, Karmina, Feriin, Rithi, Gulifax, Beejay, Gekarr, Ravenhort, Paith, there are about 10 other that also went to this raid but as for now i can not remember who they are.<br>
Incase you were wondering who really won the boots I did, and it was my raid so at the tiem I did not make a big deal about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujurrasicepoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 272<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/31/02 8:35:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=576.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thegeekhost.com/gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Seht (Blood of War)</span><hr size=1> Lamers in BoW?  <br>

Thought I'd add my testimony.<br>
<br>
I dunno anything about this situation, however, I have run into Seht before...and I can confirm and vouche that his friend really does play his account...CONSTANTLY...<br>
<br>
Now...thats not to shift blame. The character still committed the crime, and if this loser chooses to share accounts, he shares responsibility, I can only hope (but definatly not expect) BoW to take action with this in mind.<br>
<br>
Seht applied to Fallen Shadows about 3 months ago. Upon contacting him in game, he had no clue what I was talking about and stated that his friend applied for the guild under his name, not him. Upon hearing that, I simply stated &quot;Tell your friend his application has been denied&quot; and that was the end of that.<br>
<br>
Anyhow...to be real honest...dont be too upset about the ninjalooting. Consider it this way, there are sneaky people who should be rooted out, and then theres BoW, which consists of people who root themselves out. Rathe has always been a server that holds reputation in highest regard...and if Seht, and the MANY MANY other BoW's that have reared thier ugly heads this month (most definatly attributed to the fact that they openly recruit in EC and pretty much the only requirements are that you have to be breathing) choose to beleive that bad reps fade, let them beleive that. Its THEM who will not be experiencing the things that we do every day. NOT us. <p><a href=http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Database/scripts/character-page.php?charid=5>Kluz</a><br><embed src="http://www.wyrmhole.org/fallenshadows/Flash/kluzsig.swf" quality=high pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="200" height="150"></embed><br><a href=http://www.fallenshadows.cjb.net>Fallen Shadows</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uroggulbuk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Slavedriver</span><br>  Posts: 545<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/1/02 6:12:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=576.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Seht (Blood of War)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

BoW is going through a MAJOR revamp right now due to a couple of our officers continuing to recruit folks after recruiting was closed.<br>

Seht is the brother of one of our founding members and good personal friend of mine.  I was not aware that someone other than the owner was using this account.  It is being handled among the officers as I type this.<br>

The fact remains that quite a few BoW members have acted up lately and I DO wish you the best in regaining some reputation amongst the server. <br>

I have, and Im sure most other people feel this way too, a good deal of respect for your general leadership for addressing each case here, calmly and openly, rather than the usual STFU you dont know what youre talking about.

Be fair. BoW has had problem after problem for a good straight month now at least....Perhaps the BoW charter dictates a goal much different than a few bad apples in the guild make it seem, however, when joining a guild, a members actions represent the guild, and the guild...well...its a repeat offender at this point.<br>

Im going to go with Hutterr on this one. I completely agree that your public address of these issues give a lot of us relief. And no, I was not trying to flame you, and I have stuck up for BoW before....admittedly (&lt;---dont ask me to spell that word), before the last 4 offences took place. But I've respected you, Ravienn, a lot longer than you've ever even heard of my name. Trust me...if you need assistance, I'd be the first person to say yes if asked.<br>

Good. Very good. Sometimes certain people use their brothers accounts to powerlevel their own alts, however, condoning two different people which make up the whole character is asking for trouble. It eludes me though that a personal friend of yours would keep secret that he shares his account with a maniac, yet openly admit it to me, a stranger. I've seen two different version of Seht. I've seen a calm, &quot;Apologetic for this characters actions&quot; Seht, and I've seen a raving maniac.<br>

<br>
Never have you wronged me, personally. Perhaps, being a guildfounder, guildleader, then having handed leadership to my brother, the aspects of what a guild means hits me harder than others, and repeat offences give wind that BoW condones monkey business. But again, I say that for each problem that has happened, you've shown your face, made apologies, and promised to handle the situation. Thats definatly respectable.<br>

I loathe cliche. especially this one, since everyone on the Flame board seems to think this is a hip 21st century lingo. My grandma says this. and anything my grandma says is strictly forbidden from the Flame Board.<br>

Anyhow, Rav, I wish you luck. Truly, and I meant it when I said I'd offer my assistance. Might I add that its even more respectable that you dont curl up and take the $hit we throw at BoW, but rather stand up against it.<br>

Seht is not the close personal friend, but his brother.  His brother and I have worked together for 3 years.  His family and mine spend a lot of time together.<br>

ROFL... you got me there.<br>
<br>
<br>
As it stands now, my friend was standing behind his brother at the time of the incident.  He tells me that Seht won the roll.  I would trust this guy with my life, in fact I do being in the military.  That is why I ask for logs.  This looks to be a he said, he said issue with no clear resolution.<br>
<br>
If you could send me proof or have those that were there send me an email or a tell in game it would help.  If I find that, you are correct, I personally will loot plate boots and MQ them with you.<br>

From the original post, it seems that Seht (or his brother... whatever) knew that he shouldnt have looted the boots. However, is it possible that he overlooked a higher role, looted the boots saw it afterwards and the brother standing behind him still missed it?<br>
<br>
This seems to be a VERY possible, if not likely occurance, and would alleviate the lying, and the reason that the real Seht turned in the boots later.<br>
<br>
I saw a post once aasking a question to the effect of &quot;Do evil people really think they are evil? or do they think they are good and the good people are evil?&quot; I seriously doubt that Fer is just lying about this, and I also doubt that the real Seht thinks he stole the boots. I DO think that Sehts bro could clear up a lot of this.<br>
<br>
This is the VERY reason that accounts shouldnt be shared, at least for fighting. I wont say whether or not anyone has access to my account, but I am willing to take responsibility for my character. <p>Hutterr Verbruggen

This is the same thing that I've been thinking.<br>
