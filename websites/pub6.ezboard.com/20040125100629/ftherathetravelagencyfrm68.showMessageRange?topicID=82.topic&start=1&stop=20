NATIONAL TELEVISION ADDRESS OF SEPTEMBER 7, 2003<br>
<br>
President Bush's illegal war and occupation of Iraq<br>
has left the Administration in a position of extreme<br>
political vulnerability. He now wants the United<br>
Nations and U.S. taxpayers to bail him out. Having<br>
defied U.S. and world public opinion - which<br>
preemptively opposed his planned, illegal invasion of<br>
Iraq - the Bush administration wants to<br>
internationalize responsibility for the U.S. quagmire<br>
in Iraq. With U.S. casualties mounting daily he wants<br>
the soldiers of other countries to do more of the<br>
dying to take the heat off himself at home. And in the<br>
name of fighting international terrorism he wants<br>
already suffering working class, poor and middle class<br>
communities to foot the bill to the tune of another<br>
$87 billion (triple what they had &quot;projected&quot;). Having<br>
had his public rationale(s) for the war been exposed<br>
in recent weeks as a complete fraud, Bush shamelessly<br>
reverts to the time-tested tactic of trying to scare<br>
the hell out of people.<br>
<br>
<br>
President Bush's conduct on Iraq - before, during and<br>
now after the Iraq war - has made the old cliché about<br>
truth being the &quot;first casualty in war;&quot; to be a grand<br>
understatement. Everything about this &quot;pre-emptive<br>
war&quot; is premised on deceit. Even in the realm of ever<br>
duplicitous &quot;world politics,&quot; the Administration's<br>
pattern of cynical deception was and remains<br>
breathtaking. Tonight's nationally televised address<br>
conforms to this pattern of endless deceit.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) Bush lied before the war. Iraq never posed a grave<br>
and imminent danger to the United States. Iraq had<br>
nothing to do with September 11th. Iraq never<br>
possessed nuclear weapons. Iraq was not rapidly trying<br>
to develop weapons of mass destruction. This was a war<br>
of aggression against the second-largest oil producer<br>
on the planet that had been weakened by a decade of<br>
economic sanctions and political isolation.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Bush lied during the war. This was not liberation.<br>
The Iraqi people did not welcome the U.S. armed forces<br>
as liberators but as occupiers. Their lives did not<br>
become better. On the contrary, this culturally rich<br>
society has been torn apart, deprived of necessary<br>
services to sustain civilian society and is on the brink<br>
of internal collapse.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) Bush is lying now. Iraq is not the battlefield<br>
between &quot;international terrorism&quot; and the forces of<br>
so-called &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;civilization.&quot; The growing<br>
resistance to U.S. occupation is the consequence of an<br>
angry and proud people in Iraq who insist on<br>
reclaiming their own sovereignty. Having killed tens<br>
of thousands of Iraqis in an illegal invasion - and<br>
responsible <br>
for a growing number of dead and maimed U.S. soldiers - the<br>
Bush team wants U.S. taxpayers to spend at least<br>
another $87 billion on the occupation of Iraq. The<br>
vast majority sentiment in Iraq wants the U.S.<br>
soldiers to leave and the U.S. GI's want to go home.<br>
The Iraqi people's call to end the occupation is not a<br>
call for even more foreign nations to occupy Iraq and to<br>
take a share in the looting of Iraq's natural<br>
resources. The truth is that the invasion and<br>
occupation of Iraq is viewed by the people of the<br>
Middle East as an act of &quot;international terrorism&quot; and<br>
as such it can only lead to a dangerous escalation in<br>
the cycle of violence.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why did Bush address the nation tonight? He, like<br>
Nixon a generation ago, fears that the people of the<br>
United States are turning against this criminal war.<br>
During his administration, Bush has only rarely felt<br>
that he must address the people, and does so when he<br>
fears that a sentiment is growing strong enough to<br>
challenge his illegal actions. He must then lie more<br>
to convince the people of the U.S. to support his<br>
criminal endeavors, or at least acquiesce in them. His<br>
shameful &quot;top gun&quot; act aboard the aircraft carrier the<br>
U.S.S. Lincoln, in front of a &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;<br>
banner, was an effort to tell people in the United<br>
States and around the world that the war was over and<br>
that no more critical attention need be focused on<br>
Iraq. Tonight, with that lie laid bare, he is seeking<br>
to go a new route, to convince people that far from<br>
being over, the war is a high stakes game to save<br>
&quot;civilization&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; and that it requires<br>
endless sacrifice in human life and vitally needed<br>
resources.<br>
<br>
VoteNoWar.org calls on people in the<br>
United States to join together for a massive<br>
demonstration in Washington DC on October 25th to<br>
demand &quot;Bring the Troops Home Now, End the Occupation<br>
of Iraq.&quot; Tens of thousands will be in the streets<br>
that day as the antiwar movement picks up new<br>
momentum. <br>

<br>
What propagadist told you the US ecomomy revolves around Arms production? The same one who failed to tell you that FRENCH MADE Arms were found all over Iraq?<br>
<br>
Do some research moron learn to think for yourself you have a PC obviously,go do a search for US GNP and Manufacturing see where our economy comes from (HINT: it is NOT from importing cheese,wine,crappy cars to a superpower)<br>
<br>
The US will fight only wars we can gain from? WOW!BRILLIANT!here all this time I thought a countries purpose in fighting a war was to HARM THEMSELVES!!!!!<br>
<br>

They did. From Canada to Korea, from france to Saudi Arabia they laughed. They threw parades and demonstrations. They took holidays and made merry because of 9/11. Don't presume to know who lost what on 9/11.<br>
<br>
I never laughed at the fact that so many people died because they didn't have the common sense to get into the shade or turn a fan on. Just pointed it out that us stupid, pea brained Americans don't die by the thousands when it gets bit warm outside (it was over 111 with 80% humidity for over 3 weeks here in Houston TX and we had 1 poor 90 year old lady die due to heat during that time).<br>

<br>
Don't get me wrong, I am far more supportive of the entirety of North America than the poster boy for english-as-a-second-language-class above is, and with that comes a respect for the history of America, and by no means do I want to start a Canada-is-better-no-America-is-better conversation here. <br>
<br>
Does the fact that the US of A has those within her borders that do not support the war not suggest that there would be people elsewhere that do not support the war?<br>
<br>
Frankly, and I don't mean this as a genocidal perspective, but the 'rich culture' of stoning your women to death and killing people who disagree with your rulership... is that really worth preserving? From clitorial amputation to torture of political dissidents, isn't that culturally rich area of the world just a *little* beyond the pale in terms of leadership and direction?<br>
<br>
But who am I to say what is right and what is wrong? <br>
<br>
Judge for yourselves. <br>
<br>
Then, when a big enough society of people who share a similar judgement about the standard of living for people, and how human beings should be treated finally come together and see areas of the world where the rule is horror and crimes against humanity, rather than the exception, maybe then those people will try to do something... can't wait for that day, can you? <br>
<br>
Look at it this way:<br>
<br>
The early examples of all civilizations are rooted in poverty, oppression, bigotry and hatred of the 'other'. Find me a society that didn't start out as warring, classist, sexist, poor and oppressed, go ahead. <br>
<br>
It isn't that Canada and America and most of Europe is *better* than other places, and that the populations are *better* than other people. It's just that those areas are *farther along* in the development of their tolerances, cultural identity and ability to co-exist. <br>
<br>
Are they perfect societies? Fuck no.<br>
<br>
But is it at least a more tolerant place? Generally yes. <br>
Is it at least a more peaceful place? Generally yes. <br>
<br>
The point is that, frankly, oppressed people historically have only taken the shit for so long. Even the peacenik Canada has a long history of bloodshed (though long ago) which must be at least partially credited for the progress she's had. <br>
<br>
So no, the *people* are not better or worse around the world, and to a degree, the societies themselves are not *better* around the world (ruling out the oppression and whatnot). But the ability to develop is indeed better in some areas of the world. If you don't have the worries about food, water, shelter and clothing, you can spend time thinking about making the day to day lives of your people better. If you don't have to worry about militant religions killing each other, you can start to think about schools and roads and business and agriculture. Would Iraq eventually have moved into a differant cultural realm? Maybe, maybe not. <br>
<br>
As for the &quot;HA HA, I'm not french, fooled you&quot; bullshit, how about you figure this one out for me:<br>
<br>
In a geographical region stretching from, say, England to Germany, down/over to Italy and then back to the Atlantic ocean, you have an area that would fit *at least twice* inside Canada. <br>
<br>
Tell me what province in Canada I'm from based on my posts here. <br>
<br>
GOOD FUCKING GUESS THAT A PERSON IS AMERICAN, ASSHOLE. Get over yourself. Why?<br>
<br>
Because I guess you're from Europe!<br>
<br>
Name the state, if you're going to be all high and mighty about picking the right country, you fucking dolt, and then you can challenge someone to 'guess what country I'm from'.<br>

<br>
At least if you're going to assault the U.S. (which is what you did as opposed to assaulting the administration), attack them for their economic policy or something current. <br>
<br>
Personally, I see those who supported the war as those in favor of removing terror and dictatorship, as well as the possibility of potentially dangerous weapons from falling into the wrong hands. I see the anti-war crowd as dumb dumbs who have been coached from youth to believe war is bad in all situations no matter what, and garble off what mommy and daddy taught them. These people support the proliferation of this &quot;evil&quot; because of A) the above listed reason or B) economic interests. Can you say hypocrites ? Incase you are slow, the Europeans line was that the war was about Oil and making money from it. Meanwhile the Europeans were concerned with their weapon's and technology contracts. SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN EUROPE.<br>
<br>
Can we blame Europeans? Not really, most of World War I and II were fought there, and I'm sure it leaves some stinging memories. <br>
<br>
Fact is though, I will not take advice from people who think SNAILS are food. Nor will I listen to those who so recently begged the U.S. to throw off their own dictatorial leaderships through violence. Furthermore, coming from the country that 60 years ago tried to take over the entire WORLD, I don't want to hear about imperialism. A country that is still trying to figure out democracy after communism failed is also not high on my list of get down on the ground and worship them. <br>
<br>
What I'm getting at here is, European rhetoric is filled with hypocracy, denial, and lust for power and money, and taking any cues from them in the area of global politics, would be like drinking piss so you'll live longer, it's completely absurd. <br>
<br>
Of course.. we needn't mention how France recently handled the Ivory Coast...

on the planet that had been weakened by a decade of<br>
economic sanctions and political isolation.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This was a country who's leader had said publicly he wanted the U.S. to be hurt.  He then refused to cooperate with U.N. inspectors who were checking on WMD's.  Why not cooperate if you have nothing to hide?<br>
<br>
The U.S. had no reason whatsoever to believe the man, and when he was given a chance to prove his side he refused to cooperate.  That alone was reason enough imo.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2) Bush lied during the war. This was not liberation.<br>
The Iraqi people did not welcome the U.S. armed forces<br>
as liberators but as occupiers. Their lives did not<br>
become better. On the contrary, this culturally rich<br>
society has been torn apart, deprived of necessary<br>
services to sustain civilian society and is on the brink<br>
of internal collapse.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Some did welcome the U.S.  Some didn't.  Blanket statements that noone there did are ridiculous.  Many Iraqi's joined in revolt in both wars.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>3) Bush is lying now. Iraq is not the battlefield<br>
between &quot;international terrorism&quot; and the forces of<br>
so-called &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;civilization.&quot; The growing<br>
resistance to U.S. occupation is the consequence of an<br>
angry and proud people in Iraq who insist on<br>
reclaiming their own sovereignty. Having killed tens<br>
of thousands of Iraqis in an illegal invasion - and<br>
responsible <br>
for a growing number of dead and maimed U.S. soldiers - the<br>
Bush team wants U.S. taxpayers to spend at least<br>
another $87 billion on the occupation of Iraq. The<br>
vast majority sentiment in Iraq wants the U.S.<br>
soldiers to leave and the U.S. GI's want to go home.<br>
The Iraqi people's call to end the occupation is not a<br>
call for even more foreign nations to occupy Iraq and to<br>
take a share in the looting of Iraq's natural<br>
resources. The truth is that the invasion and<br>
occupation of Iraq is viewed by the people of the<br>
Middle East as an act of &quot;international terrorism&quot; and<br>
as such it can only lead to a dangerous escalation in<br>
the cycle of violence.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I'm still waiting for you tell us how us leaving is going to help.  Who will be in charge and will that be an improvement?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why did Bush address the nation tonight? He, like<br>
Nixon a generation ago, fears that the people of the<br>
United States are turning against this criminal war.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Oooh, people hate Nixon so let's associate Bush with Nixon!  What were you saying about scare tactics earlier? and PR jobs?  Doing pretty good yourself here.<br>
