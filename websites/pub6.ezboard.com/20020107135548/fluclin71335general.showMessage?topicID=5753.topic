<br>
Vol. I - THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING:<br>
The story starts with the twentieth birthday-party for Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit who lives with his brother Sam in a mythical land called the Shire. Frodo owns a magic Ring which makes him invisible when he wears it, a gift from his cousin Bilbo who stole it from the hoard of a Dragon years ago. <br>
One day the old wizard Gandalf comes to the Shire, and he tells Frodo of an evil being named Sauron who wants to capture the Ring for himself. In ages long past Sauron stole the Ring from the Elves, to protect him from the Powers of Good; but the Ring was stolen from him by a creature named Gollum,and then stolen from Gollum by the Dragons, and then from the Dragons by Bilbo, who finally gives it freely to Frodo. &quot;Sauron has been searching for the Ring for years,&quot; Gandalf tells Frodo, &quot;and now he has sent his ally, the evil Witch-king, to the Shire to look for it.&quot; Frodo and Sam consult with their loyal friends Merry and Pipsqueak, and when the evil Witch-king appears with his nine servants the clever hobbits trick them into going into a mushroom-patch, disorienting the witches just long enough to escape the Shire. <br>
But the tone of the book rapidly becomes more serious as the Witch-king and his evil servants pursue the hobbits through the forest. Frodo discovers that the witches have destroyed the village of Bree, and the Witch-king uses a magic spell to burn down the home of their old friend Tom Bombadil. Frodo, horrified, wants to go back and fight the evil witches, but at a hill called Weathertop he meets a noble man named Aragorn who convinces him to go to the city of Rivendell. &quot;In Rivendell you will be safe from their magic,&quot; Aragorn tells him, &quot;for Elrond is a sensible man, and does not believe in it.&quot; With that Aragorn leads them rapidly to Rivendell, with the witches in hot pursuit. As they ford the last river between them and Rivendell the Witch-king casts a spell on the river-water, causing it to rise up and try to drown them; only Frodo's quick thinking can save them, and he uses the power of the Ring to make all the water evaporate into fog. The fog is so thick that the Witch-king and his servants become hopelessly lost, and our heroes make it to the safety of Rivendell. <br>
At Rivendell, Elrond holds a Council where the fate of the Ring is discussed. The only way to keep Sauron from recovering the Ring, they decide, is to throw it into the volcano of Mount Doom where it will be destroyed. During the Council Gandalf arrives late, saying that he had been held prisoner in the tower of Orthanc, the Wizards' Tower. Curiously, he refuses to describe how he escaped. &quot;But it is more important than ever that we destroy the Ring,&quot; Gandalf says, &quot;for now the other Wizards know of it, and seek it as well.&quot; He tells of how the dark wizard Saruman, once an ally of the forces of Good, has turned to evil and now controls Orthanc with an iron hand, and how the other Wizards are roaming the countryside seeking the Ring for themselves. They all agree to set out to destroy the Ring at once. <br>
Gandalf and Aragorn agree to go with the four Hobbits, as does Glorfindel, a descendant of the ancient ruler Ar-Pharazon, and Boromir, from the Royal House of Gondor; also joining them are an Elf and a Dwarf who don't really do much in the story but are there for comic relief. Together Gandalf and his nine companions - the &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, as they call themselves - set out for the dark land of Mordor. <br>
On the way, their path is repeatedly beset by evil forces. First they are attacked by evil Orcs in the woods; next they are driven into the dark forest of Lothlorien, where they are imprisoned by the beautiful but evil Queen Beruthiel. They make their escape when Beruthiel's good sister, Galadriel, frees them from their prison-cell and floats them down the river in barrels. After that they think it best to leave the woods and head to Moria, the secret city under the mountains; here, however, they face a terrifying setback when they are found by the evil wizard Radagast. Gandalf sacrifices his life to destroy Radagast the Balrog, and the others escape the mountains while the battle rages. At the end of the book, however, the Fellowship is destroyed from within; Glorfindel, lusting for power, tries to kill Frodo for the Ring. Aragorn stops Glorfindel by shooting him through the throat with a black arrow; Glorfindel dies, but not until he maliciously sets fire to the grasslands. In the resulting smoke and confusion the Fellowship of the Ring is hopelessly scattered.<br>

<br>
First off,the party is for Bilbo on his eleventy first(111) birthday.(did you see the cake with all the candles?)<br>
Bilbo is Frodos uncle.<br>
The fireworks rocked<br>
Sam is not Frodos brother,a friend or employee of some sort.<br>
Bilbo did not get the ring from a dragon but he stole it from a gnome named Gollum.<br>
Bilbo did not give the ring up freely,Gandolf had to bonk him on the head.<br>
there are no dragons in FotR,cept the cool fireworks.<br>
<br>
Good movie except i thought the Nazgul screams were a bit much to say the least.When frodo puts on the ring...Whoa,very coool!!<br>
<br>
Gonna read s'more and see if i can correct you again,hehe<br>
<br>
.....Lol,are you stoned??<br>
hehehe,very good synopsis anyho...<br>

<br>
Actually Golum had lost &quot;his precious&quot; and was searching for it desperately when Bilbo found it.<br>
<br>
The movie does change some parts of the story, but how else can you adapt such a rich story into hours of film.  Even 3 hours of film seemed to leave out big pieces.  Loved it anyway, can't wait til the next installments.  May even see the move again to catch more details.<br>

If that really is how you interpret and summarize the books, then maybe y'oughta switch to Heroin Light or Crack Ultra Mild.

snow was simply trying to give those that have not had an opportunity to read the book a basic idea of what to expect as far as its origins.<br>
<br>
even after reading the book some areas can be misinterpreted or incorrectly recalled when trying to tell the tale to others in a synopsis.<br>
<br>
unless you have read the book several times, are a stickler for remembering details, or have the book readily available to scroll through it is quite easy to get a few things mixed up.<br>
<br>
anyway good job snow on the summary for those who havent read the hobbit or fellowship and for those that have not read either of them i would really suggest doing so.<br>

he says that glorfindel tries to kill frodo and take the ring lol.<br>
and that the evil witch galadreil and arwen try to drown frodo in the river LOL<br>
<br>
There is a difference in missing a few details and what you see above.<br>
<br>
it was pretty funny read, i give him credit for that, he had me going until about half way threw , then i figgered he had to be jokin hehe<br>
<br>
read the whole thing rukkas, then you will see that hes joking.<br>
He mentions Radaghast, that is a character central to a place called cormyr from the Forgotten Realms D&amp;D campaing setting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvallaran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vallaran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dervish Cutthroat</span><br>  Posts: 157<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/28/01 12:01:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: nice tho</span><hr size=1> Actually though Chakan, there was a character in LotR named Radagast the Brown.

I am pretty sure they never actually specified what Gollum is/was. He is always referred to as simply a &quot;creature&quot;. Let me know if I am wrong. Also, Radaghast is in fact from the world of Tolkein as a couple others stated. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>
Long after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the Great River on the edge of the Wilderland a clever-handed and quiet-footed little people.  I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and often swam in it, or made little boats of reeds.  There was among them a family of high repute, for it was large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they had.  The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Smeagol.<br>

After Gandalf tells the entire story he discovered from Smeagol, Frodo says the following.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>
&quot;I can't believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however distantly,&quot; said Frodo with some heat.  &quot;What an abominable notion!&quot;<br>

These two quotes are found midway through the chapter. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvallaran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vallaran</A> at: 12/29/01 12:12:54 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessageRange?topicID=5753.topic&start=21&stop=31>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=5791.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=5785.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.emailToFriend?topicID=5753.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.threadControl?topicID=5753.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5753.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5753.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
