<br>
The past few days I participated in a pickup raid for the Plane of Hate.  While it was an enlightening experience, and was also my first time there, I do have a complaint (otherwise why would i be posting?)<br>
<br>
We cleared the first floor both nights, yet IMMEDIATELY after we were done, so many of the ppl left because they were &quot;tired, past bedtime, gotta work tomorrow...&quot; etc etc.  This is a load of BS.<br>
<br>
Of course you have to do stuff the next day, RL is a bitch.  I rarely have a free day between work and school when i can do a plane raid.  On the off occasion I do have a day when i can sleep in, i delight in going to the planes and staying up a bit late to get it cleared and get some nice loot.  Yet the past 2 nights i have gone to sleep early because some greedy looters decided &quot;ive gotten what i want, screw my fellow Norrathians&quot;<br>
<br>
I suggest a few things to these people who leave early.  First, take the next day off, or plan to come on a day you know you have the day off.  That way you can be courteous to everyone, and you won't piss ppl off like i have been pissed off.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, DONT COME.  I know you want loot on a raid, thats exactly why I went to Hate.  But if you're not able to stay the whole way through, your taking the spot of another person who might be able to stay the whole time.<br>
<br>
Despite the numerous grammatical errors, spelling errors, etc in this post, i feel i have gotten my idea across.  Please feel free to flame me at will, as my idea is probably rubbing the fair-weather fans the wrong way.  I dont care.  I doubt i will participate in a pickup raid in the future.  Though i met some wonderful people, and it was well organized (kudos to Dilandau, Chuchu, and everyone else who put their best effort forth on this one) some of the ppl just made me sick.<br>
<br>
In closing, some ppl had legitimate reasons for leaving when the did, and the following comment is not directed at them in the least.  To those who left because they got what they wanted and were done for the night, I pity you, and i pity those people you know in real life, as they must have to deal with a sad human being<br>

<br>
Because, the drops in PoF are sheeatt, TV sucks, i have better stuff from Kunark.  Hate has the new Ranger drops and  its very dissappointing not even taking a shot at the 2nd floor in 5 hate pickup raids.<br>
<br>
My only problem with the raids is that if you do have Faction considerations or you are not planning to try the 2nd floor PLEASE let the ppls know.  Either post your intensions or tell the player before you port up.  The raid was run well but there was little or no communication between the leaders and the rest of the raid. <br>
<br>
I appreciate the faction situation but i wouldnt spend over 8 hours in hate if there is no intension to go after the new mobs.<br>
<br>

If you go to raid STAY FOR THE WHOLE THING!<br>
I only leave if i have a very good reason. I never leave and then continue to play EQ off in OS or something. Thats sick. <br>
I would have to say that thing that pisses me off more than anything is when people say &quot;My guild needs me for a raid.&quot;<br>
I have heard this more and more as i fight in OS or go on pick-up raids. Thing is i still am yet to see someone who is telling the truth. I find out their guild and do a /who all &quot;x&quot; and am yet to find that they are doing a raid. Sometimes i have asked the person about this. Usually the excuse is that they are just getting ready or that they are going to help with a epic. Thing is I do the /who all &quot;x&quot; an hour later and am yet to see that person who was on the raid or in my group on a guild raid. I always see them in some other group(not a guild group) or going off to work on their own shit. <br>
Now if you have been in the group for 5 hours I don't have a problem with that. I think that is a good minimum time for OS. And yes, I have grouped for much shorter times their. But on those occasions I came on, saw that I had 5hrs or more, and got a group. Later that group breaks up and I try to make a new group or something.Other than that I just chat with friends or play my twink. What I hate is when you just enter the zone, go LFG, get into my group, and an hour later you say you have to go JUST after we get to the camp. This has happened one to many times for me and it's pissing me off. If your going to go on a raid or join a group STAY FOR THE WHOLE THING!<br>
Good reasons are always excepted of course~<br>
I know this is a bit off the subject, but I wanted to say this. Been getting at me for a while now.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umelfice2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Melfice2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333333>(3/30/01 9:52:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane Raids for all?</span><hr size=1> Yo Rhoerous,<br>

Lets be clear on one thing.<br>
<br>
Everquest is a GAME.  It is not real.  There is no Innoruuk in real life.  If u r going to get mad at someone for logging because they do not feel well, are tired, or have a real life engagement, you are taking the GAME too seriously and should cut back on your play time and go find out what the sun looks like again.<br>
<br>
I play all the time.  I was on 2 hate pickup raids in back to back nights and I live on the east coast.  I was there from beginning (9est) to end (4am and 6am respectively) and I get up for work at 7am.  This is my busiest time of year at work as well.  Yes, I am crazy, and it was the stupidest thing I could have done.  We killed a mob or 2 on the second floor but that is it.  Both times I got no loot, but if I got a RE BP would that make it better when I fuck something up at work and get fired?  Can I hock my RE BP (well on ebay i guess yea) to get rent money?  No.<br>
<br>
Once in awhile staying up late is fine if u want to.  I think people that attend raids to get their one piece and gate suck ass and are greedy and will not likely get reinvited to raids.  I think people who leave the raid with a lame excuse and then go off and do their own thing still online is bullshit as well.<br>
<br>
But to say that someone must cancel their life and take a day off of work or school to do a raid is very very silly.  Perhaps when u grow up u will learn that things in RL are more important than the game.<br>
<br>
Maybe.<br>

But no, i wasn't referring to you.  In fact, i am certain you DID have a good reason to leave.  Nobody would leave that early from any raid unless they had a good reason.<br>
<br>
I am referring to those people who suddenly got very tired after the 1st floor was cleared and all their mobs were dead.<br>
<br>
Broog, my god how stupid can you be.  OK lets go thru it again.  First of all no i dont think Innoruuk is real, nor do i have RL problems.  I simply believe it is POLITE to stay for the entire raid.  It is akin to being scheduled to work for 8 hours and deciding to go home after lunch.  The only difference between the 2 situations are that you dont normally get paid for taking a half day off.  Probably a bad comparison, ok.<br>
<br>
Second, thank you for at least agreeing with me that &quot;people who get their one piece then gate suck ass&quot;, as this was the main point of the post.<br>
<br>
The grow up thing..... age has little to do with Everquest.  One reason i love to play the game so much is that it removes the age barrier and allows people's real maturity level show through, without people assuming &quot;that stupid teenager really went crazy there&quot; etc etc.<br>
<br>
And to say someone must take a day off work is asking too much? Well ok, but if you can't attend a raid AND go to work after staying the whole time, once again DONT COME.  If you need to take a day off, then do it.  Just because you want your loot but dont give a shit about other people is no reason to be rude.  So when i say take a day off work, it is a suggestion of how to attend a raid in full, rather than a REQUIREMENT to attend a raid.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of the posts... thanks for the support, was just whining i suppose <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but in any case I appreciate the fact that others feel the same way as I do.

Most people figure ok hate raid scheduled lets say at 6est by the time we get up there (since pickup raids are always late) will be 8 then CR can be 30 min to 1.5 hours lets assume an hour to be fair... so at 9est we will start buffin etc and pulling at 915.<br>
<br>
Now hate I think is easy but once inawhile there are bad pulls.  There are more bad pulls on pickup raids it seems than guild raids.  Lets say, conservatively there are 3 bad pulls.  IF on all 3 bad pulls at least one cleric camps there is only 30 minutes of downtime (unless someone has a res stick).  So lets say 1.5 hours in cr-rebuff time could be less.  So 915 plus 1.5 hours is 1045.  Lets now estimate 4 hours to clear first floor?  Probably right in a pickup raid since some people may not be experienced or whatever it depends on the puller and number of people but I think 4 hours is not too bad maybe 3.5.  So at 3.5 hours from 1045 we are now talking at 215 we get to Maestro.  We buff up do tactics session kill maestro res everyone kill his hand lets say 45 minutes (prob faster than that i hope but have seen it take this long).  It is 3am.<br>
<br>
So now I am a decent player and I want to go to Hate and have some fun and maybe get some shaman gear.  I am on from 6pm EST to 3am EST.  Could the first floor be cleared by 11pm?  Sure!  Is it possible that a bad pull wipes all the clerics and we have some real trouble on CR?  Yep.  But to clear the first floor if someone alloted 9 hours and then has had enough I do not think that is a problem.  I went on back to back pickup raids was the only shaman for most of both nights and NO re stuff dropped.  I still had a blast and I waited up until Maestro was dead (only did him once).  But at some point I get tired too.<br>
<br>
I think it would be unfair to judge people as being greedy or selfish if they only allocate 6-9 hours to play the game.<br>
<br>
I was on another pickup raid I got midway thru on Sunday.  It was a bit disorganized and there was a wipeout and then a complete wipeout where clerics all died.  CR was a bitch.  Eventually a lot of people got fed up and left.  Crimson Tempest came with reinforcements and we rocked the first floor and Maestro and his gay hand.  It was 130 and I had to work Monday and I said I had to go.  I did win RE gloves that night.  Now CT may have only been there like 3 hours but I was on the plane all day.  If this makes me a greedy selfish player I guess I wont be invited to Hate again.  <br>
<br>
I am just sayin if the person leaves because they got an item they wanted then they suck.  But if someone is tired do not just assume they can take days off of work like u can or some other people can.  If u really feel someone sandbagged u then write down their name and dont let them in on raids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubroog72.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Broog72</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333333>(3/30/01 12:41:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane Raids for all?</span><hr size=1> Oh and btw call me a noob if u want but what are faction hits on second floor?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upetroglyph.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Petroglyph</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333333>(3/30/01 3:03:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane Raids for all?</span><hr size=1> You kill an ogre on the second floor, you lose ogre factions (whatever they are) and gain some good factions like Stormguard and so on..<br>

Sorry I don't know what all the faction names are for stuff but its relevant factions from the old world not new factions that dont matter.  Also thought it was funny loseing faction from InhabitantsOfHate....silly. <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=601" target="new"><b>Petroglyph Gatesalot</b></a><br>

I agree that it's a good estimate of how long a usual raid takes.  HOWEVER, these raids both ended up done with the first floor at 1am est.  Is it so unreasonable to ask 1 or 2 hours to do a little of the 2nd floor?  I would never expect to clear the whole floor, I have tracking and I saw how many mobs are up there...<br>
<br>
But I am talking about the sheer number of people who left right after 1st floor was done.  As I said before, specific names dont really matter, I've seen too many people do it.<br>
<br>
As for faction, that is the worst excuse i've ever heard.  The faction hits come from a very small number of the mobs up top, and even assuming you kill every one of those mobs, the faction hits cannot possibly put you from amiable to KOS, or even from dubious to KOS.  It is just another way for people to excuse themselves after they've gotten what they want.<br>
<br>
I think we are referring to 2 different things here.  Of course i would not want to go to 2nd floor with 1 chanter and a bare bones raid party of 46-52 ppl.  But on the 2nd night we started out with 48 people, and at least 12 of those were 52+.  Yet by 1am, poof! 3 clerics declare they are leaving, people are asking for ports.  The raid is done before the leader calls it.<br>
<br>
P.S. by this i don't mean to imply its the cleric's fault, simply that theyre leaving usually kills a raid...<br>

But its not hard to stay up an extra hour to help a raid rock some real mobs in hate. i mean they all are Poosays but hey its still fun <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=791.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.showMessage?topicID=811.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.threadControl?topicID=805.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/sofstky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=805.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=805.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="namelesstavernthenamelessserverboardrules">The Nameless Server Board Rules<option value="namelesstavernfrm9">Guild Links<option value="namelesstaverngeneraldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="namelesstavernfrm12">Nameless Polls<option value="namelesstaverndragonsandplanes">Dragons and Planes<option value="namelesstavernfrm11">Retirement Community<option value="namelesstaverntradingpost">Trading Post<option value="namelesstavernthenamelessroleplay">The Nameless Roleplay <option value="namelesstavernrantsandflames">Rants and Flames<option value="namelesstavernfrm8">Nameless Guild Leaders Lounge<option value="namelesstavernfrm18">Other Worlds<option value="namelesstavernfrm13">Administrative Requests<option value="namelesstavernfrm17">Signature Testing<option value="namelesstavernfrm16">LoS-Shock of Swords Collaboration</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern>The Nameless Tavern</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstaverndragonsandplanes>Dragons and Planes</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
