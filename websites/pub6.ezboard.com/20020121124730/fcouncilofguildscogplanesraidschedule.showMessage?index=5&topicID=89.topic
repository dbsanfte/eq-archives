The first was the choice of camp.  The only reason I bring this up is NOT because I thought it was a bad way to break into fear, but because breaking in that way requires much more time to do than west camp type break in.  This was monday, meaning a weekday, and people do have work and school the next day.  The way we broke in last night was fine for the weekend, but not for a weekday night, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Second thing was main assist.  The main assist needs to be someone that is alert at all times and has a good ISP connection.  I saw, on numerous occasions, single mobs penetrating the camp and a full 15 to 20 seconds going by before the main assist had it aquired and started attacking it.  The rest of us, by adhering to the rules, could do nothing but stab at our assist keys in vain.  Every tank was around the mob watching it pound the crap out of the casters, who were dropping like flies.  This is NOT acceptable.  Same thing was happening with multiple mobs.  If the main assist doesn't attack something, the enchanter doesn't know which of the other mobs to mezz, therefore letting them ALL run around smacking people.  The number of caster deaths as opposed to the number of tank deaths was ridiculous.  You can be the best main assist in the world but if you're having lag/ISP problems, it negates all that skill and you need to step aside and let someone else do the job.  Also, main assist does not need to be a warrior.  I have seen monks, SKs, rangers, and paladins be excellent main assists in both planes.  All you need is good armor class and a good cleric healing you.<br>
<br>
Third thing is pets.  I saw the pets attacking mobs by themselves while the rest of us were on another one.  Don't like this.  Don't like it at all.<br>
<br>
Fourth thing is DoTs.  People WERE dotting.  There had been an issue of mobs poofing if the person dotting wasn't making the hate list. I don't know if the issue has been resolved or corrected but I'd like to be on the safe side and have no DoTs in the planes.  Before we started pulling the raid leader specifically said that DoTs were not to be used and there is no question that some people disregarded that.<br>
<br>
Aside from those four things, I had a good time.  It was truly hilarious watching the planes newbies roll for Nightmare hide cloaks and Wraithstones.  I guess everyone wants a memento from their first time in Fear.  Congrats to all who got something to remember this night by.  GMs didn't need to be called in, and I've seen things get much more crazy in Fear than anything that happened last night. For a first planned raid here, I would call it a success.  Drops sucked,  But that's the way it goes sometimes.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(1/30/01 3:25:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildscogplanesraidschedule.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monday 1/29 Fear Recap</span><hr size=1> I think adding a no pets policy might be in order, as this is another thing I've seen a lot of talk about. We definitely need to make sure we don't have pets running around breaking mez and aggroing things. <br>
<br>
Not sure about the DoT's thing, as they might negate some of the SK and Necro strengths. <br>
<br>
Main assist does need a strong ISP connection, relatively lag free, etc. However, I will say that I've lately noticed in a lot of zones that assist just isn't working right. <br>

It was my first time at a break-in and didn't realize that it would take some time to get organized and set up at the camp.<br>
<br>
Haemish, I think you and Sacred Band did a great job.  These aren't easy to organize and keep everyone in tow.  The next one will be better and then the one after that and the one after that.  It was a good learning experience for everyone.  <br>
<br>
One thing I've noticed with CoG events is that communication has always been very, very good.   A lot of information is given in shouts and ooc so we know what's going on.  If someone doesn't know...then they aren't paying attention and possibly goofing around.  However, this IS a game so I think everyone is entitled to a little goofing around <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I had fun with my group members who seemed to support each other and other groups.  I hope I can make it to the next Planes Event.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all your hard work!<br>
