I believe u were the one who said that u don't want to be part of KCoG, and I want to help it get better and assist it in all ways possible. Tell me, who is open to growth here? The main point of my post was because your respect for Flarren and Lagdalen was inappropriate and its saddening that you would be so rude to somebody who puts hour after hour getting rdy, then working nonstop a whole night, just for our enjoyment. I'm sorry you feel that you need to bash them like this, and me. However, feel free because I don't really care and its obvious that the people who agree with ur comments either haven't posted or....there are none.<br>

I have been trained to believe that in order to be heard on a board such as this you must cause waves. It was never my intent to undermind nor laugh at the efforts of those that put effort into a council such as this. I am quite familiar with the CoG's purpose and have quietly followed it's progress from the start. <br>
<br>
 Let me first off comment on the Uber Player comment. Do you understand what it means to be uber? First there are limited resources on any given server. These resources come in many different forms, however the most crucial resource we have are players. Needless to say the small guilds and unguilded provide the greatest player base from which to draw from. CoG does draw upon this resource, whether intentional or not, it does have a strong player base. In this the CoG itself is 'uber'. So those that control the Cog will control this power base, and in this become uber themselves. Is it wrong of me to question the motives behind such actions?<br>
<br>
 Second as for the Elitest swine. When I offered my oppinions on what could've made the Naggy raid better, I was met with a due amount of scorn for the tone in which I presented my Ideas. When one rebutes such as this it is normally due to the fact that they see themselves as supperior. To me all elitest are swine.<br>
<br>
 Third I am confused. I just reread my original post. I can not find any form of personal attack against Lag or Flar. I will admit my statement about them not accepting any of the failure was wishful thinking, but as others have done before mistakes will be made and nothing can be done to unchange them.<br>
<br>
 With this being said I must say new conserns about the way the council is being handled have arisen in my mind. I will post these at a later date.<br>
<br>
 P.S. Euwyn, you did give the impression that you considered you played your part to perfection. I think in that case we both missed a few points. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Founder</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/19/01 4:59:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nagafen Recap</span><hr size=1> Sinian,<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what raid you were on, what rock you crawled out from under, or what CoG you've been tracking, but it isn't this one. First off, there are no LEADERS of the CoG, it is in its very inception a leaderless forum that does not answer to any one group or person, but instead to those who actually make the effort to get off of their collective or individual asses and DO SOMETHING. You are not one of those people. You are a follower, and a tick on the arse of the good people such as Lagdalen, Flarren, Pippi, Dogedme, Jzonn and yes, myself, who only follows us to see what can be gained from doing so. You ARE the exact type of person who does not help the CoG, yet benefits from it (or attempts to). <br>
<br>
The CoG is not &quot;uber.&quot; To be uber you must be elite in some way. Well, since the CoG has NO requirements to attend any events (other than signup for those events that can only take a limited number of people), nor are their any requirements to JOIN the CoG, other than making the effort to send an email to me (as the administrator of the board and Web site), I fail to see how we can be considered &quot;elitist swine.&quot; Matter of fact, we are about as &quot;un-elite&quot; as you can be... we'll take anybody, unwashed masses, uber geared elitist, guilded, unguilded, member or not. To be elitist, you must in turn be exclusionary, which, if you'd ever read or paid attention to ANY of the things the CoG has done, you'd know this. <br>
<br>
As for my removing you from the dragon mailing list, their are only 3 reasons anyone is ever removed by me from the dragon mailing list:<br>
1) Your email address bounces<br>
2) You request to be removed by email (for whatever reason)<br>
3) You put in some idiotic fake email address (Such as the monkey nuts who put in the address &quot;assweasel@monkeyfuck.net&quot; - got a laugh out of finding out that was a real doman). <br>
<br>
So one of the 3 things must have happened, probably #1, for me to have removed you. <br>
<br>
As for your attendance at future dragon raids, that's up to whoever is running said raid. I'm sure Lagdalen would not want you on one, and I certainly wouldn't. Yes, Lagdalen made some mistakes at Naggy, and she started out admitting them. She was farthest from not admitting her errors, and has taken heat because of them from people like you, who are not contributors, but detractors instead. It takes a real man to criticize someone without insulting them, to add something positive to the discussion instead of negativity. You are not such a man (or woman). <br>
<br>
That Lagdalen learned from her mistakes is obvious in the fact that Vox went down last night. Thankfully, she didn't have to deal with you on such an event. <br>
<br>
Go home. <br>

I've made mistakes in my posting, you've made mistakes in your posting. I wish I could just end this argument that we've evolved, but its obviously not that easy. I apologize for making myself seem like I thought I was &quot;perfect&quot;, because I sure don't think I am, nobody is. I REALLY didn't mean to leave that impression, thats a horrible thing to think of oneself(sp?). I'm agreeing to lay off ya, if you will do the same. The choice is yours. I'm not saying that others won't still be disappointed in your actions, but I personally made my point earlier not because I wanted to argue but b/c you said things to Lag and Flar that I detested. However, you apologized and told us u didn't mean to sound rude, so I no longer have much against you, so if you want to stop the arguing between us...<br>

<br>
 Would you please be so kind as to keep up on the conversation. The CoG is 'uber' in it's power base, you are more intellegent then to be blind to this fact. I assumed you had removed me from the list as I recieved no mail about the Vox raid, as others have come forward to say they were not notified. It was wrong of me to assume. As for my attendance with CoG dragon raids if Lag will not have me on them, then I suppose I shall not go. As it stands she is the dragon raid leader for the CoG. Now how a leaderless, Aliancless orginization assigns such a position is beyond me. I may be a tick on your arse, but I am here and I am doing something. My motives are my own, I only question your own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Founder</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/20/01 2:24:47 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nagafen Recap</span><hr size=1> My motives are to see this server get away from the selfish &quot;me me me&quot; loot mongering, no event type of community that existed before I started the CoG. Nothing more. I see many of these attitudes every day, and I saw a lot of them on the Nagafen raid. I see many people going to CoG raids because they view it as another avenue to get their &quot;phat lewtz.&quot; And I saw in your post, an attitude of &quot;I know better than the raid commander.&quot; Funny how I've never heard your voice other than in sardonic criticism. I've never seen you run any type of event that helps people other than yourself. Matter of fact, I've never seen you run an event. Now, I'm not omniscient, I'm also not always on. So please, enlighten me as to what kind of event you've run. Since you speak with such a voice of authority that is. <br>
<br>
Your comments were thinly veiled attacks on Lagdalen, attacks I knew she would have to endure, but undeserved attacks. Worse, they were thinly veiled attacks on the CoG, a body which you obviously know nothing about. Tell you what... when you've run a newbie tournament for 13 hours, giving up your time (very important) and a lot of your own items and items donated by a bunch of other guilds on the server (less important than their time), come back and talk to me. When you've run a Chess game tourney, or a walk across Antonica, or a newbie overwatch event, or a Staggerfest, or a naked troll run or any of the other type of events the CoG has run, come back and talk. <br>
<br>
Constructive criticism is one thing. You didn't use that. Lots of people can criticize. <br>
<br>
As for how Lagdalen got the job of raid leader, she and her guild exemplified the qualities needed to do it, and I asked her to do it, to take the place of the Sacred Band when it was time for us to do our own. Just like I asked Jzonn, Ameron, and Cyan before I did it. When you have demonstrated that you could accomplish the same, I'll ask you. Oh wait, that'll never happen. <br>
<br>
As for the CoG being UBER, it would need to have a leader that everyone follows, who has power to enforce things. It does not. People often try to say that I am the leader... I am the founder, and probably the loudest voice. That does not make me leader. The component guilds of the CoG have no obligation to follow my word anymore than they do anyone else on the server. <br>

I can tell however you do not accept my appology. To many times I have worked on stengthing a guild, watched the people by pass me in lvls and get to a point where they only see the furtherment of their own charatcer on the planes or through the dragons. They then realise that the only way they can attain such places is through the CoG. They get frustrated with this and leave for a well established guild/alliance. Perhaps this is my error in not involing the guilds I have worked with, and showing them the true power they have to do such things with the CoG.<br>
<br>
 Everyone keeps asking about my own expirence with events that I have ran. Well the majority of raids that I have done have been small consisting of 2-3 groups. I have taken down Runnyeye, Najena, Mistmoore, Kaeorsa, Dalnir, and SolA with such raids just to name a few. I have put together Newbie watches, trick or treat hunts, lvl 1 championship style duels, and a number of other fun events. I have not openned up my events on a server wide basis as most of these were designed to strethen my own guilds in a sence of community and camadreship. The Naggy raid was my final hurrah after watching the Kindred of the Moon disintegrate because we were reliant on the CoG. If the CoG exists truly as you claim it does then it has been my error in not involving my guild with such a power base. However with the way I have seen it structured over the past year, I could not allow my guild to become a pawn for the leaders of the CoG.<br>
<br>
 I am not a guild leader or officer. I have been asked by my guild leaders on a number of occasions to take an officership role and have always declined based on the need of the members of the guild to chose me as their leader verbally. I have not approached my guild leaders with the possability of openning up my events to the CoG, nor have they posted the question to me. This may change, currently I am planning a raid on Mistmoore, the Tower of Frozen Shadows, the Hunter/Forager cycle in Trak's Teeth, the Burynai/Brute cycles in Frontier Mountains and a number of other fun events. When I find myself more in line with this new guild I have chosen, I may start to open my events to the CoG as a means of keeping my guild strong and happy till we can reach a point of doing things on our own. This decision is not mine to make as I am not an officer of my guild, it is possable that my guild leader has other plans of which I am not aware. I leave it to myself then to remain a member of a small guild or even unguilded soul as I have been in the past. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uflarrenlagdalen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flarren Lagdalen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>King and Queen of Lag</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/20/01 11:19:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nagafen Recap</span><hr size=1> I've remained silent cause I believe all I had to say was said. You mentioned above that the only way you saw to get a post recognized was to be confrontational about it. It's possible that on some boards thats the case, or maybe within some guilds you dont get noticed without making waves, but I like to think that the best criticism is the constructive kind. Your original post (to a degree) was subtle in its malevolence but you knew it would get a reaction, which I understand was your point for it. I read all the Advice which is written out and analyze if I could have used it to better what I did. In my response to you I believe I responded with my reasons why/why not and how I believed things went right or wrong.<br>
<br>
I didn't have blinders on, and I am more than willing to take constructive criticism when it is given. Many of the things posted I adapted to Vox if I believed it would honestly help but each idea was submitted with good intentions. There is no need to create a controvercial post here just to get attention to it, I would have read it all the same.<br>
<br>
To why people didn't like listening on the Naggy raid I have no idea. Maybe they were from small guilds that had never done a major raid before and didn't understand the importance of listening as much as others. Maybe I DID make some enemies along the way that just wont speak up, I have no clue. I am very leery to threaten and maybe by not taking a firmer hand to things people thought they could get away with things. I can asure you that wont be happening again. I dont go overboard BUT I will be handing out warnings more often if needed.<br>
<br>
Like it or not to everyone I believe everyone deserves a chance to clear their name. If you are willing to participate in another raid I will not deny you BUT when you comment after, or need to make yourself heard I'm asking that you have a bit more respect for everyone as a person in real life with real feelings. Your post really hurt, but I am going to forget what I read and see if we can go back and try again. It's in your lap now if you wish to participate constructively.<br>

The CoG raids is about experiencing it and meeting new people and maybe even form guild alliances based on meeting likeminded guilds.<br>
<br>
As for why guilds split apart when they don't seem to be able to handle planes or dragons without the CoG, quite honestly, I see that problem with the KGC, not the CoG.  The KGC enforces that people don't have the chance to go to the planes or dragons too often and in effect forces people to either band into large guilds or alliances that are exclusive and don't overlap in membership. So people leave to either join those guilds or alliances.  Relying on the CoG for that responsibility is not really fair in my opinion because that's not what the CoG is for. <p><HR>

However this is the case with many guilds. I propose we encourage guilds to set it upon themselves to plan their own dragon raids and to list themselves on the KGC's rotation, and let them know that the support to do such things can be found in the CoG. The CoG should also remain as is, on the rotation itself, but mostly to show people how to run such a raid. In other words quit giving me fish and hand me a pole. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukatellin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katellin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/21/01 7:30:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nagafen Recap</span><hr size=1> You need to go to KGC borad and read the rules. There are alot of things they just wont allow you to do. Such as on large targets (naggy,vox,cazzic,ect..) the guild/alliance must be able to take target down without the help from others that are also in the rotation for the same target. So therefore if you sign your guild/alliance up in the rotation you must be able to do it yourselves with minimal guests including from CoG cause they are a alliance as the KGC looks at it. I beleive the raiding party should mainly consist of people of the guild/alliance that is signed up in the rotation. I suggest finding out all the rules to the KGC and how they run things. Also would like to say is that your not gonna get the smoothest raid everytime when its different people with different experience doing the raid each time. To get the smoothness more often you do them with the same people day in and day out, hence the guild/alliance. KGC encourages guilds getting into alliances that have trouble takeing out some targets. Also think of it this way... How many people go to the planes with CoG? How many can go on a single raid. I know the the number to the first one is way way bigger than the number of the second one. CoG i think in my opinion would be better off if more people steped up and made alliances with others for their own running of target/planes raids. I think the smaller you get that first number the better and more smooth it might be. Just my opinion though.... <p>Katellin Majere 53rd Human Wizard - Muji 55th Human Monk - Fellowship of Faydark</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhaemish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haemish</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>CoG Founder</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/21/01 9:16:51 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.godwin.com/sd/haemish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nagafen Recap</span><hr size=1> Sinian, <br>
<br>
If you'd been paying attention to the CoG for the last year, if you've read any of the meeting logs, or read up, you would see that I've been trying to hand people a pole, as you say, all along. <br>
<br>
I've have ALWAYS said that the CoG is only as strong as the members who wish to do things for others OUTSIDE their guild, their alliance, or the CoG. If you want to learn how to fish (or kill a dragon), you can go on a CoG raid. If you want the CoG to hand you the fish every time (i.e. killing a dragon), you're in the wrong place. For months now, I've been talking up the idea of smaller guilds forming alliances to do their OWN plane and dragon raids. I've preached this over and over. In one case, I've actually tried to put 3 guilds together in email, just to get them to meet and consider it. The CoG planes and dragon raids are not and should not be considered the only way for you to get to the planes. But in order to do planes by yourselves as a small guild, you will either need very high levels (about 18 or so above 50's), or you will need numbers - which means an alliance. Yes, doing things like you've mentioned does strenghten your own guild. But doing those same things AND opening them up to the whole server not only strengthens your guild, it strenghtens the people who run the event, and if puts your guild's name out there as one who is open, friendly, and wants to do things for other guilds. I can tell you now... the Silver Daggers did not get to be a guild of almost 100 strong quality people by just doing things for itself. We did many CoG events, we got our name out their on everyone's lips and we built up alliances based on friendship. Now we are in an alliance with 3 other guilds, total membership well over 200 people, and are doing the planes and dragons on our own. <br>
<br>
As for your guild being pawns of the CoG, you need to stop looking at the CoG as some massive conspiracy to control the server. Almost everything that has gone on with the CoG has happened in a public forum, or in public meetings with logs posted afterwards. Your guild should be the one using the CoG... it is a tool. <br>

Just a thought.<br>
<br>
One more thing when you hold an event does it bother you if you say to attck a mob and someone says no lets attack that one instead? Then you die because your attacking 1 mob and the others didnt listen to you the leader of said raid they decide its best to attack the othe mob against what you as the leader said.Hence the I waited till naggy was 20%.<br>
<br>
I wish you well in your travels and your life sinian you will need it. May Brell watch over your soul and grant you the wisdom that you will need to survive.<br>

 I do realize my own errors on that Naggy raid. I also relize that I was overly harsh in my estimation of the leadership style of Lag on that raid. I have posted my appology. Accept it or not, the choice is yours.<br>
<br>
 However I am faced with my own decision now. I know I must first discuss it with my previous guild leaders and current guild leader. If I decide one way then I am posed to use the CoG as a tool, if I decide on the other then this entire discussion has been futile. Safe travels to you all no matter what I decide. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=112.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=112.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessage?topicID=117.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showMessage?topicID=118.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=112.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.threadControl?topicID=112.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=112.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=112.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="councilofguildsgeneral">General<option value="councilofguildscouncildiscussions">Council Discussions<option value="councilofguildsevents">Events<option value="councilofguildscogplanesraidschedule">CoG Planes Raid Schedule<option value="councilofguildsfrm8">CoG Dragon Raids<option value="councilofguildsguildwars">Guildwars<option value="councilofguildshelpitemswanted">KCoG Bazaar<option value="councilofguildsintroduceyourguild">Introduce Your Guild<option value="councilofguildsguildalliances">Guild Alliances</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#8E9173>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bcouncilofguilds>Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8>CoG Dragon Raids</a> <font color=#8E9173> - </font><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/haemish">Karana Council of Guilds</a><font color=#8E9173> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://clicks.about.com/157/spkcpa.asp?PM=485_d_ezboard_spcpa&rURL=https%3A//sprinks.about.com/userforms/create_user.htm%3Fpc%3Dd_ezboard" target="_blank">
