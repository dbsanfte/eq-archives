<br>
Just a quick note before the story continues...<br>
<br>
This chapter (like all the previous chapters) are wildly dramatized versions of what Uhrlik has actually done in-game. While this may seem like a raid gone bad, it is simply written in the fashion of the previous chapters.<br>
<br>
Also, I'd like to give a hearty thank you to Scions of Veeshan for allowing me to tag along on their Hate raid over a year ago. It was my first Planes experience and this chapter is (extremely) loosely based on that raid.<br>
<br>
/ooc off<br>
<br>
The Story of Uhrlik:<br>
Faith and the Faithless<br>
<br>
<br>
         It was night in Kelethin. The night birds warbled their songs of joy<br>
and the crickets chirped in chorus. The darkened air was alive with the<br>
symphony of shadows. Even here Uhrlik found little peace. The warring in his<br>
soul never waned, especially here, in the place of his earliest failure and<br>
tragedy. The wooden walls of his parents' home glared at him, shouting<br>
silent accusations. He had been too weak, then, too soft. He had vowed that<br>
would never happen again. <br>
<br>
          &quot;Uhrlik?&quot; Lamila asked with concern strong in her voice.<br>
<br>
         She had startled him, and he jumped in his chair. It was the same<br>
chair that he sat in when he watched his mother pass, he realized absently.<br>
&quot;Yes, Heart?&quot;<br>
<br>
         &quot;Turn out the lantern and come to bed, dear. You need to sleep<br>
eventually.&quot;<br>
<br>
         &quot;I will, soon.&quot; He lied.<br>
<br>
         She laughed lightly, like flower petals on the wind, &quot;Don't make me<br>
put you to sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
          The warrior turned his head toward her. The concern that had laden<br>
her voice was dwarfed by the worry and fear in her eyes. The way that the<br>
dim lamplight caught her features took his breath away. &quot;I will try.&quot; Uhrlik<br>
smiled, trying to seem more convincing.<br>
<br>
         Lamila pursed her lips thoughtfully. She doubted he would sleep a<br>
wink that night, but she let the issue go. She trusted him in ways that he<br>
did not completely understand, and she never ceased to amaze him. A moment<br>
later and she rolled over and went back to sleep.<br>
<br>
         Uhrlik leaned over and blew out the lantern and sat there in the<br>
dark, listening to the song and the rage pulsing against each other,<br>
thundering through his veins like wild horses. Ever since his confrontation<br>
with the fallen knight Sir Lucan D'Lere, it seemed that the song was losing<br>
ground and that terrified the warrior.<br>
<br>
         Hours passed and Uhrlik's jaw began to ache. Abruptly he became<br>
aware of his teeth grinding so hard that his ears were ringing and the<br>
thoroughly ruined pewter mug biting into his hand. The water that had filled the mug<br>
before had long since dried, leaving only a small stain on the wooden<br>
tabletop. Uhrlik worked his sore jaw and stiff fingers as he loosed the<br>
remnants of the mug.<br>
<br>
         Sunlight began to creep across the sky. The air was filled with a<br>
silence like life waiting to happen. Lamila began to stir and stretch in bed<br>
and Uhrlik jumped out of his chair. He snatched up the crushed mug and<br>
looked for a place to hide it. A stab of pain in his legs like those damnable brownie<br>
spears reminded the warrior that he hadn't moved from his vigil in the chair<br>
for long hours. Grimacing in silent pain he saw that Lamila was rolling to<br>
face him, scrubbing sleep from her groggy eyes. Panic set in and he flung<br>
the blasted goblet out the nearest window and smiled breathlessly.<br>
<br>
         Lamila eyed him uncertainly but shook her head thinking it best not<br>
to ask. When she left the room for her morning cleaning he sighed heavily in<br>
relief.<br>
<br>
         The warrior set to polishing his armor and ensuring the edges on his<br>
blades. He sat cross-legged on the bed and watched Lamila in her morning<br>
ritual. She glanced at him and stopped.<br>
<br>
         &quot;What are you smiling at?&quot; She beamed a smile back at him a little<br>
self-consciously.<br>
<br>
         Uhrlik realized then that he was smiling and he had a warm feeling<br>
welling up in him. He was certainly no stranger to this feeling, but it<br>
often showed itself entirely of its own volition. The moments when his love<br>
for Lamila took over were the times that the rage completely disappeared.<br>
&quot;Just you, Heart.&quot; He consciously left his smile intact.<br>
<br>
         Lamila rolled her eyes and laughed, &quot;If you say so. You remember<br>
that I have a meeting with the Circle of Elders today, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
              He nodded.<br>
<br>
         &quot;So what do you plan on doing while I'm there?&quot; She asked wryly<br>
while tugging at her belt.<br>
<br>
         &quot;As little as possible.&quot; He grinned. That usually meant that he was<br>
going to go slaughter some orcs for a while and spend the rest of the day<br>
behind a forge or fiddling with his fletching kit.<br>
<br>
         &quot;Well I'll be back as soon as I can.&quot; His wife punctuated with a<br>
final twitch of her stubborn belt. Nodding, she strode to face Uhrlik. A hug<br>
and a kiss goodbye and she marched out the door as if she was marching into<br>
battle. Of course, Uhrlik remembered the Circle of Elders and he was not<br>
sure that she wasn't marching into battle.<br>
<br>
         Hours passed, orcs died swiftly and in great numbers. The sun<br>
started to sink below the horizon and the blue sky of Greater Faydark<br>
deepened to a rich amethyst. Lamila still had not returned from her meeting<br>
with the Circle of Elders, but Uhrlik sat in icy silence next to a merchant<br>
while deftly fletching arrows.<br>
<br>
         &quot;Well this is an interesting sight.&quot; A familiar feminine voice said wryly.<br>
&quot;The battle hungry Uhrlik, quiet and productive. You may become housebroken yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
         Uhrlik shot a glare up at the woman preparing to unleash his<br>
venomous words on her, but his rage melted at the sight of Annastrianna. &quot;It<br>
has been too long, Anna,&quot; he smiled warmly. &quot;What brings you back here?&quot;<br>
<br>
         &quot;You,&quot; she said at once. &quot;I have someplace to take you, but we must<br>
go quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
         The warrior saw the grim determination on her face and nodded. He<br>
closed his kit and shoved it carelessly in his pack. He cinched his loosened<br>
breastplate and followed quickly after her.<br>
<br>
         A short distance away, Anna stopped before a rugged half-elf. He was<br>
shifty eyed and unshaven, with oily hair and a sickly smile. &quot;Let's go,&quot; she<br>
commanded him.<br>
<br>
         The man began to focus the way that Lamila did when about to<br>
teleport them somewhere, and a moment later he found himself in the familiar<br>
desert surroundings of South Ro. The druid bowed deeply and silently to<br>
Annastrianna and disappeared.<br>
<br>
         Anna took Uhrlik by the wrist and began a breathless march toward<br>
the wizard pyramid. What awaited Uhrlik nearly took his breath away.<br>
<br>
         A veritable army waited at the base of the tower. Every race of<br>
Norrath save the Teir'Dal was represented. Warriors tightened their armor or<br>
sharpened their weapons impatiently. Paladins and Rangers prayed, while<br>
Monks practiced their meditative dances, channeling their energies and<br>
centering their minds. Clerics and Shaman moved swiftly through the mass of<br>
bodies casting their wards and shields while Bards and Enchanters kept their<br>
minds clear and their energies strong.<br>
<br>
         Still gripping his wrist, Anna pulled Uhrlik along through the crowd<br>
while a warrior atop the pyramid was giving orders to begin going up. &quot;Going<br>
up?&quot; Uhrlik asked Anna, confused.<br>
<br>
         &quot;You'll see.&quot; She gave him a wry grin, but her eyes were heavy with<br>
apprehension.<br>
<br>
         Uhrlik raised an eyebrow in question.<br>
<br>
         &quot;We're getting a chance at revenge.&quot;<br>
<br>
         Wizards were moving through the throng, one stopping before the pair<br>
before Uhrlik could question her further.<br>
<br>
So intent was Uhrlik on Anna that he had failed to notice that a jovial looking high elf cleric and a massive barbarian shaman had joined them. The shaman glanced down to meet Uhrlik’s eye and grinned feverishly. “Today is a good day to die.” The man bellowed, “May you die with honor and purpose.” The nearby barbarians heard him and echoed him in their own deep, booming voices, “Honor and purpose!”<br>
<br>
        The warrior felt the air sizzle and turned to face the wizard. The man had his eyes closed as he muttered strange, spidery words and tightly clutched a blackened, sickly gem that oozed corruption.<br>
<br>
        Suddenly, the gem cracked and a black light showered down around them, encompassing them. Reality screamed in agony as the wizard ripped a precise hole in the very fabric of the Universe with his mind. The tear folded around the group, the darkness swallowing all sight.<br>
<br>
        Sensation disappeared. There was no sense of motion, but this blank space in Time gave the impression that they were no longer on Norrath, that somehow they had passed beyond their mortal Plane and were traveling in the empty spaces of the Gods.<br>
<br>
        An indeterminate amount of time passed -it felt like years but could only have been moments- the hole opened again and disgorged the group. A dark and narrow room stood silent before them, the bodies of several massive and obviously diseased rats spread across the floor. The advance groups had cleared the vermin from the room and were now tending their wounds.<br>
<br>
        The corruption of this place was nearly tangible, like slimy fingers caressing the soul. In this place the song in Uhrlik’s heart faded to a whisper while the rage exalted in its freedom. It burned and danced and celebrated this place so strongly in his veins and in his stomach that the warrior fell to his hands and knees and retched.<br>
<br>
        The shaman chuckled at him knowingly as the stricken Uhrlik fought to control his roiling, convulsing belly. A moment later, Annastrianna helped him to his feet.<br>
<br>
        “What is this place?” He questioned her in a rough, hoarse whisper.<br>
<br>
        She grimaced as if she, too, was about to sick up. “Welcome to the Plane of Hate.”<br>
<br>
        Uhrlik stared at her in disbelief. Hate, the home of the Dark Prince and the father of the Dark Elves. He nearly threw up again.<br>
<br>
        Just then, the army heard a scrabbling sound as more rats clawed their way through the walls and dropped into the middle of the room. Uhrlik’s group backed towards one wall to face what looked like colossal cathedral doors. The wood was slick and black with stained glass windows at the crest that were mercifully too filthy to see clearly.<br>
<br>
        The cleric shoved against the heavy doors until he was panting and red in the face. He chuckled and shrugged at the rest as the shaman took his turn. Soon, the shaman fell limp to the floor, wheezing and frustrated. Annastrianna moved toward the doors as Uhrlik lay a hand on her shoulder.<br>
<br>
        “Let me give it a try.”<br>
<br>
        “Aye,” the shaman puffed, “Let the big, strong meat shield have a go at it.” He laughed deeply despite being out of breath.<br>
<br>
        Standing before the door, Uhrlik could see that the army was forming up behind him. They stared at him, at the doors, waiting. The Ogres, the Iksar, the High Elves, the Half Elves and Humans. All waited at his back and he knew exactly what to do.<br>
<br>
        He raised his left hand and struck the door with the butt of his leaf-bladed sword. The blow echoed through the walls, through the entire Plane. Slowly, the doors began to slide open.<br>
<br>
        Slick black filth fell from the doors in heavy clumps and thudded on the dusty cobble stone floor. A gust of wind burst from beyond the doors and the air groaned and stank with the scent of death awakening. A black mist oozed from the cracks in the stones, cackling spitefully, and everywhere that it caressed felt somehow infected.<br>
<br>
        The army marched heedlessly into the outer reaches of Innoruuk’s home. A city, complete with homes and taverns and shop fronts, seemed somehow stunted by the high stone walls leading to a mysterious second floor. The city seemed vaguely familiar, almost like Freeport in its design and layout.<br>
<br>
        There was no light here, but a strange purple luminescence emanated from everywhere and nowhere. It was bright enough for his Elven vision to see clearly, but the humans must certainly be at a loss here.<br>
<br>
        Suddenly, the silence was shattered by a soul-rending howl. From around the corner of a two-story inn came the citizens of this twisted city. They were as tall as an Ogre, wrapped in ancient and paper-thin cloth wrappings. They appeared emaciated; the hate that had burned in them in life had burned away their minds and rotted their bodies while sustaining them, giving them an unnatural existence. Their faces were frantic and feral, snarling and desperate to destroy the interlopers.<br>
<br>
        Clouds of black spores exploded from their bodies with every slash, sickening all around them. The healers cast deftly to remove the toxins from the nauseated combatants while the fight raged on. More and more of the ragged things came, sometimes bringing the diseased rats with them.<br>
<br>
        When all had fallen before the army, the next wave struck. They stood as tall as a barbarian and wore heavy plate armor. An unholy strength raged in their bodies as they were compelled to their core to destroy the invaders. The Dark Clerics healed each other and occasionally their hands would blaze red and an unfortunate aggressor would fall to the ground shrieking and clutching their head.<br>
<br>
        The sinister inhabitants raged on, swarming into the army with wanton bloodlust. Their strength and numbers increased as the legion drew closer to the center of the city, towards the twisted black palace of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
        Only the tips were visible over the two-story homes, but Uhrlik could see the tortured stone turrets and the ghastly stained glass windows shaped like laughing, toothless maws. He hated this place. He hated it with every fiber of his being.<br>
<br>
        Still the children of the Dark Prince flooded into the gathered mass, trying to drive them out with a bestial rage. Each fight grew closer to the army’s destruction as the soldiers weakened from exhaustion, disease and the Dark Cleric’s smite. Uhrlik’s arms were getting tired, and he realized that he was not swinging as hard or from as high as he had at the start of the invasion.<br>
<br>
        Annastrianna glanced over at Uhrlik with concern strong on her face. She moved through the crowd towards him, her hands drenched in a blue light. At a touch, Uhrlik felt his weariness fading, but they both knew that they could not keep up this pace for much longer.<br>
<br>
        After so long in battle, Uhrlik began to notice things. He noticed them distantly, as if he were a casual observer watching from some far off place. He saw the light emanating from their weapons and armor, their spells and explosions and it seemed that they beamed with the light of conviction and justice. It seemed that they were all the light in the universe, slowly fading under the crushing weight of the Dark Prince’s horde.<br>
<br>
        He passed over an enchantress huddled on the cobblestone street weeping in fear and exhaustion. Nearby, a paladin was drowning under the relentless assault of the foul mummies. A warrior screamed in anguish as a Dark Cleric punctured his breastplate and the flesh beneath. The rancid vermin rained from the darkness above onto a cleric and she was run down crying and begging. Whether begging for deliverance or mercy, he could not say. Sound had disappeared, replaced only by the rhythmic thumping of his own heart.<br>
<br>
        Their light flickered as more heroes fell. The repulsive denizens began to sneer with confidence. Their hate-tortured faces made the grin even more disturbing.<br>
<br>
        Uhrlik watched it all impassively, knowing that they were all doomed. They were all going to die and he wouldn’t be able to say goodbye to Lamila.<br>
<br>
        Suddenly, at the moment of their victory, the wardens of Hate backed off and disappeared into the shadows. Confusion and apprehension spread through the remaining invaders.<br>
<br>
        Sound returned slowly, but the first thing Uhrlik heard was “Begin the evacuation.” He turned to find the Half Elf warrior that had given the orders from atop the pyramid speaking to a small cluster of druids and wizards. His armor was dented and cut in a hundred different places, and he bled from at least a dozen. One large chunk of his breastplate appeared to have been bitten off. “We need to get out of here now.” He jabbed a finger at them for emphasis.<br>
<br>
        Slowly, a sound began to emanate from the palace like a rising tide. It sounded like a symphony of screams, an organ playing a terrible yet beautiful melody. Muted voices whispered, “The Maestro.” One of the druids nodded and squeaked, “If he’s playing that means…”<br>
<br>
        “You don’t belong here.” Uhrlik heard a deep, tense voice speak in his mind. It had the sound of a string wound too tightly, ready to snap at any moment. He heard it in Common and Elvish, Ogre and Dragon. It conveyed its message in every language of Norrath at once, and Uhrlik knew immediately where the voice was coming from.<br>
<br>
        The shadows began to solidify, slithering and congealing into a colossal man-shape. It pulsed with fraud and glowed with the essence of vice.<br>
<br>
        Thoughts came unbidden to the warrior’s mind. He began eyeing his fellows with suspicion and loathing. The rage echoed in his veins, vibrating in time to the heartbeat of the man-shape. It welled up in him and he roared in exultation.<br>
<br>
        Suddenly, he felt a flash of pain and the world went dark briefly. He found himself on the ground with Anna standing over him. A trickle of blood ran down the corner of his mouth. He watched a drop of his blood drip slowly from her hand and snarled.<br>
<br>
        The warrior stood slowly, his hate filled eyes never leaving hers. She cocked her fist back to hit him again, anguish in her eyes. Anguish? He thought to himself. He blinked and shook his head furiously.<br>
<br>
        Looking around, Uhrlik saw that the thoughts had affected his fellows as well. Some were shouting at each other, some glaring. A paladin and a shaman had taken to outright hostility. The steel of their spear and sword clashing soundlessly, swallowed by the hatred of this place.<br>
<br>
        He turned to Anna, “Thank you.” He said breathlessly.<br>
<br>
        She waved him off, “You would have done the same thing for me.”<br>
<br>
        Uhrlik chuckled, “I may yet.”<br>
<br>
        Anna smiled briefly and turned to the others. She ran through the afflicted masses shaking them to their senses.<br>
<br>
        The boiling haze began to dissipate revealing a massive form underneath. The skin was as pale as death and mottled with purple patches stretched taut over a thin, wiry frame. He had hands with long, dexterous fingers tipped with claws and stained with ancient blood to his elbows.<br>
<br>
        The Dark Prince strode confidently toward the remnants of the army. He wore a loathsome sneer that seemed nearly a smile, but his eyes blazed with pure hatred. It pulsed within Uhrlik’s veins and he began to understand the god. He was alone. He was ugly and lonely. He hated mortal life almost as much as he hated his own.<br>
<br>
        A new rage began to well in Uhrlik’s heart. So much pain had been caused by this pathetic wretch of a god. So much of the injustice and intolerance that plagued Norrath had been wrought to buy the momentary satisfaction of this impish, pitiable thing.<br>
<br>
        Innoruuk turned to the young warrior and glared. “There is potential in you, half elf.”<br>
<br>
        “Potential you shall never possess.” Uhrlik stated icily.<br>
<br>
        “I remember your father, boy. He had genius as well as potential.” Innoruuk sighed in nostalgia. “I truly hated giving him to my Maestro. He sings a fine C-sharp now, do you hear him?”<br>
<br>
        The warrior closed his eyes and listened. He heard a single note in the horrid, wailing aria stand above all others. It was the sound of his father in a state of constant agony, primed by the Maestro to perform a single perfect note with his pain.<br>
<br>
        “I will free him and return him to my mother.”<br>
<br>
        Innoruuk dismissed him with a shrug, “As you say, little one. But with every day my blood flows even stronger in you. Revenge is my tool, use it now if you dare. Or did that elf wench’s blood stunt you with cowardice?”<br>
<br>
        Uhrlik’s hands tightened on his weapons and he gritted his teeth, “You go too far, you feeble wretch. But that’s your game, isn’t it? You’re trying to provoke me to hate you, aren’t you?” The warrior laughed, “You are truly sad. In my heart, you are impotent!”<br>
<br>
        The Dark Prince gnashed his rotted teeth and clutched his tainted hands in rage. “We shall see, boy.”<br>
<br>
        Behind Uhrlik the party had reformed itself and was beginning to evacuate. Portals opened like spots of light and the army disappeared. A wizard followed Annastrianna as she approached the warrior.<br>
<br>
        “We are leaving now.” She said in haste, dragging Uhrlik by the arm.<br>
<br>
        The last few huddled together as the wizard summoned his energies.<br>
<br>
        Innoruuk lunged forward, his foul arm passing by Uhrlik and snatching Annastrianna from the press. His eyes gleamed with a bright purple light and she shrieked with the pain of a million lifetimes.<br>
<br>
        “NO!” The warrior screamed in misery.<br>
<br>
        Turning his back to the remaining survivors, Innoruuk cackled whimsically and cast the husk of Annastrianna over his shoulder where it came to rest directly at Uhrlik’s feet.<br>
<br>
        She gasped and fought for air and a tear rolled down her cheek. Uhrlik laced his hand into hers and she wept harder. The paladin fixed her fading gaze on her friend and whispered to him, “Honor and Purpose.”<br>
<br>
        Her hand still firm in his grip slipped weakly to the cobblestone ground as she slipped into silence.<br>
<br>
        There in the dark place of Innoruuk, Annastrianna, the devout paladin of Tunare, a dejected half elf’s first true friend, died.<br>
<br>
        The air screamed again as the portal ripped through the planes. They once again found themselves on the dusty landscape of South Ro. The blood red sun was setting slowly, and the warrior wept in the fading light.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik could still feel her hand in his as she faded away. Something felt odd, though. He opened his hand to find a small ring. He knew immediately that it was Anna’s though he had only seen it once before. <br>
<br>
It was delicate, almost fragile. Made of mithril and decorated in exquisite detail, it had a single emerald shaped like a great tree in the center, with what seemed like carvings of a family history encircling it. Anna had always been impervious to questions about her past, but he had little idea that she had been nobility. Only a noble family could have possessed so fine a ring. And with the royal seal on the inside!<br>
<br>
He stuffed the ring into his belt pouch, absently laying his hand over it. Staring at the sunset he mumbled, “This never should have happened.”<br>
<br>
The wizard stepped in front of him, glaring. “A lot of good people died today, my friends, all of them. They were loyal to the cause, determined to restore justice in the world. None of them should have died, either.”<br>
<br>
“It should have been me. He killed her to goad me into hating him.”<br>
<br>
“Then it seems you have a choice. Either you hate him or you don’t.”<br>
<br>
“I understand him.”<br>
<br>
The wizard blinked at him in confusion. “Then what are you going to do?”<br>
Uhrlik took in a deep breath, “Honor and Purpose.” He smiled faintly and his skin tingled as he turned to walk away.<br>
<br>
Feeling numb, the warrior barely noticed the change in terrain as he ran through the desert until his feet were planted upon the deck of the Siren’s Bane. He was heading back to Greater Faydark, heading home to Lamila.<br>
<br>
Sailing through the Ocean of Tears, Uhrlik found himself remembering the time he first met Anna. He remembered her saying how they’d bring down the doors of Hate together. He was grateful to the sea, then. It wailed in anguish like he could not, so close was his grief.<br>
<br>
It was raining in Greater Faydark as he trudged up the lift and toward his home. The door flew open as his hand reached for it. Lamila pulled him into the house with unparalleled speed and force. She held him close and began to cry herself, but hers were tears of relief.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik held her in his pain, the rain blowing in through the open door. He could not begin to care about a damp rug, or that his cloak was soaked through. He was home, he was with his wife. Somehow, things would go on.<br>
<br>
Hours passed and Uhrlik sat by the fire with a bowl of stew. He watched as Lamila fussed with the damp rugs and his thoroughly drenched cloak. She babbled about her meeting with the council while he sat and listened, nodding in all the right places, smiling when she apologized for rambling.<br>
<br>
He explained what had happened to him, starting off with “Anna is dead.” Lamila stopped talking suddenly, her jaw dropped open. He laid Anna’s ring on the table and went through the tale, leaving out the part about his father.<br>
<br>
When he had finished, he hugged her tightly and told her he was going to get some sleep. She nodded and stared silently at the floor.<br>
<br>
Sleep found the warrior easier that night than it had in countless nights before, and mercifully, it was the deep and dreamless sleep of one too far gone to feel.<br>
<br>
Birds were chirping and it was well into the morning when Uhrlik finally awoke. Lamila was making up a plate of breakfast for him and smiled weakly when she saw his eyes open. There was a determination in her eyes, then. A fixation stronger than he had seen since their wedding. <br>
<br>
He opened his mouth to question her, but she shoved the plate of food at him and said in a tone that brooked no argument, “I have someplace to take you, so eat up and get ready. There’s someone that you need to meet.”<br>
<br>
So he did as he was told. He ate mechanically, cleaned mechanically and dressed mechanically. He was anxious to meet someone that Lamila thought might be able to help him.<br>
<br>
A knock at the door preceded the entrance of Lamila’s younger brother, Webberran. He was fully armed and armored, and there was excitement dancing in his eyes. “You two ready to get going?”<br>
<br>
“Almost.” Lamila said from another room. “Make yourself a cup of tea, we’ll be ready in a few minutes.”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik strapped his armor on and went to chat with Web. A few minutes later, Lamila strode from the bedroom in her travel gear. She was ready to travel through potentially hostile territory, it seemed.<br>
<br>
She stood between them and began twisting her energies. When the wind subsided, Uhrlik found himself standing in a small, blackened stone ring with a carved dragon above his head.<br>
<br>
“This is familiar.” Uhrlik stated blandly.<br>
<br>
Lamila nodded, “The Wakening Lands. Where the Mother of All has focused her energy to revive this frigid, desolate continent. Web, lead on.”<br>
<br>
Webberran hopped to a running start and dashed off into the wilds of the tangled growth of life that the Wakening Lands had become. Shortly after, a small lake came into view, with an island in the center of it. A wide stone bridge crossed the watery expanse, leading to a tall stone tower on the island.<br>
<br>
The three climbed the steps inside the tower, Uhrlik carefully judging the folk of Tunare that inhabited it. Atop the tower was a large bud, like a tree waiting to be born. It vibrated with life, instilling peace in those that came near. Lamila sighed and smiled, laying her hands on the bud. The feeling unsettled Uhrlik, but he laid his hand on it anyway.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, he found himself in a vast grassy plain. Exotic flower petals floated on a light breeze, carrying a feeling of peace and calm. All manner of fair folk roamed the fields, the unicorns occasionally pausing to stare quizzically at him.<br>
<br>
Lamila and Web wandered the pastures, thoughtlessly abandoning their cares, while Uhrlik was thoroughly uncomfortable. He had never known peace in his life and feeling it in the wake of Anna’s demise was as inappropriate as it was unwanted.<br>
<br>
“Why are we here?” He asked a bit more harshly than he had intended.<br>
<br>
“To see the Mother.” Lamila answered. She turned to her brother, “Any sign yet?”<br>
<br>
Web nodded, “I think I know where she is.”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik stared at Lamila dubiously.<br>
<br>
“What?” She asked. “You met the god of one of your parents, now it’s time to meet the other. I think it’s important for you to know where you came from.”<br>
<br>
The warrior just shook his head and followed after them.<br>
<br>
They strode through the grasslands to the base of Tunare’s tree. Steps wound up the side, fading into the clouds far above. Lamila was nearly giddy with excitement.<br>
<br>
Far up the tree, Uhrlik saw what appeared to be a doorway cut into the massive tree. Inside, stood the Mother of All, Tunare.<br>
<br>
Taller than a High Elf, her gleaming golden hair was fastened back into a long ponytail. A magnificent golden crown encircled her brow, the delicate trees and plants worked into it seemed on the point of blowing in the breeze. She wore a blue dress that fell about her in waves. In her hand she clasped a tall golden staff with immense power radiating from it. She stood with the staff in hand and her eyes closed as if sleeping.<br>
<br>
Lamila and Webberran immediately fell to one knee in reverence. Uhrlik…waved hello to the goddess.<br>
<br>
Tunare’s eyes shot open and she spoke in a voice that reminded Uhrlik of a symbol of love and devotion, his mother, and it took his breath away. “Greetings my daughter and my son. And even you are my son, Uhrlik. I have not given up on you.”<br>
<br>
“What am I to do now?” He asked and his wife gasped at his abruptness.<br>
<br>
Tunare looked at him sadly, “Do you hate the Dark Prince?”<br>
<br>
“I do now.” He sighed, “I don’t know what I’m doing here.” Turning to leave, he heard Tunare calling over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Then where is the rage? Where in your heart is the hate that he planted at your birth? The hate that he fostered when his agents stole your parents and your childhood. I feel none of that from you.”<br>
<br>
Uhrlik felt within himself for the hate, the rage that had simmered in his veins his whole life, but could find no trace of it. “I do not know.”<br>
<br>
“Perhaps in your understanding of Hate, you have found that you do not need it any more. Hate has no power over an awakened mind.” The goddess proposed.<br>
<br>
“Who was she?” Uhrlik inquired with a tear in his eye.<br>
<br>
“Annastrianna Starflower, a rare daughter indeed. I truly wished I could have sheltered her.” She said, her voice laden with pain.<br>
<br>
“Why didn’t you protect her then?” The warrior raged.<br>
<br>
“Don’t question her like that!” Lamila protested while Web glared dangerously shouting “You have no right!”<br>
<br>
“I have every right!” He demanded then waved a dismissive hand at them and turned to leave again. “I will find no answers here.”<br>
<br>
“Find the song, Uhrlik.” Tunare whispered with the divine patience of a mother. “The song holds all of the answers you seek.”<br>
<br>
He stopped and felt deep within himself. There he was as a child, his mother singing him to sleep as he cried. Her song had comforted him ever since. It had been the only thing to stand against the hate until he found Lamila. The words came back to him and the melody washed over him like a tidal wave.<br>
<br>
Faster and more forceful the words came, they began to take on new feelings, the peace changing to honor changing to glory. The comfort changing to direction changing to purpose.<br>
<br>
Uhrlik turned to face a blinding radiance. Tunare glowed like a sun as she stood with a massive blue lacquered shield in her left hand, resting on the floor, and two long tipped spears held majestically in her right. She wore a heavy blue breastplate and thick leather skirts. On her head was a blue helm with flowing white wings on the sides. <br>
<br>
Her voice boomed in the cathedral carved into the tree as she sang his mother’s song. In her voice, the song turned from the comforting song of his childhood to a song of war. It filled him to bursting with the feeling of glory. He felt his own honor and purpose coming to life in every corner of his soul.<br>
<br>
“The song that Uhrsalla sang to you as a child was the battle song of Takish-Hiz. I taught it to her when she came to see me, when she was pregnant with you.” Tunare spoke in his mind, “Take this song and find your glory, do the justice you were meant to do.”<br>
<br>
“What justice?”<br>
<br>
“You said it yourself, your faith is in steel. You owe partiality to no one. You are one born to justice. The rage in your heart is an inferno of conviction. The prayers of the weak, the screams of the dead and the cries of the ones left behind fuel the conflagration pulsing in your veins. You are a Dark Justice, a spirit of vengeance. You protect what must be protected and avenge what must be avenged.” The Mother added the last with an obvious weight in her voice, a tinge of barely restrained fury.<br>
<br>
“Then I am made for revenge.” It was not quite a question, but Tunare’s stony silence was answer enough.<br>
<br>
“When Lamila, the Heart of your Heart is with child, return to me, Dark Justice Uhrlik, and remember always that though you have no faith in gods, I have faith in you.”<br>
<br>
Then as quickly as it had begun, the song faded. Tunare stood as she had before, her eyes closed in meditation. Lamila and her brother stood at the doorway, ready to leave.<br>
<br>
“Uhrlik!” His wife shouted with a giggle. “Are you coming or not?”<br>
<br>
Shaking himself back to the moment and rushing back to his companions, Uhrlik hugged his wife tightly. “Thank you, Heart. I’m ready now.” <br>

Pain Remembers<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The earth of Eastern Karana was drenched with the black stinking blood of the Teir’Dal. Their leader was a being so foul he oozed a corrupt and cancerous ichor from his wounds. It bubbled and foamed as it seeped from his body. Even after a bath and a thorough scrubbing of his armor, Uhrlik doubted that he would ever be free from the oily reek. He would never be washed clean, much like the land. Nothing new would ever grow where the wretched Dark Elf fell.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After the fight with the Teir’Dal, the combined forces left the Plains of Karana. The feast was joined at the castle of Lore where the Knights welcomed their new friends the Feir’Dal and honored them with stories and food. The ale flowed freely and dishes from every corner of Norrath were served. The banquet lasted long into the night, most staggering upstairs to their appointed quarters, others choosing to sleep where their heads lay.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eventually only the four at the lead table remained: the druids Nytte and Lamila and the warriors Iianae and Uhrlik. They spoke long and low about past adventures, about places they’d seen and people they’d met. Uhrlik felt a kinship with these two newfound friends, and before long he found that he was telling his own sordid history.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His telling was cold and dispassionate, but his eyes blazed with a bitterness and fury that belied his detached exterior. The warrior noticed that he rolled Anna’s ring through his fingers as he told his tale, and he shoved it firmly in his pouch and grasped his goblet with both hands.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Iianae followed him with her own story, her brow furrowed in disquieting symmetry. “I remember the orc war.” She started. Staring deep into her wine as if seeing it all again in some torturous mirror she continued, “My father, Iian, was guarding one of the lifts when the orcs attacked. I did everything I could to cut a path through to him, but I wasn’t strong enough. I just couldn’t get there fast enough.” Her voice dropped to nearly a whisper, “I lost him that night.” She drained her cup and pushed it away. Clearing her throat she looked deep in Uhrlik and Lamila’s eyes in turn. “I had no one after that, except for Master Regren.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik nodded into his own cup, remembering stalwart Master Regren, the head of the Emerald Warriors in Kelethin.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What about your mother?” Lamila asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The warrioress turned a pained glance toward her, “My mother was taken by the orcs and made a slave. She…didn’t survive.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lamila gasped, “I’m so sorry.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Iianae shook her head, waving off the apology, “I don’t remember much of her, except that she used to sing a lot.” She smiled as she searched for a melody in her head.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik sighed heavily, “So many innocent people taken, so many forced to work to death.” He clenched his jaw tight for a moment and then spoke aloud almost to himself, “No, you can’t help them all. That’s a fight that we’ve all left to the next generation.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly the warrior’s head shot up, his eyes wide. He stared in utter disbelief across the table at Iianae. The unexpected movement shocked her to silence. Lamila and Nytte shifted their eyes between the two, unsure of what was wrong.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What was that you were just singing?” Uhrlik asked rather insistently.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The song that my mother used to sing to me, why?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Keep going. Sing on, please.” He urged.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The warrioress closed her eyes and a tiny smile crept across her lips. She began to sing softly, her voice rising slowly. A melody unlike any other echoed softly in the great hall. Clearly elven, the sound caressed the soul, comforting all but the most insidious hurts. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The mood of the lullaby changed abruptly as Uhrlik joined his own voice to it. It grew somehow. The bedtime tune became a symphony of emotion. It was dirge and lullaby all at the same time. It was glorious and simple, majestic and personal. Before this moment, each of the vocalists had gaps in their memories where the melody eluded them, but all gaps were filled in the presence of the other half of the song.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Something clicked in Uhrlik’s mind as the song ended, something his father had told him when he was little. His mother had lost her older sister to the orcish slave pens. His mother had never spoken much of her, preferring to keep the pain to herself. When she spoke of her childhood, however, she told how she and her sister would wander through the woods and sing. “She had such a glorious voice,” she would say. “Always singing, and so beautifully that Tunare herself could have cried.” Furtively, he shared the memory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So that would make us…cousins.” Iianae tumbled the word clumsily in her mouth, trying to get used to the feel of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lamila grasped Uhrlik’s hand underneath the table with one hand and wiped away her joyful tears with the other. She could feel how much it meant for Uhrlik to have family, real blood family, in the world.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The warrioress turned swiftly to face Nytte. “You know something more, don’t you?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nytte said nothing, merely refilling his cup and shuffling his plate to the side.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Out with it, hon.” She urged. “We’ve known each other for too long for you to feel that you can’t tell me something.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He nodded and squeezed her hand lightly, “I know.” Though years never touched the elves it seemed that the fine lines around Nytte’s wizened eyes deepened with the effort of finding the words to a long buried memory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At length he began, “I too remember the orc war. I remember where it started, in the ignorance and complacency of the Council of Elder Druids.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “It started years before that horrible night. I was walking home late one night and I felt something…odd in the air. It was like a greasy slick crossed over my mind.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Dvinn.” Uhrlik snarled.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nytte nodded. “I found out that the Dark Elves had sent their Ambassador to ally themselves with the Crushbone orcs, but I could not find out why. The minds of the Teir’Dal are a maze of traps and pitfalls even to themselves.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Being newly raised to the Council I waited with my petitions until they would hear me, but when they did, they scoffed at me. None of them had felt that shadow across their soul like I had. Even when presented with interrogation reports and testimonials of freed slaves they would not budge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So, after that warning I began to conduct my business in secret. I organized watches of druids and teams of rangers to scout the forest. Runners were set up in the cities of Faydwer to deliver messages and sound the alarm if an attack came.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nytte lowered his head and spoke heavily, “Never had I dreamed the orcs would attack with such precision and force. That was my mistake. They came down from the hill and flanked the lift guards, swarming over them with sheer numbers. The watch sounded the alarm and the messengers ran. The druids began doing what they could to stem the tide of orcs, but there were so many and so well disciplined.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I watched as the platform guards leaped from the city into the midst of the blue wave and set to the slaughter. In the press of bodies and the stench of death I saw from my perch atop the city a single young woman, “ he looked deeply into Iianae’s eyes. “I made the decision that no matter what, this lady would survive the fight.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It almost seemed like Nytte’s eyes glassed over to match the tear rolling down Iianae’s cheek. He seemed to realize that he had been holding her hand the whole time and gave it another gentle squeeze.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The next day we recovered the bodies of the fallen, including the rangers that I had sent to guard the woods. Their bodies were bloated with the poison from Dvinn’s black blade. The pyres were lit at sundown and raged on until morning. So many children were left with one or no parents at all. So many children sitting vigil with the fire that was once a loved one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “By morning, most of the children had gone. Their guardians claimed them when physical and emotional exhaustion forced shut their eyelids. I watched over the grieving ones that remained, standing vigil with them and feeling their anguish as my own.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His eyes shifted from one to the next as he impressed his words on them, “I stood there, at a crossroads of my life, thinking. I stood for three days as two mourners sat nearly back to back and watched the ashes of their fathers drift away on the wind.” He looked to Uhrlik, “A young half elf boy with a short sword across his knees, burning with a dreadful vengeance,” The druid turned his eyes to Iianae, “and a graceful wood elven lady. Her mismatched armor was smeared with grime and soot and unheeded tears made tracks of clean across her smudged cheeks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “At last I came to a decision. I felt a burning in my veins. An itching inside my head that could not be contained. So I marched to the Council chambers, interrupting a meeting of the Eldest. They were not happy to see me, but I berated them just the same. If they had listened to me years before that night could have been avoided. I resigned my position on the Council and stormed from their presence with a lighter heart.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The burning in your veins you spoke of,” Lamila began, “The Wanderlust was in you, wasn’t it?”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nytte nodded quickly, “Indeed it was. I spent years roaming across Norrath. But I believe that if that battle hadn’t occurred I would still be on the Council. It was my vigil with the mourners that awoke it in me. However dire the cost, I think that if I had not left, my dear friend Iianae and I might not have met up again, which is something that I’m rather grateful for.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uhrlik cast a sidelong glance at Lamila, “Now I suppose you’ll tell me that you were there, too, in secret.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lamila laughed, “No, I missed that battle. I was exploring the ruined cities of Kunark when the orcs attacked.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So the night wore on and the sun came up and the four talked as old friends renewing acquaintances…<br>
