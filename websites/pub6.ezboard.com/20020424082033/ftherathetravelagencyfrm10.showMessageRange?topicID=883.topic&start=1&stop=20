My reply there also involves the Trak rotation which I DO think is past its usefullness now.  They are seperate though as she says.  I feel having Sev on a similar rotation would be good for the server though.  If you agree please reply here.<br>
<br>
My reply on other thread......<br>
<br>
IMO Trak should be taken off of a rotation, and Sev should be put on.<br>
<br>
Trak is a pain in the ass to even get to and the guilds that are on the rotation can all and do fight in ToV anyways. The reason for the Trak rotation was for VP keys, but is this really still a problem? We (VoF) killed Trak once and never have since. The reason why is because of the rotation we never were able to be up for Trak on a weekend when our forces are strong, and every weekday we were up we didn't have a good turnout. I would guess that in a month or two VoF will be capable of killing Trak any day of the week but we aren't there yet. So my question is...Should Trak be on a rotation anymore?<br>
<br>
The guilds that CAN kill him on weekdays with no problem at all can easily rush to him if he pops and kill him for his teeth. The guilds that can't necessarily kill him any day yet could go for him Fridays thru Sundays. There are probably half a dozen guilds out there that COULD kill Trak but never get the chance because they need a weekend raid to do so. I think it would benefit larger and smaller guilds to take him off rotation.<br>
<br>
Severilous is different IMO. First of all I think that as a server we should agree that if you don't have a warrior waiting for a green scale, then you don't kill Sev. Having killed Trak with my guild, I know we are more than capable of killing Sev. Of course we have never gotten the chance since he is always killed right after he spawns. Currently on the Rathe there aren't a whole lot of guilds that even have ANY warrior epics. The only reason that is the case is because the top handful of guilds are the only guilds strong enough to kill Sev quickly. There are enough guilds like this though that it won't matter when he spawns, at least one guild online at the time can kill him. These guilds that are killing Sev like this DO have warriors that need their epics, so I wouldn't fault them for killing Sev to complete the quests. Unfortunately there are MANY guilds out there that have NO warrior epics at all just because they aren't powerful enough to beat the big guilds to him.<br>
<br>
If Sev was on a rotation then those bigger guilds would STILL be able to get the warriors without epics their green scales. It would also allow the smaller guilds to get their FIRST warrior epics. Granted there are lots of guilds capable of killing Sev so the rotation might be long...but wouldn't it be fair? Let's just say there are a dozen guilds that would want on the rotation and are capable of killing Sev...with his spawntime and the extra time he would be up each time he spawned til the guild up for him kills him...I would guess each guild would get a shot every couple months. This may seem too long to wait for the bigger guilds but isn't it more fair than the way it is now? Should every smaller guild be forced to wait until the bigger guilds have every warrior with their epic until they get their first?<br>
<br>
Of course you would have the same problem with Sev as now with Trak. Guilds that CAN kill him but maybe only on a weekend. I would suggest changing the way the rotation works for this. Instead of having a guild lose its turn when they pass...why couldn't they just say they pass until the next time he is up on a weekend? This would take minimal effort in organization IMO. You would just have a list of guilds and if one passed til a weekend then just move the next guild capable of killing him on a weekday up to that guilds spot (in doing this moving the whole rotation down one slot...well...not the whole rotation just the guilds in between the one passing and the one taking over their spot).<br>
<br>
I really think something like this would be good for The Rathe as a whole and by far would be more fair than how it is now.<br>

I'm not saying they can't be, I'm just saying that it is usually much more efficient to do it the way we've done it in the past.  First, rotations are agreements between guilds, not agreements across the server (at least, rotations are usually a small number of guilds, say 5, where the calender, for instance, is 40).  What I would do if I were you is to find out all the guilds who want to, and still, kill Severilous.  This post is a good way to get that information.  After you get that list, then invite one or more officer/leader from each guild to sit in some out of the way where you won't get spammed with /ooc, /auction, or /shout and sit down and discuss a rotation.  Once you have an agreement, post back on the board saying there is a rotation on Severilous now and the list of guilds participating, along with guidelines on how a new guild can join into the rotation (who to contact, etc).  Good luck with it.<br>
<br>
PS:  Personally, I have no problem with any mob being on a rotation as long as the eligible participants are all consulted and notified.  If Severilous is a bottleneck for something (in this case warrior epics), then I think it is a good candidate for a rotation. <p><P>

<br>
Sev on the other hand is random, 1-3 day spawn, I have seen him spawn twice in a 24 hour period, I seen him go almost to the 4th day before spawning.<br>
<br>
Certain mobs just cant be on rotation because there is no viable way to coordinate communication between guild when he pops, or will pop.<br>
Not to mention his relatively short spawn time allows for many guilds to have a crack at him about 2-3 times a week on average.<br>
Unlike CT, the planes, Trak, and what ever other rotations are currently in effect or being talked about they have down to the minute (practically) spawn times wich allows your guild to &quot;plan&quot; for mob X, with sev he could pop at any time, with no one there to tell you he was up.<br>
<br>
If you really want a rotation I am sure some guilds will be glad to try but after a short time it will become frustrateing when you have X planned on Z day and Sev decided to pop unexpectadly and you have to drop X to do Sev.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp why there hasnt been a rotation and probably wont ever be one. <p><p><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left">Vincecross Dhark'baen 57 Necromancer <br>Vincecrs Dhark'baen 51 Warrior<br>

<br>
Simple : sev pop, anyone that see it give a tell to the guild that is up. if they dont want to do it, cause they are on a raid or anything, they just pass. We dont need a board to say &quot;wednesday tindi will have to kill sev&quot;. We just need the board to see the order of guilds in the rotation, and give tells to that guild ingame. I really think it wouldnt be a prob to put him on a rotation.<br>
<br>
the only &quot;bad&quot; effect of that, is that maybe sev will be up few more hours than now.<br>
<br>
I really think it would be good for little guilds that can have a shoot at him only at certain ours of the day when all the members are up, contrary to bigger guilds that can take him when they want. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubogarthamule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bogarthamule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/16/01 5:35:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=883.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We want Sev on rotation...</span><hr size=1> Just thought of something after reading these replies.<br>
<br>
There are guilds out there that wouldn't want or need a Sev rotation.  As Fitten said though, if there were guilds out there that would be willing to cooperate then maybe we could work something out.<br>
<br>
Idea:<br>
<br>
Just for an example let's say there are 6 guilds that were interested in this...these 6 guilds would have to have the potential of killing Sev on their own IE guilds that had no chance of killing him wouldn't be fair to let in on this.  These 6 guilds form a somewhat &quot;Sev Alliance.&quot;  These guilds then check on Sev often throughout the day and night.  If he is up then every guild in the &quot;alliance&quot; sends all the help they can right away to kill Sev.  From there a rotation could be setup from which guild gets the loot.  Then the next time he pops each guild does the same, and then the next guild gets the loot.  So on and so on.<br>
<br>
This was just a thought that came to mind when reading the replies here.  I'm not sure if this is the most fair or best way of going about it.  If it DOES sound plausable and your guild would be interested in something like this, please give your opinion (again we would have to figure out what is fair in that the guilds should be able to take Sev but maybe just cant at any time of the day).  I could see something like this working with just 2-4 guilds' support but obviously not limited to that since all guilds should get the chance at green scales...so anyone interested? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uslitzjawbreaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Slitz Jawbreaker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Raging Fury</span><br>  Posts: 162<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/16/01 6:46:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=883.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We want Sev on rotation...</span><hr size=1> Hmm, isn't that information a little wrong Vincecross?<br>

The guilds interested in him would list their intentions somewhere (here).<br>

It would require more 'honor' in the honor system.<br>

You kill, you post, you see him again, you /t whoever's next.<br>

But unlike Trakanon Sev is not nearly as dependable. I have NEVER seen Trak spawn within 12 hours of death as i did Sev.<br>
<br>
I can tell you now NB as a guild would most likely(I am not a rep for NB this is just a feeling) would be for a rotate on him, as they do need green scales and have only had the chance to kill him 2 times in about 5 months or so.<br>
<br>
But the problem comes when the guilds who have the advantage of getting to him first, will they want to give up there every chance they get kill to just 1-3 times a month on a shared rotate? <p><p><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left">Vincecross Dhark'baen 57 Necromancer <br>Vincecrs Dhark'baen 51 Warrior<br>

On the other hand if a guild really did want green scales and got off the rotation then they would have to compete alone against the combined power of several other guilds (this is using the idea in my reply to this post).<br>
<br>
Honestly I can't see why a pure rotation like with Trak wouldn't work.  Yes it is random and may spawn when a guild is on a raid, but wouldn't most guilds give up a raid to get a warrior their epic?  I know for VoF, we would stop any raid, even ToV (which is not an easy raid for our guild) to get a green scale.<br>
<br>
As Emil said a rotation on Sev would require a lot of honor in it.  I'm sure there are always people from most guilds checking on him daily, so I doubt a guild could ever kill him without everyone else finding out.  If a guild killed him that isn't on the rotation then not much could be done.<br>
<br>
I still think it might be worth considering people willing to try out a rotation always try to provide help to other guilds on it.  I think of Sev a lot like Ragefire.  The randomness of the spawn really makes it a pain.  I for one have personally seen SoT and NB (I'm sure there are many others) help other guilds with RF when it pops at a bad time.  VoF has helped others with RF before and we've also been helped.  The reason people are so helpful I think with RF is because of the grueling camp which usually involves killing gobs of FGs and people actually camping the lair for hours and hours and hours.  I wouldn't think it should be necessary to have a warrior sit in EJ until Sev spawns but wouldn't it be honorable to treat Sev the same way?  With a list of a rotation all guilds would know who was up for Sev next...that guild should then be responsible to keep a good eye out for Sev since they are up next.  If he pops at a bad time for that guild then other guilds would show a lot of class IMO to lend a helpful hand the same way they do with RF.<br>
<br>
If we just treated Sev the way we do RF and helped eachother out, then I think every guild would benefit.<br>
