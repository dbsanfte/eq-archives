<br>
I think you are missing what I said.  I said the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>SPIRIT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the rotation system.  Since most people seem to be missing what that means let's use a few examples.<br>
<br>
BotS currently has a guild for both alts and friends called Baby Spiers.  Hypothetically speaking some of us don't all get along 100% and what not, so we have decided to make a number of smaller guilds.  These smaller guilds will house both alts of certain BotS members plus friends of those members.  The new guilds will be called the following:<br>
-Baby Spiders<br>
-Mini Spider<br>
-Junior Spiders<br>
-Lowbie Spiders<br>
-Teenage Mutant Ninja Spiders<br>
<br>
We will slowly be gearing up our friends in their respective guilds and would like 5 rotations on all mobs that they can kill.  We anicipate this to include but not be limited to the following:  Trak, AoW, KT, Sev, Greig, Dozekar, Cazic Thule, Zlandicar and Klandicar.  We anticipate them entering these rotations within the next cycle.<br>
<br>
See how ludicrous this becomes?  This violates the SPIRIT of the rotation system.  Although by the letter of the law it would not be violating the RTA rules, that does not make it any more valid.  That is the point here that I think most people are continually missing.  The point is you want to pick and choose when and where you start teaming up on boss mob encounters.  No one ever said you &quot;CAN'T&quot; team.  What they did say was fine team, but merge ALL you rotations when you decide to start teaming.  <br>
<br>
All this talk about holding people down is nothing more than wanting your cake and eating it too.  We want to get as much loot as we can, as many keys as we can, as many flags as we can for our guild no matter how we do it.  You talk about the greed of uber guilds wanting to hold mid to lower tier guilds down?  I argue the it is those same guilds wanting to ask guilds who on a whim could easily gank such targets to not do so.  Then on the other hand try to get into as much of that loot, keys flags as they can for themselves.  Perhpas here is a good illustration:<br>
<br>
Meduim Guild:<br>
They are a guild of about 50 hard core players who often have around 40 online at peak hours.<br>
<br>
They kill 3 mobs<br>
mob_A - this takes them about half their hardcore members to kill, they often have done it with as few as 4 groups or about 22 people.  They often know when he is up and could kill him pretty much upon respawn if they so choose to.  He has 2 decent loot drops that is currenlty working it's way through their lower ranks.<br>
mob_B - this takes them about 2/3 their hardcore members to kill, they often have done it with as few as 5 full groups or 30 people.  They usually know when he is up and could kill him pretty much upon a few hours of respawn if they so choose to.  He has 2 above average loots that are currently going to upper level and mid rank members.<br>
mob_C - This takes them all of their all to do.  He is an uber mob and has great loot, but they need 45+ people to turn out or they just can't do it.  They are fortunate to be able to kill this mob.  He drops excellent loot and only their top ranks are seeing it at this time.<br>
<br>
Small Medium Guild_01 (SMG1)<br>
They are a guild of about 30 hard core players.  Who often have around 25 members on at peak hours.  When raids are scheduled almsot all their hard core members are there as well as some of their more casual players.  Full raid force usually consists of about 40 at max.<br>
<br>
They Kill 2 mobs:<br>
mob_A. - This mob they have down pat now.  It used to take them all they could get online, but after a few times they really have a good strategy down.  They have often done it with as few as 25 at the raid.  They usually plan for this event and let all their members know when the upcoming spawn is to ensure that they have the numbers they need to kill him.  Currently loot is going to the top and mid level ranks in the guild.<br>
mob_B - This mob they are very fortunate to be able to kill.  Medium Guild above gave them a shot at it a few months ago.  They had all their hard core members on and most of their casual members.  They had a bulk raid force of 45 players for this raid and are in the rotation for it.  Currently all loot is goign to top end ranks in the guild only.<br>
mob_C - Well they have tried this mob a few times, but right now it is beyond them to able to do it because of numbers, levels and gear, but they hope to be able to kill him one day.<br>
<br>
Small Medium Guild_02 (SMG2)<br>
They are nearly identical to Small Medium Guild_01.  They are on the same rotations, and have the same aspirations of killing mob_C.  They also however suffer the same logistcal problems that they have serious difficulties dropping mob_B unless all their members know when he is spawning and they have all their hard core members there plus a good many of their more casual players there to ensure success.<br>
<br>
Small Medium Guild ( 01 and 02) decide to team up on mob_C and share the loot between them since they can't take him on alone yet, they know combined they could do it.  They decide to kill him as one entity for only mob_C and ask to remain seperate rotations on mobs A &amp; B.<br>
<br>
Please tell me you now don't see the hypocrisy of this?  The larger guild in theis scenario could easily be ganking mob_A everytime it spawned, and mob_B within a few hours of spawning.  HOWEVER they graciously decide to put their greedy ways aside and let BOTH Small Medium Guilds have a fair equal unhindered shot at those mobs.  The understanding is that these guilds won't abuse that goodwill.  Herein lies the abuse.  SMG 01 and 02 now want a rotation on mob_C, but seperate rotations on mobs A &amp; B.<br>
<br>
Honestly I can't see how this strikes anyone as fair, and I tihnk most would agree it is not fair.  Per rotation cycle they are getting 2 lower level loots, 2 medium type loots and 2 uber type loots.  They still have plenty of members who could use alot more of those 2 lower level and medium type loots.<br>
<br>
Here is the reason it is not fair:<br>
Quite frankly they would like to perma farm mob_A for about 2 or 3 months and be done with him.  However since they are fairly rotating this mob it will take them around 6-9 months to finish up with Mob_A and possibly 1-2 years to finish up with mob_B.  At the same time they are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>delaying their own progress</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, you are now asking them to further delay it to cater to both SMG's?  If both SMG's want to ally that is A-O-K, so long as they now merge their alliance on both mobs_A&amp;B as well.  In that way, although the larger guild is now also slowed down in their progression through mob C, at least they have speeded up their progression on mobs A &amp; B.<br>
<br>
Therein lies the *SPIRIT* of the system.  Larger guilds delay their progress on certain mobs so that all have a fair shot at it.  The *SPIRIT* is about progression.<br>
<br>
I would like to ask how far do you think teaming up on progression would be logical and fair?<br>

<br>
Well, honestly, if you *can* xp grind in the elemental planes, and the mobs that flag you for those are not on rotation, nor justify a rotation by demand or loot, and there is an alternative quest that allows access to those zones, then I say 'why not?'<br>
<br>
We're not after loot from the mob we killed, just like was discussed. On a risk vs reward scale, Aerin Dar won't be something that we push for a rotation on. Our primary motivation for going to HoH is not loot, I believe you misunderstood my statement; Xedd made the claim that loot is easy to get there, I used that to suggest that it was not primarily a raiding zone.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That right there is what the heart of the issue is all about.  Everyone wants to draw the line at different places.  Some say AD, some think the Elemental planes.  So then what?  You team on all boss mobs up to Rallos Zek (RZ) because you are only &quot;after xp&quot;, to get past RZ to &quot;xp&quot; in the elemental planes and find that some min's there are actually not quite as hard as RZ.  Then some guilds decide hey our guild can kill said mini boss on our own, we want to rotate this mob and kill it on a regular basis.  I call foul!  The means by which you even accessed the content was one of teaming, however now you want 2 rotations on Blizzak because he is eaiser for you to do than RZ?  These guilds then start looking to the 3 other elemental planes as well?  <br>
<br>
Where should you draw the line to prevent it BEFORE it gets to this stage?  At the start of the whole road is the best place to raise such objections, rather than when faced with this exact scenario.  On other servers they have raids of 400 people to kill RZ.  There was a reason sony implemented the 72 flag rule.  I would much rather, and I am sure if you were honest you would to, that objections are raised at the start of this issue rather than half way through.  If not I can hear it already..... &quot;Well you didn't say anything when we killed AD so what is the big deal now?&quot;<br>
<br>
If no one believes in the *SPIRIT* of the rotations, IE only the letter of the law should apply, I am certain you will have no problems with members from BotS, Tindi, NB, etc... ganking 2 and 3 sxpansion old content on a whim.  They will hang their heads and take the shame of the community and skip this rot and the next rot as due punishment, for rots that they are not even on.  See the letter of the law is followed here as well, however I am sure it just doesn't seem fair when the shoe is on the other foot. <p>Soneya<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

If it were only the 3 mobs that could be quested past, I would be willing to agree with you.  However, if the big guilds agree to this today, what stops the smaller guilds from coming back in 3 months time and bitching about how the big guilds are opressing them by not allowing them to team up on the next level mob?<br>
<br>
If however, we can agree on a rule at this time that states only these three mobs, that have alternative quests, can ever be teamed up on then we might be able to come to an agreement. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emilsinclair>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GL-BoTS</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/16/03 7:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=278>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> if it can be quested, then why not just do the quest? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/view.php?Emil" target="top">Emil Sinclair</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, 65th Monk<br>

h) following current alliance policy, any break up of an alliance will result in the alliance being removed from the rotation, and each guild must each kill the mob separately to be placed back on the rotation.<br>

This could be done, however, requesting for a mob you dont kill to be on rotation is probably as close as you can can come to cockblocking without being obvious.  I challenge anybody to argue about the 'spirit of the RTA' and entertain this ridiculous suggestion.  The RTA has no right to dictate how we kill mobs.  The RTA was established to make sure that everybody gets equal access to content.  Putting rules on mobs whose content is not contested is just a way to manipulate the system unfairly in order to monopolize the content you already have.  <br>
<br>
On a different topic, I would like place Trakanon Teeth on the calender so that we can regulate access to seb keys.  Theres just too many people in this zone and its really starting to comprimise my capacity to get groups/loot.  Thank you for your time I hope my ridiculous suggestion will help you see how totally absured yours is. <br>

Main Entry: 1com·pro·mise <br>
Pronunciation: 'käm-pr&amp;-&quot;mIz<br>
Function: noun<br>
1 a : settlement of differences by arbitration or by consent reached by mutual concessions b : something intermediate between or blending qualities of two different things<br>
<br>
I'm using defintion (a) <br>
<br>
The above 'compromise' is not a compromise at all. It is a rationalization.  For it to be a compromise, both parties (those capable of killing solo, and those incapable of killing solo) would have to 'give' a little.<br>
<br>
For instance, a compromise would be:<br>
<br>
If you wish to team up to kill a pop flagging mob, you and your team become an RTA recognized alliance for (determine a fair and fitting time duration) month(s) for every pop flag mob you kill.<br>
<br>
Example:  Guild X, on 5 pre-pop rotations, Guild Y on 4 pre-pop rotations.  They merge to kill AD 2x, Behe 2x and Grummus 2x.<br>
<br>
The two guilds are now recognized as a single unity for 1 month (pretend that's the agreed penalty) per kill of a flag mob (in this case for 6 months they would be considered an alliance).<br>
<br>
Guild X and Y now merge together on thier 5 pre-pop rotations for 6 months, assuming they do not continue to team up on various flag encounters - they would then return back to two separate RTA recognized entities.<br>
<br>
This would be a compromise. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/view.php?Emil" target="top">Emil Sinclair</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, 65th Monk<br>

<br>
You speak of undermining the &quot;spirit of the Rathe&quot; and say that breaking as of yet unwritten rules is somehow gonna ruin this fantabulous system that in all your grace and generosity you have put in place to give us little guys a chance too.  Well if this system allows you to go around &quot;ganking&quot; mobs that 3-4 of you could take all by yourselves, but you decide to leave them to the bottom feeders it's only because you have found bigger and better things to spend your time going after in the elemental planes.  <br>
<br>
You denegrate any and all who disagree with you.   Seems like thou dost protest too much.  <br>
<br>
If you and those that are in the place to make such decisions feel so strongly, then put AD and the other flag mobs on your philanthropic rotation system, enabling those from guilds with less than 70 members to only be able to reach HoH by doing alternate quest, and ensuring that they go no further in the tier progression.<br>
<br>
This is the decision you must make.  Bottom line is if you do it will eventually be a rule made to be broken.  Many guilds do not wish to recruit just to have zerg force capabilities.  Many guilds have fewer members for good cause.  <br>
<br>
If you like you may make a rule that says if two guilds must team up to take down a mob that is on rotation then they have to share that mob rotation until such time as they can do it solo.  But to declare that teamwork is against the &quot;spirit of the Rathe&quot; is ludicrous at best.  This was not a rotation mob!!!<br>
<br>
Change begets change and so you must now decide how to deal with it.  Make the flag encounters rotation events or shut up about it and stop belittling and condescending to those who are doing what they can to progress in this game.  Most will follow the rules as they are set but left undefined lines will be crossed. <p><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Always Pursuing The Chase</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=455992"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-size:medium;"> PSLEESTAK</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
<br>
This is such a joke.  Not care?? Are you an idiot??<br>
<br>
I think the mid-teir and lower-tier guilds have supported the rotation system exceptionally well considering it was made with only the input of a few high-tier people.  We have championed the cause as much as the higher-tier guilds.  Do we kill Rot mobs out of order??<br>
<br>
You are acting like we have been blowing Rot mobs and breaking RTA rules just to spite the high-tier mobs.  This is just false.  We have followed the rotation rules to a T.  So try another angle there Skippy.<br>
<br>
But there also is no rule that we have to follow blindly and agree with everything that the Rathe Council of Superiors has handed down.  The people posting here in support of keeping these Non-Rot mobs know it is within their rights (I can't even believe I have to say this about a video game - This situation is so fucking absurd) to state their desires and requests.<br>
<br>
Sorry if having an opinion means we don't care about the RTA or the Higher-Tier guilds.  That just makes me laugh.  That is your hang up, not ours.  Don't put that weight on our shoulders because we goddam don't deserve it.<br>

I can't believe people like Shogon have the nerve to suggest that we would start breaking rules just because we get to a new zone.  We've followed the rules all this time, why would we start breaking them now.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what makes you think and feel this way, but I assure you that your emotions are unfounded.<br>
<br>
At this point, I am so appauled (sp?) at some of the insane ideas that people have presented that I am not even sure what to think anymore.  I don't think it is possible to have a civil conversation with people who are pretending there is a conspiracy theory here.  Your paranoia of smaller end guilds breaking rotation rules is just as bad as all the whiners that are saying they are being opressed.<br>
<br>
Both sides need to drop the conspiracy theories and wake up.  Then and only then can a COMPROMISE be reached on this issue.  Yes, a compromise, not a mandate, is what needs to occur here to keep our beloved system intact.<br>

<br>
Im a big supporter of the RTA rules.  I also support teamwork in situations where the content is not contested.  On many occasions guilds have teamed up to go kill in chardok for cleric epics, a crucial step in a guilds ability to advance in the game.  Now im not going to go back to archived post to see if a big deal was made when guilds started doing this, but I suspect it was not a big deal then, and it should not be now.<br>
<br>
I see AD/Grummus/Behemoth to be very similar types of encounters to chardok because <br>
<br>
1) They are neccessary in a guilds capacity to progress through the game.<br>
2) No rotation is needed since this content is not contested.<br>
<br>
Does this mean that the guilds who team up now will 'team' up agains the mobs down the road to further their progression?  The difference is that the content further down the line will probably be contested, especially as more guilds make it to that far.  So in the interest of fairness, the smaller guilds would have to respect the rules of the RTA.  They've respected them up till now, why change later?  Now smaller guilds may choose to team up on PoP mobs on rotation down the road, but would do so at the cost of forming an alliance and sharing all rotation content as a single entity.  That would be there right.  Lets make sure that the mobs on rotation deserve to be on rotation and not have all guilds on auto-pass.<br>
<br>
We understand that larger guilds wont break up into smaller pieces to get greater access to weaker rotation content, and the smaller guilds will respect that content on rotation need to be engaged in manner outlined by the regulations put forth by the RTA.  <br>
<br>
But to raise such alarm at a team kill on AD is a bit ridiculous.  Over-reactionalism at its best.<br>

No, you adhere to the absolute letter of the law while completing bankrupting the spirit of it.  No one has teamed on THO, Sont, Vindi, etc all the examples of “no one would say anything IF”, they’re all hypotheticals.  Well wake up, because I’m talking about two dead Aerin Dars, not hypotheticals, and a complete 180 from the way things have been handled on our server for the last three years.  All because of flags for a zone that there is a quest for.  So go do the quest. . .and get your xp.<br>

The last time NB went to do the Chardok royals for new recruits and alts, the Royals were taken.  Same thing with the last time we went to do Aerin Dar.  How do you justify calling it uncontested?<br>
<br>
Let me paint a simple picture for you.  BOTS, NB, Tindi, VOF, SOTE, LoM, FK, ED, CB, VOLS all have members flagged for HoH.  I won’t bother listing the remaining guilds that are NOT flagged for HoH, but let’s settle on a number of 30+.  30+ guilds all after the same mob to get into HoH, and you call it uncontested?!?  By what measure?!<br>

Probably?  First, I don’t like probably, maybe or other words of doubt when it comes to something like this.  Second, to follow Korwynn’s or your advice on “hey, just let this one slide till we get to something you really care about”, is advocating being exactly what we are accused of: narrow self-interest.  It’s the principle of the thing that bothers me, not HoH the zone itself (trials being blown is another matter).  I agree with Gromm and others who have pointed out, that if this precedent is allowed, these same guilds or others that follow will cry foul and point to this example as why they are bein’ oppressed for not being allowed to team Rallos or Mith Marr or HoH trials.  After all, they couldn’t kill Aerin Dar alone, there is no way in hell they’ll be able to do Rydda Dar with less capability than they had for Aerin Dar.

My distinction has been, the entire time, that if there is a quest that allows you to pass the mob, than you should be able to team on the mob. <br>
<br>
THIS IS A BRAND NEW SITUATION (Caps for emphasis, not yelling)<br>
<br>
And as such, brand new rules can and should apply to it. It is also my contention, as a member of a guild that *cannot* kill most of the PoP flagging mobs, that small guilds should not be allowed to team on mobs that *cannot* be quested past. <br>
<br>
The zones beyond drop loot that is 'guarded' by the flagging encounter. Teaming on mobs that cannot be quested past, to me, is like teaming up to kill a rotation mob;<br>
<br>
a. The mob is obviously desired; the fact that it has been left up for days, or weeks, is not an issue to prove or disprove desire. Why would any guild try to kill the mob, let alone get together with another guild, if the mob was not desired. If the mob is desired, it has at least one of the qualities of a rotation mob. <br>
<br>
b. The mob has loot, or a benefit from killing it, that is very valuable. The ability to move to the next zone is very valuable, proven by the fact that two guilds or more would have the interest to come together to kill this one mob. When's the last time two guilds got together to raid in crushbone? The benefit from killing it provides the second quality of a rotation mob.<br>
<br>
c. The mob has a suitably long respawn time. <br>
<br>
That one's easy, so we've proved ALL the PoP flagging mobs have the qualities of a rotation mob, including the ones that you can quest past. So why, as someone who feels that the mobs you can quest past should be an exception to this, why do I offer this proof that even the quest-past mobs are rotation worthy, and in fact, rotation by all but name?<br>
<br>
Because I want people to be sure to understand that any mob you *can't* quest past, should not be teamed on. <br>
<br>
I am asking, not telling. I ask that an exception be made to skip a time sink. I also recognize the validity of saying &quot;no&quot; to that exception, and recognize the validity of a rule that says, flat out &quot;No teaming on flag mobs as well as rotation mobs&quot;. Anyone who doesn't, is being a part of the problem. <br>
<br>
It is in this case, that saying 'but the mob isn't on a rotation' is splitting hairs. The mob <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>may as well be on a rotation</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and because the situation is so unique, it isn't. <br>
<br>
How many AoW's do you think BotS would have killed if he'd dropped 72 loot pieces the first time they killed him? Each time after?<br>
<br>
The point is the same; because there are such high numbers of valuable pieces from these mobs, the only reason they are not on an official rotation is for logistical reasons. <br>
<br>
Let me spell out the absolute nature of my position thusly:<br>
<br>
To those guilds currently killing PoP flagging mobs beyond the three that can be quested past; I believe they should be on rotation, or that convention should treat them as if they are on a rotation, without one being written down. <br>
<br>
Plain and simple, no matter what the outcome of this discussion about mobs that can be quested past, even if every single member of that rotation is on autopass, the flags those mobs drop are so desireable as to be teamed up on if they are not given major distinction. And that, in those circumstances, is the loot they'd otherwise be dropping, and warrents the rule that they must be killed in the same way as any other rotation mob. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>
The only unique situation here, is with three very specific mobs, that can be quested past. <br>
</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
All others that cannot be quested past, are no differant than the Avatar of War, or Tunare, or Lord Seru, or any other high end content of a zone or expansion. <br>
<br>
I suggest that the outcome of this discussion, and following rules, should be based off of people's reactions to this idea; if the majority, or hell, even a minority of people chime in that &quot;no, they want to team on all flagging mobs&quot; than I would like to add my voice to the discussion, again. If the decision is between teaming on all, or teaming on none, than I support teaming on *none*. A compromise is only valid if there is movement on both sides. An absolute view of teaming in either direction, to me, is wrong, but I'd rather be wrong and fair to those who have gone before, than be *just* wrong and fair to no one. <br>
<br>
There is a huge differance between being fair, and being greedy, and I really don't think that greedy should ever win. If the pressure to allow teaming all the way up was bowed to, than the greedy would win. <br>
<br>
Support getting to content without being forced to quest to it? <br>
Sure do.<br>
<br>
Support getting to content that you couldn't get to, any other way, without the detriments of being a formal alliance? Sure don't. <br>
<br>
So yeah, that's me. <br>
<br>
Either <br>
A. NO teaming at all<br>
or <br>
B. Teaming *ONLY* on mobs that can be quested past. <br>
<br>
Anything else is an abuse of the RTA; even this that we ask is an exception to the rules of the RTA, and should be remembered as an exception that is one made *willingly*. <br>
<br>
I'd remind anyone being obnoxious and rude, that not only are you in the general forum, but you are asking for a change, not telling people what to do. Even I know that. <br>

<br>
Doomshade and Rumblecrush are good examples.  They are OBVIOUSLY contested content.  The smaller to mid range guilds race like a mofo to get to them first because of the decent loot they drop.  I can't tell you how many times I have seen 2 or 3 guilds group up to take doomshade down.  Were they a formal alliance?  No.<br>
<br>
There are times when a guild that is our sized might have a bad night, say only 20 people are on, but we need 40 to kill a mob that will benefit us, so we might ask another guild along.  They come and help us so that they can learn how to do something, but we still get the loot and the benefits od the night, while they benefit in knowledge.<br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong with teaming on mobs.  Nothing wrong with teaming on Sontalak, and nothing wrong with teaming on AD.  Unlike other people, I'm not going to sit here and make suppositions about why teaming upsets you so much, but I am going to make the observation that it HAS to be about more that what has been said so far, because just as Gromm doesn't feel that anybody has made an good argument for why teaming is GOOD, I haven't been made to understand why it is BAD.<br>
<br>
We ARE NOT talking about guilds getting more loot, or more shares on rotations than they should.  GET THAT THROUGH YOUR HEADS.  We are talking about two smaller entities helping each other progress into a new zone of the game to exp and get whatever amount of decent loot that zone offers.  We are not talking about running over any rules or barking down people's trees higher up on  the line.<br>
<br>
I think that the people that are the most outspoken and have such a huge problem with teaming are blowing *Their* issue WAY out of preportion in their minds.  We aren't even on the &quot;same page&quot; here.  <br>
<br>
When Milambus said:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If it were only the 3 mobs that could be quested past, I would be willing to agree with you. However, if the big guilds agree to this today, what stops the smaller guilds from coming back in 3 months time and bitching about how the big guilds are opressing them by not allowing them to team up on the next level mob?<br>
<br>
If however, we can agree on a rule at this time that states only these three mobs, that have alternative quests, can ever be teamed up on then we might be able to come to an agreement.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
He was the only person who has even come close to THIS ISSUE.  The rest of you are flying off on tangents and freaking out about things that SHOULD not even be a concern at this point.  <br>
<br>
Lots of people have teamed on Sont, Vindi, and other raid level mobs with semi-contested content, Karadin, so I have no idea what you are even trying to say.  They are NOT hypotheticals.  I have seen such with my own eyes.  You are trying to stray away from the actual issue AGAIN by inserting your spin.  Sorry.<br>
<br>
The issue still remains that AD, Grummus, and Behemoth are then only mobs that we are talking about.  They are not rotation mobs, and as has happened with mobs throughout the expansions, guilds will help each other kill mobs that are too hard for them, as long as they are not rotation mobs.<br>
<br>
Just because you are just now NOTICING that this is happening because the mobs are so much closer to where you are, doesn't make it any different.<br>
<br>
Guilds will continue to follow the rules.<br>

Let me paint a simple picture for you. BOTS, NB, Tindi, VOF, SOTE, LoM, FK, ED, CB, VOLS all have members flagged for HoH. I won’t bother listing the remaining guilds that are NOT flagged for HoH, but let’s settle on a number of 30+. 30+ guilds all after the same mob to get into HoH, and you call it uncontested?!? By what measure?!<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
On the very day that two guilds express a sincere interest in putting AD on rotation, I will consider this mob contested.  When those two guilds are finished with AD (autopass) then its time to take AD off rotation and put him on FCFS.  It just doesnt make sense to regulate how this mob is to be killed when nobody has a (edit:sufficiently) vested interest in killing it.  If these two guilds want to keep farming AD for loot well after there whole guild is flagged, then again, this mob will qualify for rotation.  <br>
<br>
As far as a measuring stick goes, I can find no better.  If your concerned that your guild was not able to kill AD when you wanted to Karadin, then perhaps you should ask for it to be on rotation.  Of course , by the same argument used above, perhaps you should ask that the royals be put on rotation as well.  <br>

If these two mobs are so context, then maybe rotations should be set up for them.  BotS/Tindi/NB are not the only guilds that can agree to rotate mobs.  FK and LoM recently formed the Shie rotation, which none of the &quot;big 3&quot; are on.<br>
<br>
In fact RC almost became a rotational mob in the past, but those intrested at the time agreed to just an informal rotation of not taking 2 kills in a row.<br>
<br>
However, that would be a discussion for anothe thread.<br>

Even NB, a guild of 120+ members, has nights were our peak attendance is 30 people.  Those nights generally turn into small raids (Storms named, Epics, etc) or just exp nights.<br>

<br>
&quot;No, you adhere to the absolute letter of the law while completing bankrupting the spirit of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
God, I am so tired of you spouting your rhetoric of what YOU think the &quot;Spirit of the Rathe&quot; is and that everyone should follow your definition.<br>
<br>
So according to you the &quot;Spirit of the Rathe&quot; means - When two High-Tier guilds kill a mob and then put it on rotation for their own benefit (and yes - It is initially only for your own benefit or you wouldn't put it on rotation to begin with.  You just don't want to race the other guild, or guilds that are also able and wanting to kill said mob), all guilds that want to kill said mob will have to comply with the rules as you have set forth. Any disagreement with these rules apparently is an example of us pagans Bankrupting YOUR &quot;Spirit&quot;.<br>
<br>
That is not my definition of the &quot;Spirit of the Rathe&quot; - That is the &quot;Spirit of the Rathe&quot; as being told to us by high-tier guild members.  What makes you the owners of that?  Because you happen to kill a mob first.  Or are you so much more enlightened than the rest of us that you deem it necessary to divinely proclaim your vision to the rest of us?  Grow up.  And you really shouldn't even use the term &quot;Rathe&quot; when you say that, because it implies that you have the well-being of the server, and thus it's ENTIRE populace, in mind when you make these rules.  You don't.  You should just call it &quot;The Spirit of High-Tiered Guilds&quot;  Because you certainly don't speak for me and I am a member of the &quot;Rathe&quot;<br>
<br>
My definition of the &quot;Spirit of the Rathe&quot; - All rotations, rules, and guidelines must be made and policed with the idea that it benefits the ENTIRE server, it's guilds, and it's individuals.<br>
<br>
You are like an old Spanish Missionary who speaks to the pagan masses of how you hold the secret to enlightenment and all who disagree with you are doomed to an eternity of blasphemy.<br>
<br>
So in future discussion, let's just leave the mystic &quot;Spirit of the Rathe&quot; out of it.  Because your defintion and mine do not compare.<br>

Ah, beautiful, not since college have I seen such obvious breaking of logical fallacies.  Who teamed on Doomshade?  Who teamed on Rumblecrush?  How do they exactly race to kill him the minute he spawns, but yet have these non-formal alliances winning the race?  Every time I have seen either of these die, it has been a race, between two guilds, and being that me and mine run to VT on a fairly regular basis, used to kill him ourselves, and have never seen what you describe, I’m going to need guilds named and more credible witnesses than someone who claims “well, I saw it with my own eyes, many times”.<br>

Yes we are, and if you’d like, you can join the conversation.  Wanna team?  Fine, be an alliance for all your rotations and PoP encounters, or for none.

No, Mil is just trying to come to a compromise.  Please note he has the same concerns many of us do – that these same guilds will use this precedent in the future to selectively team past rotation mobs.<br>

<br>
Who?  What guilds?  When?  I have never seen nor heard of any guild capable of killing Sontalak teaming him.  Same with Vindi, who I can’t believe you qualify as “semi-contested”.  He dies within an hour of spawning.  The ONLY reason Vindi isn’t on rotation is that the rotation system measures kills in days, and Vindi kills would have to be measured with times of day.  No one teams Vindi or Sont because they functionally have one loot.  An ad hoc alliance is not going to put forth the effort required to kill Vindi at the risk of no benefit whatsoever.  An ad hoc alliance wouldn’t continually kill Vindi, because once they did it on a regular basis. . .they are no longer ad hoc are they?<br>

<br>
No, guilds have not helped each other through the various mobs throughout the various expansions, as the vast majority of desireable mobs have been on rotation.  The closest your claim comes to truth is Nagafen or the occasional Vox raid.  The reason for this?  No guild remains at L 52 to chain farm Nagafen and Vox when single group mobs drop better loot at L 60-65.  Nagafen was most heavily teamed by random pickup raids, because he was the only way to get to Ragefire.  Now that Ragefire has moved, you don’t see many Nagafen raids these days.<br>

Jeshter, I think you seriously need to reread Rogg’s post.  One key point he disagrees with you on is that selective teaming is bad and breaks the spirit of the rotation system.<br>
<br>
Since you have trouble finding the portions I will point them out for you:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> There are times when even mobs that are not on rotation, should not be teamed against, ever.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> The zones beyond drop loot that is 'guarded' by the flagging encounter. Teaming on mobs that cannot be quested past, to me, is like teaming up to kill a rotation mob;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> It is in this case, that saying 'but the mob isn't on a rotation' is splitting hairs. The mob may as well be on a rotation and because the situation is so unique, it isn't.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
and finally:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Either <br>
A. NO teaming at all<br>
or <br>
B. Teaming *ONLY* on mobs that can be quested past.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Consistency of argument Jeshter.  Make sure those who you want to say “understands it”, don’t contradict your own claim/argument.<br>

Good post, as always.<br>

A mob doesn’t have to be on rotation to be contested, ask Jeshter.<br>

<br>
I would be willing to entertain discussion along those lines, with provisions agreed upon by all in advance.<br>
<br>
Essentially, to create this compromise both sides would need to be willing to give.<br>
<br>
The 'solo killers' would be relenquishing 3 pop advancement mobs (and consequently the quieter exp areas) by allowing alliances to be used, and then broken immediately after.<br>
<br>
The 'duo killers' would need to agree in advance a rather stringent policy, with a stiff penalty for teaming on mobs other than AD, Behe, Grum.  This would quiet the paranoid folks, to a degree.<br>
<br>
I think it's time to open a new thread, perhaps rogg would like to, and start a formal detailed debate of exactly what each party would like from this, without the right wing and left wing mumbo jumbo.<br>
<br>
By no means am I in charge here -my vote carries no more weight than anyone elses; however, I am beginning to see some points (specifically from rogg) that could be debated in a new thread, and we can see what we see... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/view.php?Emil" target="top">Emil Sinclair</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, 65th Monk<br>

They are those three that you can do a quest to get beyond them. <br>
<br>
If Sontalak was teamed up on, I don't think I'd care, because he really isn't a suitable candidate for a rotation. His loot just isn't good enough for me; sure, we'd get on the rotation for the ST key, but I'd just as soon he wasn't on one. It's easier for guilds that kill him that way. <br>
<br>
I'm asking for an exception based on some very unique set of circumstances. <br>
