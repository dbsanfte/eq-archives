This was right after we had seen the message that hate was coming down and then it came back up. Bantam asked me what time we were starting our raid I simply told him gating up at 10am eastern time and he went eeeps. He then stated the fact of the hate brought down messege and was asking if it was possible to stay over an extra hour. I said that that would interfere with our raid and no that we would not like for you to stay over. I also asked why in the world did they start their raid so late being that they didn't start until around 9 eastern as that is when we were asking about doing a gate up and they said they had just started. I also mentioned that we should also be allowed to have Maestro and Inny. He stated that they were still going after inny and kept apologizing. I NEVER once gave my blessing in fact I was mad and all he kept doing was apologizing. He had told me that they were only going straight for Inny then out. All I kept getting was apologies and i told him I'm not the only one he needs to apologize to we have 4 guilds in the alliance. Gee I wonder if anyone bothered to apologize to them 3 out of the 4 guilds had people still on during the messege and I got tells saying woot we get Inny and come to find out that DBN was just going to take that away. There was no way at all that I &quot;gave my blessing&quot; since I know we can take Inny.<br>
<br>
We get in to Hate with sporatic spawns, some spawns not at all like the cleric house, and Maestro and mostly the roamers to kill. <br>
<br>
So while DBN had the glory of killing Maestro TWICE and Inny we get screwed on ours with not even proper spawns or Maestro. How fair is that?<br>

IF NOT, then DBN was totally wrong, and their wasting a god doesnt apply. SOL would have killed Inny. Since hate was repopped so late, it should have gone to the next day raid.<br>
<br>
I would like some clarification and proof that Verant said they were taking the zone down. If not DBN should give their next Hate raid over to SOL. <br>
<br>
Sounds more like they felt they were screwed, and wanted the God anyway. I would feel the same way, but rules are rules. We have to follow the rules or throw the damn calendar away!<br>

That is only 5 hours after the last raid is to be finished. Repops are 12+ hours I think =(<br>
<br>
Hate repoped last night at like 11 pacific they still had 3 hours to kill things, this hardly guarentees you Inny and Maestro. I'm sure they killed Maestro the second time well before the 2am mark, as would have any other guild in their place. And if the server had not come down neither Maestro nor Inny would have been up for your raid, not to mention anything else =(<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to defend DBN and if there were violations then there were and they need to be dealt with, however I am hoping you are not dissapointed in the future =(<br>
<br>
I used to go to the planes with a guild that is primarily east coast and euro people. The raids were always early and the raid leaders were always very much in contact with the guild there the day before so they knew when to expect repops etc. They were also very careful reserving dates, trying to co-ordinate so they would get the day after an earlier raid guild. <br>
<br>
Violations aside that is a whole other matter, but if I were you I'd try to make sure when booking a Saturday and planning that early of a raid, that you follow an &quot;early raid&quot; guild. I sincerely hope this doesn't happen to you in the future =(<br>
<br>
For sure any guild planning to start a raid BEFORE 2pm pacific on any day but Saturday especially, needs to have some communication with the guild there the day before. And 7am... wow it's possible you would not see any mobs =( That's not a calendar violation, it's just a result of all the different time zones people are in =(<br>
<br>
I am sincerly sorry and I hope nothing like this happens to you in the future.<br>
<br>
What other guilds do early raids? DoH and SoT for sure I believe. I think Bots also get out of the planes early.  <br>
<br>
For sure don't follow DBN, they are famous for lateness (no offence <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  =(<br>

I think DBN acted in the best interest of the server over all, to loose 2 GODs in one day would be very bad.<br>
<br>
I dont know if they recleared or anything like that but there was a message about possibility of a 6am pac shutdown of hate again.<br>

But no means no ,when next days raid says you may not cut into their time. This has already been proven that no was said and it was done. We werent going to tell them not to go for inny but we sure werent going to give our time to do it. Heres what i propose (starting from here out and does not apply to this incident)<br>
<br>
1. first offense, they forfeit their raid in that plane to the guild affected that month and losing posting rights for any plane that month.<br>
<br>
2. second offense, lose posting rights for 3 months.<br>
<br>
3. final offense, lose posting rights and may not reapply for them for up to 1 year.<br>
<br>
from what im hearing there was no serverwide message. But a general chatfrom gm saying if they didnt fix something it might have to be taken down again? It never said they would nor was there a server wide message. Least thats what ive summed up from the threads ive read and online tells. This to me does not justify it. Only a firm serverwide message saying at 6 am they WILL come down would, not may. I appreciate the apology. Im not here for vengeance on dbn guys lets get this straight, im here for us to iron this out so it doesnt happen again. If a guild says not you cant cross into our time and someone does then what happens. This is what happened. I DO NOT WANT THEIR HATE DATE, I HAVE ONE OF MY OWN. Its not so much that they went over the limit as much as permission was denied at it was done anyways. If this had been KEG or CIW or BOTS, people would be all over them and 100 posts would be here by now. Every guild has their rights. Im here to defend mine not screw them over in return. <br>
<br>
Rewena, most of our guild is eastern and central time. We always start at 10 am eastern on entrance to hate. We have a problem with people showing up late so it literally takes a while to get things going sometimes. We ussually start pulls at about 11 to 1130 am eastern. Reason is we start with the roamers and such to get them out of the way plus we are still young enough we have close to 6 to 10 first timers on these raids so we get theri feet wet so they dont freak when we start pulling 4 or 5 at a time. By this time the first houses in pull order are spawned. they may leave the plane at 2 am pat but they ussually start at 9 pat at the latest so their are mobs up. Our plan was adjusted in this case and was kill roamers, go to throneroom and pull rest of zone and then just kill some roamers till the houses cleared to get to inny popped as well as maestro, who should have been left.<br>
So it actually works out very well on the time table and ussually 6 hrs later were logged or hunting elsewhere. we dont mind waiting for some spawns but they NEED to spawn and should in proper order. In this case they NEVER did.<br>
