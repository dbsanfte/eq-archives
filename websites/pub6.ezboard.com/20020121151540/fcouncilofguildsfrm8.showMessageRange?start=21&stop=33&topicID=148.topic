<br>
I trust the people I raid with.  I dont know many of them, but to be fair many dont know me.  Yet they entrust me with their equipment and experience hoping that I know what I'm doing.  All in the name of having a good time.  I think its only fair that everyone therefore have as good a chance as anyone else to potentially get whatever they want.<br>
<br>
The potential for abuse is evident, that is true.  But part of the spirit of KCoG has been to trust and believe in others.  Yes, I know its possible for people to sell the white scale.  Its also possible for them to sell the eyepatch or a cof.  We know it happens, I've seen both for sale in EC.  Yet that doesnt matter.  I know I prefer to believe in the best in people rather than assume the worst.  I may constantly be setting myself up for disappointment and hurt feelings, but occasionally I find someone who cares that makes up for it.<br>
<br>
And as far as use, the white dragonscale cloak is one of the best cloaks a druid can get.  Sure, there are several awesome pieces out of ToV that are better, but most of us will never see those.  So what is more important?  A scale going to a epic quest that may or may not ever be completed and used in a CoG raid, or a scale going to a cloak that may or may not be sold and may help save both the life of the wearer and make them useful to both CoG and their groups in the future?  Of course this is a loaded question, there is no right answer since it all depends on where your looking at.<br>
<br>
One thing to consider.  If you dont like the loot rules you can of course always post here to try to change it.  This may or may not work.  But, there are other options.  You can begin to actually lead these raids.  You lead a Planar raid, you set the loot rules.  You lead a dragon raid, you set the loot rules.  Of course, if you start really restricting the loot dont expect a lot of people to show up since CoG is not an alliance and is not mandatory.  However, the option is always there.  I'm always looking for people to back me up and I'm sure Kommisar wouldnt mind someone to take the occasional raid to reduce his stress level.<br>

If a scale drops in tonights Vox raid, and i'm there with my bard, I'd feel REALLY guilty if only bards were allowed to roll on the scale because of epic concerns.  Why?  cause there is no way in hell i'd keep it for Steps.  I'd much rather either turn it in for a cloak for Zondro or ecBay it for like 100k.<br>
<br>
It's silly to give white scales to only bards, why? cause to complete the epic you need to be able to drop trak.  If you can drop trak, you can prolly drop gore.  And gore drops white scales a LOT.<br>
<br>
Red scales are the same way.  Talendor is a joke, easily dropped by under 30 people.  So basically, the scales are just an item that certain people use for an epic, while other people use for a BP or cloak.  Yes, if an int caster wins the white scale they will probably sell it and buy a heiro cloak and have cash left over, but you cant let tanks roll on a white scale without letting a caster roll on a CoF.<br>
<br>
basically just pretend everybody is nice honest peoples and wont be selling anything, if an item only seems good for bards and casters lets bards and casters roll, if it only seems good for tanks only let tanks roll.<br>
<br>
If a white scale drops, I'm rolling on it, knowing that MOST of the other people rolling are in the same boat <p>-Zondro Devvildoll

<br>
(1) Do bards count as melee for purposes of rolling for the RBB?  Some guilds have a history of not letting bards roll for haste items because they have their own built-in haste (song).  Not a big deal to me either way, I'd just like to know in advance.<br>
<br>
(2) Do you expect bards to be in there with weapons melee-ing, or using instruments to maximize effectiveness of resist songs? (I punch for up to 7 whole points of damage while using my Selo's drum <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  Or does it depend on the quality of instrument they've got? <p><b><font face="Verdana"  size=-1>Nerissa Goldenrose<br><i>The Chosen Ones</i></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueqkommisar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eqkommisar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Can-Head</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/2/01 3:11:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.chrometiger.com/~anubis/stuff/canhead.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Revised Vox Strategy and loot rules *please read*</span><hr size=1> 1) Bard can roll on haste items (if they haven't already won an instrument on the same raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) as they are considered a melee class.<br>
<br>
2) However, Bards are grouped with the high end tank groups and are expected to play resistance songs (among others at their discretion) to keep the tanks in their group alive as long as possible, allowing them to do as much damage as possible and keep as much taunt on them (and off the casters and healers) as possible.<br>
<br>
We don't tend to get many bards, usually only 1 or 2.  While Bards <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>can</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> do decent melee damage, raising the groups resistances to like 190+ (and thus allowing the lv49+ Warriors in their group to last much longer) seems to be a more effective use of the class.<br>
<br>
The survivability of tanks grouped with a Bard is much higher from my experience.  If the Bard didn't play resistance songs, this would not be the case.  And as I've said many times, keeping tanks alive as long as possible is the way to kill dragons... as long as there are tanks alive, there is a chance to win. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

<br>
Anyway, keeping the tanks alive is first and foremost the most important thing in a dragon raid.  While I will grant you that they may or may not be doing the bulk of the damage, without the tanks the casters are dead meat.  If Vox or Naggy aggro's on a caster then they are usually dead before they can even move.  Dead caster means less damage being done.<br>
<br>
Also tanks with bash and kick and melee attacks have a chance at stunning Vox.  While dragons dont get stunned the way most mobs do, they can be inturrupted.  If you are short on enchanters to mana sieve her, inturrupts are very important.<br>
<br>
So anything that keeps the tanks alive is good.  If you lose all the tanks, I dont care how far down Vox or Naggy is in hps, you will probably lost the raid.  As long as the tanks are up and running you'll probably win.  So bards are very very necessary and needed and wanted for this.  Anyone who says otherwise needs a crash course in Dragon raiding.<br>

But you are still very marginal even if the enchanter is 52.<br>
<br>
Certainly they can stand farther away.  I believe Mana Sieve is one of the few spells that can be cast at max distance from Vox and still take effect.  However, they are still suseptable to Fear.  A feared enchanter is a useless enchanter and if they are feared even 50 percent of the time, they're not casting for that period.  Also, even if they are never feared, they can only cast 1 spell at a time.<br>
<br>
The reason for failure against Vox isnt combat power or resists or even fear.  The reason for failure against Vox is that she Complete Heals.  Pretty much the only reason.  Which of course is why you have enchanters.  But you almost are required to have multiple ones so that there is always at least 1 casting mana sieve or theft of thought at all times, preferably all of them.  It'll take between 4-5 of them generally to sieve her mana.  And if these fights arent over within a minute or so you'll once again probably lose because she'll have killed enough tanks that your casters are again dead meat when she Cheals.<br>
<br>
Bottom line.  No enchanters and I'll give you maybe a 10percent chance at success.  For each enchanter after that you can add about 20-25 percent up to 3.  Past 3 and I dont think they'll add much more than simply accelerate an already fast happening event.  One enchanter certainly can do the job.  However, it is not so great a margin that delaying the raid an hour for an additional enchanter or two isnt worthwhile.<br>

I was at the last Vox raid and I really liked some of the tactics. Having a group go and clear out the IGs before hand was a great idea, as was having a high level task force doing the Buff line. That being said, I was at the end of the buff line and by the time i got to the end my Shammy buffs were already flashing. So, here is my suggestion.<br>
Since most groups (if not all) will usually have at least one buffer in the group have them do the first &quot;throw away buffs&quot;. All that should remain for the Buff Line (for Tanks at least) is:<br>
cleric HP/Symbol Buffs; RM/RC Buffs (can be done either by cleric/Shammy/druid I believe with Druid being the best option due to Circle of X - should one or two of high enough level be around); and finally Haste Buffs from the chanter. I think this could greatly accelerate the Buff Line process...<br>
