<br>
my main riff is this, why is that to an average american, the word socialist and communist are some kind of insult that imply you are evil? lol!<br>
<br>
If it wasnt for socialists you would still have 13year old kids getting their arms cut off in machines in sweatshops.<br>
<br>
If it wasnt for socialists there would be no minimum wage,  everyone that did minimum wage jobs would be making slave wages.<br>
<br>
If it wasnt for socialists buisness' would have no responsibility to the worker's health/safety/retirement/ect ect<br>
<br>
Why is it that so many people consider the words Socialist/Communist some kind of insult?<br>
<br>
Have either one of you read anthing about work condidtions prior to socialist influences like Unions? <br>
Heh.  If believing that business owes something to the people it exploits makes me a communist or socialist then so be it.<br>
<br>
BTW Leiah, the fact that Bush did nothing is what makes him a bad person imo.<br>

Bush did nothing because public officials are NOT allowed to announce inside information that may cause companies to colapse. You never know, Enron could have recovered..if Bush had said something everyone would have sold the stock and would have caused much more damage than was already inevidable.  Yes his informing us would have actually CAUSED Enron's colapse rather than exposing the Enron executives for the crooks they really are either way it was too late..and no matter what people who invested millions were already out.  There's nothing Bush could have or should have done.<br>
<br>
Captitolism is what makes this nation great.  It's what fuels progress.  w/o the promise  of profit and self achievement companies and individuals have no good reason to search for new and better ways of doing things.  Without Capitolism we wouldn't have ball point pens, disposable pens and razors, that machine that cleans up the ice skating rink, x-ray machines, cars, all the latest medical technologies and pharmaceuticals, new and innovative treatment meathods, EverQuest, and OH so much more.  Socialism IS bad because it dilutes motivation, innovation, and the drive to progress the world around you in your own individual way.  Everyone has the option to live the way they want to live, its up to them to put in that old fashioned thing we call work and effort to do it. Individualism = Freedom. <p><center><a href="http://www.silentsentinels.com"><img src="http://www.vanitey.com/sigs/sig2.jpg" border=0 align=bottom></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umuidas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MUIDAS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Orc Legionairre</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:04:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> Dick Cheney refusing to come clean will be the downfall of the Bush administration.  <br>

The Enron issue is just as ugly as all the issues thrown at the Clinton administration. <br>

Thinking that they are different is selective amnesia. And the bias of media in the US is very right wing. Yes, right wing. Live in any other country in the world, and you will recognize how narcissistic and right wing the media and politics in america is. <br>
<br>
And actually the labor unions in america were the ones that got 40 hour weeks, 2 day weekends, sick leave, holiday pay, child labor laws, pension and health care for the common working folks. It was the labor unions that struggled to achieve enough salary for the common worker, so that his wife could stay home and raise children (like the upperclass folks could do. The majority of all wives in america worked while raising children until the early 20th century). It is selective amnesia that causes folks to forget and deny that. Since, most labor unionists were also socialists and communists, it is common to ignore the unions and believe that those social issues and accomplishments were the result of the political affiliations of the unionists.<br>

There wouldn't be enough jobs out there because there would be no large companies to hire the 300 million people in this country.  No integrated circuits, no 2GHz pentiums and athalons, no internet, no cell phones, no Buffy the Vampire slayer, no Lord of the Rings movies, no Sopranos or anything of that nature..why? No body would have bothered because the motivation of individual achievement and profit was not there.  Unless it were spurred on by war time efforts but even then chances are the technology developed there would be poor and inadequate for for the consumer.  Capitolism = Progress. <br>
<br>
 The U.S. dollar is no longer backed by gold or silver, its backed by a nation of consumers who are confident that the TV they want to buy for the living room will be there when they arrive at the store.  All this progress didn't just come from magic smoke, it came from the hard work of people wanting to succeed.  If you saw the History Channel special on U.S. Patent history you'd know what I'm talking about.  Believe it or not that ball point disposable pin you write with has a lot of history and hard work behind it thanks to 2 people's successes and failures.<br>

Don't let the working of a few perverted-socialistic governments (China/USSR/Cuba) guide your thinking on what socialism could represent.<br>

And what would a purely Capitalist government be?  A nation of SLAVES working for NO wages for the Elite.<br>

There would be TV, Movies, etc, but it wouldnt be viewable by the working class.<br>

People have this distorted view of capitolism being viewed as greed.  If you knew how much hard work most of the CEO's of every major corperation went through to get where they are you'd think quite differently.  Capitolism isn't about greed, it's about individual achievement, hard work, and sacrifice.  I didn't get where I am right now by inheriting it from my parents or having it just land in my lap.  I worked HARD.  And if anybody is envious of that then that should spur them on to work just as hard.  Sometimes people fail and fall flat on their face, all I can say is get up and dust yourself off.  If Stephen King hadn't done that I doubt anybody would have a clue as to who he is. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulieah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lieah</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=70896971&img=5" BORDER=0> at: 2/8/02 12:42:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucowardlymonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cowardly Monk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Black Reaver</span><br>  Posts: 1139<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 12:52:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> Funny, when unions were being formed they were seen as the antithesis of Capitalism and the &quot;American Way of Life&quot;.<br>

The above-average person of exceptional intelligence/ability is not properly rewarded for their job.<br>
<br>
The middle class will never perform as they should because they will constantly have their noses rubbed in the fact that they are considered equal to the lazy, shiftless and stupid.<br>
<br>
And in a society where everyone is considered equal the only motivation will be self-motivation.  And that is in VERY short supply within the human race. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucowardlymonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cowardly Monk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Black Reaver</span><br>  Posts: 1141<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 1:00:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> Boy does Luclin know how to digress from a topic or what? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulieah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lieah</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=70896971&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>i r de hottie now!</span><br>  Posts: 1035<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/8/02 1:04:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6253.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Letter to George Bush</span><hr size=1> True, but turns out that not everything is as it seems.

It turns out that neither <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> pure</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> socialism nor <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> pure</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> capitalism works.  What matters is to maintain the right balance -- and doing so without tearing civilization apart.<br>

Bush's job is to safeguard the CITIZENRY of the United States.  Not the Corporations of the United States.<br>
<br>
Citizens benefit by having a stable economy.  Citizens benefit by having their savings/holdings safeguarded against those who would put the common good behind their own greed.<br>

So, I have a few questions for those of you who might know a little bit more about it than I.  These are some of the concerns I have about it.  <br>
<br>
What would its government sctructure look like? and the distribution of power?<br>
<br>
If there is any form of currency how will that NOT alter the balance of equality and power?<br>
<br>
I just don't see how socialism in this current age could work.  I am seriously trying to think outside of the capitalism box that I have lived my whole life in, so if you have any insight that will help me see what some of the socialists see please let me know.  I'm not looking to convert or anything, just to understand.<br>

It showed great integrity.  You have to realize that public officials CANNOT say anything about any public company good or bad.  It is up to the company to report honestly it's financial status.  If Bush had said something then EVERYONE would point their finger at Bush for causing the downfall of Enron, and potentially that could have done considerably MORE damage, and employees would still be out millions.  If you understood how the stock market works you would understand that.   Bush had no right to say anything, he did not, that shows he is on the right track.<br>
<br>
It is not up to the goverment to report the value of a company, regardless if they have inside information.  It amazes me that Bush goes and does the right thing and people still want to blame him and not Ken Lay or Jeff Skilling or Arthur Andersen.   Democrats are grasping for anything at all.  Imagine if Bush had done something...Democrats would be ALL over that, and let me tell ya, that'd be one hell of a scandal for Bush moreso than Ken Lay.<br>
<br>
I met Ken Lay in a meeting after EOG was sold off and I was doing desktop support for Enron Corp.  I also fixed a few issues he was having with his laptop.  He was a nice, so was his secretary, he was a very likable guy, but that doesn't excuse him from hiding secret partnerships and failing subsidiaries.  And it certainly doesn't mean Bush had anything to do with it.  <br>
<br>
Let me repeat, it is up to the company to report earnings, not the government.  If Bush got up there and said something bad about any company regardless if it was or wasn't doing well, it would cause a horrific and massive fluctuation in the stock market and companies that weren't even on the verge of bankruptcies to colapse.  It is a matter of national security that the President's administration remain quiet and as uninvolved as possible except in the area of dealing justice.<br>
