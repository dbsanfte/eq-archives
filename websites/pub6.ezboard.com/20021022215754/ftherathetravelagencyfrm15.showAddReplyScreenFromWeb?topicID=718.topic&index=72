a good deal of frustration about your situation, you are wrong with several of your points. <br>
<br>
First, the 'reasonable amount of time to return' is not a set number. If your power goes off for 12 hours, and you return and say &quot;guys, my power was out for 12 hours, I couldn't help it&quot;, that is a reasonable reason. If you were at work, and the moment you left your house, you went LD, you'd come back and say &quot;I'm sorry, I was at work and I went LD, I couldn't help it&quot;. Only the most draconian and bastardly person would say &quot;mwhar harhar, BACK OF THE LINE FOR YOU&quot;. It's not like you went &quot;link dead&quot; then left the zone, raided and returned and then &quot;logged back in&quot;. As it happens, the weeks leading up to your turn are not very important: as long as you don't leave the zone, and as long as people know why you left, then it really doesn't make anyone really mad. Aes was LD for 4 hours at one point, and upon returning, it wasn't &quot;p!ss off and die&quot; it was &quot;sorry to hear about your connection.&quot;<br>
<br>
The point I made earlier, about gathering numbers to kill ragefire, was that for Aes's epic, we had enough people from outside our guild to kill him, regardless of our own numbers. It wasn't my charming face they came to see. They came to get another ragefire dead and another epic on the server. If there are only 5 people online at any given time that you consider a close friend, do those 5 people not have any friends? I doubt that someone who is well spoken would hang out with 5 individually socially repulsive people. Hell, if you joined the trade channel and said &quot;Can some people please come help me with ragefire&quot; you'd end up with at least 15 more people of the right level, day or night. Send a tell to BotS, Noble Blade, Tindi, whoever has numbers online, hell, even Clan Bashemded if you want. People come for Ragefire, especially if they know that he can't be killed without help.  <br>
<br>
The reason I like the server is that generally, you do get help when you really need it. <br>
<br>
Gather a few more, and unless your fighting force is controlled by a monkey on crack, you're good to go. <br>
<br>
And yes, I will grant that if you left your house for work 30 seconds before ragefire spawned, and you were gone on your turn for him, for 13 hours, then the 12 hour window would expire. That would be really rotten, and I hope it doesn't happen to you. I would say, after 4 weeks+ of being in the zone, if the clerics with you knew you worked long hours, and were at work, they would hopefully object to anyone taking him out from under you. No one said &quot;after 12 hours on the nose it's perfectly nice to kill ragefire&quot;. It's &quot;at least 12 hours&quot;. I doubt there is anyone with a stopwatch at pop time saying &quot;gee, I hope I can ruin this person's day.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for the odds of him popping while at work, you work 4 days a week,10 hours a day. For those four days, you do not work 24 hours a day, therefore the chances of ragefire popping while you are at work is not 4 in 7, but rather approximately 2 in 7. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry if this is coming off as callous or whatever, but what are we looking at here?<br>
<br>
How are we, as a server, going to be able to come up with a solution that fits for people with your schedule? <br>
<br>
You say your long hours mean you can't camp him during the work day reliably, due to LD and the inability to reconnect. <br>
<br>
Ok, that means that right away, it cannot be a 'camp' situation. By the facts of the case, you'd have to be online in some way to 'camp' ragefire. If you can be online, you could be in Skyfire. Therefore, lets brainstorm some alternatives:<br>
<br>
Lottery<br>
Free For All<br>
List<br>
Whichever group gets XP gets the piece<br>
Random of all the clerics in the zone<br>
<br>
The problem with all of these alternatives, in one way or another, is that they also require you to be *online* when ragefire pops. If you are online, you could be in skyfire. If you are not online, you miss ragefire, and your situation doesn't get helped. <br>
<br>
So, honestly, no, I don't expect that you will get your epic soon. I don't mean that in a rude way, or a cruel way, like &quot;ha ha, sucks to be you&quot; kind of way. I also don't think, however, that there is a convention that can be created that people will adhere to, that will also allow people like you to get their cleric epic. What would you need, in a system, to be able to get ragefire with even relative ease?<br>
<br>
There are two things that would work for you. You'd need either a list that had reserved Ragefires, and the mob would be left up until engaged by the person up on the list, otherwise you'd still have to be online when the mob popped and you were on top of the list. (Very much like the system right now, except a shorter list is currently in Skyfire at the moment). Do you, as an intelligent person, think that *anyone* is going to adhere to a reserved ragefire, even when the person on the top of the list is not online? I know we're civilized, but that's not civil, that's dumb. Reservations will never happen: this server will see FFA Ragefire LONG before it sees a set-in-stone, online or not, reserved ragefire. <br>
<br>
That leaves only one solution:<br>
<br>
You would need ragefire to pop by a turn in mob, ala Faydedar for the druid epic. Well, the people on the server cannot create a turn in mob: if we could, it would be done LONG ago. All we can do, is find the best and most fair solution to an utterly f'ucked up camp, which is what we have in place until they change the way the damn thing works. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry that means that you will have a harder time getting your epic. If I could, I'd give every cleric that dings 50 their epic by /petition. (I do not concede the idea that it will be impossible, even if you feel it is)<br>
<br>
The point though, is that no matter how hard it is for you personally as a player to get the epic, you have to understand that no matter what other, alternative system we undertook, it would be *harder* for you to get it, and harder for everyone else as well. The *only* thing that would work, would be a &quot;lets give the item to you first&quot; system. If that works out, let me know so I can institute one for a green scale and queen blade. <br>
<br>
So unfortunately Dytren, every other solution besides a change from a programming standpoint, is not your friend either: so much so, they are actually enemies that are plotting against you. <br>
<br>
Maybe someone with any influence will realize this and understand that it is impossible to talk to ordinary players about the ragefire camp WITHOUT sounding mean. Simply stating the facts of Ragefire's system(s) is rude enough. <br>
<br>
In any event, I'm sorry that the best choice still sucks for you. <br>
<br>
Personally, I would gladly champion any system, so long as it meets the criteria:<br>
<br>
It must be respected.<br>
It must be as fair as possible<br>
It must allow people to have some way to 'claim' a ragefire so it can't be ganked or KS'd. <br>
It must not allow people to claim a ragefire, and then PL a cleric from 1 to 60 before that cleric actually *has* an attempt at ragefire. <br>
<br>
Find me a better one that doesn't involve adding a turn in mob. <br>
<br>
I'll fight for it, every bit as hard. Moreso, actually. <br>
