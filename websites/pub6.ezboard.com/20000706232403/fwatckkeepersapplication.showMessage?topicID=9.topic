<br>
Personal Bio: Having grown up isolated in the wealthy society of Erudin, I was raised to be proper and respectable, without having a mind of my own.  My mother home-taught me, focusing on religion hoping I'd work in the church one day.  My father was very stern and proper, lecturing about ethics, morals, how a &quot;proper woman&quot; should act and how one day I'd marry a rich Erudite man like himself and make him proud.<br>
Never allowed to speak for myself, I followed my teachings quite closely, never causing any trouble, but always finding some fun.  Every morning I'd sneak out to the docks for a swim, or I'd mill among the merchants listening to the travelers tell great stories of the adventures they'd been on and the people they'd met. <br>
Spending most of my time in the palace, life was quite boring and lonely until one day I found a tattered note for Lanken Rjam behind a statue.  Although I was not allowed to converse with him or most people in the upper floors of the palace, I marched right up to him, handed over the note and turned to leave.  He asked me to stay and chat for a bit and I complied although i was so nervous I could barely mutter a sound.  He told me the wonderous stories of his life and adventures as an enchanter and the great mysteries our world held.  When it was time to leave he asked me to come back any time, and he'd show me the ways of an enchanter.<br>
Well, I returned in secret every day at the same time, quickly learning the potentials of my mental and physical talents.  I was taught to fight, cast spells, and even train a pet (although they never listen to me very well).<br>
Eventually my parents noticed that I was gone longer every day, and one morning they followed me and discovered my secret.  They were not at all happy with what I wanted to do and banned me from all aspects of magic in Erudin.<br>
Well, unfortunately for them they said &quot;in Erudin.&quot;  heheh.<br>
Late one night I awoke and discovered how unhappy I was without magic and decided to run away.  I snuck out and went to Lankin to say goodbye and thank you.  He understood how I felt and knew my stubbornness quite well - didn't even try to stop me!  As I was departing he gave me a few necessities to get started in the cold harsh world in front of me, and I ventured off.<br>
<br>
Now a 20th season enchantress, I've wandered through many areas of Norrath: some friendly, some deadly.  I've always been quite isolated and independent, keeping to myself and wary of all others.  I have met a few kind souls, and even joined another guild for a short time.<br>
I've now found a group of people that are as kind and caring as i could have previously only imagined: the Watchkeepers.  I would like to join the Watcheepers and join in their struggle to remove the evils from this land. Life in Norrath is much easier with a kind soul to chat with or simply ask a question.  That's why I'd like to join this guild - I've never met a better group of people to discuss things or just chat with.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
