First time to post on this board in a looong time.<br>
<br>
My guild decided a couple months back that we were interested in visiting the Plane of Mischief.  So we got the poeple and item necessary to gain access, and ventured forth.  Being one of the few mages in my guild, I, or more to the point, my corpse had a great tour of NToV.  Our monk died quite a few times trying to get us into a postion to rez myself.  All in all, it took over 8 hours of steady patient work to do so.  Once there, we set up our coth'r thinking that the work we had done justified us to do so.  Understandably, we were unable to clear the NToV wing, but having a monk FD through that area is a NIGHTMARE undoubtedly.<br>
<br>
Upon arriving in the plane, we were at once bombarded by tells and ooc from the Tindi players.  The motto of the day for us was &quot;Congratulations!&quot; both from Tindi and ourselves.  After explaining how we actually made it there, Tindi offered us full support.  Anything from giving us rezzes, asking us to join their groups, or just plain old information about the zone.  They(ALL) of them have been spectaular and courteous.<br>
<br>
Enter House Calenture.  Since you have arrived in the plane, I have seen sooo many things that I'm really not liking.  From hearing of your KS'ing ways, to getting tells every five minutes from members of your guild trying to recruit me.  Get a clue and get a life.. 5 or 6 computers all lined up playing that many toons doesn't make you uber.<br>
<br>
Most of us that are in the planes now are looking for a good time, and maybe an item or two.  I'm sorry, but if you think Tindi should move out because they've been there a while, get real.  These guys, and the other server guilds, have pretty much solved the zone for the rest of the guilds.<br>
<br>
And for the rest of the people out there interested in visiting this plane.. a couple considerations to keep in mind.  If you're coming here with getting Phat lewt, then think again.  Since Verant nerfed the drop rates in this zone on particular items needed to make said lewt, you will be lucky to see an item every month or so.. and that's being optimistic.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, you're coming here to look at a fun zone, kill some radical beasties, and generally have a great time, then do so.  I just despise all of this.. MY ZONE.. MY MOB.. MY MY MY... give it a rest.<br>
<br>
Guess that's my shpeal.. flame away <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You're there, in pom - fine... but please try to show some sort of courtesy to the people who mapped out exactly what mobs to kill and how to navigate the zone.. aka tindi losi<br>

Incedenally - there is no such thing as non kos to tovN - yes some mobs dnot see invis, and yes, a very limited number are on cov faction (15% or so)  but its unimaginably easier to run up when the 4 dragons and 8 dragon guards are dead, instead of killing you.<br>

<br>
a) Melee boxes/dolls have not been implemement excluding monk.<br>
<br>
b) Theres a hell of a lot more to the zone then resist flowers.<br>
<br>
c) I just got my first piece of PoM armor 2 weeks ago (I have been in the zone for 4+ months) and it was an all/all belt. I'm not complaining about it since the stats are great, but there hasn't been one druid box/doll on the server, yet all Tindi druids are running around in full PoM. Right? We have maybe 3-4 members in near full sets of PoM.<br>
<br>
d) There is no way you guys could possible walk through NToV on a full spawn or does your e-bay instruction manual say otherwise?<br>
<br>
e) You guys gimped your way up into the plane, thats fine, no one can change that. CoHing everyone and anyone that asks is plain stupidity. The zone can be cleared in 1 day with one full group. Ideally it supports 3 groups but even then it is crowded. As of now, at any one time, there are roughly 20 people up in PoM.  Now picture 30 more people up there, all mobs down and basically no loot for anyone.<br>
<br>
f) Card drops were severly nerfed. When 1-2 Tindi groups were up there alone after the nerf, getting 1 piece of decent NON CLASS SPECIFIC armor a week was considered good. You can drool over stats you see on the net but this stuff is rare. I think we've seen 3 pieces of class specific armor in the last month.<br>
<br>
g) Datalore is bound at the firepots in TD, which is why he chose not to bind in PoM. No he wasn't in PoM KSing your 6 toons on 6 comps.<br>
<br>
<br>
There were no problems with PoM. A couple of Shadow Reapers arrived and we welcomed them because they got through on a full spawn. SoT arrived recently but haven't been a hassle despite the recent events. Some Tindi and SoT group and we have shown their members around.<br>
<br>
No problems up to here, until....<br>
<br>
House Calenture arrives and suddenly there are complaints.  Obviously you guys are the problem. If you want to stay in the zone, fine. Just don't f'uck around with others and keep CoHs limited to your guildies.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Plane of Mischief zone was put deep in North ToV for a reason. It's not God damn Seb zone. Read some of the posts on the www.planeofmischief.com boards and see what kind of @#%$ people on other servers have to put up with because of crowding in this zone. Use your heads.<br>
<br>
Not to sound arrogant, but as Emil said...we paved the road for you along with other guilds who beta tested the zone. Show some common courtesy and don't ruin one of the few really interesting zones in the game.<br>

Heh, use that tiny ass pea brain you have inside that big ass ulgy head, and think. Just because &quot;datalore&quot; wasn't In PoM, doesn't mean the person that plays Datalore wasn't there. <br>

<br>
Not a SINGLE person has a full set of PoM.  Even before the nerf, it was rare to get the combos wanted.  Now after the nerf, its near impossible.  Maybe if you ever had some kind of thoughts in your head, you would have common sence to make sure what your saying is valid.  But then again, I wouldn't expect that kind of smart thinking from you.<br>
<br>

<br>
Again, not a single person has Full PoM.  We have NO problem, with ANYONE that wants to come into PoM, and explore.   We have been in PoM for what, 5months or more now, hell I have lost count.  Yes, we had the zone to our selves.  It was perfect, the perfect zone.   Then enter Bots.  Zone not to ourselves, but still the perfect zone, perfect harmony.   Then enter Shadow Reapers, No problems, nothing changes, just new faces to enjoy a zone with.   Then enter SoT, heh, a few problems, mainly because of all the s'hit that has been going on with them... but very little, to no problems.   Enter House Ebayture.  TONS of problems.<br>
<br>
I know your not very smart, but 2 + 2 does not = 5.   Do the math with the facts.<br>
<br>
<br>
When someone puts a brand new white carpet in thier living room, and you visit thier house, do you walk into the room wearing muddy shoes? No. Thats Rude.    You walked into a zone Tindi` Losi helped build, a zone we have no problem sharing, But you disrespected us, and the work we have done. You wore your damn cheap 5 dollar pair of muddy shoes you got off E-bay on our white carpet.  <br>
<br>
I don't speak for Tindi` as a Whole ... but I'm sure most, Tindi, and non-tindi, agree with me.  kthx<br>

<br>
Wow. Nice defensive response, Tyv. No one was even saying anything about SoT, and you respond like people're accusing you guys of giving into Hitler. Again.<br>
<br>
Anyway, not to defend House Corky or anything, I mean those guys are as lame as Deciderius is a homo buttlover, but some folks are misreading something. Datalore claimed that he'd seen members of House Catheter KSing people in PoM. Maktard (or whatever eBay Jimmy's toon's name is) said that Datalore didn't see them KS, because he hasn't been around. Then someone in Tindi` replied that Data wasn't around because he's not bound there. So Mukwank said that that proved his point. He said so cos it did in fact prove his point. If Datalore hadn't been around, then Datalore couldn't have seen them KS. Perhaps it was one of Datalore's roving eyes. Either way, it's a pretty safe bet that, no matter who saw it, members of House Cocksmoker are, in fact, KSing with the fervoured passion of Deciderius chugging human horsey sauce. <p><p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><imgsrc="http://http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/10395.jpg"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Rokvald Dedematshin

No matter what character I play, I refer to myself as Kearlie because that's how everyone knows me.  It may be (and is highly likely) that he saw the KS with a toon other than Datalore. <p><p align = "center">

He was removed from trial membership soon after and we have only heard about him farming post-patched Chardok.

Using a link to PoM website showing the loot table for the zone is lame for the reasons I posted above. Half your members, if not most, wont see s'hit. As for the title image at the top of your page...Honor Loyalty Justice, bullchit, how about showing some?<br>
<br>
A lot of people in this game do things for the experience and take loot as it comes, if any at all. These are the people I respect. People who are loot driven, like your guild, goto PoM, not for the experience of a zone that few get to see, but for loot which you probably won't see for some time.<br>

<br>
The post isn't about POM. We've shared POM with BOTS, Shadow Reapers and SoT graciously for a long time. <br>
<br>
My post is about an antisocial guild, with screwed up values and principles, actively recruiting members. Prospective members should know the history behind these people, so they know what they are getting into. It's hard to build a good rep, and extremely easy to create a bad one.<br>
