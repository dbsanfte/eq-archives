We had a number of people who either weren't sure of the way in, or had a member accidentally killed on the way in. But we gathered together outside the zone and went in about 2:20-2:30 pm. We had 4 groups in all, which eventually filled up completely. Had over 24 in all participate. Those involved were:<br><br>Haemish MacLennan - Silver Daggers<br>Crydee and Sertain - Knights of Hellfire<br>Nieve and Babaganuj - Haven of Light<br>Lancelet - Royal Guardians of Norrath<br>Loredin - The Silent Watch<br>Carpe - Awahili<br>Kanena - Knights of Kindred Faith<br>Bourne - Cold Comfort<br>Demenus, Piquet, Balendin, and Maera - Holistic Crusaders<br>Muin - Allied Giants<br>Xistalben - House Kendan<br>Vanissa - Kindred Souls of Norrath<br>Conalan<br>Relues<br>Kasheu<br>Malldar<br>Elmind<br>Raoulix<br><br>Those who I didn't list a guild for I didn't write down the guild name, but was glad they were there. I decided to send us in in waves of groups,  to take the dungeon in stages. I sent in one group to clear the entrance, then came in with one group after another. We cleared the entrance, then the hallway, then the flag room and set up shop there. Once in the flag room, we pulled from the gate and the door to clear the area both ways. Then we proceeded from one room to the next, clearing spawns one group at a time until we could get to the preacher room. Once there, we found it camped, so moved on to the archeologist's room, which was also camped. I must point out that the people camping there were very helpful, offering to let us kill the spawn, if only they could have the loot they wanted. Faldo and Terabias were these helpful souls and I must thank them. It was very refreshing. <br><br>Since the preacher room was camped, we moved on to the archeologist's room, and waited there for a few spawns. While there, we had to add a few who'd come in a little late, and most of the groups stayed in that room, while I and a few others cleared the way for them to come in. Once back together, we killed a few of the archeologist's placholders, but he didn't show. Rather than wait (as most people were fighting greenies), we decided to move on to other spawns. After gathering back in the flag room, we pulled the gate clear, then rallied around the gate. As I led one group to the alchemist's room, i discovered that 2 of our number, including one group leader, were stuck in the gate. Those who have experienced this horror know that only gating or teleporting out will unstick you. We had Nieve port the two out, and unfortunately none of these could return. Regrouping, I had one group sit in the alchemist's room for a moment, then began leading the other groups to the scryer room. Once outside, we had one returning member, so I sent Babaganuj to the zone to bring them to us. Unfortunately, I didn't realize the casters there can see invis, and he died outside the alchemist's room. I got one group and Sertain our cleric to his body to revive him, and we pulled a LARGE train onto us. We eventually led it back to the other group, but not without a few deaths. Sertain, always on the spot, revived those he could, and we regrouped. We then moved back to the Scryer's room, gathered outside the room, and rushed in when ready. 4 quick kills later and we had the scryer, who held the Wolf Fur slippers. A quick lotto was won by Muin of the Allied Giants, and after a few screenshots in front of the frozen king, we moved back to the alchemist room, as he'd spawned. In less than a minute, he was dead as well, netting us a pair of Mammoth Hide Leggings. I've forgotten who won the lotto for these. <br><br>Then we regrouped outside the king's room at the main gate. By this time, we were down to 2 full groups and 1 extra. After a few quick pulls of the goblins inside the room, we rushed into the gate, whereupon a HUGE train descended on us. With everyone using assist on their main tanks, we dispatched them all, at least 10 goblins in all, including some casters. Then we medded up, taking a look down into the room where the king and his guards normally spawn. There waiting for us was High Priest Zaharn and a number of elite goblin guards. We medded up to full, buffed, healed, discussed our strategy and readied ourselves. Rushing down the path, all hit the High Priest, putting him down quickly, then mopping up the rest. Luck smiled on us, as Zaharn had Zaharn's Coronet and one of the elites had a silvery war axe. Kasheu won the Silvery Axe and Maera won the coronet. We waited for a few more spawns, dispatching them with ease. Then we got the idea of taking down the ice giant diplomat. <br><br>Invising myself, I opened the great double doors where he lives, to see if I could pull him without bringing his brethern with him. I was in luck again, as the diplomat was all alone. One quick swing of my blade and he ran after me, swinging all the way. The groups responded quickly, rushing the behemoth. He hit hard, but we hit harder,  and soon the foul beast fell to the ground, dead! Cheering, we looted the body, finding throwing boulders on him, which I distributed among the warriors, myself, Kanena and Muin. Then it was suggested that we pull the goblin champion. I agreed, and ran through the double doors again, thinking they were clear. However, as I rounded a corner, an ice giant greeted me, signalling his friends to help. I pulled them back into the king's room, hoping against hope we could get away or vanquish them. We were not prepared for this, but the groups responded valiantly, battering away at these juggernauts. We had the help of Myrath, a 51st level wizard who'd come to deliver something to Muin. Somehow, we brought one of them down, and I began to get a glimmer of hope. Another began to run, barely alive. I thought surely we could take the third. The tanks began to fight it, alternately taunting it off of the most hurt tank. We all got healed back to full more than once, but eventually we ran out of mana. One of the groups had no way to evac, so I chose that we stay until the last possible moment. Soon I died, right after Kanena, and right before Muin. The halls of Halas soon filled up with our tanks returning to their bind spot. Though we had felled 2, the third got us. Only 3 survived, as they were able to gate out. <br><br>I must say I was impressed with our corpse recovery. Our mage Reclues summoned weapons we all could use, and our enchanters, Vanissa and Elmind went invis trying to drag corpses back. We rezoned into Perma, and both enchanters began dragging corpses back. Vanissa died at least once trying to retrieve corpses, maybe twice. Elmind cooly and calmly dragged Sertain's and some of the tank's corpses to the entrance. Once we had a few tanks, we proceeded to the flag room, where the rest of the corpses were dragged. <br><br>All in all, I think it was successful. We didn't get all the named spawns, but when we found them we handled them well. Those who stayed until the end enjoyed themselves, and we got some loot worth lottoing. We took and held the King's room with only 13 people, and then took down the Ice Giant Diplomat, which was a bonus to me. I felt that this group MIGHT have been able to take down an Ice Giant, if we could have had them solo. <br><br>Problems were few, though I must mention 2 problems. <br>1) Boredom... some people commented that they were getting bored taking out greenies, and some left because of this. I'm a nice guy, but I must say this is a disappointing attitude. From what I've heard of the planes and dragon raids, sitting for hours on end is not uncommon, both healing, rezzing, buffing and regrouping. This was safe boredom, but I think planes raids have MUCH more boredom, followed by moments of much more danger. I'm not sure if we had the right level range for this hunt (may have been too high), but we did have some moments of danger. <br>2) Pulling without being asked or told to. We had problems with one person who pulled when he wasn't asked to, then kept pulling after he was told not to. He was lucky in that he didn't pull enough things on us to kill the whole group, but in a plane or dragon raid, he would have been banished from the raid and never invited back. I will be very hesitant to let him back on a raid again.<br><br>All in all, I thank everyone for showing up, as it was a great raid. <br><br>Haemish MacLennan<br>Clan Chieftan<br>The Silver Daggers <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubalendin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balendin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(7/23/00 4:28:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsevents.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/wildelf1/bal.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: After Action Permafrost Report</span><hr size=1> I agree to all the things said about boredom, the boredom in plains is endless.
