With so many ooc/say/shouts going on it is very difficult to keep things straight. Problems arise and they are dealt with the best way they can at that time. There is no reason to question anything that was done at the raid. It was done as best we could with the information we had. I agree with some of the previous posts but will not list them as I know that the staff did a good job even with mistakes (myself included)  Again, if anyone thinks they can do a better job, then please do, I am always looking for better ways to do 'things' and would like to learn from the best! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

 I think the buffing line went very well.  People lined up and went through with a minimum of fuss.  <br>
<br>
 Secondly, I'd like to bring up that once we all camped to chat and Azure came in, people cleared the channel to let her speak. <br>
<br>
 Considering the issues that were happening in game, these at least was done properly and professionally. <br>

 Good job Azure, thank you support staff.<br>

<br>
ive been comin to vox and naggy raids well over a year now.. and i must admit last night was THE worst i have ever been to.<br>
<br>
not for the way it was ran, that was great, but for the ppl who came to kill the dragon who wanted the glory the loot etc..<br>
<br>
there were a lot of us there last night.. hell even 2 support teams... half the time u cant get 2 support ppl never mind teams.<br>
<br>
ive been where they all were.. egre to kill the dragon role on loot been disapointed when u havent won or when the dumbass dragon hasnt died.<br>
<br>
but theres a certain conduct that simply HAS to be followed.. rules arnt meant to be broken.<br>
<br>
so anyone that comes along next time.. please be a little more friendly.. sit relax watch a movie inbetween camps (king room ramp bridge etc) just sit back and have some fun... no good bitching and whineing at people.. where does that get u ? gets u nowhere.. <br>
<br>
i suggest before u sign up for the next raid you make sure you read the rules.<br>
<br>
also another thing is if your coming to the raid.. and u dont get in from school/work until the raid is due to start or has started... get there the night before, camp out there.<br>
<br>
a couple of ppl complained about the 30pp raid fee.. hah goto mistress jalna in qeynos see what shell give u for 30pp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  bet its no where near as fun as killing or attempting to kill a dragon!<br>
<br>
anyhow.. cya all there next time hopefully a little mroe relaxed and having fun.<br>

I'm sorry that there were so many incompitent and rude people there who make the raid unpleasant.  Unfortunately the raid took a lot longer because of people not listening and I had to leave right before the buff line. <br>
<br>
I hope the next Naggy raid will go more smoothly since I still have not seen this big ugly lizard.  I will see you at the next Vox raid and will most likely still be lvl52. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for all of the problems I have some suggestions to solving them, some you may like and some you may not... the policies in place are fine but these are just my ideas to what might make the raid go more smoothly:<br>
<br>
1- The possibility of raising the minimum lvl for raiding to lvl45 so you will have a little less people but hopefully some more experienced people.<br>
2- If people are not doing what they are told... don't be nice, just kick them out and maybe they will learn.  I know you are just a very nice person but people might be getting the impression that they can get away with stuff and I don't think that should happen.<br>
3- Possibly make the raids sign up only and have a limited number of people allowed and call the roll once you have that amount.<br>
4- Don't let people join a dragon raid late unless they had already posted on the board that they will be late.<br>
5- If people fuss about loot in any way then maybe ban them from rolling on items.  These raids are not to be attended for the sole reason of gaining &quot;uber&quot; loot.  I myself have attended the Vox raids because the thrill of killing a dragon excites me and is very fun.<br>
<br>
Again, I know some people will disagree with what I have just posted, but these are MY opinions and mine alone.<br>
<br>
 <br>
I would like to thank all of the support team, raid leaders and especially Azure for having an uncharted amount of patience in dealing with the poor manered people that attended this raid.  I would also like to thank the raiders who made it less stressful to the raid leaders by not whining, complaining and bickering about loot. <p><p>

Thanks again for a great job leading another successful KCoG dragon Raid. Primortius, I didn't say so before but that was by far the nmost organized and efficient buffline I have seen. <br>
<br>
As to Nottys comment that this was the worst raid, in terms of behavior, that he had seen, I have seen far worse. The first Vox raid I attended was far worse. People were questioning every facet of the entire raid right up to the point of the inevitable TPW. That raid was a resounding failure, not because of Kommisars leadership, but because no one was following orders and constantly objected to every single one of Kommisars instructions. It was my first Dragon raid so I didn't realize then how bad it was then, I do now.<br>
<br>
One thing Primortius said I do have to disagree with. You said that the decisions of the raid leadership should not be questioned on this board. I disagree. If a person has an issue with how something in a raid is handled, this is the only place to bring up the issue. Not in ooc. not in shout. not by tell bombing the raid leadership during the raid. If issues aren't raised here, how can they be resolved? Although I was around when KCoG formed back in 1999 I was more concerened with taking the boat to freeport safely than with such things as planes and Dragon raids so I can't say for sure but it would be my guess that it took a lot of trial and error before KCoG got to the point that we are at today in regards to our ability do take down the Dragons. This undoubtedly involved a good deal of questioning the tactics of the raid leadership and thoughtful (hopefully) discussion of the issues that arose during each raid. If we are to continue to grow and improve the only way we can do that is thru discussion and feedback on issues when they arise. How can a problem be addressed and rectified if no one raises the issue? you say that there is no reason to questin anything that was done at the raid. I'm sorry but again, I can't agree. This is not a Dictatorship. I agree totally that during the raid you follow orders period. But if issues arise that yone feels need adressing, people not only should bring them here but would be derelict in their duty to KCoG if they didn't raise issues that occurr. There has been a long tradition of bringing issues and problems to this board. That is a large part of what KCog is here for, a forum where people can raise issues and work out solutions. Our server is unique in having a community that does this. I didn't bring up issues to complain nor to challenge the raid leaderships abilities. If you read my previous posts you will see that I have nothing but praise for the abilities of the raid leadership and respect for the decisions that were made. But I had issues with how some things were handled and so I raised those issues here and have had them addressed.<br>
<br>
As for stating that people should step up if they think they can do better, and I pretty much said the same thing, if this is being directed at myself, Destructress , or Kcarcreve you are barking up the wrong tree. Our guild has stepped up to lead planes raids for KCoG. We know what it is like to try and control a daycare with the koolaid spiked with acid. That is why we brought these issues to this board for meaningful discussion. When Kommisar stepped down form leading Dragon raids, we seriously considering leading those but the random nature of dragon raids and our work schedules made that impossible and Azure has stepped up and has done a fantastic job. If this is being direccted at those who don't follow orders and continually question the raid leaders direction in public channels during the raid, I couldn't agree more.<br>
<br>
I doubt I will check this post again as I have said all that I need to say and the issues that I raised have all been answered. Whether I personally agree with the reasoning behind some of the answers i will keep to myself as it is not relevant as long as i am not the raid leader. thanks again all for participating with your thoughts, suggestions, and answers. <p>Falcone Robinsbane<BR>

<br>
Thank you to Azure and Tsaryn...as well as Destructress and all of the people in KCoG that make sure that those of us that want too can have a good time and a great EQ experience.<br>
<br>
I'm known for being quite cocky,and a bit of a cynic.But in all honesty i know i couldn't do the things you folks do.<br>
<br>
as far as loot on dragon raids go....I would be lying if i said it wasn't a big deal...but if i don't win my role or there is confusion of some kind i know enough not to question the leadership on an open channel.I can only be mad at the damn Dragon or whatever creature...hehe...not a person out there in the real world that is trying just as hard as i am to maintain focus and control.<br>
<br>
for those that whine and complain and spend more time detracting from the raid then actually helping i say this:<br>
<br>
PLEASE DON'T COME BACK!!!!....<br>
<br>
go find someone elses time to ruin.<br>
<br>
