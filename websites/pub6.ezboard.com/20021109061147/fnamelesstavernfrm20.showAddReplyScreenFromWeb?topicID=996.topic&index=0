<br>
The teacher asked, &quot;Harry, what is your problem?&quot; <br>
<br>
Harry answered, &quot;I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!&quot; <br>
<br>
Ms. Brooks had had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. <br>
<br>
The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test and if he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade andbehave. She agreed. Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test. <br>
<br>
Principal: &quot;What is 3 x 3?&quot; <br>
<br>
Harry: &quot;9&quot;. <br>
<br>
Principal: &quot;What is 6 x 6?&quot; <br>
<br>
Harry: &quot;36&quot;. <br>
<br>
And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know. <br>
<br>
The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, &quot;I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ms. Brooks says to the principal, &quot;Let me ask him some questions.&quot; The principal and Harry both agreed. <br>
<br>
Ms. Brooks asks, &quot;What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?&quot; Harry, after a moment: &quot;Legs.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ms. Brooks: &quot;What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?&quot; <br>
<br>
The principal wondered, why does she ask such a question! <br>
<br>
Harry replied: &quot;Pockets.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ms. Brooks: &quot;What does a dog do that a man steps into?&quot; <br>
<br>
Harry: &quot;Pants&quot; <br>
<br>
Ms. Brooks: What's starts with a C and ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin whitish liquid? <br>
<br>
Harry: Coconut <br>
<br>
The principal's eyes open really wide and before he could stop the answer, <br>
<br>
Harry was taking charge. <br>
<br>
Ms. Brooks: What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky? <br>
<br>
Harry: Bubble gum <br>
<br>
Ms. Brooks: What does a man do standing up, a woman do sitting down and a dog do on three legs?&quot; <br>
<br>
The principal's eyes open really wide and before he could stop the answer. <br>
<br>
Harry: Shake hands <br>
<br>
Ms. Brooks: What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement? <br>
<br>
Harry: Firetruck <br>
<br>
The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, &quot;Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last seven questions wrong&quot;. <br>
<br>
==============================================<br>
<br>
Below is a true story...<br>
It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. <br>
<br>
After the wedding, at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. <br>
<br>
He especially wanted to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a fabulous reception. <br>
<br>
To thank everyone for coming, bringing gifts and everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair, including the wedding party, was a manila envelope. He said that this was his gift and told everyone to open their envelopes. <br>
<br>
Inside each envelope was an 8x10 photo of his best man having sex...with the bride. He had gotten suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them weeks prior to the wedding. <br>
<br>
After he stood there and watched the people's reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said, &quot;F*CK you!&quot; He turned to his bride and said, &quot;F*CK you!&quot; Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said, &quot;I'm out of here!&quot; <br>
<br>
He had the marriage annulled the first thing that Monday morning. <br>
<br>
While most of us would have broken off the engagement immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with it anyway, as if nothing was wrong. <br>
<br>
His revenge: <br>
<br>
Making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for 300 guests for a wedding and reception. <br>
<br>
Letting everyone know exactly what did happen. <br>
<br>
And, best of all... trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends and their entire families. <br>
<br>
This guy has balls the size of church bells. <br>
<br>
Do you think we might see one of those MasterCard &quot;Priceless&quot; commercials out of this? Huh? <br>
<br>
Elegant wedding for 300 family and guests -- $32,000 <br>
<br>
Photographers for the wedding -- $3,000 <br>
<br>
Deluxe Honeymoon accommodations in Maui for 2 weeks -- $8,500 <br>
<br>
The look on everyone's faces after seeing a photo of the Bride and Best Man having sex -- Priceless!!! <br>

===============================================<br>
<br>
Two couples were playing cards one evening. John accidentally dropped some cards on the floor. When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed that Bill's wife's legs were wide apart, and she wasn't wearing any underwear! Shocked by this, John upon trying to sit back up again, hit his head on the table &amp; emerged red-faced. Later, John went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. <br>
<br>
Bill's wife followed &amp; asked, &quot;Did you see anything that you liked under there?&quot; Surprised by her boldness, John admitted that, well, indeed he did. <br>
<br>
She said, &quot;Well, you can have it but it will cost you $500.&quot; After taking a minute or two to assess the financial situation as well as the moral costs of this offer, John says that he is indeed interested. She tells him that since her husband, Bill, works Friday afternoons &amp; John doesn't, that John should be at her house around 2pm Friday afternoon. <br>
<br>
When Friday rolled around, John showed up at Bill's house for the planned time at 2pm sharp &amp; after paying her the agreed upon $500, they went the bedroom &amp; completed their sexual transaction as Sue had promised. <br>
<br>
Afterwards, John quickly dressed &amp; left. As usual, Bill came home from work at 6pm &amp; upon entering the house, asks his wife abruptly, &quot;Did John come by the house this afternoon?&quot; With a lump in her throat, Bill's wife answered, &quot;Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon&quot;. <br>
<br>
Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband curtly asked, &quot;And did he give you $500?&quot;. <br>
<br>
In terror, she assumed that somehow he had found out, &amp; after mustering up her best poker face, replied, &quot;Well, yes, in fact he did give me $500&quot;. <br>
<br>
Bill, with a satisfied look on his face, surprised his wife by saying, &quot;Good, I was hoping he did. John came by the office this morning &amp; borrowed $500 from me. <br>
<br>
He promised me he'd stop by our house this afternoon on his way home &amp; pay me back.&quot; <br>
<br>

<br>
A girl and her boyfriend go to the pub. When it's the girl's turn to buy a round, she tells him that she's heard of a wonderful new drink he simply must try. <br>
<br>
She returns with the usual half of lager for herself. For him, she has two glasses. One contains a measure of Bailey's, the other lime juice. <br>
<br>
Instructions: &quot;OK, what you gotta do is, you gotta swig the Bailey's, hold it in your mouth, and then drink the lime juice.&quot; <br>
<br>
He looks a bit dubious, but she's very enthusiastic so he decides to give it a go. <br>
<br>
First the Bailey's; lovely smooth, creamy, warm feeling in the mouth. <br>
<br>
Then he takes the lime juice. <br>
<br>
0.1 secs: The cream in the Bailey's curdles. <br>
<br>
0.3 secs: Boyfriend's face turns the color of fresh lime juice. <br>
<br>
0.6 secs: Boyfriend calms his stomach &amp; swallows the gunge. <br>
<br>
1.5 secs: She whispers in his ear.... &quot;It's called Blowjob revenge&quot; <br>

So, he went down the road to the next farmer and asked if he had a rooster that he would sell to him. The other farmer said,<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I've got this great Australian rooster name Kenny. He'll service every chicken you got, no problem.&quot;<br>
Well, Kenny the Australian rooster would cost a packet, but the farmer decided he'd be well worth it. So, he bought Kenny.<br>
<br>
The farmer took Kenny home and set him down in the barnyard, first, giving the rooster a pep talk. <br>
&quot;I want you to pace yourself now. You've got a lot of chickens to service here, and you cost me a lot of money. Consequently, I'll need you to do a good job. So, take your time and have some fun, ... &quot; the farmer said with a chuckle.<br>
<br>
Kenny seemed to understand, so the farmer pointed towards the hen house and Kenny took off like a shot. WHAM! Kenny nailed every hen in the hen house-three or four times, and the farmer was really shocked. After that the farmer heard a commotion in the duck pen. Sure enough, Kenny was in there.<br>
<br>
Later, the farmer saw Kenny after a flock of geese, down by the lake. Once again, WHAM! He got all the geese. By sunset he saw Kenny out in the fields chasing quail and pheasants. The farmer was distraught and worried that his expensive rooster wouldn't even last 24 hours.<br>
<br>
Sure enough the farmer awoke the next morning only to find Kenny on his back, stone cold in the middle of the yard. Buzzards were circling overhead.<br>
<br>
The farmer, saddened by the loss of such a colourful and expensive animal, shook his head and said, <br>
&quot;Oh, Kenny, I told you to pace yourself. I tried to get you to slow down, now look what's happened&quot;. <br>
<br>
Kenny opened one eye, nodded towards the buzzards circling in the sky and said, &quot;Shhh, they're getting closer.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uphantomfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phantomfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sarcastic Sensei</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#333333>(9/25/02 4:52:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=996.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: more ...</span><hr size=1> A teenage boy arrived home late from school one day.
