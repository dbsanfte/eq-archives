<br>
I was lying in bed tongiht and I couldnt sleep.  All I kept thinking about was this game and how over the last few days a lot has changed for me.  I am not getting in to what changed in game but it has been a few months and it wasnt about a stupid key or anything else like that.<br>
<br>
When I joined Apex a long time ago it was because it was a close family.  It was people playing to have fun.  We didnt care about killing big mobs and getting amazing loot.<br>
<br>
But all that has changed.  Its not Endorean's fault that it happened.  Its the way the high level game is.  If you are 60 you get bored and you have to have some kind of challenge.  But the pressure of it all changes the game dramatically.  You cant really play for fun anymore.  Not when it takes 40 people a few hours to try something and you may not succeed.  It is not as much fun as grouping with a rogue and 4 shadow knights in Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
Yes, I could play a twink or something.  But once you have played the high level game that mentallity stays with you.  You just cant lose it.  I found that out when I was in a group today and I made sure everybody assisted me and that, well you get the picture.  My twink is level 18, how much fun can I have going threw the low level game making sure groups do all the things the high level game teaches you.<br>
<br>
I miss the days when I thought my Totemic Helmet was the best in the game I would ever own.  I miss the days when I got my wisdom to 200 and had sucky resists but I didnt care because you know what, I didnt know what resists really meant and I was just so proud my wisdom was at 200.<br>
<br>
In the end it all caught up to me and I dont feel like sacraficing my life to this game anymore.  I have let a lot of my life slip threw my hands for this game and I am not going to let it happen anymore.<br>
<br>
Teidilu - What can I say here that I havent already said to you in game and on instant message programs.<br>
<br>
Endorean - dont lose what you were made to be.  Dont let them make you raid every night and dont let them make you feel bad if you dont kill uber mob XXX.  There are more important things then that and you shouldnt let them slip threw your fingers.<br>
<br>
Faelin - your mom wanted me to say goodbye to you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I am going to miss you guy.  I always had fun taking shots at each other and the time you used Torlan to pl us to 60 in Seb zone out.<br>
<br>
Chenu - I will miss you terribly hun.  You are such a good friend but I know you will keep in touch, you promissed you would.<br>
<br>
Linza - I am so sorry hun,  You have no idea how sorry I am but sometimes you do things hoping they will make your life better but instead you end up with two troubles instead of one.<br>
<br>
Ezukara - stay in touch hun and play your twink more.  Make sure the game stays fun for you.<br>
<br>
Sbik - I miss you guy.  get my email and AIM from the bottom and stay in touch.  I plan to see you in Worlds of Warcraft.  I can tell you I will be on the first server alphabetically and I will have the name Jushiro so I wont be hard to find.  I wont make the same mistake there I did in EQ though.<br>
<br>
Benny - No, we never did talk in game.  But you are a great guy and I will miss you<br>
<br>
Teeil - I hope stuff works out for you, you arent a bad guy<br>
<br>
Yankin - /dance somehow you never let the high end game get to you, I wish I would have asked for advice<br>
<br>
Traggle - I am glad you came back.  It was good talking to you and giving you the Velious tour<br>
<br>
Jascenta - I hope things keep going great for you in rl<br>
<br>
Wang, Segal, Kalasii, Maob, Razzel, Arriena (boy I hope I remembered how to spell that right), Viajero, Heimdol, Sabrina (Lieah), Franko, Tarsishim and Scaab - You guys were the reason I joined Apex and when you all left (well, Heimdol is till around but you get the point), well it changed everything<br>
<br>
Deeva and Amberyll - I miss you two.  It took some work but you convinced me to leave Apex and join Endorean.  I may still have that Apex tag if it hadn't been for you two.\<br>
<br>
Hypnotic - I wish we killed Ak'Anon and the Mayor one last time.  I wanted to go out an ally in Runnyeye.<br>
<br>
Travell - /hug what more can I say.  You left twice without telling anybody but when you came back, I was the first to know.  At least I felt I was<br>
<br>
Misbik - I do regret that you weren't around for me to say goodbye to.  You always made me smile, heck I think you made the server smile.<br>
<br>
Eroc - I know you havent played on Luclin since just after I started and I know you may never see this.  But you were the first person on my friends list when I played this game.  I remember logging on and hoping you would be on so I would have somebody to group with and show me around.  We killed in CB together, we killed Minotars in Steam Front together.  You gave me my first ever guild invite and I regret I didnt take it.   I dont know where you are or what you are doing, but I never forgot you.  (Talguise 19 ranger, retired a long time ago).<br>
<br>
Torlan - dont mess up, you know what I mean<br>
<br>
I know I missed people, but I think I went over my alloted speach time.  So I wil lend with letting you all know that all my dropable stuff was given away.  I am not going to say to whom but they will put it to great use.<br>
<br>
I promissed some of you I would leave this information so you could stay in touch with me:<br>
<br>
Yahoo: Frnkengoof<br>
AIM: Frnkengoof<br>
emaill: buff_marcus@hotmail.com<br>

You are arrogant, gruff, and some people think you have a terrible attitude.<br>
<br>
You are also the person who kept me in the game at least twice when I was a newbie doing dumb newbie things (well I still do that lol, but now I don't get as upset and frustrated).<br>
<br>
You're a great person.<br>
<br>
I also think they're wrong about the attitude <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I hope to encounter you in another form on another world someday. Until then I hope RL is good and the the demons of Norrath do not haunt your dreams. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=55641">Maharet Ferobbee</a> - Barbarian Luminary of Endorean - EQ Luclin<BR>

You were part of our family, and we could not have the family without you when Endorean was reformed.  You made the nightly grind we all called a game, but some considered work, much more fun than it would have been.  It was a great trip and you will always be a part of our family and in our memories of Everquest!  Hope all goes well, and I hope you will not be a stranger to all of the friends you still have both inside and outside of Everquest.  Follow the link that Segal posted to get in touch with much of the family on the outside if you are ever bored.<br>

You are who you are man, and nothing can ever change that.  You don't have to be peaches and cream to play your class right and get the job done.<br>

  Hey bro Sorry to see things end like this and u know what I mean I have always liked u and always will I consider u a good game friend What ever game it might be.  I know how u feel about RL though Its a very good thing to Make RL important again if it has gone through some changes and u have missed them.  Eq makes that easy to Happen.  I Hope u think about Keepin your account if u can afford it because a few months off definatly changed my opinion of the game and I play for different reasons but either way weath u never play again or start up some day further down the road shoot me a tell or post for me I will aways be willing to lend a good friend a hand <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Make RL fun and if u don't think about eq again its a good thing bro Take Care.<br>
