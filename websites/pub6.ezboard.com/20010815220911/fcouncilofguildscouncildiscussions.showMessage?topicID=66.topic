It seems there is a new guild on Karana, Shattering Steel, that has the potential to throw a monkeyt wrench into all the large target rotations.  Shattering Steel is a splinter guild from Harbingers, and they have the strength to do large targets up to and including the Planes.<br>
<br>
From the information I have read, Shattering Steel (SS) is NOT joining the KGC.  Meaning they are not following the rotations and taking all large targets as FFA.  Several guilds and alliances including Harbingers and AoVB are not helping this guild in any fashion.  No ports, no rezzes..... the full cold shoulder treatment.  The KGC is considering banding together to alleviate this problem.<br>
<br>
Meaning, they are willing to &quot;toss aside&quot; the rotations for the moment and band together to take down the large targets before SS can.  The loot all goes to the guild/alliance that was up for the target.<br>
<br>
As I said, this is posted for informational purposes only.  I do not intend to sway you or your guild, but provide you with information.<br>

The only real large rotational targets they can concievably take out are Vox and Naggy, and that assumes they have enough lower level players for the rush, and enough high (55+) players to buff.  Other than that, they certainly cant take out Trak or the Gods and even Gore and Woushi would probably give them trouble.  The main reason is these larger targets are not a spur of the moment raid.  You saw how hard it was for CoG to muster strength on our previous Vox raid with less than 6 hours warning.  How many people do you think SS will be able to muster with only thier guild to call upon?  <br>
<br>
Some targets they can always camp I suppose, like VS.  But that gets boring after a longtime.  And of course if they try to jump your plane, just invoke PNP on them.  They will eventually get the message.<br>
<br>
It sounds to me as if they are just thinking that by ignoring KGC they can get the phat lewt faster.  In reality guilds abide by KGC because it is the best way we've found to go.  Large targets and Planes take a longtime to setup for, even for the experienced.  An hour is about the minimum I've seen for a Plane raid, and lets not go into how long it takes to clear to Trak.  When you add in PNP its simply not going to be worthwhile for them in the long run.  Even without being shunned.  The rotational system was partially developed to stop KSing and the anarachy of FFA, however, it also has the side benefit of saving a lot of time.  You just show up for your raid and go.  SS will have to camp for hours, perhaps days, if they want to KS a guild/alliance on rotation.  It wont be worth it since they are in the end only 1 guild and will have to compete against everyone in KGC.  It could be dicey for awhile but as long as everyone stays calm and mature about things, SS will eventually go away.<br>

Especially a European or Asian guild.  However, if they try that my suggestion is for the other guild to go in anyway.  SS cannot have been in the plane for more than a couple of hours.  The farthest they could have gotten is about halfway.  At that point, thank them for breaking the plane and invoke PNP on them.  No one owns a plane or spawn, and Verant will enfore PNP.  The European or Asian guilds will probably have to start their raids a tad bit earlier now, or at least get preped in case, but thats about it.  Sure individually a guild/alliance can get screwed by them.  But think of the time investment in breaking into a plane, or even just staying through the repop.  SS does not have that kind of resources to screw everyone.  Because they are not operating against 1 guild or alliance, they are operating against over 18.  Add to this they are getting partially screwed everytime they do this and the generally shunning they may get and they will get their act together or disintegrate soon.<br>
<br>
What does this mean for CoG?  Not much I'd say.  Unless they are terminally stupid and pull the same thing on us.  In which case they will have managed to annoy about 3/4 of the server in one way or another.  One renegade guild will not be able to break KGC.  Not even Grey Hawk or Valoran could do that.  Its when several guilds decide that they dont want to play nice that you've got a problem.<br>
<br>
Just dont play their game by their rules.  Thats always a losing proposition.  Make them play by your rules.  They will discover for themselves KGC exists for a reason beyond greed and elitism.  they are only fooling themselves if they think they can get away with anything.  And in the end, this IS only a game.  Possessions, items, cash, these things can all be replaced.  Force them to waste real life time with no compensation and they'll shape up.  Believe me, they are not that hard core.<br>

I fully support KCoG and KGC.  A guild such as this that endorses a FFA policy will severely hamper smaller guilds from getting a chance to participate in these raids.<br>

Now instead of one guild there will be two, maybe more , who refuse to abide by KCG guidelines. Being GL of a small guild myself, most would believe that none of this concerns me or my guild since we are not able to do dragons or planes without the help of the KCoG.

Seriously, that thread sounds more like some wannabe 14 year old who thinks that by posting that he can get some attention.  I mean, get real.  He states that many 60's are retiring out of boredom, but his guild will only consist of 58-60's?  Ummmm, sure.  Oh, and they have to have their epics.  Er...whatever.  Just how many epic wielding players do you know?  Thats what I thought.  Most of them belong to high level guilds and it took the entire guild/alliance/friends to get them their epics.  They are not just going to jump ship to screw all of their friends.  Whoever posted that really has no clue and just wants the attention his mother never gave him.  <br>
<br>
I've said it before and let me say it again.  KGC is not held together by trust, or friendship, or the feeling of being 3l33t D00ds.  Nor is it even held together because they all want the ph4t L3wt for themselves.  It is held together through mutual self interest.  A concept many others cannot seem to grasp, especially the poster of that thread.  None of the guilds in KGC NEED the rotation.  None of them, including CoG, have to abide by it.  They abide by it because the alternative is anarchy and rampant KSing.  It is a convenience, and that is a good thing in a game.  Before everyone gets excited about this, take a good look at all the level 58-60's with their epics on Karana.  Ask to inspect them.  Then go to Allakhzam's and look up their equipment.  Then ask yourself if those people really need to join an Uber guild who's sole purpose to to screw the guilds their currently in?  I mean, when was the last time you saw a level 60 with their epic that needed a BP from Trak?  They dont, if they dont have it (weird but possible) it'd pretty muuch only be a status item.  Believe me, that post is a troll.  Shattering Steel isnt, however, they do not have the strength to break KGC.  A few weeks of shunning and they will get the message.  Personally I hope all the members of SS have some reserve cash, because in a month they'll be petitioning Verant to move their characters to another server.<br>

I personally was kind of on the fence about this.  I do not believe that they can survive wth their current policies and I did not believe that shunning SS would have any positive benefits other than to push them even further to the edge.<br>
<br>
However, upon further reflection I realized something.  Shattering Steel has already taken a side.  They have chosen to do something the rest of us think is wrong.  And there must be consequences to those actions.  The rotation system that we know on Karana is pretty close to unique.  Most servers dont have one, and even the ones that do are restricted to mainly a few uber guilds.  KGC works for everyone.  Because of that I've decided to personally support whatever action the general community feels is warranted.  This does not include anything that would be against Verant policy rules of course like KSing or intentional training, even if Shattering Steel begins to adopt such methods.  I will not be dragged down to that level just for a game.  I do have reservations about shunning someone or a guild, but something has to be done and sitting on the fence or ignoring the situation is the same as helping SS.  I would urge anyone that attends CoG Plane or Dragon raids to also support KGC in this.  CoG can really only do Plane and Dragon raids because of KGC.  Without them, our setup times are too long to do this on our own.  I realize that many people may not want to take sides on something that does not directly concern them, but believe me when I say this does.  I do not believe that Shattering Steel is a major threat that can break KGC.  It is, however, a problem that needs to be dealt with.  I would further urge people not to attend raids that have members of Shattering Steel in them.  If they wish to stand apart from the rest of us, then they should stand alone.  <br>
<br>
This is not something I really wanted to do.  The major reason I dont have a guild is that I want to help those I can without worrying about politics and crap like that.  But this issue is larger than I am, and has the potential to become a server issue if ignored.  It probably wont ever be, and will die a painful death of its own, but everyone on the board is right to say that this wont happen if we ignore it.<br>

Rather than having to rush and scrabble to get enough people ready to kill Vox the moment she spawns, we usually have a good day or two of warning (sometimes weeks). We have a week to prepare for planes raids. The CoG is part of the KGC in that we adhere to their rules for planes raids and dragon rotations. The KGC isn't perfect by any means, but it DOES mean that guilds and people who adhere to the rotations get a shot at experiences they might have to wait a year for otherwise. Because of the KGC's rules, the CoG is allowed to let people who aren't even IN a guild, like Kellory, onto planes and dragon raids, WITHOUT joining a big uber guild. In short, the KGC allows the CoG to do something it couldn't do otherwise. <br>
<br>
I do not support the idea of &quot;beating&quot; the members of Shattering Steel to spawns however. All I am asking is passive resistance to the breaking of a community standard. Don't be mean about it, be respectful, and tell them why you won't sow or res them. Always be respectful, because these are human beings on the other side of the keyboard. But realize that as a community, the majority of players have adhered to and supported the KGC rules, including the people who have gone on CoG planes and dragon raids. For the interest of peace, I think this is one piece of passive resistance we need to enforce. <br>
<br>
As for the Uber Guild in formation, I can only laugh. <br>

<br>
Been in KGC, its affairs, its politics since its early days and I can vouch for its effectiveness and usefulness.   I am a rigid and stout supporter of KGC and the system we have built for Karana.<br>
<br>
There are wrong assumptions in many texts I see abound everywhere, ill try to post my feelings about this.<br>
<br>
KGC is not a forced stricture in the sence that it is a general assembly of leaders that choose to build something greater. KGC isnt a single guild or organisation, it is a community, a free going community that has built a functionning system for the benefit of everyone.<br>
<br>
As is, we have no rights to judge someone or an organisation that doesnt have the same beliefs we have or do not respect our organisation.<br>
<br>
As an organisation, we have two choices before us in my sence.<br>
<br>
1) Show Shattering Steel the error of their ways, show them the benefits of KGC for everyone over the FFA situation and try to live with them, of course without letting them disrupt our current organisation.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ( That is, if Shattering steel is a permanent fixture and not a Thrill of the month show for the benefit of a couple leaders ) </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  This should easily be done considering that KGC encompasses about 20 differents guilds that are functionning together.<br>
<br>
2) Ban Shattering steel completely and refuse them any help whatsoever, showing forcefully that KGC is a rigid organisation.  Organise multi-guild raids or events until the goals of Shattering steel are shown to be simply unattainable.  Mark its members as FFA and refuse them access / help in the future as a warning to others.<br>
<br>
Whatever choice KGC picks is actually up to us, Paralax will abide to the decision taken.<br>

My charector name in Nocrasim and he has lots of friends. I met a new friend today who is a member of SS, I died at the WC druid ring and he gave me a tell saying, &quot;Would you like me to exp rez you&quot;?. He was a very nice person and he seemed like a person who would be fun to talk to and hang out with. when he gave me my rez I thanked him then I sowed him. Once I had sowed him someone came up to me and said &quot;why the hell are you giving him a sow&quot;? I replyed, &quot;because he did me a favor and he is my friend&quot;. That person then made a rude gesture at me and my new friend. Do you people see what is going to happen if we outlaw theese people just becuase of a stupid guidl tag. The server will be split in two and it will no longer be good old friendly Karana, it will be 1 server 2 sides. <br>

Which one will you be on?<br>

They are not interested in a friendly Karana. They are interested in filling their own item coffers without working with other people or cooperating with others. By contesting the rotations and scheduling that ALL planar capable guilds on the server have adhered to for almost 2 years, they are bucking a system that the majority of the community supports. Whether your friend knows or understands this, I don't know. It's not personal to him, or at least it shouldn't be. But as long as SS attempts this FFA stuff, their members will be treated in a manner fitting with the respect they have shown the rest of the server, which is nil respect. <br>

But no guild can really control the actions of another, and the only thing that can be done is for the guild leader to find the name of that individual and have a talk with them, perhaps even kicking them out of the guild if the offense is serious enough.  But people are people, not machines and their individual actions cannot be centrally controlled.<br>
<br>
And as individuals most of us have no problems with people in Shattering Steel.  The problem is that the guild has decided to declare war on the rest of the server.  You talk about the server splitting, I ask you who caused the split to happen?  Who was the ones who decided to stop respecting the time of the rest of the people who play on Karana?  As Haemish says, the rotation system is all about respect.  Perhaps this does not yet impact upon you.  Perhaps you are not high enough to take on the Dragons or Planes.  But one day you will be, and FFA will only hurt you.  And remember, Karana has a large Asian and European contingent.  Under and FFA scenario, most large rotational targets would be dead before most of us in the US even got off work after a server patch.  <br>
<br>
For the last 2 years the rotation system has kept Karana peaceful, it has served the common good and all the players on it.  Each guild and alliance respects the rights of the other and this respect transfers on down.  It is still in effect.  Do you really believe that Valoran or GH needs KGC?  FFA would suit their needs better.  They could care less for the most part since other than the occasional rotational large target KGC no longer affects them much.  The large Uber guilds have nothing to lose, and everything to gain under FFA.  But they support KGC because it helps the smaller guilds and gives them equal chances with the larger guilds.  You want to see what FFA is all about, go to almost any other server and ask 100 random 50+ players how they like Fear or Hate.  Unless they are in an large guild, they probably have never been there because they cant get in.  And by large I'm talking 100+ members mostly above 50.<br>
<br>
No matter how many good deeds individual members of SS may do, no matter how nice some of them may be, they are supporting a guild that is hurting the entire server.  From the level1 newbie who doesnt understand what all the shouts are about to the level60 who is getting trained in Fear because of the KSing going on.  It isnt about sides or a stupid guild tag.  Its about preserving a balance that has made Karana unique.  SS has brought the situation down on themselves, they have refused to talk to anyone about their position, and continue to try to cause trouble.  The real victims are people like you Rush who are caught in the middle, and the small and medium sized guilds and alliances that can lose access to the high level encounters in the game.  The losers if the server goes FFA arent some nameless faceless Uber entity out there.  The losers will be you Rush, me, Haemish, Zatriz, the newbie next to you, and all the lower level players who will not get to the Planes, or have the rush of getting the killing blow on Naggy.  It isnt about sides so much as respect and doing the right thing.<br>
