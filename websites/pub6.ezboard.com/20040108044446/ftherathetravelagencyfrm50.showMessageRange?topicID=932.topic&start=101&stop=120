<br>
Its been said over and over why anyone outside the planes doesnt need access. They dont know what we are discussing at all and more than likely we will only confuse them more than help them. <br>
<br>
On top of this we will have threads appear in the public sections about how we are doing rotations with suggestions and other things (100% guaranteed) which we really dont need. Yeah i could ignore them when they happen but why should i have to? <br>
<br>
Any guild that kills RZ and gets into the planes really has more than enough time to catch up on the threads anyways. There are only like 5 with max 7 responses on each. And there are only like 6 of us that talk on them. Why we need this forum is exactly this. Not all of us can get on at the same time in game. This forum allows us to discuss things back and forth in a faster fashion then sitting around weeks waiting on all 4 guild reps/leaders to be online at the same time.<br>
<br>
The conspiracy theory thing is getting old, as you know nothing about how the rotations set in place protect this server obviously. If we wanted to keep the little guys down I can tell you for fact we wouldnt have given Tindi 8-10 straight days at RZ. Nor would Tindi and BotS have given NB that same generosity. But yeah we want to keep everyone else out of the planes. <br>
<br>
In closing why dont you give all of us a very good reason why you need to read those forums other than you are on our server and have rights blah blah blah. I'd like to see a resounding reason why you need to read that forum that would move us all to your side. Yeah my explanations arent going to change yours cause they didnt in the first 5 pages, so we have an impasse. <br>
<br>
Oh and there really is an RTA channel in game, i guess you all should be in there also. Since we all pay the same and its the &quot;RTA&quot;. You would find that that channel is also boring as hell for the most part, except for when i mistell shit in there or Vincecross, karadin, emil and Jlxaac mischannel /cyber<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aesclepiustiberinus>Aesclepius Tiberinus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/13/03 12:06 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.in-ta.net/info/aesculapius/aesc_ani.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elemental planes forum</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I guess were done.

Don't think for one second that you didn't bring this upon yourself. If there was less bitching and more discussing in the first place, perhaps it would have turned out differently.<br>

<br>
All the admins save Rogg, belong to guilds which are in the elemental planes. Coincidence, Conspiracy, whatever, it's true. I'd be willing to bet Rogg has had no part in &quot;rule making&quot; for the elemental planes procedure, as he and his guild have not reached them. I'd also be willing to bet the other admins had a part in the &quot;rule making&quot; for the elemental planes, because *gasp* they are in guilds that have reached and/or passed the elemental planes. <br>
<br>
Now, there is a very simple chain of logic for the above stated. If you have reached the elemental planes, you get to give input about the happenings in them. If you have not reached the elemental planes, your input is not based on any practical experience which would contribute in a constructive manner to the discussion about the happenings in them.<br>
<br>
There almost certainly was no aspect of &quot;keeping the little guys down&quot;, before this topic was started. The paranoid conspiracy theorists which brought this on will bear the full brunt of their actions when they are attempting to break into the elemental planes and have a rough go of dealing with the guilds already present who had to remove their discussion of said planes. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=43131">Venerable Aesclepius Tiberinus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Alinor's Big Stick</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Archon ub...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.clanbashemded.org"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.clanbashemded.com/images/clan2.jpg" style="border:0;height:75;width:300;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
No.  What assures this is that we go out and tackle the mobs before anyone else gets around to it.  Just for comparison, FK is a counter example to your paranoia.  A year ago, I couldn't tell you what FK was doing on any given day.  Tonight, they were in PoEa.  If the rotation system was this vast conspiracy to keep folks down and to keep status quo, FK wouldn't be anywhere near where they are today.<br>
<br>
As far as why the rotations were started to begin with, it was because BotS and KEG almost had a bunch of folks banned over Trakanon once (yes, a GM was there and had to mediate the situation).  Rather than risk being banned and such, we decided to start up a rotation.  BotS and SoT saw what it was like to race to mobs and how nasty it could get as well.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;enforcing&quot; anything, the only thing we have is the social contract of the rotations.  You start being a dink and you get a lot of bad press and you look like asses.<br>
<br>
The rest of this thread is full of unfounded paranoia.  From past experience, the only result of making that forum public would be to produce lots of comments from folks like some of those who posted in this thread who have no current vested interest in the matters at hand.  This would prove to be nothing but a distraction to everyone who reads these boards.  Personally, I don't have access to those boards and honestly don't care what goes on there.  I trust those who do have access to work things out.<br>
<br>
The question is:<br>
<br>
What is to be gained from opening the forum to the public?<br>
<br>
We already know what will be the detriment of opening the forum. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=liviusmaximus>LiviusMaximus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>SotE - GL</span><br>  Posts: 406<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/13/03 1:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elemental planes forum</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No. What assures this is that we go out and tackle the mobs before anyone else gets around to it.

<br>
BotS was able to tackle those mobs before anyone else because other guilds weren't capable at the time of defeating them.  The 2nd guild in VT didn't want to violate the RTA and agreed to do VT every other spawn, not race BotS and possibly beat them to the punch every week.  If they had then they could have been much better equipped when PoP came out and been able to defeat the PoP mobs faster than what they did.  In situations like this the rotation system does help BotS.<br>
<br>
No, I'm not paranoid.  I am a supporter of the rotation system.  I'm also a realist and see how helps both the small and large guilds.  I know that it helps to keep the status quo, but it doesn't prevent the status quo from changing.  The best example of that is my guild.  A year ago SotE didn't even exist, yet now we are where we are.  The current system doesn't maintain the status quo, but I don't see how you can deny that it does help it to remain fairly stable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brainquake>BrainQuake</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/13/03 1:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elemental planes forum</span><hr size=1> I never post here, but I can't keep silent any longer.<br>
<br>
Rotations are gimp. I think many of you are deceived when you think that the top three guilds can take on everything in a FCFS world and cockblock the mid-ranged AND smaller guilds. Its simply about time management. The biggest guilds arent going to run around velious knocking off all the mobs to keep everybody down. THEY CANT, and if they try they wont be one of the biggest guilds for long. No one on our server has completed the Plane of Time, why is BOTS going to give a crap about who is farming NTOV? Are they going to rush in and kill all the NTOV dragons? I think they have their hands full as-is...<br>
<br>
Rotations actually cause unnecessary killing of mobs by overlypowerful guilds. Half the guilds on alot of rotations only kill them because its &quot;their turn&quot; to do it. Good lord if a guild has that big of a hard-on for Statue BP's let them kill it a couple of times in a row, then they will never bother you again about killing him for two reasons. They dont need the loot anymore, and no guild likes to do the same shit all the time. I'd love to see these perma-killers after a couple weeks. <br>
I bet your guild will have really great attendance on the 20th completion of the Bertox event in a row.<br>
<br>
I've talked to many people in game as well, there are far more people than you think that have strong dislike with the rotations on this server. The support is only THAT strong with people who read these boards. &quot;If you don't like it then leave the server&quot;. Well I, like many didn't know what I was stepping into when I randomly chose the Rathe server and I'm not going to pay money to lose all my gear and transfer. People join a guild, become fond of it, and do what is necessary to support their guild, even following all the RTA rules. <br>
<br>
Racing is part of the EQ experience, and your gimping it by playing it this way. I think of it like playing Mortal Kombat with 2 controllers with nobody playing the 2nd person. <br>
<br>
Someone said previously that there is a problem with 16 guilds on a rotation of a 7-day spawn, but yet there is no solution... Make all the mobs FCFS... The smallest guilds only get loot from rotation mobs sometimes once in 3 months because the rotations are so long. In a race situation at least they decide their own fate. If they are fast they can get loot and progress. If they are slow they won't ever get loot, their guild will fall apart and the members will have to join bigger guilds. Less guilds on the server to compete for content.<br>
<br>
I know this sounds bad for the small/slow guy, but think about the small/fast guilds. They have no way to progress in a decent manner. Once they join rotations they get to kill the mob once a month if their lucky. The only way to progress further is by farming mobs. You can't expect to get too far if your guild is wearing all bazaar gear. It doesn't matter if uber guild XYZ can kill a certain rot mob really fast or with 20 people. I know plenty of small guilds who can get their 35 people to a mob in the blink of an eye with good teamwork and kill the same mob. Small guilds should be allowed to kill more raid mobs than once a month if they are fast enough. An upcoming guild trying to get a Statue BP for their MT shouldn't have to wait 4 months or whatever for a shot at one if they are fast enough. Why should they be forced to give slow_poke_guild_01 a chance to kill it because they are both on the rotation. The fast/small guild could have already been to statue and got him dead while the slow guild is still waiting on more members at kael entrance. Racing is the solution, it makes it a game again, you win by being fast.<br>
<br>
And yes, if you are a very very very slow guild you can most likely get on any rotation. Look at the Rotation Requests page, many of them include (thanks to GUILD XYZ for the shot). That leaves the slow guild all the time in the world to kill the mob because anyone else capable has already killed the said mob and is already on the rotation and are not allowed to kill. <br>
<br>
Rotations cause the possibility of one guild being up for 5-6 mobs at once. Why is that fair? Lets assume all the capable guilds are already on these rotations, then they have no competition. Why shouldn't one of the other guilds be allowed to kill some of those mobs again instead of having an xp night while one guild gets the raid action.  I have had many xp nights when we could have killed a mob, but weren't allowed to because its a rotation mob. While another guild who is up for 5 other things goes through taking their good old slow time killing them all night long.<br>

How do you think it is on other servers? The big 1 or 2 guilds kill what they want to kill, and the rest of the server gets to have the scraps when the more powerful guilds no longer have interest and move on.  My point was you would have access to Mob X only when the big dogs were done with it.  You don't have that on The Rathe.  <br>

AoW is a good example that lots of guilds, even big ones, still have interest in, yet anyone who can kill it gets to share.

The gap between the haves and have nots would be a lot more pronounced.  It is the very rotation system that Lukiebb is blasting that has enabled so many guilds, including his own (and mine!), to be able to progress.<br>

Also, you say this gimps the EQ experience.  That is certainly a valid opinion, but it sort of boggles me that people who choose to continue playing on this server do so with the belief that the rotation system is an evil bureaucracy put in place to keep the little man down, as some others who posted on this thread seem to think.

That would mean the WE, the ONLY european guild on this server, would get all the mobs we wanted/were able to kill untill you guys are out of work/class whatever. By the time you get home, we go to bed. And by that time we could have blown  for example all HOH trials, or Behemoth or Carprin ring or Bertoxx ring. Behemoth and HoH trials take  a day to reset, so we could do it again the next day. Carprin and Bertoxx take ~6 hours to reset so you would have to wait till midnight your time to have it repop and attempt it.<br>
Granted, we could not kill every mob, but blowing events is easy. Just trigger it and leave. And meanwhile we kill the mobs that we think are worth killing, so you will not see any of it untill we are done with it.<br>

The euro guild problem wouldn't be much of a problem, maybe only on server resets. But what makes you think that everything spawns in the middle of the night EST? Under normal circumstances the only reason you would be getting more content is that the percentage of mobs popping in the middle of the night would only be shared by one guild.<br>
<br>
Also, why do you think all the guilds are going to turn dickhead without rotations. Carprin and Bertox are not on rotation but guilds for sure do take turns on them. Sharing isn't bad but i'd hate to see a rotation on caprin 10 guilds long because thats about how many could complete the cycle.

Seriously though, there is a problem now that 16 guilds are on some of the old velious mobs.  King Tormax and Rallos Zek are the 2 that first come to mind.  In my opinion, after enough people get the ability to kill said mob, it should become FFA.  If your guild can't get at least 1 kill in per 3 1/2 months of an FFA, you don't deserve to be on any kind of rotation anyways.  Having a rotation that is borderline 4 months of time between kills, is utterly ridiculous.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://personal.bgsu.edu/~jford/lukiebshort5803.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
So.... informal sharing works just fine but formal sharing is teh suck?  As many have said though (and is quite evident if you look on the server), Bertox isn't that great of an encounter.  Eventually you'll get the flags you need and (almost) never do the encounter again.  For example, BotS has not killed a flag mob lower than RZtW in a very long time.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I was inferring if there were no rotations a big guild couldn't stop one like VOLS from killing at least something because they simply don't have the time to do all the content at the SAME TIME.&quot;<br>
<br>
With PoP, it doesn't matter about all those other mobs in the high end game.  Only one really matters - RZtW.  Just as in Luclin it was the Emperor in Ssra.<br>
<br>
As far as killing mobs on rotation simply because you are up for it: I don't know about other guilds, but BotS surely does not do this (I can tell you when the last time we had a raid outside of PoP was if you want).  As far as the logic about letting one guild have a go at it until they are tired, we have covered this many, many times.  In quick summary:<br>
<br>
1) people who post that this will work tend to think that their guild will be the one that will win all the races until they are tired of killing the mob (and not be the one that has to watch 5 other guilds take all the kills for the next 6 months while they won't get it at all).<br>
2) Some guilds, as someone posted, may decide they are never through with the mob, but can win the races a good portion of the time.<br>
3) Greatly enables cockblocking.  Sure, you couldn't cockblock all things but you could cockblock the most important things to your guild, for example, RZtW.<br>
<br>
As far as the argument about not moving to another server, the only real argument is that your friends may be on this server.  Any other part of the game can be regained/replaced and even cross-server tells can help keep in contact with friends.  The only thing you wouldn't be able to do is play directly with them.  Complaining about equipment and such is just so you can bitch/whinge and keep posting about how downtrodden you are on this server.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Having a rotation that is borderline 4 months of time between kills, is utterly ridiculous.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not necessarily, if there's enough content to fill up the 4 months other than that (that's a whole different discussion).  Why is it so important to kill Tormax, for example?  There are easier mobs with better loot elsewhere (BoT has plenty of them).  Why not skip Tormax and do something else?  or is it because you somehow feel you *must* farm Tormax until everyone in the guild has a Horn for every twink?  Maybe the solution is to kill him a time or two so you can pat yourself on the back for a job well done and then go do other stuff for a while, then *maybe* come back to Tormax.  Another solution is maybe that all the folks who are still killing on the three prongs of Velious to discuss among themselves and divide up along the three prongs, instead of fighting all three prongs, to make the rotations of each of the bosses shorter?  Most of these posts reminds me of Beavis sticking his finger into an electrical socket over and over.<br>
<br>
I haven't looked on other servers, maybe someone else has the information and can post it.  On other servers, are there as many smaller/mid-range guilds doing content in Velious/Luclin as there are on The Rathe?  If the number of guilds is different, are the numbers of players near the same?  I have no idea... but what I would think is that there would be fewer guilds killing Tormax, for instance, on other servers but those guilds will be larger.  I would think that other servers requires even the smaller guilds to be larger than the ones on The Rathe simply so folks can experience the content in the game.  I would also think that other servers smaller/mid-range guilds see more turnover than those on The Rathe.  I may be wrong, but that's what I'd predict.  Maybe someone could post information along those lines so we could see. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grommofbots>Gromm of BotS</A> at: 8/13/03 8:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baysarfk>BaysarFK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 173<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/13/03 8:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Elemental planes forum</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For example, BotS has not killed a flag mob lower than RZtW in a very long time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Small guilds are going to be out there watching with trackers for these mobs to pop because they actually NEED them. Heck, if someone from BOTS decided they needed Tormax boots that bad (yeah right) then why shouldn't they be allowed to kill him once in a while, but I think they might get suprised how hard a fight they would get racing to it from a guild who survives on such loot. Uber guilds might notice a mob like this after its been up a while undisturbed, in which case why not kill it, but guilds who need the loot will make sure they die in a timely fashion I am sure. <p>&lt;b&gt;Brainquake Jawbreaker&lt;br&gt;<br>
