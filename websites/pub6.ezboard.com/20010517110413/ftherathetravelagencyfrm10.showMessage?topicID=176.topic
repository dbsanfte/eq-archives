The various arguments from all sides has been well thought out and I commend you all no matter what side of the fence you may stand on. Today the honorable and my friend Edwina has suggested that a vote be taken regarding the various plans that have arisen regarding the Indy/FFA plane days. I find my self with a few questions left before I can cast my all important vote. ( this past November has taught us all the importance of our votes)<br>
<br>
Let me review the facts as I see them, all the information or my conclusion as to what is fact has been derived from this board. Bare with me as I reiterate what I am sure is all common knowledge to you all, but I want to be sure that the foundation from which I draw my questions and or conclusions is indeed the true absolute by which I am taking it for.<br>
<br>
<br>
1. There is 5 epic guilds/alliances that have proven themselves as under the guidelines established on this board and have been recognized as such. These are the leaders of the Rathe, the trail blazers, the so called umber guilds.I commend you on your accomplishments and tip my hat to you all. Because these guilds/alliances have proven themselves, they own the rights to the epic MOBS of the planes and all the bounty that goes with the kill. In return they have agreed that the normal loot of the planes is not theirs  and belongs to the  guild/alliance camping the plane that day.<br>
<br>
2. There is 25 entities that have satisfied the requirements established by this board and the community at large that supports it, so therefore they have gained the right to post to the schedule and reserve dates for hunting the planes. These guilds/alliances are the meat and potatoes of the Rathe. These guilds/alliances are after the  normal loot in the planes, again great job, you have come a long way baby as the saying goes.<br>
<br>
3. There is an unknown number of guilds/alliances that have yet to satisfy the posting requirements for reserving days in the planes, but have the will and or talent to actually do the planes if they could book a day without violating the all ready established rules and regulations governing such. These folks are every bit as talented as posting or epic guilds but lack the numbers to share calendar. It may be because they like it that way, or are slowly growing towards the goal of becoming a posting entity.<br>
<br>
4. There is untold number unguilded folks that lack the organization structure (a guild) to satisfy posting requirements to utilize the plane calendar. These folks are the unguilded friends of you all, most have been on raids already, been invited by you all, but because of guild hierarchy most likely are missing a few pieces of that armor we all are chasing.<br>
<br>
5. there is on average 30 days in a month.<br>
<br>
6. there is 3 planes this board is concerned with right now.<br>
<br>
these are the pertinent facts as I see them, I hope I have got them correct if not enlighten me. Now to the questions that I need answered before I cast the all mighty vote.<br>
<br>
1. if the 5 epic guilds are chasing the epic MOBS why are they  part of the 25 that have posting rights to the normal mobs? isn't it better to have 30 days of gods split 5 ways? seems to me you all would have your epic stuff real quick.<br>
<br>
2 If there is 20-25 guilds/alliances with posting  rights and 30 days in a month isn't 3  plane raids a month enough? Isn't it better to have 1 day a month per plane to call your own and allow you to plan accordingly?<br>
<br>
3. With the 5 days left in a 30 day calendar why not give 4 of these to the smaller guilds to plan there own raids and  posting requirements ?<br>
<br>
4 How about 1 day per month for FFA in the planes only requirement no guild tags?<br>
<br>
That is all I hope I have not misunderstood all the good people on the Rathe as formulated these questions in my head maybe they have been answered already and I apologize in advance, if not enlighten me<br>

These are all fine and great questions.  I would suggest going through the pages of this forum beyond the first and reading all the nonsense everyone (including me) has written about this.<br>
<br>
I don't mean to try and shut you down, but this issue has been argued unto death at this point by all concerned.  But to quickly address what I see as your major salient points:<br>
<br>
1 - the 'epic' guilds are in the planes rotation like everyone else because there are items they need (some pieces of planar, non-god epic, etc), and because they take up friends/acquaintences on raids.  This gives them the same basic 'chance' at a god as anyone else.  The gods are not strictly reserved for the big brother guilds, they are simply there as people to be called up when another raid is incapable of taking down the god.<br>
<br>
2 - There are 25 posting entities now.  That means there is only a cushion of 5 days a month which aren't auto-reserved, basically.   Taking into account that raids in Sky are both expensive and time-consuming, and you really only have 2 planes that are raided daily.  Your suggestion to open these 'free' remaining 5 days for non-eligible guilds has 2 problems.<br>
a - Do you remove these 5 days when another 5 guilds or alliances become large enough to gain posting rights?  There is no exit strategy here.  You are assuming a static # of planes-capable posting entities, which is simply not the case.<br>
b - Who chooses which 5 small guilds or alliances get to post?  who sets it up? who runs this calendar?  Do you put a lower number for requirements?  Then you get into the exact same argument from people with 15 people who think you're holding them down by requiring 18 planes-capable people.<br>
<br>
This does not solve anything.<br>
<br>
3 - Making the FFA day with a requirement of 'no guild tags' is going against the supposed point of the indi/FFA day in the first place.  The original problem according to those who claim to be most desirous of a non-calendar run day is to allow independent, non guilded players and SMALL GUILDS a chance to do the planes.  Also of note is that it is painfully easy to go /anon, or deguild for a day or two.  And in a FFA situation, who is going to monitor it?  I'm not going to care.  I doubt any calendar admins would either.<br>
<br>
Again, I don't mean to come off sounding utterly mean or uninterested in what you're saying.  It's just that we've been over this about one thousand times at this point, and we've even compromised to the point of voting (successfully, it appears, but time will tell) to establish a non-calendar-run date for each plane every month.  None of the people that originally worked on the system as it stands right now think it's a good idea.  I'd be willing to bet most people voting for it think it will be disastrous.<br>
<br>
But hey, enough people seem to think that they have a god-given right to visit the planes (because $9.89!!!), that this compromise is a way of creating a situation where nobody loses, and everybody wins a little bit.<br>
<br>
But 5 days of 'reserved' dates for people who can't be bothered to get 40 people together to form an alliance? AND a FFA day as well?  I wouldn't support that if you paid me.<br>

/kisses the dorfs pointed head<br>
<br>
Thanks for stopping by and bringing these well thought out questions and perceptions.  I'll try to answer what I can, and if I make mistakes or omit something, I am <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> sure</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that someone will point that out &lt;grins&gt;<br>
<br>
First to your conclusion #1.  The Epic guilds (those 5 &quot;uber&quot; guilds you mentioned) are guilds/alliances (in the case of FoR) that have proven to the community that they have the gumption and ability to take down the harder mobs that drop epic pieces (mobs like VS and such).  They do not have exclusive rights to epic drops, but they are on call for those folks in plane raids to call upon if they are unable to handle taking down the god.  For their service in this assistance, they have agreed to leave all but the epic loot to the others who reserved the plane.<br>
<br>
Question #1:  The Epic guilds/alliances still have some members, or many members, in need of planer armor; therefore, they still have posting rights on the calendar, in addition to being on-call (as stated above).<br>
<br>
Question #2:  Not sure exactly what you mean, hon.<br>
<br>
Question #3:  While there may only be 20-25 posting entities currently, unless the Rathe gets a split lowering the high-level characters drastically, we foresee more and more posting entities...which will lengthen the time between raids.  The current proposal for FFA/Indy days is at 1 day per month for non-posting entities to have fun in Fear and Hate.  The proposal is to get this FFA day, with the idea that the number of days could be adjusted according to usage.<br>
<br>
Question #4:  Limiting those in the plane on FFA day to unguilded?  It's a possibility; however, I foresee those small guilds raising a fit about it, which is why it is proposed to be non-posting guilds/unguilded peeps.<br>
<br>
I do hope this answers your questions effectively.  If not, let us know and I'll get someone else to explain/answer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
question 2 regarding the 25 guilds with posting rights at this writing, these guilds/alliances have at least 40 toons plane ready, or to put it another way these are the 25 biggest guild/alliances on the server and one day per month  plane reservation per guild/alliance  is fair to these 25 entities for achieving such status 5 days for everyone else per month doesn't sound outrageous to me, the posting  requirements would just be the 25  biggest guilds/alliances receive one day per month per plane as counted by those that are keeping track now. would be no different than it is now except the guild count would be finite and the entities may change as  guilds grow, shrink or form alliance.<br>
<br>
question 3: 4 days left would be allocated to a different board for all other guilds/alliance and rules associated with that schedule I imagine would not be much different than rules associated with this schedule.<br>

<br>
Im really not that sure about this statement.  Yes there are some guilds that do not meet the 40 requirement that could clear a plance, but I doubt it is very many.  5 maybe?  10 at the most.<br>
<br>
You also left out guilds that can not handle the planes.  A minor point =)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 6. there is 3 planes this board is concerned with right now.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
True, but Sky is handled differently.  You can have 2 day raids, and no body reservers anything but the weekends.  While you can clear Fear in 4 hours and Hate in 6, Sky is a multi 12 hour-day event.<br>
<br>
So basically its easier to just focus on the 2 &quot;normal&quot; planes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1. if the 5 epic guilds are chasing the epic MOBS why are they part of the 25 that have posting rights to the normal mobs?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As other have said, because they still do need the normal armor drops from the planes.  FoR (the most extreme example) has like 120+ planesable characters.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> isn't it better to have 30 days of gods split 5 ways? seems to me you all would have your epic stuff real quick.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, not sure if I read your question right, but it seems like you think he gods are always up.  They are not.  Gods are on a 7 day respawn timer.  So Gods are up only once a week, unless the server goes down (crash or reboot).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2 If there is 20-25 guilds/alliances with posting rights and 30 days in a month isn't 3 plane raids a month enough?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
For some it more than enough.  For others that have more members it is not =).  And really its only 2 raids per month, plus Sky every 2-3 months.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Isn't it better to have 1 day a month per plane to call your own and allow you to plan accordingly?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Umm, this is how it is handled now.  Except its not per month, but per rotation.  Which is very close to a month long atm.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 3. With the 5 days left in a 30 day calendar why not give 4 of these to the smaller guilds to plan there own raids and posting requirements ?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Because there is not always 5 days left over.  And there will not always be 25 posting entities.  Every week it seems a new entity is added.  New alliances are formed, or guilds finally hit the 40 mark and they start posting thier dates.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> question 2 regarding the 25 guilds with posting rights at this writing, these guilds/alliances have at least 40 toons plane ready, or to put it another way these are the 25 biggest guild/alliances on the server and one day per month plane reservation per guild/alliance is fair to these 25 entities for achieving such status 5 days for everyone else per month doesn't sound outrageous to me, the posting requirements would just be the 25 biggest guilds/alliances receive one day per month per plane as counted by those that are keeping track now. would be no different than it is now except the guild count would be finite and the entities may change as guilds grow, shrink or form alliance.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Seems like a lot of hassle to me.  <br>
CalendarAdmin: Ok guild X how many people do you have this week?<br>
GuildXGM: 56<br>
CalendarAdmin: Ok, you have the 18th higher count, you can continuing posting.<br>
<br>
The 40 rule is easy.  No variable members counts, etc.<br>
<br>

<br>
Who would Admin this board?  <br>
<br>
And as I have stated above, I reallly don't think there are that many guilds on the Rathe that can handle a plane on thier own that do not already have posting access.  <br>
<br>

<br>
How I wish I could believe that myself.  But I do not.  If people can cheat the system, they will.   <br>
<br>
Many of the changes to the calender were because of past abuses to that calendar.<br>
