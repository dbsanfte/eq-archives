Wuwu.<br>
Just what I wanted.  MORE bloody exp.  The hope - the one little hope i had of one day making 60 - is now pretty much gone.  I have school to attend to.  I have friends.  Surprisingly enough, there's life outside Everquest (No matter how much I furvently try and deny it) and it's now just beginning to drag.<br>
<br>
What were Verant exactly trying to do?<br>
They've been obviously trying to appeal to the new players, thus making the younger levels much easier, and yet they seem to be intent on shafting the higher level community that has swelled over the last years.  I used to enjoy the 40's to early 50's...it was decent exp, you had to put <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> time</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> into it, but it wasn't the kind of exp that you'd go on for 3 hours and look back, and have 3 blues.  Nowadays i'll sit there plowing away in FG and find, egads, half a blue.<br>
<br>
Now, don't try and say &quot;@#%$ you bog, that's lame, we all have to do that blah blah want the game easier go play diablo,&quot; as a matter of fact, i <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> did</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> play Diablo, but that's another point entirely.  I don't see why Verant want to stop people rushing to 60 and thus be able to even get into guilds that will let them access this high level content.  It's a bloody joke that they expect people to have to put...what...40 hours into a level? Kalessin told me that it took him a solid 10, maybe 11 hours to get one yellow - he may of been exagerating a bit, but I was shocked in the way that it seemed plausible.<br>
<br>
Why do Verant want to keep taking away the fun? These punitive patches are just ruining the game and going to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> lose them money</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Newer players will be turned away once they chat to a higher level and get told of the unfathomable hours of slogging away just to finish that blue/yellow.  AA was reasonable, but now they've slowed that down too.  What in the hell are they doing? My point is, the more they punish, the more they lose.  And they keep on a-punishin' :/ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uphalynk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phalynk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/6/02 11:54:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   RE:</span><hr size=1> Stylina not sure if you were talking about me or elysiana. But I guess I shall try to speak for us both since we are both druids and are pretty much trying to point out the same thing. Where maybe elysiana may be content with quading all the way up to 60 which was possible prior to the recent patch and which is still possible after this patch but is 33% more harder to do. Others choose to join grps.<br>
<br>
Whether she or I choose to solo to 60 or aaxp to 100 is are own perogative. It would be very boring but to each his own=). I for one actually like to grp but I dont like the time it takes me to find a grp. When I'm on a raid with my guild and I have c3 I'm a very accomplished healer even. But no way near to a clerics lvl. And I dont have the mana nor the spells to keep my grp alive when things start getting icky.<br>
<br>
I ask you this stylina lets just say that VI doesnt release the heal spells. Then what are druids to do? I'm sure you could care less but this is what I and many others have to worry about. Everything would have been just dandy if VI had placed the heal spells in the patch but they didn't. So who knows for how long the druid class will be unbalanced. Unbalanced in a way that we can nolonger efficiently solo, no one cares for us in a grp unless its a guild grp. What more can I say.<br>
<br>
Many druids were pretty much casual players that liked to log on for acouple hrs here and there and get exp. Hmm I guess VI only wants its players to be power gamers and for that I just don't have the time for. <br>

<br>
I was under the impression that they were moving exp out of 59 and 54 and sticking them in the levels below them.  That would make the exp needed to level a more smoother transition.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
On &quot;Penalty Level&quot; Rebalancing (Levels 51, 54, and 59): <br>
<br>
- Many people saw much smaller experience gains at level 60. This was due to the &quot;penalty level&quot; rebalancing effect more than anything that was done to NPC experience values. <br>
<br>
- In the previous patch, Level 60 became a full level, when it had been half a half level the day before. <br>
<br>
- &quot;Penalty levels&quot; have once again been rebalanced such that level 60 is much closer to the half level that it was before, and experience was instead redistributed throughout the earlier levels. <br>
<br>
- The penalty effect is still mostly mitigated, however the distribution should be more fair to those who are already level 60, yet do not have a full bar in that level. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm assuming they mean &quot;hell levels&quot; and not &quot;penalty levels&quot;.<br>
The levels listed in the patch message are hell levels.<br>
<br>
Hell Level: A level requireing more exp then average to get thru.<br>
<br>
Penalty Level: A level following a hell level.  You lose more exp on average becuase the exp you lose is based on the exp you needed to get on the previous level.<br>
<br>
For example, 59 is a hell level becuase it takes forever to get thru.   60 is a penalty level becuase you lose over 3 blues of exp when you die.<br>
<br>
I personally don't think any level 60 will complain about not getting much exp to put into level 60.  Level 60s don't need to level, becuase they can't anymore.  The only exp they need in level 60 is buffer exp.<br>
<br>
It sounds like they are doing their exp rebalancing calculations based on the beginning of level 50 to the end of 60, when they should be doing it on the beginning of level 50 to the beginning of level 60. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uelysianaheathertoes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ElysianaHeathertoes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/6/02 7:07:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=725.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hmm</span><hr size=1> Looks like VI had a chance to think about it, and gave us back some of the xp on lower lvl mobs, and seem to have worked out the resist trouble a little.

Neither. (well, both)  It was directed at druids in general, most specifically the ones who complained about how soloing wasn't worth it and they didn't have any group effectiveness and are now complaining when they nerf soloing and added group effectiveness. (though, soloing is no longer nerfed and the new CH's aren't live yet)<br>

It's now back to the way it was pre-patch.  You can solo just as easily as you always could.  Now, players simply get rewarded for taking risks. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

<br>
The agro increasing and decreasing spells are extremly useful in both xping in difficult locations and on raids.  <br>
<br>
On a raid, keeping agro buff on the MT means that other classes can do more damage without gaining agro, and by having a second enchanter cast on the next tank in the switch occasionally, tank switches become much more smooth.  In single group action, agro buff cast before tashing/slowing can and will save your ass (A good example is camping key parts in ssra).<br>
<br>
The deagro buff is very useful to be cast on a wizards.  It gives them a roughly 20% ability to nuke more (actually 1-[.9/1.1]), which in a 15 minute fight such as THO can result in a huge increase in damage output.<br>
<br>
Also, from what I've heard reported, the new sk agro spells affect the rampage list as well as the agro list.  That 6% increase can mean a huge difference on a mob like Arch Lich Rhag'Zhadune.<br>

<br>
This hasn't really been an issue for us in NB- course, nearly all our warrior mains have bocs. We usually only lose melee when they get riposted below 40% or didn't put the proc'ing weapon away, (in which case the problem is with the melee who got killed, not the MT's performance) or after the MT died and the next tank hasn't gotten aggro yet. (I've thrown an aggro buff or two around in these situations, but my initial reaction was that it didn't help much)  This may change in the future, but with our current raids, aggro buffs are fairly redundant.<br>
<br>
In xp groups, while it would be nice to help the tank get aggro faster, I just don't have enough spell slots, and the fact that I have to recast it before every fight definitely reduces its effectiveness.<br>
<br>
I wasn't aware of how the aggro spells interacted with rampage- looks promising, though I'm somewhat wary of casting aggro increasing buffs on anyone but the MT. (although, watching bards and ranjurs die from rampage is lots of fun, and I wouldn't want to lose such pure glee on raids <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Also, in my experience, wizards are more limited by their manapools and/or the duration of the fight than by aggro.  Coordinating your chanters and wizards together to get a smooth aggro reduction buff working is more trouble than I'm willing to go through.  Maybe in the future, (ie, when NB gets enough emp keys, though I imagine we'll aim the aggro reduction buffs at clerics rather than wizzies...) but at this point, we gain too little benefit from it.<br>
<br>
That being said, I use the self-only aggro reduction buff religiously before tashing on raid mobs, and have put a few AA points into the innate aggro reduction. (slightly OT- do the aggro reduction buffs and AA skills stack?) <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
