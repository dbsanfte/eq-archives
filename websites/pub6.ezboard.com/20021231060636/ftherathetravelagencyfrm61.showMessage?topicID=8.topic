<br>
We will be changing Slay Undead in two ways.<br>
The ability will now be activated by a button. You will be able to turn it on and off as you see fit. The drawback is that using this ability requires the attention and intense focus of the Paladin. His intensity leaves him vulnerable to attacks, while inspiring the undead to greater strength. Strikes made against the Paladin using Slay Undead will do more damage than they usually do.<br>
<br>
******************************************<br>
<br>
Well so much for that AA ability, the only reason I was going to get it was so I could solo more efficiantly.  slay undead 3 only increases the dmg output of a paladin by 15% or so against an undead mob, so if im taking &quot;more&quot; damage whats the point?<br>
<br>
I would be willing to bet the &quot;more&quot; damage we end up taking will be &quot;more&quot; then the increase of damage we do against undead.<br>
<br>
Sigh.<br>
<br>
You rangers should probably expect the same thing to happen to your archery AA ability as well.  <br>
<br>
They take power away only to give it back with &quot;new and improved AA abilities&quot; in this new expansion.  What a crock of BULL SHIT.<br>

I been playing hard trying to accomplish SU3. I am un0sure in which direction to go if any atm now. <br>
GRRR You know there was a post on Dp corner that made the most sense. <br>
Why not take away Duel wield for Warriors and make it only live NPC damage efficiant, Or Assassinate for rogues, even Mend and FD for monks. Kill Bows for Ranger. Damn while we at it lets just drop the damn servers and tell everyone to buy PoP or EQ2 so we can wake up and find such wonderful rewards for all the hard work we put into our Characters.......<br>
<br>
<br>
MY Post to PN for Absur I Would urge all Paladins to post there objections if any...<br>
<br>
What VI do? Hire a Consultant-Kid-Grandpa with no RPG/Fantasy folklore experience?<br>
<br>
VI. Currently at 60, the Slay Undead paladin has certainly invested a great deal of points into the power given by slay undead. This is a large and meaningful advantage for the paladin, in that it brings him up greatly in situational damage with absolutely no downside. There is nothing inherently wrong with that.<br>
<br>
Good Bullshit, Open the paragraph like Mighty mouse. You all got  “Benny hin” in the background controlling a Game stick back there? <br>
<br>
VI. The issue is that there are no amount of AAs the warrior can buy to also raise his situational damage by such a large amount. This means that before AA, the paladin is always producing somewhat less damage than a warrior; and after AA the paladin is sometimes producing as much damage as a warrior at 60th level. This problem grows more noticeably in margin post 60 and becomes an increasing issue in Planes of Power.<br>
I suppose triple attack, Duel Wielding, Disks, Rage, Furry, Ambidexterity Are considered here for Warriors?<br>
Warriors CF3 was intended to upgrade their fury. The designers could of looked at a way to increase the warrior’s benefit of this Ability. Instead of decreasing another Class main Ability. <br>
I suppose VI looked at the amount of misses a Paladin has per mob/npc? <br>
I Suppose VI looked at our USLESS discs for Paladins.<br>
I suppose VI looked at Act of Valor as a great Attribute in losing exp that we worked so hard for? Act of Valor what a joke. Act of Valor would be maximizing a max Aggression like AE Taunt to save a Raid when all Warriors are down. Not pass hitpoints. Bah what type of genius thought of this? What good is a skill that takes at least 3 seconds to target and lag threw a hotkey if you are not used to number keys. IF a tank is going down LOH will save him or it won’t we do not need two versions of LOH. <br>
I suppose VI looked at the Hybrid class of Paladins as NONE-UNDEAD fighter class. Instead VI forgot folklore. Folklore deemed that Paladins were the Undead slaying masters that lead the way over any warrior. Why not just change the foundation of what Paladins are and make a Queeradin while you are at this. We could dress the Paladin in High heels and a skirt and put him on the NORATH CAT WALK!!! Then rename this once NOBLE class FRUITADINS!!!<br>
VI. We've intentionally tried to add more undead creatures to give classes with situational advantages a place to use them. We want people to be able to make use of their anti-undead spell lines, their anti-summoned spells, and of course any specialty AAs. However, the amount of gain given by Slay Undead is too good to have no downside associated with it. Classes need to stay in relative balance with roughly equal AA expenditures.<br>
I suppose you looked at the amount SU3 goes off? I have only seen it maybe go off 15 times in a good group for ten hours straight. In Umbral on Assassins and Dark Masters. I have never seen SU3 go off with such a ferocity that would cause you to make this nerf possible. What Casting abilities Vrs Undead? OW you mean our Top Notch expel undead? Or, our new banish undead for 500+ hp on a standard 10k to 50k mob/npc. I never new a Paladin had anything except his blessed weapon and healing pray abilities. A Paladin wields a Blessed Weapon. This enables the Paladin to Venture out into the world and conquered evil. Apparently VI will have their Paladins go out into the Norath as Hussies with Wiffaball bats.<br>
<br>
VI. We like the idea of this ability from a roleplaying and a gameplay standpoint. But it needs to be altered to make it more balanced. So we’ll be making a change to Slay Undead and refunding the points for this AA ability on Monday.<br>
<br>
Why not copy Diablo? Blizzard ruined their game with the tactics you are using at the moment. By the way I left Diablo 2 when they Nerfed the Paladins and have became ANTI-BLIZZARD SOFTWARE since. I Hope you take a Severe look at your consultants Abilities on RPG projects. As, I may switch to Shadowbane or something in that area of RPG. Cancel my Accounts and kick VI to the curb like I did Blizzard. You think it is fun leveling 60 levels to get something you worked so hard for nerfed? As far as I am concerned VI Designers are noobs and your RPG ethics character development team have lost an ambition. That they had so long ago. Maybe it is time that everyone loses their Ambition in buying VI/Sony products. Move on to the new stuff that blows Everquest’s lazy development team away. How many more Classes are you going to NERF? When it happens to there class, you will learn from your mistakes and lack of funding. I am sure many have canceled accounts already. I know a few RL friends that did already. <br>
NOTE: ONCE A DESIGNER BECOMES LAZY AND LOSES HIS AMBITION THE SOFTWARE IS RUINED AND SO ARE THE OWNERS POCKETS ON THE PRODUCT!<br>
<br>
VI. NOTE: We’ve also changed the way that the refund works. Unspent AA points over 30 will only be deleted when you first zone after the patch. So you will have time to spend these points after you log in but before you zone.<br>
Yeah ok, Go LD while working on points, Die from some stupid train while working on points. Combat fury points that was a pre-requisites SU. We going to bit the big one on this too? Ok your Development team is smart, about as smart as a C minus student in a designers program.<br>
<br>
<br>
VI. We will be changing Slay Undead in two ways. <br>
The ability will now be activated by a button. You will be able to turn it on and off as you see fit. The drawback is that using this ability requires the attention and intense focus of the Paladin. His intensity leaves him vulnerable to attacks, while inspiring the undead to greater strength. Strikes made against the Paladin using Slay Undead will do more damage than they usually do.<br>
There you go again, what did you all do Hire a team from Blizzard Entertainment? Change a few things instead of Sanctify blood and loose half your life while you swing. Like having a bad case of Self-Harm Thorns. You got Creative and took away Paladin’s plate class ability and fine toned it to a Failed feign death.<br>

Rich Waters posted this Apparently. Why not Absur?<br>
<br>
Over the last day, we've received a great deal of feedback and concern over the proposed Slay Undead change. We've put a lot of thought into the issue, and decided to hold off making any changes to Slay Undead for the foreseeable future.<br>
<br>
Slay Undead will continue to work in exactly the same way, and deal the same damage it does on live servers currently, and remain at that balance through level 65. Damage caused by Slay Undead won't increase post-60, though Paladin melee damage in general will continue to rise as you level up. There will be no defense penalty imposed while using this skill.<br>
<br>
We'd like to apologize for any undue frustration this has caused you, and we appreciate the feedback that was sent in. This change was well-intentioned, but we realized we were focusing too much on the potential of the top 5% of Paladins, and while the solution was reasonable for that sub-group, it wasn't appropriate to apply across the board.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience,<br>
<br>

<br>
Their orignal idea was to make is so that we would take additional damage and still be able to slay like we always have, and potentially have our slays increase as our skills increased with PoP content.<br>
<br>
The resolution to this is has been that they have capped our slay damage where it is now, meaning that our slay damage will not increase as our abilities increase with PoP.<br>
<br>
What this means is that slay will begin to be less of a percentage in our overall damage.  <br>
<br>
Indeed, it is great to see high numbers.  I'm personally doing SU3 for eye candy, as it doesn't really contribute that much additional damage according to parses.  It's fun to see big numbers, and fun is what this game is about.<br>
<br>
When a damage shield parses out to do twice as much damage as slay, you can begin to see how much slay actually affects our dps.  (Kinda makes you want to quest at least to the 8th coldain ring eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
With this in mind, it has appeased us.  I've even read some posts from players thanking VI/SOE for not nerfing us, lmao.  Only time will tell how much this change truly affects our slay damage percentage-wise.  Spending 30aa to get a 15-20% increase in DPS is worth it for us now, but when we begin to level up again and slay begins do to proportionally less damage campared to our regular damage will we be in a situation to see how much this affects us.<br>
<br>
Catch ya in game ; )<br>

<br>
First time that one of us scored a quad crit and did 20k damage to a mob it likely would have been nerfed on top of the loss of tanking ability. Or perhaps there would have been a paladin loh squad with a group cheal cleric taking down named undead boss mobs(sorry, only one of you can attack per minute).<br>
<br>
Who knows......<br>
<br>
I suppose they will look into it after the rollout of PoP has quieted down a little. We'll see.....<br>
<br>
VI has shown themselves time and time again that nerfs are bad and the players do not like them.<br>
<br>
Their reply amused me the most though, the top 5% of paladins would have barely noticed being debuffed for 15% ac. It would have affected the low to mid paladins mostly, the ones that are struggling to gain some ground. The top 5% have over the soft cap after a 15% reduction. Do the math or use the calculator build in as an acessory to your operating system.<br>
<br>
BTW, if I were not so pissed when I read their initial release I would have likely have fallen off my chair laughing when I read<br>
&quot;There is nothing inherently wrong with that.&quot;(oh, it isn't broken, can we change that?).<br>
<br>
Might want to have someone go over their press releases. Maybe they should just change stuff and not tell anyone. Would probably be more effective and less inflammatory.<br>
<br>
