<br>
The decision has been made by the American government to go to war and look what you are trying to do. Play both sides of the fence. Jump back over with the Iraqi's and keep your fleas. We neither care nor want anything from you. You have been a big part of helping Saddam rebuild over the past 12 years. You are just as guilty as he is. <br>
<br>
As for the folks bashing the American government and people, think of this. Who in this world has maintained so much aid and help for every country in this world? How many American men and women have died over the years to help every country that asked us to? Yet you come to these boards and bash the U.S. OF A.. To each of you that feels that you are so very important in the scope of things take a hard look at what dictators do.<br>
<br>
They murder anyone who speaks against them. They jail anyone who thinks different then what they are told to think and do. They rape the women and children and laugh at them, then shoot them down. They care nothing about no one but themselves. Saddam has done this for years and its time he is brought to justice. <br>
<br>
Remember folks peace and freedom comes at a price. That price has been given by the men and women of America over and over again and will be so for years to come. As long as one person in this world is not given those basic freedoms we all adhere to, then America will always be there helping the oppressed.<br>
<br>
As stated the decision has been made to go and remove this madman from power and try to improve the way of life for the people of Iraq. Instead of bashing those who would stand up and help those who need help, support them and hope for a fast ending to such a harse duty.<br>

Of course he would say that.  France is a minor player as far as military or economic power.  The only power they really have left is being a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.<br>

Stop and think a moment before you answer that.<br>
<br>
Saddam claims Iraq had chemical and biological weapons.  He claims they don't have them anymore.  We (the US) tell him to prove it to the inspectors.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now let's take a moment aside here.  Let's say I accuse you of having 3 ounces of marijuana.  You tell me you used to, but you smoked it all last weekend.  I tell you to prove it.  Here is the hard hitter. . .how do you prove you DON'T have something?  I can prove to you I DO have something very easily - by pulling it out and showing you.  Proving to you I DON'T have something is fairly hard.  Even if you do a Body Cavity Search, maybe you're hiding it somewhere in the house, or your friend's house, etc etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Get the idea?  Proving you have something is easy, proving you don't is almost impossible, it's the main reason we have &quot;Innocent till proven guilty&quot; as a basic premise of our legal system.  Proving you DIDN'T do something is unbelieveably hard.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, we've got that premise down, and hopefully you're still with me.  To recap, Saddam said he used to have chemical and biological weapons and doesn't anymore, but is having trouble proving he doesn't have what he already said he doesn't have.  The French believe him, and agree we should do a strip search of Iraq - and to take a good long time doing it.  We say to hell with that, we're gonna check behind his left ear, cause we think we know where it is.<br>
<br>
Now, here is the herculean jump of logic - France believes Saddam when he says he has no weapons, *but* if he uses chemical and biological weapons (something he said he didn't have before) then the French will know he was lying and the US was right.<br>

For me whether the US or France helped him in the years before no longer matters. The man has proven to be a menace to his own people and would slaughter them for the hell of it. What people wants a leader like this? <br>

For France to ride the fence is a sorry excuse and for me they are playing both sides hoping to come out with something for themselves. NO SHADES OF GRAY.

 People miss the point alot about the inspectors the inspectors were not sent there to FIND the weapons, they were there to see proof of the destruction of the weaopns we KNEW he had which in 12 years there was NO PROOF he destroyed even a kitchen knife<br>
<br>
 The only reason France has opposed this attack is FRANCE BUYS OIL FROM IRAQ and has been selling them goods and technology PERIOD!!!<br>
<br>
 Russia has at least been honest and said we oppose this because Iraq owes us money and we want to do business with them <br>
<br>
 France jumped on a false moral high ground when their ONLY Intrest is becoming first a European, THEN Global Economic power.. I said many many posts ago the French would oppose the war but INSIST on being part of a UN force to rebuild Iraq<br>
well guess what.....<br>

Proving to you I DON'T have something is fairly hard. Even if you do a Body Cavity Search, maybe you're hiding it somewhere in the house, or your friend's house, etc etc.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Good analogy, but let me go further.  You say you don't have the marijuana and allow us to go in and check.  <br>
<br>
You then limit me as to where I can check. &quot;Sorry guys, can't go into my bedroom, I keep personal stuff in there.&quot;  <br>
<br>
In spite of this I keep on searching and find a hydroponics set up used to grow marijuana.  Your reply is &quot;well, there isn't any actual marijuana there so you can't be upset.&quot;  <br>
<br>
We ask to check the bathroom and you say &quot;sure, tomorrow, can't let you check today.&quot; <br>
<br>
Finally you get pissed off and throw me out completely.  Only when I threaten to call the cops do you actually let me back in.  <br>
<br>
I ask to speak to 10 of your friends who would know about your marijuana and you produce 2 saying you won't let me talk to the other 8.<br>
<br>
I find materials used to sell marijuana, which you explicitly agreed not to have, and you agree to destroy it, but say &quot;well, we weren't going to actually USE them, we justed wanted them around.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point I can either keep playing this game, or I can use common sense and realize that you are hiding something.<br>
<br>
If I keep playing this game then before I know it I'm gonna find my kids with marijuana.<br>
<br>
And if you really wanted to make this analogy fit it should have been heroin instead of Marijuana.<br>
<br>
By the way, every situation I came up with has a real life parallel with Iraq. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pallantides>Pallantides</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EotF</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/18/03 3:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What a load of BS!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> I have several problems with France's stance, but the biggest by far is the stance they have taken that they would not support military action under any circumstance.  <br>
<br>
Diplomacy is a complicated art, but in the final analysis there are two methods for sovereign nations to influence sovereign nations.  The first is economic sanctions and the second is through the use of force (or threat thereof).  Dictators are remarkably immune to economic sanctions in most circumstances and it doesn't hurt if you are sitting upon a supply of oil.  That leaves force as the only option.  It was force that curbed Saddam's ambitions previously and no matter how peace loving you want to say you are you can not overlook the fact that this option must remain open for diplomacy to have any hope of success.<br>
<br>
By denying force as an option flatly France undermined any chance of diplomatic efforts by the U.N. and in truth forced the U.S. down the path they are taking while at the same time giving Saddam the chance for hope that the U.S. would back down under international pressure.  France did not do this out of humane feelings or a peaceful nature, but simply as a diplomatic ploy to undermine the U.S.'s leadership role in the world and, in their hopes, further their own.  <br>
<br>
As Terq already pointed out they are already publicly backtracking and will continue to do so.  I have little respect for folks who choose &quot;peace at any cost,&quot; but if you seriously think this war is wrong you should consider following a banner other than France's.  Their motivations are hardly as pure as they try to make people believe.<br>

You got 3 friends called Frenchy, Russ and Germaine.  Russ and Germaine don't want Sam and his close friends to stop you from being their dealer but they also don't wanna piss Sam off too much.  So they continue to tell Sam to keep looking hoping that they can stretch it out forever.<br>
<br>
Frenchy however is the cocky one.  He's your biggest junky and don't really give a shit what Sam thinks.  He knows that you are good at hiding shit and also don't want Sam to find out that you got shitloads of his money.  See Frenchy knows that if Sam gets rid of you, he stands to lose a buttload of money.  It don't matter that Sam saved Frenchy's ass years ago, he still hates Sam with a passion.<br>
<br>
Frenchy, Russ and Germaine all know what you got, hell they helped you get it.  They don't really like you, but business is business.<br>
<br>
Well Sam ain't gonna listen to their bullshit nor yours.  He knows you got the bad stash.  You call Sam a bully that just wants your money.  Frenchy and friends try and help you but it don't work on Sam.<br>
<br>
Frenchy and friends try and convince you that after you kick his ass, they want to help take care of cleaning up your pad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ozzone>Ozzone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/18/03 3:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What a load of BS!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Frenchy and friends try and convince you that after you kick his ass, they want to help take care of cleaning up your pad.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

   However...you missed something in your analogy I'd like to make clear.  We aren't dealing with Marijuana, or Heroin.  We're dealing with fucking VX nerve gas.  <br>
<br>
   The U.N. Inspectors found 12, yes, 12 warheads that were MADE SPECIFICALLY to house chemical weapons.  Go read up on VX.  It has one of the highest inhaled death levels of anything concievable.  If Saddam, god forbid, dropped one of these things in NYC, it would be like 1,000,000 people going outside to a garage en masse and sucking on the exhaust pipe of a diesel truck.  <br>
<br>
   All you anti war protestors can go suck a dong.  Why do you think all the whiny bitch &quot;Human Shields&quot; came back?  Saddam said something along the lines of &quot;Well, you could stand in front of this nursing home, but why not stand here in front of this gigantic factory that makes Girl Scout Cookies&quot;.  You know why?  Because they know damn well he wasn't makin' no cookies, he makin bombs.  <br>
<br>
  It's hard to prove what you don't have when time and time again you tell the inspectors where they can and can't look, what they can and can't see, who they can and can't talk to. <br>
<br>
Uncle Sam is coming for YOUR ASS!<br>
