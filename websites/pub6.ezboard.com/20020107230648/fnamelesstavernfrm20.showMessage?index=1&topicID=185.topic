This is not some Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.&quot;<br>
<br>
We were also founded on slavery and women having no rights, as well as non-christians being ostracized and refused the right to vote, I suppose these should be re-legalized immediately... <br>
<br>
As I recall America does not &quot;belong&quot; to any specific group, it is every citizen's country. NOT just the christians, NOT just the men, NOT just the women, NOT just the whites, NOT just the blacks. It is too bad many groups , both majority and minority, seem to get the idea that their group is somehow better than the rest. Christians have no more right to control culture and laws(and some sort of 'special right and superiority') than do the black panthers or matriarchical feminists. <br>
<br>
I am an American citizen and I take offense at god being plastered in schools or any other form of public use. And I do not have plans to leave just because you feel your ways are somehow better than mine. I would be just as offended (and Im sure you would be) if schools started having &quot;Praise be to Allah/Gishnu/Satan&quot;, or &quot;FUCK RELIGION&quot; posters all over, the christian god is no exception.<br>
<br>
I do agree, however, that segregated &quot;multi-culture&quot; is a damaging thing, all cultures should not completely shut themselves out to the rest of America, they can and should slowly but surely integrate. Immigrants who blatantly REFUSE to change at all are damaging to the country.<br>

I saw a guy driving a car one day with a clergy sticker on it...not the everyday run of the mill one, but for the Satanic Church. Do you think I even thought to myself, &quot;well...I'm gonna call the local ACLU and demand he remove that from his car because it offends me&quot;? No, not only is it stupid, but most likely because it wasn't a Christian Clergyman they would have told me to FOFF. Everyone bitches about how Christians plaster their beliefs on things but not a soul says squat when someone from another religion is openly worshiping or has stuff out for everyone to see. I bet if some Muslim kid were praying in school you won't see him get suspended. Or the fact that everywhere you turn around the New Agers are putting something up. But its ok for them to do so right? Stop the double standards or shut up about what someone decides to do concerning THEIR religious choices. <p>Kuwen Fallenleaf <BR>

<br>
I get pissy if its in a PUBLIC SCHOOL. These are places run by the government, they should not have religious affiliation. If you don't like the taxi driver you mentioned you could have just left and gotten another cab, you cannot do this with schools (well, most people can't since they can't afford private school)... I am all against religion being in places in which you are FORCED to go by law.<br>
<br>
I really don't give a rats ass what people do in their own time, I don't care if people set up crosses here and there or anywhere, I don't care if people set up hindu god statues in their lawns or paint goathead pentagrams on their houses. But the moment one of these hits a public school you bet Ill be upset. <br>
<br>
My problem is not with PEOPLE showing religious belief, its a SCHOOL or GOVERNMENT that should not have any involvement. Thats not too much to ask in my opinion.<br>

I have the right to leave, but i also have the right to say stick it up your ass........are you opinionating that we should put a big cross on the US flag, like hippies put weed?<br>

You know it's funny that religion in school should be brought up.   What would happen if a pagan child were to come to school and perhaps perform pagan rites on school grounds?..........yeah thats right he'd be punted from school faster than a kid carrying a shotgun.  We already see this with ridicule of people wearing their favorite bands t-shirts to school, banning of anarchy symbols,  communist symbols, pentagrams from our school system.  Many young adults view an anarchy symbol as a sign of atheism, many in fact are anarchists and believe in the anarchist movement.  Yet that is considered a religion.  How come the school system has the right to ban these children?<br>

It sounds whomever wrote this, despite his authority as a citizen, could also use some understanding of his own.  The notion of recent immigrants having any less of a claim to what the USA offers is ridiculous however.

Does the essential experience of an individual's American family give its newer members an automatic &quot;claim&quot; to some deep understanding of freedoms that a new family does not?

One of the first issues faced by the founders of our country was the separation of church and state- something they found as an enlightened form of society.  Our nation was founded by god-fearing men, but we did not form a god-fearing nation.  There is no divine right of presidents... and while our money may say that we trust in god, that is as much a reference to our economic dependence on Adam Smith's &quot;invisible hand&quot; guiding our money rather than strict federal and state laws doing so.<br>
God is part of some of our culture... but so is Allah.<br>

Again, who is this &quot;our&quot;, this &quot;We&quot; that is continually referred to?

I finally found something to agree with.  Yes- every citizen has the right to express his or her own opinion.  Apparently the &quot;We&quot; has now shifted from the majority to the constitution.  I'm sorry- but white people may have made the constitution, but we are not it.  We are not the voice of it, we are not the arbitrary and final interpreters and enforcers of it.  Unfortunately our legislative branch is disproportionate in the number of WASPs in it, and while this is changing over time, it doesn't validate the &quot;we&quot;.<br>

If you or I were to move to say, China...you bet your ass we would a) have to learn their language and b) adapt to thier culture. The same can be said if we move to any given country. Supposedly when someone moves to the US its because they want to be here right? Well, you should expect that if you are going to be living in ANY country as a citizen or even as a guest you will see someone flying their national flag. If said flag offends you thats YOUR problem not the person who is flying it. Why should the general population have to walk on eggshells when we have the &quot;rights&quot; to fly our flags, pray (worship) to whoever we want, or any other thing we decide to do to display any of the above? PC was retarded to begin with and it is still retarded mainly because it was some backwater inbred lowlife from Arkansas that made it up. I don't care if you are white, black, red, brown, or green if you are a citizen of this country you should have the same rights as anyone else and be called AMERICANS...its the variety of different faces I see when I am out and about that make this a great country, but to get offended because someone is doing something like praying or flying their flag in public is just plain wrong. You can be offended all you want. Just be offended away from me and don't give me any shit about my flags or my religion or lack thereof <p>Kuwen Fallenleaf <BR>

I'm hardly looking for esoterics in a &quot;You have the right to be like us or leave our country&quot; statement.<br>
<br>
If we suppose that he is saying we should be &quot;one people rather than African-American, Anglo-American, etc.&quot;... I still do not see how this is different from a cry for conformity to a preset standard.  This post wasn't a call for peoples of every type to come together and form an ideal &quot;American.&quot;  It was pro-Christian, pro-founding fathers, and pro-English.  While there is nothing wrong being for any of these things... stating &quot;This is what an American is.  Be it or leave.&quot; is totally Un-American  (ooh, now that's a flame in this neopatriotic time)<br>
<br>
Even if he is calling for a unification of people as Americans, which I *don't* buy one bit, what makes the removal of culture, or even name (such as African-American) proper?  The culture of the Black man should be, and is more and more, a facet of American culture.  The culture of the Asian American is too.  The culture of the Christian White man has always been, and probably will for quite some time.  Being a part of American culture is being a part of this multifaceted society of unity in difference.  Taking away the &quot;African&quot;, &quot;Caribbean&quot;, &quot;Asian&quot;, &quot;Russian&quot;, &quot;Sweedish&quot; etc in front of the &quot;American&quot; will not change this.<br>
<br>
As for praying in public or refusing to, I agree there's no reason to be bent out of shape over it.  Just as there's no reason to be if someone raises, or- lets play devil's advocate, burns a flag.  It is the right of the citizen to do so.  Perhaps not in China, but in America.  It is the right of the citizen to conform, and it is his or her right to not.  Saying otherwise is attacking that right.<br>

You're forgetting something when you say this Kuwen, if you go to China the reason you better learn the language is b/c they don't have the same diversity as we do in America. Furthermore in European countries it's common to speak 2 or more languages rather than only one like we do here. They learn multiple languages mainly b/c their countries are so close and so much smaller.However, I find it strange that we are a meltingpot of cultures and languages, yet there is this huge fight to speak only english. <br>
<br>
Adapting to the new and unusual is what life is all about. Sure they *should* have a grasp of the common language here in America(if only to make communication easier), but instead of asking others to change so you can be more comfortable why not work on expanding yourself a little? I'm very proud to be an American, and just b/c i'm also proud to be irish, or scottish doesn't make me less of an American, I honestly think that is a big part of what America is all about being proud of where you came from, and where you are today. <br>
<br>
As far as religion is schools is concerned, I can honestly say that Christians sould be the last to complain about being restricted from worship. My younger brother is Wiccan, and he never shoves his beliefs into the faces of others, they are his own personal ideals. He and his friends formed a small group of wiccans and started a club which met at lunchtime to talk about wicca and other things. The club was shut down by the principal after 3 weeks, so the kids had to move their meetings off campus. Meanwhile the Christian club on campus remains, and even is allowed to have morning prayer around the flag pole. <br>
<br>
I myself am Christian, don't get me wrong it's a great religion. This isn't about Christianity being bad, it's about the unfair treatment of those who don't follow traditional religious beliefs by the state and by other people. I don't mind if there is a sign saying &quot;God Bless America&quot; posted out front of a school, but others might, and the constitution states that church should be separate from state. I imagine that there are many people who would be very upset if a sign saying &quot;Allah Bless America&quot; was posted in front of a school. I'm not offended if they take it down, it doesn't effect my beliefs. It's about respecting other people, a concept which is severely lacking in all society today. <br>
<br>
The point of being PC is not to hold anyone back, it's to respect those who are different, which is important in a country with such great diversity. <br>
<br>

How would you be able to say what was acceptable and what was not without infringing on someones equal rights? Someone would always be discriminated against because they wouldnt be allowed to do certain things.<br>
<br>
And lastly, can't people just LAY OFF this religion stuff in school? I mean, are students running home extra fast so they can get their supressed prayers done? As far as I can see, this is a PURELY ADULT issue, I have yet to see any students (except for muslims since their slave codes, er koran tells them they have to pray 5 times a day at certain times) who are running around shouting &quot;I NEED TO PRAY!!!!! LET ME PRAAAAAAY&quot;. I really dont see the problem with people just praying when they get home.<br>
<br>
And besides that, if a student absolutely HAS to prey in school, why do they need a designated time to do it? They can just get to class 5 minutes early and do it, lol. <p><center>Yam's Word is Final!

<br>
Now the religion in school thing...I can remember a time where it was ok to pray in school (yes I am old enough &gt;&lt;). Now a days you can't or you get disciplined by being suspended or whatever. Now, I do think if someone so chooses to pray in class or whatever they can and should keep the prayer to themselves, but also if someone chooses to not to thats their choice. I know that there is now a &quot;quiet time&quot; where students can pray or reflect on things in school. If you are religious then you may choose this time to pray, but if you are not then at least be respectful enough not to disturb others who may be. If I read it right no one forces anyone to pray to any particular god during this time but it gives students a moment to either do this or just gather themselves for the school day ahead. Bottom line is...you respect my rights I will respect yours...what alot of people don't realize is this. When you go and have so and so suspended or whatever because they choose to pray or carry a bible, koran, etc...you have taken away THEIR rights. People get so caught up about how if someone is doing these things they are taking away their right not to deal with them; that they don't see that they are takig those peoples rights too... <p>Kuwen Fallenleaf <BR>
