That was just ugly.  Not in terms of raid, but for all our risk we got almost no reward.  Things were a bit different on this one...<br>
<br>
First off we had a slightly late start.  I apologize for that.  Due to technical difficulties on Friday night (Harry Potter and snow) I was late in trying to log on.  I then discovered I wasnt able to log on.  This posed the technical problem of not being able to get Hate Stones.  When I was finally able to log in on Saturday it was almost noon PST.  I then remembered  that we cant drop cash on the ground anymore and had to enlist the aid of another druid to help me get the cash to my enchanter mule I keep in Neriak for this purpose.<br>
<br>
However, technical difficulties resolved, Hate Stones were purchased and sign-in's began by about 12:15pm PST.  Now this is where it gets ugly.  I had intended to only take up about 48-54 people.  We ended up with something around 65.  This is way more than should be up there.  Indeed I believe it led to some of our difficulties later on.  Not only that, but it streched out the time it took me to make groups.  Hate is weird since you need to make up almost 2 group lists.  Final groups and port groups since we only have so many wizards groups need to be made with 5 people with the 6th person coming up in a group at the end.  This was further complicated by my decision to risk a portal break as this meant groups had to be combat ready with just 5 people.<br>
<br>
Wait.  Portal break?  Anyone who has been on KCoG PoH raids before probably cringe at those two words.  In the almost 2 years we've been doing this, KCoG has never managed a successful portal break break before.  The last time I tried it, we managed our only technical PoH failure.  Technical because we did break the portal, but in doing so end breaking ourselves as well.<br>
<br>
However, we had the talent.  Zellex, the Planes puller from Hell put on a surprise entrance in style. :P .  I also had many experienced people from The Watchmen to help out.  Along with Incubis from Valoran who was our level 60 enchanter I figured we had a decent chance this time.  Also I had spent so much time making groups that if we did the normal run to west camp and camp and log and alt and wait for CR...it would take at least another hour maybe more in case of a bad CR.  So we went with a Portal Break.<br>
<br>
And I'm happy to announce we actually managed to do it this time.  Everyone followed instructions and we moved rapidly from the portal to our first camp by the East wall.  We did have a pair of port snafu's by our port wizards.  Fortunatly I had anticipated problems might occur and had additional Hate stones on me.  So we werent delayed very much.  I might have more to say here...if I havent done the same thing before.  So lets not go into that nor dwell on a problem that was quickly solved <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
It looked like an enchanter night.  Which was good considering how many enchanters we had.  Normally Enchanter drops are pretty slim on Hate raids so it was nice to see quite a few of them.  Unfortunatly none of the enchanter drops was the coveted hat nor robe.  But still respectable in number.  We also picked up a Staff of Elemental Mastery: Fire from the Mistress of Scorn here.  Congrats to Redorious.  It doesnt help him on his epic quest, but from the way he was jumping up and down screaming &quot;Oh, Oh, Oh!&quot; I'm guessing it must still be pretty good. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
From our first camp we moved on over to our second by one of the houses by the NE wall.  Somewhere along the line someone might have ended up going too far up the wall and pulled second floor aggro.  Within a few minutes of our setting up in the house we experienced our first wipeout of the night.  It wasnt very pretty, but everyone stayed calm.  We quickly camped out our remaining clerics and because people listened and the melee's stayed engaged most were able to camp out.  Subsequent explorations by Zellex showed that there were several mobs in places they generally arent so it is possible that the aggro wasnt second floor induced but rather just an unfortunate happening.  In any event, our amazing Healer Namzat bravely took a 49 rez in order to quickly get back up to Hate and rez everyone with with his epic.  Although he did end up losing almost 2 blue bubbles of xp on this, I never heard him complain out loud.  This is the type of discipline that it takes on these raids.  And why I dont want to hear anyone complaining about rez'es.  Our cleric often have to sacrafice their xp to get everyone else rez'd quickly.  Its not fair for them to give up 56 rezes if people will complain about not getting them later.<br>
<br>
In any event we quickly remobilized and rez'd ourselves and we were on our way.  Only to have to camp out again shortly after to clear some aggro.  Unfortuantly there were about 65 of us still in a small area and all were camping out, then quickly logging back in.  I believe this, more than anything else, contributed to the massive disconnects we experienced.  While the network itself was probably a little shaky, and Hate does have known disconnect problems, all of these were probably magnified by so many people trying to log in at the same time.  This is why we port up with a few seconds between each group.  To minimize this as much as possible.<br>
<br>
However, we were able to use a chat room to organize ourselves and people were eventually able to log back in.  Fortunatly Hate does not have a fast respawn time and the area we were in was already mostly clear.  Unfortunatly here we ran into the second of the night's problems when we couldnt find Mordachi's corpse.  As it turns out he was probably feared or ran while LD and his corpse ended up in a wall.  Now I'll have another post going into my expectations of dealing with GM's in the future.  But let me say, here and now, that I do not ever want to hear anyone degrading or talking badly about either the Customer Service in game nor the Guides or GM's themselves.  If you ever feel the need to do so, then feel free to take yourself right out of the raid.  I have neither the time nor energy to deal with people who are rude or abusive in language or act.  The GM's and Guides are not here to be your personal punching bags to get your fustrations out.  Nor do I want to hear anything about them indirectly by listening to people be rude about Verant.  We all know the problems in the game.  If you cant deal with it without being abusive then once again please feel free to raid somewhere else.  Preferably somewhere like DAoC or AC or UO.  I dont expect I'll have to mention this again in any other raid.  My stance on this is firm.  Push me on this and you will be kicked off the raid.  Fail to leave and I'll simply call the raid over.<br>
<br>
Okay.  Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I quickly put a petition through to get the corpse moved out of the wall even though in general the policy is not to move corpses in walls since thats part of what summon corpse is for apparently.  In the meantime I made some preparations for the worst case by making sure we could port Mordachi back up to Hate with a coffin so his corpse could be summoned.  While all this was happening we moved the camp again to the old West Camp site.  During this time I talked to 2 guides before getting it kicked up to the senior guide on duty.  We quickly talked about it and the corpse was transfered out of the wall.  I'm not sure on this since I wasnt looking but I believe it was close to the camp.  The whole thing took about 30 minutes from the time I put the petition through to when Mordachi was rez'd.  Once again EQ Customer Service quickly came to the rescue.  I dont know what other folks experiences have been, and I dont care.  This is the third or fourth time things have quickly and efficently and amiably resolved on a KCoG raid since I started running them.  As far as I'm concerned they're doing their job great.<br>
<br>
Now that everyone was back together, we quickly began to pull mobs and clear the area.  For whatever odd quirk of Fate almost all the mini's were up.  And I mean all of them.  There must have been almost a dozen that we went through.  We moved the camp slightly south to the SW corner for a few minutes to dispatch several mini's and a few other mobs close by.  This happened quickly and easily.  And so I guess I got a bit overconfident.<br>
<br>
After taking out the corner mobs we moved back to the West Camp spot and proceeded to pull the Maestro area.  It was already about 6pm PST and I was anxious to get moving so we could take some of the second floor.  Now to a large degree what happened was my fault.  Its part of what I'm here for, to see when these things happen and stop if before it becomes a problem.  Unfortunatly I was lulled by how well things were going and wasnt paying total attention.  During one pull a mob ran north a ways and the entire raid ran north to kill it.  Unfortunatly this also happens to be Zellex's pull path that he uses to split the mobs.  The resulting aggro once again resulted a fair number of casualties.  Fortunatly while I did not see it in time to stop it, once I saw people moving north I immeditly had the clerics begin to camp.  As a result most of the deaths were actually melee's.<br>
<br>
Okay, I have been a bit harsh.  Mistakes were made by both myself and the raid here.  However, once again there was no panic by people.  Everyone quickly saw what had happened and I'm again proud to say people listened to instructions.  The melee's did a great job in splitting off and holding aggro on different mobs to allow everyone else to camp out.  Their sacrafice in staying to allow others to camp out really shortened the CR time and prevented a total wipeout.  As it was only about half the raid died here.  So yes, mistakes were made.  But mistakes are always made with this many people and so many inexperienced people.  But it is the discipline that everyone has that prevents these mistakes from becoming a disaster.  Everyone did great on that.<br>
<br>
And so once again while Zellex was getting some popcorn we finished rezing everyone who died and rebuffed them.  Unfortunatly we still had some problems with people running north.  As a result I was forced to really put my foot down.  Believe me folks, when I say I will call a raid due to a few people not listening, I mean it.  Since TL's require a confirmation box I find it best jsut to call the raid.  If people want to stay up in Hate alone, thats their lookout.  But I'm not going to endanger everyone because a few people cant or wont listen.  When I or those I designate as leadership say something I expect it to be listened and followed.  No one needs to know why at the time.  I will generally explain things here on the recap but during the raid I often dont have time to explain things like pull paths or debate if it should be done here or there.  If the puller says he wants it done in a certain spot, then thats where its done.  I trust my management team and if anyone who cant trust me to put my trust in the right spots, then I dont need nor want you on these raids.  People in general do not need to understand why something is being done, only to do what is said.<br>
<br>
That being said I will try to explain things as best as possible.  However, often things get tense with multiple conversations going between me and the leadership team that the raid in general doesnt see.  I'm in constant communication with my puller, main assist, and enchanter.  Along with several other key people.  When it hits the fan I usually dont have time to do more than shout out a few instructions and hope that people listen without question.  Questions and answers can come later.  When it hits the fan, its actions that will always save the day.<br>
<br>
Bleh.  I got back on my soapbox.  I'm sorry about that.  But people not listening is one of my pet peeves.  Not because they're not listening to me.  Self gratification or adoration is not in my personality makeup.  I dont care if people like or listen to me.  However, when leading a raid like this people not listening to me or my leadership team can get everyone killed.  That bothers me.  We need to work as a team here.  <br>
<br>
Okay now that all that is out of the way again, the killings and spankings continued.  We quickly recovered and quickly finished pulling the way through to the Maestro's house.  We then rushed it to kill another mini being the Ashbornedrake Broodmaster.  He's a fairly hard kill depending on where you do it.  But even with a pair of adds everyone quickly moved to the right place and killed him.  Heck, no one even got lost gettng there.  Thats got to be a first as well.<br>
<br>
We then setup for the Hand of the Maestro and the Maestro himself.  These two mobs were quickly dispatched back to the spawning room where they waited for their next futile attempt to defeat us.  From here we reorganized a bit and began pulling the Second Floor of Hate.  Now it was getting late, it was already about 9pm PST.  Personally I was getting very hungry and tired, but we still had about 45 people and everyone wanted to keep going.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly the second floor proved to be a major disappointment.  Now the second floor of Hate has some very very nice drops.  Possibly the best drops in the game unless you plan on seeing Veeshan's Peek, the Plane of Mischief, or the Sleepers Tomb.  Unfortuantly these drops are also very rare.  As we saw last night.  While in general we will get at least 1 nice drop, this last raid we ended up totally empty of the high level stuff.  But its all hit or miss.  Sometimes you get the good stuff, other times you get nothing.  Perhaps the next time we'll get twice as much as normal.<br>
<br>
Now personally I consider the second floor to be a total waste of time since the drop rate is so low.  To me a few awesome drops does not make up for keeping the raid together for an additional 5 hours.  We also begin to run short on reagents.  However, what I do consider to be worthwhile is the fact that we get to SEE the second floor.  Most people dont see very much of it really.  Because many guilds and alliances simply cant do it very well and even the larger guilds feel the same way as I do and simply dont bother with it.  Some from a purely tourist point of view I do think its worth it.  But please dont get your hopes up on drops.  In our last 3 forays up there I have yet to see more Cullers.  However you never know and the next one might net us some.  Its a nice place for additional chances at loot, but should not be counted as the main reason for being there.<br>
<br>
On the bright side, we put paid on the Corrupter of Life's account.  Which netted us a ncie piece for the High Elf paladin's alternate to the Firey Defender.  Qblade seemed to be quite happy about it.  And so by about 12am PST we were hitting the end of the raid.  Not really that we couldnt go on longer, but one of the KGC rules is that we need to clear out by 1am PST in order to make room for the next guild.  Courtesy is very good.  We make room for them, next time they make room for us.  Its all good.  Plus we were out of peridots.<br>
<br>
So we lotto'd off the gems.  Lots.  As usual.  And called it a night.  While the second floor was a bust, we cleaned up quite a bit of stuff from the first floor.  We also played slap happy with a whole lot of mini's.  More in fact that I've seen up in a long time.  Some mistakes were made.  Many valiant stands were also made.  There were a few bad calls, and some very nice splits.  Overall everyone followed orders and did very well in splitting out the kills with main and secondary assists.  Even on the second floor discipline held and adds were quickly split out and held by the secondary while the primary assist and their groups took out the first kill before moving to the adds.  At one point on the second floor we had 3 Disciples on us almost at once.  Yet we held easily and without any deaths I think.<br>
<br>
Overall everyone did a great job.  And once again I and The Watchmen were proud to have been there. When you consider how diverse KCoG is, that we can do this and do it well is very impressive.  So thank you to everyone that came.  Especially Rmog and Scalapula our Main and Secondary assists throughout most of the night.  To Namzat our rezing cleric who kept us on our feet throughout the entire night.  And Incubis our enchanter who came along simply to roll on the Essense knowing that he had a very slim chance at getting it, but figured it was better than nothing.  And of course Zellex for pulling and somehow not training us throughout the night.  These raids happen and happen well because of the quality of people involved.  Once again, I was proud to have been a part of it.<br>

Only problem I had was folks kept dispelling my Mala/Malosini debuffs. Only Spite Golems need debuffed, occassionally revenants as they may have a damage shield or others as raid leader calls out. I don't debuff for my benefit,  I'm lvl 60, I can nuke 'em bald, I do it so all *you* can light up the mobs hehe! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Fire mastery staff is Focus item for lvl 49+fire pets, now while many malign them, which is why lot of mages ignore the Fire Staff, I use them a lot. On Kael caster giants and on the sirens in sirens grotto they *rule* they are the best caster disrupters in whole game vernear.  So I'm VERY glad to have walked away with one, cheers KGoC!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
One day I wil get that Earth staff, somehow...*sneaks a set of loaded dice on raids* :&gt;<br>
In all my time playing have only seen 7 Magi P'Tasi's, and only one had staff, and I lost roll...which gives you some idea of frustrations involved, which is why I greatlly appreciate KCoG letting me come along, and why I'm so happy to help you all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
