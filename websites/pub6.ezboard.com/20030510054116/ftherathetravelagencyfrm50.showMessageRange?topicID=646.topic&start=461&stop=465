Response to Teamwork thread in the guild rep forum.</span><hr size=1> You guys have made some excellent points about the authority of the RTA, about these mobs being at least somewhat different than other mobs, and about the relatively small effect teaming on these mobs might have on high end guilds.  That is why pages and pages ago people like Emil agreed to work things out, a compromise.  <br>
<br>
In Rogg's post he used as an example the guilds who can currently do KT alone as the guilds capable of teaming AD.  The problem higher end guilds have is the two teaming guilds getting two shots on lower end content.  NB still does KT (and did last night if I am not mistaken), intending to use the loot from KT, at least KT's head and the ST key.  When a mob gets killed it is killed for one reason-progression.  Regardless of how much progression, or how hard it is to obtain, it is all still progressing through the game.  Each kill of KT gives a caster two more FT, and another melee a chance to get primal weapons, which is a huge step for most guilds, and for individual progression.  <br>
<br>
Progression from KT level mobs is not as much a concern for NB as it might for say, LoM. (just one example)  LoM has not killed Emperor yet, and is not in VT.  They also have not killed enough PoP mobs to consider their progression fully worthwhile.  They still NEED rotation mobs in order to progress, rotations that people intending to team on AD are also on.  So while LoM struggles to take out PoP content on their own, someone else can team and kill him, and not face any negative effects, whatsoever?  If you say that LoM should team up to progress further; as was said at the beginning of this argument &quot;who are you to tell us how to progress?&quot;.  <br>
<br>
The current system that has been in place for a very long time in order to prevent guilds from &quot;double dipping&quot; getting twice as many loots per group of people, requires all rotations to be merged for alliances.  By asking for alliances to be seperated for rotation mobs you are essentially asking to evade this penalty for teaming.  <br>
<br>
That being said these mobs are not on rotation, and most seem to agree they should not be, due to lack of interest.  (though if you ask me at least several guilds should at least be somewhat interested in doing the mobs for loot...)  Because they are not on rotation, they do need to be considered at least somewhat differently than regular rotation mobs.  They cannot and will not be considered completely seperately, because in the end they are progression, same as anything else.  <br>
<br>
To that end, it has been suggested that if two or more guilds want to team up for kills they can on non rotational pop mobs.  The penalty (for there has to be in order to be fair to the guilds who chose not to team up, both high end and lower end) could very easily be a merging of rotations for whatever amount of time, say 1 month per pop boss mob kill.  Or better yet two weeks.  Two guilds need to get 90 people flagged, they do AD twice, and spend the next month killing mobs together and splitting loot.  You might think that this is a harsh penalty.  But if you look at a guild like SoY, who has 20 hard core players+&lt;insert random number here&gt; versus a guild like Bots, who has 60 (I didn't check, just making a number up) hard core players.  It will take SoY+alliance guild the same amount of time to gear up their people doing the mobs together, as it would Bots.  Larger guilds are just that, larger guilds.  If you can kill Vindi with 12 people on a regular basis, it will take you no time at all to get all 12 people with full Vindi gear, whatever pieces you wanted.  A guild with 40 people already pays a penalty killing the same mob, because it will take them more than 3 times as many killings to do the same thing.  I understand NB has over 120 people on their full roster, though I don't think more than 60 are online the same night very often.  They pay their penalty for having more people, if they want to get everyone geared up.  <br>
<br>
Teaming without penalty would simple be progressing at 2x the speed of a full guild with similar gear capable to similar things.  If SoY decides not to team up on PoP mobs, they still get their rotation mobs, and progress at a fair rate.  If two other guilds on KT rotation who cannot solo kill AD do kill him, they get progression that SoY does not get, and they get the same exact progression otherwise that SoY can get.  <br>
<br>
I hope that we can work this out, because clearly both sides see different parts of this as unfair.  Please consider not only your own side and counterarguments, but also consider the people who don't decide to go with your arguments.  <br>
<br>
I know I am against teaming, but I think I see the other side of the argument.  I believe teaming should be allowed, but teaming without penalty should not be allowed.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Spin Doctor <br>

<br>
The americal judicial system works on technicalities.  If you do something that many people consider against the law for whatever reason, if there isn't a specific law agaisnt what you did, and you have a good enough lawyer you get set free.<br>
<br>
Sure, someone down the line can MAKE a law outlawing what you did.<br>
<br>
Right now, the technicality that AD is not a &quot;on the page&quot; rotation mob exists.  I personally don't *care* if Gromm or Karadin feels the same heartwarming way toward AD that they do toward KT.  There is no RULE set in stone that says multiple entities may not team up on mobs that are not liste don the rotations page.<br>
<br>
If that means that you want to either A. Make that rule or B. Put the mobs in question on the official rotation page, then DO IT.  <br>
<br>
Let's stop pussy-footing around, and get rid of technicalities so that they can't be used in this arguement any more.  <br>
<br>
I understand, and almost even support, the anti-teaming arguement now, but that doesn't change the fact that technically nobody who has teamed, or will team today, hasn't done anything wrong according to the book of the law. <p><P>

<br>
We don't want the situation to get ugly either by doing what other servers do.  <br>
<br>
Personally I believe it would slip to a &quot;form&quot; of cockblocking however if teaming went into a common practice.  By &quot;form&quot; I mean, I bet the only ones who would ever see the mob up would be those who were setup, in the zone, watched over and ready to kill them as a single entity.<br>
<br>
A lot of work in a situation like that but it would probably be the best case resolution if teaming became a issue on the server.  <br>
<br>
The worst case.....fug let's not think about it.     <br>
<br>
It's a no win situation BoTS, TL, NB are in at the moment, a damn if we do and damn if we don't.  <br>
<br>
People like you and Rog now understand what we've been saying.... others don't so we just keep bashing our heads against the wall, repeating the same examples, same precidents, same this same that over and over again, until eventually people &quot;get it&quot;.<br>

Jeshter thanks for the explanation of the points here.<br>
<br>
If this whole discussion has nothing to do with changing rules on rotation mobs in general, and your point concernign teaming is only concerning PoP mobs....then why even bother with the discussion.<br>
<br>
That decision is being made in the message board below on Elemental planes..and if they want your opinion...oh wait..they do not want your opinion.  Since if I understand correctly teh guilds involved in that discussion do not need to team...then those who do need an alliance of some sort are not represented in that discussion.<br>
