<br>
Basically if you can have trust in someone that you don't know, You're asking to get scammed, It's kinda like how real life would be.  Would you ask someone you didn't know to hold some money for you? Or to take care of your house while you were away? Heh I'm sure you will answer that correctly. <p>     <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=150739">Miroh Tsu'Tsuruden, The Feigned</a>

My return is quite a shock isnt it? Yes, I know:<br>
<br>
&quot;OH NO! GONANIN HAS LEFT TO MAKE HIS OWN GUILD! KINO ARE YOU SURE HE CAN HANDLE IT!&quot;<br>
<br>
And as usual, Kinomar already saying &quot;I've trained him to his fullest potential, he will do fine.&quot;. <br>
<br>
Well, I did do fine. Anyways I want to get something out....<br>
<br>
www.geocities.com/EQNovel/4.wav<br>
<br>
That file is the one thing thats been on my mind. The questions at the end. Hope your pleased :P &quot;<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
the above is the post of a NUT JOB WACK O<br>
he was banned for harrment not only from 7 guilds but from the entire fricken game!<br>
AND the quotes he gave of what i said NEVER HAPPEND!-<br>
&quot;And as usual, Kinomar already saying &quot;I've trained him to his fullest potential, he will do fine.&quot;. &quot; -yeah that line u just read seconds ago never happend i booted his ass becuase he was pissing EVERYONE OFF.<br>
<br>
www.geocities.com/EQNovel/4.wav &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;the addy he left is a whacked out stocker thing going on and he even put the damn addy wrong it was www.geocites.com/eqnovel for his gay ass site that listed all his banned ass characters and www.geocities.com/eqnovel/4 for the song he dubed his talking voice over a real song is a very lame ass attempt to get noticed. if u go to these sites beware they are scary @#%$ and could cuase mental injury. If you see him or any of his alternates making it into guild BANN HIM remove him get his ass out of my guild ! <br>
I banned him for harrassing members and he bugged enough people to get him back in and now hes sneaking about in our ranks doing god only knows what to our rep.<br>
He is NOT welcome he is a crazy @#%$ up head job posted tons of wack @#%$ at the nameless tavern about sending mail bombs and blowing @#%$ up there was way to much to add to this but if u go to nameless tavern ull find all this @#%$ im talking about with the mail bombs and stuff.<br>
I REPEAT DO NOT INVITE HIS NUTJOB /guildremove&lt;hisnewestlameassname&gt;<br>
Also note he will appear to be a annoying as hell person on anycharcter he has he tends to try to hook up with the female graphic characters &quot;yeah he a loser flirting with a cartoon image..&quot;<br>
if u have questions ask u have my email. if anyone see's him even and u dont have the commands to boot him tell he asap so i can boot him.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
ALL the above was posted at my guilds web site . the sick song he did about solara . he is pissed i kicked his ass out of my guild for being a STOCKER.<br>
also id like to add some things to toatlly rip his bull shit story apart. <br>
1. im a 53 SHAMAN i would never pay 5k for TOTEMIC.<br>
2. if i stole a 75hp earring id like to know what the name of it is?<br>
3. i put &quot;please stop sending me tells i have reported you for harrassment &quot; as a afk banner becuase his wackO keeps making new characters  and sending me tells ( i have had to delete old ignore and add in his news TWICE!!!!!!!!<br>
4. just adding that the song was sill at address on 6-12-2, solara has totally stopped playing becuase this FREAK.<br>
5. I HAVE NEVER EVER EVER been banned for anything unlike GONANIN who as been banned 4times once for using EQW and rest of times for geuss what....HARASSMENT.<br>
6. NOW he freakign harrasses my 13 year old sister in law on her account becuase this FREAK is such a stocker.<br>
7. im sure the VI guys can do a check to see if i ever sold a frost blade in my entire playing time , hell i dont even think ive seen one on a player, yet alone ever sold anything to vengance blade becuase he IS GONANIN and vengance and THE WARRIOR are same GUY!!!!!!!!!!<br>
8. WHY are you letting all these people use your account for? did you ever think to ASK THEM what the hell they did with your shit? maybe check one of there characters?<br>
9. ok just a few more to really blow this fucking liers story to shit.... HOw do you steal forest loops from people? if they leave a f-loop laying on corpse for 2 minutes they are dumb. but being a 53 shaman i think i can handle a giant in fm......<br>
10.Gnoll Chain!!! where do you get this SHIT!!! my pet can wipe the entire ZONE of BB why on earth would i BEG for a lore peice of crap, that is for RANGER armor!!!!!!<br>
all in all i REALLY think Gon/thewar/vengance.. what ever he wants to call himself for the hr. needs to get a life ,a clue and a job to he can pay for a face job so his parents will let him out of his bedroom and he can try to get a real girl friend and not a GUY PLAYING A FEMALE CHARACTER(solara)on a GAME... fucking sick basterd.<br>
and <br>
www.geocities.com/EQNovel/4.wav &lt;&lt;&lt;site he made  phsyco song at...<br>
ps. if i find u in real life im goning to shit kick you for crap you  said to my sister sick little fuck.<br>

&quot;&quot;Um, anyone else notice that this post looks to be something by &quot;Vengeanceblade&quot; to make himself look good?&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Let me be the first to comment: Why would I make myself look good? I just do whats right, letting people know about scammers and whos doin' what and how their using their methods.<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;75hp droppable earrings, and the so called &quot;log&quot; is well, fucked up.&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
I said it wasnt a log. I said it was pretty close as to what happened minus half the profane language he said at the beginning and the racial slurs. You know what the N word is? Well it upsets me alot and typing it almost makes me mad.<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;And then some spiel about the &quot;newbie&quot; wanting to remain anon, and then saying the newbie was banned? &quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
I dont like talking about him. But Sephz was in Kinomars guild because he pitied the sh*thead. After gaining full trust he tried everytime to please Kinomar, and when he let Kinomar on, he screwed over a good reputation, and didnt even tell Sephz about it. He gets banned for insecuring his account before he can change his password back and then returns this summer to be scammed by Kinomar AGAIN, even I was scammed.<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;so no way to validate his story. Wanna bet that he made this whole thing up?&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
Are you some kind of Kinomar Supporter? Well you will be happy to know I'll ignore you at all costs if you are. Kinomar is bad news, and if you knew him AT ALL you'd probably believe what I said because his nefarious acts tend to do occur alot. Mostly around the PermaFrost area. I think he even stole an IceGiant camp lastnight, but died and the other group of people came back to claim the camp before his group returned.<br>

Poor people get thieved-</span><hr size=1> I do have a life ;P I have a girlfriend, a sister in the military, and loving friends. I just come here ofr about 5 mins and then I MIGHT play EQ 1 hour during the day but I mostly play at night. This is a limited hobbie, I'm not allowed to play for long periods of time. If I find myself playing for over 15 hours I can easily begin to see 10,000 colors all over the place. You know when you blink you might see some little dots, well if I play such a great colorful game for so long- pop. My eyes water and I see tons of colors. I dont go crazy and have seizures like most people with such a Photosensory disability, but, my eyes do burn and it increases my chances of being blind. So thats why I dont really play that much. <br>
<br>
My parents also believe its crucial that I have a social-life so I'm permitted 6-8 hours a day only. Thats less then 1/3 a day. Kinomar tends to play constantly according some my EQ Addicted neighboor. ;P<br>

Poor people get thieved-</span><hr size=1>  Yeah Vengeanceblade, If I play for around 12-13 hours straight (On the weekends before I put a stop to the playing EQ thing) I would like hear shit.  Not like freakin out ya know but see where I live you can't go 2 hours without hearing a cop,ambulence or Firetruck in the background.  So for some reason wants the lack of serious needed sleep kicks in I'll hear that shit but it doesn't stop until I log off and go to bed.  But cong you for actually being one of the few who can play EQ as if it were a Game Console game, ya know very easy to not be hooked.<br>
<br>
P.S. Sorry for getting Off Topic<br>

 I dont know anything about this guy scamming and crap, but i can agree with dagrittykitty's bit about kinomar being an awful shaman.<br>
<br>
 Grouped with him in DP as my beast...was me 2 other beasts a bard and Kinomar. All 3 of us beasts were doing the healing....Kin was pulling singles as we were dealing with 2 or 3 others. Not once did he lay a slow or heal down. <br>
 He would also go afk for extended points and after about 2 mins i would kick him each time...low and behold as soon as he was kicked i get a tell &quot;back&quot;.<br>
<br>
 After about 3 times of this crap i kicked him for good and the /shouts /ooc kicked in. Then the trains...<br>
<br>
 After each and every train i would thank him for pulling for us as the exp was fairly good...this served to anger him more ).<br>
<br>
 Eventually he got cocky and pulled 5 or 6 hoppers from cave along with some shrooms...we saw it comming and set our warders and the fat ogre beast to block the zone to ME. Much joy came out of watching him die in 2 seconds.<br>
<br>
 Anyway thats a little story about this fella...in my opinion one of the worst players in the game.<br>
