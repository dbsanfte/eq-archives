Lets try and keep things consice and organized in terms of percieved problems to the current system and their possible solutions. Remember, we're trying to make this acceptable and benefitial to the majority of the Rathe community, there will be the whiners and the trolls and those who simply do not agree with what is stated, but that's life. I'm going to state what I feel sums up the current problems percieved on most sides of the issue and what *I* feel the best solution is. Please, if something has been stated do not reiterate, simply agree of disagree and post why, people get tired of reading the same posts over and over for umpteen pages.<br>
<br>
1. The calendar, in it's current state is abused in terms of piggybacking.<br>
2. The current system is equal, though not necessarily fair and guilds with 75+ toons to pull from share the same amount of time as those with 18.<br>
3. Larger guilds feel that gods sit up too long and the turnaround for planes is very inneficient.<br>
4. Larger guilds feel that epic quest mobs should be dealt with only by those entities that are capabable of completing the quests in the near future.<br>
5. Smaller guilds feel as though they are being strongarmed into conceding rights to larger guilds who have no business trying to dictate their actions.<br>
<br>
<br>
This seems as though it fits the majority of the complaints voiced on both sides of the spectrum. If I've missed any please feel free to fill in the blanks. <br>
<br>
I feel the first two complaints can be addressed with curbing the amount of days reservable by a posting entity in accordance with the number of planable toons they have. This would require an active roster to be posted on a designated page at all times.<br>
example:<br>
18 to 30 toons- 1 day hate 1 day fear, 2 days sky<br>
31 to 48 toons- 3 days for fear and hate combined (not 3 fear and 3 hate), 2 days sky<br>
48 to 66 toons- 2 days hate 2 days fear, 3 days sky<br>
66+ toons- 5 days both hate and fear(once again, NOT 5 fear and 5 hate), 3 days sky<br>
<br>
note- Fridays in sky reservable if Isle 5 has been previously reached AND cleared by the reserving entity, in the interests of increasing sky efficiency and epic quest completion.<br>
<br>
This may not be perfect and it WILL cause the calendar to get backed up, but 2 new planes are arriving soon as well as a server split (hehe that'll take away about 1/10th of the planeable population) and the days could be kept the same with the addition of new planes, which would halve calendar bottleneck. It doesnt necessarily need to be that complicated, it could be 2 days for guilds below 50 and 4 for guilds above 50, any number of combinations would server the purpose. That purpose being to ENCOURAGE alliances and make the use of piggybacking far less productive than it is in the calendars current state, it would also help increase the rate at which epic quests were completed while not excluding any individual from attempting, and possibly completing, whatever quest he or she chooses.<br>
A seperate posting page, to be given access to one individual from each posting enitity could be created to list members of said posting entity who are ONE OR TWO items away from completing epic quest, along with the items they need to complete that quest. Once again, the majority of these individuals are likely in larger, older guilds, so it stands to reason it would aid in the efficiency in which quests were completed(isn't this what KEG/CIW/BotS were looking for?).At the same time this system would benefit the ENTIRE community and allow members of ANY guild aid in completing their quests and would promote cooperation and respect amongst the server community.<br>
I would also like to suggest a meeting between representatives from multiple guilds, which represent different interests (see complaint #5). It's understandable that the larger, older guilds are frustrated, but the majority of the problems stated by the smaller guilds in reaction to a meeting between only 3 entities are understandable as well.<br>
<br>
Once again, these are my views on how the problems percieved by the majority of the Rathe community can be circumvented or outright done away with. Feel free to refute any of the points I mentioned or to add to my statements, if you're going to mindlessly flame then I'll just be forced to make you look silly (if you havent done so yourself). Please, add some constructive criticism and productive ideas to put together a system that promotes an enjoyable playing environment on the Rathe and one that benefits all parties involved, NOT JUST YOUR OWN! You may not get everything you want out of any system implemented but if things are done in a timely matter with some tact, respect and integrity, you will get most of it.<br>

18 to 30 toons- 1 day hate 1 day fear, 2 days sky<br>
31 to 48 toons- 3 days alotted for fear and hate, 2 days sky<br>
48 to 66 toons- 2 days hate 2 days fear, 3 days sky<br>
66+ toons- 5 days both hate and fear, 3 days sky<br>
<br>
This means that.<br>
5 days in fear + 5 days in hate = 10 days.<br>
3 guilds/ alliances times 66 = 198.<br>
3 guilds times 5 days in 1 plane = 15 days. <br>
meaning 3 guilds get half the month. wrong. <br>
<br>
There's more than 3 guilds / aliances with 66+ people in it.<br>
And i dont understand why a guidl with 31 - 48 toons would get 3 days in fear and 3 days in hate<br>
vrs a guidl with 48 - 66 toons getting 2 days in fear and 2 in hate.<br>
<br>
Main problems at hand other than gods not being dropped on the day they spawn, and guild with less around 20 members or so are posting solo plane dates  and inviting a lot of people.<br>
<br>
Raising their reserving number rights would force these smaller guilds to join with other small guilds ( which they should be doing anyhow ) and posting as 1.<br>
<br>
leaving more space on the calendar for everyone so you go from ...<br>
example, 1 in 45days for a plane raid, to 1 in 30 days.<br>
<br>
Our server is crowded, it cant handle 1 plane raid in over a month for everyone, what makes you think just cause that's a larger guild that they'll go from 1 to 5 days in a plane per month when the guilds with 18 still have their 1 day =)<br>
<br>
Cant add days to the calendar.</font><P><table width="50%" border="0">

I rather like Bradan's idea of raising the minimum to be eligible to post, tho I propose the number be 36.  And the following for days allowed:<br>
<br>
36-48 -- 1 day Hate, 1 day Fear, 2 days Sky<br>
49-72 -- 2 days Hate, 2 days Fear, 3 days Sky<br>
73+ -- 3 days Hate, 3 days Fear, 4 days Sky<br>
<br>
With these understandings:<br>
<br>
1)  Consecutive days cannot include Sat and Sun, with the exception of Sky <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> and</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the agreement of the posting guilds/alliances.<br>
<br>
2)  Can have only 2 consecutive days in Hate/Fear; 4 consecutive days in Sky.<br>
<br>
3)  The number of days a guild/alliance reserves do not necessarily have to be consecutive, but the limit is for future days.  Days that are consecutive must be completed before more are booked.  Once a raid is completed, another raid can be booked.<br>
<br>
For example:  Say KEG has 80 planables.  Today is 30 Oct.  They can reserve Hate for 31 Oct, 1 Nov, and 15 Nov.  Since 31 Oct and 1 Nov are consecutive, once they have completed 1 Nov, they can book 18 Nov and 24 Nov.  When they have completed 15 Nov, they can book 1 Dec, etc.<br>
<br>

<br>
Problem is the amount needed to reserve a day is too small, you raise that, the smaller entity's will ally with other smaller entity's and therefor have more people available for their raid. making the number of entity's go from approx 40 or so down to around 30 which leaves everyone with around 1 day a month or so. that's a lot better than 1 in 45 days. <br>
<br>
We cant solve the problem with overcrowding, only verant can do that. what we CAN do is make the use of &quot; our &quot; planes more efficient.<br>
<br>
basically. 6 guilds of 20 that post reservations once in awhile, would form 3 alliances. therefor reserving 3 days of the month instead of 6.<br>
They'd invite a lot of people anyhow to do these planes for armor and such not to rot, why not just make a posting alliance to do this. not much of a difference other than condensing the amount of days used.<br>
<br>
Those posting reservations would give their name of guild, planeable members of approx 40 or whatever+ and follow the 2/3 rule.<br>
<br>
vrs what we have now.. approx 20 + members in several posting entity's each inviting friends from other posting or non posting entity's and taking up more calendar space.<br>
<br>
problem with 18 or so being able to post a day, we have WAY too many people for that. imagine this.<br>
<br>
20 times 30 = 600 planeable toons feeling a right to post as seperate entity's... well ok.. we have way more than twice that in planeable people on the server.<br>
<br>
40 times 30 = 1200. little closer to the number that we have on the rathe. ( i know there's more ).</font><P><table width="50%" border="0">

<br>
as of now we get a date with fear once every month to month and a half. ( those that follow the calendar ).<br>
<br>
so lets say in our current state, 40 guilds each get 1 day a month to post.<br>
limit those guilds that have 18 - 25 members per posting date, to 40 ( aprox number ), you'll then have 30 guilds looking at 1 day per month. ( approx numbers i didnt examine how many guilds there were exactly, i just know most everyone is getting 1 day in over a months worth of time. )<br>
<br>
If you raise those larger guilds in those 30 guilds on the server able to reserve dates, you're going from 1 day a month and a half, to  1 day a month, and back up to 1 day per month and a half.<br>
<br>
we each have about a day or so a month, give some guilds/alliances more, and you're looking at us still spending 1 day per month and a half or so.<br>
<br>
that WOUlD work if you said, each posting entity had to have about 100 members to post, thus dropping the amount of time between plane raids drastically, and being able to raise it back up so the calendar was full.<br>
^^^ isnt realistic. people wont go for 100 people per posting entity.</font><P><table width="50%" border="0">

<br>
Why? because there are a lot of guilds with around 20 members posting reservations and inviting all of their friends. that's great they invite friends.<br>
<br>
That was 8 months or so ago. we have at least twice the number of planeable people now as we did then.<br>
<br>
&quot; yes we agree on this &quot;<br>
We raise the amount of planeable people per guild/alliance to 40 or so people. At least double of what is required now to be able to reserve a plane date.<br>
<br>
This does not mean those 40 people have to be there.<br>
the only thing required is for them to have 2/3 of the people in zone from their guild / alliance.<br>
<br>
doing this will lower the amount of guilds / alliances making reservations on the calendar, therefor giving us more days than 1 out of every month and a half. which would be approx. getting 1 day out of every month minimum.<br>
<br>
&quot; what you didnt understand from my last post &quot;<br>
<br>
 going from above. <br>
<br>
since we've increased the amount of plane dates every posting entity will get to a minimum of 1 per month.<br>
<br>
If you then take each guild and look at how many members are in each guild saying &quot;70 planable toons should have more days than a guild that has 36 or 40 planable toons. &quot;<br>
<br>
that would mean every guild with XX number of members gets added days in each plane.<br>
<br>
What that would do is decrease the amount of days we get in each plane back down to 1 in every 45 days or so.<br>
<br>
Why? because you cannot post another raid for that plane until your first one was concluded.<br>
<br>
Now, if you did change that to your guild having enough planeable toons to post more days per month, what you're then doing is eliminating the guilds that only get 1 plane day per month out of enough plane days.<br>
<br>
Example, 30 guilds/alliances are posting reservations.<br>
how can, lets say 6 guilds, post more than 1 day in that month if a month only has 30 days in it.<br>
<br>
30 guilds/alliances times 40 planeable members in each = 1200 planeable people.<br>
We have more than that reserving planes as it is now.<br>
<br>
posting entities wont be able to post more than 1 plane day a month with how crowded our server is.. i dont see that happening. if we alot more days per larger guild, then some guilds are left without being able to post on the calendar due to the &quot; rights &quot; of the larger guilds / alliances of being able to post more than 1 day.<br>
