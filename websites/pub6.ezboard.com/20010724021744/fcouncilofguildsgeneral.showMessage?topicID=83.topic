<br>
!st time in<br>
The first part to the 2nd bridge was easy enough for our numbers the first time in.  It was there that we encountered the triggered runner.  3 gnolls and some snakes guard this bridge.  The last gnoll instead of dutiful coming along instead turn around and ran into his home.  Soon later a bunch &lt;many&gt; came boiling up and proceded to spank us completely.  Corpse recovery went very well, much thanks to both clerics Mulloc and Aella for their work.  And also the many that helped pull corpse back for those that needed. <br>
<br>
2nd time in <br>
We continue in and where we had failed before we meant with success.  We then went to the left and then went for a group of 5 gnolls at the paw.  Some how once again we met a similair size boil of gnolls coming from behind.  Many die again &lt;sigh&gt; my group gates to E Karana, thanks Sam. 2nd corpse recovery, but wait it gets better, this was the last CR we had to do this day.  <br>
<br>
3rd time in<br>
We pare down to 3 groups at this time, and instead of turning left we go right and head for Ishva Mal this time.  We easily got to Ishva Mal's place but he was not at home.  Next we went to visit Tesch Val Kadvem, easy for us to do.  At this time we were down to 2 groups and next on our visiting list was Nisch Vil Torash.  Unfortunately none of these 2 had even their common drops &lt;sigh&gt; for loot.  <br>
<br>
We then decided to head for the outside and visit the jail so the paladins could do their sword quest thing. We got this done and headed outside to see the sun again.  <br>
<br>
Loot taken, split paw preserved eyes, spilt paw tanned hide, lots of fine steel, a gnoll hide whip thing, and split paw hide gloves.<br>
<br>
As far as getting ready I would commend all there, we had 18 there before 1:30 cst and all 30 were there at 2 or shortly there after.  This is very good and very important and deserves notice.  We had alot of tanks and could have used more casters.  Hate to say this but 2 enchanters and 2 clerics ain't enough &lt;grin&gt; more shamans druids, wizards/mages too.  We had enough tanks for another group really.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for the time out everyone that was there, it was a pleasure and honour to lead such a fine group of Karana citizens.  <br>

Belce, you did a grand job of coordination and communication. I had the distinction of grouping with some of the finest players I've ever met on this hunt. Here's a few observations.<br>
<br>
Communication: Very good most of the hunt. Tells from Belce were short and to the point and he understood my own abreviated tells. Every thing he told me, I passed immediately to my group, and I think most of the time everyone knew the immediate course of action. Additional information was passed via /say and /shout, but really these were at a minimum during the time when we had 30 people in the raiding party, becoming a bit more common once we were down to 3 groups. Stragglers were few and far between, with the entire party moving as a cohesive, organized force most of the night. Things didn't even fall apart when we were &quot;banzai'd&quot; by the gnolls at the bridge. The groups were still together and working as teams during both battles when I went down, which admittedly was fairly early on.<br>
<br>
Healers: We were severly hampered by a lack of healers during the first two assaults. My group had only me, with no secondary healer. Most of the other groups also had a single healer. It worked fine most of the night. With judicious casting, it was easy to avoid agroing the outnumbered mobs. Once we joined the large-scale battles is where the deficiency really showed up. With no secondary healer, you got two shots at keeping your tanks going, then you died. Once we were down to 3 groups, my group had three healers, one of which was an excellent cleric (thank you again, Aella) and we had no trouble at all from there on in. I know this point has been beat to death, but it very well could have made the difference in the two failed attempts. All the &quot;on me&quot;s in the world won't help if there is no one to keep you standing until the tanks can do their work.<br>
<br>
Those were really the only two things I wanted to bring up. Again, thank you to everyone I grouped with on the night. I had a great time, met some outstanding new people, and learned a great deal about what it takes to point that many people all in the same direction. Let's do it again!<br>
