If not then Dain is Still NB's as it was agreed a long time ago that since he became spawnable its courtesy that anyone who see's him up will inform the rotation guild (since VOF could go in kill him at 12 make it as a kill then joe smuck can come in at 1 and spawn him and he be unknown to be respawned already). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kenaukamikaze>Kenau Kamikaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF - GL</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/11/02 12:58:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=227.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dain</span><hr size=1> NB killed him so that's np. But actually I did not inform NB the first time I saw him up (sunday) since I figured they would check themselves because they were up for him and NB knows, as well as anyone else, that he gets popped a lot. So I thought they woulg keep a close eye. <br>
Later on I got a tell from another NB member who contacted me because I contacted Winkin about this. (I then had already posted this message here) I cannot remember the name off hand. He /she said that Dain is not a *critical mob* for NB. So that would explain why NB does NOT keep close tabs on him spawning. Still I think NB should check regurarly when they are up, espcially if it's over a weekend.<br>

Whoever told you that (if that was truely said) did not tell you the truth.  We have several pro-Coldain alts logged in his room to check on him and do so when we are up for him.  While it is true we are trying to get off Dain rotation, it is not because he is not important, because we still have some guildies who want his belt above all others and as is our way, we will take care of them.  If that is what the person who told you that “he is not critical for us” meant, then either he/she or you misinterpreted our intent/priorities.  Dain is a 20-45 minute raid for us for one of the better belts in the game, he is definitely important to us.  As I said in the other thread, this wasn't through dereliction of duty on our part, we had *just* killed him during the week, and were not expecting to be up for at least a few days, even with his spawning more often.  I didn't notice we were up for him on the RTA rotations board (which I check daily) - so I can only assume the error occured there.  Either the RTA board not being updated properly, or me somehow missing the update.  If I know we are up for Dain, we have the means to check him, and do so often.<br>
<br>
In the future, if you want to know what mobs are critical for NB, please talk to me or in my absence Milambus.  Random members whose names you can't recall do NOT speak for NB.  On days we have more important mobs to do (and thus won't have time for him), I have and will in the future, pass him in a timely manner.<br>

I do understand those people were not officers, since they told me so. Just to show that indeed was said that Dain is not a critical mob for NB, since you doubted my words.<br>
I am fine with it that he got killed by NB anyways and that you could have missed that you were up for him. It's np.<br>
Next time I will make sure to let you guys know the first time I see him up and it's your turn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

He is important enough for us to check on if we know we are up, however, he is not the most important mob we do.  So I don't think Mianiel was lying, but I do think it was a subjective difference in what those words mean.  It seemed like you implied some nameless person (now known to be Mianiel) said we didn't bother checking on him because he isn't critical for us, when it was actually that we didn't know we were up.  Knowing Mianiel as I do, when you asked about it, he probably went to the RTA Rotation board which by then showed us as up, but Dain due the 13th (using Mianiel's listed date in your log).  We didn't kill anything of significance on Sunday that I remember, so a Dain would have been a welcome raid. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>
