<br>
you keep using accountablity as your cornerstone for you diluted argument, but you keep changing the focus of accountabilty.<br>
<br>
Of course im accountable in emails if i attempt to conjur up some illegal master plan to take over the world with my cohorts...  of course im accountable to sony if i plan to train someone, or cheat the game in /tells, /group, /guild, /channel etc..<br>
<br>
however, i am not accountable to the federal government if i share virtual video game mobs over email, lol?!<br>
<br>
i am also not accountable to sony if i /tell, /group, /guild, /channel a way to share video game mobs, lol?!<br>
<br>
if we chose to use a message board format to share video game mobs, then we are really only accountable to each other, which by defintion we are - because we are discussing, debating, and then agreeing on how we want to share things we only have access to..(i believe i've already admitted/lead the argument that choosing to set up the foum in the method it was created was a bad idea, however i still argue that the content of the forum is not the problem, the method in which the hosting of the content is -- this is what i believe you are unable to separate)<br>
<br>
when the next guild gets EP access, we will then be accountable to them, and they will likewise be accountable to us..<br>
<br>
the mafia tradeskill consipracy theory has nothing whatsoever to do with the RTA.  The tradeskill items drop from exp mobs, which are not on rotation.  They are un-monitorable...much like trying to hammer out a RTA sanctioned rule on what each guild should do with a blue diamond every time they loot one in the plane of hate..ie: absurd.  The decision for what to do with tradeskill items is handled on a guild by guild basis. What NB chooses to do with tradeskill items is 100% none of my business; what BotS decides to do with our tradeskill items is 100% none of NB's business.<br>
<br>
The cockblock thread in the rotation forum was created by someone not even in one of the 4 guilds who are discussing rotations!  It is a 20ish line post, a joke, with ~5 replys of &quot;hah hah, cute&quot; then wraps up with a few &quot;hello&quot;s exhanged from an ex-rep who is retired.<br>
<br>
The other 45 some odd posts consist of 300+ word threads ironing out the logistics of spawns, spawn times, zones with mobs that reset on patch, zones with mobs that don't reset on patch, zones with blowable triggers, zones w/o blowable triggers, how long we all think is a fair amount of time to complete each cluster of mobs in various zones, how we want to cluster these mobs - per zone, per mob, per chunk of mobs.<br>
<br>
Are you suggesting we need to be accountable for a humor post in the EP rotation forum, that wasnt even created by a member of the 4 guilds who are trying to set up the rotations?  Are you suggesting that humor is not allowed whatsoever there?  Are you suggesting we be accountable to you, so you can ensure we are creating fair rotations? Again, by definition, there is absolutely no way you could possibly know if we were being fair or not, as you do not have access to the zones that contain the mobs in question.<br>
<br>
So, again: what exactly could possibly qualify you to make sure we are accountable during our discussions of sharing mobs that you know nothing about?  What again, are we (the 4 EP guilds) to be held accountable for by the rest of the server?  I have no idea, and i honestly don't think you do either.<br>

<br>
THE POINT IS ...who are you accountable to Emil?  In the case of an Elemental Forum that exists on the RTA boards in which you 'supposedly' share virtual video game mobs ...who the fuck do you answer to?  Someone HERE has the right to have access to your precious little playground forum to make sure that the topics you discuss in that forum is not detrimental to the community.  <br>

<br>
Of all the possibilities of what a discussion titled &quot;rangerboriana - let the cockblock begin&quot; could be about, I'm 100% sure, it's not about rotation mobs in the elemental planes.<br>
<br>
It isn't just your own little private discussion forum to chat amongst yourselves regarding just rotations mobs in the Elemental Planes ...it is your own little private discussion forum, PERIOD.  You do not have the right to have your own private discussion board, period, hosted on behalf of this community without being answerable to the community.<br>
<br>
What part of &quot;forum to discuss rotation mobs&quot; and &quot;forum to discuss ANYTHING&quot; do you think we are too stupid to understand and separate?<br>

Progress!  Finally!<br>
<br>
I am EXACTLY suggesting that you ARE accountable for ANY POST in the EP rotation forum that isn't about EP rotations.<br>
<br>
Does it matter to me who it was created by?  (..and yes, I am aware it was created by Roggulbuk, my guild leader.)  NO, it doesn't matter ...because I'm equally sure that *YOU* did not hold yourself accountable to post there saying &quot;This thread is inappropriate for this forum&quot; ...which is EXACTLY what a fair and impartial person would have done.<br>
<br>
You cannot be accountable only to yourselves.  It is not possible.  Accountability assumes some kind of impartiality ...and absolutely no one would ever believe that you are truly impartial to yourself.  It's called a CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  *YOUR* interests against *COMMUNITY* interests ...there hasn't been a person alive since Jesus Christ himself who would punish himself for the benefit of the community.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Are you suggesting that humor is not allowed whatsoever there?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I didn't sit here and play the &quot;we have a right to a private discussion forum in which we will only discuss EP rotations mobs&quot; card ...you did.  So, no, I'm not 'suggesting' that you are not allowed humor ...you already 'suggested' it for me.  I do, however, suggest that you be accountable for any discussion in that forum that does not include the 'sharing of virtual EP real estate' ...so unless your joke goes something like &quot;hey, did you hear the one about the A_EP_MOB_01 who went into a bar ...?&quot; ...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Are you suggesting we be accountable to you, so you can ensure we are creating fair rotations? Again, by definition, there is absolutely no way you could possibly know if we were being fair or not, as you do not have access to the zones that contain the mobs in question.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->...and again, this is not what I'm suggesting at all.  Just as soon as you tell me what mob you are rotating in the thread titled &quot;rangerboriana - let the cockblock begin&quot; ...and Nyca develops some ingenious way of restricting your communication there to JUST EP ROTATIONS ...once both of those occur, this conversation is over.  Until then, the community has a right to know what discussions are taking place there.<br>
<br>
Oh, and where is this 'definition' you speak of?  You know, the one that says anyone not in the Elem Planes is too stupid and retarded to take information, process the information in a logical fashion, and come to a fair conclusion?  Is that on dictionary.com somewhere?  I can't find it.  What word did you find it under?  I'm not wanting to argue the point ...just curious is all.<br>

<br>
THIS MB IS NOT OWNED BY YOU OR THE RATHE COMMUNITY IT IS OWNED PRIVATELY BY ONE PERSON HE/SHE DECIDES WHO GETS WHAT ON THIS BOARD, NOT THE COMMUNITY. WHEN YOU BECOME THE ONE LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS BOARD THEN YOU CAN SAY WHO GETS WHAT AND WHEN THEY GET IT.<br>
<br>
Now incase you are wondering i am not in one of the 4 EP guilds. Do i care what they decide in there, hell yeah, but you know what, I TRUST them. I have been doing RoT mobs for 2 years, when a RoT doea not seem favorble for whatever reason they do discuss it to make changes for the better.<br>
<br>
As for the post you brought up it has been stated IT'S A JOKE. with it being in the rotation section for reps im sure more then just 4 guild reps have seen it since there are more then 4 guilds on rot mobs. now please Riggore STFU AND grow a bloody brain. <br>
<br>
You want to know who has made it hard for small guilds to get anywhere look at SoE/Verrant they made it all FFA, they RTA has brought order to chaos , but im sure by the way you act you like chaos over order, so why dont you just goto another server that is straight FFA, no camps no rots and see how well you do there.<br>
<br>
Honestly Rigg i dont see what you are having such a hard time comprehending here, I'm sure that if they were going to try making it hard for smaller guilds they would be redoing EVERY rotation instead of just EP, and im sure if that was the case Vince would close their forum, since you know HE HAS THAT RIGHT AND POWER.<br>
<br>
OH OH i got a way to make it easy for small guilds now, rotation for emp is now kill  A_RANDOM_MOB_001 in Ssra, that what you are wanting Rigg? You moron, i dont give a dam if you are 50 or 15 you are still acting like a 5yr old with the BS you keep posting for your wannabe arguement.<br>
<br>
Now Rigg go help your guild Dot some mobs feed casters or whatever it is you do during your raids to help your guild out . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vilgan>Vilgan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/23/03 10:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   stuff</span><hr size=1> Reading the bazillion posts by Rig made me think of a post on sociology studied by Microsoft at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://news.com.com/2008-1082_3-5065298.html">news.com.com/2008-1082_3-5065298.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Basically it is studying trends and shows that people with high post to thread volume (i.e. post a lot in the same thread like Rig has here). At one point he states: &quot;Do I like flame warriors? Or don't I? A high reply-to-post indicates a flame warrior, because they tell you you're an idiot and they put all their messages into a few threads--so they also have a low thread-to-post ratio&quot;<br>
<br>
Now who does that remind you of?<br>
<br>
The points have been made, whether you &quot;accept them as valid&quot; or not is 100% irrelevant. How exactly is the &quot;elemental planes forum&quot; going to cockblock anything when the mobs you can cock block with aren't even in the elemental planes? Any guild could stop you from getting into fire by taking 2 groups and nailing a sol ro mini during the day every 3 days. tada no chamber flag, and you would never see plane of fire. Oh wait, the RTA would stop that in a heartbeat. So lets say the elemental planes forum is a mass conspiracy to keep you down. Please define where it is going to keep you down? If it is going to &quot;keep the little man down&quot; once they get into the elemental planes, how exactly is that going to work when as soon as a guild is elemental they get access to that forum and can read everything? And if the big 4 guilds are going to cockblock prior to elemental, when exactly are they going to do it when it isn't already covered by the RTA? Keep blowing HoH trials? Oh wait, every guild capable pretty much has done the HoH trials.<br>
<br>
This whole arguement is silly and I for one will admit I only posted because I like to debate occasionally. There is no more content to be posted, the reasons are clear, understandable, and unlikely to be changed. If it was such a big deal then I'm sure the &quot;elemental forum&quot; could get moved and be hosted privately by any of the top 4 guilds on their own forums, giving the others access. However, there is no need because how you see it or not Rig, you are in the very small minority of people who seem to have an issue with the forum. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jurrasicepoch>Jurrasic Epoch</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FK Rep</span><br>  Posts: 1278<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/23/03 11:13 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://a.domaindlx.com/Gravedirt/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: stuff</span><hr size=1> Any second now Rigorre's going to post and say that this was just some humongous troll-job that everyone kept on biting at <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If you cant trust your own guild leader then fuck if i care if you think we need to be moderated by someone outside the planes. <br>
<br>
We really dont give a shit if you think we should be held accountable for anything we write in there also. The fact is that even if we had people watching over us there, AND if we were debating screwing you all over. What would you do about it? Nothing cause you arent in the elemental planes nor is anyone that could act as a moderator. <br>
<br>
Now i know you are only going to use the pieces of this that you want to quote, because you have tunnel vision and only see what you want to see and for some reason you cannot see facts or give good reasons for your debate. So most likely ill stop posting for your benefit since you wont understand it anyways. <br>
<br>
Oh and nice of emil to actually give you some real ammo. Cause other than that you really have no clue. And that thread was started by Bog, and as Roggulbuk can attest to has nothing but a bunch of us laughing in it cause there is no content in the thread. Do i care that you cant read it? Hell no. Do i care that you dont believe me? Hell no again. Do i think you should trust YOUR guild leader to be fair and impartial and let you know if we are being evil plotters? Yes i do, cause if you cant trust him then you really dont trust anyone. <br>

Well, ahem, getting back to the matter at hand.  Vilgan, that was truly an interesting read, even though it pertained specifically to email usenet lists and not 'community forums' such as these, I could almost see the relationship.  Kudos to you for attempting to attack the legitimacy of my argument by making an assumption based on my post count, more importantly my &quot;post-to-thread&quot; ratio.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the attempt has more than a few holes in it.  For one, you have to believe that people who have nothing to say will say nothing ...all of the time, every time ... and those that truly do provide 'value' will do so ...all the time, every time.  We do not follow such laws here.  Case in point, the practice of 'upping your post count' is alive and well ...or, as I like to call it, the &quot;I like cheese&quot; debate.<br>
<br>
Using the argument of this 'sociologist' ...you also have to believe that opinions of anyone with higher post counts are greater than the opinions of anyone with lower post counts ...an idea that I think most people here can agree is ludicrous.<br>
<br>

<br>
They have done nothing except bring their elite status in game (ie being the only ones in the elemental planes) here, to these boards ...a supposedly fair system for everyone.  Am I arguing that the system is no longer fair because of it?  No ...I like the rotaton and calendar system and whether or not they are allowed to do circle jerks in a private forum will not change that system.  <br>
<br>
My argument is that they have no right to HAVE a private forum here.  They got it by saying &quot;we will only talk about EP rotation mobs there&quot; ...and promptly proceeded to create a thread called &quot;rangerboriana - let the cockblock begin&quot;.  They cannot be restricted technically to talk only about EP rotaton mobs, therefore, they need to be held accountable.  Does this mean, &quot;accountable for topics pertaining to EP rotations mobs&quot;? ...NO ...this means, &quot;accountable for any OTHER topics NOT about EP rotation mobs&quot; ...<br>
<br>
You know, it isn't like we are attempting to set a new precedence here.  Why does everyone have the ability to READ the RTA Representative forum?  Someone, somewhere, somehow made a decision that the RTA Rep forum would be open to read only for everyone.  What was that decision based on?  Who made it?  Where the hell are they now?  I'm not a representative and, frankly, what they discuss is none of my business ...at least in the regard that *I* as an individual have a representative who is willing and able to speak on my behalf there.  For that reason alone, I would truly have no issue if the RTA Rep forum was made password protected, but someone said &quot;no, we need to make it readable by all of the community&quot; ...for whatever reason, but probably in FAIRNESS and IMPARTIALITY to those guilds who are not yet &quot;members of the RTA&quot; ...ie, are on no rotations.  Would those non-members have a solid argument if the RTA Rep forum was made password protected?  I think so, yes ...but I'm just as certain that the resulting response would be &quot;get on a rotation, THEN you can have access&quot; ...<br>
<br>
Does it sound even the least bit familiar?  So, I ask you ...by what basis was the RTA Representative forum made readable to all in the community, where the same exact basis does not apply in the EP forum?<br>

<br>
I think this is where you are going wrong.... your definition of &quot;content&quot;.  The RTA is a forum for the community to get together to work out inter-guild issues, some of which are the sharing of in-game content/encounters.<br>
<br>
It is *not* necessarily a board to share:<br>
1) information about encounters,<br>
2) spoilers,<br>
3) charity,<br>
4) welfare<br>
<br>
nor is it required of any participants to do so.<br>
<br>
So, having private boards for purposeful and targeted discussion about certain things that pertain to only a few specific entities is completely acceptable, IMO, and fully serving in the purpose of the goal of these boards.<br>
<br>
Your statement &quot;to provide a fair and impartial system to share content among all of the member guilds on The Rathe server ...the community of the RTA.&quot; is flawed as well.  You (your guild, your entity, etc) are a member of the rotations that you belong and use the RTA forums to solve differences, policy, and such with those rotations.  The rotations are not RTA, the RTA is the forum where all can come to iron out the issues.  The RTA is a meeting place, basically. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zewt>Zewt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/24/03 1:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: stuff</span><hr size=1> Hey Rigorre...<br>

&quot;To me, it is a 'big deal' ...having such a forum hosted here undermines the entire purpose of this forum board ...to provide a fair and impartial system to share content among all of the member guilds on The Rathe server ...the community of the RTA.&quot;<br>
<br>
What do define as a &quot;member guild&quot;?  According to the way that RTA has worked, you are only a member of any rotations you are on.  This would mean, specifically, that you are not a member of the Elemental Rotations.<br>
<br>
Rigorre stated:<br>
<br>
&quot;They have done nothing except bring their elite status in game (ie being the only ones in the elemental planes) here, to these boards ...a supposedly fair system for everyone. Am I arguing that the system is no longer fair because of it? No ...I like the rotaton and calendar system and whether or not they are allowed to do circle jerks in a private forum will not change that system.&quot;<br>
<br>
Their intention is not to bring a fair system for everyone.  It is to bring a fair system to everyone currently in the Elemental Planes.  They have never stated otherwise, and the RTA Admins and Representatives have defended this position.  You are of the opinion that Rotations apply to all, but they don't.  The Vex Thal rotation has no bearing on VoLS, for example, because they aren't a member of the rotation.  VoLS could not create concrete rules that are fair for Vex Thal because they haven't experienced it.<br>
<br>
Rigorre stated:<br>
<br>
&quot;My argument is that they have no right to HAVE a private forum here. They got it by saying &quot;we will only talk about EP rotation mobs there&quot; ...and promptly proceeded to create a thread called &quot;rangerboriana - let the cockblock begin&quot;. They cannot be restricted technically to talk only about EP rotaton mobs, therefore, they need to be held accountable. Does this mean, &quot;accountable for topics pertaining to EP rotations mobs&quot;? ...NO ...this means, &quot;accountable for any OTHER topics NOT about EP rotation mobs&quot; ...&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you have access to the forum that others do not to have knowledge of what is posted there?  No?  So you're talking out your ass?<br>
<br>
Wait, you say you want a moderator for the forum.  They have one, Rogg.  Oh, but Rogg is your friend and you wouldn't wish that job on him, despite how trustworthy many consider him?  Then who do you want to moderate?  Everyone?  That won't accomplish anything but threads like this.<br>
<br>
Rig, what reason do you think you should have access to the Elemental Planes forum?  To comment on it or have some input into the process, when you have no idea what elementals are like?  I wouldn't hire a plumber for a lawsuit against tobacco companies, as he has no experience in that area.<br>
<br>
The RTA is here to work out problems between guilds, I don't see any guilds complaining about the elemental planes forum, just you and your un-named friends.  If they believe in your argument half as much as you do, then they should easily be willing to post here and defend it.  Just like an election, if you don't vote, you don't count.<br>

It is the point that you don't know.  Do I have say in the way my government handles the sewerage system? NO, because I know nothing about handling sewerage, apart from that which I eject daily onto this board.  Why does this concern you.  <br>
<br>
I have a post count of over 2050.  I have personally raided in all of the elemental planes.  Albeit I have not travelled to the deepest depths, nor have I even seen the elemental gods, I have a character with full elemental access.  Why am I not asking for access? Because it still isn't my business.  I'm not part of a guild that will raid these zones, thus it is of no concern to me.  Nor was it when I still played.<br>
<br>
Is Clan Bashemded realistically going to be seeing the elemental planes soon? This is not an insult, this is a genuine statement - they are not.  When they have killed RZTW, then it will be open to them.  <br>
<br>
You are not entitled to this knowledge, as it would be as useful as Emil sending you tells about necromancers in swahili.  You'd get the context, but fuck knows, you wouldn't know what was going on. <br>
<br>
You're nosey.  Admit it. <br>
<br>
You have nothing to gain from this, and I'm not at all convinced you're doing this for the sake of others.  You don't know anything about the EP's, you would not understand a word in there.  <br>
<br>
Oh, by the way, because I have EP access, my willy is bigger. <p><img src="http://www.mmmonkeybusiness.com/sigs/bogsig.gif">
