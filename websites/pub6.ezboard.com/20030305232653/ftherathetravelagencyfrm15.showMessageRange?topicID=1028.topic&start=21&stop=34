<br>
I just wanted to clear up a couple of misconceptions regarding <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.irreverentsouls.com" target="top">The Order of Irreverent Soul's</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> member Allenon's interaction with Lash.<br>
<br>
Let me first offer our sincere apologies for our members stepping foot in to Fear without checking the schedule- But I'd like to assure you that we were not, nor would we ever encumber a fellow Rathe Guild and their camp for any circumstances.  By our nature, it's in direct divergence of what we're about.  We are a midlevel guild, with several new players who have never been to the Planes- and we're in the &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>uncomfortable growing stage</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;, if you will, to which we are actively searching for new areas to hunt, which is obviously necessary to level and grow.  We don't, however, stage raiding parties or send power groups into an unexplored zone without a great deal of planning.<br>
<br>
What Allenon told you was completely honest and in good faith- he had no reason whatsoever to deceive you.  Earlier that week, a guild member - rather foolishly - thought he would scout out a few new areas to hunt.  He was completely alone; I can assure you that there was no group involvement at that point.  As you would expect, Tikanni (the member in question), was immediately slain.  For the next 3 to 4 hours, Allenon and many of our guild members, (including several other non-guildies who had the goodness in their hearts to help), launched a CR attempt.  -Again, this was days before your conversation with Allenon.  Allenon is an officer in the guild, and functions as our Raid Master; therefore would not attempt to hunt in Fear- and certainly not alone!  Striving to see the CR through (several others died in the endeavor), he naturally stayed behind until ALL of the corpses were retrieved.  Allenon's RL job is at night, and he was already late for work when the last few peeps were making their way safely out of Fear.  He camped right there at the spot, and didn't log in until you heard his shout for help a few days later.<br>
<br>
You see Lash, there was honestly no attempt whatsoever to impead on the RTA schedule.  I will say, I find it highly unusual that you would dedicate so much time and effort to such a thinly based allegation.  Forgive me for saying so, but it really seems to appear that you were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>longing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to find some sort of deceit and drama over this incident.  I apologize if you've been &quot;ganked&quot; before; I can only assume that is why you may be hyper-sensitive to having intruders in the zone.  I would hope that this game is for everyone, but I suppose there will always be those who seek out drama and ill will.<br>
<br>
Alas, perhaps your mindset is better suited for a PvP server.  At least in that respect your boyant optimism of deceitful players outside your guild would better served...<br>
<br>
BTW, our guild's slogan is <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-size:medium;">95% LESS DRAMA</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> than most guilds.  I believe it certainly holds true in this case.  In the future, perhaps you should err on the side of diliberation and thoughfulness first, rather than doubt and deceit.<br>
<br>
Godspeed-<br>

AND with no clue as to who the perps were. Can you see why she might have thought that this CR was a result of an attempt at stealing mobs from a scheduled guild? Especially in light of past experiences? If these people were attempting to sneak in unscrupulously, this would have been our first chance to catch the buggers in action. It hardly seems that Lashad is &quot;longing&quot; for drama. She is rightfully, in my mind, bringing up a possibly questionable situation. You say that your guild slogan is &quot;95% less drama.&quot; Is the 5% more drama spent in telling people they appear to want to stir up &quot;ill will&quot; and are more suited to PvP play?<br>

In all seriousness, Sin- I'm only trading flamage with ya.  I agree with you wholeheartedly that words mean so little when it is our emotion that truly speaks volumes.  So, No (real) offense, my friend.  My tongue-in-cheek rebuttal is simply aimed at your words. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I wish I could have the honor of meeting both you and Lash someday- I'm sure in truth, we all share the same mindset, to have fun, and take care of our own.  In all honesty, if had the roles been reversed, I'm sure we would have much the same concerns that Lash has.  As I said earlier, I aplogize for our encroachment in the zone without following the proper channels.<br>
