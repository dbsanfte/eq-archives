<br>
ok .. gonna try my best to keep this civilized here.<br>
<br>
about 2 weeks ago some guildies and i hear that Lodi is up so we rush over to IC. another guild is there and claiming it as a camp, and they have it camped. after some discussion we decide that whoever agroes Lodi gets him. shortly after Lodi spawns close to the other guild and they engage and we back off, pull up a cozy iceberg and watch the fight.<br>
tonight i run my war to the bazaar and decide to port over to IC to see if Lodi is up. when i find him up, i holler it in /gu and we head over. when i get to Lodi, he had obviously been agroed cause he was way up near the tower, but as i get close to him i pause, check his hp's, full .. look around for anyone else, no one ..  and walk up to him as he's wandering around and he agroes me (didnt hit him or anything).<br>
so i start to run him back to the rest of the guild and we start in on him. during the fight, my war who was MT goes down (along with a druid i think). so our ranger kites him around while my war gets rezzed and loots his gear. after gear is looted the ranger yells something about people attacking Lodi and so we all run up to where our ranger was. sure enough, the people who had been there before and agroed him were on him again.<br>
well, long story short, we were too busy trying to figure out what they were doing in /ooc that they killed him.<br>
so my question is this ..<br>
is Lodi a camp?<br>
does Lodi go to the first people to agro him even if they wipe?<br>
does Lodi go to whoever can get the most dmg. in 1st to get the KS (as said guild suggested)?<br>
does Lodi still belong to a group or guild if they are kiting him?<br>
<br>
this is the 3rd or 4th story ive heard in the past couple of months concerning Lodi. is there any way to clear this up once and for all?<br>
<br>
i know Lodi prolly isnt considered a very important mob anymore. but still worthy of being clarified IMHO.<br>

<br>
Lodizal belongs to the first person/group with a force capable of killing him, that engages.  If they wipe .. then he's actually a free mob who is not being engaged.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>does Lodi go to whoever can get the most dmg. in 1st to get the KS (as said guild suggested)?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Refer to above response.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>does Lodi still belong to a group or guild if they are kiting him?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No.  Kiting does not count as 'engaging' on the mob.<br>
<br>
Note:  There are no server rules set for the Lodizal spawn, it's been a subject brought up many times and there's basically a gentlemen's agreement to it, to handle it as any other race spawn I believe. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=35287">Aandiian</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

There is no camp for him as such but people camp there for the spawn but it doesnt give them priority on loddy..if they dont have the people there first then its tough luck.<br>

<br>
Basically, Lodizal is FFA until someone engages him or pulls with the intention of engaging. If someone has agro, but is just kiting it around, I would have no worries with someone running in and taking it.<br>

If there is no one actively meleeing Lodi then he's FFA pretty much (unless there is some class that can solo him now) If you feel the need to run Lodi, good for you. Don't get mad when people come in and damage him in an attempt to get agro to engage and he starts summoning you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nyca>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Singing Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 1297<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/11/02 2:41:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/slllyonec/EZemo/LeahHarp2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Whats the deal with Lodizal?</span><hr size=1> Jaredd said:<br>

how many guildies did you have there?<br>

why didn't the &quot;rest of the guild&quot; keep fighting Lodi, instead of stopping to watch the warrior loot his stuff?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arianrhodsidhe>Arianrhod Sidhe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>S4H - GL</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/11/02 3:09:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=383.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Whats the deal with Lodizal?</span><hr size=1> So far the determination of whether he's FFA or not at the moment seems to be player determined.

They define Kill Stealing as attacking an ALREADY engaged mob and out damageing those who had already begun attacking, thus stealing the kill.  As previously stated by others in this thread, Lozidal is a FFA mob, First group of people to engage have rights to the mob untill either IT or THEY are dead.  Kiting the mob prior to a group engagement is not a valid &quot;engagement&quot; in the eyes of the RTA, but unsure as to how a GM would view it.  <br>
<br>
Lozidal can be killed by a mage and a shaman now.   It has been reported that shaman's have soloed Lozidal.<br>

Good luck with the death of the oversized turtle.<br>

Why?<br>
<br>
Because Lodi summons. Unless the suggestion is that the group did less than 400 damage to Lodi before they had to kite him, then he will be summoning and eating your kiter. <br>
<br>
I wouldn't be surprised to see or hear of a shaman soloing him, so theoretically a shaman could lock him down while people rez'd in, but really, if a group had to &quot;take a break&quot; by kiting... no, I don't think it would be kill stealing to take that lodi from them. Why not?<br>
<br>
Because they obviously havn't damaged the damn thing, and all they are doing is, ACTUALLY kiting the mob, which means J&amp;S. <br>
<br>
Kiting is not an engagement. Pulling to a kill group, fine, but your kill group can't be halfway accross the zone or porting in as you &quot;pull&quot; to them. <br>

<br>
and yeah, fairly easy for a shaman with torpor to solo him. <br>
