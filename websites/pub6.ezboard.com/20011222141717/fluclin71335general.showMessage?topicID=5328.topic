I sometimes truly think that the best American trait is our ability to laugh at ourselves and to find humor in almost any situation.  This is further proof.  *********************************<br>

RECENT QUOTES FROM THE AIRWAVES <br>

&quot;CBS News finally received anthrax in the mail. As usual, we're number three.&quot; -David Letterman <br>

<br>
&quot;Last night the Taliban offered to release eight Westerners if the U.S. promised not to attack. The State Department declined but thanked the Taliban for the offer, saying it really felt good to laugh again.&quot; -Tina Fey on Saturday Night Live's &quot;Weekend Update&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;President Bush continues to have the highest popularity rating of any president ever, current rating 130 percent... In fact, Al Gore carries in his wallet a picture of him and Bush at the debates and says, 'Yeah, I know him. We used to hang out.'&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;Today President Bush urged all Americans to be patient with the war on terrorism. I think we're pretty patient. Election day took what, three months?&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is lobbying now to stay in office another three months. And today Clinton said, 'You can do that?'&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;Today in New York, we had the primary elections for mayor. To improve their <br>
chances, all five candidates changed their name to Rudy Giuliani.&quot; -Conan O'Brien <br>
<br>
&quot;People want to say there isn't racial profiling at the airport, but let's be honest. If you first name is Mohammed, and your last name isn't Ali, leave a little extra time.&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you remember the good ol' days when Congress was only unsafe if you were an intern.&quot; -David Letterman <br>
<br>
&quot;The big question now is who will take power in Afghanistan once the Taliban is defeated. I was thinking, how about Al Gore? He's not doing anything, he needs a job, and he's already got the beard.&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;Things have really changed here in Hollywood. Used to be people in this town couldn't wait to get an envelope full of white powder.&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;Postal inspectors have been given advanced warning that Publishers Clearinghouse is sending packets of laundry detergent that could be mistaken for anthrax. Oh, good timing. What genius came up with this promotion? What's next - a ticking alarm clock?  Let's put that in a box.&quot; - Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;More and more news coming out about this Osama bin Laden guy. He's 6'5&quot; and has 42 children. Or, as the NBA calls him, a rookie.&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;The Mirror interviewed one of Osama bin Laden's sons and said bin Laden has 42 children. That's going to happen when you sleep in a different cave every night.&quot; -Jay Leno <br>

<br>
&quot;Clinton and Dole are joining forces to raise $100 million in scholarship money for the families of the victims. But you know who also deserves a pat on the back, Elizabeth Dole. Her husband is on Viagra and he's gone on the road with Bill Clinton - that is one trusting woman.&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;It's a tough time to do humor, but it's not the only tough time. There have been other tough stretches in comedy.  Remember a couple of years ago when President Clinton stopped dating for a couple of weeks?&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;Now this really annoys me; all these people getting on the Internet and saying Nostradamus predicted this. If Nostradamus were alive today his name would be Miss Cleo and he'd be charging $2.99 a minute.&quot; -Jay Leno <br>
<br>
&quot;People are being much, much nicer to each other in New York. And I have to be honest, it's kind of weird. The other night at Shea Stadium, instead of yelling 'You suck!' at the Braves, Mets fans were yelling, 'Others are better than you!'&quot; -Conan O'Brien <br>
<br>
&quot;This Osama bin Laden guy, spoiled rich kid worth $300M. I have three words for this guy: Anna Nicole Smith. We send her over there, she'll get his money, he'll be dead in a week.&quot; -Jay Leno <br>

FOCUS ATTENTION ON NO ONE IN PARTICULAR<br>
<br>
&quot;We Must Ask Nebraskans, Not Just Middle Easterners, What They Know&quot; <br>
<br>
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) — Sensitive to accusations of profiling specific groups, the Justice Department today announced that the American Civil Liberties Union has taken over the lead role in the terrorism investigation, a shift in strategy that frees up the government to conduct a less prejudicial, more inclusive probe that should take, roughly, forever. <br>
<br>
  <br>
&quot;Instead of un-Constitutionally targeting specific groups, our investigation will expand the pool of interviews by more fairly including people of every ethnicity, every religion, every gender, and every sexual persuasion,&quot; said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero. &quot;Right now, we are interviewing Caucasian farmers in Iowa, legally blind Wal-Mart employees in California, and gay Latino package store customers in Florida to see if they had contact with, or were involved with, those from the Middle East who carried out these attacks.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;For some reason, we haven't learned a thing so far,&quot; Romero conceded. &quot;But I should note that we have yet to speak to Chinese-American loggers in the Northwest.&quot; <br>
<br>
Using the new approach, the ACLU estimated the investigation will cost $2 trillion and take 750 years to complete. <br>
<br>
And now, on to the dreaded... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
ACLU INTERROGATION ROOM: <br>
<br>
ACLU: Well, Mr. X — we call you Mr. X. to protect your identity. <br>
<br>
Suspect: But my name is... <br>
<br>
ACLU: Shhh... shhhh... none of that. We don't need to know. You are not a suspect. Now, Mr. X., what brings you here? And feel free not to tell me. <br>
<br>
Suspect: I want to confess. <br>
<br>
ACLU: Confess? Why? Have you been coerced into giving this confession by any government agency or official? Have you been threatened by any individual or entity with imprisonment, deportation, extradition, or the abrogation of your rights to freely participate in commerce? <br>
<br>
Suspect: No, it's just that... <br>
<br>
ACLU: Wait, did I coerce you into this? For the love of the First Amendment, say it wasn't me! <br>
<br>
Suspect: It wasn't you. <br>
<br>
ACLU: Ah, but you wouldn't tell me, would you? Classic trapped-suspect syndrome. You feel caged. You're afraid I'll rough you up and no one will hear. Mr. X, I'm sorry, but I must recuse myself from this interview and turn myself in to the authorities. You're free to go. <br>
<br>
Suspect: But I don't want to go! <br>
<br>
ACLU: Stop, you're torturing me! <br>
<br>
(First interrogator exits, second ACLU interrogator enters) <br>
<br>
ACLU: So, Mr. X, I understand you came here to confess to something. <br>
<br>
Suspect: Yes. I wanted to say... <br>
<br>
ACLU: Not so fast. First, I would like you to read this pamphlet we've prepared on your rights during an interview. It explains the kinds of tactics interrogators are likely to use to coerce you into confessing or divulging information. It explains your rights, particularly your right to remain silent. <br>
<br>
Suspect: But I don't want to remain silent. <br>
<br>
ACLU: Damn, my predecessor really worked you over, didn't he? <br>
<br>
Suspect: No no. Listen, you don't understand where I'm coming from... <br>
<br>
ACLU: Oh no you don't! We don't care where you come from. You are not here because of your background or who you know or what you believe. Those are private, Constitutionally protected matters. <br>
<br>
Suspect: Look, I came here to tell you that I am one of them! <br>
<br>
ACLU: One of who? <br>
<br>
Suspect: The terrorists. <br>
<br>
ACLU: Please don't use that term. It's wholly a matter of perspective. Wait, let me turn this powerful lamp on. There. <br>
<br>
Suspect: You're shining it in your face. Aren't you supposed to shine it in my face? <br>
<br>
ACLU: Either we are all subject to the harsh glare of accusation, or none of us are, Mr. X. Now continue. Or leave. Totally up to you. <br>
<br>
Suspect: Well, I think what I did was wrong. <br>
<br>
ACLU: That's really a matter for the courts to decide. Is there any admissable evidence of your alleged guilt? Wait, I move to strike that from the record. It's a leading question. <br>
<br>
Suspect: But I do have proof. I have tapes, and printouts of emails, and photographs of all of us at our al Qaeda graduation, and at a strip club in Boca Raton. That's me with under the table there, with the g-string on my head. <br>
<br>
ACLU: Attending a strip club performance is protected under freedom of expression. <br>
<br>
Suspect: But there's more. I can also tell you the identities and whereabouts of many more of the conspirators. Here, I have written their names on this piece of paper. <br>
<br>
ACLU: Really Mr. X, I don't know who you think you're dealing with, but you cannot seriously expect us to act on this information. <br>
<br>
Suspect: Why not? <br>
<br>
ACLU: This list is completely devoid of diversity. I see no Rogers, no Carmelas, no Mary Jane Jablowskis. <br>
<br>
Suspect: That's because there were none. <br>
<br>
ACLU: Unless you provide us with a more heterogeneous list, there's nothing we can do. <br>
<br>
Suspect: So, what, you're not going to arrest me? <br>
<br>
ACLU: Arrest you? All right, that's enough! Who sent you here? <br>
<br>
Suspect: What? <br>
<br>
ACLU: Oh you're good. You're damn good. Who sent you to check on us? Human Rights Watch? Greenpeace? Well, you can tell your tree-hugging superiors that we'll be interviewing Antarctic whales, too! And the Japanese fishing fleet! <br>
<br>
Suspect: But I came here because I'm guilty. <br>
<br>
ACLU: Wrong, you are innocent until proven otherwise. Now get out of here! Or stay where you are and exercise your right to freely assemble! <br>
<br>
Suspect: You're nuttier than the FBI. <br>
<br>
ACLU: I know. We're trying to get that added to the Bill of Rights.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=5339.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=5338.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.emailToFriend?topicID=5328.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.threadControl?topicID=5328.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5328.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5328.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
