Akurra, somebody from Torvo who has more than two IQ points to rub together. I've been trolling around all day trying to find a flamer of your cailber to reduce to a blubbering pile of goo. Is that all you have, from your whole server? ONE good flamer? You fscking gimps.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Sorry, the proof is in the pudding as the saying goes. count the number of posts started by luclin members dedicated to the torvs. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I counted our front page. there are 12 separate posts started by the Torvons out there at the moment. That's a flood in my book. If you cretins had the brains to start a single thread and stick to it we might be having some really good flames by now. As is, I'll have to make due with your halfassed attempt. That's strike one for you, chump. You're flooding our boards. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  number 2. the homosexual jokes have come almost exclusively from your quadrent. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Bzzzzt. You started it, shi.thead. God, you're fscking dumb. Did you miss the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>&quot;I seen this, and it reminded me of you Penis's over here&quot;</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> post that started the whole homosexual bit in the first place? You brought it up, you brought it over, and the majority of your replies are variants on typical highschool homosexual humor. That's strike two for you, assbait. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  All you have come up with so far is &quot;u r gay&quot; and &quot;u can't spell&quot; sorry but that's it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Is your monitor working? Can you read English? Have you read the threads your friends are posting? Those are YOUR flames, di.ckhead! The confused responses all saying things like &quot;lame&quot; and &quot;best you can do?&quot; are OURS. You don't even know who is playing on your team! And yes, my god, your server lacks in english worse than Asura does. Unbefsckinglievable. Sucks to be the sucker working at McDonalds after dropping out of high school, doesn't it. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  this post is one of the only attempts at a real flame (also, the fact you would ban someone on the grounds of troublecausing in the area designated as &quot;rants and flames&quot; proves you are a peaceful server (nothing wrong with that) and a post like this proves it <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Luclin is fairly peaceful in game. The vitriol is in this forum. We ban anon jackoff posters with nothing useful to say and nothing to add to our flaming experience. You are certainly in no danger, however your friends are definitely going to be going away soon. We can't wait for them to evolve thinking minds, we'd all be dead by then. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  as for the little 'training' thing, you are obviously incapable of distinguishing between what is serious and what is not. no idiots, other than perhaps yourselves, would flame eachother all day, its counter-productive. half of the flames are us merely joking around, and the other half are actual, well-put together (not to mention much needed) flames. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Oh you dumbshit hypocrite... look at your own flame boards, they are an exact mirror of ours, along with half the servers out there. Perhaps your illusions have blinded you to the similarities. You've no high horse to come down from. That's strike three.<br>
<br>
Joking around. Hah. Proof you have no concept of the proper structure of a flames and rants board.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  also, the fact that a flame called &quot;spank my penis&quot; is on ur no. 1 list for the reason of the number of posts it has (of all things) proves the fact that your flames are totally meaningles. It's a stupid flame, just for the sake of flaming. You'll rarely find those on our boards. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Well, I happen to agree with you 100% about the penis thread. It's shi.t, but OUR lame flamers (we have some we still didn't ban, yes) won't let the damn thing die. Go read Derakor the Vindicator for some prime Luclin flamage. Guess this proves you aren't completely stupid. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Yes your mod's whining. yet you are as well, as shown in this feeble attempt to take appart my post. see 1st paragraph, all u've come up with is &quot;u r gay&quot; and &quot;u can't spell&quot; and, in this case, &quot;leave us alone, brutes!&quot; *sniff sniff* yup those are balls roasting alright, but look! it appears I&quot;M holding the match under YOUR balls. imagine that. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> You'll need a prime quality H-Bomb to roast balls the size of mine, my friend. I'm a little disappointed that I had to resort to such basic flamage to get a response from you, but you see, since you are new here I don't have much to work with. Thanks for some ammunition. What do you think of this feeble attempt to take apart your post, chump? <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  if you came to torvo to spam our boards, btw, i doubt you would get more than a couple of replies per first couple of posts, and after that they would be swiftly downed to the second page by actual flames from torvo. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I looked at your boards, they are not worth my time. Perhaps, if I decide I need some fun and a good little challenge, I'll write a perl script and put it out on a few random internet IP addresses. At one post each per minute, chances are by the time your Mods notice, 2/3 of your total posts in all of your forums will be scrolled off the bottom, lost forever. That'll leave them several hours of cleanup work to do, at least. Problem is, I know your server is mostly decent people, and we just got the rejects here (namely, you). I've no wish to inflict that kind of @#%$ on someone who doesn't deserve it. Unlike you, I have some morals, and I won't abuse decent boards just for my fun. That's strike four. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  actually, i have much much better things to do than read your whining, so i was unaware of your &quot;bathing slam&quot; (if you consider that a slam, you are in poor shape indeed). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> You used it too, didn't you? You ignorant hypocrite. How hypocritical to claim that a flame you yourself used suddenly isn't &quot;good enough&quot; for you. Hah. Strike five. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Also, the fact that you are lvl 55 proves that you are more obsessed with the game than i am. I have been playing since june of 2000 and i have just over 15 days playing time on my lvl 33 character. Put ur foot in ur mouth AGAIN? wow does it taste that good? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> 55 proves jack, I've seen players attain 60 in less than a month. I'm sure you don't know how to level that fast tho do you... oh well. I'll point out that you are flaming on the message board of a server not your own, and you claim not to care about eq. Your hypocrisy knows no limits, apparently. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Btw, i came here just for a good natured (and totally unserious) flame sesion. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> What the hell do you take this for then? That's exactly what this is! Stop reading so much into things. C'mere, gimme a hug, you big gay teddy bear! /snuggles <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Unfortunately, your oldest people have yet to reach pubescence, so it seems impossible to accomplish such a feat without you leaking several gallons of tears. so here: *hands evilnight a tissue* dry you face. If it makes you feel any better, i'll space out my flames so u have time to recover. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> *grabs the tissue and dabs at his eyes* yes, I'm crying rivers in between the gulps for air... I haven't laughed this hard in some time. Thanks for the good laugh! I'll space mine out too, you'll obviously be typing for hours to come up with something witty to say to this one. Try to remain true to the situation, I detest liars, and you've shown you aren't afraid to use misinformation, since you think nobody is checking up on you. Tsk tsk. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  and dont worry 'bout the door, i'm not leavin quite yet, and if i were, as i'm not fat like you are, i doubt i'll get stuck. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> You mean, you'll stay and play with us? Really? YAY! /cheer<br>
