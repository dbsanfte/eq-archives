It says otherwise. Bill Gates told me he is buying verant when we chatted last night on the phone. He plans to make anything i say law at that point in eq. Just because i say i talked to him doesnt make it true. Were talking about the same verant whose call qeue PURPOSELY hangs up on you and tells you to call back when they are less busy right? Show me facts or get thee gone. I find it hard to believe that all these bigwigs in verant will spare so much time to deal with ONE PERSON's aversion to an agreed player agreement on one single server. They have bigger fish to fry and would not keep spending so much time on it. (which btw verant will always support the majority on a player agreement). So you tell me who is being dilusional.<br>

P.S&gt; no one said anything about punishing you. If youre gonna do it, do it.

In the end it all boiled down to miscommunication. And Alkiron decided to go on a trip, and then he took another trip from the rathe. :)<br>
<br>
If you want semi-FFA/FCFS for the planes, you'd do well to split. It won't be happening anytime soon for the elder planes on Rathe. You can spout your Verant &quot;rules&quot; all you like, in the end, though, you'll get burnt to a cinder.<br>

what you dont understand is that NO ONE HERE cares what you have to say.  You keep fighting and fighting us.  You could tell us that EQ will end tomorrow, and no one will believe you, because your credibility is down the drain.  <br>
<br>
With that in mind, please continue to post as much as you want, because even tho it may be a strong point of discussion for you (who knows, it may just be because you love attention), for the rest of us it is just a way to past time and answer the troll.  The only one wasting your breath here is you, because things will NOT change, unless the majority of the server decides it so IN THIS BOARD (note: i am not talking about your 2000 anonymous unposting followers).<br>

<br>
Some of you should look into trying to debate a differing opinion without the derogatory remarks and childish namecalling.  Trust me, you do not sound cool.  Honestly.  <br>
<br>
I don't think I have to name names, it's quite evident from the posts exactly who you are.  I love a good debate, where people give reasonable, solid, intelligent feedback and counterpoints.  Unfortunately for every 2-3 good posts by people here, it's accompanied by 9-10 pieces of filth and garbage.<br>
<br>
If you can't post your thoughts and ideas, and disagreements without a &quot;()#$* you&quot; in the body of the message, that is very sad.<br>

It wasn't that they were there. It was that they were intentionally training people. You CANNOT be punished for going to the planes outside of your calender system. <br>
<br>
This is correct, you cannot be punished for that.  But the GM can be more inclined to favor one side or the other if a conflict does arise.  And oddly enough, in this instance, a non-BotS bard got lost, trained to the safe spot, and wiped out most everyone in the plane, including BotS who subsequently helped the guild there recover from the train.  Yet they got disbanded.  Funny how that works, huh?  The guild disturbing the status quo got disbanded over an incident that could have been interpreted 20 different ways.  It might have been a train.  It might have been an accident.  But the GM got to make the call.  And this GM had had several run ins with BotS wasn't inclined to look upon them favorably.  Had the GM been on friendly terms with BotS, it would have been written off as an accident, no biggie.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I have this from the head of personell George Scotto in Verant. Also, I suggest you check with your GMS before posting such foolishness. If the GM goes against verant rules then they won't be a gm long.<br>
<br>
There are rules and there are rules.  Do you have any clue how many rules contridict each other and how many leave GM's free to do all sorts of things?  One day a rule is interpreted one way, the next day another.  One day one rule is followed, the next day another.  Running Lodizal around snared matches the defination of engaging a mob.  But GM's don't enforce this.  GM's have so much discretion it isn't even funny.  They can ignore it.  They can warn you.  They can just tell you don't do it again.  Or they can ban you.  All for the same offense.  Chat with Scotto all you want.  He'll tell you or me the exact same thing.  I'm sure I could go ask him about what kill stealing is and he'll tell me the exact same thing the PnP policies say.  And when he is checking on his GM's, he'll happily nod as one resolves a Lodizal conflict by not siding with the guy that's been kiting the mob around for an hour.<br>
<br>
What I'm saying is that GM's have a lot of leeway in how they interpret stuff.  And they like their servers nice and quiet.  Which means that 'troublemakers' are more likely to get in trouble.<br>
<br>
All chitchat with GM's aside, this is reality, both in EQ and real life.  What is said and what is done are often different.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubiasschmias.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bias Schmias</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Glossolalia/CTA</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/13/01 8:19:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: question for jerrica</span><hr size=1> Jamany continues to provide me with endless amusement.<br>
<br>
Nobody has ever claimed this calendar benefits every last person 46+ on the rathe.  that's a straw man, jamany.  You know it and i know it.<br>
<br>
The argument is that the calendar presents the greatest good for the greatest number of people.  If you have a better system and you can tell us what that system is and how it would work better for more people, I'm all ears.<br>
<br>
and you've never had to resort to any harsh language, true.   Instead you have simply threatened people with getting them banned in-game if they say anything that you decide is harassment.  These threats are usually followed by wild claims of people sending you abusive tells and harassment in game, yet you fail to ever provide names or information when anyone here tries to find out more about what happened.<br>
<br>
As I recall, virtually every person who posts here was VERY upset about the fact that you were being harassed in-game or treated poorly by random people.  But after 3 or 4 variations on the same story with no backing details, your cries of 'wolf' began to ring very false to me.  Especially since they always came when you were backed into a corner by the lack of coherence or logic to your arguments.<br>
<br>
That's why I've concluded you're a troll, actually.  I can't believe anyone would REALLY behave this way if they weren't working to push people's buttons in a calculated manner.<br>

<br>
&gt;The entire calender dictates who can and cannot go to the planes so why should you now have a problem with it except that you are now one of the ones that was told you couldn't go?<br>
<br>
The calendar does NOT dictate who can and cannot go to the planes, nor has any calendar admin that I know of told anyone they could not go to the planes.  What has happend for some reason or other is that a &quot;calendar&quot; rule has been violated and that posting entity's &quot;rights to use the calendar&quot; have been suspended.  Not their right to go to the plane, just to use the calendar.  You are correct Jamany when you say you have the right to go when you want.  Everyone does who is lvl 46 or higher.  However not everyone has the right to be a posting entity and utilize the &quot;calendar system&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Ok flame away. Just had to ask that question because it is quite serious. Your calender sets up rules to become a posting entity and then you must post a date on the calender to be able to go to the planes. <br>
<br>
I believe once again Jamany that you are correct here.  No flame for being right.  I think in a nutshell that is how the &quot;calendar system&quot; works.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;So in reality you are saying who can and cannot go. Everything was fine until you told a &quot;posting entity&quot; they couldn't go. <br>
<br>
But see here Jamany, you are wrong. No one told a &quot;posting entity&quot; they could not go to the planes.  Everyone has a right to go to the planes.  They were told that they could not utilize the &quot;calendar&quot; system while under suspension.  They still have the right to go to the planes whenever they want to.<br>
<br>
I hope I didn't make any errors here, if I have someone point them out to me so I can understand a bit more.  And I hope that this cleared that topic up for you Jamany.<br>

This is the type of thing that has kept me posting.  The way I am understanding this is as follows;  if I go to the planes without permission from the calender then I will never get assistance and should be wary of getting a teleport from anyone? <br>

This is not compromising, nor is it debating.  It is all out threats and stupidity.  I don't mind a good debate but the f*** you and the entire childish crap is getting old.  I have tried with all my efforts to keep things in a civil matter.  But instead of getting civility back I get comments like the ones above. <p>JAMANY FUGMZELOR<br>

Though totally different, it could be likened to someone killstealing the AC in Sro from you. Now do you give that person a sow after they stole your kill?<br>

For every action their is an opposite reaction. Or consequences, if you will.<br>

THIS IS ALLOWED. No gm is going to punish me if i refuse to res someone. Ive done it before to a putz who was training people on purpose and died. No one is telling you cant go to the planes. You were just being forwarned that hey all actions have reactions. If you interfere with a raid then yes there will be reactions to that. You show me where its posted that hey you cant make a person a black sheep by Verant's rules. This is a social game, meaning social interaction is required. Just like in rl, if you go around saying hey im going to do such and such in my neighborhood and there is nothing you can do about it or ill call the cops. Fine, but dont expect to be invited to the parties or anything like that. You put a lot of energy into your arguements and i respect that. BUT you contradict yourself a lot. If there was something wrong being done here, the gms would have done something about it a LONG TIME AGO. No one is being refused the ability to go to the planes. This calender is an agreement for people to respect you date and to back you up on it and not interfere with your date. Everything must have a standard and thats what is used here. It could be 20 toons to post and i can promise you that there would be someone griping &quot;You are excluding those who only have 19.&quot; the age old saying that you cant make everyone happy is true. But the calender has succeeded in making the majority happy. Threatening to blacklist you is not wrong. Its harsh, but no more so than running around threatening to try to get people banned for supposed harassment. Both are warranted i would say if the facts dictate it.  SO BASICALLY, the calender ONLY is an agreement to have your day in that plane respected just like a list to get in frenzied ghoul or anything else. Its the same thing except a more in depth list. <br>
<br>
<br>
Something to think on; several camps make lists and will fill in the spots by class.Meaning if the main tank leaves they replace it with a tank even though 3 or 4 people have been waiting longer. Yet i see no one screaming heresy about that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujamany.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jamany</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Fodder</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/14/01 8:38:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Verant</span><hr size=1> You are correct.  There are lists in several zones for several creatures.  However, I have never been told that by not having 20 people to take out the creature I can't be on the list.<br>
<br>
Also, I was not speaking of being blacklisted.  Because that will not effect me and has not effected me.  I am speaking of threatening to have people teleport me to a place where I would be sure to die.  That threat was made in another thread.  These threats are childish.  I do not make threats nor make any statements that would violate the &quot;rules of the game&quot; given via verant.<br>
<br>
I think telling someone they have to ally themselves with anyone just to be able to go to the planes is pathetic.  <br>
<br>
These are just my opinions but although you claim to have over 2000 people agree with this system you only have 762 people signed up on this site.  That isn't near half of the people on the rathe. <p>JAMANY FUGMZELOR<br>

Then you say you won't go to Indy Day, cause you don't want anyone to dictate when YOU can go.<br>

There are more than 762. Seekers of lore has over 150 people (not toons, actual people) in our guild. Our alliance bosts over 100 planable people. this doesnt count the large number that are not planeable yet. In our alliance you can push the total number closer to 250 or so. I refuse to believe we are the only ones like this. Count the posting entities. Im afraid you math is faulty though. there are over 20 posting entities by far. That alone would be 800 people and again thats only planeable and many exceed that number. this is more than your 762 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubiasschmias.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bias Schmias</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Glossolalia/CTA</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/14/01 9:25:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Verant</span><hr size=1> If you are going to take the number of posters to this board at their face jamany, there is only ONE active poster who doesn't support the calendar here.<br>

<br>
You are correct here Jamany, and I will tell you why.  If my guild is in Hate on our scheduled day and a group comes in and clears the Gorgons area, or I'm camping VS and a group comes in behind me and kills him, or I'm pulling wurms in Skyfire and soloing them near the zone and a couple wizards kill steal him from me there will be reprecussions.  Their names will by added to my HUGE list of assholes who no longer get teleports, sows, heals, or the time of day from me.  This is my option and perfectly legal as far as the powers that be are concerned.  And I think 99 percent of the people that play have some sort of list of their own.  If you are camping *yer favorite mob here* and I come in and train you or kill steal you, I bet I get added to your list too.  You seem reasonably intelegent so if you tell me that...&quot;No Anthalas, I'll still love you and help you out.&quot;  I will have to call you a liar.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;This is the same as saying you can't go. <br>
<br>
No it's not the same as saying you can't go Jamany.  If I told you that...&quot;Jamany, you can't go to the planes.&quot;  Then you do this...&quot;/petition Anthalas&quot;.  GM comes and laughs in my face.  No one can tell you that you can not go to any zone that you wish to go into.<br>
<br>
&gt;They have said if you don't use the calender system then beware of ever getting a teleport or any assistance at all because you have screwed the entire rathe community....do you see where I come to my conclusions from?<br>
<br>
Here you are partialy correct,  see my answer above in regards to getting a teleport from me if you piss me off.  But note that I said &quot;me&quot;.  If you come to my camp, no matter where, and ks me or train me, you have pissed me off.  The entire rathe community could care less.  But I will be very pissed at you, and you could forget about getting assistance from ME.<br>
<br>
&gt;This is the type of thing that has kept me posting. The way I am understanding this is as follows; if I go to the planes without permission from the calender then I will never get assistance and should be wary of getting a teleport from anyone?<br>
<br>
If this is what keeps you posting then you have a real fear of being shunned and denied aide from other players.  And if you kill steal from someone or train them, no matter what camp they have then that is exactly what you should expect. <br>
<br>
&gt;This is not compromising, nor is it debating. It is all out threats and stupidity.<br>
<br>
Here you are correct Jamany, if you ruin my game play, NO MATTER WHERE I AM AT, you WILL be added to  my shit list.  You may think that is stupid, but I don't.<br>
