I have to ask this but since I was the one who posted  the logs etc and  proved that SoT were in the wrong , will I too be getting an apology?<br>
 <br>
 I have been told by  several *loyal* SoT members that all I needed to  do was to post internally and  speak in /gu and that  these apologies would have come  then too. Does anyone believe that? <br>
<br>
So to those still in SoT that were hurt ,offended or upset by my  post(s) and/or actions in this matter , I am sorry. I did what <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  I </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thought best at the time and if that was  tactless etc then i am guilty of being so.<br>
<br>
BUT I was still right  in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  what </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I said . I did try to  speak openly in /gu and was told by Shei  basically that since he was leader he could speak freely and more openly then myself . I posted  where i was when  RF  action took place. I was SLAMMED in /gu  for saying  that (look at page one  its only a  cut from log showing me in GD ffs) So i did try.<br>
<br>
At end of the day  myself and Galudina ( and Pahraith)  have come away with our  pride intact and   we can hold our heads up high.But we have also lost  in that  we have no more /gu   and have  lost people we thought were friends in the guild. What a bitter sweet ending this was :/<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  So..I ask ya this..Shei...are you admitting that i was right ,you were wrong and  you are apologising to me? </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ( and Galudina  lets not forget <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
One last word: many thanks to ALL of you that sent tells to myself and Galu over past few days. We had find safe spots to sit  many times to the numbers of tells. I am not exagerating to say we recieved hundreds of tells and channel invites. Several guilds and their guild leaders have shown nothing but kindness to us and we have  really   enjoyed being around you guys. We look forward to   being with you  again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I like you - however the way you bashed our Guild shows lack of pride in guild, and lack of interest in guild.  We wouldn't want someone who thinks the way you do in guild, and i am only making this decision after your post.  Not prior did i think this.  [is my opinion not guilds]<br>
<br>
Your insults, had hurt, and am not sure can be mended.<br>
<br>
We understand what we did was wrong, and an apolgy was made by the GUild leaders who spoke for the guild.  I wouldnt expect an apology to you, someone who took the easy road out of SoT after all SoT has done for you.  SoT came together and is getting through this tough time.  What we did was wrong, we know - but as chokehold said, you are the weakest link.  Only meaning you left and didnt try to &quot;help&quot; OUR guild through a time of struggle.<br>
<br>
Would suggest you read the poem &quot;The road not taken&quot; by Robert Frost.  You and galudina took the road that was more traveled by and not the less.  Whether it be for a moral reason or a honourable reason for leaving, it took more courage for the NUMBER of SoT that were pissed off about the event to stay, and Help the guild through a time of need.  Some left yes, but there is not much to say of them. MANY SOT were VERY mad - however, they stuck with guild and in our meetings people expressed their thoughts and thought of actions, and we needed to apologize, and we did.  You guys left us in a time of need, and for that, and that alone you prolly won't get an apology.  You chose your Moral decision just as many other SoT did - however left before trying to make a mends.  We were wrong, we owned up to it.  And will try to make it better as our officers had stated.<br>
<br>
My best wishes to Dwallyn and Galudina - my only wish was you guys had the heart and love for the guild that i have.  These words spoken as a friend, not as an enemy.  If you two need anything /t me.<br>
<br>
Good luck in your journeys,<br>

<br>
Those SoT who left during this most recent bullshit fest are the ones taking the road less travelled by.  It took a thread of 294 posts to drag the SOT leadership kicking and screaming to the apology - don't offer it now as responsible &quot;taking ownership of one's mistakes&quot;.  This is not an isolated incident.  This was just the most public of many actions SOT has taken in the past year.  For once, the SoT PR machine failed, and you all @#%$ up in such a public way that your usual habit of trying to get everyone to bury their head in the sand didn't work.  I won't even bother listing all the times you have pulled this kind of bullshit.<br>
<br>
You want proof?  Read Thundaron's first post on this matter.  Read Dwallyn's posted logs - this is the essence of SoT most of us have thought existed but hoped was not true.  This is the essence of what everyone is told to &quot;take the SOT bandwagon&quot; bashing with a grain of salt.  Well, you can take your salt back, we don't need it. <br>
<br>
There was a time when SoT and NB were almost sister guilds.  I xped with and raided with SoT countless times in HS, VS raids, Dragon killings, Kedge, planar raids - all with Karadoc, Lazreth, Femke, Rana, Nycah, Thundaron, Cassidy, Shane, Clerise, Pacemaker, etc etc.  Then the decision to become Uber happened around the time SoT first started going for Trak.  The attitude changed, and the lack of respect for everyone else on the server started.  Well, I hope you're happy with how uber you've become, and I hope its worth the pariah status you are now enjoying.<br>
<br>
This isn't a one off mistake SoT made, but a culmination of all they have worked for, and how they treat almost everyone they encounter.  This time, it just happened in such a public venue, with enough witnesses it couldn't be hidden or dismissed.<br>
<br>
Standing by and defending your guild during a &quot;trying time&quot; is commendable.  Supporting one where the leadership is corrupt and incapable of common decency is not.  I would turn you to the AA prayer Malidar:<br>
<br>
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br>
<br>
the Courage to change the things I can,<br>
<br>
And the wisdom to know the difference.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dwallyn, Galudina and Pahraith had that wisdom, and exercised their courage.  You have your serenity.  I think they are the better off.<br>

Those logs were proof that Shei knew what he was doing was wrong at the time, not only that but he apparently felt good about doing it with his gloating. It eliminated any doubt in anyone's mind that this most defiantly was NOT a simple &quot;miscommunication&quot; He went in, he took the mob, he laughed at and mocked the pain of my guild mate.   When I spoke with him the other night, and he said to me &quot;why do you think noble blade was there” I replied, &quot;to help CoN” he didn’t believe me.   He didn’t believe me in the slightest bit, and began to quote a post from noble blade saying they wouldn’t recognize the list.  Not everyone is a backstabber, but apparently he feels that is the way of the world.<br>
<br>
I speak for myself, and not my guild here in saying that I feel his apology was more of a &quot;cover my ass&quot; statement and not a heartfelt apology. Apparently in his statement on our boards he has been feeling the wrath of the Rathe in the harassing tells he and his members have received. He wants it to stop, thus he is posting his apology to try and get it to stop. Had he posted this the first day, before the logs of SoT's guild chat were posted, perhaps I would feel differently. I still feel that he is the scum of Norrath and will not offer my assistance to him, or any of those who follow such an immoral leader.  Politics however, demand that I deal with him in a civil manner when he eventually does meet with us again.<br>
<br>
What I want to know is, what actions are the other SoT leaders taking against Shei for this immoral action? Thunderon, Will you all allow him to do something like this again so long as you can keep it under your hat? Is he allowed to remain in a leadership position of SoT after causing such a nightmare for your guild? You said yourself there are 4 GM's of SoT, perhaps maybe it should be 3 huh? I doubt any action will be taken against Shei, he will be allowed to continue leading his troops into immoral battles. Only time will tell.  <br>

Your opinions are valid - and cannot hold them against you.  We apologized, now its time to move on.  My post wasnt toward the community more towards galu and dwallyn.  Posted here so they could read.<br>

Pahraith however, was on the verge of leaving before this incident, this just topped it off - he was ready to leave before any of this.  He is not in the same boat as galu and dwallyn imho.

Stop the delusion, ok bro?  Read Thundaron's first post:<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll go ahead and make this post but sot will not be replying further to this thread but i want to clear a few things up.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is from a guildleader, not some idle member with too much time on his hands.<br>
<br>
Then read Dwallyn's posted log - or in your case, remember what was said in /gu that night by Shei himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
That would be proof enough that no apology was going to be forthcoming until this thread and the server online reaction boiled to the head this has, isn't it?  Be honest. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><img src="http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif" align="left" border="0"></a>Karadin Firethorne<br>Assassin of The Rathe<br><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net">Noble Blade</a>

I'll talk out of guild now, if Shei had not openly apologized more would have left SoT, not because Shei was solely to blame, but because the public outcry was so big that it was the only way to ever make a chance at making amends, and not many felt comfortable with this situation, Shei was right for writing that apology, for his guild and towards the public, if you wish to discard his apology as a forced apology then that is your view.<br>
Anyone care to show me when Shei has ever apologized before in public? Even before when SoT was being attacked Shei refrained from comments. This time he stood up and did the right thing. That says something in my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukaradin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karadin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NB-GM</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/25/02 1:18:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fine as far as it goes...</span><hr size=1> &quot;if you wish to discard his apology as a forced apology then that is your view.&quot;<br>

<br>
<br>
That isn't forced how?<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes Shei made an apology, forced though it was, and that is a first.  Another first was demonstrated in Dwallyn's log: just how little respect many of you have for the rest of us playing on*your* server.<br>
<br>
Let's hope that along with the apology comes a change in attitude towards your fellow players.  I'm eternally hopeful, but not holding my breath.<br>

No one has denied the content of Dwallyn's /gu log, and that is the most damning part of this whole thing.  Alot withheld opinions or any real sort of judgement until that surfaced.<br>
<br>
The attitude conveyed in that log was more than enough to color any apology as simply a backhanded attempt.  Yeah, it's great that you folks are stepping up and saying &quot;we did bad&quot;.. but I seriously doubt most of the community of this server is going to forgive anything until Trompen is holding a sprinkler, and likely won't forget this incident for a long, long time.<br>
<br>
Speaking for myself... I had no real negative or positive opinion of SoT or it's leadership. I have to say plainly were I to actively play EQ again, I would certainly mistrust your motives in most anything we were both involved in.<br>
<br>
I guess what I am saying is.. Saying Sorry isn't going to go very far right now... It's going to take alot of &quot;Demonstration through Deeds&quot; before anyone starts giving you the benefit of the doubt about your intentions.<br>

What you posted, both on the RTA and in our members board showed, imo at least, that you wanted your moment of fame, and you had no decency to come to us, your guild, first with your issues, but you would rather turn your back on the supposed friends you had in this guild.<br>
<br>
I haven't been on much lately, and I wasn't there when this happened, however reading your posts on the RTA *before* you posted trying to solve anything on our boards makes me lose any respect that I would have for you. Don't come asking for an apology, we want nothing to do with people that are only out for themselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
[q]Standing by and defending your guild during a &quot;trying time&quot; is commendable. Supporting one where the leadership is corrupt and incapable of common decency is not.[/q]<br>
<br>
The leadership is corrupt and incapable of common decency? I have been in SoT for over 2 years, and know every one of those leaders very well.. and that comment is just unfounded. Sure, you can read a log (and to be honest, I skimmed through it, didn't read every detail) and think you know all about a person, but you don't. Shei is a good leader, whether you like him personally or not. You may think he commands us and we just follow orders, but that is so not the case. In fact, I would think it is a more relaxed leadership compared to some other guilds who when the leader says something they do it, and don't think twice. That is not the case. Yes, to be a good leader I think you have to be a tough-ass at times, and Shei does that, but to say that he is corrupt and what-not just proves you don't know him, or any of the other leaders.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udembiredeadbones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dembire Deadbones</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/25/02 2:33:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dwallyn..</span><hr size=1> I'm a little confused, by the logs, it seems to me that having the guildmotd saying what it did, it was a planned KS, especially with Nyca knowing who was camping RF.  RF was being kited by CON already as said in the logs so CON had engaged RF so it is KS'ing outright that SOT did, please correct me if i am mistaking.  I don't think an apology is enough because that does not make up for the time trompen lost.  I am a very rare poster, but i read these eboards all the time, but i remember HC being flamed all the time because of the leadership with SOT being right in there, how is this different?<br>
I think every cleric on the rathe is affected because it delays their time to camp RF and every smaller guild are gonna have to keep looking over their shoulders in hopes that they will not be KS'd as well.  No apologies can fix that, trust is earned not granted.    <br>
Trompen I wish you didn't have to go through the hell you have been through , you are a great person.  Trompen was at tha RF camp last Saturday and Sunday and rezzed myself and my group a number of times without accepting a donation and he volunteered after i ooc for help.  It  saddens me to see someone as giving as trompen to be screwed like he was.  I also feel for the good people in SOT who had nothing to do with this incident but will have a tough time now because of what the leadership and followers of them had done that day. <p><b>Dembire Deadbones<br>

<br>
[Fri Mar 22 17:25:18 2002] Nycahlu tells the guild, 'next time, please don't get my hopes up<br>
<br>
Here we see Nyca truly disappointed her guild didnt KS this RF for her ALT but for a Guildmembers main toon.<br>
<br>
Is it just me? or does anyone else find this disgusting?<br>
<br>
One can only begin to imagine how the minds of the Officers / GM's of SoT works. <p><p><a href="http://www.noble-blade.net"><imgsrc="http://http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/10395.jpg"><br>

<br>
Malidar you say Dwallyn showed a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  lack of pride in guild, and lack of interest in guild </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I really fail to understand how you come to this conclusion? Dwallyn got himself a reputation on these very boards for defending SoT, he stayed with SoT through thick and thin, while we were flamed by BoTs (rightly or wrongly) and others. As for a lack of interest in SoT well that makes me laugh, does staying up until 5 and 6am many nights to help SoT clear NToV (for example) show a lack of interest? does helping folk with epics, quests and 1 million other things show a lack of interest? <br>
<br>
The facts are this:<br>
<br>
SoT decided to kill RF, Dwallyn did not agree, neither did I, but as the  more vocal of the two, he was more outspoken.  In guildchat and tells he was protesting over the formation of a force to kill this camped mob. He was ignored, he was criticised.<br>
<br>
After the kill he again shows his disgust, logs posted here only show a small time frame but if he posted them all they show harsh criticism of the fact that both he and I thought that what happened was wrong, this came from more than a few and included leaders and officers.<br>
<br>
Nine hours after the kill and unable to sleep Dwallyn posts on the RTA, he is not posting in anger he in posting in honor and he is telling the Rathe the truth, that was his right. <br>
<br>
The next morning we log on to a discussion about us in guildchat, we are dirt, we are filth, for Dwallyn did the unthinkable and broke rank. The previous day Dwallyn was told specifically NOT to post on the RTA, this is a SoT tatic for deflating flames thats why you don't see more SoT posts because after any SoT incident Shei or Thundaron tell all members not to post.<br>
<br>
By this time we are still guildtagged and thinking about our position in SoT, neither of us are happy with what SoT has done and are even less happy about how pleased they feel with themselves , the gloating and self rightiousness is sickening.<br>
<br>
We are bashed and bashed and bashed, told we are wrong time and time again. We believe that we are right and that what SoT did was wrong. <br>
<br>
After a lot of discussion and a lot of thinking we decide to leave the guild, I am upset in RL because I know I am losing a guild that I loved and friends that I cherished.  But I feel I cannot stay any longer with a guild whose leadership is so wrong. I hope in my heart that the friends that I made in SoT will remain my friends for I am still the same person I was before I disagreed with what the guild did. I am the same cleric who rezed you with a smile, who laughed with you and cryed with you. But I know and I feel that after such a harsh flaming by SoT of me and Dwallyn for our belief in the truth that things will never be the same again.<br>
<br>
The easiest thing for Dwallyn and I to do would have been to keep our heads down and say nothing, remain with SoT, take the loot and let it ride over our heads.  We have more dignity and pride than that. But it was us who were going to be the losers , losing guild and friends.<br>
<br>
Turns out in the end SoT now think we were right.  Killing RF WAS a bad thing, now how the hell do you think that makes us feel? who is going to turn round and honestly and truthfully say to me and Dwallyn, we are sorry you were right?<br>
<br>
I was upset when we left and Dwallyns goodbye post on SoTs boards was not the nicest he could have made. SoT criticised him for that no end, but what about the insults we got the tells we got, the nasty words SoT members said to us because we believed the RF killing to be wrong? its ok for you guys to insult us but not the other way round?<br>
<br>
My goodbye post was different and I wrote it with tears in my eyes, yes you say this is just a game don't be silly.  It is , but the friendships we form are with real people not pretend ones, thats what makes EQ so addictive in the first place.<br>
<br>
At this time SoT are still saying they are right and to be honest Malidar it was your post (and a request from someone asking him to prove what he was claiming) saying that RF was mezzed for 25 minutes before engagement that prompted him to post logs. Those logs could have been much worse, to start with he could have named members, he didn't, he could have left in things that were said out of context (for example Brumpy laughs at one point at something else and it could be seen to be that he was laughing at the RF thing but he wasn't) It was those logs and those logs only that made Shei post an apology and you know how I know? because friends of mine still IN SoT told me so, the guild knew without a doubt that without proof of wrong doing (like all the other times) the RF flame would die down and go away. One person is even quoted as saying &quot; <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  this one won't go away like the others, DW posted logs on the RTA </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> &quot;<br>
<br>
It very hard for the honest and good members of SoT atm they are been all lumped together, everyone including me refers to SoT and people think it means them, it doesn't mean all of them for some are great people, but its hard to name all names and to single people out as good and bad is not fair.<br>
<br>
Tinol, my husband has more honor and more dignity in his little toe than many will ever have in a life time. YOU and others like you presume too much. Its easy now for you to say, oh he was always a trouble maker blah blah, NO what he was and is, is an honest man not afraid to speak the truth, if that makes him a trouble maker then so be it.<br>
<br>
To answer your question about why I am married to him in real life (not that I should have to) I will tell you this:<br>
<br>
Craig (Dwallyn) is the most tender, honest, loving, selfless, dignified and honorable person I have ever met. Yes I am biased, Yes I would stand by him, but you questioned why I was married to him and that coupled with the fact that I love him with all my heart and soul is Tinol why I am married to him.<br>
<br>
Malidar learn some of the dignity that your father has, hes a good man and has been of great support to  me in tells <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And to the Rathe, THANKYOU, for my loss of friends in SoT has been a gain of friends on the Rathe, thanks for the hundreds of tells, strangers coming over from other servers (amazing) people who I have never met, or spoken to sending Dwallyn and I tells of friendship and support have helped us through this.<br>
<br>
Thanks also to my friends in SoT who stood by me (you know who you are !) and also to Noble Blade and Vof who we have joined on raids these past few nights for your wonderful support and kindness (oh and before you JUMP on them, we made it clear we had no intention of joining any guild at present, so don't think they were just recruiting)<br>
<br>
I knew you would try and deflect the focus of what happened from YOU onto Dwallyn, we expected that.<br>
<br>
SoT need to be allowed to make amends, for Trompen and anyone sending nasty tells (either side) should stop.  Its not your average SoT members fault this has happened. <br>
