<br>
For those who dont know, recently the guild Conquest from another server was completely disbanded, 2 players banned, and about 26 others suspended for exploitation in the Sleeper's Tomb.  Now the alert I'm brining to everyon's attention is that our (almost everyone who does the dragons) current stratagies have been formally acknowlaged by Verant as warnable and bannable exploits.<br>
<br>
The following is an except, the full text can be found on the Gameplay forum of the official Everquest web site or at the following address: boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000210.html.<br>
<br>
[&gt; There really is no in-between on sleepers tomb warders - <br>
&gt; clerics just cant <br>
&gt; take the hits. Yet running Back down the steps at nagafen, <br>
&gt; or back into the <br>
&gt; safe hall on nag or vox remains a perfectly valid tactic and <br>
&gt; isn't challenged <br>
&gt; by VI...<br>
<br>
Again, I believe it IS challenged by us. I just called Michelle Butler and talked to her about this. When they do catch people exploiting Nagafen or Vox in this manner they are warned and often removed from the zone and told they can't do the dragon this spawn. If they are on record as repeat offenders in this area, they are suspended. She also said I was welcome to review warning and suspension logs for this on Monday, so I'll probably take a look at them then. ]<br>
<br>
Now then, I dont care if Conquest was right or wrong.  This isnt the place for that discussion.  However, I am concerned about how we take on Naggy and Vox.  From what I read Verant considers anytime a mob can be attacked without it being able to attack back FULLY it is an exploit.  IE: Vox, its common to keep the healers back in the hallway and run back for heals.  However, I dont believe she can attack the healers here since she doesnt fit through the doors and AE attacks are line of sight.  I could be somewhat wrong in this, but the general point will remain, Vox cannot fully attack the healers and just because she can summon them (I dont believe she or Naggy do summon, never have been summoned myself, but since they're above 51 I allow the possibility) doesnt mean its not an exploit.  This means we will have to rethink stratagy or risk being warned and or banned or suspended.<br>
<br>
I do urge everyone to read that and its sister thread mainly to get a glimpse as to Verant's train of thought here.  Since right or wrong, they do set the rules and we need to adjust accordingly if we want to keep playing.<br>
<br>
This also brings up another point.  I've had reservations in the past about having support teams above the 53 limit on the dragon raids.  I think its clear that since the object of the level caps on the dragons is to keep these players from participating in the dragon raids, the use of them for any thing would be considered an exploit.  While using them to help clear/buff does seem to be a gray area, I for one would choose not to chance it.  And as for potentially using them to heal during battles and gate back, that is without a doubt an exploit.  <br>
<br>
From where I stand it looks like Verant is putting the player base on notice that action can and will be taken without warning on things they consider to be bannable.  And whether or not you knew what you did was an exploit does not seem to weigh very much.  At best it will get you 1 warning or a suspension rather than an outright ban.  I urge all guilds to seriously take a look at their tactics both in small groups and any raids you may run and see if there's anything that can be remotely considered an exploit and not do it.  While the complete disbanding of a guild seems like an extreme punishment for what appears to be an exteme event, I dont think you can rule it out as a regular punishment in the future.<br>
<br>

<br>
As soon as I get my 4th ot 5th Complete Heal off I get to see the underbelly of Vox or Naggy up close and personal, then I get to see the messages in my sig file. It's kindda fun to look up and see 20+ tanks standing around you wailing furiously, fishing for weak spots in the dragon's hyde.<br>
<br>
All I can say is thank gawd there's no friendly fire in EverQuest.<br>
<br>
While I'm not a die hard player, I will say this, given that Vox's AE Fear reaches all the way back to the king area, it'd be my guess that if I was Healing someone who was fighting Vox, ANYWHERE in the zone that I was still vulnerable to the ole girl. I'm sure some of the more experienced members might debunc this thought, so cool, but just from what I've seen, I don't think how we are fighting is considered a &quot;sploit&quot; (leet speak there).<br>
<br>
Look at it this way, When you are on the battle field, do you put your M.A.S.H. unit in front of or behind the fighters? To me our tactic seems alright, but I'm glad someone is double-checking in light of the Conquest guys. Also keep in mind that Conquest was using other Sploits I guess.<br>

Verant acknowledges that people can be summoned every 18 seconds.  But that is a long time for Vox to be beat on without being able to hit back.  Verant's stance is that this is an exploit.<br>
<br>
Although I feel what we are doing is logically and logistically correct, we need to be careful.  Verant is cracking down on a lot of stuff (notice the latest news about banning accounts that have been &quot;hacked&quot;, no questions asked).<br>
<br>
When I read that whole thread on the official EQ board, I thought about what we were doing.  Perhaps we could move the healers up to the lair.  Would provide for quicker heals for the tanks, who would not have to leave the fight at all, and protect us from any gung-ho GMs. <p><hr>

And there she was through the rock, down the first corrider and coming down the ramp, and further down the ramp and further.  Now how she ended up back in her lair, you will have to ask someone else.

<br>
You don't sit a doctor in the front part of the trenches, and healers have been for centuries considered non-combatants. Hiding the healers from the big mob means that they don't always get attacked the minute they heal someone. <br>
<br>
Vox can and will climb through the wall and get stuck in the wall in an attempt to kill the healers. On the last dragon raid SB did, just this past weekend, Vox reached through a wall and I personally saw the &quot;Azuriem (a cleric in the triage line) has been slain.&quot; message. I have seen Vox run as far as halfway to the gate room down the buff hall, despite the fact that Vox is NOT big enough to even fit through the itty bitty door to her lair (explain that one as not cheating). Vox can and will gate back to her lair when she's at a certain percentage of health, and if there isn't someone there bashing her, she'll complete heal. Nagafen will also reach through walls to kill healers, that's why you make sure not to fight him on the bridge. How about Vox getting stuck in the walls where you can't hit her, but her AE weapon AND her melee attacks can clock people left and right? This was the main reason the Vox rotation moved so fast on Karana, she kept getting stuck in walls. Ever since they upped the aggo on healing, Vox has repeatedly moved into the walls to get at the healers and succeeded. <br>
<br>
This is complete crap. It's no more an exploit than using Rune V and controlling aggro on Venril Sathir. Verant has stacked the deck against us in most of the high level encounters, and telling us they'll ban us for perfectly reasonable tactics is utter hogwash. <br>

<br>
After watching the posts about the Sleepers incident and reading a quote from one of the emails here I am  a) concerned since I am the leader of the dragon raids for the CoG (Council of Guilds) on Karana Server and  b) curious as to some other places I’d like clarification on.<br>
<br>
Obviously being the leader of our Vox and Nagafen raids I am greatly concerned as to what is considered a safe point and what is exploitation. Outside Vox’s lair is not a safe point. On April 8th of this year under Haemish’s leadership with Sacred Band Alliance Vox was taken out. She had become stuck at the door and as soon as she went into run mode she went through the rock door, down the ramp and almost around to the gate room before gating back to her lair. Please check your logs for confirmation of this. I believe it proves that the halls are FAR from safe. Hence having a triage line out there is completely feasible. <br>
<br>
For Nagafen you stated you are concerned that he cannot do the full damage of his potential (example :cant use AE’s) on anyone on the staircase. Again not true. If he is on the bridge and that door is open (which usually it is) he has full use of his breath weapon all the way down the stairs. I’m expecting to be hosting a Nagafen raid very soon if you wish to tag along and check it out I’d be more than happy to show you our tactics and see if the clerics are nailed.<br>
<br>
That being all said I have a few other scenarios to present to you, which relate more closely to the Conquest Guild.<br>
<br>
Most of the points of contention dealt with the exploitation of specific things within the game. Those being (I believe) pathing, and improper use of buffs to negate effects. Here are a few examples I can remember since I was about lvl 5 hunting in CB that I know are used on a day to day basis. Some of these I admit have been used by me, others are too far beyond me to accomplish right now and I only know of by hearing others talk about it.<br>
<br>
In CrushBone : There is a dead spot where nothing can attack or even register your existence. Upon entering you go left across the bridge and back to the right. Instead of going left again to go up the mini ramp down to the Slaver mines, go straight instead. There is a little ledge there right over the water were nothing can attack you, even if you already have agro. Problem? Pathing.<br>
<br>
In CrushBone : A common method for casters to kill Dvinn is – pull him to the front near the jump to trainer hill. Jump onto the ledge, blast, when he gets to you, jump down, blast. And so on until he’s either dead or you run out of Stamina. Problem? Pathing.<br>
<br>
In Kurn’s Tower : Right inside the entrance there is a horrible pathing error. If you stand on one set of tiles the creature comes to you, if you need to heal or anything, simply step one set of tiles to either side. The mob will walk out, around the pillars, along the outside wall and then back down the row of tiles to you. Same by stepping back to the original tiles. Problem? Pathing.<br>
<br>
In The Overthere : Everyone knows about the Fear wall. One of my guildmates (a druid) who was way too low lvl for the zone and was passing through, was attacked by a cactus, feared it (unknowingly right into the wall) and headed into SkyFire to clear agro. He was suspended for trying to run from a mob and had no clue what the wall did. I believe so far it is one of the only publicly known suspension points. So if it’s a simple pathing problem why not change the pathing there? Problem? Pathing.<br>
<br>
In Karnors : A very common tactic with Venril Sathir (from what I hear) is to have one tank pretty much solo him with a couple enches chain casting Rune onto him. Since Rune has no technical life of its own, VS has nothing to drain and therefore can’t heal himself. Is this considered a buff exploit? If so then it should be no problem to convert it so that Rune actually does give life. Problem? Buff Missuse.<br>
<br>
In Cobolt Scar: I’ve often heard from a very good friend about their tactic with Lodizal (the big turtle). They say he can easily be killed with 1 group of lvl 58 – 60’s. How you ask? Easy, since he and the otters are natural enemies, train him onto them, he will eventually kill them all but with about 10% life left, at that point he’s easy pickings. Solution? Make it so he and the otters aren’t natural enemies. Problem? Game Exploitation.<br>
<br>
And lastly I have to ask about this one.<br>
<br>
&quot;8.5.4.2 The key to determining whether a person is exploiting is not in the activity, but is the intent. A player that is using a rain spell to kill masses of monsters may not know it's an exploit, but instead believe that this is simply the function of the spell. It is the responsibility of the Guide to educate the player and ensure that the intention to exploit is present.&quot;<br>
<br>
That can’t be serious. If an AE spell was NOT designed to hit multiple targets then why was it created so it could? If this is an exploit then you need to go around and find every Druid that ever multi kited and ban them too. I don’t use any of my AE spells ever since they’re a waste of time in my eyes as a mage and so I don’t bother but to other classes it’s a much used tool. Besides, if it was not designed around hitting multiple targets why is there more than one chain of AE’s? There’s the rain spells (hitting multiple mobs multiple times with 1 cast) as well as the AE DD’s. To claim that this is not the purpose of the spell is contradictory to its creation and frankly is laughable. Without changing the spell, no one is going to stop using it on multiple mobs.<br>
<br>
Whether Conquest Guild was right or wrong is not in question right now. What I am trying to convey is that there are thousands of people in EQ every day that have been using game errors to play, and its those same game errors that kill us a lot of the time too. All they were doing is continuing what they always did and tried to find a way to do it later on. I agree that having only 30 people do it is kinda cheap since with us we take about 50 – 60 in normally on Vox/Naggy and still fail but, if they received no warning over it and were just told “nope, you’re not playing the way we want you to, bye” and banned them.. well then maybe EQ isn’t worth the 10 bucks Canadian I pay to play it. I don’t feed pockets till I have a 60th lvl char to make 1 mistake and get booted. I run my raids my way, which is the way its been done for 2 years now. Until I get an honest warning I will continue to run them that way. The least that can be done is to have their guild reinstated.

The 2 will fight, then you take the winner.  They are natural enemies.  Problem?  I don't think so.  More realistic of monsters are enemies of each other and not just the player.  And finding an occurance of this is not easy, but I supposed you could do it like Lodizal.<br>

Sorry, that is all I could come up with.  Otherwise, I think you wrote a very good letter. <p><hr>

It was simply to make everyone aware of 1) Verants current stance on this.  2) That Verant seems to believe it is an exploit if the mob cannot fully attack.  It must be able to perform all its attacks on all of the people attacking it.  If it is unable to, for any reason, perform all its attacks, whether it be magical, physical, or summoning, it is an exploit.  3) Verant's policy has been to be warn/soulmark/suspend/ban first, investigate later.  4) It is up to the players to prove somehow they were not exploiting.  5) That ignorance or innocence of knowing what you were doing is an exploit is not an excuse.<br>
<br>
In the past I have noticed that using anything other method other than the hardest and costliest available generally involves one or more things they consider exploits.  Also, that just because its how everyone does it is not going to stop them from making an example of a guild or alliance.  <br>
<br>
Now as for the specific of Vox.  I bring that up since Verant has called it an exploit.  Personally I dont think it matters much if it is or not.  Since we as the players will need to prove that it was not an exploit.  Very difficult to do.  Now as I said before I'm not bringing this up for debate really.  I dont see how it matters if we believe we are right or not.  Verant has stated keeping the healers back outside of the lair or by the bridge for naggy are exploits.  Until they retract this statement and say they were wrong, I think we need to assume that they will warn/ban us if they decide to make an example.  BS or not Verant has shown its willingness to make examples and enforce its policies whenever they see if.  I for one do not wish to be such an example.<br>

<br>
Oh heck with it.<br>
<br>
I could probably name any number of pathing problems beyond what you mentioned Lag.  However, it has been Verant's policy that anytime anyone takes advantage of a pathing error it IS an exploit.  No if, and's, or buts.  Which was why your guildmember was warned.  It does not seem to matter if the person was aware of the problem or not, they are warned and or suspended if there were multiple such warnings in the past.  The reason traditionally has been that the GM's cannot know if the person is aware of what they're doing is a violation or not.  And so they simply assume that everyone who does any violation is automatically guilty.  Now I grant that its rather hypocritical to punish players for bugs in their game and even more so since it's enforcement does seem to be rather spotty.  But right or wrong thats how it is.  Nothing is perfect.  I would also point out that it was the few players who habitually took advantage of pathing errors to advance within the game that forced Verant to take this policy.  I dont particularly care who's right and wrong in this.  It really does not seem very important.  The important part is making absolutely sure we're doing it cleaner and better than everyone else.<br>

Heck, take a look at the new policy about &quot;hacked&quot; accounts.  They are banning the account no matter what.  &quot;You want to complain about your account being hacked?  Sure thing.  Your account has now been banned.  Bye bye.&quot;<br>

<br>
It's a valid tactic and until a GM does something to me, I won't change the way I kill Vox. Next thing they'll tell me is rooting and blasting isn't a valid tactic. Or camping to clear aggro. Or fighting with a weapon. <br>

<br>
And point blank AoE spells..... Just how are they supposed to be used? /shrug  Next thing you know DoTs will be taken out, and then snare and root, then..... then we have no casters anymore. <p><hr>

<br>
1) I dont actually think you can kill a mob using a rain spell.  There's some code involved that even if a mob is at 1hps, you cant kill it with a rain spell.  Now an AE DD spell is different.  But Verant is on record as saying they are against quad kiting so I expect this will land in the exploit pile soon.  And you thought druids were useless in a group?  Soon they'll be useless to solo too.  Oh wait...<br>
<br>
2) How did a druid manage to fear a cactus in OT?  Last I checked druids can only fear animals.  They can charm plants, but thats an obscure enough level 29 quested spell.  Bleh.  I think you meant he feared a sabertooth cat Lag.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3) I think I remember hearing something about Verant considering using Rune as a heal spell to be an exploit.  Something about that not being what it the spell was intended for.  Something along the lines of CHeal never being thought of as a combat spell.<br>
<br>
I think I'm begining to agree with the other druids out there that the game really is PvV.  Forget this PvP and PvE crap, I think the new server should be a Player vs. Verant server.  At least then they'd be honest about it all.<br>
<br>
I also found this link on the druid board.  <br>
<br>
www.cslogos.com/jeff/banned.cfm.<br>
<br>
I really dont know whats sadder.  That someone could do something like this just to get banned, or that I actually found it funny in my present state of mind.  Although, honestly the really sad thing is that it took him something like 2 hours to get banned for multiple confessed deliberate trainings as well as swearing and other offenses.  And yet you can get banned for killing a mob in about 25 seconds if a GM feels like they want to.<br>
<br>
Now I'd like to say I'm going to keep going and do things the way I have been till I get warned.  But in my experience moral victories are simply not worth it in an online game.  So I'm just going to switch some of my stratagies and not attend raids that do anything that can be considered an exploit.  You'll probably find me spending all my time sitting in EC since I'm sure ports will be considered exploits soon too.  Perhaps if I try to stay a good boy they'll actually use some vasaline when it's my time for the big send off.<br>

It seems their bottom line to any questions about exploiting bugs or questionable tactics is that &quot;they cheapen or hurt the game for all the other players.&quot; <br>
Well I personally don't care whether some player or guild happened upon a strategy or bug and exploited it until Verant fixed the problem. I wonder if Verant puts the same question to all the players (maybe a poll of sorts) what kind of response they would get from the player base as to whether they think it cheapens the game for them if somone exploits these bugs??? I would really like to know the answer to that one. It would certainly prove or disprove their assumptions about this aspect of the game.<br>
