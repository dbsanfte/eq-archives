She thought this would be a great way for him to really learn about a potential career in web design etc.<br>
<br>
The son is in trouble with his school (when I say trouble, I mean that they called him in, with his mother, and a sherif's deputy to the principal's office and scared the hell out of the mom) because a student poster to the forum section of his website posted a rant hating a teacher and in that rant said &quot;this instructor needs to be shot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Somehow the school nazi's got wind of this and have launch a witch hunt on this kid, demanding he give the names of all the posters on the site etc.<br>
<br>
The kid not only doesn't want to, but he can't because he only knows the screen name of the individual, and an e-mail name.<br>
<br>
The mom is wondering what are her, and her son's rights (free speech), and the risks if the son refuses to cooperate with the school and hand over the info.  The principal went so far as to say that &quot;Under Bush's Patriot Act, we have the right to do anything we want to get the information.&quot;  Last time I checked, only the federal government and it's designees (police, CIA, FBI etc) could claim this power.<br>
<br>
Now while the student was venting obvious angst, rancor and hate for this instructor, nowhere did it suggest a plan or plot to do anything more than vent.<br>
<br>
We live in &quot;Columbine Country&quot; and these local school officials are even more nazi-like than I've ever seen anywhere ever before.  <br>
<br>
So I'm wondering, as a forum admin, what are your rights/protections for free speech, and besides locking or deleting threads, what is the admins responsibility for posts made and can they be held liable for holding poster's identities (email addresses, IPs etc).<br>
<br>
I advised my friend to talk to the ACLU and a lawyer.  But she's scared and also feels she and her son's rights are being abused because school officials are paranoid about the whole Columbine fiasco, which still isn't over (the investigation into why the students went postal, how long they were planning it, and who knew about it and didn't step in to try to stop it, is still ongoing). <p>Salura Ater'Mors<br>

<br>
False. That message, most likely but I don't know for sure, was about a teacher and had nothing to do with national security. The patriot act would have nothing to do with it or else the FBI would already be there (they move very fast). So the guy is just talking out of his ass trying to strong arm.<br>
<br>

<br>
He would have to cooperate with the demands if a court orders it, but all he could do is turn over the IP address and a username, even if he thought he knew the real name it would not be valid since the mods can't see information about a poster that the poster does not provide during sign up for a user name, and that information can be faked ie; email addresses and real names can be faked very easy. So an IP address is all he would have to supply. I personally would not wait for the court order. He should just do it and avoid all the pain because he has no leg to stand on as far as privacy and free speech since it is most likely a public board and free speech does not cover death threats to my knowledge, even if the kid and parents think the teacher is a nazi. The law takes those things very very seriously now, and with good reason. He should NOT be required to fork over the information on any other user. I believe that the only thing they can be responsible for is withholding evidence or something along those lines if a law was broken. I am not even sure if it is a crime or just a &quot;policy&quot; when it comes to something like this, but just out of civil responsibility I would do what I could.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now while the student was venting obvious angst, rancor and hate for this instructor, nowhere did it suggest a plan or plot to do anything more than vent.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Doesn't matter, they have to take every death threat, however mundane, serious now days. Hundreds of dead teachers/students and dozens of student rampages over the last few decades are to blame for that. People seem to forget that Columbine is not the only time a student has done that. There were at least 6 other times that same year that students killed people at school. Every year hundreds more teachers are beat or just constantly terrorized by students. So it is not paranoia it is reality.<br>
<br>
Getting the ACLU involved is just going to make the parent and kids life that much more difficult in the community. Without seeing the body of the post I can't say if it was a blatant threat or just rambling. If it was a blatant threat it sickens me that anyone could even think that it is within their freedom of speech to keep that information from the authorities. Remember those &quot;school nazi's&quot; are products of the child rearing that has gone on in the last 20 years, not some right wing conspiracy. <br>
<br>
Here are Ezboard's rules.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I. PERSONAL ABUSE<br>
Definition: Uploading, posting, emailing or otherwise transmitting any Content that is threatening, abusive, tortious, defamatory, or libelous.<br>
<br>
ezboard is one of the world's largest online message board services, and it should come as no surprise that users occasionally post materials to a board that someone may find objectionable. Unfortunately, ezboard cannot evaluate the propriety of the hundreds of thousands of new posts made on its service each day. For example, we are simply not in any position to evaluate an allegation that a particular post is defamatory. <br>
<br>
It is for this reason that under United States federal law (47 U.S.C. §230), service providers like ezboard are not liable for content posted to their services by third parties. Accordingly, ezboard will not, as a matter of practice, remove postings based on allegations of abuse without legal process that ezboard reasonably believes compels a response. By contrast, where a party presents a court order establishing that particular content is abusive and should be removed, ezboard will respond as it believes appropriate. We will also respond appropriately to intellectual property claims, and may remove any post as we see fit, in accordance with our Terms of Use. <br>
<br>
To be clear, ezboard does not condone abusive conduct on its service. We cannot, however, censor legitimate content based on the mere allegation that it is abusive. <br>
<br>
Complaint Procedure: All requests or information related to subpoenas and court orders in conjunction with abuse should be directed to Steven DeMello, President and COO, at sdemello@ezboard.com<br>
<br>
II. SUBPOENA/COURT ORDER<br>
Definition: Any legal process that ezboard reasonably believes compels a response.<br>
<br>
Complaint Procedure: All requests or information related to subpoenas and court orders should be directed to Steven DeMello, President and COO, at sdemello@ezboard.com<br>
<br>
III. POSTING OF ILLEGAL MATERIAL<br>
Definition: Posting or otherwise causing to appear, or linking to, on any ezboard, any material ezboard reasonably believes to constitute or solicit illegal activity, including but not limited to: child-pornography; animal-related (&quot;farm sex&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  pornography; and posting of materials soliciting involvement in illegal business schemes (also known as &quot;scam spam&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Complaint Procedure:<br>
<br>
Fill out and send a Legal Issue Request Form <br>
Select &quot;Posting of Illegal Material&quot; under &quot;Specify Your Issue&quot; <br>
In the description, include URL's that contain the specific posts that you believe are in violation; where appropriate, provide a description of the posts, including type of illegal material, the poster's name, and a description of contents <br>
<br>
<br>
IX. VIOLATIONS OF PRIVACY<br>
Only the individual whose information is posted may submit a valid complaint of this type.<br>
<br>
Definition: Posting or otherwise causing to appear on an ezboard any of the following, without the permission of the subject(s):<br>
<br>
Full name <br>
Residential or business address <br>
Phone number <br>
Social Security number <br>
Credit card number <br>
E-mail address <br>
Pictures of subject or subject's family/friends/pets/place of residence or employment/study <br>

<br>
Complaint Procedure:<br>
<br>
Fill out and send a Legal Issue Request Form <br>
Select &quot;Violations of Privacy&quot; under &quot;Specify Your Issue&quot; <br>
In the description, include URL's that contain the specific posts that you believe are in violation; where appropriate, provide a description of the posts, including user name and a description of contents. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I searched for a good long time and could find nothing on message board privacy rights and the law. But if he had sent that posting via email or snail mail to a newspaper he would be under psychiatric observation already and the paper would be required to give over all the information about it. <br>
<br>

The police are the proper ones to deal with, particularly the officer who was present at the time of the initial meeting.<br>
<br>
Your friend does have a legal responsibility, if court-ordered, to disclose any and all information requested.  However, if she waits for a court order, she is liable to find herself in tighter quarters than she is now.<br>
<br>
This is going to be a hard lesson for your friend's son with regards to reality and paranoia.  I'm not saying I condone threats.  I'm saying our children need an outlet for the feelings.  Some kids use a diary, others use a blog.  A message board was an inappropriate choice, on the offender's part anyway.<br>
<br>
IMNSHO, the school official is trying to bully your friend and push his own limited weight around.  I have a low opinion of principals and school nurses, anyway.  <br>
<br>
I hope your friend and her son get through this, with minimal trouble.  Working with the police, it'll pass faster.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>IMNSHO, the school official is trying to bully your friend and push his own limited weight around. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First off NO threat was made against the teacher if you stated correctly that all the student said was.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;this instructor needs to be shot.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Did the student say he was going to shoot someone? No. Did he say he was going to pay someone to do it? No. There is actually no case against this student because he never made a threat against anyone, but just stated an opinion. <br>
<br>
Second off the principle in this case has NO authority or rights, PERIOD. He is a school admin and has nothing to do with the law or anything to do with the case, should the Sheriff's office decide to pursue it. Personally if a person came across this way to me I would have said thank you, go away and come back with a court order because he was trying to abuse his power. No judge in this case would issue that court order because there is no case against the person.<br>
<br>
It is not cooperation with the school that is needed and I would advise the parent and child to ONLY deal with the Sheriff's department. Once you let the school think they have power in this case you will loose all your rights and set precedence in this case to have the principle request information every time he wanted it. Next thing you know the child is going to be bombarded with request for every single person's information on that board that says anything the principle might not like. I would suggest the parent and child meet with the Sheriff's department without the principle there because he has no right to be at a meeting where the Sheriff's department is questioning a subject or conducting an investigation. <br>
<br>

First, the principle has no right making any threats of any kind to the kid about that post.  Legally he cannot force the kid or his mother to give that information to him.  <br>
All the Kid or moderator of a board has to do in order to avoid any legal action is to delete that post.<br>
The principle did over step his boundries big time.  I hope the mother has enough sence to get a lawyer. <p>Rathermon Briteblade<br>

<br>
Hell no. <br>
<br>
While he may not have a leg to stand on, (is that a technical term?) under no circumstances should he fork up the goods without a court order. If someone registers anonomously to an EZboard, or to give a clearer example, if I took someone's personal information that I know, for example, Alinor's address, telephone number, and other vital statistics, and volunteered it up to someone without being forced to by the proper legal channels, I'm opening myself up for a civil case, and possibly criminal depending on what the information is used for. If there was any doubt as to the principal's legal right to the demanded information, it could be claimed that, and rightfully so, that in a setting where the privacy of your identity is held by one person or a small group, that there is an expectation of privacy. If the principal, using the information, had tracked the student down and suspended/expelled them for posting their views about a shitty teacher, the expelled student would at least have, if not a winnable argument, at least an interesting, and likely actionable argument for damages. <br>
<br>
If someone has a right to something, make them prove it. If they can't, they obviously didn't have the right to it. <br>
