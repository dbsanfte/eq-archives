I never asked that I was just invited into Gnomish Battalions at about 10 or 11 I think. I had no idea what a guild was for but the guy that invited me made it sound fun.<br>
<br>
Then Disciples of Underfoot was what we made that guild into.<br>
<br>
Now because of good friends I'm a Hero.<br>

Come on Bic tell us a bit about your road from that n00b that wondered why you join a guild to where you are now.<br>

Here's my story:<br>
<br>
Veteran's Legion was the first guild that I ever wanted to join, but I never asked them because I thought I was too low and that since they didn't know me they'd never take me. This was after one of their members named Arimuss led me around Felwithe for 3 hours showing me everything from what a zone was, to where I get my spells, to how to scribe them. He even bought me some food and water. I was like, WOW, this is cool. Are there really more people like that? Cuchulaine may remember my posting about it WAY back in like June of 00. Arimuss was a level 12 wizard at the time, and they gave him a silk robe as a reward for his good deed. I always thought that's the way a guild should be run... but didn't know it then. I considered asking if I could join, but then I remember a post on their website about accepting no more applications at that time... so I was a little depressed and dropped it in my mind... but then again, I never did ask or tell anyone that I was interested. Silly shy wizard...<br>
<br>
A little while after I posted this very post, some Knights of Luclin (or was it Knights of Velious? I think Luclin) approached me about joining. They were two fellas (ranger and druid maybe?) who were about level 14ish and said they were going to be involved in great journeys, and that I should join them... and SMACK!! a guildinvite was on my screen before I could say anything (no, this is not a knock of either guild. This was a beginning time, and ya, we all know how those times can be). So I said I'd have to think about it and they promptly left.<br>
<br>
So I wandered around and about a week later ended up joining a guild with a female cleric that was always on when I was. Her name was Meiah who had an RL relation to the guildleader Scoron (now in Veil of Shadows). That guild was called Elements of Power. I joined when I was 10 I guess, and I had fun with a crazy paladin named Falamin and another named Funji. The two paladins, Meiah, and I would WRECK crushbone and other places we'd travel to.<br>
<br>
I stayed in Elements of Power because I knew nothing else (other than VL) all the way until it was deleted by Scoron on 7/22/01 for reasons I don't want to go into in this post, but let's say I've forgiven all. I was guildless for the first time in over a year... I didn't know what to do. I thought I'd be guildless and was looking for a new one, and recieved several dozen... no wait, that's an underestimate, but anyway, several dozen guild offers all of which I have sitting on a piece of paper in my right middle drawer, folded in half and sitting toward the back of it, because I thought I'd have to find a place where I'd fit in an be useful all over again. Then Yanun took the bull by the horns and like a super sayan from Dragonball Z got back up and powered us up... although we'd lost all but one of our 50+ members (like 8 went to VoS) we got our lower people to rally and had 12 people online to sign the petition to create NEW Elements of Power... when we'd rarely had even 10 people online at once... ever. I'd not openned that paper with the guilds who offered me a home again until just now, when I remembered it. I'm glad I got my home back...<br>
<br>
and we had a 13th person there too, to sign the petition to create New Elements of Power. That person was the guildleader of Veterans Legion... Sierraa. Funny... It began with Veterans Legion for me... twice. This is why I say that Veterans Legion is my second home. I would have been my first home had I had the guts to ask about joining, maybe. One of them asked me once why I feel so committed to Veterans Legion, and why I've started saying it's my second home. Well, that's exactly why.<br>
<br>
There are many good guilds out there... and even more good people. But for me, New Elements of Power is my home. Good aspiring people who care not of the endgame, it's not their goal. There are people I can help there, unlike in other guilds. And there are people I've known since square one... like Yanun, Ealdayen, Drakular (aka. Darkangel or Savinju), Tilian, and more... and now I have more great friends there, like Fandiien, Yasai, Solonn, Arquen, and I'm going to intentionally cut that list short and leave people out, because I don't want to leave one or two people out... I'd rather leave a whole bunch out who know that although I didn't meantion them, I'm talking to them. And recently we've gotten some bright new faces from the guild Lux Baiulus who merged into us, and other people like Ottoe, Tedy, Hogsnot, Malaguena, and more. They're a fantastic bunch, with playing times spread far and wide, but who cares? WE HAVE FUN. We've seen people leave to go to VoS, LoS, CoJ, you name it. And we've had good fun wholehearted honest people retire, go into hiding in alternate characters in other guilds for RL reasons, or just disappear entirely... as all guilds do.<br>

Wow i am very impressed and i can relate to things that happened to me when i was a noobie <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The first Guild i joined is the same guild i am in now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , it started with my 3rd character a now (*cough, still) 19 druid: sangohan, i was in ec and someone shouted that Disciples of Underfoot were recruiting, knowing the guild was for shorties only, i joined <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . The guild then had like 15ish members or so, it just started. Since then it has changed leadership 3 times, got a million more members (JK <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), leveled up to a guild mostly 35-56, and changed websites 3 times too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , currently we have around 25 ACTIVE members (who play once a week, maybe more &lt;--live in CET, so i don't get to see everyone).<br>
<br>
I have seen lotsa good people go and come, some of the orginal members are still playin, but only a few are still active with that character, i do see alts of them and still have fairly good connections with them.<br>
<br>
Just a big hug to all the ex-dou'ers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , specially sjoc, ntro and xabbo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><font color=dark green><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15523>Sheane Arrowless</a>, 46th Arrow Slinger, Luclin</font><br><font color=Silver><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6463>Shaulonfist</a>, 19th Tranquil One, Luclin</font> <br><p>

RE: Sjoc, <br>
Yeah, I can remember the day I completed the staff of the wheel wizard quest (with a bunch of help from friends)  I was flipping head over heals with excitement when Irio helped me to go get the last piece of it.  OMG I thought a 10int item was the end all be all of Uber Wizzy gear!!! (Who cares if you could only swing the darn thing once a decade in melee'ing! heh)<br>
