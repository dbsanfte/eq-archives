<br>
to all you lowbies who can't understand why us druids ask for SOOOO much money for teleports let me fill u in on something i had to repeat throughout the entire zone of BBM multiple times when i was camping dwarves there for 14 levels.<br>
<br>
well start out with a bit of role-playing<br>
<br>
Lowbie - &quot;can u port me, kind sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
Me - &quot;I'm kind of busy leveling on these exciting dwarves, but i suppose i can TP you for 30pp minimum&quot;<br>
<br>
Lowbie - &quot;WTF?  30pp for a port?  i only have 8 silver!  you are a selfish bastard, ill just take advantage of this level 29 who just got his TP spells, he'll port me for for &quot;donations&quot; he he.  i know that you can port me with hardly any cost to you at all.  yo uare just lazy.  and u know what makes me more of a dumbass?  im in a zone with a boat that goes straight to mydestination.&quot;<br>
<br>
Me - &quot;OK let me throw a few figures at you.  at level 40 i am averaging approximately 15pp on loot every 10 minutes.  i am also averaging about one orange bubble of experience every 30-40 minutes.  ok it takes me almost two bubbles of my mana to port you.  a little bit more for a sow and then more to port myself back and hope my camp isnt taken.  in the amount of time it takes me to do all this.  adding al lthis up it costs me about 20pp in loot and least a quarter bub of experience to port your sorry ass because you are too lazy to take the dam boat.  the other druid who is taking &quot;donatoins&quot; for TPs, just got his spells and thinks he is making great money using it. at level 29 the loot he usually makes is not much compared to the donatoins he receives for a port.  at least this is true until he sits down and realizes he is losing money and exp in the time it takes him to med his mana back up.<br>
<br>
Lowbie - &quot;you druid are rich bastards&quot;<br>
<br>
Me - &quot;This is a common lament among EQ players, that druids are rich.  for the most part we are not.  TPing doesnt bring in much cash and we certainly do not do it all the time.  druids are the best soloers at highers levels (just my opinion) when everything resists necro spellsbut nothing we solo loots crap.  we cant find a group in any dungeon and get good items which are the REAL money makers.  this is because 1) too many druids, 2)we dont have much to offer groups but backup heals and dmg shields...snare in some cases, and 3) we have soloed our whole lives and dont know anyone in a group to get us in.  we also dont know HOW to group =).&quot;<br>
<br>
sorry im getting off the subject.  people above level 40 seem to understand this, its all the lowbies who pester me when i pss thru a newbie zone.  and i like my anon off. =(<br>
<br>
P.S. At level 52 ports hardly cost any mana...almost one bub...i pretty much give way ports for free now but accept donations.  its just a matter of whether im busy or not.  most people understand this.  </font><P><img src="http://theastralfate.tripod.com/Image4.jpg"><br>

Then they say...&quot;oh wait, my friend needs a ride too&quot; In the end, they hand you over 8pp and some gold or sometimes, nothing...forgetting to say thank you. <br>
 <br>
In the meantime, three people from the Pig family (you see them everywhere *sigh*) take over your dwarf camp and say they will be there for the next &quot;several hours&quot;. So you ask the guild if they need a druid for anything, and they answer, &quot;Well hell yea, I neeeeed you *wink*&quot;  *sigh*  <br>
<br>
hehe...well that's how it was for my druid...Best of luck Daedelous and hope you find some understanding customers.<br>

I don't respond to /ooc for ports when I am xping and I always go /role. I alternate between there and HG's in Rathe Mountains depending on which is camped. I make crappy money but good xp off the Spec and somewhat good xp but great money of HG's. Breaking a camp to do a port can cost me dearly, especially at the Spectre as he is usually camped 24-7. I never ask a specific amount for a port though. If I am free and not doing anything in paticular I will port you and when you ask how much I always respond with &quot;whatever&quot;. This reply has brought me anywhere from 10pp to 100pp depending on the player. All my ports come with a SOW and a Lev/Camo depending on where we are porting to. <br>
<br>
I have gone out of my way on occasion to help lowbies that lost a corpse on the other side of the world or are trying to get from Qeynos to Freeport at L5 or somthing. I am not a greedy heartless bastard but remember, porting takes away from my time and for me these days time on EQ is precious.</font><P><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=10237">Berton Strongheart</a> 57th Knight<BR><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=41843">Stroh Tanglefoot</a> 37th Druid<BR><a href="http://www.sanct.com">Sanctuary</a><BR>Nameless<BR>"I calculated the odds of this succeeding versus doing something very stupid, and I decided to go ahead anyway."<BR>

It happens every single night.  I am grouped at a camp in my favorite dungeon and get tells, &quot;Can you come to in-zone and summon my corpse.&quot;  My reply, &quot;I don't have any coffins on me sorry.&quot;  You would think that this would be enough of a NO to get the point across, but it doesn't.  &quot;Well if I got you a port to Nek could you get a coffin and then summon me.&quot;  Finally, after enough nagging I have to show the true SK in me and tell to stop freaking bothering me.  If I had a coffin and was not busy, I would summon them for free, as I have many times in the past.  It is as if me being a Shadow Knight is to only serve them when they are in trouble and have lost their bodies.  I also get asked to locate corpses a lot as well.  Usually, though newbies don't know that SK's have this spell very early on in the game, so they tend to harass Necros more.<br>
<br>
If I am not grouped or on a quest or heading some where in a hurry I am more than willing to use a little mana to find or summon someone's corpse.  However, summoning will cost you the price of the coffin.<br>
<br>
The unfortunate thing regarding Druids is they have gotten a rather bad reputation undeservingly.  How many times have you heard the &quot;farming Druid&quot; joke?  Let's be honest Druid's aren't exactly the hardest to play in Everquest, hence you see exponentially more Druids than any other class, So I agree the server is saturated with them.  Not to mention a lot of people have had bad expericances with them.  While in Timors Deep fighting Spirocs (great exp at level 4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I would see a few greedy druids kiting 4 and 5 birds.  Not having a single concern with the fact that there were several other people at the city also wanting a bird or two for themselves.  How many of you Wood Elf Warriors have been asked for a SoW or a TP?  Just goes to show that the population of Druid class on The Nameless is a bit exceeding.<br>
<br>
Personally, with the exception of the boneheads in TD I have never had a problem with a Druid.  When I ask for a tp it is always in /ooc form and I wait for someone to /tell me.  And, when I do get the port I always pay according to the destination.  Say I get ported from EC to the DL and then evacted to EJ.  I usually fork over a 100 plat or so.  A lot of the times the person porting me about faints when I toss the 100 plat in the trade window.  I guess most people are to cheap to pay for the services that had just saved them about 2 hours worth of travel time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I agree for the most part and I can understand the frustration of being a class that can be of some use to others.  Granted I don't get asked to locate or summon someone’s corpse as you do for a sow and tp, but nonetheless I can see your point.<br>
<br>
Although, I do disagree on one point.  I think Necro's are still king of the solo.  I just don't see how a Druid can out solo a Necro...  IMO<br>

Something like this...<br>
<br>
<br>
/afk I'm not porting right now, foff<br>
<br>
or if they just hanging and don't like being bothered but wouldn't mind extra cash..<br>

I have learned that it is absolutely pointless to argue with folks (unless you are bored and want some fun) so I've become so quick with the ignore key that it's not even funny.<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
Now some tips for folks that want a port and are willing to pay.<br>
<br>
1. Get to a zone with a druid or wiz platform. Do not expect folks to pick you up in some way out zone.<br>
<br>
2. /shout Buying port to X paying 30pp (or whatever)<br>
<br>
3. If you get no response do /who all dru 30 44 or wiz and look for folks that are IN zones with rings or platforms. If they are you'll have a better chance of finding someone out to make some cash.<br>
<br>
4. Send em a SHORT tell with &quot;You porting for cash man?&quot; If they say no respond with &quot;thanks much&quot; if they don't respond move on to the next one.<br>
<br>
5. Once you find someone make SURE you are at the druid ring or wiz plat waiting for them, don't go afk, don't go to eat, don't go to whack off just wait. <br>
<br>
When they show up make sure they know your destination. Do NOT say &quot;wait for my buddy&quot; or &quot;1 minute while I make this trade&quot; or anything just GO.<br>
<br>
6. Pay them give a short thanks and move along.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#989dca><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uixnay1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ixnay1</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#333333>3/19/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#333333>4:43:02 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Druid Port PP Charging Explained</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial"><br>

If you need a res AND are willing to pay etc.<br>
<br>
First lets list what not to expect:<br>
<br>
1. Do NOT expect ANYONE to answer you if you are in a zone shouting &quot;Need a res at Karnors!&quot;. I always laugh when I see these deluded people that believe folks are just standing around waiting to serve their needs.<br>
<br>
2. Do NOT expect a cleric to come to your body and res you.<br>
<br>
3. Do NOT expect a cleric to drag your corpse to anywhere<br>
<br>
4. Do NOT expect a cleric to res you for free. If you are lucky and get someone to res you that's great but you are infringing on THEIR time and the time of the group they happen to be with so be respectful and thankful.<br>
<br>
5. Do NOT expect a response if you request a res from a cleric you don't know. If they don't answer your tel, don't keep bugging them or they'll never res you again.. forever. <br>
<br>
6. Do NOT expect a res just because you asked for one. If someone says they are busy, respect that, be thankful they responded at all, say thanks and then move on.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok now what to do...<br>
<br>
1. Look for a ressing cleric IN the zone in which you died. <br>
<br>
I hate to say this but if you are dead in a zone with no ressing clerics you are going to have an awful hard time unless you know the person.<br>
<br>
If you happen to be dead in a zone with no cleric but it's along a normal travel path (lets say Kael Drakkal) you MAY get lucky finding a cleric in a zone near by and ask him if he's traveling through the area where you died.<br>
<br>
2. If you find a cleric in the zone you died then contact them with a BRIEF tell. Do NOT give sob stories, do not talk about lost of exp, do NOT whine and do NOT demand. Here let me demonstrate...<br>
<br>
/t (cleric) Hey man would you be able to res me if I drag my corpse to you. I'll pay. No hurry and no problem if you are busy.<br>
<br>
A tell like this, even if it doesn't get you a res, will normally at least get you a response as you are being polite, showing concern for the players time and you are asking (not demanding) and offering to pay.<br>
<br>
3. If the cleric says no, repeat step one and two. If he agrees send ONE more tel like so:<br>
<br>
/t (cleric) Great! Shoot me a loc and I'll get it there asap<br>
<br>
That is ALL the communication that is needed. Do NOT bug the cleric, don't spam him with tels, don't be a dork. YOU are the one requesting the favor and it is YOUR responsibility to get your own corpse there and to cause the SMALLEST disruption possible.<br>
<br>
4. Get your corpse (or have your friend get it) and drag it to the cleric, near by so it's visable but not right in his face. The sit down quietly and be patient. The cleric normally has other things going on and a group he's responsible for and once again it's YOU requesting the favor so STFU and relax.<br>
<br>
5. If you are sitting for 10 mins or more then another brief tel is normally ok. Something like..<br>
<br>
/t (cleric) Corpse is here now. Ready for res whenever, no hurry, thanks very much.<br>
<br>
Then STFU again.<br>
<br>
6. Once you get your res, get your corpse out of the way and loot up.<br>
<br>
7. THANK the cleric briefly but sincerely and pay them. Don't say &quot;how much&quot; or &quot;is this enough&quot; or any of that dumb shit. Drop AT LEAST 100pp right on the cleric's trade window (PLEASE DON'T DO THIS WHEN THE CLERIC'S GROUP IS FIGHTING) and hit trade.<br>
<br>
8. Bow, split and get out of the guy's face.<br>
<br>
Following the above will get your more resses than not and folks will remember you and your courtesy and be more apt to res you next time.<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>

Once you get to know the game all other classes are fun, but you sure do miss the ease of travelling.<br>

Second - If you see a druid or 2 at the Spirocs in TD then don't stop, keep going.  That should be called Druid Tree.  We grab 4 at a time and rest, 4 at a time and rest.  Nice exp.  <br>
<br>
Third - I TP anyone for donations.  From nothing to 100p I don't care.  If you pull me out from an adventure you WILL pay bigtime.  If I just log on or am logging off, I like to help folks out.  If I wasn't a Druid, I'd pay around a plat per level, depending on the amount of time the TP saves me.<br>
<br>
Fourth - Soloing - hmmm who is better Necro or Druid.  How about a Necro turns 49 and a Druid Turns 49 - who do you think will be the first to 52 if both solo.  Hmmmm Maybe the DRUID Fewl - in 1/3  time it takes a Necro - Mwahahaha - taking down an individual mob goes to Necro's though - they are an all around self sufficient class.<br>
<br>
Fifth - I had some idiot tell me for a lift I just logged on so I said sure - where r u?  <br>
  In Freeport.  <br>
Can u run to the druid ring in EC or SRO? <br>
  NO, can u come get me and my friend in Freeport.  <br>
Sorry, no can do, go to a druid ring and ask for a tp.  <br>
  Just come get me and my friend Pleeaasseee.  <br>
Sorry, can't I'm in a group now in SolB now.  <br>
7 tells later he was on my ignore list.  Some folks just don't get it.<br>

Regarding ports... I was really busy the other night had to tp some friends around and transfer an item in FV, I had the person waiting in FV for me and they were going to log soon.  A Pally wanted a tp to WC, must of been my own fault but I didn't mind tping this one guy.  So I tell him well I can tp you but you have to come with me really quick to FV.  He says ok.  So I go to KC waiting for him 10 min pass and he is there, I invite him SoW him and invis him (so use to higher lvls having a form of see invis item)... I say ok let's go.  So off I go and he's not near me.  He says well I don't really know my way to FV very well.  I tell him that I am sorry but if he could wait a few that I could come back and get him and sorry that I cannot &quot;hold his hand&quot; to FV.  I get at least 3 tells ripping me a new one saying what a meanie (in short) that I am and that I was rude.  <br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
He finally said that I was really rude and was mean.<br>
<br>
How was I mean?   I was the one that offered to TP him, and I expect the person to do their best to follow me if I have somewhere to go really quick.<br>
<br>
Regarding TPs in general, I usually get low PP for it, if I tp anyone, just the way I am.  Usually while I am in ec checking out auctions on my druid I don't tp anyone unless their price is 50+pp.. and even if I tp them it is rare.<br>
<br>
Regarding my pricing for TP I do my best to make it over 50pp for 29+ and over 100pp for 50+<br>
