Wasn't really thinking of the movies as you suggested.  I, personally would have tried a more political move and slowly urge/help those who oppose Saddam (say Iran) push him from his throne.  While I understand that there are other consequences associated with this (perhaps the Iran decides to enslave all the Iraqis after it takes down Saddam), I still believe it is a better way to approach this.<br>

After the car bombing incident with the taxi that killed 4 soldiers, there is no way you can justify us not shooting at someone that fails to stop at a check point tho. For all those soldiers know it is another suicide bomber out to kill their men. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I have yet to see iraqi exiles or liberated iraqi's (i limit to these because i think no one will disagree that a person who has a gun to his or his loved ones head is not likely to speak his true opinion) speak out against the US. In fact they are either saying  nothing which may or may not be because they still fear saddam and abandonment by the US as in 1991, or they are thanking us and cheering that we have come to liberate them. Just today a major shiite cleric called for the people to support us, that to me does not sound like they dont want us there. I would like to think that the opinions of the civilians who face the possibility of death for their freedom at the very least give some justification to our cause for being there, and to be quite honest complaining about their situation when they in fact welcome it over saddam shows just how invalid the argument about iraqi civilians is. So if you think we shouldnt be there because of civilians, fly yourself over there and tell them why you think they should continue to be slaughtered by saddam cause you think it is wrong to be there.<br>
<br>
I would also like to add that peace has been givin a chance, 12 years and 17 resolutions worth, saddam has had ample time to disarm peacefully, he has not and Hans Blix said it himself &quot;the only compliance out of iraq was getting the inspectors out&quot;. 1441 authorized use of force if saddam did not comply, there was no partially comply and you are ok BS, saddam was to comply peacefully or not (This is a YES or NO situation, there is no KINDA) and he choose not to, that alone is all the justifaction we need. Furthermore, the job of the inspectors is to make sure saddam is complying not play hide and seek with his weapons so dont say inspections were working and needed more time, because we have givin him plenty of time over and over again. There is no reason he should not have disarmed by now other than he did not intend to.<br>
<br>
Regardless, the war is well underway and it will not be over until saddam has been removed, and we should support our troops, their families, and our President. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xarien>Xarien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/3/03 4:42:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I smell bull$hit</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So if you think we shouldnt be there because of civilians, fly yourself over there and tell them why you think they should continue to be slaughtered by saddam cause you think it is wrong to be there<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
No proof eh? According to the UN you seem to love and trust so much there are 8500 liters of anthrax unaccounted for among other things, not only that, correct me if I am wrong, scuds although not weapons of mass destruction are prohibited by the resolutions, why does he have them if he has been disarming the last 12 years? Also why does he have chem suits and vacines to nuetralize nerve gas, the US does not use such weapons?<br>
<br>
Lastly the US is based on majority rule with minority rights, your rights including expressing your opinion have no been removed and just because you arent getting your way does not mean you are being oppressed, its called democracy, you are outnumbered. Obviously their will never be a decision everyone agrees with, the fair solution is to listen to the majority. Does the majority make it the right thing always?Probably not, although i think this is the right thing to do in this situation. BTW supporting the troops their families and our President is not oppression, i dont know why you even tried to include it.<br>

Why don't we abide by these rules?  Why do we have weapons of mass destruction?  Anyways think about this, what happens to Iraq if they fully disarm.

Ok , there went any Intelligence that I saw ... <br>
<br>
You know at this point in time , the fact that you and others don't support the President is pretty much moot ... <br>
<br>
Its your right to not agree with him ... <br>
<br>

So sending in another government that may or may not be as oppressive and evil to take over a country is more tactful than using our armed forces to insure that Iraq is governed by it's own people and isn't repressed?! No, thanks. Remind me not to take your course in tact if you ever start one.<br>

If that's the case why not just let Saddam stay in power, hell let's buy him a cake too and ask nicely and he might treat them with respect.<br>

Let's assume we don't use Iran and support current Iraqi opposition groups, a civil war would kill as many...if not more civilians than the current coalition force going in and removing Iraq. A war with Iran would cause probably even more.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anyways think about this, what happens to Iraq if they fully disarm. They have plenty of enemies who would love to see that happen.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Well, Iran might attack and take over if Iraq fully disarmed unless someone stepped in....but that's what you want anyway it seems.<br>

<br>
About as funny as when we shoot down banned weapons as they fly towards civilian areas in Kuwait. I guess the missles Iraq is launching towards Kuwait are the coalitions fault too.<br>
<br>
To claim that the coalition forces are causing civilian casualties and increasing the amount of war crimes commited by the current regime against civilians is ignorant at best. The current regime in Iraq would be killing any opposition to them no matter who was leading the war. It has been a stated objective from the outset to keep civilian casualties down as much as possible, that's why the troops use precision guided weapons. If we didn't care about the Iraqi people and just wanted to come and wipe them out it would be quicker, cheaper and less dangerous to American troops, but we are there to stop just such things. The whole thing could of been avoided, but Saddam refused to comply with &quot;diplomatic&quot; solutions. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=315862" target="top">Mongo</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

This is exactly the reason we have problems like we have.  Go back and read how some here blame the US when we do attempt this type of policy.<br>
<br>
The anti-war propaganda blames the US for helping Iraq back when it was fighting Iran because at the time Iran was the enemy and Iraq wasn't.  Now you are suggesting we help Iran to overthrow Iraq because Saddam is the enemy now?<br>
<br>
So let me get this straight.  You are suggesting the US put itself in another no-win situation?<br>
<br>
Just to show you how hypocritical leftists are (and yes I am assuming you are a leftist based on your responses here), the US did what you suggested for 12 years.  Political pressure was used in the sanctions that the UN imposed on Iraq because of their non-compliance with UN resolutions.<br>
<br>
But the leftists blame the US and the UN imposed sanctions for starving millions of Iraqi people.<br>
<br>
Again the US was in a no-win situation.  Leftists don't want a win-win situation which is what this war is really about.  Leftists are screaming that the war is wrong because it will de-stabilize the Middle East and create further anti-US sentiment there.  Of course the last twelve years of doing it the leftist way and seeking political means has made us more respected in the Arab world.  Sure....<br>
<br>
Finally, your comment about Greek media.  Having spent a year in Greece, I am fairly familiar with Greek media.  Greece is littered with communist and socialist parties like the KKE.  Not just small packets of people, these parties are very large and have a strong influence on the Greek media.  Media doesn't want to tell the truth and only the truth, the media appeals to it's audience unless controlled by the government.<br>
<br>
When I watched the Greek news, I saw considerable anti-US propaganda broadcasted and put very little stock into their unbiased reporting.<br>
<br>
You go right ahead and watch Greek media.  I won't and could care less what they have to say. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=140009" target="top">Ozzone - Noble Blade</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
First of all, yes I do try to pay attention to both sides of the arguement which includes watching news from both sides. <br>
<br>
Secondly I said you SEEM to love and trust the UN, I dont recall quoting you as stating you did, but rather implying that I believe you feel that way. So maybe I will just ask you, DO you trust the UN? If you do trust them as what you might see as an alternative why worry about me saying you do? If you dont then you must think everyone is wrong because letting the UN have more time is really the primary solution proposed by the left and anti-war side.<br>
<br>
There are 2 very important reasons why Iraq is not allowed to have these weapons and other nations such as the US are. 1) We are responsible with them, for example we dont use them on our own people, as well as we abide by the Genevia convention. Saddam does use them recklacely and he does not abide by the convention. 2) The world community does not agree we shouldnt have them, as is the case with Iraq. I urge you to show me a country, for the war or not, that thinks Saddam should be allowed to keep his weapons. They may have different thoughts on how to disarm him but even countries such as France agree he should be disarmed.<br>
<br>
How does my description of Democracy not coincide with my previous statement? For one you didnt even manage to find a quote where I asked you to accept anything, but rather (and I think this is the statement your refering to) I stated the fact that the war has started and will not be over until saddam is disarmed. This is a fact and I really can't see how you could interprit this as me telling you what you should believe. Rather it is part of my debate with you which is trying to persuade someone to see something the way you do, or arguing your side. If trying to persuad or &quot;ask for acceptance&quot; if you really want to stretch it that far is oppression than you are quilty as well for debating your side.<br>
That aside, asking someone to do something gives them a choice, if I in some way managed to force you to accept something I might be oppressing you but since you clearly have a choice to believe what you want I am going to have to think you are quite free, and very much not oppressed.<br>
Disclaimer: I dont actually feel oppressed by your right to speak your side, just making a comparisson.<br>
<br>
Lastly, yes, i probably should have limited my request for support to the troops and their families as you have every right not to support our Presidents decisions although I still believe I was not oppressing anyone to do so. As to the troops supporting them, and supporting their mission are really two different things.<br>

No, but perhaps forcing someone (indirectly or not) to support something they don't agree with is where the feeling of oppression entered. ie: If you don't do A, then you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>must</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be doing B. There is no C, only A or B.<br>
