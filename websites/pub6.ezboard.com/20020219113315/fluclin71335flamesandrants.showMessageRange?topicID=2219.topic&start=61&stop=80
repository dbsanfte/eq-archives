Me and Suria both are former guides.  When I get some free time in the navy both of us are going back to our guiding server.  The people that we guide with there are the best biggest family/guild of truly nice people I've ever met...<br>
<br>
Not the backstabbing guild CoS has turned into.  <br>
<br>
Axlin, poppa is very charismatic.  Very willing to pull people in to raise the power of his guild so he might some day get a glimpse of ToV...  but he's still an a$$<br>
<br>
The purpose of my initial post was to make people see what poppa and his guild have turned into.  Some are still nice people, heh you truly dont know who your friends are till you get into it with their guild.<br>
<br>
The fact that Wenile and Venrah have left makes me happy that at least two who have read this thread have realized all the bad stuff in there.... if you dont have anything to do with this, and feel like you should insult me and my wife phainein baselessly, fine.  Flames and rants away =P <br>
 <br>
But this is to the CoS members that dont wanna take it anymore<br>
<br>
And the Uber Guilds to laugh at. <br>
<br>
And poppa to hopefully do some introspection about who he is.<br>
<br>
NOT for the people who just see this as some @#%$ soap opera.  <br>

Yes Iberar, both me and Soreah have literally been to every zone in the game. Guiding takes you there. I've seen Guilds twice the size of LoS on raids. I've seen things you'll never see. I've probably more game experience than Poppa, for all his levels, because I have seen the entire world of Norrath, and had to answer petitions of the most oddest situations imaginable.<br>
<br>
I've also talked to guilds who have the greatest teamwork I've ever seen, and I've gotten to work with the finest people imaginable in working an entire Server.<br>
<br>
So when I see the things Poppa has done, I can look at it from a victim's standpoint, an outsider's standpoint, and even a Guide's standpoint.<br>
<br>
You are right Sejin. Poppa will do anything he can to get himself a little higher. He has hurt a lot of good people doing it. That's why we are posting this. I don't care if it's long, and boring, and annoying to people who don't understand what's going on. The people that do are what is important, and I hope you members of CoS will actually question some of the things your illustrious leader has done, because not everything he has told you is the truth, by a big fat long stretch.<br>
<br>
(I'd like everyone to know I posted that last post under Mrsaiyajin. Our cookies are turned on and forgot to log him out before posting. Iberar, you need to get the facts straight before you start rattling off about things you don't understand)<br>
<br>
Poppa, you can insult me all you want. I don't care. In my eyes that doesn't make you any less guilty if you don't admit to the things you've done.<br>
<br>
And I know the people who believe in truth and decency will wonder why I am so angry at you I would write these long posts to prove my point. Even all lies have an inkling of truth behind them, so if you want to look at everything I've said as a lie, you will know SOMETHING has happened that went wrong.<br>
<br>
Antonelf, I did trust Poppa you are right, I should not have. You are completely right. The purpose of this thread is to prevent others from making the same mistake.<br>
<br>
Thank you all who listened to my rants and flames with some abjectivity.<br>
Suck my nonexistant nuts all ye who just insulted with no care for what has actually happened to people.<br>

<br>
Okay Suria and Soreah, <br>
<br>
I'm not actually going to stoop down to your level, and start using schoolyard tactics, that I grew out of 20 years ago. However I'm going to be Blunt with you: <br>
<br>
Suria - Your actually one of the few ex-CoS that has ever been &quot;Kicked&quot; out of the guild. After you proved your Honor (Something you seem to be very proud of) by defending Rosalena, when HE quit CoS and Maliciously created strife, using lies, and vague promises, to Recruit from the guild, while poppa was away on another server. The final straw, was when you Incited Larenzo into Pulling trains on Jessamyn, and then arguing the issue with Poppa, when he told you to Stop what you were doing, and Undo what you had done. You expected far more than you deserved.  It is a huge feat, to be &quot;Kicked&quot; from the guild,  as it requires a Unanimous vote from all the officers to remove anyone from the guild. Do you realize how difficult it is to get a Dozen people to agree on anything?<br>
<br>
Soreah - Being your Boyfriend Quit, because You no longer had a Place in CoS.<br>
<br>
The rest is of no relevance, as you apparently, have no clue why they are no longer in the guild. They quit for their own reasons. If they have a problem, let them take the stand and claim their right to flame. You've no right to speak on their behalf.<br>
<br>
Although I don't think this is the response you were after. Is it? It seems to me You want to rouse some anger out of Poppa, and the whole of CoS, just to  make us look bad. Not going to happen. We're all too busy finding great amusement at your expense.<br>
<br>
In my own opinion, Poppa is the BEST Guild Leader, Luclin has ever seen. He has never betrayed CoS, or any of its members. When Marc left the Server, Poppa stayed with the guild, went to Mith Marr demanding its leadership. He rebuilt the guild from a handful of players. Even though he was approached by the majority of Guilds formed by friends and colleagues of CoS's decimated ranks. He gave up his own leveling, so he could unselfishly help out HIS guild. He does nothing but give, and promote loyalty and trust amongst our stable mates. He used to tell me while we were recruiting, &quot;Newbies learn; Jerks never do&quot;.<br>
<br>
Yes, Poppa is blunt, but he is respectful, hes not going to dance around, or sing to you lullabies, so you will feel better, about what he is going to say.   He will demand attention, from the people he leads. He will tell people what to do, when its absolutely necessary. He can be Strict, and will have his reasons for being so. If he comes off harsh sometimes, its probably because: Hes in a hurry, and doesn't have time to explain himself to players like they were children, or feels others are doing something wrong, that needs immediate attention. Hes going to expect the people he plays with, to learn from their past mistakes. He doesn't use /ignore, and he wont let his emotions overrule his judgement. I've never found him, closed to any discussion, but be prepared for rebuttal<br>
<br>
Unlike what you would have others believe, Suria, He has NEVER Mistreated anyone that I know. <br>
<br>
Poppa is the type of person to say, &quot;If you don't like it, you can choose to leave&quot;.<br>
<br>
Even looking back along this thread, other than yourself, and soreah; There is nobody else talking @#%$ about poppa.<br>
<br>
Its been long known, Poppa doesn't take @#%$ from anyone. If he has something to say, he will say it. If he makes a Mistake, he will stand his Ground and take his medicine with the best of them. <br>
<br>
You'd be best off, Quitting while your ahead. Passing the buck, when you only have yourself to blame, is simply foolish.<br>

ROFLMAO!  Once again I see the crosshairs of evolution drifting over your forehead.  Time for the gene pool to cleanse another one.<br>

I think this thread wins the award for &quot;most text that no one read or gives a @#%$ about.&quot;<br>

Too much drama in a big guild for me.  Any given day, I can log on to my small guild and say 'Anyone want to go kill stuff' and have others want to do it.  <br>
<br>
I have some friends in CoS, many of them from back in the day when Faiths Kingsmen were around.<br>
<br>
The only question I have is: You have to have 12 people VOTE to disband someone from the guild?  Hell, if someone needs to go, I kick them, Im not waiting around for 11 others to agree with me.  =)~<br>
<br>
Hope you all get some sort of resolution to this issue.<br>
