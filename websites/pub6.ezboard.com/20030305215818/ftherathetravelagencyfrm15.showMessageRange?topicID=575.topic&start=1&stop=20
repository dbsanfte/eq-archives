Came back at his bind point with only a handful of items, OT hammer in hand, bags missing and only wearing no drop items. <br>
Also the Seb Key was missing..(appears someone at that caliber never been to seb before) and a bag full of peridots  <br>
<br>
The thief also cleaned out all the valuble droppable items in the bank and took a large sum of plat and left 36 for me to spend.<br>
<br>
So I petitioned GM-Vaylin Wensday night and he said according to his list I made a trade with a shady toon named Grimus. <br>
<br>
Once I got the name, I immediately contacted him and said hello and asked a few questions as Tirent. His answers were &quot;leave me alone and I dont know what you are talking about&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

Grimus 23 DE enchanter in &lt;Freedom Knights&gt;<br>
<br>
Okay I've just logged on about 21:30 and said greets to the guild while heading towards Kael to slay King Tormax last night. My first tell to the person who had Tirent's stuff (from what GM-Vaylin said.. you cannot doubt that)<br>
<br>
What I said first to him was &quot;Do you have Tirent's stuff or made a deal with him?&quot;<br>
<br>
Lets see what Grimus has to say about it. I have to admit on being a little forward about it, you would too if you found out who cleared out your stuff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

[Wed May 29 22:01:33 2002] You told Grimus, 'Well have fun with your greedy self with Tirent's stolen items, have fun with that nobles robe '<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats when he stayed silent and did not reply from that point on.<br>
<br>
Dunno what does that mean in his replies, I got the evidence from GM-Vaylin that Tirent indeed traded his items to Grimus (which I did not do)<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep an extra eye out for this low-life shop-lifting kid, probably holding Tirent's Cone of Mystics and wearing a Noble's robe.<br>

<br>
 I've tried to make contact through e-mails and with no responses.<br>
I think its just odd that he suddenly became another person. Drache/Wodin/spiel/innsanicon allowed at least 4 or 5 other person on to his account... I dont even know who plays him anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sent a tell in game to one of his toons and asked how he was. All I got was. &quot;I don't know&quot; and I also asked if this is the real Drache/wodin and got a vague reply that he doesnt even know who his friends are.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also watch out who Wodin/Drache/innsanicon/spiel/Taijitsu really is.<br>

At least among peeps you don't know and trust IRL.<br>
<br>
Chalk this up to life experience if Vaylin can't do anything about it.<br>
<br>
He's pretty good at intimidating people tho, get him to summon this kid into the GM jail and start grilling the real story out of him.<br>
<br>
Even if he didn't steal the items himself, if he is wearing em, he knows how he got em.<br>

Another question would be; who could possibly have your account pass? The only person that would be allowed know my pass is a RL friend that I could talk to eye-to-eye in case something happened; <br>

(also trying to get his statement in game about doing the trade and etc.)<br>
<br>
Since someone who got on one of account and did a trade, the items cannot be reimbursed from one of the reimbursement policy, all trades are final. (Items cannot be returned according to that policy)<br>
<br>
I'll get a statement from GM-Vaylin in game about the name of the person who was doing the trade and post it here... The weasels are still out there frolicking with stuff that they did not earn.<br>
<br>
I belive I saw a flame on someone who lend out a Cloak of Flames to another guildy, then the person who took the CoF camped and kept it. I heard it was resolved by GM Vaylin taking the CoF and destroying it. Due to the reimbursement policy for trades. Darn dishonest people, ruining other people's fun and hard work at getting their items... <br>
<br>
<br>
Yep, that means I'm out of luck but I have been informed who was at the receiving at of the trade. This thread is to inform the people on the rathe, expose and let everyone know who's the no good back-stabbing, greedy creep out there. (Drache/Innsanicon/wodin/spiel)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tough luck for me, now I've learned my lesson the hard way  <br>
<br>
-<br>
The only person that would know my account info would be<br>
Drache/Wodin/Taijitsu/Innsanicon/Spiel. After that Sunday.. he's been acting very strange and I've even ask Grimus before accusing him of being present during the trade if he knows Drache. Grimus Knew Drache very well it seems...<br>
The thing that got me suspicious about spiel/Innsanicon/wodin is that they are all tagged in the same guild Grimus is in. <br>
I've tried talking to Spiel/Innsanicon/wodin and kept getting weird and vague answers to all my questions. A couple days after the &quot;incident&quot; I've sent a tell to Drache saying &quot;Hello, how's it going man?&quot; and got &quot;I don't know&quot; as a response. <br>
<br>
Drache also let RL friends on his account and trying to contact the real guy is almost impossible... if there he had any friends that no good back-stabbing rascal.  <br>
<br>
<br>
So watch out for the two timing dishonest weasel Drache/Innsanicon/Wodin/Spiel/...<br>
Just another person who will probably scam his way through the game and ruin other people's fun along the way so watch out for them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
