I was sitting here in my office typing up a proposal and I recieved a phone call. It was my fiance' telling me to get to a tv as fast as I could. She was crying and I could tell that something was very out of place. I immediately got to a tv and thought what I was seeing was a movie preview or something. Then it hit me. This was for real! I sat there crying and thinking of all the people lost. Seeing the monumental buildings come down and thinking to myself.... OMG this can't be happening. Then a few moments later... the tv showed Live on CNN the other plane hitting the tower. Then I thought to myself.. What is next? Then rumors of other planes moving about started scaring me. What next? Where? Then news hit that the Pentagon had been attacked. Why would someone do this?<br>
<br>
Now I reflect on the past and see that there are true Heroes. Not just the firefighters, or policemen, or medical services... not just the Red Cross, united Way, or even the Armed Forces... the true heroes are all of us here living and the ones that have died in tragic events such as 9-11. The American citizen is the hero. No country in the world has what we have. Freedom to form and operate with pride, dignity, and honor. The ability to feel the sorrow of the loss like it was one of our own family members.<br>
<br>
Now on a side note...<br>
<br>
Besides my family here in my real life.... besides the friends and people of my community.... above the family I have in Everquest and the time I spend each night having fun with you guys... nothing can compare to the family that I have here in the US as well as the friends to the US. For this... I say... thank you all here on the Rathe board who have been my friend and been there to make me smile. Thank you for being a family to me.<br>
<br>
To those who died on Sept 11th.... You will not be forgotten.<br>

<br>
I remember driving into work and listening to the radio.  I was listening to the Howard Stern show laughing about whatever crazy topic they were talking about when suddenly he stopped talking and announced that a plane had crashed into the Wold trade Center.  My first thoughts were &quot;could this be a joke&quot; but there was something in his voice that told me it wasn't.  Shortly afterwards, he announced that another plane had hit the other tower and then I knew without a shadow of a doubt that it was a terrorist attack.<br>
<br>
The rest of the day was somewhat of a blur as I waited by the radio or the only TV in the building with the rest of my co-workers listening for news.<br>
<br>
It is a day I will never ever forget.  My heart goes out to all the victims of this tragedy as well as their friends and families and I give praise to the milions of Americansthat gave of their time, money and sympathy to help others get over this aweful event.<br>
<br>
We as a country have gone on and shown the rest of the world that you may wound us but you cannot take away that which makes us Americans<br>
\<br>
God Bless America and Good bless us all!!!<br>

Had spent all night playing EQ (no one ever does that.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and was about to go to bed when my Mom called me in the living room with panic in her voice.<br>
<br>
I remember standing there in total shock. She was sitting on the couch, her hand over her mouth saying 'oh my lord...' over and over.. i must have stood in the same spot for a good hour, watching the first tower begin to crumble, then the second tower being hit by the plane... people fall from the buildings.. I finally moved to the couch, and we sat there, one hand clasping the others, the other holding a cigarette chain smoking as we watched the horror. <br>
<br>
Around 7:00am my time, i called my Father (who lived in Los Angeles). I told him to turn on the news, and he had already been watching. I then called my friend Kevin, who lives in New Jersey (Secaucus) and we talked about it for a bit. He could see the smoke from his window, it was a horrifying thought. <br>
<br>
We talked about how I had just been out there, We had just been to the towers and how everything was so sureal. This wasn't something where the good guys would ultimately win, this wasn't something where if you kept watching the news reports there would be a happy ending. This was absolutely horrifying.. <br>
<br>
I remember the anger i felt, i remember the pain. I remember every time i saw the news talking to another family that was effected i burst into tears. <br>
<br>
Last week, a lady from the church across the street from my work came in to bring us some pamphlets. They are holding services today at noon and at Six PM. <br>
<br>
The picture on the pamphlet had a fire fighter carrying a person over his shoulder out of some rubble. I cried again, i couldn't control it. <br>
<br>
Thank you to the Heroes of that day, to the men and women serving to protect our nation and those who are fighting the war in the middle east. <br>
<br>
My thoughts and prayers go out to our nation... in rememberence of this day. May we never forget it, but always strive to grow from it.  <p><b>

There was also flags and banners and posters all over the tollbooths and overpasses today and it really hit me pretty hard. All I ask is everyone just take a moment and say a prayer for everyone that was effected by 9/11.<br>

<br>
I started my new job in midtown (thankfully) on Sept 10, 2001<br>
<br>
On Sept 11, 2001, I walked home from midtown to Astoria in Queens.  It was perhaps one of the strangest times in my life.  Walking in those huge crowds of people . . . orderly, calm, almost quiet considering the quantities . . . rumors flew . . . the black smear of smoke our background.  <br>
<br>
After growing up in Ohio, all I expected from New Yorkers was rudeness.  There is so much more.  I was able to find my way home in a city that I had spent all of 8 days in, because people were incredibly helpful.  I shared cigarettes with a few and traded stories . . . perfect strangers.<br>
<br>
That evening I had dinner with everyone I knew in the city at some Greek restaurant.  We reflected on what this would mean for us (we had all moved within the last two months) and how much harder it would make our lives.  The meal was free, the owner was giving away free food that night.  Strangely, of the 9 people at the table that night . . . my wife and I are the only ones here a year later.<br>

<br>
Suddenly, the whole morning's plan was thrown out of my head as I stood there stunned at the events playing themselves out on the television screen only a few feet from me... I do not remember how I made my way to the couch... all I remember are the vivid pictures burned into my brain as clearly now as they were when it happened... I remember crying for hours... rocking in fear, worried about my friends in that city... empathizing for the thousands of affected families.<br>
<br>
Somehow I made my way to work.. I was late... no one cared... the radio was on for the entire journey, I recall them saying that the airports were closed all through the US... the TV's throughout the building (normally displaying company messages) were invariably tuned to the American News stations. People hugged a lot that day... as a multinational corporation, our company had a great many people who were concerned or who had family in New York or DC. There were counsellors there to help those who needed it...<br>
<br>
Then the news started to come in from the Airport... hundreds of planes were being re-routed from the US with thousands of passengers who would be stranded without lodging... but wait... what is this? There were hundreds and hundreds of volunteers also showing up at the airport, ready to care and feed these stranded travellers!<br>
<br>
On September 11th, 2001, I cried for many reasons.<br>
<br>
I cried for the loss and pain of everyone affected by these events.<br>
<br>
I cried for the loss of our sense of security while on our home soil.<br>
<br>
And I cried, overcome with pride at the selfless response of my Canadian brothers and sisters as they rallied to respond to an event of a magnitude which was never foreseen. <br>
<br>
I may not be American, but I am crying again today in rememberance of those tragic and heroic days. My heart goes out to you all.<br>

He lost  alot of his good cops, some that i known since i was born and use to take for rides in the police car as  a baby .  Alot of   good people died. Too many   to be exact as  i looked at the paper this morning and on front page is a full page of people who died i think it was around 3000 people.. There was times where i didnt get to see my dad for  months at a time, but he did have alot of stories to tell.. but  he  sais the only thing that   ever bothered him during this, was the sound of people hitting the ground who jumped out, he said there is     nothing  like that sound and its a sound you wish you would never     hear...<br>
<br>
I send my  condolences to those who lost<br>

I awoke that morning with my car packed all set to begin a 3 day journey across country to visit my sweetie Draclorath for a month vacation. My son came over from next door crying telling me to turn on the tv and when i did i saw the 2nd plane hit , i sat with my son in horror and shock crying till he had to go to school.<br>
  I then braced myself and got in my car to begin the long journey from texas to virginia, and the entire day was just surreal, cars pulled over to the sides of the roads total strangers holding eachother and crying, each stop i made along the road from gas stations to food stops i cryed and talked with total strangers, hugged children etc. Each night i stopped i cryed and called folks when i could get thru to them on my cell phone as i watched the news unfold. <br>
  Needless to say those 3 days will forever be burned into my mind. I cry again today watching the coverage and will probably cry off and on today as we as a nation come together and remember and mourn those that were lost, and remember the fallen heros who desperatly tryed to save others.<br>
  Around the world people will mourn and remember those lost, and remember those other nations that came to our aide during this terrible tragedy. And yet again remember that its NOT over by a long shot.<br>

<br>
Time heals all wounds, or so they say. <br>
When we look back and think of that day, <br>
But the scars that remain, you can not see, <br>
They remain a part of you and me. <br>
<br>
The Twin Towers strong and proud, <br>
tumbled that day admidst the crowd. <br>
We cried aloud as we watched them fall. <br>
The lives lost touched us all. <br>
<br>
A year has past, as we look to the sky. <br>
A year gone, we still wonder why. <br>
Our lives have changed, nolonger carefree. <br>
The cost we pay for tragedy. <br>
<br>
So to the people we have lost; I dedicate to you. <br>
The grace of God, to see your families through. <br>

This was posted on our guilds webboard but I felt it needed to be placed here for everyone to see. I know today has been a day of rememberence for us all. Im going to cut and paste what I added on our guild webpage as well......<br>
<br>
I really dont know what to say about this anymore. 9-11 is the day that I will never forget in my life. I have never been one to express feelings. I usually hold it all in and deal with it in my own way. But today is just a day I have been broke down all day. All those people lost in one day. Ya know I look back on that day and all I really want to do is just lock myself in the house and do nothing. There are some really phucked up people in this world, I was just told as Im typeing this that not more then a mile from me a Walgreens had an Anthrax scare. I mean WTF, do these people have nothing better to do then thrive off the pain and misery of others? After 9-11-01 I have never been more happier to be an American all my life and it woke me up. Too many people take the things we have for granted and dont realize how lucky we have it. Nina hun I sit here and I read your poem with a tear in my eye right now. For those of us that are Americans just take a minute out of today and realize what you have. Go hug your mother or father. Pull them tight and dont let them go. Today is a day we should all be happy we are sitting here being able to do this.........For those of you that lost people on 9-11-01 I am sorry and pray for each that overtime your pain will go. Hug someone that you love and hold close to you. Be safe guys and let today be one that you take that extra step to help or hug or make someone you love feel even closer..........<br>

I went to sleep and slept all day , not aware of what was occuring.  When I awoke that evening , I was informed of what happened , and was shocked.  Although the events of 9-11 were very tragic and is something that I agree should never have happened . For me the events that occurred on 9-11 , were no where near the most shocking for me that occurred that week. <br>
<br>
For me , the most tragic thing that occurred that week , was in the aftermath of things .<br>
<br>
Talking with my co workers and associates , how many of them , were taking such a passive stance in all that had happened , and stated that we deserved what happened .  <br>
People living here in the USA , living under the freedoms and rights that were fought for so long ago ,and using those freedoms to state their opinion while claiming their  freedom and rights(the same freedom and rights that those that perished in 9-11 died for) to do exactly that, which to me makes them no better than those that commited the act that was done. <br>
<br>
<br>
Being force fed news day in and day out about it( personally I hate and abhor News . It is generally negative , and it is HEAVILY BIASED , not to mention that I trust reporters about as much as I trust an Honest Lawyer), and seeing reports right and left , dis crediting our government , and feeding the terrorists right and left with golden spoons , giving them everything that they were hoping for. <br>
<br>
And then lastly months down the line , to see the government becoming once again passive in the way that things are done , so that it may all happen again. <br>
<br>
Its high time that the USA began to look out for the USA , and let the rest of the world deal with itself .  <br>
<br>
We have spent so much time dealing with the rest of the worlds problems , and the worlds security and safety , that we failed to see a hole in our own security and safety , as it was taken for granted. <br>
<br>
Did we deserve what we got ? The answer to that is NO . No country , Nation , or person ever deserves what happened. <br>
<br>
Could we have done something to prevent it? Yes , absolutley without a doubt. <br>
<br>
What I will remember about 9-11 , is the needless loss of life tha occurred, because we as a nation were to concerned with what was going on with the rest of the world thousands of miles away , instead of being concerned with what was in our own back yard.  And the &quot;waking of the Sleeping Giant&quot; , to take care of these terrorists , only to have it lulled back to sleep, so that it may be suprised again .   That is the true tragedy here. <br>
<br>
And that is what will be remembered most. <br>
<br>
I pray for the day when our leaders finally see the light , and decide that its time to do something . <br>
<br>
And I pray that the events of 9-11 will never be repeated, and  that God (regardless of religion) will Intervene, cause if he doesn't . Other events such as 9-11 are around the corner , and there is nothing that will stop them .... <br>

<br>
Hmmm... 9-11-01.  I had woken up for work around 9:20am PST, showered &amp; rushed out the door.  Got to work and my co-workers were talking about what happened and I started watching the clips, listening to the radio and reading all I could about what happened.<br>
<br>
I was in shock.  Could not fathom what was happening and happened.  We didn't have a TV that day, just radio and internet to keep up.  I normally don't watch much news because like I read earlier I think they are exceedingly biased &amp; causing half of the problems by getting all the bad/nasty stuff out to everyone in seconds which just gives more unstable people ideas of what to do.<br>
<br>
I watched the news and read all I could for the next few days and made sure our flag was out every morning at half mast for the duration.  I remember about a week later going to a candlelight vigil at a local park and seeing all the different people gathered to pay tribute.  It was moving.<br>
<br>
I read the thoughts and memories now and my heart is still wrenched at the thought of all who died and the anger that was kindled that day flames anew.  I keep thinking of Tom Clancy's novel Ranbow Six and how an orginization like that to take down the bastards that did this and all the others like them that would kill innocent people without regard just because they think differently.  Fanaticism is NOT a good thing.<br>
<br>
I don't know what else to say and will end this with one more thought.  I heard about this site on the radio yesterday and thought I would share for people that might be interested.<br>

<br>
What I remember of 9-11.  <br>
<br>
For some reason, I curved away from the morning ritual of watching the news, to get the traffic, see if its going to rain see what the polution level warning would be for the day, I was busy helping get the kids ready for school.  Oddly enough they like catching the news for at least the weather reports and traffic reports (all though they ride bikes to school) in the morning.   For some reason, I turned the TV off before it all happened.<br>
<br>
About the time the first plane hit 7:45am (CST).  Was saying good bye to the youngest going to elementry school.  <br>
At 8:05 - was seeing to the Eldest, getting her off to Jr. High or Middle school.<br>
Just a few min later I left the house to catch the bus to work.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough most everyone on the bus didn't not know of the situation either.  The bus ride is 28 min from the stop I get on, to downtown Dallas.  About 5 min after the bus left the station a woman behind me got a phone call and said something about a helocopter hitting the  Pentigon, and them maybe a plane.  Ten min later, my sister called me and said &quot;OMG did you hear?!  Planes have hit the World Trade Centers and the Pentigon, and they got a couple of planes missing!!&quot;    I'm on my way to downtown, not much I can do.  Word spead through out the bus, someone broke out a pocket radio and turned it on... the rule of no loud radios on buses was ignored for the day....<br>
<br>
I got down town, get off the bus at my usual stop and start my 4 block walk to work.. the bells at Rememberance Square are chiming... the first time in 2 years I had heard them Chiming.  I get to work.  I work right next to the Adam's Mark (where Dallas Fan Faire was)... Just across the street, 30 story building.   <br>
<br>
I sat and watched one of the many TVs that were setup.  I watched the 2nd tower collaps.. I missed the first one.  I spent the day, everyone but the call center was sent home (some damn suite made the choice that the 10 people of tech support should stay there on the 30th floor and work.   For those that don't know, Dallas Love Field is just a couple of north of my building.  So frequently in the days previous and even today see the jumbo jets pass the Dallas Skyline.    Every building in downtown closed that day, for the first time that I remember.<br>
<br>
From what I understand from some of the co-workers who went home early, I am kinda happy that I didn't leave early, there were near riots at several of the train stations and bus stations.<br>
<br>
Getting home that night, the children... probably too young to understand the importance, wanted to watch cartoons.  I borrowed one of their small TVs and set it on the kitchen table and watched the news and the Presidents Speech.  <br>
<br>
In the days that followed the co-workers chiming up on how we deserved it, after a day or two of several people bickering at the 2 doing this, I make a very long post, rather uncharacteristic of me and the tread shut down.    It was one of those, I have family that are firefighters, I was a fire fighter (want to go back), and I have been in the towers a few times, though the last time was in 96.  I basicly told them &quot;How the hell dare you to say we deserved this!&quot;   The tread stoped at that, why, I guess because I said what most others felt, and the 2 opposed people didn't want to go on any more.<br>

<br>
Wake up 9ish am EST to my phone rining (which is unusual because my first class was 11:20 so I never woke till past 10. I answered the phone, my mother (an American, where I am Canadian) said 'turn on the tv' before saying hello. I asked what station, she told me 'any channel with news'. First thought... Cnn. <br>
<br>
I turned on Cnn. There was the first tower smoking, I don't recall if the second plane had hit yet or not. I asked my mom, (who I assumed had been watching for hours at least from her office) &quot;What happened?&quot; Her: &quot;Terrorists crashed a plane into the building&quot; Me: &quot;Who did this?&quot; Her: &quot;Who do you think, the Arabs&quot; <br>
<br>
We chatter for a bit, she was crying, she is a very patriotic American. To be honest though, for me, the ONLY thing that seperated this day from any other, was that NY is only a few hours drive from where I live.  <br>
<br>
Terror, is nothing new to me, or my family. It wasn't on sept. 11th either. Sure, I was shocked, I remember the entire day too, wondering if Canada's great CN Tower would fall that day as well, worrying about family/friends around North America, particularly in the U.S.  <br>
<br>
Well, like someone above said, I hoped it would wake the slumbering giant from it's unshakable complacency. It did, praise the lord... but only for a short while. I am also upset with the complacency the world as it is now. <br>
<br>
So yes, Sept. 11th was a big, and memorable day for me. Yes it is forever etched in my memory, and I do definetely sympathize with all those who lost family. However for me, terror is, and has been real for a long time. It is, and will continue to be a clear and present danger. What I am saying is that sept. 11th was not the first, last, or only act of terror, and I would like to see the world memorialize the other victims of terror, world-wide. Oklahoma city, Philipenes, Israel, France, Germany, all over the Muslim world etc..  I wish people would recognize that the U.S. is not the only victim, and realize that even if the threat of Al-Qaeda has been reduced,  no one is safe until all terror has been destroyed.<br>
<br>
Well that is my piece, hope I didn't come off as harsh, but that was how I remembered the day. I remember it as a wake up call to the world, and not new news to me. <br>
<br>
Peace. <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif"</img> <br>
