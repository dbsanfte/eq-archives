I would like to suggest that the Clan of Unity take over responsibilities for leading raids. I have heard it said several times that it is preferable for a guild to lead rather than a single individual, and since Clan of Unity is generally a large percentage of the raid attendees, I think that this would be a great choice.  <br>
<br>
I have heard that Clan of Unity is getting ready to get into rotations  on their own, but I think that at this point if we lost their membership on CoG raids, we would be in serious trouble. I have had the opportunity to group with several members of this guild on each raid I have been on and I have to say I have always been very impressed. I think they would make a great leading body.<br>

They have the organization and players to do well.  Unfortuantly this means that they can also do the planes on their own.  And in fact are doing so.<br>
<br>
KGC rules prohibit so called double dipping.  A guild that is planes capable cannot lead a seperate alliance on a plane raid as well.  This is why the Silver Daggers had to stop leading KcoG plane raids when the Sacred Band entered the rotation.<br>
<br>
Now this rule is kind of bendable.  CoU *could* in fact still lead KCoG raids within the KGC guidelines, but only so long as they arent needed to break into the plane.  In other words, they need to prove that KCoG on their own without outside assistance can do so.  The hassles of doing this and their own raids means that in reality it isnt really feasable.<br>
<br>
KCoG isnt losing its seeding in the rotation.  I will still be around to list us and request plane days should the need arise.  We can also get additional people access if the need arises as well.  I just wont be running regular raids.  Hopefully I'll have something once a month or so.   Still need to organize a PoA raid one day.<br>
<br>
But really what is needed is a guild or several people to step forward who arent from planes capable guilds to do these things.  Otherwise the hassles and restrictions become headaches.<br>
<br>
Good idea.  I thought of it too.  Which is, of course what makes it a good idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Heh, just kidding.  Heck, lead a raid or two yourself Havyk.  heh.<br>

Havyk is my first 50+ character and all of my plane/dragon raiding experience has been within the last couple of months, under the command of yourself and Kommisar. I've been to both Hate and Fear twice now and have learned quite a lot watching how things are run, but I am certain I have more to learn than not.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how well I will be able to fill your roll, but I would certainly give it my best shot. I currently plan, run and pull (but I'm no monk, so I loves me sum enchanters) for raids for my current guild and our allies, although the most we ever get together is three to four groups. In addition, virtually all of my EQ experience has been spent grouping and a great deal of it as a puller. I think this has helped me develop a good sense of group dynamics and judging what a group can handle. This seems to me to be an important qualification for a Raid Commander.<br>
<br>
If I am chosen to lead, I would ask everyone a favor: if you have contacts in guilds that are currently doing their own plane raids, ask if I would be allowed to tag along on some of their raids so that I can learn more how others run them. I know that I have alot to learn, but I learn fast, and would be willing to do my best for everyone.<br>

In fact I did...I'm guessing EZ Board burped again.  Oh well.<br>
<br>
Anyway, of course I and most of the rest of us are around.  You simply need to ask for any assistance or help you might need.  As time goes on I have realized that I, and other former raid leaders, cannot just step up and help.  We need to allow others to do things on their own and to make their own mistakes.  That means we cant just volunteer to help.<br>
<br>
At the same time, our being there only servers to bring up comparisons between how say I did things and you will.  I dont mind helping where I can, but I think I'd be better used as a resource you can talk to than an actual raid second or anyhing.  Still, if you feel you need actual help you need only ask.  Nothing wrong with admiting when you dont know the answer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as a vote or anything.  Thats not really how things have worked here.  Doesnt mean it cant change, but as I and Kommisar and Haemish have said the way to do this is simply to post a raid.  People will show up or not based on how they feel.  If you wait till you get 40 people commiting, you'll never get off the ground.  Its why I never used the sign up lists as more than a guide.  Half the people on it never show up, the other half are walk-ins.<br>
<br>
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, if you want to do this, then do it.  Send me a tell ingame or an email or post here and we'll work the details and days out.  Its not as simple as saying I want wednesday or something, but its pretty close.  As for additional help, all one needs do is ask.<br>
<br>
Its a bit late and I'm frazzled a bit.  Perhaps I can clear stuff tomorrow.  heh.<br>

As kellory explained we are just now getting on planes ourselves and dont qualify any longer for CoG raids.<br>
<br>
Without The experience we gained from Kellory and crew this wouldnt have been possible.  This is one of the reasons someone must step up and take control of CoG and there raids.  <br>
<br>
The best thing about CoG is the chance to team and play with new people.  I have met some nice players and had some real fun on these raids.  This is what the game is all about to me.<br>
<br>
Leading raids takes patience and many bottles of tylenol but some people can do it better then others.  Please remember that loot isnt the most important part of the game.<br>
<br>
CoU is willing to help in any way possible to make sure that CoG continues with its raids.  It is that important.<br>

This was before CoG had spot in the rotations. Basically AC requested requested the slot as there own and opened the signup's to the CoG. The host guild had final management staff and attendace. This fits in with all KGC rules as I understand it. I don't know how applicable that would be at this point with the CoG having its own spot in the rotation as it would go unused in this scenario.<br>
<br>
Food for thought from historical case. <p>Xalos <BR>

However, there are reasons why they dont generally like to do this.  In order for a guild to have a slot on the rotations they must prove they are able to break the plane on their own.  For example Fellowship of Faydark cannot request a slot on the Planes rotation because they are unable to break the plane on their own.<br>
<br>
Now then, if a guild can then presumably they can do much if not all of the plane on their own.  That being the case, opening the raid to CoG would only serve to add in a few extra people to the raid.  Most raids only have between 24-48 people on them.  This is to maximize the amount of loot and keep it to those who need it.  CoG is one of the few groups that will take 55+ people on up.  Different philosophies.  I would also point out that 3-4 groups can effectively clear Fear or even Hate.  Especially if they are 55+.<br>
<br>
What does this mean?  It means if another guild like CoU did it, then they would only be allowing a select few CoG raiders on their raids.  Also, they would be intentionally weakening their own guild since CoG raiders would/should be allowed to roll on all loot.  This means that they are using their time and days to help equip people they will probably never see again.<br>
<br>
In any event, only a very small group of CoG raiders, less than 12 in all likelihood would get to go on any given raid in this fashion.  This is one reason Harb and the Sacred Band eventually stopped running Plane Raids.<br>
<br>
It would really work a whole lot better if a small guild that was not planes capable and not in a planes capable alliance were to look at hosting both the Plane raids and dragon raids.  This would allow for the creation of several raid leaders, hopefully keeping them from burning out.  I'm not stopping a Planes capable guild from doing just what was propsed.  I'm just pointing out why in many cases it doesnt work to well.  If a guild wants to try it, by all means go for it.  But considering how open CoG loot rules are and attendence guidelines are, I dont see it working too well myself.<br>
<br>
But thats just my thoughts.  Perhaps someone has some ideas on how it could reasonably work?  If so, post here.<br>

I offered it up as an option as past lessons/methods are sometimes forgotten. <br>
<br>
   With that though it may take time for a guild, or multiple-guilds(really like that Idea) to step forward. The cycle has come round again with your retirement Kell, Also with Komm's in the Dragon raids. New expierences to be had new lessons to learn for those who take the lead. This can can be extremely fun, frightining and be a large hassle all at the same time. All who accept this role and fulfill it are strong people. <br>
<br>
  I've attended raids and events hosted by the CoG off and on for the last year. It is a great opportunity and I want to see it continuing with its success so that others can enjoy it.<br>

There is no reason why we cant take a couple of weeks or a month to relax everyone before finding someone else.  I figure eventually someone will step up for the same reason KCoG was originally formed.  Because someday someone will get bored and step forward.  Rushing things or finding a stopgap is only going to serve as a temporary solution.  No reason why we cant wait till a permanent solution comes to us.<br>
<br>
I would point out, my last raid was only 4 days ago.  We're still at the bottom of the rotation at the KGC in any event.  And will be so for another couple of weeks.  We had a 2-3 week vacation from plane raids coming up anyway.<br>
<br>
These raids are going to continue its because someone is going to step forward and say I'll do it.  Not because someone suggests a way someone else might be able to do it.  It might be tomorrow, it might be next month, it might be next January.  But eventually someone will.  KCoG was formed not to be a parasite organization, but as a means to help small guilds team together to take on large targets without having to form an uber guild or lose players to those uber guilds.  If that premise is still sound, then someone will step forward.  If isnt, then perhaps its time to let KCoG go.<br>
<br>
Neither the planes nor the dragons are going anywhere.  I'd prefer to find a permanent solution rather than a stop gap myself.  But thats just me.  I'm still waiting for someone, anyone, to say I'll do it, lets get together and plan it out.<br>
