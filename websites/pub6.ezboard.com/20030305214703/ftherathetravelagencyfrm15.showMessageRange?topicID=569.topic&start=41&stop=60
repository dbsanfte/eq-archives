<br>
If I was sitting around for 3 days (and Im not saying Chopz was) and was waiting for a mob to spawn, I don't think at the end of those three days I would be able to raise a force of lets say 20 people in 30 minutes. It would probably take me closer to 1 or 1.5 hours. If some large crew came in and took it just because they got more quicker I would be pretty pissed. I think if you've been there you should have the right to do something like rage. Par example, with rage you get what is it 12 hours to raise a force or something, and then it moves on? So for a smaller spawn 2 hours maybe, and then it moves on. <br>
<br>
It just seems kind of unfair to me to say that a week of my RL time is more valuable than 3 RL days of yours, especially if 3 RL days is all I can afford to spend on anything. I'm not justifying what CHopz did, that was lame, and is not to be debated, however I don't think it is fair to say you got here first, but we're big and powerful so we can do whatever we want. <br>
<br>
If it's obvious that someone isn't going to get together a force within a reasonable time, then yes, the people that got their @#%$ in order should be able to take it, and Im sure no one would have hard feelings. However, if the person is told do it now, or we get it, I could see where some anger may come into play. <br>
<br>
Key word is respect, if you want it, you've gotta give it. Obviously Chopz lost any semblance of respect by killing the turn in NPC because not only did it affect Jagganath, but had he been able to get together a force, he was killing of his own chances of doing it. <br>
<br>
I'm not saying BoTS was going to take it away from him, although that is the jist of what Im getting, but I think that in the future we should all be a little more respectful to the small guy, and if he needs 2 hours... well fine. In 2 hours a guild like BoTS can go and raid some other zone, come back, and if he was still sitting alone, ask for the mob, and take it. <br>
<br>
If we just start saying we can get together 20 people quicker, big guilds will always win, and the little guy will fall to the side. There is no way in hell my guild could get together 20 50+ people in a short period of time, but for raid intensive guilds it is common place. So basically all I'm saying is that I disagree with the &quot;race NPC&quot; idea although Im sure my opinion will change very little seeing as how the heirarchy on the Rathe works.. <p><img align=top src="http://www.alistriwen.onestop.net/gaza.gif"</img> <br>

<br>
6 people level 54+ to kill a level 57 shadowknight is about right, especially when all the other mobs around are level 30ish.<br>
<br>
We're not talking about racing to Ragefire. Ragefire is not a race mob. Drawing a compairison to ragefire is not appropriate for this discussion. We would not talk about the rotation on venril sathir, since he's a race mob. We also should not try to pretend ragefire is a race mob, he's not. Especially not for the purposes of examining a race situation. Ragefire is a special circumstance, and is the exception to the server rules on mobs. We have agreed as a server, that he can be left up for at least 12 hours with just one single cleric waiting on him. Any other mob going, that would be unheard of. No one would say a ranger could train Lozidel around for 12 hours free and clear. A level 60 warrior alone in sebilis claiming King while he waits for his friends to show up, is not going to get King if there is a full group there and ready to go. <br>
<br>
If you can't do the quest, and it's obvious you can't do the quest, you get to watch someone who can finish it. <br>
<br>
Unfair? <br>
<br>
Only when it's not working in your favor, maybe, but when you and your group of 20 people show up to another race mob like Venril or whoever, and there is a single level 60 monk trying to feign death claim the camp, you will be glad that you can say &quot;oops, I don't think so bucko, we have the force here and now, and you don't.&quot;<br>

Comparing a quest mob like the goblin to a non quest mob like lodizal or VS is NOT appropriate.  It is only fair to compare him to turn in quest mobs that spawn other mobs (i.e. Ragefire, pally spell quest guy in WC)  Non quest mobs are always race mobs.  Noone questions that.  The grey area comes in on the quest mobs.  <br>
<br>
Can you camp a quest mob?<br>
<br>
If so can you do it by yourself?<br>
<br>
Or do you have to have a killing force all camp it?<br>
<br>
If so what is the reasoning behind the rules being one way for Ragefire and another for the Angry Goblin?<br>
<br>
All these rules, like the Ragefire rules, are not Verant rules.  They are rules agreed to by the server.  The problem at the moment is that what people think the rules aren't all the same, and are inconsistently applied. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umareenadeviant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mareena Deviant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wog</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/31/02 3:53:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: While we're on the flame boards...</span><hr size=1> Aren't we missing the point here?  Was there any discussion going on between the players that gathered and the one already there? Did this Chops say &quot;hey, guys, I've been camping this and my force is incoming to complete a quest&quot;... it doesn't appear so.<br>
<br>
It does appear malicious to me (having only read what's here, not having spoken to any of those involved).  I've been camping Vessel in Cab for 3 weeks now with a mule sitting there... I've missed the chance to kill it 3 times now. Why? Because I have been unable to gather the force together to complete the task in a reasonable amount of time and another guild has moved in on two occasions and on the 3rd he despawned.<br>
<br>
Now if someone popped up beside me and said &quot;I'm taking this&quot; I would try to explain that I was trying to gather forces necessary.  If I knew I didn't have a chance, it'd be just wrong of me to stand and argue that sometime in the next week I want to do it.  <br>
<br>
Surely common decency has to prevail at some point, and killing the mob to stop another having a chance at it, is just plain wrong.  This Chops dude really needs to think about how he'd feel if someone killed his quest mob SIMPLY to stop him getting at it.  It happens enough by accident or ignorance (eg the WW dorf) without people knowingly doing it.<br>

Rog, do you know for a fact that Chopstickz didn't say anything to anyone about he having a force on the way to kill?<br>
<br>
Did anyone speak to him at all?<br>
<br>
Why IS one *Quest* mob (Ragefire), being treated differently from another (the Angry Goblin)?  Why was Chopstickz &quot;camp&quot; of a Quest Mob not respected?  <br>
<br>
If you, Rog, were one of the folks that Chopstickz had on the way, how would you view Jagganath's incursion on the Quest mob you had been camping, and had help on the way for?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utils.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tils</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.loopi.co.uk/bounce.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Conscript</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/31/02 6:36:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=569.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.loopi.co.uk/tils2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: While we're on the flame boards...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Did this Chops say &quot;hey, guys, I've been camping this and my force is incoming to complete a quest&quot;... it doesn't appear so&quot;<br>

And you get the answer from 2 tiny pictures which rog posted (and some text which people have typed..so can be worded differntly).  What about the rest of it?  Again i dont know but I dont have by far enough information to decide were bots running over him or was he being lame.<br>

<br>
if you don't have a force to kill a mob, you are not camping it...<br>
<br>
There is ONE mob on the rathe with this exception - ragefire, ONLY because of the nature of the spawn/results/server has agreed to it...<br>
<br>
And of course, we have the rotation mobs, where races don't apply.<br>
<br>
The angry golem, the dain ring war, several stop points in the coldain ring progression are the comparisons.  Not ragefire - ragefire is a 'server-wide-irregradless-of-guild-shared-mob'.........which was still steamrolled not too long ago by the people now defending this '1 fd monk holding (then blowing) a trigger mob to a quest that can be killed by a group, every 3 days'  to compare the 2 is reaching, far...<br>
<br>
In these cases ONE person can blow (and violate verant written rules) a quest out of spite.  You say this is a blue server, and it is - but in the above instances, PVP (at least a form of grief is possible). <br>
<br>
The point is that the mob to start/finish a quest that triggers a mob that cant be soloed, CAN be ruined by a solo person.  His actions were spiteful, immature and illegal. <p><a href="http://www.drow.org/eq/roster/viewprofile.php?name=Emil">Emil Sinclair</a><br>

As soon as the angry goblin popped he asked us for help. At that time the only class we were missing was a cleric (or a different kind of healer). When we found one, approx 15mins after the goblin had popped we started to head over. When we were about to enter FM chopstickz killed the goblin which Im not going to talk good.<br>
<br>
I dont know what he told to Jagg but I assume he told him he had people headed over to help him kill it. Although Jagg didnt do anything wrong I personally think it's a bit unfair to do so since Chopstickz was there first and had people comming to kill it. <br>
<br>
It may be good to make some (new) rules for turnin mobs, like giving some time for a person to gather a force. but thats just my oppinion. <p><p><font color="#008000"><a target="Cellar" href=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153936">Cellar</a>,  Grandmaster 60<br><a target="Eldarr" href=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=151628 ">Eldarr</a>, Wander 52</font></p>

That's the rule..whoever gets there with an appropriate force first gets the crack at the mob.<br>

Comparing this to Ragefire is ridiculous...for all the reasons that have already been posted so I'll not add to that. <br>
<br>
Killing the mob out of jealous spite is nothing more than the act of a selfish little punk who cant handle the fact that he lost out.  <br>
<br>
So let's just make everyone suffer !  Why the hell not?  It doesn't matter that he ruined it for everyone else right?  <br>

No way.  It was a pathetic move.  Learn to bow out gracefully and come back another day.<br>

<br>
   The &quot;Rules&quot; of the Rathe are as follows... <br>
<br>
   I'm done with a quest, have to do a final turn-in to pop the end mob and loot it's corpse to get the reward.  The mob is on a 3 day spawn time.  I sit in front of it's spawn point for 3 days.  The mob pops, and I start to assemble my guild.  A BotS/TL/SoT/NB et al. scout logs in,sees the mob and they come running.  They assemble the 20 odd players first (being in a much larger guild) so they get a crack at the mob, regardless of wether or not my force is incoming?  Somehow that just does not seem fair to me, as I've spent my time waiting for the turn-in mob to pop.  How could an unguilded player ever get anything accomplished from a quest like this?<br>
<br>
   I think there were 2 wrongs done here.  From the previous post it seems Chops did have a force incoming with a healer to follow shortly....for an unguilded toon, he obviously was doing what he could through tells as fast a possible...<br>

Regardless if he was there first and had a group coming  and there was already a group of peps there rdy to kill it Chops still had no right killing it.  This only shows me that he is a spoiled child who will attempt to ruin others fun if he cant get what he wants.<br>

That's nothing new. <br>
<br>
There is so much that is not only difficult, but out and out impossible to do in this game *without* a group of people who are in fairly constant contact and have a similar goal in mind. Go try to do a pick up raid of the Arch Lich or the Avatar of War and let me know how that works out for you, ok?<br>
<br>
(Keep in mind that the &quot;you&quot; in my flames are directed at an unnamed third party, and usually do not refer to a specific individual, unless named)<br>
<br>
This server doesn't have independant raids. If it should or not, I don't know, but it doesn't. <br>
<br>
Ragefire is the *only* quest type mob that is not on a race on this server. <br>
<br>
Name *one* other quest mob that people from all guilds will help with, that people will allow you to take 12 hours to gather forces for. Name one. G'head. <br>
<br>
The reason you can't, is because no other mob exists that works in the same way as ragefire. <br>
<br>
GET OFF THE RAGEFIRE BANDWAGON PEOPLE, it's a special case, and it always has been. <br>
<br>
Venril Sathir *IS* a quest mob, by the way: Ever hear of the wizard epic? <br>
<br>
Mobs that drop parts for quests are, by definition, quest mobs (mobs involved in the quest). Doesn't Lozidel have a note needed for a quest? Oh, could that be yet another quest mob that is in a race situation? <br>
<br>
Ragefire, in terms of game mechanics is not differant than Venril Sathir: Pops, drops a quest item and other loot.<br>
<br>
The *only* thing that makes a distinction is the rules of the server, and the *exception* is made ONLY for Ragefire. <br>
<br>
Sev? Rotation mob, if you don't have the people on to kill it in a reasonable time, you lose it. <br>
<br>
Phinnigal? Race mob, if you don't have the people to kill it, you lose it. <br>
<br>
Trak? First time, race mob, then it's a rotation: if you don't have the people to kill it, you lose it. <br>
<br>
Do you notice a theme here? Even on the civilized rotation system, if you don't have the people available to kill it, you lose it. It's a very straightforward system that makes sure those who can, do, and those who can't, don't @#%$ it up for those who can. <br>
<br>
So again, compairing this to a ragefire kill is misleading, wrong and used solely to support a losing argument. <br>
<br>
Cellar: Not that you will read this, or if you do, not that you will respond, you have a habit of slinking away from the flame boards when you are obviously wrong... (low blow? Maybe, but f'uck it, no love lost here)<br>
<br>
When Chopstickz killed the angry goblin, where were you and your force of people? Where? Were you in the Dreadlands? Were you in the Frontier Mountains? Because you *sure as hell* were not in the zone. <br>
<br>
Having the *intent* to be there, it not anywhere near actually being there. Sorry, you lost. Nice try, better luck next time. <br>
<br>
See, I know for a *fact* that SoT, KiC, LoM and pretty well every other guild that I can think of, BotS included, respects the &quot;first force able to engage gets the mob&quot; race rules. How do I know this? <br>
<br>
*BECAUSE THEY ARE ON ROTATIONS AND ABIDE BY THEM*<br>
<br>
I'll be more clear, in case that's not obvious enough: The people on this server, as a general rule, respect the way the mechanics of this server work. (Obviously some don't, hence this flame, but that's a small minority)<br>
<br>
I respect the way the rules of the server work. I know Jagganath does, I know that everyone in Droga that day, minus Chopstickz does. <br>
<br>
You know what would have happened if Chopstickz had a force there, ready to kill, or hell, even IN THE ZONE? Jagg would have said &quot;GG Chopstickz&quot; and he would have come back later: Proof? Drusilla Sathir is part of the quest he was doing. He lost the race to her on several occasions, I know because we talked about it. Sure, he would have liked to get the item, but not at the expense of rushing past a group already on the way to her. <br>
<br>
And I am 100% sure of this: I saw Chopstickz wearing a guild tag this week, of one of the major guilds on our server. I am deliberatly not going to bring them into this, however, as this has nothing to do with them and the subsiduary flames that they might get from this would be cheap shots, in my opinion. I would suggest that if he is well liked enough to get guilded in one of the top 3 guilds on the server, he's liked enough to have friends able to come help him. Cellar has supported this theory, and I embrace that idea whole heartedly.<br>
<br>
So lets examine this again, closely: <br>
<br>
Cellar claims a sufficent group was enroute. Giving the benefit of the doubt, lets say that Chopstickz had the mythical number of 20 level 60's all bearing down on Droga at warp speed. Great! Now we have disputed the claim that Jagg and friends ran roughshod over a monk who, because he was unguilded, didn't have the friends available to kill the mob. Chopstickz had the people on the way. They just didn't make it in time. <br>
<br>
Now we know, for 100% sure, that all that happened in this case, was that Chopstickz lost the race, and instead of being a good gamer about it, decided to f'uck everyone out of it.<br>
<br>
So now, we have a situation which *perfectly* parallels a race to Venril Sathir.<br>
<br>
Two race quest mobs, the Angry Goblin and Venril Sathir.<br>
<br>
(Both result in quest pieces, they are *not* a seperate category- as illustrated, the only seperate category that transcends guilds and alliances and rivalries is Ragefire. I know for Aes's Ragefire, we had members of BotS and SoT present, arguably the most open competing guilds on the server, and everyone got along fine.)<br>
 <br>
If SoT had won the race to VS over, say, Clan Bashemded, we would not have our monks train mobs from all over karnors into Venril's room. We'd say &quot;good luck guys&quot; and go back to whatever else we were doing. <br>
<br>
If Clan Bashemded had won the race to VS over say, SoT, they would not jump over us to engage VS first. How do I know? BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WHEN IT HAPPENED BEFORE. <br>
<br>
Therefore, in an indefensible conclusion, Chopstickz lost a valid race, and instead of colouring in the lines, decided that it was him or no one. Nice piece of work. <br>
<br>
So now, since we have established that there were two ready and able groups rushing for Droga to finish the quest, we have established this as a completely fair race situation, in which Chopstickz and his group *lost* and Jagg and his group *won*. <br>
<br>
Booya, you can all stop disagreeing now, since, quite frankly, continuing to defend Chopstickz position would be factually wrong. <br>
<br>
Thank you Cellar, for illustrating how this was indeed a situation where either Jagg or Chopstickz could have won, and Jagg's people got there faster, fair and square, and should have been given a &quot;GG Jagg&quot; and a clear path to the mob. This wasn't as I first assumed, a monk with no friends spitefully killing a quest mob. It was apparently a person who had lost a valid attempt at a mob killing the quest mob out of spite. I don't know if that's better, or worse... do you?<br>
<br>
If you would like to suggest that Jagganath would have killed the quest mob out of spite had he lost the race, you're welcome to open that can of worms, and get your textual face beat in by anyone who knows him at all. <br>
<br>
In any event, I'm sure that there will be people that disagree and find conclusions not supported by the accepted facts of the situation, and like I've said before, everyone is entitled to be wrong, but don't be surprized if people call you on it. <br>
<br>
Seems simple enough now, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
(And I must say, I am impressed with the level of the flames in this thread: no &quot;ur ghey&quot; type bullshit)<br>
