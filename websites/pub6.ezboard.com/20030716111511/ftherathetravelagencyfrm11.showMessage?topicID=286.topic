Look, anyone that knows me, knows I have always said that I've never had a good experience with members of the old Yamma Clan, and that most of my exposure to the new SoY has been bad as well; don't look at me and say &quot;gee, he likes them&quot;. I find that they disrupt the server disproportionately to the amount of people they have in the guild; In short, looking to me as a general supporter of SoY is the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>wrong</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thing to do. <br>
<br>
*HOWEVER*, the fact that no one said &quot;hey, uh guys? Where's our Zlandicar?!?&quot; makes me question if one was taken. If one wasn't taken, then what the fuck are we doing here? <br>
<br>
The argument can be made for a server burp; no doubt. The argument can be made for a zone crash; granted. But the argument can also be made *against* one. No matter how I personally feel about SoY, punishing on a possibility (not a probability) is not the way my mind works. No, I don't disregard the support that even members of SoY have given to the idea that Zland was solo'd. I personally believe that he was solo'd, by hook or more likely by crook, but the logical part of my brain tells me that there are alternatives to my personal bias. All I want to do, is make sure we explore the alternatives first. Witch hunt bad, careful consideration good. <br>
<br>
With the pop and subsequent kill yesterday, the dates fit for his standard 5 day pop time; that being the case, it effectively *rules out* a kill in between. Had he been killed on a rogue server/zone fart on, say, Tuesday, his 5 day pop time would be the 9th, not the 7th. <br>
<br>
As I've asked in the other zland thread- what are the possible pop times? Is it a variable 3 to 7 days? The rotation list itself is too jumbled by patch days, server downs, and the like in the turmoil of the new expansion patching to decifier a set pop schedule, at least, for me. <br>
<br>
What I see, from the page, is that he died on the 2nd and is due on the 7th. He popped on the 7th and was killed. If there is no 3 to 7 variable, the question is no longer &quot;can we punish a guild on the actions of one member in game?&quot; and is instead &quot;can we punish a guild for the actions of one member <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> on the RTA boards </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?&quot; <br>
<br>
The answer to that, resoundingly, is no, no matter how much he's pissed in the pool; being an asshole is not a violation of a rotation or posting rights. <br>
<br>
So again, 99.95% of this rests on the simple question; does this mob pop in 3 to 7 days, or 5, or what? Is it 5 days with a 12 hour modifier? 24 hour modifier? <br>
<br>
Answer that, and we can move on with whatever issues are left to us. It is that clear cut, when you look at it from the stance of someone who doesn't like or dislike SoY. <br>
<br>
Let me be blisteringly clear; I don't want favoritism. I just want *fair*. And if the facts don't bear out the idea of a Zland pop between the 2nd and the 7th, then fair is to let those SoY who were idiots on the boards take their lumps on the boards, and suffer the lessening of their reputation, and other consequences of not playing well with others. <br>
<br>
When it's my turn, or Clan Bashemded's turn to do something stupid in game or on the boards, I want to have established a system of clear thinking, and not bandwagon engineering, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">even though SoY are the authors of their own misfortune here.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Due process, a standard by which all civilized systems of justice are measured, must be present even in, or *especially* in the society maintained for a game, lest the system that we are so proud of, lose its civility. <br>
<br>
All I ask is that we realize that we have literally weeks to hash this out, and that jumping on SoY with both feet precludes a clean place to stand if we are wrong. <br>
<br>
To me, this feels rushed; I'm not sure we even waited for a Zland pop to see if the dates corrisponded in any way. Why not?<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong; personally, as a player who has no love lost, I say &quot;fuck it, no zland for you&quot;. But that is the exactly wrong way to make a decision that could well come back to haunt those who made it. <br>
<br>
So I say, show me that there is still a possibility of an available Zlandicar, if he was killed on the 2nd and again on the 7th. Provide me with a server down time that is not early sunday morning; show me one on monday morning, or late sunday night. Tell me that Zland can pop on a 3 to 7 day timer, and that our 'due' date on the rotation page is a usual average. <br>
<br>
But lets exhaust the possibilities, and not skim over them; as I would want for my guild should a similarly incomprehensible situation arise. (Note to my guild: It better not, get it? *grin*)<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's where I am. <br>

There is enough prove for me that Zutan did what he did in their own words. Also, when we were last clearing PoG to kill Tunare,  PoG and a few other zones crashed which means we lost Tunare. Does this mean the whole server crashed? No it did not, but still our mob was gone. Would we have known if we were not in the zone and had to get resses by a GM? No we would not have known. <br>
Also lately DN has been bugged. The Shade of J'haled Dar sometimes refuses to pop. This was end of february. One of our members has been sitting in DN for 4 days without any sign of the Shade. On our petitions to pop  the mob for keys to be handed in, GM said that it was indeed bugged and that they would REPOP THE ZONE but did not give us a time and date WHEN  he would do this. Does this mean the server went down? No, repops have happened before. Does this mean an extra Zland popped? YES it means an extra Zland popped.<br>

Zlandicar IS  or at the very least ONCE WAS soloable by a FD class, by using rat trains/AE/faction issues, etc.. and its a massive exploit (read: bannable offense). Which of course nobody in their right mind would flat out admit to it, but from all the posts I have seen, it seems to me they want to 'brag' about their SK soloing a seemingly impossible solo mob, but at the same time they don't want to blatantly admit it, due to repercussions that would entail.<br>
<br>
The whole defensive they have brought up about people being 'jealous' is insane, what would anyone be jealous about? Exploiting the shit out of a zone and a mob for a 'solo' kill? Hardly something to be jealous of, not to mention the fact that IF, and this is a big IF, Zland happened to be soloable by an SK, which would have to mean he was fearable into a wall somehow(WHICH IS STILL MOST LIKELY CONSIDERED AN EXPLOIT OF PATHING) I would think someone else on a FFA server would have probably have done it by now and posted as a brag on a class messageboard where everyone would have heard about it.<br>
<br>
I know the shaman board, warrior board, etc all have posts about large solo kills, hell I have even seen some dumb bards admit to soloing Klandicar with faction /assist bugs. However the only incident I ever remember hearing about from another server involving Zlandicar was somebody figured out a way to train 100 rats or so to Zland, and use some creative thinking(read: exploit) and bam dead Zlan to a 'solo' kill. This leads me to think it could be repeated, and I feel personally that he did this late or early one night, could not contain his swelling pride, and felt the need to narc himself out on the boards to 'brag'. I think once this backfired, he decided to ask people to proove he did it if they wanted to punish him.<br>
<br>
Here is my biggest problem with the entire issue to date. SoY refuses to take ANY stand on the situation. They float around with posts saying, yes he did it, no he didn't do it, he may or may not have done it, you have to have proof he did it, etc etc. All I can say to this is grow some balls, either defend your member's actions, or appologize for them, and take your punishment. It seems to me they want to be cocky, 'brag' that their member is 'uber' for doing the impossible(which honestly we all know was to exploit the shit out of poor Zlandy), but at the same time, to ALSO not take credit for it either...<br>
<br>
I would approve of any punishment for SoY that the majority of the RTA decided to go with. That being said, as I stated at the beginning of my post, I am in full agreement with Rogg. While SoY seems to have acted about as shady as a guy in a trenchcoat outside the local school playground, we do in fact have NO solid evidence to date, and as sad as it is to sit and do nothing, I feel it would be a mistake to punish them without further proof. <br>
<br>
What I would like to see as proof is 1) a full unedited log from a respected member of the community, where Zutan admits the wrongdoing and gives a full account of when, where, and how he did it. 2) A EQ GM to review those logs, verify if they are accurate, and review the time/area in question. If Sony finds enough evidence to support a suspension/banning of Zutan, that would certainly be enough for me to support a harsh penalty on SoY for the abusing of the RTA and furthermore by laughing at us and totally disrespecting all the guilds involed in this rotation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hutterr>Hutterr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fallen Shadows</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/10/03 8:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=286.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Soy Zlandicar suspension</span><hr size=1> not exactly respected members of the community, and I hate to bring it up AGAIN, but...<br>

Zutan did this on his own behalf, no one knew about it until after, and quite frankly I laughed at the idea of him soloing Zlandicar. So because someone solos a rotation mob and sells all the loot and lets most of the stuff just rot SoY should miss a turn on the rot? Does'nt sound fair. But if alot of people start 'soloing' a rotation mob it may be time to think about taking the mob off the rotation.<br>

Die?<br>

If he is a Server Up Mob, then there is your lost Zlandicar.

Valladar, the server went down on Sunday morning, 2.41am EST.  Zlandicar spawns upon server reset.  The spawn was killed by ED on Sunday 6pm.  There was no server reset after that until the scheduled respawn and kill by ADC on Friday. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kenaukamikaze>Kenau Kamikaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>VoF - GL</span><br>  Posts: 295<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/10/03 12:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=286.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Soy Zlandicar suspension</span><hr size=1> As far as I know server also reset on sunday night/monday norning.

I could post all over that I solo'd God, and it wouldn't matter without screenshots, logs, etc. The only differance is that people would not believe me about God offhand, but a FD class about Zlandicar is possible.<br>
<br>
While I do think that the statements read as admissions, there is nothing in the facts of the matter (Server ups and downs, spawn time calculations, etc) that adds up to a missing Zlandicar. <br>
<br>
If I go to the cops and admit to killing a friend of mine, but he's accounted for later on, I'm crazy and annoying, not a murderer. <br>

Do we want to examine that as a &quot;next case&quot; scenario? <br>
<br>
Possible punishments for attempting to, or successfully screwing with the rotation?<br>
<br>
Like, if I updated CB's kill of Zlandicar out of turn, so as to constantly remove whoever it is before us on the rotation of their turn?<br>
<br>
In retrospect, I don't think we can make up and assign a punishment, but we can certainly assess one in the future. <br>

We can not PROVE he killed Zlandicar, because the server has been unstable and been going up and down several times. A GM has repopped DN to spawn J'haled Dar Shade but we did not check if Zlandicar popped as well, and if we did not check we do not know, right??? (If you want to talk to the person who petitioned and who got answer that the zone would be repopped I can give you that name.)<br>
Also: while first bragging about his kill and his guildies - including the guildleader - joining in the chorus, they now see that they might get penalized so they say WE have to prove he did it.<br>
He SOLO killed Zlandicar (he says). SOLO = ALONE. So who is going to prove he did it? He can only prove it himself.<br>
*As to not damage parties of interest* blah blah blah. His lips are sealed and his once so booming voice about having killed Zlandicar solo has echoed away.<br>
Gone is the pride while the fear entered his heart that he has done something that might lead to a punishment of his guild. <br>
Words are withdrawn and posts are being twisted around by new posts to let them look like something else than they were intended to.<br>
I believe that he did what he posted: killed Zlandicar solo. And YES i DO speak for my guild. <br>
Kenshiiro has tried his best to *unring the bell* but I am not going to believe him that it did not ring at all.<br>
It MIGHT have been a FFA Zland, for instance the Zland that popped when the zone was repopped for Jhaled Dar and servers might have gone down shortly after. <br>
As we are not missing a regular spawn as far as we can calculate, I propose that SoY skips their next turn because they already had a Zland unless SoY PROVES TO US that it was a FFA Zland.<br>
No such thing as us proving he killed it. It was a solo kill and therefor he was alone. We are not going to turn the world upside down here. They show US it was an FFA Zland and they will not get a punishment. <p>Kenau Kamikaze, Phantasmist of VoF ,  Levlenna, Archon of VoF<br>

And that is where it hits, except - as Levlenna points out, if this was a solo kill, who was there to get screenshots?  I think you are looking on the wrong grassy gnoll that he was killed 3/2 and 3/7 - I accept they didn't kill him after the server down.  DN has always been buggy and crashy as hell.  Like you said, we can't prove they killed him, they can't prove they didn't.  However, we have a total moron running into the police station claiming to have done something, and a lot of bragging by no less than his GL confirming it.  Then you have about 8-10 different means of defense &quot;he did it on his own accord, he did it on an FFA Zland, You all suck and are jealous, blah blah&quot;, until finally they have fallen on their own saving grace - they knew he didn't kill it late Sunday, and so they can ask the server to watch for the next spawn, and somehow this proves he didn't do what they know he did.  Confessions and a GLs word SHOULD mean a lot towards becoming &quot;probable&quot; and not just &quot;possible'.<br>
<br>
Logs can be edited (pro or con), screenshots are impossible on something that happened with no one else in the zone. . .so what you're saying with this precedent, is that I can fuck with the RTA at will, and unless you all can prove I did something that I know damn well you can't prove - I get away with it?  That is a very slippery slope.<br>
<br>
I think we are looking at the wrong &quot;rotation spawn&quot; and should be looking for someone who might know if DN reset between the kill before ED's and the server crash.  Given that it's DN and so few go there - I doubt that will happen.  I guess our only recourse is let them get away with it and enjoy more threads like this in the future because unless you have proof, nothing can be done.  And proof in EQ is amazingly hard to come by.  This means when it's your turn for mobs in rarely trafficked zones, you best keep an extra vigilant eye out for them, lest they be sniped. <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net/images/ezboard/sig-small.gif&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Karadin Firethorne&lt;br&gt;Assassin of The Rathe&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noble-blade.net&quot;&gt;Noble Blade&lt;/a&gt; <br>

<br>
It pains me that there is no more proof to be had; I don't want to cast a vote in either direction due to the dates of Zland pops. I understand that there may have, or even likely could have been a zone crash or repop; I wonder if a zone repop would not put the zlandicar pop date on the 8th, or 9th from the 4th when it was originally posted; however again, I freely admit and also agree that the poster could have done it and posted days later. The unfortunate problem is, as has been stated, is that by virtue of a solo kill, no one else knows, and the doublespeak nature of the posts from the concerned party leads me to believe that no one would believe anything at this point, from the horses mouth or not. <br>
<br>
But it either did, or did not happen, so there must be a final decision reached. 'Maybe' is a luxury not afforded to anyone in a yes or no question.<br>
<br>
I do not deny that there is a good deal of material that is difficult and/or impossible to explain away sufficently to remove the probabilty of guilt in this situation, from where the post started, to the tone it began with, to the inexplicable changes that occured in it, and the reversal of the issue at the end. <br>
<br>
Because this resolution and deliberation could concievably go on until the decision is so retroactive as to be meaningless, I believe that the considered decision of the affected guilds on the Rotations should be respected, and while I do not remove my cautions, I do consider the debate closed in support of, or detraction from, the points I raised.<br>
<br>
Clan Bashemded supports the proposed suspension of SoY from the Zlandicar rotation, as per the precedence set with the King Tormax rotation. <br>
<br>
If, indeed, a mob was not taken, I do apologize to the members of SoY; the logical conclusion one reaches when reading the posts does point to a zlandicar killed. <br>
<br>
I can only say that the past bad experiences with members of your guild is, at least not consciously, entering into my decision on this matter, and I feel I would have made the same call had the guild been Frayed Knot, a guild that I have clearly stated that I respect and have had only positive encounters with. <br>
