<br>
    It has come to my attention that we will soon be loosing our raid leader Kellory. I know for the most part that most of you are sad to see this as well as I am. I've been on a few guild raids that were ran by him in the past and they were well orchestrated and to be so many guilds at once its amazing to see most everyone cooperate and make the raids successful. I'm not gonna beat around the bush about what I'm asking for but with the majority of approval from CoG raid attendees. I would like to take over where Kellory has left off. <br>
I dont expect anyone to be jumping for joy over this cause it is sad when we see someone leave as a leader because its so hard to deal with the patience it takes to get something such as a CoG raid organized. I do realize that its a task thats very huge and that the shoes I want to fill are indeed very big but I'm more than willing to at least try as best as I can. I do realize what Kellory is going through , I've went through the very same thing in other games such as Ultima Online and Mechwarrior 3. Now without futher adue , I would like to explain my creditials for why I believe I can handle the task that may lay before me. <br>
<br>
     Well when Ultima Online came out over 8 years ago I took to the first Massive Online Role Playing Game with a graphical interface. For the first year on the Cheasapeake Server , I basically did nothing but improve my skills as a newbie. Once I felt comfortable and made alot of friends in the game I was offered a spot in a guild called Midnight Guild. I stayed in Midnight Guild for over 6 months and we pretty much did about everything ya could in UO including dungeon raids where we went in and slaughetered whole dungeons full of people in a group of about 20 people at one time. We did this on a regular basis , at least 2 times a week. Midnight Guild's leader had to leave the game and a vte was cast as to who would form the new guild and it was unanamously in my favor so I formed a guild called Vengeance in Pride. We quickly resumed where we left off and grew even stronger with upwards of 35 members that played on a nightly basis. I ran ViP for over a year and a half and then after that I grew bored with the things we did over and over and Everquest had been out for amost 6 months at this time. I was a very determined UO player and one of the ones that at first refused to play any other MORPS's. <br>
<br>
     After about 2 months of sulking and wanting to get on a new kick so to speak. I heard of the game that hit the shelf called Mechwarrior 3. I was also very in tune to these type of simulation games from my previous involvement in Mechwarrior 2 before Ultima Online for 2 years in the network gaming service called Kali. I was very excited to recieve my copy of Mechwarrior 3 from Wal-Mart. I popped the game in and I was blown away by the graphics. I soon downloaded the MSN gaming zone software and established my name of Stud_Puppy_27. I played this nightly online and soon after it came out I started seeing clans form and I thought it might be cool to be in one so I did my scouting. I was fighting in a battle that was designated for Lasers only and my opponent was SJ_MotorNerve , the SJ stood for Smoke Jaguars . Keep in mind I was still on 56k connection and only connecting at 26.4. Motornerve was amazed at my lag shooting skills and I even blew him out of the air a couple times which really impressed him and he offered me a spot in his Unit Smoke Jaguars as the Kitmaster which is designated as the Head Trainer of the Clan. The next 6 months I spent training hard and training other SJ's and we eventually got into a New League called Battlezone. This is where all my training others paid off. In the first month we were in BZ we took 3rd place. Against 19 other units. From there for the next 6 months we worked hard at trying to take first but we never seemed to be able to get anymore than 2nd because we simply could'nt do the amount of battles in a month timespan that our main competitors Draconis Combine could. There was some trouble with Motornerve and his need to leave the game due to the fact that he was a lead designer for the new First person shooter coming out which at this time was Unreal Tournament. After so discussion it was decided that someone would take his place through a voting system. A vote was cast and once again it was unanamous that i would take the title as Khan of Smoke Jaguars. From here I decided that the ONLY way we were gonna take control of first place was to get more members and at the time we only had 45. I spent the next 2 months recruiting hard. at the end of the two months we had 120 members and everyone had a rank and a list of commanding officers just like in the military. Once we got everyone together and we decided to take first and not only take first but to set records. The first being the highest point total for a one month cycle and the second being the most battles in a month. In December , We did just that. We had over 1800000 points and over 900 battles in one month. The previos record being 1100000 points and 600 battles ruffly. At this time we were considered the best Clan not only by the other Units in the same League but also by all the other units in the other leagues. Keep in mind that the zone at this time would only allow 240 people in a game chat room at once and on any night there were over 60 Jaguars in our main room known as Clans. I stayed the Khan for over a year and a half and we remained the ones to beat. Of corse we lost alot of battles but we also won 3 to 4 times as many as we lost. Then I also grew tired of running the Clan and got bored with the game after the constant issuance of hacks by other players on MSN. What was I to do? Well I decided to try and break another record. The highest percentage of wins in a month. I left SJ and formed a unit called VETS ( Veteran Elite Terrorist Squad ) , Sorry if the word terrorist offends some of you , I dont approve of terrorism but this name came out long before the attacks on the US. Anyhow , I decided to recruit the Best of the Best players in the zone. I did'nt want numbers , I wanted Quality. I had 20 people that were indestructable almost. We stayed in BZ for one month to do what I wanted to do. We did it. 110 games and we lost 4 times. We obtained the highest win percentage and VETS was disbanded and they went back to the units the had before VETS. <br>
<br>
    Ok so now I had pretty much done everything I wanted to in Mechwarrior 3. Now it was time to move to another MORPG. I was at this time very interested in Everquest with what I had read and with the new addition of Ruins of Kunark I was going to get myself a copy and start kicking some ass. I loaded in the game and all the patches and started killing rats and snakes and beetles with my warrior Dakor. I played Dakor up to level 19. Soloing most of the way but as most of you know. Warrior cant solo much at all with only regular equipment which at this time for me was Dwarven Ringmail from killing Corflunk and Zarchoomi in BB. I got tired of the repetition and the downtime of resting before each kill and decided to make a new character. By this time I had heard that druids were some of the best soloers so I made a halfling druid named Mechy. This was the only name I could think of cause its the same thing all my friends called me in Mechwarrior 3 when I was SJ_Mechgod_27. I played and played and played. Soloing for probably 75 percent of my leveling up to level 59 for experience. <br>
 <br>
     Now some of you are probably wondering how someone that has soloed most of his career could organize a raid? Well 75 percent aint the whole 100 percent. I've been in a number of raids. Mostly with friends from Shadowed Fates and Sign of One. I have'nt been to alot of the places they have been but most of them. I dont know every plane or every zone really well but I have done enough research to know what needed to be successful as a raid in most of the zones. Zellex , as far as I know is probably one of the most imformative people in a raid I know and of corse whenever he can , I would utilize him for pulling and FDing with the occasional other monk following him around to see how to do it and learn just in case we dont have zellex on a raid. <br>
<br>
     As far as setting up groups and fees and times and locations for all this. Thats just something that will take time to get used to and I'm more than willing to take advise from Kellory as well as any other seasoned raiders and I'll apply it as best I can to our current situations. I dont expect things to go smoothly right off the bat but over time I look for things to improve and I would'nt mind at all if Kellory wanted to lead raids also in the planes from time to time. From my understanding he still wants to do some raids in the future and I would only see this as historical due to the fact that he would not be the normal raider and I would be more than happy to let him have the helm if he wanted it. <br>
<br>
     I have reviewed the rules of the raids in the past and I can honestly tell you that there is probably nothing at all I would change unless a certain set of circumstances came to light. I'm very helpful and I try to be extremely mindful towards everyones needs and wants. Ask any Circle of Mist member if I have helped Circle of Mist and I'll bet not ONE can say I have'nt helped them in some kinda way. <br>
<br>
<br>
     I know this has been a really long letter and for those of you who have read it. I commend you for doing so cause I know alot of it is babbling from me. I just wanted everyone to see my accomplishments if they had any doubt of me doing the job. Thanks alot for everyones time and if you would like to see me do this then please post that you are in acceptance of me taking over the task. <br>
<br>
<br>
    Thanks once again for everyones time and I look forward to seeing you all in Fear Saturday and on other raids in the future even if not many aggree with me doing the raids. I want this to be decided by CoG guilds and not something only selected by a handful of people. Please post something weather negative or positive. I'll try to respond to all comments. <br>

For myself, I remember that night in DN and lets just leave it at that.  I wont endorse your proposal, but then you dont really need my endorsement.  Just post and lead.  Time will tell. As long as your dont get everyone wiped out, people here will always follow the leader.  Success breds commitment. <br>
<br>
As for Zellex, you'll have to talk to him about that.  I've always had to talk to him before each raid to see if he was available and coordinate with him.  You cant just post here and expect he'll show up.  Of course, since he led that DN raid, I'm not sure what his reaction will be.  I imagine he'll help if he can tho.  CoG is bigger than our personal likes and dislikes.<br>

A chetari wardstaff dropped. All that could use it rolled and I won it. Shorty after this I got bombarded with tells from Leete telling me that I should give it up to someone that is gonna use it and I told her that I would use it but that it would also be used to get me alot of wisdom gear later on when I went to sell it. After all , even though I was gonna use it for a while , I was gonna use it also to get better wisdom gear later on cause I only started with 90 wisdom and at the time I only had 148 wisdom. I kept getting rather nasty tells from Leete about this over and over and it was extremely distressing to even enjoy the raid with someone constantly badgering you about and item while your trying to help with a raid. After dealing with the onslaught of tells for approximately 15 minutes I decided that it would be best for me to just leave and log. Which is what I did. Keep in mind that this was basically my very first raid and that I soloed alot so I was'nt really aware that druids are needed alot for raids after they are done for ports out. <br>
<br>
     I believe that I apologized to all parties invovled in the raid afterwards on several attempts and if I did'nt apologize to anyone there at the time then I apologize now. I honestly dont know what more to say about the matter other than it happened under circumstances that were very foreign to me and I really did'nt handle it quite like I should have but like I said , I was very nieve at raiding then and it was my very first raid. I made a mistake on gating out , that was my fault but I never got an apology from Leete. <br>
<br>
    Zellex , as far as I know is probably one of the most imformative people in a raid I know and of corse whenever he can , I would utilize him for pulling and FDing with the occasional other monk following him around to see how to do it and learn just in case we dont have zellex on a raid. <br>
<br>
    I'm not quite sure you read the whole thing bro but if you see there. I said that of corse whenever I could use him bro. I did'nt make it sound like I was commanding him to be there at every raid. I mean I can be very resouceful when I need to be and with the friends i have that are still wearing SF tags and alot of them in Paralax now I'm sure I can get something going when I need to for a raid. <br>
<br>
    It also seems as if things in the past are coming back to haunt me when the events happened at times when i was very young in the game and did'nt know much about raiding at all. If you have any doubts on wheather or not I've helped anyone. You can ask any CoM member and they will tell you I have helped CoM greatly. After all , I did solo 57 , Every little blue line in it outside rygor fort and I gave away at least about 12 to 20 FULL SETS of rygor armor to my guildmates and to others in the zone that were'nt even part of CoM. I would get a piece and TP to a ring near them and run to them and give it to them and then gate back to my bind outside the fort. <br>
<br>
     Ask Lexi if I gave her a blue diamond bracer for a res ( and this is not the first time I've done this ). I've been anything but harmful for the majority of my 110 days played on Mechy. I have had a couple instances that were considered not very honerable. They were both a very long time ago. I believe that DN raid you were reffering to was last year as a matter of fact. Then again , what person that has played this game has played it 100 percent correct and not been an ass to anyone for the whole time they have played? You find one person that has done that and show me proof and I'll give them 1kpp. Its just not possible. <br>
<br>
     At any rate this is just myself defending my honor at the moment and if anyone would like to say anything else. Please feel free to post about this. I will do my best to respond. Thanks Haemish , I'll get with ya bro on email if I see that most everyone aggrees to me doing this. If ya dont get an email bro. You will know why. Thanks for the responses so far , I look for to seeing more. Thanks CoG<br>

<br>
My previous post was my own personal opinion and beliefs.  Nothing more.  You cannot change what I feel about you Mechy.  Fortunatly you start with a clean slate with most everyone else.  To keep it clean I'm not going to elaborate more unless asked to.<br>
<br>
If you wish to run a raid then do so.  Set it up and run it.<br>
<br>
And it was merely my intent to inform you that Zellex would need to be asked before each raid.  That he doesnt just show up and hes not a CoG resource.  Special arrangements were almost always made for him.  Just bear that in mind.<br>
<br>
[EDIT] As for my liking or disliking anyone.  When I thought about it, I came to the conclusion it doesnt matter.  If I dont like someone its probably because of how they think or act.  But if the point of my stepping down (or one of them) is to encourage new ideas and new ways of thinking and doing things, then perhaps my not liking someone is a pretty good recommendation in and of itself.  I dont know. [EDIT]<br>

I mean when you say it like you said it. Your leaving yourself wide open for alot of questions to be asked by others and seeing as how it only affected you indirectly and you would not have the exact details of the incident I figured I would tell exactly what happened so that all could see it. I mean curiousity killed the cat. I just dont need 80 some people coming to me asking me what happened on the raid in DN over a year ago and I especially dont need them coming to a third party who did'nt see the tells I recieved from Leete to try to explain it for me either. <br>
<br>
    I just thought it was in poor taste to leave a cliffhanger like that in a messageboard for all to see and have questions in the back of they're mind as to my worthiness of becoming the raid leader for CoG raids. For the most part , if you were looking to tarnish my reputation as a valid member of a raid , I think you probably succeeded by the amount of views I have seen on this particular thread but then again , I aint gonna let this bother me. I'll get with Haem and set up a raid ASAP and we will see how many show up for it and it will be ran the same if not just as well as the ones in the past. I look for alot to show up but with something like this going on , who knows. <br>
<br>
    As far as Zellex , Like I said if he was around and wanted to , I would utilize him the best I could in a raid. I never said he had to do a thing , just saying if he WANTED to he would be more than welcome bro.<br>
<br>
    Thanks for your time CoG , I look forward to reading more on this thread. Hopefully some good post come to this =). I would like to see at least three people to post something positive on this thread other than Haemish and eqkommisar. Thanks all for reading this.<br>
<br>
<br>
  P.S. Also I forgot to mention that I will not make special arrangements for anyone in a raid. They will all be treated equally just like we are treated in the US.  <br>
