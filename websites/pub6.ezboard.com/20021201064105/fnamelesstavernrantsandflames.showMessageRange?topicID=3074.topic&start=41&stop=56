<br>
Those random research pages/words sell for 2-4pp each in KC.  They drop fairly commonly, are stackable, and don't weigh much.  And two or three bags should be enough to collect them all.  And gems do drop in KC.  I usually get 1 maybe 2 a night, and they sell for 50-80pp a piece.<br>
<br>
I have a cleric I play in KC.  If I used Naltron's on everyone in the group, I would probably loose money.  But as it is, I usually only natlron's the enchanter, MT, and sometimes the puller.  Everyone else gets pinzarn or nada.  But with symbol costs factored in, I still manage to net about 100-200pp a night if not more.<br>

<br>
1) I explained to group that cleric and chanter would split the gems, exceptions would be to give gems out to those needing them for quests.<br>
<br>
2) I kept any junk loot not claimed by the other members to sell as merchant fodder.<br>
<br>
3) I split platinum coins only as each member decided to leave group. Destroyed silver and copper.<br>
<br>
4) Even though I carried peridots on me I only buffed myself, the MA, and the enchanter with this and used Jasper on the others.<br>
<br>
5) I never rolled on items unless I had a twink that could use the item. At the time Packfulla was my twink, but I was playing a Ranger(main) and SK(twink).<br>
<br>
Now I do not consider my methods in KC as greed. I consider them as profit maximization. I leveled Packfulla from 40-52 in KC and during that time I made a total of 2500pp profit. That rate is not shit compared to buying a stack of peridots which on average cost 230pp.<br>
<br>
Don't never bash a cleric or enchanter and call them greedy until you personally play one and see that they are very expensive classes to play. In addition to buying gems there is the buying of spells which becomes rather expensive with the 50+ dropped spells. <br>

<br>
I currently play a 48sk, now i usually solo, infact have pretty much soloed, or on a rare occasion partnered with a shammy since i was about lvl 42, and before that 31-38.  In a group im often times either the puller, if no monky around, or the MT, because i jsut do quite a bit of dmg. Ive never had an instance of a cleric charging me for heals or buffs. Tanks and healers balance each other out. A cleric is pretty useless without a tank, however i am considered a tank, and i can usually fare jsut fine without a cleric. This is not to say that they dont help, i do like a nice heal once in a while. But the important thing is to show common courtesy. I dont charge ppl for my services as a tank, because my wpn cost like 20k, im not gonna charge 5pp per every hit i make, or pull a mob go FD, and then ask the cleric for a donation before i engage the mob. That would be a jackass thing to do. I mean money for tanks is a lot harder to come by then it is for porters or rezzers etc. What kind of services can i perform? Not many, nothing that will really turn a profit. <br>
<br>
But if you are broke and in a group, dont cast the good symbols anywho, conserve your ingredients. The buffs arent only for the tanks benefit, they benefit the cleric just as much, the more health, and ac the Tank has, the less often they need healing, and the more chance they have of surviving. You can charge for buffs in a group, its not a nice thing to do, but then again, a tank can charge for their services too, but chances are word will get around, and you will either be replaced, or people wont even want to group with you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unayanasoulspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nayana Soulspirit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>~no rez for you~</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#333333>(10/14/02 7:00:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3074.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.shaw.ca/kjdking/sigpic_12mini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: STOOPID CLERICS</span><hr size=1> umm  Arraegath you dont make a lot of sense.... does it cost you mana or gems each and every time you swing that blade.....   no  but it costs me 10pp each time i have to cast aego/symbol  and many times i loose pp cause the loot in the zone sucks i dont complain...  <br>

But point i was trying to get across is, in a group its a group effort. Its your job as the cleric to keep the members healed, and alive which ever way you can. Just like its the Tanks job to keep the mobs off you, and keep killin the mobs, as well as not train. No it doesnt cost me anything to hit, but it costs me quite a bit to hit harder. Just like it doesnt cost you much or anything for the crappy buffs, but to be more effective you gotta spend a lil extra. Its a collectiv effort is all im saying. Its wrong to charge your group members for a service that benefits you as well. If someone asks you for buffs, thats not in your group, its ok to ask for donation or what not, but within a group its not. Even if loot is bad for you, even though you are ML, think about the Tanks situation. They get little or no loot, and they cant rez people for money. Its a lot harder earning money as a tank, we cant port, rez, buff etc. So for the most part we rely on the loot from mobs. <br>
<br>
But back to the main point... Its just a jackass thing to do to charge group-members for such services. Now so far in my carrier i havent met a cleric that did this. Often times i will donate more than enough for buffs even when the person doesnt ask for it.<br>

 Like mentioned earlier, it's part of the class.  Melee spend the plat for equip and clerics spend the plat for dots.

I can understand the point of view youre coming from about not having any way to make money since you dont have a &quot;money maker&quot; like rezz, or clarity, or other buffs.<br>
<br>
I have never been a greedy cleric, I chose to play this class i knew what I was coming into as far as cost.  Sure some classes have it &quot;easier&quot; to make money with their abilties then others, you live with what u chose, good or bad.  <br>
<br>
I've always believed everything is a group effort.  Clerics die without a good tank, tanks die without a good cleric. This is true. But after hitting 50 and really starting to become a cleric  you really begin to understand why most people believe that  clerics ML gems and such to help in costs with dots etc.<br>
<br>
Example: Our 60 tank wants to hit  a high lvl zone (along with others) in hopes of good drops.  We have a group: 3 tanks, me, and other support classes.  Sure you need the tanks to succeed, you also need the cleric, no arguement.   I buy KEI 3-4 times over the night 100pp a pop to keep em coming (even after deaths), keep myself and 3 tanks symboled (if there was an enchanter Id symbol them too) , this is refreshed 3 or 4 times over 4 people in a few hours.  <br>
<br>
So thats what, around 500pp for a couple hours out of my pocket.  now imagine this over a long period of time, say hate, or any plane.  Or just a long day of exp grinding.  <br>
<br>
Is it &quot;fair&quot; that clerics should ML and get all the whatever loot to sell for &quot;profit&quot;?  Well thats dertimined by YOU, personal feeling whatever. Its just a common curteousy that has become a habit of most people to offset  expenses for the cleric.  <br>
<br>
Without  the cleric you may have a regen bp or a clickable heal off your 90k armor AFTER the fight, but nothing can replace a good healer DURING one. Who also needs good armor, good spells, and expensive gems to keep everyone alive.  Believe or not theres a balance.  Even with this generosity.<br>
<br>
Sure if you dont wanna share with your local cleric,  then they cant buy what they need to keep you alive.  <br>
<br>
Our tank says, &quot;A warrior is only as good as his cleric&quot;  Even though I believe the saying goes both ways, I also know all the armor on norrath/luclin can't keep you alive, but your cleric can.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If this werent true i wouldnt see the most shouts for &quot;Any clerics LFG?&quot;<br>
<br>
Clerics lose money everyday protecting the world.  Doesnt hurt to help them out  I sometimes make more then enough to cover costs, but more often  I lose money. We ALL lose money.  YES u need armor and weapons. to protect the cleric.  BUT Clerics need more then that to keep you alive. And they need a lot more, more often. <br>
<br>
But even through all of that, not all of us are greedy, cause we understand that it's hard for everyone to make ends meet sometimes, even in EQ. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have seen many different ways loot has been distributed, from a single group scenario of ML, to a Planes raid ML. <br>
Usually, the cleric is the ML in a single group, and will randomly split platinum and gold (as a member leaves or disbands), or one big split at the end of the group. Any merchant fodder is usually agreed to go to the cleric, to cover his reagent costs. Sometimes, the group would stick together as the cleric sold items and split the money received from the sale.  I even once was in a group in OS, where after the 3 hour killing spree, the cleric had all group mates &lt;/ran 100&gt; for items and gems. The extra/odd gem(s) was agreed upon as being rewarded to the cleric, to cover his expenses in reagent costs.  No argument/question.<br>
I have been on many Planes raids, where the raid leader/looter kept ALL gems/crowns/etc.  Also, I have been to Planes where the looter would distribute gems to all players present, either during short breaks or after raid. Never have I been to a Planes raid where money was awarded to groups, as the objective in those is mainly to obtain planar gear drops or exp.<br>
I must say that I have NEVER been in a group where the cleric (or chanter even) have charged for any buff, no matter what was entailed to cast it (reagent/mana/etc.).  However, when I play my SK, and I know that symbols are going to be important for the fight, and the zone/mobs don't offer much of an opportunity to reward us in cash/merchant fodder, I will offer the cleric money to purchase more reagents (or ask the group to chip in). Hell, had an LGuk group other night, where I gave the cleric 150PP in advance to purchase peridots that I knew he was going to use on my fat arse.<br>
I think someone said this before, but I'm just too lazy to go back thru the post.....If the cleric won't symbol w/out a donation, he better keep the group alive when they can't/won't cough up the cash.<br>
OK, I have used my allotted time here.<br>

Personally I never charge nor do I ever ask for donation.  <br>
<br>
If i get a tell about buffage from a non group/guild member I never even use my gem buff unless they have specifically asked, in which case they usually have already offered a few plat to cover cost.  <p>Cynadyne D'Luminos<br>

<br>
but look at it this way... what is the upkeep cost for a warrior....    you need no reagents....  no mana for any spells , (no kei needed) .  so all you really need for upkeep is port/rez/buff money .  Upkeep on melee's is pretty damn cheap.  <br>
<br>
Before I got Blessing of Aegolism, it was not uncommon for me to use 1-2 stacks of peridots a night  thats 210 a stack  out of my pocket and unless im doing OS  and getting gems im usually not making what i spend...  and dont talk about your warrior needing better gear... i woudl like better gear for my cleric too...<br>
<br>
with BoA i go through about half a stack to a full stack of peridots depending  on how things go but still not free.<br>
<br>
<br>
all this and having to put up with people who demand  a rez from me.  like the other day i was headed to UP for a raid and somone asked for a rez at the ME zoneline while i was getting invised for the run and had to get to the raid Asap...   when i said no the person got irate and started yelling at me...   hmm,  i said no when he asked  so what made him think that yellign at me would get him a rez either....  /shrug     stupid people <br>

I told him sorry Im in a hurry, late for a raid.  After he followed me through 3 zones I finally stopped, broke my invis, stopped my entire group, who broke their invis to fight off mobs, and he gave me 30cp ..yes copper pieces, and ran off.<br>
<br>
Its only times like these that get me angry, and people wonder why clerics or even enchanters, etc arent as willing to stop the world to help u out without saying PAY FIRST PLZ, as Im beginning to see more and more often. <p>Cynadyne D'Luminos<br>

Im an SK, and SK's do have upkeeps. We have self buffs, pets and debuffs. Now my stuff doesnt cost as much as cleric gems, but i do go through quite a few cats eye agates, and and such. Now about 3 or 4 stacks only cost about 100pp but the spell its used in is so that i dont take as much dmg thus saving cleric mana.<br>
<br>
The game is meant to be balanced. Everyone has their role. Yes clerics do have to spend money to keep their group alive, but they have benefits and perks, you'll rarely see an out of work cleric, where as its a lot, and i mean a LOT harder to find a group as an SK, or Ranger, Warr at times too. Because here are so many tanks out there, we cant find groups as often. And usually the tanks with better equip (not always) are wanted prefferably because  they can keep aggro better etc...<br>
<br>
So our money goes into being able to get group better etc.<br>
<br>
But im not doubting the importance of clerics. They are quite needed, and no disrespect to any clerics, i just think its wrong to charge your groupmembers for buffs. Even if you are kinda broke. If you cant afford the buffs then just tell them, usually they'll be kind enough to donate, but demanding payment is wrong. <p>Arraegath Bloodspill

<br>
with the changes to druids and shaman and their CH's i have noticed that  places like VL and OS clerics arent a must anymore so we ed up only being needed in CT and such....  which means there are more clerics LFG in CT....  i spent 4 hours on monday and 5 hours on tuesday  groupless  LFG going from place to place with no luck...  dont think that just because im a cleric i get groups all the time, you would be surprised.<br>
 <br>
and for those of you who think I can make a killing rezzing people think again.... people see my epic and expect free rezzes,  rez is NOT a moneymaking spell.  Not when you get a small donation every 6th or 7th rez...   if your lucky <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=160602 ><img src=http://members.shaw.ca/kjdking/sig9.JPG></a><br>

I suppose there are unfortunate people who cant afford rez, but i usually pay for rez, whether it be epic cleric or not, its happened to me quite often that they wont accept my donation, but i always donate about 80-100pp if i have that much, even if it is an epic cleric. <p>Arraegath Bloodspill
