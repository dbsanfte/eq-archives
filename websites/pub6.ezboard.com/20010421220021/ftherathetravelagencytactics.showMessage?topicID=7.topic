Not much I have to say in this one, Arafein covers all the basic's quite nicely.  Main issue is the same as fear, get a cleric camped out at SS.  If you have any questions let me know in the general section where I posed about these posts...<br>
*End edit*<br>
<br>
Insertion:<br>
<br>
Insertion into Hate can be done from any Wizard portal. The zone is only accessible by means of a level 49 wizard spell called Alter Plane: Hate, which uses a Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk for a reagent. These can be bought in the cleric guild in Neriak 3rd Gate by any dark elf or rogue, and cost approx. 250pp each. It's usually a good idea to buy 5-7 of these, and not unthinkable to buy 10 or 15 - any you don't use, you can save for your next raid. All your party members should meet at the wizard circle and form groups of 5, not six. You should have one solo wizard, and one lowbie character camped out with the hatestones on them. An alt works well for this. Upon arriving, give 1 hatestone to the wizard and the rest to the mule. If the mule is an alt, have the main character of the mule go up in the first group. Everyone should then buff up with Invis versus Undead, See invis, all HP buffs, and SoW. The wizard will join the first group and cast the gate spell. A useful tactic for getting everyone in unseen is to have the inviser begin casting Invis vs Undead on the wizard, then before the casting is complete, the wizard begins to cast Alter Plane: Hate. The invis takes effect before the gate finishes casting, and the inviser has time to reinvis his/herself. The first group should ALWAYS have at least 1 cleric, at least 1 monk, and at least 1 rogue.<br>
<br>
Here is the map of hateplane. I know it's huge, but that's just too bad.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/Plane_of_Hate.htm">everquest.allakhazam.com/...f_Hate.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Upon zoning in, you will find yourself in a little room, facing a wall. Your location on the map is the house designated 1. Upon zoning in, turn around 180 degrees and proceed forward about 5 steps, then turn right 90 degrees. You will see a doorway leading out of the building you are in. Go out it, then turn right 90 more degrees. You will see a large, sloping wall ahead of you - this is the eastern zone wall. Run up it as high as you can go. If at ANY point something attacks you STAND STILL AND DIE. It is absolutely VITAL you do not move from this area, because to the immediate north are rooms from which there can be no CR for as many as 8 hours because of the content of mobs. Once you have run as high up the eastern wall as you can (ducking helps you get even higher, but be careful - you don't want your head to pop out in the 2nd floor) turn right another 90 degrees and proceed south along the wall - stay as high up as you can. Proceed south until you run into the southeastern corner, at which point turn right another 90 degrees and proceed west along the south wall. As you go, keep a close eye ahead of you for any movement along the wall. Ghasts, Rats, and Liches will wander along the south wall between house 2 and the arches just before house S. If you see a mob ahead of you STOP and back up. These mobs WILL see invis, however the ghasts and rats will NOT see invis versus undead. The liches, on the other hand, WILL. If they hit you, stay high on the wall and die - your corpse is easily CR'd. If they do NOT see you, wait until they move on then proceed west along the south wall. Once you reach the southwest corner, make sure you stay as high on the wall as possible - there will be 3 mobs in the SW corner at all times. Upon reaching the SW corner, turn right again 90 degrees and proceed north along the west wall. When you come parallel to house Q, which is looks like a small gray/blue house with a door facing the west wall, STOP and camp high up on the wall. Do NOT go north of here, you will aggro mobs in the maestro area and possibly draw Innoruuk's attention, which guarantees you a fat DT. Then log onto an alt, unless you are the monk, the wizard, or the rogue. Monk should FD, and rogue should stay in camp hidden and sneaking for CR reasons. If the Wizard dies, the rogue should drag his/her corpse to camp and leave it there - the wizard will continue to gate up groups naked, although someone should hand him/her an item or some money before each gate to prevent corpse decay. If the wizard does NOT die, he/she should gate back to the wizard portal immediately after zoning in back to where the rest of the insertion party is waiting in order to port up the next group. IMPORTANT - if the wizard dies, his corpse must be drug BEFORE he ports the next group up. This is to prevent multiple corpses out of camp, which cannot be drug. Once everyone is in, and camped out at the West Wall camp, directly west of house Q and high up on the wall, the rogue can begin to drag the corpses of the slain to camp, where the cleric can rez them. <br>
<br>
The rogue's particular responsibilities are as follows: <br>
<br>
Rogues are very useful in Hate, because they are invisible to many of the mobs in the zone. However, Loathling Liches, Scorn Banshees, and Haunted Chests (sometimes) WILL see sneaking rogues and will make short work of them. Scorn banshees and Haunted chests, however, are static spawns, and thus do not wander around. Loathling liches are wanderers, and WILL wander around. When the rogue is dragging corpses from the point of death along the South wall, he/she should be very careful of the wandering liches that will path between houses U and 2. They proceed in a large circle around house C, moving both clockwise and counterclockwise, so the rogue must be very observant to time the South Wall Run while no Liches are within visual range. This is the only impediment to a rogue dragging any corpses along the insertion path to the west wall camp.<br>
<br>
Types of mobs in hate:<br>
<br>
There are three types of mobs in hateplane - Static mobs, wanderer mobs, and SW mobs. Static mobs spawn every 12 hours and have an approximate 15-25% chance to drop loot; Wanderer mobs spawn every 2 hours and have about a 3-5% chance to drop loot. SW mobs respawn every 30 minutes, and have a 0.1% chance to drop loot. Mobs here hit even harder than Fearplane mobs, topping out at 150-160 points of damage. They have about 8-11k hp as well, more or less unlimited mana, and they all hit at 10 delay. Of Importance to Enchanters, mobs come in 4 classes of Mezzability, as opposed to fearplane's 2 classes (Priority and Non-Priority). The four types of mez classes are:<br>
<br>
Priority 4 - Easy to mez. Not a problem.<br>
Priority 3 - Harder to mez, but not TOO hard.<br>
Priority 2 - Difficult to Mez, but not impossible. Take these out first, Unless you have a priority 1 mob in camp.<br>
Priority 1 - Absolutely Impossible to mez. THESE MUST DIE FIRST.<br>
<br>
Also, pay close attention to which mobs are undead, and to which mobs can fear. When pulling a mob that can fear, make sure to turn off Run and SoW.<br>
<br>
Clerics of Innoruuk - these are the mobs you will see most often. They look like 10 foot tall Dark Elf Dragoons with no weapons, and are neither undead nor summoned. All clerics of Innoruuk are static spawns EXCEPT for the 2 that spawn in SW corner - these are SW type mobs. They are basically a party's dream cleric - punch for 140ish, cast Heroism, Death Pact, Resist Magic, Retribution, Word Divine, and most annoyingly Greater heal, Superior heal, and the dreaded Complete Heal. Clerics of Innoruuk are very difficult to interrupt - stuns are critical when they reach 30% life or so. They are difficult to mez AND heal other mobs, so they are a priority 2 target. Dispelling them immediately upon pulling can help, because it will dispell their Heroism, AC buffs, and most importantly, their Resist Magic. They drop Cleric-Only Ethreal Mist Armor, as well as the Cleric-Only Prismatic Shield, which is visible when a cleric has one.<br>
<br>
Kiraikueis - These look like Giant Mummies, and are undead monks - they can punch for as high as 160 points of damage and can flying kick for 130+, and proc the wonderful Strong Disease buff. They also have higher AC than the other mobs. They are Priority 4 mobs, easy to mez, and they are all static spawns, except for 1 kira that spawns in Southwest Corner - it is a SW type spawn. These drop Warrior-Only Indicolite armor, as well as the Monk-Only Shuriken of the Tranquil.<br>
<br>
Scorn Banshees - These look like giant Festering Hags, much like Female FFs from Fear. They are undead, and do not cast any spells, but they are resistant to magic, so they are a priority 2 mob, technically harder than clerics to mez but not as threatening while free. They drop Bard-Only Imbrued Platemail Armor, as well as the Bard-Only Martune Rapier, which is visible when the banshee has one. Always static spawns. They see ALL forms of invis, including Rogue Sneak.<br>
<br>
***UPDATED*** After the recent patch, Scorn Banshees are now much more formidable. When a scorn banshee dies, it has a chance to randomly deathspawn (another mob spawning on top of its corpse at the instant of death) either another scorn banshee or a thought destroyer. This can result in chain-deathspawning mobs, so be warned. Thought Destroyers are new mobs that do not spawn normally, and can only be deathspawned out of Scorn Banshees. They are level 55+ and hit for over 220 a pop, are Priority 1 targets (Impossible to mez) and are very magic resistant. They drop the Tainted Steel Breastplate, which is obviously for a quest (Ac 5 wt 10.0 plate classes only). No information as to WHICH quest the breastplate is used for is available at this time.<br>
<br>
Haunted Chests - these look like giant evil treasure chests. Not undead, may be summoned. They cast a nasty AE dispell similar to the Tentacle Tormentors from fear, and see sneaking rogues. They run VERY slow and are thus difficult to pull. They are a Priority 2 target, very difficult to mez, and their AE dispell will dispell mezzes on other creatures. They drop random pieces of planar armor, much like the phobos in fear. Always static spawns. They can sometimes see ALL forms of invis, including rogue sneak, but do not appear to aggro on a rogue very easily.<br>
<br>
Spite Golems - big Rock Golems, look like stone guardians from Nektulos. Not undead, may be summoned. They are PRIORITY 1 mobs - 99.9% magic resist, which includes mez - they can only be hit by melee damage primarily, but some 50+ casters CAN land dots or difficult-to-resist spells, such as the Lure line. They are shamans, and cast drowsy in addition to hitting hard and proccing Daze with every hit. Dispell these the instant they walk into camp, because they will have lots of buffs on that will make them very nasty (including alacrity *shudder*). Also, when the Golem starts to run, it will cast Spirit of Cheetah on itself - VERY BAD. Dispell it! These drop Shaman-only Rune Etched Armor, Spite Stone Shields (Barbarian Shaman only, very rare) Runewood Shields (Druid only, Unbelievably rare) and are always static spawns.<br>
<br>
Abhorrents - These look like large Gargoyles are not undead (may be summoned), and are rogue mobs that backstab for 400+. Priority 4 target, you can mez them in your sleep. The drop the Rogue-Only Woven Shadow armor, as well as the Rogue-Only Shrieking Ahlspiess Dagger/Spear (no one's quite sure which it is), which is visible in the Garg's hand. These are always static spawns.<br>
<br>
Forsaken Revenants (Male) - These look like male vampires, and are undead Magician Mobs. They are casters and are therefore more resistant to mez, making them a priority 3 target. They are magicians, but do not have pets, which means they are limited to AE Rain spells and nasty DD spells. They don't hit often, they're too busy casting. They drop Magician-Only Apothic Armor, and are always static spawns.<br>
<br>
Forsaken Revenants (Female) - These look like female vampires, and are undead enchanter mobs. They do not charm, but they may mez, and they do fear. They are difficult to mez due to RM buffs, and are therefore a priority 3 target. They drop the Enchanter-Only Insidious Armor, and are always static spawns.<br>
<br>
Revultant Rats - These look like plague rats or diseased rats, and are undead. They run VERY VERY FAST and hit even faster for 130-140, and proc Deadly Poison upon the target. Everyone hates these mobs. Priority 4 target, very easy to mez. Rats occasionaly drop the Ranger-Only revultant whip, which is not visible, but you can tell if a rat has one because it will slash you instead of bite you. Rats are almost always Wanderer spawns - very irritating.<br>
<br>
Ire Ghasts - Giant ghouls, they have a nasty harmtouch and cast SK spells upon their targets, including fear. They are undead, and are a priority 4 mob, easy to mez. They are usually wanderer spawns, but some static ghasts do spawn. Ghasts drop the Paladin-only Darkmetal Holy Water Sprinkler (visible), the Paladin-only Theologian Claymore (also visible) and the Paladin-only Trueheart shield (not visible).<br>
<br>
Loathling Liches - Giant spectres. These are even more irritating than rats; they are wizard mobs, they see invis, they fear, they stun, they lifetap, they cast gravity flux, and drop nothing of value except a necromancer only wand with some charges of lifetap. They are undead, and are almost always wanderers. In addition to all this, they see past ALL forms of invis, including rogue sneak.<br>
<br>
Ashenbone Drakes - These look like smaller versions of Dracoliche from Fear. They are a PRIORITY 1 target, absolutely impossible to mez and 99% resistant to all magic, although they are vulnerable (slightly) to fire and undead spells. They cast SK spells, they harmtouch, they fear and they cast knockback, which is VERY BAD in this zone. Fight with your back to a wall. They drop The Warrior/SK/Ranger/Paladin Ashenbone Axe, the SK only Ashenbone Abbasi (one handed) and the SK only Ashenbone Shield. These are always static spawns.<br>
<br>
Maestro of Rancor - Innoruuk's Servant, master of building D. He is surrounded by 4 bodyguards, who are usually clerics or spite golems. Maestro is undead, and looks pretty unique - basically a tall blue guy that floats with a big red cape, affectionately known as Superman. He is a static spawn, and he hits for 205 points of damage (ouch!) and his most dangerous aspect is his uninterruptable AE lifetap. For this reason, fighting him is difficult - you want to keep as few people near him as possible, so the lifetap will not give him back much life, but not so few that they can't kill him. He drops the Bard-only mace Evensong, the bard only-sword the Six Note Blade, the Bard-Only Seven Stringed Lute, the Monk-Only mask Mempo of Likato, and the Erudite Paladin only Shield of the Stalwart Seas. His melee is EXTREMELY dangerous if he is dual wielding any 2 of the bard weapons he drops, as this means he will be QUADDING for 205 instead of doubling. In the words of Kalador Kane, 'Weapons don't matter....unless it's the maestro dual wielding Six Note Blade and Evensong. Then he Da Man.' An Important tactic to use when fighting maestro is to have someone with a very powerful dispell chain-cast it on him from the instant he comes into camp. Stripped of his buffs, he will spend a great deal of the fight trying to rebuff, giving you valuable time to beat him down.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk - the God of Hate. The Master of the Plane. Looks very unique, almost impossible to describe. Think old, bald, squinty elf-type dude, with mottled skin and blue hands that end in claws, and poofy renaissance clothes and a red velvet cape (it didn't look too clean to me). Unlike the Paranoid Cazic Thule, Innoruuk is difficult to aggro without getting in his face - unless a mob gets loose from camp and runs all the way up to the second floor to tattle on you, he'll generally ignore you. Also unlike Cazic, he won't chain aggro the entire zone on you when he does get pissed off - he'll just start DT'ing everyone. In addition, he might come to personally beat your ass. Be careful when running around the Northeast corner of the zone, as you'll be directly under him at that point, and he can and will DT you for invading his personal space. To kill Innoruuk, buff up like Cazic (Junk buffs, etc) but when you fight him, make sure to keep your back to a wall or he will Gflux you out into the city, and maybe back to the first floor, which is REALLY bad. Corpses in the Fountain (designated <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  are hard to retrieve. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He drops lots and lots of different items, too many to list here, but most prominent are the Monk-Only Rakusha Cloak, the Monk-Only Sode of Empowerment, the Warrior-Only halberd Sunderfury, the Shadowknight-Only 1H scythe Bloodmoon, the Druid-Only Tunarian Scimitar, and the Cleric-only Truesight Hammer.<br>
<br>
The particulars of Hateplane:<br>
<br>
Once everyone is in and buffed up, the pull team should pull house Q, which will usually consist of a Kira and a scorn. Watch out for the wandering Rat and Lich that will path between house Q and the west wall. House Q has two stories, which have 1 mob each. The mob on the first floor should be pulled outside the house, which should then be picked by the picker and brought to the camp high up on the wall. It is VERY important that mobs fought here should be pushed to the SOUTH while fighting - pushing them so much as 3 steps to the north will get your mobs Completely Healed by the clerics in building D. Also, be EXTREMELY careful not to barsh the mob up through the ceiling - this will get the mob stuck on the 2nd floor, whereupon it will begin SUMMONING your party members one by one onto the second floor, a location damn near impossible to CR from. Once the mob from the first floor is dead, everyone should move to the floor to the immediate west of building Q, and the monk should pull the 2nd mob from the upper floor of house Q to the camp. Again, remember to barsh the mobs SOUTH to avoid CHeals. Once house Q is clear, the monk should run under the arch to the southwest, and begin pulling houses R and S. The monk should FD directly west of the gap between houses R and S, but not so far south as to aggro the 3 mobs in the SW corner. Rogues are good for scouting the pulls in this area, but it's dangerous since there will be scorn banshees in houses R and S. Once Q, R, and S are clear, everyone in the party should charge the SW corner and slaughter the 3 mobs there. Assign one person to be the 'Timer' and start a 30 minute countdown the instant the first cleric dies. They will be in charge of warning the camp when SW corner is about to repop every 30 minutes. After SW corner is clear, Picker should stand at where the Corner of house S meets the south wall, and the monk should FD directly south of the gap between houses S and T. First, you should concentrate on the wanderers that are strolling along the perimeter of the south wall. If you have a very capable person with about 5 or 6 stopwatches, you can time when each type of wanderer dies to know when wanderers are clear. Rogues help a lot to do this. Also, all the wandering mobs except liches do NOT see thru anyone with Invis vs Undead cast on them, so capable paladins/clerics can also help with scouting wanderers. Everyone should, however, beware of liches. All wanderer tables are single-mob - in other words, 2 hours after you kill a rat, another rat will pop. Using this method, you should know when and where liches will pop, and can avoid them more easily. However, this is much easier said than done, and blindly killing wanderers until you don't see any more wanderers is sometimes preferable to attempting to skirt liches and accidentally training the camp.<br>
<br>
Once SW is clear and you've gotten some wanderers out of the way (You don't have to kill them all, just enough to clear yourself a window in which to pull statics) The monk can start pulling houses T, U, V, 2, 3, and both floors of House C (Warehouse). Remember to stop pulls and kill the SW repops every 30 minutes. Once all these areas are clear, the monk should pull houses A and B, then you should clear out ALL the wanderers on the south wander path. Then you should move your camp to house B - make sure everyone pays attention and does not get lost. Once everyone is set up in house B, the picker should station themselves directly north of house B, facing the alleyway between houses A and C. The monk should FD just north of the Door to house C, in good view of the picker. This places the picker in a precarious position - he/she will have to run all the way south to the door of house and inside house B, where the party will be waiting. This gives the mobs a good 2-3 seconds to beat on the picker unmolested, which is a good 600-900 damage per mob - and on a 3 mob pull, that can suck, especially if you get stunned. A good tactic around this is to have an enchanter cast Rampage on the picker before each pick, which will absorb some damage - and also, the pull group's cleric can stand outside the door of house B facing north and start casting a heal on the picker as the pull comes in. This is also a good spot to run forward and heal the puller if he gets poisoned or severly smacked. Be careful when pulling here, as the walls of house A and C will obscure line-of-sight for the picker's arrows, so the monk should try to run north a bit after bringing the mob home before FD'ing, thus placing the mob directly between the picker and the monk. A capable picker can also pull wanderers from the alleyway area directly to the west of his pick spot while the monk is busy. The monk should then pull any wanderers along the South wander path, then pull houses 7, 6, 5, and 4, in that order, as well as clearing areas 9 and 8 (ramp and fountain). Houses E, F, G, and H should then be pulled (you will have to periodically stop to kill wanderers every now and then), then the entrance areas to house D, the Maestro house. The mobs to the immediate north, east, and west of the door should go first, followed by all the mobs in the southwest quadrant of house D. You should then have a relatively clear area of house D stretching from the entrance to the corner directly west of the entrance. Clear any mobs that might aggro on people running thru this area, as well as all the wanderers on the north path, then move the party from house B to the western corner of the southwestern part of house D, directly south of house P. Make sure you caution everyone not to go near the throne which is situated to the south of this spot - you will aggro mobs in houses Q and P, as well as wanderers that path near both houses. Once the party has been moved to the western corner of house D, you can begin pulling the north areas of D, as well as the second floor. Once all of the second floor of D is clear, pull all of the north area of house D until only maestro and his 4 guards are left. A skillful monk should then pull Maestro away from his guards to the eastern area of house D, then let the guards head back to the organ area. Once maestro has been isolated from his guards, he can be brought to camp to be killed, then his guards can be pulled also. After those areas, then the banshees in house P can be pulled, then houses N, J, M, O, L, K, and I can be pulled. Alternatively, you can get houses N, J, M, O, L, and K while still at the house B camp by having the monk run up the east wall, run down to aggro the desired house, then run back up the east wall and lead the mobs south along it until reaching the arch between houses 5 and 6, and pulling the mobs west through that to the pick area directly east of house A. You'll probably have to pull more wanderers several times during this. Once these areas are cleared, the first floor should be clear of static spawns. The puller should then run up the Spiral Ramp (designated 9) and start to pull the second floor down. There are almost always 2 Ashenbone Drakes at the top of the ramp. Be careful pulling them down - you don't want to get knockbacked to the NE area, you might get a DT, and you'll almost certainly aggro something you'd rather not piss off just yet. There are really only 3 houses on Floor 2, a smaller house to the east of the ramp area, another small house to the south, and the large house to the north, directly above house D. This is Innoruuk's house. If Innoruuk is not up, the mobs in his house can be pulled down the ramp and brought to the camp in the western corner of house D, the same area you pulled all the other mobs to. If Innoruuk IS up, the game changes a bit. A rogue is useful here, because Innoruuk does not see sneak, and the rogue can report Innoruuk's movements to the puller. Inny wanders around the front, back, and middle of his house, which is shaped like a big sideways H. The pull team should wait until Innoruuk is wandering around in the back area AND facing east, away from the front of the house, then the monk can sneak behind him (use of sneak is important) to pull the mobs in the southern half of the house down the ramp to the pull group. Be careful, because sometimes Inny will turn around and catch you pulling his stuff, and then it's 'GOTCHA!' DT puller, rogue has to drag puller down the ramp to camp for rez, and start all over. Be careful of any scorn banshees in Inny's house, because they will see the rogue. Once the southern half of Inny's house is cleared, the wanderers from north path should be completely cleared, then the camp moved up the ramp to the little ledge just north of the ramp, directly east of Inny's house. BE CAREFUL. There appear to be certain areas where Inny can see you while you are sitting a goodly distance away from his house - it's ugly when he comes out onto the ledge to say hello. Then the rogue should wait until Inny is wandering the southern area, then he can be charged and killed in the southern area of his house. After he is dead, the puller can finish pulling the mobs in the Northern area of Inny's house, at which point the plane is cleared. Important: Unlike Fear, there is no 'Portal' out of hateplane, nor can anyone bind there. Everyone must be group gated out that cannot Gate themselves, and if you're low on evacers, a good tactic is the following: Have the rogue or monk duel an evacer, and have the cleric rez/revive them immediately. Then they can TP out a group, get revived again, then they should loot their items and make another duel corpse to teleport out the next group. Repeat as many times as necessary, but make sure you make a new corpse before each teleport, to prevent the ten minute rez limit running out. Congratulations! You've cleared the Plane of Hate.<br>

PS - Props to Darin Darkoak and Karadin Firethorne, who taught me most of this stuff, to Nicolai Ironcross, who outlined how to pull Innoruuk's area, and to Suhta (Supamonk!) who pointed out most of my mistakes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
