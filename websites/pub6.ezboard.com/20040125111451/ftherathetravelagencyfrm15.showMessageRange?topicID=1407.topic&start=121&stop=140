You guys just stuck your foot in your own mouths.  AiF is, indeed, on the Sev rotation.  If we want to take this further, any member of C4 could have been awarded the scale.  So therefore, any member of this alliance that is in another guild could have recieved the scale.  All 3-4 guilds that make up this c4 could therefore be penalized.  Yes?<br>
<br>

Of course they responded that they killed him.....they were caught.  Someone else had informed me that you guys were killing Sev right as we were porting in.  You guys were still there waiting to rez your dead when we zoned in.  What were you going to do?

Wanna know why? Because we have followed Rathe Etiquette and we earned that damn right.  Just like BoTS earned their right to take Trak and kill him.  We have busted our asses to get our guild where we are. That is why we are on Sev Rot. I watched how Warrik took VoLS from a small guild to killing things in Kael etc.. then Faylana took over and has helped make it what it is today and we are all damned proud of it.   <br>
Apone has been waiting for so long for that one piece and he deserved to get it.  He was excited all week because he would be getting the green scale he needed to complete his epic.  Congrats on not only putting one of our warriors behind on an epic piece but to all the guild's on that rot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mareenadeviant>Mareena Deviant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/10/03 2:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Dumbasses</span><hr size=1> You ask us to respect your right to gank whatever mobs you like because you've found a so-called loophole in the rot system? <br>
<br>
<br>
Fine. Then you respect our right to be on whatever rot we damn well choose. It's none of your business what gear our guildies do or do not have. NONE WHATSOEVER! What the hell were you doing checking our magelos anyway?  Huh?  What, Sesame Street was already over and the Teletubbies hadn't started yet so you had a bit of time to spare?<br>
<br>
I really can't make this any clearer to you... your opinion of our guild is as valuable to us as a fart in a bottle.  Probably less so if the truth be told... at least a fart in a bottle would have some minor impact should it be released.<br>
<br>
Now, my second point - I don't give a FLYING FUCK what you think about one of our warriors wanting to complete his epic. That is his right, and VoLS supports him on it.  We can assure you that whether he be tank number one or tank number three thousand four hundred and twenty three, he is a valued member of the guild. If he chooses to carry fine steel, then so be it.  It's his toon. So again, thank you for your opinion, now fuck off.<br>
<br>
Thirdly... and this is the important one, all personal mother insults aside, your total lack of respect for the systems put into place on the RTA, your glee at having side-stepped conventions and your childish slamming of those who choose to participate in the guild and RTA rot system are astounding.<br>
<br>
Don't be in a guild if you don't want to be.. that is your right. But don't think your decision allows you to do whatever you feel like to the detriment of up and coming guilds as well as established ones.  <br>
<br>
Why is VoLS on the Sev rot? Not that it's ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS but we're on it because we earned our right to be there by following the rules.  We didn't pull our guild out of some greater being's arsehole and plonk it at its current status, we worked long and hard to get it where it is today and continue to work hard in the hope that it will continue to grow and progress.<br>
<br>
I don't care what guilds you used to be in, or what you and your family do in your spare time, but I sincerely hope the RTA sends you a big message on this. The act was &quot;classless&quot; enough, the boasting and bullshit here is way over the top.  <br>
<br>
Sell the scale, destroy it, use it a sex aid for all I care... we'll get the scale for our warrior some day.  I apologise to him that it wasn't this day, the day it should have been.<br>
<br>
And one final note... thanks for the comments on our guild's &quot;uber&quot;-ness.  As stated before, your opinion is valuble... NOT!<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

Actually by your actions today you have proven the opposite.<br>
<br>
You're  &quot;friends&quot; posted quite clearly that they used unguilded alts so they wouldnt be caught. They also posted quite clearly that they did it so they could sell it.<br>
<br>
Apone to my knowledge was being awarded the scale to complete his epic so oyu did take it away not only from a warrior who deserved it but also PAYS the same amount of money as you and  at least has the INTEGRITY you and your &quot;friends&quot; seem to lack to wait his turn so that other warriors who deserve their shot get it also.<br>
<br>
Some idiot posted about the Rathe being the only one with these stupid Rot Rules. Easy if you dont lke them go to another server. Some idiot also posted that epics mean nothing, well I just got mine after 2 years and I  had better but heck it means a lot to me and if the warrior epic is so damn useless why did oyu people kill him to sell it for so much. No one would pay that much for such a gimp item obviously.<br>
<br>
You keep saying it was VoLS you did it to, you make it seem like this was an intentional attack on VoLS but oyu also hurt many other more deserving guilds and warriors out there who pay their money also.<br>
<br>
So oyu see you are wrong yu  have proven 99% of the server population is better than you and your &quot;friends&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'd be just as happy to see all rotations disappear.  I couldn't give a fuck less, really.  But while they are still here, and you want to *purposefully* violate everything everyone else on the Rathe has agreed to, then you better be damn well ready for what comes your way.    Assholes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, and as for you, Bugran.  I don't know what kind of retardation you are spewing into the gene pool, but for fuck sakes, learn to think. <br>
<br>
First of all, your &quot;I pay the same to play&quot; argument has been heard a thousand times.  Each time it is met with the same counter argument.  I pay the exact same fucking price as you do, you are no better than me, and deserve no rights to screw over every single guild in that rotation.   <br>
<br>
Oh, and I do have a right to kill stuff you can't, because I am in a &quot;ubber&quot; guild.  <br>
<br>
Would you like to know why?  Yes?  Okay, I will tell you!  I play this game to kill shit, so do my guildmates.  The main reason is to have fun, but fuck if we want to own anything and everything.  I am willing to bet I put more into this game than you do.  <br>
<br>
Your 14 fucking dollars doesn't compare to the man hours we put into stuff.  We work hard to be where we are, and you don't.  Thats fine, you play how you want to play, but don't bring the &quot;I want to kill stuff, I pay the same, too, no fair&quot; bullshit argument here.  <br>
<br>
We can't kill Rallos, or The Rathe Council .. Because we have not worked hard enough to get there just yet.  BotS and the rest of them have worked hard to get there.  They deserve to be there, and kill there.  We don't.  Yet.   Thats how the fucking game works.  Live with it, dickhead<br>
<br>
Sure insult away at my 'no life' what have you.  Like I give a fuck.  I'd be willing to put money on the fact that my life experience far out weighs yours.  I'd also be willing to put money on the fact that you are probably twice my age.<br>
<br>
Your &quot;I'm a pally at heart, and I went to their aid&quot; Bullshit is just as retarded.  Sure roleplay away, fuckstick.  Just remember, the rest of us could care less about your roleplaying retardation.  I have no problem with roleplaying .. but for fucks sake, don't use it as an excuse to be an idiot of this Magnitude. <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and a real pally would have not had joined the two groups breaking a rule and causing hundreds of people the pain of dealing with you idiots.   Hundreds of people, through out multiple guilds &gt; two greedy groups.   Better freshen up on your roleplaying some, there.<br>

Second of all.  Who the fuck are YOU to tell us what WE need?  Last I checked, your name wasn't on our roster.  You get petty, outdated information from our website, and assume we don't need it?  Riiight.<br>

Call us greedy all you want.  We are not the ones claiming to &quot;Gank&quot; the mob, when its up.  We are staying in line, and doing what the rules that the server as set up.  You are finding loopholes, and raping them.   I'd be willing they are the only kind of holes most of you will ever see.  <br>

So... you wanna have your cake and eat it too?  Oh I think you are about to eat all that you boys can handle.  I have a feeling it will be pie though, humble pie.  <br>
<br>
You form an entity (on a server full of entities which all abide by the same rules of engagement) and think that by not making your group a formal one you will be able to slip through the cracks and not pay consequences for your actions?  Think again!  <br>
<br>
You and all your friends who are bitter because your wonder guild just did an impression of the &quot;big bang&quot; need to check yourselves real quickly.   Funny that you should accuse the one who busted you ganking VoLS mob of being bitter.  Your hatred and idiocy are about to earn you what you truely deserve.  <br>
<br>
See you have a small group of like minded individuals who took it upon themselves to go out of your way to put me and my large group of individuals yet further back in our progression.  <br>
<br>
You stole from me and my family.  We will not forget.  <br>
<br>
Furthermore, my family has many friends who will also not forget.  <br>
<br>
I personally will not rest until each of you who were there has apologized to our warrior Apone for stealing something from him which he DID WELL DESERVE!  Either that or leave the server so none of us will be bothered by your worthless asses again.<br>

The server has become very complacent. <br>
<br>
The guilds are used to polite behaviour and the members of RTA guilds observing the rules, no matter what alt they are on.<br>
<br>
Obviously AiF and the C4 group has shown we can expect ganking a mob as normal behaviour now.<br>
<br>
Pardon us, if we make sure that doesn't happen again. The rot guilds do not have to take their time and plan their rot raids. And obviously we cannot do that anymore. I am sure the next guild up for Sev, or any other rot will be there quickly when it spawns.<br>
<br>
I for one do not support your alt alliance for posting status.<br>
<br>
Now go back to whining about how you can't get anything from greedy guilds.<br>

Oh for christ sakes... get off the drama box and step the fuck into reality.  This type of holier-than-thou-bandwagoning-infintile-bullshit really gets boring.  If you want to be a drama queen... please go and do it out in the middle of the freeway during high speed traffic and wear a sign that reads &quot;I am a drama queen, please run me over... again and again.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am sure there will be some backlash.  However, knowing the people of C4D (at least the core folks)  I am sure that once the people behind the toons actually take the time to chat on-line (i.e. in game) about this, it will all blow over.  <br>
<br>
For those few who will work this for all the drama it is worth... grow the fuck up.  Give your mommy your account info, have her cancel your account, and go finish growing up... then get a job, buy your own account, and then come bitch like you have a something of worth to add.  Until that time let those involved directly, handle the situation.<br>
<br>
This is NOT the first time this shit has happened.<br>
<br>
This will NOT be the LAST time this type of shit happens.<br>
<br>
Grow up, move on, get over it, have fun.   <br>
