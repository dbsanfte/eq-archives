<font size=2>An Alliance is...."in interguild relations, a formal agreement between two or more guilds for mutual support in case of war. An alliance provides for combined action on the part of two or more independent states and is usually defensive in form, since it obligates allies to join forces if one or more of them is attacked by another guild. Alliances are typically defined by a treaty, the most critical clauses of which are those that define the casus foederis, or the circumstances under which an ally becomes obligated to aid a fellow ally..." The Council of Guilds is not an alliance. Basta.</font>

<br>
I would however like to say I was one of these dinks that did not bind in the antechamber... it was my first raid and I was a bit overwhelmed. I also did not hear anyone say run in and die to gain mana... I saw it after the fact while I was in freeport thinking how dumb it was that I didn't bind.<br>
<br>
I would however like to mention the biggest part of the raid for me personally was the FG Psycho pull... I think it got out of control when the FG wizard cast gravity flux and we all ended up on the celing :) When the clerics started camping I was completely ready to die for the cause, but I was really determined not to let anyone else in my group die. Sinian was so close I didn't see any yellow when I started to heal him ... Whew he lived... not one of my group died... I turned to my friend here at work after the fight and let out a big HOLY $ <p><A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=9288">Tildar Treewalker</A> <BR>

That just shows that if peoples didn't bind in antechanber and die to gain mana back it was not, for all of them, cause of their lack of brain.<br>
 Some of them then didn't do it cause no oen told them to do, or not loud enough, or they didn&quot;'tpay attention at this time.<br>
 That jsut means that for next raid everyoen will know it now and at least all of those I talk about, those who did a little mistake, wil ldo it. But the real dumbs who will keep doing what they think being the best well... For Naggy if I remember well we would have needed jsut one or two nukers to go back in and nuke. So I m deeply sure it will work way better next time.<br>

After the fourth time I was summoned in that FG mess I was sure I was about to die. But like a good bard I decided to hide in the corner and shut the hell up so I could be found and healed. Good thing I did, it allowed me to be summoned three more times before we killed that wizard. His efforts on that raid proved to me once more to trust a druid over a cleric when you need a healer.<br>
<br>
 As for the rest of the group, we were a wonderful team. I bet we could've taken on any spawn in Lguk as is. Which brings me to my criticism of the raid, I saw a lot of individual groups. I did not see anything resembling two groups to form a whole. We can chalk this up to people not listening to the raid commanders, to be honest I never knew Lag was a woman, but I'd rather chalk that mark against the leaders themselves.<br>
<br>
 It is true that people will chose their leaders and place faith in those that have proven themselves. So this raid started with that mark against Lag and her inexperience with leading something of this magnitude. We entered this raid with fewer then was expected. I think rather then sticking to the plan layed before us, we should've seen a bit more ingenuitey and restructuring as to the tools we had. The raid was beautifully planned if we had the resources for that plan it would've worked. We had plenty of tanks IMHO to take out naggy. the problem was the healers could not keep up with the wounded and were oom. So what would you have us do but loiter around waiting for them to get mana. It is my expierence that battles are decided by the tanks. The longer they can keep naggy away from the nukes for the final push the better.<br>
 <br>
 We had something on this raid that I know is unheard of, more then 5 bards. With this many bard staying with the few tanks we did have turns the last few into nothing more then fancy meleer's with drums. I think it would've been in the raid's interest to set a bard or two on the tirage line to keep the healers mana happy and thereby keeping the few tanks alive.<br>
<br>
 As for the nukes, well I can not speak for them as I was busy trying to keep my tanks buffed and my healer full. I will say that there didn't seem to be enough of them and they were called in way to early. It could seem that way because some of our nukes were a one time use, if by their own design or by accident. Needless I knew the nukes had been called in too soon when the command was shouted and I held my own nuke till he was at 20%.<br>
<br>
 Another thing I noticed were the commands themselves in the heat of the battle. They were shouted mabey once at a time and were in no format at which you could read them. This lead to a sickening feeling that the leaders had panic'd. Despite this I pushed on. After playing a bard for so long I've really learned to read the way a battle swings and how to play my part as to save as many as possable. I do not believe Lag has fully learned the part of a raid master, and can only pray she learned from her own mistakes she made on this raid. I will be there for Vox, against my better reasoning, mostly to see if the leaders have learned to adapt to what comes their way. To be honest it sickens me that they HAVE NOT accepted any of the failure of this raid on their own part.<br>

&quot;Tis easy to blame others, but do you not find the fault within yourself?&quot;<br>

<br>
Paragraph by paragraph - <br>
<br>
The wizard for an extended period was Yurian's pet (a friend of Mine lvl 59 Enchanter) and she had it attacking the other giants. I am assuming you were pounded on by it either in the beginning of the fight or after it was the target. There were 2 healers pretty much in every group and they should have had almost no trouble keeping up with the heal load though yes I did call for clerics to camp as soon as I realized how many were in the room. Some of them blatantly disregarded that order but thankfully most left anyway.<br>
<br>
I can only work with people that are willing to work with others. From my vantage before I died many were using the assist command, though the giants were running around and people were finding it hard to follow 1 target at a time. The idividual groups I felt were strong enough to kill them almost unaided and since Yurian had been debuffing and slowing them I believe that gave eveyone a dicisive advantage. If people dont understand what the /assist Kommisar command meant then what are they doing at high lvl? Were they powerlvled and are now high lvl newbies? If so I dont want them. It's not a criticism against the person, it is the strong belief that they havn't spent enough time learning their char to properly apply themselves and until they get more exp I will not risk my raid with their lack of knowledge.<br>
<br>
I am far from new to running raids, I am simply new to running CoG's raids. MANY of you have seen me at every plane and dragon run done since SB reopened dragon runs and some of you will remember me going on dragon raids before half of you were lvl 20. Why dont I lvl? Because I promised my GL I would get him a white dragon scale for his epic weapon and I'm not going to break my promise. Now granted the people I was hoping to see didn't all show and since CoG has an incredibly large turnover rate we did not have many with dragon exp so THAT is what made our job hardest. I dont know about the rest of you and even Flarren agrees with me, alot of &quot;tank classes&quot; simply cannot keep up like a warrior does in combat. They dont have the life, AC or skills (dual wield etc) to keep up like warriors do, and so warriors make or break the raid. We had 5 warriors. <br>
<br>
Now let me explain to you why it is completely pointless to put a bard on triage line. FIRST of all if a healer is OOM they dont sit on their ass medding, they get in there and die, BOOM fm. And then they start healing again. SECOND If we were to leave a bard on triage there is a max of 2 healers that would benefit and all the xtra dmg that bard could do would be lost. Waste of time, not happening, healers die to get mana or I find healers that will.<br>
<br>
Now for nukers. My strategy was to send them in at 45%, how DARE you defy my command and tell whoever the nuker was to wait. (odd side note - with your group leader being Flarren [my rl husband] and you having Madkat, Aeval, Tildar and Bainzeal in your group who exactly were you telling to wait since you were in a tank group, not a caster group?) Maybe if he/she had been in from the beginning we might have done that extra 1000 dmg and pushed him into run mode. When I call nukers in I mean nukers in NOW. We had lost sufficient tanks by that point that caster deaths instead of tank deaths was an acceptable loss and needed in order to give the tanks time to run for a heal while Naggy was distracted. Everyone gets a rez anyway so there should be no reason to complain.<br>
<br>
I admit yes I should have repeated commands more than I did. Not everyone stops to read the red on their screen and next time I will be spamming the zone so you guys can read it clearly. I had not pannicked and never did. As I stated above I am FAR from being an inexperienced raid commander BUT I am used to working with a crowd that listens for their own good. My orders were never questioned before when I called them, they were simply done so why should they be questioned now? Afterall, whoever it happens to be - your raid leader is your raid leader. No one else. I've been playing since just barely after beta so I'm not exactly stupid as to the ways of battle either and from my standpoint things were going well until suddely everyone stopped with no command called to do so. If you had to force yourself to sign your name onto the Vox list then go take it off. If you have that little faith then you are one of the people I dont need.<br>
<br>
If I hadn't accepted responsibility for what happened would I have been sitting here balling my eyes out while Flarren tried to get things back together from my comp? Would I have been questioning every move I made all night if I didn't realize what could have been done differently? Could I honestly NOT believe it was all my fault? And if I had taken absolutely no responsibility for it as you say, would I have said in shout speech..<br>
<br>
/shout I dont know what to say guys. I am taking full responibility for us failing and I appologize to you all profusely for it going all wrong. I just dunno what to say or how to say sorry to you all enough =(<br>
<br>
*cut from original recap post*<br>
**************************<br>
-I believe I made 2 colossal mistakes (not counting the small ones too) thoughout the raid. In group movements to get inside I didn't take enough time to get my team aquainted with the system I wanted to use. That will be corrected. And mistake number 2 is not as easy to admit but *gulp* in the last final seconds before making our first rush I failed to notice a couple of my group leaders saying they were still missing their healer. Obviously hesitant they stopped (which they shouldn't have done anyway but I understood why they did) and everything back clogged in the first 20 seconds. <br>
<br>
-I cant place into words how sorry I am for not doing these parts better. Especially the Attack command. For this I appologize profusely and beg everyone to remember it was my first time leading a dragon raid and that now I have learned ALOT from what I did wrong.<br>
**************************<br>
<br>
Maybe if you'd had your ears open you would have heard that too. Now you had valid points and you had opinions and I believe I responed to all your suggestions with my reasons why it was, can, can't or wasn't done that way. I feel your post was a direct attack on me at some points and it was NOT called for. If you can do a better job then I welcome you to go try sometime. It is NOT as all fired easy as you think it is.<br>

Wow Sinian, I'm completely shocked at how you made such outrageously wrong claims, and were so cruel to somebody who spent days getting ready to allow you this opportunity, and all you can do is say BS to their face, well I for one will not put up with this!<br>
<br>
#1. &quot;I will be there for Vox, against my better reasoning, mostly to see if the leaders have learned to adapt to what comes their way. To be honest it sickens me that they HAVE NOT accepted any of the failure of this raid on their own part.&quot;<br>
~~Alright, this is a completely unacceptable remark, &quot;against my better reasoning&quot;, thats disrespectful, and I guarantee you its now against the raid leader's &quot;better reasoning&quot; to ever let you on a CoG raid, and anybody from any other guilds who may read this, for this horrible display of feelings. Oh ya, and I guess you know everything about nagafen raids and Lag and Flar don't, and I'm guessing that the FG pull to the throne was common too, and they didn't react well and we didn't kill all of them...alright, now /sarcasm off. Final thing for this reply, they HAVE NOT accepted...yadayadaBS! Have you read any of the posts Lag put? she said that she was sooo upset and blamed herself completely that she couldn't bare to check recap posts for a couple days. We had a couple problems, and many, no, most weren't her fault.<br>
<br>
#2. &quot;...and they were called in way to early...Needless I knew the nukes had been called in too soon when the command was shouted and I held my own nuke till he was at 20%.&quot;<br>
~~ Alright, this is another comment that really disappoints me, you think you know everything don't you? Ya, I'm not running this raid, but I think it would be better if I waited to nuke so the tanks have more time to miraculously hang on for 5 minutes of abuse, and nuking to finish him off faster would only hurt the tanks' chances of staying alive. I mean come on, use common sense, I guess u haven't been on one of these before b/c thats completely LUDICROUS to disregard what the raid leader says, they are law, and u a peasent of the 1200s (ya, I just finished Fuedalism in school, and btw, if u make fun of me for my age, I'm sure everyone will agree that its only b/c u r just trying to find a factor to make me look worse for laying into you like you deserve, so leave that aside, thanks). Also, on raids, casters generally go in at 60-70% hp, not 20%, the complete opposite of 20%. Lag said shes probably gonna change this, b/c Haemish used the 60-70% rule, and guess what, he has 5 dragon heads on his walls from leading successful raids, so I&quot;m personally gonna side with him thanks very much.<br>
<br>
#3. Alright, about the bards in a healer group, here u do have some basis, some guilds/alliances use this style, however, its alot easier and faster for all concerned to die, which is what the vast majority of successful alliances/guilds do for these dragons. When you consider that healers generally are oom after the first rush, maybe about to 20% mana, well, they heal, not sure, healers let me know, but this seems very logical generally once every 6-8 seconds, possibly more, so medding between heals won't do a whole lot, which is why Lag said this is how its going to be and thats how it was.<br>
<br>
#4. This is my final topic, this one concerns raid discipline. Now, this time I&quot;m not taling about the run to the back of the lair discipline, that was a problem, but I'm talking about the unfaithful, selfish, undevoted, I won't listen to my leader b/c I know more than them discipline. To take it into your own hands and decide what you want to do and what not is completely unacceptable, and it is not allowed, and an insult to all of us out there who go out there and work our butts off. Now, you wanna talk about me? I kept going over and over, but u know what? dieing doesn't matter, u get rezed, no biggie, I was willing to do whatever it took to make this raid a success, and you know why we failed? b/c people thought that rules don't apply to them, and that they are too good and can do what they wish, u know what? this makes me SICK! You are no better than anyone else. Also, I&quot;m sure this post is pretty close to what lag and flar are thinking, I&quot;m not saying it is, but I&quot;m sure I are reading this nodding their heads, but b/c of their position, they can't make a post like this one, well, guess what, I CAN and WILL, because I'm completely disappointed in your conduct. You belittled and ridiculed Lagdalen's abilities, and she went out there and did this for you, and thats that thanks? Please, don't bother wasting the space on any more raids b/c I for one don't want to listen to you blame Lag and Flar, b/c we all see now who to really blame. I personally would rather see a person who had never done it before, u know why? they don't want to mess up, so they will do exactly as told, b/c they want to see the corpse of Lord Nagafen lying breathless on the ground more than anything, I know I did my first time, and I still do. Unfortunetly, some people just are too good to listen to instructions, huh? This is rediculous, and I feel I probably have the backing of everyone who truly wanted this raid to suceed, and BTW, thx for telling us ur reason for attending the upcoming Vox raid, I&quot;m sure Lag and Flar read that /slashed out your name on list of people, they shouldn't have to put on a show to ammuse your sorry *ss, thats rediculous, they deserve better respect, and u need to start showing it to them!<br>

P.S. &quot;Tis easy to blame others, but do you not find the fault within yourself?&quot; I know I don't b/c I gave it my all and did what I should have, did u? Ya, guess it truly is easy to blame others. And I'm not doing this to blame u, there is some in there but I honest to goodness don't feel like I messed up at all, but am writing this primarily b/c something HAS TO BE DONE about mistreating somebody like this.

That being said, everyone also has a choice to participate, attend or help - or not. Please realize that we are all in this together, there is no &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;.  People have stopped coming to CoG raids since the inception of them, and most of the times, it was the &quot;us want good service... not happy? Me leave.&quot; reaction that I have come to love so much in the RL (yea, insert sarcasm here).<br>
<br>
If you want to participate in these KGoC raids, be aware that this is not about being as efficient and effective and oh-so-uber and getting good loot ... quite honestly, there are enough guilds and alliances out there that can do that.  The challenge of the KGoC is to offer an alternative to these established groupings and to allow people to meet new people, to debate strategies, and just to have fun with people you don't interact with day-in and day-out.<br>
<br>
I think the concerns raised should be raised here, and it's never an easy thing to come out and be critical, so my hats off to people who try to help by making constructive suggestions for the sake of improving this. <br>
<br>
The only thing I would like to ask of people is to remember that everyone has feelings and opinion, regardless of who they are.  Have enough dignity to treat people with respect and decency in any type of communication you may be involved in.  Be aware and acknowledge that there are tasks that only a few such as Lagdalen and Flarren have volunteered to do without purely selfish reasons. <br>

I apologize, I shouldn't have tried to blame you for anything, and for that I am sorry. Understand, I'm still very upset at the treatment you showed to Flarren and Lagdalen on your post, when Haemish stepped down, to say, &quot;hey, I'll give it a shot&quot; so willingly and to want to help, but on the first time when they don't succeed, to post what you did about them, to me is unacceptable. However, I shouldn't have said , &quot;hey, don't come back if u r gonna act like that&quot;, that was wrong, thats up to Lag and Flar, so I&quot;m sorry for that. However, I think it would be great if you could in turn apologize to Lagdalen and Flarren for your attacks on them, u know what I mean just like everybody does, I'm sure it would mean alot to them, but of course, thats up to you Sinian.

<br>
 I was healer in the triage line. You say we could no keep up with heals and there were many tanks... No there were not many tanks, and healers are not supposed to be oom they are suposed to die. If you read all the posts you woudl have understood it. Beside that havign bard in the triage line is useless. It would be half a mana bub between first heal and last heal for a healer. A healer oom is a healer supsoed to go and get killed in the lair. Maybe you don't play you bard so well finally...<br>
 If you really come to Vox jsut to check out our leaders,  Iwould say... hmmm... something liek go away? We don't want you? Yes that's it, still only my opinion, but truely, I wouldn't liek to be in same raid as you anymore.<br>
<br>
 For the casters... Well hehe sending them at 20%? Strange,  Idon't udnerstand your point on that, all I know is that it has been said, by experimented people that the nukers should have been sent earlier. That has been one of the msitake of leadership and Lag DID accepted it on her own part.<br>
 You either feel targeted by all that have been said before... Either a friend of yours was and yo udfefend him... Either yo udon't know what you are talking about. I don't know. Anyway I don't see anything i nyour p^st thatworths to be remembered. Oh yes one thing. Your name. I will learn to avoid it during the raids.<br>
 If you had just sent a post with your opinions... But here is a contstant attack on Lagdalen and other leaders. I have no power to do anything to you of course, if yo ure allowed to raid with CoG again ect... It s not my busyness. Jsut know I don't like you.<br>

<br>
 A few more points. &quot;I can only work with people that are willing to work with others.&quot; I Agree, with this. What else could one expect. However I must question why you think others were unwilling to work with you. Was there something in your mind durring the raid that told you others were unwilling to go where you followed? And as for people not understanding the assist command, what do you think the constant pulls outside Karnors are but a way of Plvling. I meet so many People that only know one way of killing they truly are newbies.<br>
<br>
 As for your expierience at raids, that I never attacked. What I did say was you were inexpirenced at leading raids. There is nothing wrong with that, we all need somewhere to start. But perhaps this is inaccurate. Would it not be better to say you were inexpirenced with those you were leading? &quot;I am far from new to running raids, I am simply new to running CoG's raids&quot;. I can see where this mark of inexpirence was against you. You saw it yourself when those you were expecting did not show. Wouldn't it have been better to bring this to light from the start rather then wait till we were just outside of his lair?<br>
<br>
 I told no one to wait on the nuke. To be honest it was my OWN nuke that I held till naggy was 20%. I held it as long as I did because it didn't occure to me to use it till I did. Ultimatly that is what killed me, the Dirge is an AE song and Naggy rushed me right when it pulsed and I was caught much like a chanter in his own mez. I would've used it sooner, however I never did see the command for the nukes to go in. A point with which you agreed with me, &quot;I admit yes I should have repeated commands more than I did. Not everyone stops to read the red on their screen and next time I will be spamming the zone so you guys can read it clearly&quot;.<br>
<br>
 It is nice to know you did not panic. However next time you lead a raid I suggest you let your troops know you have not paniced so they may remained focused on the trouble at hand.<br>
<br>
 As for your tactic in attaining FM in death. I see some merit. The cleric in my group was the first to die as I recall, yet he never did seem to respawn in the room. He must have been one of those nukes that didn't bind outside like he was supposed to. Perhaps this is what blinded me to the thinking in your tactic. You truly didn't take enough time to make sure people understood the tactics you were going to use.<br>
<br>
 I still pray you have learned every mistake that was made on this raid, and also that you do not put any blame on your troops. That is the sign of a true leader. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usinian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sinian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/18/01 8:18:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nagafen Recap</span><hr size=1>  Well a few more words for those that think me disrespectful. Respect is earned. I followed Lag's lead on this raid thinking she must have some merit to attain control of it, and as for my own actions on the raid I will not try to convince you of the role I played. To be honest I have nothing to prove to you, nor do I have the reason to do so.<br>
<br>
 I feel that my attack was warrented, but only in that it brought out the true thoughts of those involved. I do appologise that it hit an emotional mark, and feelings were hurt, but such is life. Through error we learn. Through pain we learn, and in learning we grow stronger. Euwyn I do feel sorry for you. You do not see any mistakes you made, in your eyes you did everything to perfection. I would say that you have lost the ability to grow, however you have already proved me wrong. You reminded yourself that this is an open forum where we should not fear for giving critism, as it gives us a new licence on thought. In this you have demenstrated your ability to grow, and I accept your apology for any harsh word you may have spoken in your post.<br>
<br>
 Now then that being said, I would like to comment on the nature of the KCoG as I percieve it. People come to the CoG looking for a chance at something they would not normally be able to do. In other words they are inexpirenced. This is a given, you cannot change this, to blame this as the fault in the plans is assinine. I do relize that the CoG is lead by people with expirence, and through this they succeed. My attacks on lag are rooted in this. I heard plenty of cry for the change in others yet no course of action to change the faults found in the leader. Am I to believe that the CoG is a bunch of sheep lead by hipocrits?<br>
<br>
 No I will not show up for Vox, in fact she is being raided now as I write this. It was has been made very clear to me that the inner syndicate running CoG is displeased with me and my oppinions. Haemish has already taken it upon himself to remove me from the dragon mailing lists, so there is no need for me to ask for it to be done. My accusations and fury were in no way directed souly at Lag but at the CoG as a whole. I blamed the failure of Naggy on the CoG.<br>
<br>
 It does pain me now to know I will never be accepted in the inner circle of the CoG. That I will never be a part of that elitest circle that feels they control so much of the server, I could cry (okay enough sarcasm). I do however wish to thank you for showing me the true nature of the CoG, it truly is nothing I wish to be a part of. Do not think however that this means you have gotten rid of me. As long as the CoG holds true to the illusion that they are a unifying force for those without resource on the Karana server I will be there. If I am shuned for being vocal in my thoughts they will only grow louder. As it stands I see this &quot;council&quot; as a stagnent pool of elitest swine that strives to make themselves the 'Uber' players of the server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CBC6B1><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uplangstrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>P Langstrump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Least Equipped 55th Level Druid</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(5/18/01 10:26:41 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.interlog.com/~wings/jane/a_lindgren/lindgren_pics/pippi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nagafen Recap</span><hr size=1> &quot;uber players&quot; *snickers<br>
<br>
Want to know how I got into the inner circle (and that was before I joined the Silver Daggers)?  I just started showing up and attending all the meetings, opened my mouth and went my own way to organize what I wanted to do, very simple - yea, I did it all by myself because I was stubborn enough to believe that I could pull it off. That's what in the end will earn you respect within the CoG and across the server.  Every single person here who has volunteered for one activity or other has shown up at one of the meetings to listen and to be heard, but I guess that's one &quot;trick&quot; you may have not noticed yet. <br>
<br>
How pathetic to come up with these insults just because you feel noone's paying you the respect YOU think you have deserved so much. <br>
<br>

p.s.: As for CoG losing to Naggy last time, so what? Winning all the time is neither the ultimate goal of life nor the goal of these raids here. <p><HR>

&quot;As it stands I see this &quot;council&quot; as a stagnent pool of elitest swine that strives to make themselves the 'Uber' players of the server.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sinian what on earth are you trying to say here. Do you actually read anything that is posted on this board. Are you attempting to imply that people like Lagdalen and Haemish and any of the rest of us who get involved in Council events are trying to run everything that happens on the server! ! ! I mean really what kind of a comment is that.<br>
<br>
Most of the events that the council runs including everything from Planes raids, Dragon raids and Mixer hunts are all run so that the little guy gets a chance to do big things, how can you perceve that as trying to be uber.<br>
<br>
All you have to do to get in to the so called inner circle (which doesn't really exist) is as Pippi said open your mouth and get involved with council events.<br>
I am in a small guild we can't do these things alone. I haven't got as involved in the council as much as I hope to in the future but I have been attending the meetings I make my points and these people listen. Back when I was level 22 I went to my first meeting I had a point to make I made it and we discussed it. If they were all such elitest swine why the heck would they bother listening to a point made by someone as lowly as I was.<br>
<br>
You also say your attack was warrented, how can you possibly say this. No attack in such a situation is warrented if you were trying to help Lag with advice on how to make things go smoother then why the hell do you need to attack her to do it. You say respect is earned I say Lag has earned our respect by the very fact that she had the guts to stand up and take the lead. I didn't see you volenteering. Also you mention that no course of action has been suggested to change the faults found in Lag but as it goes you are really the only one who has found these so called faults in fact after you the person who has been hardest on Lag is Lagdalen herself. Sinian mybe you need to learn abit more about the people involved in the Council before you start attacking them. I don't even begin to know most of them but I think I can certainly say I understand where most of them are comming from better than you.<br>
<br>
The fact that Lagdalen lead the KCoG to victory over Vox last night only fuels my belief that she is the right choice of raid leader.<br>

Respect is earned.&quot;<br>
<br>
Heed your own words, Sinian. Do something to earn the respect to lend credence to your attack before you launch it. Otherwise it sounds like the rantings of a ten year old who didn't get his way.<br>
<br>
You seem to be under the impression that the KCoG is here to do dragons and planes. Did you even bother to read the vision statement before you decided to involve yourself, or did you just charge in blindly, having no clue what you were signing up for except to attend a dragon raid? Your posts indicate you either did not read, or did not understand, the purpose of the Council.<br>
<br>
Attend something besides the dragon or plane raids. Try the next round of Mixer hunts, or one of the &quot;for fun&quot; events. That's what the Council is about. Dragons and planes are just one small aspect of it.. a perk that happened because people said &quot;Hey, we can do this... I just know we can!&quot; and then made it happen. You have no idea of, nor will you ever know, the work that went into just this small part of the Council's activity on this server.<br>
<br>
Yes, respect is earned. Take a bit of advice. Criticism, when done correctly, can be a powerful tool toward change. Criticism, when delivered in the form of an attack, with statements made in complete ignorance of the facts, accomplishes nothing save a loss of respect for the person delivering it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do however wish to thank you for showing me the true nature of the CoG, it truly is nothing I wish to be a part of.&quot; <br>
<br>
Yes, attending one KCoG dragon raid certainly does make you a completely knowledgable expert on the true nature of the Council. Try attending a Council meeting. Try educating yourself before you try to educate others. You'll find it more rewarding, I assure you.<br>
<br>
&quot;As it stands I see this &quot;council&quot; as a stagnent pool of elitest swine that strives to make themselves the 'Uber' players of the server.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hate to break it to you, Sinian, but the four rotation targets that the Council sponsors raids to are not &quot;Uber&quot; targets. Haemish founded this Council on the premise that it would serve as a launching pad for events that benefitted all the players on Karana who wished to participate. It has done that, and much more. A host of players have put their names on the line working to provide opportunities for everyone. Lagdalen is the latest in a very long line of exceptional people who have enjoyed providing avenues of fun for others. They do so, and will continue to do so long after you are gone and forgotten, in spite of the fact that people such as yourself will always be around to foster contempt based on ignorance while refusing to put their own name on the line for the same ideal. <br>
<br>
Thankfully, the vast majority of players recognize the opportunities the Council provides and try to show their appreciation for the people willing to work in their behalf. Those players are what the Council is all about, not dragons and planes and uber loot and reputation garnering.<br>

<br>
p.s. I seriously doubt I have been removed from the mailing list, yet I never received an email notification for Vox either. Don't sit around waiting for Haemish to do all the work for you. Try taking it on yourself to know when the raid will be happening, and using the email alert as confirmation. Or, if you'd rather, feel free to sit and wait, then come here and post about how persecuted you are.. whichever makes you happy.<br>

<br>
I was not on your raid, but I had to chime in with my support for you two. It takes a lot of character and effort to step up to lead a raid of this magnitude. You open yourself for criticism from everyone by doing so. If the raid is deemed a failure, you are to blame, and if it is a success, it was a team effort. <br>
<br>
That alone is reason for most, to not want to take the step up to leading, organizing, and executing a raid like this. It takes a lot of sweat and effort to organize a raid with this many people. It would be tough enough to do for a large guild, where everyone already is familiar with each other, each other's playing styles, the rules and plan of attack for the raid, and the familiarity of knowing everyone on the raid. Try to do the same thing on a CoG raid and it is that much more difficult: Lots of people on these raids have never even met a majority of the other fellow raiders, all come from different guilds with different styles of gameplay, some are not guilded at all, some are disciplined and experienced and listen and follow instructions while others don't or won't. And some people come to these raids with extensive solo careers under their belts, so they are not as finely tuned for depending on others, or for following orders, and such.<br>
<br>
The fact is, the diversity of people, and their styles makes these raids even tougher to do, than say a one guild raid with the same objective. They can still be done, even with the diversity of people and styles, it's just that it is a lot harder.<br>
<br>
I gladdens me to see people getting up there against the odds, to lead these events. I saddens me to see personal attacks on the leadership, and not just objective critisism of points on the raid, with suggestions of ways to improve upon things.<br>
<br>
If anyone else would like to take a leadership position, it is a matter of volunteering, and organizing a raid. With the number of qualified and experienced people in CoG, there should certainly be more people offering to lead these events to share the responsibility in making these things take place. <br>
<br>
It takes a lot to get up and do these. I am not confident I could lead one. I depend on others to do that. I have volunteered to help organize and be backing support for others who have led them in the past. I wish to encourage you both to not get discouraged. A raid that goes horribly wrong, yet you learn from, is not a failure. Only the objective was not met. You will improve upon things with each successive raid. <br>
<br>
I also challenge anyone who thinks they can do it better to bring it on. Not as in a challenge to see who leads better, but as a means for sharing the duties and burdens of making these things happen, so it's not only a couple of people doing it all the time for everyone elses benefit.<br>
<br>
I admire your efforts, Flarren and Lagdalen. You have won my respect as leaders. I wish you all the best in you future raids. Thank you for providing raids that this many people can go on that otherwise would not get to. <br>
