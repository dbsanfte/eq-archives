<br>
All the rhetoric on whether or not we should go to war against Iraq has got my insane little brain spinning like a roulette wheel.  I enjoy reading opinions from both sides, but I have detected a hint of confusion from some of you.  As I was reading the paper recently, I was reminded of the best advice someone ever gave me.  He told me about the KISS method (Keep It Simple Stupid).  So, with this as a theme, I’d like to apply this theory for those who don’t quite get it.  My hope is that we can simplify things a bit and recognize a few important facts.<br>
<br>
Here are 10 things to consider when voicing an opinion on this important issue:<br>
<br>
1.  Between President Bush and Saddam Hussein … Hussein is the BAD GUY.<br>
<br>
2.  If you have faith in the United Nations to do the right thing, keep this in mind: they have Libya heading the committee on human rights and Iraq heading the global disarmament committee.  Do your own math here.<br>
<br>
3.  If you use GOOGLE search and type in “French Military Victories,” your reply will be: “did you mean French Military Defeats?” (Well it was this way until everyone spammed a site about this)<br>
<br>
4.  If your only anti-war slogan is “No War for Oil,” sue your school district for allowing you to slip through the cracks and robbing you of the education you deserve.<br>
<br>
5.  Saddam and Bin Laden will not seek United Nations approval before they try to kill us.<br>
<br>
6.  Despite common belief, Martin Sheen is not the President.  He only plays one on TV.<br>
<br>
7.  Even if you are anti-war, you are still an “Infidel” and Bin Laden wants you dead too.<br>
<br>
8.  If you believe in a “vast right-wing conspiracy,” but not in the danger that Hussein poses, quit hanging out with the Dell computer dude.<br>
<br>
9.  We are trying to liberate them.  He is trying to kill us.<br>
<br>
10.  Whether you are for military action or against it, our young men and women overseas are fighting for us to defend our right to speak out.  We all need to support them without reservation.<br>

Way to fall for the 'Saddam Hussien = Osama' bullshit that CNN's been trying to sell Dennis.  Let's conveniently ignore the fact that Osama considers Saddam every bit as much a godless infidel as Georgie boy.  And he dares rip on protesters for being uneducated.<br>
<br>

<br>
Get ready for this...it's long, but I got it a few days ago and I thought I'd share with you just exactly who's reading through our information to make decisions for our Country.<br>
<br>
Let's compare:  <br>
<br>
President George W. Bush: Received a Bachelors Degree from Yale University and an MBA from Harvard Business School. He served as an F-102 pilot for the Texas Air National Guard.  He was elected Governor on November 8, 1994. In a historic re-election victory, he became the first Texas Governorto be elected to consecutive four-year terms on November 3, 1998. <br>
<br>
Vice President Dick Cheney: Earned a B.A. in 1965 and a M.A. in 1966, both in political science. Two years later, he won an American Political Science Association congressional fellowship. One of Vice President Cheney's primary duties is to share with individuals, members of Congress and foreign leaders, President Bush's vision to strengthen our economy, secure our homeland and win the War on Terrorism. In his official role as President of the Senate, Vice President Cheney regularly goes to Capital Hill to meet with Senators and members of the House of Representatives to work on the Administration's legislative goals.<br>
<br>
Secretary of State Colin Powell: Educated in the New York City public schools, graduating from the City College of New York (CCNY), where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in geology. He also participated in ROTC at CCNY and received a commission as an Army second lieutenant upon graduation in June 1958. His further academic achievements include a Master of Business Administration Degree from George Washington University. Secretary Powell is the recipient of numerous U.S. and foreign military awards and decorations. Secretary Powell's civilian awards include two Presidential Medals of Freedom, the President's Citizens Medal, the Congressional Gold Medal, the Secretary of State Distinguished Service Medal, and the Secretary of Energy Distinguished Service Medal. Several schools and other institutions have been named in his honor and he holds honorary degrees from universities and colleges across the country. (Note: He retired as Four Star General in the United States Army)<br>
<br>
Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge: Raised in a working class family in veterans' public housing in Erie. He earned a scholarship to Harvard, graduating with honors in 1967. After his first year at The Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he served as an infantry staff sergeant in Vietnam, earning the Bronze Star for Valor. After returning to Pennsylvania, he earned his Law Degree and was in private practice before becoming Assistant District Attorney in Erie County. He was elected to Congress in 1982. He was the first enlisted Vietnam combat veteran elected to the U.S. House, and was overwhelmingly re-elected six times.<br>
<br>
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice: Earned her Bachelor's Degree in Political Science, Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa, from the University of Denver in 1974; her Master's from the University of Notre Dame in 1975; and<br>
her Ph.D. from the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Denver in 1981. (Note: Rice enrolled at the University of Denver at the age of 15, graduating at 19 with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science (Cum Laude).  Both of her advanced degrees are also in Political Science. She is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has been awarded Honorary Doctorates from Morehouse College in 1991, the University of Alabama in 1994, and the University of Notre Dame in 1995. At  Stanford, she has been a member of the Center for International Security and Arms Control, a Senior<br>
Fellow of the Institute for International Studies, and a Fellow (by courtesy) of the Hoover Institution. Her books include Germany Unified and Europe Transformed (1995) with Philip Zelikow, The Gorbachev Era (1986) with Alexander Dallin, and Uncertain Allegiance: The Soviet Union and the Czechoslovak Army (1984). She also has written numerous articles on Soviet and East European foreign and defense policy, and has addressed audiences in settings ranging from the U.S. Ambassador's Residence in Moscow to the Commonwealth Club to the 1992 and 2000 Republican National Conventions. From 1989 through March 1991, the period of German reunification and the final days of the Soviet Union, she served in the Bush Administration as Director, and then Senior Director, of Soviet and East European Affairs in the National Security Council, and a Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. In 1986, while an international affairs fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, she served as Special Assistant to the Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 1997, she served on the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender -- Integrated Training in the Military. She was a member of the boards of directors for the Chevron Corporation, the Charles Schwab Corporation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the University of Notre Dame, the International Advisory Council of J.P. Morgan and the San Francisco Symphony Board of Governors. She was a Founding Board member of the Center for a New Generation, an educational support fund for schools in East Palo Alto and East Menlo Park, California and was Vice President of the Boys and Girls Club of the Peninsula. In addition, her past board service has encompassed such organizations as Transamerica Corporation, Hewlett Packard, the Carnegie Corporation, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, The Rand Corporation, the National Council for Soviet and East European Studies, the Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition and KQED, public broadcasting for San Francisco.<br>
<br>
President Bush and his cabinet are briefed daily, even hourly, on the War on Terror and threats to our security.  They are privy to information gathered around the world concerning the Middle East, the threats to America, the intentions of terrorists and terrorist-supporting governments. They are in constant communication with the CIA, the FBI, Interpol, NATO, The United Nations, our own military, and those of our allies around the world.<br>
<br>
I'm just going to venture a guess and say these guys actually know what the hell they are talking about, and doing.  Plenty of book education and real world experiance between these people to actually trust the decisions they are making.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sandalorn>Sandalorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I am the Highway!</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/19/03 12:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dennis Miller sums up the war</span><hr size=1> 2.

I don't know everything.  Dennis Miller doesn't know everything.  I posted this because what he said makes people think.  It made me think.  He made light of a very touchy situation.<br>

Some of us actually make sense in what we post because we gather information from different sources, analyze the credibility of the source and make decisions based on that.<br>

Secondly, nowhere in the post about dennis miller did he say Saddam=Osama. He's referring to our overall actions.<br>
<br>
I know one thing is for sure...if for some reason they found that Saddam had something to do with 9/11, then the whole world would want us to do something about it...but because he hasnt, its &quot;No..dont do that....&quot;<br>

Sorry, never been there, don't want to go. I don't think Saddam's a nice person, but the US has 0 authority or reason to go in and force a regime change in defiance of the world council just because they don't like him.<br>

<br>
Well read this from 2001:<br>
<br>
Iraq was the only Arab-Muslim country that did not condemn the September 11 attacks against the United States. A commentary of the official Iraqi station on September 11 stated that America was &quot;…reaping the fruits of [its] crimes against humanity.&quot; Subsequent commentary in a newspaper run by one of Saddam's sons expressed sympathy for Usama Bin Ladin following initial US retaliatory strikes in Afghanistan. In addition, the regime continued to provide training and political encouragement to numerous terrorist groups, although its main focus was on dissident Iraqi activity overseas. <br>
<br>
Iraq provided bases to several terrorist groups including the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), and the Abu Nidal organization (ANO). In 2001, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) raised its profile in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by carrying out successful terrorist attacks against Israeli targets. In recognition of the PFLP's growing role, an Iraqi Vice President met with former PFLP Secretary General Habbash in Baghdad in January 2001 and expressed continued Iraqi support for the intifadah. Also, in mid-September, a senior delegation from the PFLP met with an Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister. Baghdad also continued to host other Palestinian rejectionist groups, including the Arab Liberation Front, and the 15 May Organization.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Czech police continued to provide protection to the Prague office of the US Government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), which produces Radio Free Iraq programs and employs expatriate journalists. The police presence was augmented in 1999 and 2000, following reports that the Iraqi Intelligence Service might retaliate against RFE/RL for broadcasts critical of the Iraqi regime. As concerns over the facility's security mounted through 2000, the Czechs expelled an Iraqi intelligence officer in April 2001. <br>
<br>
The Iraqi regime has not met a request from Riyadh for the extradition of two Saudis who had hijacked a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight to Baghdad in 2000. Disregarding its obligations under international law, the regime granted political asylum to the hijackers and gave them ample opportunity to voice their criticisms of alleged abuses by the Saudi Government in the Iraqi Government-controlled and international media.<br>
<br>
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) Terrorism <br>
The September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon confirmed the resolution and capability of terrorists to plan, organize, and execute attacks to produce mass casualties. In the wake of these unprecedented attacks, terrorists increasingly may look to use chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) materials—many of which can cause significant casualties—to rival the events of September 11. Such materials, information about the technology required to create them, and information about how to deliver the materials continue to be available through a variety of means. <br>
<br>
Usama Bin Ladin has professed the acquisition of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; (WMD) to be a &quot;religious duty&quot; and he has threatened to use such weapons. Reports that documents retrieved from al-Qaida facilities in Afghanistan contain information on CBRN materials underscore Bin Ladin's rhetoric. The threat is not limited to Bin Ladin and al-Qaida. Other information indicates interest in acquiring and using CBRN materials by a small but growing number of other terrorist groups. The use by HAMAS of poisons and pesticides to coat shrapnel in improvised explosive devices is one example. The recent arrest in Italy of a group which had in its possession a compound that could produce hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas under certain circumstances, along with maps of the underground utility systems near the US Embassy, is also demonstrative of terrorist intentions to employ CBRN materials in their activities. <br>
<br>
CBRN terrorism events to date have generally involved crude and improvised delivery means that have been effective but only marginally so. The lethal materials employed in some events (with the exception of the anthrax used in the incidents in the United States) also have been crudely manufactured. Other events have featured materials (toxic industrial chemicals and materials, poisons and pesticides, radiological source materials embedded in legitimate measuring instruments, etc.) that have been acquired legitimately or illegitimately and used for purposes other than those for which they were intended. While terrorist events involving these materials and improvised delivery systems can be lethal and can cause significant damage and disruption, they pale in comparison to the number of casualties and damage levels that could occur should terrorists ever acquire militarized Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and the systems to deliver them. <br>
<br>
Preventing the proliferation of WMD, relevant materials, and related technologies, while long a pillar of national security, has become an even more urgent global priority since September 11. President George Bush made clear in his 29 January 2002 State of the Union address that the United States has as one of two great objectives to &quot;...prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world.&quot; Nations around the world have joined the United States in calling for greater efforts to prevent terrorist acquisition of WMD, relevant materials, and related technologies. <br>
<br>
The United States is working within appropriate multilateral nonproliferation and other international forums and is encouraging countries worldwide to adopt more stringent nonproliferation policies and programs to help ensure that terrorists or the states who sponsor and support them cannot acquire WMD, materials, or related technologies. <br>
<br>
Active involvement by the nonproliferation communities in the United States and other nations is a welcome addition to the capabilities of the international Coalition engaged in the war on terrorism. Such cooperative activities should help buttress existing international counterterrorism strategies and programs for combating CBRN terrorism in the areas of diplomacy, intelligence sharing, cooperative law enforcement arrangements, technology exchange, security and force protection, and training that have been traditionally undertaken. <br>

Guilty until proven innocent. This is the new American way. And no evidence is necessary to order someone killed. Just the say-so of the man with the gun.<br>
<br>
Everything Americans have worked for over the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>past 227 years</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, to establish the rule of law over the emotions of the mob and the predations of the aristocracy, has been nullified by fake terror, insincere legislators and endless bribery.<br>
<br>
Vigilante justice is the new order of the day in this frightening 2003 edition of the United States of America. Due process, the right to a fair trial, the right to be safe and secure in one's home &quot; these are all things of the past, things we used to defend as the best traits of American freedom in those happy days before the self-inflicted War on Terror. (* - see note below).<br>
<br>
Now we are defending the right of the president to order people killed because he says they are bad guys. He doesn't need any evidence because he's the president, according to Ari Fleischer, his sycophantic press secretary. This is what we are presenting to our children as the actions of a democracy.<br>
<br>
As the reptilian politician Henry Hyde said recently, the Constitution is just not relevant anymore. What he means is people don't have rights anymore. What seems to be the surest guarantee toward success in America these days is a criminal conviction incurred while participating in the wholesale fleecing of the American population. As in the cases of John Poindexter, Eliot Abrams and Ollie North (both George Bushes could also be in this category were the judiciary more honest), guilty verdicts in service to the hidden hand of the power elite are a sure way to find full employment in this era of runaway corruption.<br>
<br>
Guilty until proven innocent. Look at poor pathetic Saddam. Nothing he says counts, ever since he had that conversation with U.S. ambassador April Glaspie, who told him the U.S. wouldn't really mind if he invaded Kuwait. So because he had a legimate grievance &quot; slant drilling/theft of oil by the Sabah family &quot; he did invade. And what a penalty! A half million Iraqis dead (mostly children) and 13 years later, the U.S. is still bombing him. What did he do against the United States? Nothing. He was our ally. But we set him up. All other U.S. &quot;allies&quot; should be taking note of this behavior, but I doubt that they are. Just like in our country, the leaders of those countries who took large amounts of money to be our allies are too busy concealing their blood money to be genuinely interested in the fate of their own people. Just ask Hosni Mubarak, or Prince Whatshisname? That Saudi sultan who mostly hangs out in Monte Carlo and insists he's a devout Muslim. Just like the supposed hijackers were devout Muslims. And speaking of the hijackers, they are definitely guilty until proven innocent. I heard it on CNN, and also from Tony Blair.<br>
<br>
And even if we didn't get their names right, they're still guilty until proven innocent, no matter who they are or what names they use. It's them and they're guilty. Just ask your president.<br>
<br>
Guilty until proven innocent. Osama bin Laden. Does he really exist? Are any of his tapes legit? And if he does exist, isn't he a CIA operative? He used to be, when he first started getting financial assistance from Washington. This is why the feds blocked John O'Neill's investigation. He was about to find out that bin Laden was working for the CIA, and that those embassy hits in Africa were done by the Mossad, not by Islamic Jihad (although there is some debate about the actual difference between the two). But we had solid evidence against bin Laden, Blair said so. He just wouldn't tell us what it was. And that's why 5,000 Afghanis had to die, even though there never really was any intention to catch bin Laden (if he really exists). But those Afghanis were guilty because they couldn't prove their innocence - they couldn't prove they didn't facilitate the destruction of two skyscrapers in New York - and that's why they had to die, in a hail of anonymous bunker busters from 30,000 feet. <br>
  <br>
Guilty until proven innocent. Timothy McVeigh! Remember him. He supposedly parked a truck bomb in front of a big building. This bomb supposedly blew down this big building, killed a lot of mothers and babies, but amazingly failed to knock down a sapling right next to the truck. The Air Force general who said that building came down as a result of many major explosives attached to stanchions inside the building was never listened to. An Oklahoma City cop who was gathering information mysteriously committed suicide. A federal agent who had all sorts of testimony about Iraqis in the neighborhood was told to shut up and drummed out of the BATF.<br>
<br>
And McVeigh - remember him? He was guilty until proven innocent. One of the witnesses at his execution said he never did stop breathing. A story much later in the Weekly World News (that paragon of journalistic integrity - whoops! &quot;Statue of Elvis Found on Mars! ) - insisted that McVeigh never was executed, had had plastic surgery, took steroids, and was living on an island in the state of Idaho. Well, wouldn't you know the building where that story and that newspaper were published was the first place hit in the anthrax attacks. Poor Bob Stevens, the fellow who died in that attack. He was clearly guilty until proven innocent.<br>
<br>
Guilty until proven innocent. Paul Wellstone, liberal Minnesota senator &quot;accidentally&quot; killed in a plane crash shortly before an election.<br>
<br>
Guilty until proven innocent. Mel Carnahan, liberal Missouri senator &quot;accidentally&quot; killed in a plane crash shortly before an election.<br>
<br>
Guilty until proven innocent. Vicki Weaver. A bullet in the head for being married to a man who was set up by the feds. That man who shot her, FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi, was clearly guilty but ruled innocent by a federal judge (after the feds gave Randy Weaver several million in hopes he'd keep his mouth shut, which he didn't.).<br>
<br>
Guilty until proven innocent. Those 25 dead children at David Koresh's burned out compound in Waco, whom a Fox reporter called collateral damage. Those kids will never be proven innocent. They were guilty and deserved to be slaughtered by the U.S. government, according to federal agents who participated in the raid, who helped in the killing of children and then denied they did. <br>
  <br>
Guilty until proven innocent. The Egyptian dupes who participated in the first attack on the World Trade Centers, who were guided by an FBI informant who tried to get his controllers to stop the attack, but the FBI guys in charge preferred instead to let the bomb go off. <br>
  <br>
Who is guilty? Who is innocent? It's almost as if whomever Bush says is guilty is actually innocent and vice versa. I mean, Cheney is clearly guilty of obstruction of justice in the California energy crisis because his closest colleagues made millions of dollars and the vice president refuses to divulge any of the details of his energy meetings. Why? They were planning how to rip off California. It's so obvious. Poindexter was guilty of lying about the Reagan-Bush October Surprise and now is in charge of watching all of us. <br>
  <br>
The same logic can be applied to the latest World Trade Center coverup. The Patriot Act and Homeland Security Department were invented not to protect U.S. security from terrorist infiltration, they were devised to keep people from discovering the true culprits of the 9/11 attacks, and you can be sure many of them live in and around Washington. <br>
  <br>
So let's switch things around: let's give these power elite pigs a dose of their own medicine. Let's play by the very rules that they have created for us - their minions, their budsters (wildman columnist Al Martin quoting Dubya: BUDsters stands for broke, useless and depressed). Their logic is that people they suspect of uncovering any evidence that implicates the Bush cartel in anything are automatically &quot;enemy combatants,&quot; &quot;against us instead of with us,&quot; and liable to be imprisoned incommunicado without the previously usual Constitutional protection and right to a fair trial. (How could anybody get a fair trial now anyway with all the judges these clowns have appointed, all these insincere political functionaries rather than jurists with actual integrity?) <br>
  <br>
As with Saddam and bin Laden, and a host of other U.S. puppet dictators we have used over time and then discarded when they got too big for their britches, the U.S. media machine can say anything at all about these fools and get away with it, without a whit of proof. Rumsfeld keeps letting the real deal slip: the U.S. keeps planting phony stories in media around the world, and then says, no, we're not planting phony stories. <br>
  <br>
They can say anything they want, without a shred of evidence, and get away with it, because the big boys own all the big media and the vast majority of the little people are just too timid, too powerless, to confront the status quo. <br>
  <br>
Well, if they can say anything they want, then we can too. <br>
  <br>
Guilty until proven innocent: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and the Carlyle Group gang, Baker, Carlucci, Colin Powell and Poppy Bush. Under the laws they have devised for the American people, they are now guilty until proven innocent of mass murder and treason, incomprehensibly grand theft, too many counts of obstruction of justice to count, and perhaps the worst crime of all, the destruction of the American constitution, the very document, the principles that make America America. <br>
  <br>
What are we fighting for if we don't have that? Their right to unbridled corporate greed? To hell with that. I'm not fighting for that. If you, by your silence, choose to fight for that, you are surely guilty until proven innocent <br>
  <br>
I believe it is time to start judging these people who are making all these Nazi-type laws by these laws themselves. Bush and Cheney need to be in jail indefinitely, without access to counsel or family, for multiple counts of obstruction of justice, for widespread theft in the Enron, Harken, and Halliburton examples, where they have crafted laws (the vaccine orders and the invasion of Afghanistan) to directly benefit friends and members of their own families through government contracts. The younger Bush is directly involved in a conflict of interest when his father owns portions of several of the companies which have directly benefited from his recent decisions. <br>
  <br>
The real terrorists are Bush, Cheney and the big business cabal. Right now they are terrorizing the American people and all the people in the world by creating cynical unjust laws and then enforcing them with crooked cops and crooked judges. <br>
  <br>
With all the lies they have told about their business dealings, and all the false accusations they have made about Saddam and his supposed weapons of mass destruction (that America itself sold to him; Rumsfeld himself brokered the deal), we have every reason - EVERY REASON, WITH GOD AS OUR WITNESS - to believe that they are lying about what happened at the World Trade Center. It was the worst crime in American history, and they committed it. And now they are committing even more crimes against every decent, law-abiding person in the world. <br>
  <br>
They are clearly guilty, and I doubt very much they can prove their innocence. It is now time for every person in the world to insist that they try before the court of public opinion, and before God. <br>
  <br>
Let all the lying - and the cringing in fear - stop now. <br>
<br>
Let's have the truth - now. <br>
  <br>
Without a shadow of a doubt, they are all guilty until proven innocent. <br>
<br>
And I personally don't think they can &quot;prove&quot; their innocence without a massive police presence. <br>
<br>

If you got that from CNN or any other Western Agency then it is certainly falsified.  We all know the &quot;truth&quot; comes the unbiased EU agencies that are regulated so closely. Not to mention the unabridged truth coming from the family owned Iraqi National Radio Agency.<br>
<br>
Quit trying to persuade us with your US propagandra.  We won't fall for it.  Iraq is a good place with a suberb leader who is only trying to peacefully lead his nation into a golden age.  His citizens live in complete joy and are heard to say repeatedly &quot;I love Saddam, I love Saddam&quot; right before they get their alotted three loaves of bread per month.  But that is only because Saddam is trying to get the county in shape on a new kick-ass bread and water diet, not because he spends his nations money financing terror and chaos around the globe and had nothing left over for the common folk.<br>
<br>
Shame on you Livius.  You have let CNN and western correspondence think for you.  PAGAN!<br>

<br>
Palm Beach, Florida - President George Bush claimed this week his impending war against Iraq would bring peace and democracy to the Middle East, and liberate Iraqis from repression. <br>
<br>
At the same time, in a move clearly aimed at intimidating the media, the White House denounced a CBS News interview with President Hussein in which the Iraqi leader asserted his nation had nothing to do with 9/11 or al-Qaida, as 'propaganda'. <br>
<br>
Now, I have no love for Saddam's sinister, brutal regime. The last time I was in Baghdad, late 1990, the Iraqi secret police threatened to hang me as a spy after I discovered a group of British technicians and scientists who had been secretly sent by the British government to produce anthrax and other germ weapons for Iraq to use against Iran. <br>
<br>
But what I dislike even more than Saddam's nasty regime are government lies and propaganda. Since 9/11, North Americans have been subjected to the most intense propaganda campaign from their government since World War II. Much of the mainstream US media has been intimidated by the Administration into unquestioningly amplifying its party line, or, in the worst tradition of yellow, jingoist journalism, it acts as cheerleaders for war. I am reminded of the sycophantic Soviet media during the days of Chairman Leonid Brezhnev. <br>
<br>
The American public, often wobbly about geography, history and international affairs, has been alternatively terrified and enraged by bare-faced lies that Iraq was about to attack America with nuclear weapons or germs, and was a secret ally of al-Qaida. A shocking two-thirds of Americans mistakenly believe Iraq staged the 9/11 attacks. <br>
<br>
A surging wave of anti-Islamic hate promoted by Bush's allies on the Christian loony far right, and Administration repression of Muslims, frighteningly recall Europe's growing anti-semitism of the early 1930's. These are the reasons why a majority of Americans still support a war of pure aggression against Iraq, though more and more question the president's motives. <br>
<br>
It's frightening to see Bush claim with a straight face his war against Iraq will bring democracy and peace to the Mideast, and save Iraqis from repression. Why didn't he begin by saving Palestinians from the repression by his alter-ego and, increasingly, his mentor, Israel's Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon. If Bush really cared about Mideast democracy, he's had two years to do something about US-sponsored dictatorships like Egypt and Pakistan, or medieval autocracies such as Morocco, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and American's Gulf protectorates. <br>
<br>
When Bush says he will bring democracy to benighted Iraqis, what he really means is US rule. In Bush-speak, 'democracy' has been perverted to mean US imperial hegemony: nations run by puppet rulers who makes all the right noises, like Afghanistan's US-installed figurehead, Hamid Karzai, while following Washington's orders to the letter. <br>
<br>
Bush's War is not about democracy, weapons of mass destruction, human rights, or terrorism. It has two main motivations. First, the Manifest Destiny crowd in Washington, led by VP Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The terrible events of 9/11 seemed to produce a psychotic reaction in these good, patriotic Americans, transforming them into 19th century imperialists. <br>
<br>
Their intention is perfectly clear. <br>
<br>
1. prevent any nation ever challenging US global hegemony;<br>
2. Dominating oil. The aggression against Iraq is not about oil per se, it is about control of oil. Before the Iraq crisis, the US imported about $18 billion of oil annually from the Mideast, but spent $31 billion keeping military forces there. Why? Control of Mideast oil gives the US domination over Europe and Japan, who draw most of their oil from the region. Domination of Mideast and Caspian oil will assure the US a permanent stranglehold over China and India, as well as Europe and Japan. <br>
The second, but almost invisible driving force is Israel's far right Likud government, which has come to dominate Bush Administration policy and US media commentary on the Mideast. The Clinton Administration was close to Israel's moderate Labor Party; Bush's camp is totally aligned with Israel's aggressive far right and mirrors its views and policies to a remarkable, unprecedented degree. Likud, and its powerful American supporters, want the US to crush Iraq into pieces. The principal beneficiary of the war against Iraq will be Israel. <br>
<br>
Many Americans simply don't understand their leadership is about to plunge the nation into an open-ended, dangerous colonial war. All the propaganda about democracy, human rights, and regional stability is the same kind of double-talk used by the 19th century British and French imperialists who claimed they were grabbing Africa and Asia to bring the benefits of Christian civilization to the heathens. <br>
<br>
A veteran US diplomat, John Kiesling, who just resigned from the State Department in protest over Iraq, eloquently described the damage inflicted on America by the run-amok Bush Administration: 'Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy that has been America's most potent weapon of both offense and defense since the days of Woodrow Wilson.' Amen. <br>
<br>
Misery loves company. American-occupied Iraq looks destined to join the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza as another human, political, and moral disaster for all concerned. &quot;<br>

The only point I'd like to make is because I might disagree with invading Iraq, it doesn't mean that I'm &quot;anti-American&quot;.<br>
