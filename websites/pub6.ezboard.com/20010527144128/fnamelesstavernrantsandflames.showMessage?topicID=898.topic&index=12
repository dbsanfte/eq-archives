Thanks to my good friend Dave who wrote:<br>
<br>
This column takes a back seat to no other column when it comes to declaring that presidential administrations have failed. Back in 1992, this column set a world indoor journalistic record when it formally declared the failure of the Bill Clinton administration a full month before Mr. Clinton actually took office. That is how far ``ahead of the curve'' this column is.<br>
<br>
And so it is high time that this column took stock of the administration of George ``W.'' Bush III Jr. -- to evaluate his presidency in a fair and balanced manner, looking not only at Mr. Bush's flaws, but also at his glaring weaknesses. In doing so, this column intends to give the incoming president the benefit of the doubt, in the generous spirit of loser Al ``Recount'' Gore, who, in his gracious concession speech, called upon the nation to ``forget our differences and unite behind our new president, who needs the support of every American, because he has the brain of a sea cucumber.''<br>
<br>
Despite Mr. Gore's harsh assessment, this column happens to think that Mr. Bush has not been a complete disaster in certain areas, such as high-level appointments. Many of the Bush appointees are experienced Washington hands who held high-level jobs under George Bush III Sr., Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and Warren G. Harding. Unfortunately, when these appointees were subjected to FBI background checks, it turned out that a number of them had, at some point in the past few decades, passed away.<br>
<br>
This column is not suggesting that a person should be deemed unqualified to hold high government office merely because that person has kicked the bucket. It makes no difference, for example, who serves as Secretary of Energy, as evidenced by the fact that for the past two years the post was filled -- and very capably -- by a Magic 8 Ball. Nobody knows what the Department of Energy does, including its employees, who spend their days waiting for the phone to ring, which never happens, except when the Department of Commerce, which is also bored out of its mind, makes prank calls to ask if the Energy Department's refrigerator is running.<br>
<br>
But certain top federal jobs are important. For example, the Secretary of State is responsible for taking a large entourage over to the Middle East every two weeks to broker a new historic peace accord. The Postmaster General is responsible for ensuring that every American, every working day, receives a stack of unwanted fourth-class mail the height of Al Pacino. And the Surgeon General is responsible for carrying on the decades-old quest for a cigarette-pack warning so scary that smokers actually take it seriously (``Whoa! Eyeball worms! I'm quitting!'').<br>
<br>
In key jobs such as these, the nation needs ``the best and the brightest.'' That is why this column is concerned about the mental sharpness of some of the older Bush appointees, particularly Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who recently stated that his highest military priority will be ``to stop Lee at Gettysburg.''<br>
<br>
But what has this column really alarmed is the economy. It does not look good. The trouble began last year, when Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan ``Mojo'' Greenspan, with no warning, raised interest rates sharply after having what a member of his staff described as a ``very upsetting experience'' involving the Hair Club for Men. As a result, the nation has been plunged into a recession. Former ``dot-com'' millionaires are now surviving on roadkill jerky. Sales of Porsche Boxsters and large, absurdly complicated gold watches that tell the phase of the moon have plunged to historically low levels. Bill Gates is down to his last 17 airplanes.<br>
<br>
This column has no choice but to blame the recession on the Bush administration. And to those who would argue that Mr. Bush is not responsible for the current economy, this column would respond with a trenchant quotation from the great philosopher Ralph ``Waldo'' Emerson: ``Tough noogies.'' The president ALWAYS gets credit or blame for the economy, even though he has almost nothing to do with it. Bill Clinton got tons of credit for the good economy of the past eight years, despite the fact that his total contribution consisted of payments to defense lawyers.<br>
<br>
So, having carefully considered all factors, this column hereby declares the incoming Bush administration a failure. Do not bother to thank this column: It is only doing its job. And do not become overly alarmed about the future. Instead, consider the inspirational words of one high government official, who, when asked to ponder the fate of this nation, answered, simply: ``Reply Hazy, Try Again.''<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  It's a bit hypocritical to say we shouldn't count the votes of people who can't follow general ballot directions, but complain about people not wanting to count the ballots of overseas voters who can't follow the directions on returning their ballots. But I guess it comes down more to who those ballots are going to count for rather than principle, huh? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Uh… the military voters followed the ballot directions as best they could. I don’t know if you fully understand their situation. They were deployed overseas; they did not have the opportunity to stop by the balloting areas in Florida to drop off their ballots. In fact they couldn’t even go to a post office to mail it out. Their votes were not counted because of a hyper-technicality. There was no way possible for them to get their ballots to the ballot counters in time. They weren’t overseas by their personal choice; duty to their country required them to be there. The same country that decided their votes didn’t count because Al Gore’s lawyers wanted Al Gore to win at any cost. That was absolute bullshit.<br>
<br>
So no it isn’t hypocritical at all. People’s votes not being counted because they were to stupid to figure them out and military forces over-seas votes not being counted because they didn’t make it here in time are very different issues. <br>
<br>
Enough about this crap. It’s over, Bush won, I voted for Nader, move on already!<br>

I do wish our government would realize that however many oil fields you find, it is not a renewable recourse, so sooner or later, alternative sources of energy are going to need to be found.

The military guys do get them turned in, in time. However, getting mail out of or in to is a military vessel or unit is not and cannot be a priority.<br>

4) Comparing idiots that don't bother to even read who they are voting for and then complain later that they voted for the wrong choice to the absentee ballots cast by military people at sea (some on the USS Cole) and not anywhere NEAR a PO is ludicrous and asinine.<br>
<br>
5) Gore’s campaign Chairman was Bill Daley.  He’s the son of infamous Cook County, Ill. political boss Richard J.Daley. Mayor Richard Daley's political machine was known for delivering whopping Democratic tallies by fair means and foul.<br>
<br>
6) And as far as the murder statistic goes. It means that Democrats have more followers in high crime areas. Which would tend to follow that that some of them are criminals themselves. Also, high crime areas are generally areas of undereducated people who believe media hype. Do I think that criminals have less rights than I do? You damn well betcha! Do I look down on undereducated people? No, I just wish government schools and the news sources they have access too weren't so biased.<br>

That's the beauty of this whole thing - it shows the flaws in many systems.  The military obviously neglects to follow standard postal procedures like the rest of us and it cost that poor fellow his vote.  The post mark is a legal binding stamp - where as his letter was probably dropped off by a military clerk with a bunch of other letters.  <br>
<br>
The military is using their own courrier service and it's obviously flawed if there is no legal receipt proving when it was delivered.  USPS, FedEx, DHL, and any other service has signatures for each package that are legal too.<br>
<br>
Not only do they need to improve the ballot system, but they need to get the military to validate their own mail for their employees or use another delivery service.  <br>
<br>
VERY SAD.<br>

It isn’t that the military “Neglects” to follow standard postal procedures. Standard postal procedures do not take the militaries needs into consideration. Anyone with any insight in military procedures and operations knows it is logistically impossible to hold military personal abroad accountable to the same rules (Postal/tax/whatever) as people living inside US borders.<br>
<br>
Gore’s lawyers knew this too. The point was they took an issue they knew could not be avoided and found a technicality to void the votes of men and women who have volunteered to place them selves in harms way to protect us. That sucks badly.<br>
<br>
It isn’t the militaries fault, it isn’t the postal services fault; it is ticky tack lawyers who’ll do whatever it takes to win’s fault.<br>

Those who are Republicans are subject to particular and seemingly relentless scrutiny. Right down to signatures on ballots being compared with signatures on registration cards. A ballot bearing a         domestic postmark because a soldier had voted, sent his ballot home to his parents and asked them to mail it in on time, is thrown out. A ballot that comes with a note from an officer explaining his ship was not able to postmark his ballot, but that he had voted on time--and indeed it had arrived in time--is thrown out, because it has no postmark.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That really sounds like people not following procedure doesn't it? How bout this?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They denied a number of votes postmarked Queens NY, ballots that were clearly ordered from     overseas, clearly returned from overseas, and verified by the Post Office that DOD uses the Queens post office to handle overseas mail, were denied because it didn't say APO.

Using the 5-page memo to challenge and get thrown out legally done ballots is ok, I suppose. Who cares that these men and women actually are defending our country and not just getting shepherded around long cold battle sites? I guess they don't deserve the same consideration that 'pregnant' or dimpled chads got.</font><P><center><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~ladylupa/_uimages/sig2.jpg></center><P><i></i></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=95%><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.showMessage?topicID=902.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1><< Prev Topic</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.showMessage?topicID=900.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Next Topic >></FONT></A> </TD></TR></TABLE><BR><TABLE WIDTH=95% BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=898.topic&index=27><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.threadControl?topicID=898.topic><IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif BORDER=0 ALT="Topic Control Image"></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic Commands (Moderator only)</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=898.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Subscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to receive email notification of replies</FONT><BR><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=898.topic><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Unsubscribe</FONT></A>  <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</FONT><BR></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=CENTER><BR><FORM ACTION=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum METHOD=POST><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2>Jump to: </FONT><SELECT NAME=forumName><OPTION VALUE=namelesstavernthenamelessserverboardrules>The Nameless Server Board Rules<OPTION VALUE=namelesstavernfrm9>Guild Links<OPTION VALUE=namelesstaverngeneraldiscussion>General Discussion<OPTION VALUE=namelesstavernfrm12>Nameless Polls<OPTION VALUE=namelesstaverndragonsandplanes>Dragons and Planes<OPTION VALUE=namelesstavernfrm11>Retirement Community<OPTION VALUE=namelesstaverntradingpost>Trading Post<OPTION VALUE=namelesstavernthenamelessroleplay>The Nameless Roleplay <OPTION VALUE=namelesstavernrantsandflames>Rants and Flames<OPTION VALUE=namelesstavernfrm8>Nameless Guild Leaders Lounge</SELECT><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE=Go></FORM></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><CENTER><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#333333>- </FONT><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>The Nameless Tavern</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#333333> - </FONT><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Rants and Flames</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#333333> - </FONT></B></CENTER><P><BR><CENTER><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.free-irewards.com/cgi-bin/ezboard/games.html?id=ouuIcESe" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/banners/iRewards120x30-08.gif"></a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=7279965&siteid=33932331&bfpage=compactiongames" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
