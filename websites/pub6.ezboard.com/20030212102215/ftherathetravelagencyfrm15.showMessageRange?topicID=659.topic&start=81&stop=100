<br>
I've actually been in Tindi for quite some time. In fact, I've only been in three guilds since I started playing EQ in Beta 3. In beta I helped debug the guild system as a member of the first guild ever in EQ (BCK). Little history lessen for ya there. After the game went gold my M59 guild reorganized in EQ then later joined forces with another largely M59 player based guild call Tindi Losi.<br>
<br>
I like to reiterate that I feel Tindi is a great and good guild. I've always been proud to be member and IMHO a good member. I wouldn't have ANY of the ubah gear I have today if I wasn't a part of it. But whoever said I /gr'd over the willsapper issue was dead wrong. I never said that and it's simple not true.<br>
<br>
I'd like to take a few seconds to share some insight as to what happened on this whole Vaniki/willsaper thing. First, when I logged in and saw that he was up there were only 3 warriors, including myself, online and the other two who were online and playing already had the item. So, I guess it's not unreasonable to think that I would have a pretty good chance of being awarded this item. By the time I arrived at DN there were 10 warriors on. Second, right before we engaged the mob I was sent a telling stating there were other people who needed the item more than I did. And my comment was something to the effect, &quot;Well, it's not the first I spotted him up and wasn't awarded the item.&quot; And that is true, btw.<br>
<br>
Now, all that being said, I just like to add my own little bit flame. If you think I&quot;m a loot whore you can @#%$ straight off. If you think I've gotten items I didn't deserve you can @#%$ straight off as well. I have no idea what is being said about me on the tindi boards? Probably not nice things by people who don't know me or know very little about me. If you do have access to that board, and it's not too much trouble, could you post some of my comments there. I really don't like getting flamed in tells by people who don't have a @#%$ clue. Thanks.<br>

QUOTE FROM Phytir below<br>
<br>
&quot;First off, I'd like to say I would have never posted anything about this myself. Second, this is history so let it pass and move this out of general please. Third, Tindi is a good and great guild and I've enjoyed the time I spent there. Finally, I've had a toon in DN for well over 3 months checking for Vaniki every single time I log in and nobody would have gotten the Willsapper if I hadn't mentioned he was up. Enuff said.<br>

1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This post was not started by phytir, it was started by a friend of his, Wilo, and is making phytir look bad here.<br>
2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Camping and checking on a mob are 2 different things.  IMHO camping a mob is sitting in the camp for hrs upon hrs waiting for the mob to spawn, Checking a spawn takes only popping in to his spawn (vaniki isn't up) camping the toon, logging off and going about your business.<br>
3<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Because I don't have access to the attendance, I do have to use my EQ logs for raid attendance, and in the past month I have seen phytir's name listed LESS than 10 times, so in saying he checks for vaniki everytime he logs on is not saying alot. (my logs are extensive as I have apprx 94% attendance for the past 100 raids. I personally don't know the reason why phytir has been away from EQ.<br>
4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  To say that Tindi would not have gotten Vaniki had it not been for Phytir spotting him is not true. I am sure that guilds have toons camped at certain spawn all over Norrath and check for mobs continusly.<br>
5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Checking spawns and alerting the guild of a spawn does not automatically entitle you to the loot that drops. <br>
6<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I was on at the time this all happened and Wilo's concerns about his friend phytir was not the big issue at the time.  The issue Wilo has was with WILO and Zewt, something about the boards.<br>
7<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Phytir was always very nice to me and I really hated to see him leave, I beleive that he left only because his friend Wilo left and I am sad about that. :-(<br>
<br>
Note to WILO:<br>
<br>
Wilo, I have to say, I think you were out of line by posting this on flame, you have not only brought down yourself but you have made your friend Phytir look bad.  Phytir had nothing to do with this post. I am sorry for phytir that you put him in the middle of flame central.  Please in the future let your friends speak for themselves. <br>

&quot;it's a 1hs weap that has a slow componant that is a nice item for warriors to have because of the taunt factor. For such an item, getting one isn't so much an improvement on some warrior's gear (as there are other weaps out there that may be better, but I'm not a warrior so don't hold me to that), but rather it is an improvement on the guild's gear as a whole.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
If you didn't say slow component, I would have thought you were talking about the Warrior Epic or Blade of Carnage, since they do that job as they were intended, very well.  <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'm not on anyone's side here, and but I will state the facts... Noble Blade, showed up in DN to kill *Zlandicar* and we had noticed Tindi was there just earlier too.<br>
[Thu Aug 01 03:01:20 2002] (ranger00) tells the guild, 'just to confirm, Zland's up, but no bonus Vaniki down there'<br>
[Thu Aug 01 03:01:29 2002] (warrior00) tells the guild, 'Tindi got Vaniki earlier'<br>
<br>
So, stating the obvious:<br>
If Phytir, or whoever in Tindi, had NOT told you that Vaniki was up, we would have most likely killed him instead.<br>

You might want to look a little closer to home for the &quot;lowbiness&quot; that you will surely find present there. Perhaps look in a mirror, or at some of your own guild officers.<br>

<br>
Quote by Corso: &quot;Im not sure if you all grazed over it or not, but the guy was gone for months playing NWN and other games to that nature. If a ghost member just came back into your guild, demanding this uber loot, no guarantee that he will be back for another few months, does that seem as a good decision for a guild as a whole to make to better itself?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes appearantly it does look like there is a much deeper story to this than what was originally posted by the thread starter. But from the sound of your post Corso, it sounds like there is a big trust issue. Phytir trusted his own guild, and helped out by pointing out that Vaniki was up, and wanted assistance with taking him down. What did he get in return? Maybe he has gotten alot out of Tindi in the past and Zewt and the others feel that this loot decision was justified. I have no idea, and its none of my business to begin with.<br>
<br>
But, If you don't take the time to get to know your potential guildmates before you invite them into your guild and find out what kind of people you are dealing with behind the screen, then this sort of thing will happen to you more and more in the future and dirty up your guild name in the process. <br>
<br>
Without trust, friendship, and helping one-another... you end up just being another uber smash-and-dash guild. Trust is built, the other 2 will come in time. The point is, don't invite people into your guild you don't trust to begin with, then there will be more general trust to pass around in the long run.<br>
<br>
So when someone says, &quot;I am done with NWN and here to stay&quot;... You'll actually believe them, instead of second guessing them, and denying them loot they just helped you get.<br>

Why bother your &quot;Divine Selves&quot; with a weapon such as a willsapper? <p><p align="center"><map name="FPMap0"><area href="http://webbear.adsl.dk/membersprofile.asp?charname=Tzuten&" coords="0, 1, 442, 136" shape="rect"></map><img border="0" src="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz-sig.jpg" usemap="#FPMap0" width="442" height="136"></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uleilaya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leilaya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(8/3/02 3:23:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tindi Losi I'm sad</span><hr size=1> Am I the only one that noticed the fact that Dadany's response was a generic statement, that was more than likely a cut and pasted from somewhere? <br>

I truly have no opinion on this matter other than, if I was in Tindi Losi, I would be disappointed in Zewt's post, and ask him/her/it to make a public apology. That's the most idiotic, asinine post I've ever seen on these boards. Including, might I add, some of the really outlandish ones my fellow buckethead Dwallyn has made..

&quot;high end&quot; item makes it any different from any other item in the game that <br>
*means* something to the person wishing to own it. <br>
<br>
Stats and all that stuff aside, I think you went a bit over the top with <br>
your assesment of who should make comments and who shouldnt, based on their <br>
in game experiences. You've cleared NToV....so what. You've done AoW <br>
etc.....so what. <br>
<br>
Hell..CoN hasnt done a helluva lot...but we've been here as long...if not <br>
longer than Tindi....so I'm not entitled to offer an opinion I gather? My <br>
time in game wouldnt matter one whit? <br>
<br>
It's prima donna attitudes such as this that make for bad mojo.....take a <br>
breath, relax...and just ignore those you dont wish to hear from....but at <br>
least acknowledge the fact that they have the right to voice their opinions <p>Karas LightStrider

<br>
Not everyone plays the game to only make friends, chat while sitting in an exp zone and raid occasionally. This is why players are usually classified as casual and power gamers. This is not to say that powergamers only play to be the best because of course you need to have a guild backing you, and you backing it. Power gamers just tend to strive to achieve more, faster, and attempt to push the limits of the game.<br>
<br>
Tindi'Losi has a mix of both players but their schedule leans more towards a &quot;power gamer&quot; style of play, consisting of a large amount of raiding requiring full guild participation. This means if you are online, you are there to help the guild in achieving a common goal, not off doing your own thing.<br>
<br>
Guilds in this category aren't any better then other guilds comprised of casual players who may not always have committments to a vigorous raiding agenda, it's just that they are on 2 different gaming levels and thus operate a lot more differently then many would think.<br>
<br>
What people are trying to say is that the casual gamer, in a smaller guild which doesn't raid end-game encounters, should not be telling a power gamer how to play. It would work the other way of also of course, you wouldn't want a someone telling you that your guild should exp grind faster or raid more and boot people who don't want to raid.  It would sound stupid to you.<br>
<br>
Everything you write here is nothing but an uneducated opinion unless you have experienced how an &quot;end-game guild&quot; operates.<br>
<br>
Tindi members aren't trying to say that casual players are useless newbs and don't understand anything about EQ, they are just saying that you are basing your judgements from a much different perspective and to Tindi, as a raiding guild, they don't apply.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As for flaming Tindi about never being first, you're wrong Alistriwin. Tindi'Losi was the first guild SERVER-wide to kill the Arch Lich in Ssrae, after which Verant nerfed the encounter because they felt it was too difficult.  I was there for that, and it was one hell of a fight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Tindi has a few other Rathe firsts such as Dozekar the Cursed and the others I can't recall atm. This may, or may not mean much to the casual player, but to Tindi these were great experiences where massive amounts of hard work, patience and persistance paid off.<br>
<br>
I joined Tindi back before they broke from Foundation Rathe, the alliance...not the guild. The guild was at a point where we had 1 level 60 and needed KEGs help to break and clear the Plane of Fear.  I still remember the 14 hour CR when we tried to do a west wall break in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . What I'm saying is that I (and the oldschool Tindi) have experienced both styles of gameplay, so when we say something about these types of situations we have experience to back up our decisions and views.  No I'm not saying that ALL casual players don't have this experience...so put away the matches and lets keep that flame off here kthx.<br>
<br>
Tindi has a system that works for them, I liked it and so does the majority of the guild. As a former officer of Tindi, I was able to see every aspect of how the system works. Those that do not like it have the option of trying to resolve their problems, or freely leaving. <br>
<br>
Unless you are a member, you have nothing to say.<br>
