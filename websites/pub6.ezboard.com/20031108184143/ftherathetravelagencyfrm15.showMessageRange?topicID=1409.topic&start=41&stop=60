if i was a member of c4 i would tell you. i have nothing to hide. why should i lie? i have no reason to. your trying to stop me from getting into a guild on a video game what does it matter to me? if i dont get in oh well life goes on. i am not gonna sit here and cry because i didnt get into x guild or y guild because you people think your right. you need to learn the facts before you talk shit. VoF knows where i was when the events took place, VoF knows i had no part in the Sev kill, VoF also knows i am not a member of c4. so press the subject all you want cause you dont know the facts.<br>
<br>
<br>
if i was a member of c4 i would know what their chat channel is. wich i had no idea what it is. i was a member of c4 dont you think i would have more fucking posts then the 2 i have on there after the events took place? noooo you wouldnt think that because that would make friggin sense. did i ever get asked if i would join c4? yeah before i applied to SoTe over a month ago i was asked &quot; why join a guild? just join my no name guild and we will gank rot mobs&quot;, and what did i say? no thanks i would rather go see more of the game, and it was left at that. so until you can find a rule i broke or FACTS good solid facts that i am a member c4 keep talking crap and making yourself look like idiots but its already starting to get old. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=juryiel>Juryiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 9:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1409.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: you got a problem??!!?!?!</span><hr size=1> Hi, I've known Hilje for a long ass time, and he's a cool guy.

Oh NOZ! I like a so-called &quot;member of C4&quot; (which he isn't btw) but dislike another.  What's the RTA supposed to do with me?<br>
<br>
How far are you guys planning to extend this association chain?  This is getting rediculous.  All hilje did was post some shit.  THere's plenty of things about the RTA that I don't like myself.  I want to go solo (or try to) those one group mobs so bad, but RTA says no and I stfu and do what they say.  So even if Hilje does not find anything wrong with what C4 did from his own perspective, that does not mean that he would also break the rules.  You don't have to agree with the rules, just follow them, and Hilje is doing that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nyca>Nyca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Singing Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 2149<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 10:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1409.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/slllyonec/EZemo/LeahHarp2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: you got a problem??!!?!?!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So if someone flames you here does that make it right to fuck with them in game?

Hillje, I like you, and yoru a good Ranger, but your trouble. And as you can see, as it's unfolded, what have you done? Not the right hting obviosly. You ahve this lame ass excuse your sticking up for your friends to try and cover your ass. <br>
<br>
That doesn't wash. When your friends do stupid shit, it's just as stupid to cheer them, then say *well, there my friends*. That's like letting your best friend borrow a gun, knowing he's going to rob a convienience store. Hey, you weren't there right? Hey, he's your best friend!!!! Shit, can't not give him a gun!!<br>
<br>
Stupid... supporting, and cheering your friends on when they do stupid shit, is not being a friend. And it's just as stupid... And it's even more stupid, that the number of times this has been pointed out to you, yet you still stick behind the &quot;but I'd do anything for my friends&quot;. Do the right thing for your friends, tell them there being fucking morons and to get there shit together. Be an example.<br>

So what? What is your fucking point moron? Tons of other people agitate people all day long in FC and they get no punishment, they aren't the targets of your holier than dog shit ire.

No, he started denying it after people pronounced him guilty by association. When you idiots tried to put him at the crime scene with a bloody knife in his hand.<br>

<br>
And I never said the shit he said wasn't stupid or wrong. I just don't damn my friends to hell for having a different, albeit retarded, opinion. You can have a different opinion from the majority and still function. I'll point to the Lukieb quotes again as proof. EVERY guild, from BoTS down the list to the lowest level guild, has people in it that don't agree with the RTA and lots of them have even spoken out about it here in FC........OHSIT! THE WORLD IS GONNA END!!.....It is just an opinion, on 1 subject reguardless of how retarded it comes out when the person tries to convey that opinion it is still just that an opinion. He never acted on it (he did act a fool on the boards but that is not a crime), that is what seperates him from the other ones. Flame him here all you want, hell, he deserves it and I would watch and laugh, but trying to take your vigilanty justisce to his app and fucking with his game play is so wrong and sickening.<br>
<br>
Lukieb your the fucking moron for not figuring out that all I was doing was pointing out that YOU yourself have problems with the RTA and yet you don't break the rules. I used you as an example because you are the most vocal figure right now on the subject across the board, and I figured it would grab attention and point out a flaw in this witch hunt. It wasn't meant as a knock on you even though it came out that way, it was actually meant as a compliment. Sorry it didn't come out that way I was very angry at the time and let that get the better of me.<br>

How much trouble did he cause in SoTE? I was guilded with him for a long time in Wild Knights and he never once caused a problem. I'm sure someone who was in or is in AIF can back me up when I say he didn't cause any problems there. We had several people in SoTE that disliked the rots, don't see you posting that on their apps. He did nothing, absolutly nothing, that gives you the right to fuck with his app.<br>

No actually that is called facilitating.<br>
<br>
That is wrong and bad Hillje was totally unaware of what happened till he saw it here. He had nothing to do with it and you can't really blame someone for stating their oppinion. (least not in my country I'm not sure if they have EQ in those 3rd world dictatorships where people get the kinda shit hillje is just by assication). <br>
<br>
I've seen several people state that although they think what I did was wrong they think that people that aren't guilded should have a chance at Rot mobs (Gneiss, Jury, Baysayer, others) quick quick lets black list them and ruin the game for them since they must be sympathizers...... and there really isn't much ya can do it me no maker how much ya'd like to think ya can. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alairneverlevel>Alair Neverlevel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 3:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1409.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.mchsi.com/~j.hill/saxeyblue2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: you got a problem??!!?!?!</span><hr size=1> i wanna duel someone <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rikko1>Rikko1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/11/03 3:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1409.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: you got a problem??!!?!?!</span><hr size=1> im staying away from you Alair. i think you regen faster than i can hit you :X<br>

the rest i chalk up to inbreeding, karasu at least actually believes that he is a ranger in RL, and that this is some holy crusader. he doesnt need blacklisted, he needs therapy<br>

<br>
Hillje, some guilds have closed application system where no one can see their applicants.<br>
<br>
Some guilds have open applicant sections, where everyone will know who is applying.<br>
<br>
I personally prefer the open system, the advantage to it is if there is a potential problem with an applicant you can find out before that person is wearing your guild tag.<br>
<br>
Now there are diplomatic ways of warning a guild of something you have first hand knowledge of and <br>
non-diplomatic ways.<br>
<br>
But more important is the applicants reaction. <br>
<br>
I would think your flame here, probably hurt you more than anything someone posted on your application.<br>
