DAOC is a direct threat to EQ, and its subscriber base, because everything points to it being everything EQ has, only bigger and better. And undoubtedly a friendly CS ;p<br>
<br>
Shadowbane is looking at attracting the more hard core power gaming pvp crowd. The old guilds that were pvp dominant in UO and took active part in the dread wars, and then left when that system was replaced. As well as people looking for a more down and dirty pvp game.<br>
<br>
While both have said, they are focusing on pvp as a central pillar to their success, I see DAOC as a more detached style of pvp. Through their planned use of realm vs realm conflict, DAOC will be a friendlier environment. In contrast, all of the very old pkilling and pvp guilds like KAAOS, TheMercs, Covetous Crew, SIN, SOB, DDH and others have already announced their intentions to play shadowbane due to the more free for all aspect of the game. Guilds can certainly gain more individual power and glory in a game like Shadowbane.<br>
<br>
The two games arrival could be fairly close. DAOC appears to be very stable in its development, whereas rumors swirl around Shadowbane, and nobody is able to get a straight answer out of wolfpack. Wolfpack the company developing shadowbane is 100% privately owned, but rumors suggest that GodGames their publisher has recently dropped them. Production will go forward as SB while in a more limited beta at the moment certainly appears to be further along than DAOC.<br>
<br>
The financial situation of SB is also uncertain, several independantly wealthy people have offered to assist in SB's funding if it was needed, all have been turned down. In anycase, the only cloud looming in SB's future at the moment would appear to be perhaps finding a new publisher.<br>
<br>
Ultimate Winner? Money wise DAOC. They are more secure, and are catering to the mass market. They undoubtedly will pick up a LARGE portion of EQ's subscriber base. Shadowbane is going after a niche market, which will also be lucrative. I think both games will grow over time untill the next couple of big games to come out. Shadowbane will attract a more hardened gamer, possibly many EQ vets who are tired of the same old same old monster bashing. While DAOC will certainly appeal more to true newbies to the genre, and die hard PVE players. I think it should also be noted, that DAOC's sudden popularity has got to be attributed largely to the cancellation of UO2.<br>
<br>
The amusing part is, seeing some of the planned changes to EQ in the next little while. Verant has been too secure in their basic one game show for the last 2 years, and has become a bit draconian.<br>

Great ideas, but 0 substance. They supposedly have 50 people on one internal server with nothing shown to anyone of any substance. <br>
<br>
DAOC actually has somewhat of a product, at least.A bit empty but it will be out in 6 to 8 months. Shadowbane won't see the light of day this year, if ever.<br>

It sucks ass but UO2 looked like the best of the lot, and now it probably won't ever see the light of day.</font><P><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=59620> Kyojitsu Tenkanho</a><BR>

<br>
You cannot play &quot;solo&quot; in terms of running around alone, doing your thing. Solo = Target<br>
<br>
Inevitably there forms a guild of people who get/got/will get bored with the PvE aspect, or downright nevr really care for it, and go PvP hardcore.... whats not a problem unless they decide to do what so many did: Random Pking.... just kill on sight.<br>
<br>
This again usually leads to a rather small base of newbies, cause they really dont like being killed every time they come out of the safe zones.<br>
<br>
PvP as main pillar is nice as long as there is either<br>
a) a way to hide (which isnt really atm)<br>
b) a server or two that dont allow it<br>
c) a game designed to be a kind of match all the way (like a FPS)<br>
<br>
Whats downright ugly is if you can kill people and get rewarded for it, with loot money exp.

They have no publisher.<br>
<br>
They have no beta, really. 50 people on one server is an ALPHA, not a beta, whatever Wolfpack calls it.<br>
<br>
Seeing how they will need to have a product and go through a Beta 1,2,3 AFTER they get out of alpha, not to mention they need someone to actually agree to distribute the game in the US, I think it's safe to say right now SB is Vaporware.<br>
<br>
I think SB sounds the best of all the games out there. Unfortunately I don't think it will be released before 2002.<br>

They also have an independant european publisher.<br>
<br>
Asherons Call went into development in 95 I believe. Ultima went into development, late 95. Wolfpack is a small company, and thus has less manhours to burn per day. <br>
<br>
Ive been following shadowbane since 98, back then we thought it was vapor. And 50 testers is not much different than DAOC sorry to say. Ive played days in the last phase, where there were 11 people on in primetime.<br>
<br>
Unsubstantiated rumors that godgames dropped wolfpack are around. But honestly, publishers just press the CD's and distribute them. I don't think finding a publisher is that big of a deal.<br>
<br>
Now let me ask you a question. How many people were in the first phases of DAOC? Or Asherons Call? Or EQ, or UO? Less than 100 in each instance. I know, I was there for all of them. Shadowbane may be coming along slower than what some people, myself and my guild included would like to see. But if anything, DAOC is more alpha like right now. It reminds me of the UO alpha test. More than 90% of the stuff you see now in DAOC is going to be changed come final, the entire game is not being tested. Just bits and pieces as they work it all into place.<br>
<br>
In regards to the guy who said serious pvpers tend to realize you cannot pvp well solo, I'd have to disagree. Going solo in a game with a sound pvp system, that rewards knowledge and skill is what the serious pvpers are looking forward to. Fighting 5-10 on 1 or 2 in UO, fighting 10 on 1 in asherons call beta and final on darktide fighting 1 on 10-15 in DarkSunOnline (first generation onlinerpg with turnbased combat), (EQ is the worst pvp game ive even had the displeasure of playing ;p) Were things I enjoyed, and my compatriots and peers enjoyed as well. A guild mate of mine, plays this server who goes by the name Indigo in my guild, something else here, was argueably the best duelist in UO ever. I watched him take on 5-10 people solo many times, not against noobs, but against the self proclaimed anti pk's of Atlantic in its glory days. Need I mention he was also undefeated in duels against guilds like Covetous Crew and The Pluggers, who are in the upper echelon, the elite of the elite in the world of pvp.<br>

Regardless of the Take Two takeover of GODgames, there is a reason SB was dropped.<br>
<br>
Wolfpack have admitted they have 50 people, all internal employees or European business partner types who are the only ones presently testing their one server. An internal closed one server first build running their game. In other words, an alpha.<br>
<br>
Yep, I beta'ed UO, EQ, and AC. The big difference between those three products and the companies who made them is they all were/are reputable companies with timelines, project management, and reputations. <br>
<br>
Wolfpack in my opinion has none of the above. They are merely existing right now on leaks regarding their product and dollars trickling in from European partners.<br>
<br>
Believe what you want, but I personally do not think Shadowbane will be out before 2002. I seriously doubt it will be out in the next year, even. <br>

<br>
Most people with half a brain half suspected God HAD dropped them especially when God removed all the SB content from their pages.<br>
<br>
As for the testers, thats nothing we didnt know. However I think you got one thing mixed up. The euro's are business associates yes. Many of the American testers are friends/personal aquantences of wolfpack members. <br>
<br>
Yes, it's pretty shitty of them to put guilds like mine and others who did alot to popularize SB before they even advertised themselves, out.<br>
<br>
I don't think you are going to get any arguements over the way SB has handled all this. Hell, I am in personal contact with warden, and since Jan 99, ive been getting emails from him every 3-6 months untill last summer saying Beta in a few months. <br>
<br>
They have been internally testing like they are now for quite some time I do believe. But alot of the board gimps who sit around and kiss ass 24/7 were getting restless for an &quot;official&quot; beta. So wolfpack gave them a beta. Its a running joke in my circle that wolfpack just did this to get them to think the ball is rolling. <br>
<br>
I think the big question will be after &quot;phase 2&quot; when they open the beta up to 500 people. When that happens is another story...<br>
<br>
My personal opinion as to why God dropped wolfpack is. Greed, plain and simple, Wolfpack wants to get this sucker out the door and start getting fat from as much of the 10-15 dollars per month the subscriptions will bringas possible. God was having to front all the money, and probably with a tiny promise of the subscription share.<br>
<br>
Their beta server is a good server by all accounts. Their bandwidth is a DSL.<br>
<br>
Back in 98 when wolfpack first formed, one of our members who is rich to say the least did a checkup on them to see if it was legit. The original members of WP were all running an ISP wherever it was they were, I forget. It's possible thats still how they pay the bills I do not know. In anycase, while im sure SB will be a done game sooner rather than later, they are gonna need to make some sacrifices it would seem to launch it. I know right now them being 100% privately owned means that they do not have the bank to publish themselves, to get servers, etc etc.<br>

<br>
They are still not ready for a real beta after 3 years. They are not releasing info. Some believe this is to protect their secrets. I believe its because they have no content and they don't have much of a game, <br>
<br>
I've been following SB since it was announced. I have corresponded with a few folks from WP a while back. I think they have great idea's. What they don't have is product. I think they may even have scrapped their initial engine and started over. <br>
<br>
The testing and roll out of an MMORPG is similar. Its a matter of several upgraded betas leading to a release. UO did it. EQ did it. SB isn't close to testing, and again their alpha dev build being touted as a beta is hilarious. That alone should be an indicator of where they are. <br>
<br>
I believe they might start beta testing this game Christmas time, in the manner DAOC did three months ago. Maybe.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't hold your breath waiting on SB. I have been for years, and I've gotten to the point where I feel WP is marketing smoke. <br>

 Nice to see you again. Obviously you give a damn. You posted a reply. <br>
<br>
Being in SOME form of Beta means you are testing product. Meaning you HAVE product. SB doesn't have product yet. They have a few rumors and Screenshots. Thats it. <br>
<br>
This is different from being in Dev/conceptualization and not having product. Most IS shops run Development, Beta, production for rolling out product. MMORPGs run Dev, Alpha, more dev, alpha, beta 1, beta 2, final beta, etc, etc. <br>
<br>
Its simple enough even a 99 Cent Menu item from Taco Bell can understand it... Well, maybe not....<br>

a product?<br>
so you're saying DaoC isn't a product yet right?<br>
because it's been called 'EQ LITE' more than a few times in its CURRENT STAGE.<br>

I was following SB from about 2 years ago after my initial EQ start and was in awe about the ideas. Through 2 years of playing EQ(holy shit it has been that long) there really has not been that much let out about SB more then the 2 paragraph preview i read 2 years ago. Looking at DAoC pages(tons of them now) you can see what they plan on doing, are and have been doing through the development. The fanbase is huge and the game has very little in it so far. The fact they had 33,000 people apply to the beta in 1 weeks time, had almost no coverage in the media compared to other MMORPG's is amazing. The games dev team and president frequent the main boards and are really trying to make the best game everyone else wants(Whhaaa, no &quot;vision&quot;?)I would expect this huge genre where tons of games are being published to really get slimmed down, there are around 30 or so of these games being developed now, I would expect maybe 3-5 of them to actually go gold. DAoC will be one of those and probably the best one out there for awile, (AO is a bunch of trash, AC didn't do near what EQ did, UO was canned, SB is vaporware for the near future, Horizons still has awile if ever) The only one to come out and actually have some support will be camelot, the rest don't look like much if any progress is happening.</font><P><B>B A L D</B>

No arguments from me. I think AO is the only game out there in a true beta and releaseable soon. <br>
<br>
DAOC does have an engine, a test schedule, and a corporation pushing them. They also have a publisher and they are adding content rapidly. I think while they are 'lite' they are getting there.<br>
<br>
SB I think is still more in the engine/dev, and not yet in the content outside of conceptualization and initial implementaion.<br>
<br>
SB while having the best ideas out there, through being understaffed or whatever is much, much farther away. They have been in Dev over three years, and they still aren't even really releasing any info about the game, PVP, or the mechanics. <br>
<br>
It sucks since SB sounds so goddamn awesome. I'm just irritated since I have been following SB since 98 and they seem to still be far away from having even a 'lite' product out in beta, yet.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong, but seriously I doubt SB will be released in the next 12 months commercially.</font><P><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=59620> Kyojitsu Tenkanho</a><BR>
