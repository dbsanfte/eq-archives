One question that has always racked my brain... why does anything with int/wis always go to a caster? The only item I can think of with that much str that isn't dropped off an uber mob is the Sarnak Earring of Station which has 5 str. This has that PLUS 5 sta for those extra hps and decent resists. It also has see invis which is nice for anyone. Especially those whom can't cast it themselves...<br>
<br>
Overall, I think this is more of a melee item. That is just my opinion. Personally, I think you should try to get some blue diamond earrings for the resists. It's not like it's that hard to get over 200 wis/int without using your ears.<br>

I know Scoron well, and he didn't put that many points into int when he created that wizard. We joke about it sometimes. He has a hell of a time coming up with 200int actually.<br>
<br>
I agree with ya Scoron. Need before greed, as I've always understood and played is, is if you can use an item you get a chance at it, unless you want to be kind and decline your chance at it because you know someone else can use it more than you can. In this case, I know that you could have and would have used that earring, thus you SHOULD HAVE HAD A SHOT AT IT by the way that I've always understood &quot;need before greed&quot;. <br>
<br>
My advice buddy- establish loot policy the second you get in the group and actually &quot;define&quot; NBG to the group so they understand and so you don't get screwed. Or just don't group with these people anymore.<br>
<br>
Perfect need before greed situation that I remember Scoron - Tilian, Derrith, Chesare, Teews, me, and I think Qatol were in ToFS and a bard/cleric usable helmet dropped, as well as a bard/monk usable ring. Tilian knew that Chesare could use the helmet more than he could, so he just let Chesare have it. But Tilian could use the ring, so he rolled on it with Teews. Then a sorcerous bowl dropped and Derrith and I think Chesare (and myself) could have used it, but Derrith didn't like the neg cha hit and Chesare said he wouldn't use it, so they let me have it and wouldn't let the group roll on it, because noone else could use it. That in my mind is the way that need before greed should work. You got shafted buddy... I'm sorry. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000000">

This earring is hardly a caster only item.  You really need to get past the idea that because something has +int on it, its caster-exclusive.<br>
<br>
The warrior mentioned NBG thinking, at first, that only he and the rogue should roll on it.  However, when u expressed desire to wear it also, and when it was made clear the item was all/all, everyone decided to roll on it.<br>
<br>
The key word of course is &quot;roll&quot;.  You seemed to have left out that particular detail from your post.  The roll was out of 596, and the warrior rolled something over 500.  If i remember correctly, you rolled something low-100s.  It hardly matters though, the point is you rolled and lost.  The warrior won a fine replacement for his cougar claw earring.  <br>
<br>
I didn't give him the earring LOL.  It certainly wasn't mine to give even, I'm not sure how you got that idea in your head.  There were other items from which you could've had your pick.  But instead of being thankful for a good night of xp and loot, you decided to make some sarcastic remark about the warrior's 'greed' and gate out.  I hope everything that you said was worth it somehow, because you threw what respect we had for you out the window.<br>
<br>
Btw Scoron, I'll admit it was thoughtless of me to not give you the runes as they dropped.  For that, I apologize.  Most people speak up if they're interested in research components since many master looters destroy them or drop them on the ground.  The cleric spoke up, you did not.  You couldve gotten all the runes you wanted had you decided to open your mouth sometime during the 5 hours we were there.<br>
<br>
Thats all from me<br>

I'd use this. Good STR/STA and decent resists. Full time See Invis while worn I assume. No weight. Only trade it out when selling or on a Trak raid where I need PR/DR resists. Slight AC loss, but not drastic. Made up for with other bonuses in my opinion.<br>

I never put my 2 cents in about what class should get this item... ok, here's why it's meant for a pure int caster:<br>
<br>
1. Wizards have very little str. Grantid, we don't need it, but if you're a wizard who follows Sol Ro like I am, you get those amazing Sol Ro rings and take a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> -8 strength</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> hit on BOTH rings. This happens with several other pure int caster items too. Thus, some of us really need to make up for that str so we can merely carry the robes on our backs.<br>
<br>
2. We can cast see invis, true, but for some of the types of hunting we do having to cast see invis again on ourselves = death because we'll become un-invis and get waxed.<br>
<br>
3. The fire/cold resists are nice for casters, especially if they're unlucky and get caught under their own ae or if they're casted on by a mob. Remember, pure casters have less hp than tanks, thus we need all the help we can get to keep us alive. High resists are a must. Not all of us have the time to camp/sell/loot enough so we can buy blue diamond earrings or something like that.<br>
<br>
4. Sta- pure casters have little hp, as I've said before. Any extras to keep us from dying in 2 hits is a god send.<br>
<br>
5. Int- Pure casters should always maintain 200int. Sure, there are some 5+ int earrings out there, but not with resist and other stats we need. You may not know this but when Scoron made that wizard he did not put any points into int I think. He's sorely hurting in the int department, like 15-20 behind the average person. So basically all of his slots have to have int and resists or he has trouble topping 200.<br>
<br>
<br>
There, I've said my piece. I'm not sure what the whole situation was either... Scoron made it sound like he wasn't even allowed to roll on the item, and then Entaro makes it sound like he was. Either way I'll find out later... Scoron's fuse can pop as you saw, but not unless it's warrented from what I've seen. He's not 54 with 120+ days played for being a loot whore or a-hole... That time what spent helping me and other guildies and teaching us to be fair and give. So I can't possibly believe that he got mad for no reason... I'm curious as to what really happened. <p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000000">

Just because you CAN use an item because of race/class/diety doesn't mean you should get it. If no one WILL use the item, then EVERYONE should get to random for it, because EVERYONE will use it to sell or trade, and thus all have an equal need of it. <br>
<br>
If you go and trade or sell it, then it wasn't need before greed, and if you use the NBG argument to get it for selling or trading then it is nothing short of STEALING.  <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

<br>
NBG works great for class-specific Kunark armor.<br>
<br>
NBG works great on spell drops.<br>
<br>
NBG works well when class-specific weapons drop that are upgrades for the current group members. I pulled a Jarsath Trident last night and all agreed that the two warriors, who don't have a good piercer, should be the only ones to roll on in.<br>
<br>
NBG requires trust. I'll trust players to be honest about their loot intentions to use it. If they sell it before getting an upgrade, that's on their reputation. I've seen a few people abuse NBG and sell items and it comes back to haunt them when they try to get into guilds with no valid explanation for their actions. To me, it's easier to trust a stranger by using NBG than it is to trust a friend with my account info. (No one has Zaboo's info -- it's all me all the time baby)  <p>Zaboo "BIG BOO" Krusher<BR>

Usually the group follows suit.<br>

But if you see something drop and you automatically say &quot;WOW that's worth XXk plat&quot;, usually everyone's pockets begin to whine about what they could use the PLAT for.  They forget all about the ITEM that dropped.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my 2cp.<br>
<br>
From looking at this item, it appears to be just as useful for casters as melee.  P.S.  The effect is SEE INVISIBLE, so who really cares about that anyway... unless you're a melee prone to dueling a lot of Wizards.  /grin Bicrius <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugobbfromluclin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gobb from Luclin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/8/01 9:32:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need Before Greed &quot; BULL&quot;</span><hr size=1> Need before greed is theft, pure and simple.

I can't remember the last time I grouped with 5 strangers, so this has never really been an issue with me.  However, people do seem to overlook the word <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> need</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  I could care less who the item says can use it, if you're not going to use it, don't roll.  If somebody in the group is wearing crappier gear than you and really needs the item a lot more, don't roll.  Problem is, you can't extend that level of trust to a group of complete strangers; it's more or less why I group with friends and guildies only now.  Way less headache that way. <p><hr align="center" size="1">

Any time I join a new group, I always make sure NBG is established and understood before we do anything. If the group refuses, I will leave.<br>
<br>
Generally, my groups work pretty well and the NBG decisions are always totally fair because... well, I also happen to insist on being the ML. ; ) (The only way a cleric can guarantee their peridot costs are compensated is to ML themselves)<br>
<br>
If you want to be clear on what you mean by NBG, then you should talk about it before that item drops. If your really concerned about seeing an item that can drop in the area your going to being lottoed away because the group disagreed that the item fits you best, then you had better talk about it up front before it's too late.<br>
<br>
Generally, my own NBG policy, is if something drops and it is very clear and very obvious that even though many can use, it is clearly meant for one person or one class, then that's that. If something is more general but still more specific than all/all items that are good for everyone, then only those who would use it should roll. In all cases, someone will receive a NBG item only if they do need it, and by need it, I mean they would put it on and use it right now.<br>
<br>
It is also best to wait till the very end to distribute loot, to avoid giving someone something, only to have a much better item they'd rather have drop later. (No drop items excepted, of course)<br>
<br>
In the case of that specific item above, that earring looks nice enough and general enough, that I probably would have done the same thing that group apparently did, and just have everyone roll it at the end. Its great for melees, and its good for casters.<br>
<br>
Long story short, you had better make sure you agree with the loot policy before the group does anything. If the group doesnt talk about it at all before a RBG drops, then its way too late to cry NBG, at that point your at the mercy of the rest of the group. <p>Cayleu Starshine
