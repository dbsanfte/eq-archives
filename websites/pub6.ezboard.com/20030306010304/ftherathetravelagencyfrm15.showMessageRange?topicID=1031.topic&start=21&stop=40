I have your damn 14 BD's and your 2300 PP.  The only reason why I spent that plat was I had the plat on another toon.  The damn BD's were a joke!!  Well it just goes to show you that you cant play jokes on your so called &quot;friends&quot;.....  The reason for this late post is because I just found out about it when I logged in tonight (2/6/03 around 10 PM West coast time)and said hey to Allaa, and he starts being a prick.  Jesus Christ man, after all we have been through.  I really thought you had more common sense than that.  I can see Robert and Tiff thinking that, only because Robert and I have not been the best of buds.  But you Rob!  C'mon man.  Have we not joked before??  I have done nothing bad to you or anyone you know!  If you think I ripped off Robert, so be it.  We have had Login's and PW's for all of our accounts......  I mean, if I really wanted to rip you all off, dont you think I would have done it before now??  I have been playing with you all for what 2 years now????????  I am like at a lost for words here......  I mean I really did not think you would stup this low as to think I would EVER do such a f***ing thing!  Plus as you so politely mentioned, YES, you have helped me out in a time of need and I will never forget that.  But anyways, I really dont have anything else to say.<br>

What kind of a friend plays a practical joke like this? Clearly, your relationship wasn't at the level such that Allaa would assume this was a practical joke played on him by his buddy Staabin.<br>

But not to worry, Inkiesmithy will get his stuff back and I will never even consort with you all if that is what you want.  I dont have time to write all these reasons on why and how we joke with each other.  To tell the truth, if they thought I was being serious, they should have called me personnaly.

   If you were just playing a joke, which I was more than willing to give you the benifit of the doubt...here is mine and Staabin's (Morekik) conversation at 10pm-ish PST like he mentioned.  Notice the denial of any involvement to the bitter end.  Trying to cover tracks and see what he can hide.  I did these logs much more carefully...edited for guildchat and personal tells basically.  <br>

After that he logs, presumably to spend 3 hours coming up with some form of story for disaster recovery to post here.  Like Dovelyn said, if it was just a joke, why the shadyness.  You can 2box so you wouldn't have had to drop it, and camp in and out unless you were hiding something, trying to prevent any log of your toons trading with Inkiesmithy.  You have all of our phone numbers, why not a call?  No tells, hey bro, can I borrow some pp for SoS.  No e-mail to any of the 3 of us.  You STOLE the money and the bd's, got caught, and now you're trying to pick up the pieces...it ain't gonna work.  Red hands are hard to hide man.....   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therealdrache>TheRealDrache</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A great example of...<BR>

But just so people don't start to hate... Allaa, I APOLOGIZE that I thought there could be a possiblity that your logs were faked as a result of noticing inconsistencies in the text.<br>

   Yark and Malka, no worries.  I F'd it up when I was cleaning, and it just happend to be in a bad spot, that caused a really bad turn of events in a very serious matter.  For that I apoligize, and I'll be more careful in the future, but it is why we made sure Haldo got that screenshot.  Nobody was in the wrong for questioning it, for sure.  Hopefully you can see between the screenshot, the log from last night, and the posts that all doubt has been removed.  <br>

Log in on cleric to hear in guild chat &quot;OMG you are on line thank goodness...I have a corpse with less than 6 minutes left on the timer please hurry...I am going to lose level.&quot;<br>
Rush to the zone only to find the corpse in question is a rotting uber cleric armor. Everyone laughs including breathless cleric.<br>

Guild party in Oasis people siting on dock to heal and buff. mage runs in with sow way ahead of pet yelling SG to docks. Then sit and watch everyone jump up to watch for SG. Hey took me 10 minutes to get rid of all the damned summoned spiders. Noobs panic &lt;guild laughs&gt;<br>
<br>
Ok <br>

Stealing stuff from guildees and friends..no one laughing=not funny, even if you intended to give it back.
