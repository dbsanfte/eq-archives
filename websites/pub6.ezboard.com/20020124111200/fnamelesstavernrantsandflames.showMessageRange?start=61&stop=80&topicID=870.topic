Learning and memory are often correlated with cellular changes within the hippocampus, and drugs or environmental factors which affect learning and memory will thus often induce observable morphological changes in this structure. Like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) itself, many synthetic cannabinoids such as the CB-1 receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 will induce learning and memory changes. In the current study, we investigate whether or not these changes could be related to structural changes within the hippocampus. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected twice daily (12:00 and 0:00 h) subcutaneously with WIN 55,212-2 (2.0 mg/kg) in DMSO or DMSO for 21 days. On day 22, animals were perfused and stained immunochemically for the dendritic marker MAP-2, or with cresyl violet. Morphometric analysis showed dendritic rearrangement with increased staining of MAP-2 in CA3 and the lower blade of the dentate gyrus. However, a loss of staining was observed in CA1. Counting of cresyl violet stained sections showed an apparent increase in granule cell number in the lower blade of the dentate gyrus. This work shows the potential for cannabinoids to influence hippocampal morphology. The pattern of changes may be similar to that seen after ischemic or toxic damage, but may be opposite to changes seen in stress.<br>

Evidence has suggested that cannabinoids such as THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, cause deficits in motor control and the production of movement. However, the specific components of motor control that are affected by cannabinoids have yet to be identified. The present study used an operant beam-press paradigm with a force criterion to determine the effects of THC on different parts of the force-time trajectory. Seven rats were trained to press a beam with at least 50 g of force to receive a sugar solution. THC was injected, as was apomorphine (APO), a selective dopamine D(2)/D(1) receptor agonist that acts as an antagonist at low doses. Low doses of APO, which have been found to cause deficits in motor execution, were used as a control for the effects of THC. Average peak force of a given press, as well as rate of rise of force, were significantly lowered by THC, as well as by apomorphine. Past research suggests that deficits in the rate of rise of force that can be attributed to depletions of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway, as in the case of low doses of APO, reflect failures of motor unit recruitment rather than of motor memory. Similarities in the motor effects of THC and APO suggest that THC plays a role in recruitment and synchronization of motor neurons appropriate for a given task.<br>

THC does effect the brain and memory function, although exactly what it does and how it works is not known, people are working on it.  As for right now you can't really say it does or it doesn't but there are a lot of findings that lead to believe that pot is bad and has more then one negative effect.  I got those 2 abstracts from pub med, if you want to check it out yourself<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
look for THC.  There are tons of studies looking at how TBC works, what it does...  With this types of studies, mostly on animals it's hard to be sure the effects are the same on humans but it at least gives us an idea that there is are very real side effects to smoking pot.  Now nobody can really say 100% that it will have a certain effect on a certain person but you can't deny that there is a very strong possibility.  I have no problem with making pot legal but it's never a really good idea to mess with your brain chemistry.  This was the result of a 5 min search and I'm sure there are many more studies looking at different potential side effects<br>
<br>
<br>
And uggmo as for your reference to aspirin, yup that stuff is bad for you, as a matter of fact if it was a new drug, it would never make it to market because it has so many side effects.  <br>

It DOESN'T cause Cancer?  You have the medical research to back that up and therefore we should all smoke?&quot;  I'm sure that research is 100% acurate, cause there can be no flaw in research.  I think your biased research (YES BIAS) is similar to the butter vs margarine stories.  Margarine was better until the saturated fats caused worse problems.  Orbit gum was pulled off the shelf when found to cause cancer even though you had to chew 1,000,000 pieces.  Chicken is better than beef, just ask a cow.  Geesh!<br>
<br>
Please don't kid yourself - Pot is NOT good for you.  I'm not arguing against the legalization of pot, it's a weed.  A war on grass is plain stupid, unless it is deadly to our existance.  Pot is not.  Therefore it's a big waste of our tax payers money.<br>
<br>
But I'm not so naive as to listen to the crap you are pulling off websites and such to support your bogus statements.  I used the crap you're saying when I was 11 years old.  Everything you've posted is a counter attack on propoganda used by certain folks who didn't know anything about pot and made things up.  WELL TOO LATE!  Their propoganda worked and we're still at war.<br>
<br>
Truth is pot is a depressant.  It slows you down and NEVER speeds anyone up.  That's ridilin or speed.  It doesn't maintain any level except further relaxation.  Unless you are lacing your pot with something.  (Then be careful).  <br>
<br>
Stop the madness - Smoking anything is bad for you.  Lungs DON'T work better with smoke residue building on them.  Use your friggin common sense.  <br>

<br>
The second one talks about THC hurting motor control<br>
<br>
again both of these studies are from mice and could not be true for humains but they do lead people to believe that THC is bad for your brain.  <br>

Crogon,  I'll argue this til I'm blue in the face - (And still wouldn't become a Maple Leaf fan).<br>
<br>
If you are getting stimulant or hallucination effects from your weed then it is laced or sprayed with chemicals that alter the high.  Anyone who has ever OD'd on pot had it laced.  People don't OD on pot they fall asleep.  <br>
<br>
There are variations of pot that are grown hydroplonic and so forth, but they use chemicals and such to grow.  I'm talking pot, not hash or oils or any other THC product.<br>
<br>
I would be doubly worried about the affects of unknown chemicals in pot.  This is the reason tobacco company's are losing big lawsuits.  They chemically altered the tobacco to make it more addictive and didn't tell anyone about it.  People like to know what they are smoking or eating or generally putting in their bodies.<br>

Nowhere does it mention the word depressant (I'd type out the whole thing, but it is 2 pages long).  BTW, under alcohol, it does say that it is a cns depressant in sufficient quantities.  Basically, all it says about marijuana/ marihuana is it may do this, or it may do that, but they don't really know.<br>
<br>
Of course, a lot of the reason they don't know is that because of it being a schedule 1 drug, it is very difficult to get permission to study its effects, and/or medical use.  Many of those who have gotten permission to study it have had a clear anti-pot agenda, so much of the research that has been done is really suspect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujaes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jaes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fruitloop</span><br>  Posts: 233<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/01 10:18:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=870.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Snero was stating how marijuana effected memory and coordination.

<br>
Also, those studies that Snero quoted were concerned with the immediate effects that THC has on the body. People tend to cite these sorts of findings, fail to realize this ambiguity, and confuse the results with long term effects. No one would doubt that learning (and memory) processes are affected by the presence of THC after smoking a bowl. And certainly no one would doubt that whilest under the influence they would experience a lack of motor coordination. But this doesn't prove that these effects will still be present a few hours later, the next day, or a month later.<br>
<br>
The same is true of alcohol. Almost everyone who has ever gone out and gotten pissed has woken up the next morning with holes in their memory. &quot;What happened last night? Who is this girl in my bed? Why do I have a tattoo of a vietnamese whore on my inner thigh?&quot;. That dizzyness that you feel after your eight vodka shot makes it pretty difficult to lift your arm and take your ninth doesn't it? But we all feel fine after the hangover passes. We resume our normal social duties and return to our acceptable places in the world without a hitch.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhammeriztinkertrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hammeriz Tinkertrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#333333>(4/27/01 10:26:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fnamelesstavernrantsandflames.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=870.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hi i like weed</span><hr size=1> Frodo, you cant say that weed doesnt cause stimulation and hallucinations if you've never tried it.  IT DOES cause stimulation because when im on weed my mind is sometimes going a million miles an hour and sometimes it's so chill.  Granted, my numbers on how much to smoke were guesstimated but I thought of it and made up a formula for how to find out.  Also i heard that on a PBS special about how the drug war is tearing families apart.  personally, weed has never been a hallucinogen for me even though i swear colors and people seem so much more alive when im doing it and it CAN be a stimulant cause some of the most tense/fun/exciting situations were when i was on weed and i dont think id have the same feeling if i were off of it.  I'm not trying to say &quot;everyone jump on the bandwagon&quot; im sayin gmake a decision for yourself and not to mention taking weed is a lot less of a risk than stuff we go through day to day.  Don't say weed is some huge awful risk because it really isnt.  Also dont say it is a gateway drug because only 25% of marijuana users go onto harder drugs and believe me this is true and as soon as i get ahold of my friend bobby ill tell you the site it's off of (Stabbath can back me on this - Bobby's like a weed genius hehehe).

What you fail to understand is that if your mind is working a million miles an hour on pot then it would work a lot quicker off it.  That means you'd figure things out a little quicker, cause your minds eye is working a little clearer.<br>
<br>
That doesn't take away from the fact that you enjoy doing certain things while high, rather than not.  You share a bond with certain people because you all get high.  These people are pretty cool, so you do exciting stuff with them.  That doesn't mean much except, you rarely try to enjoy those things without being high.  Truth is you and your friends just love being high.  So what, that's life?  Would they still be your friends if you didn't?<br>
<br>
That doesn't change the fact that it's bad for you.  Any smoking is.  As I said before, sucking in gaseous fumes of smoke nullify's your senses and causes your defense systems to react.  If your body was fighting some other problem (like a cold) then it's defenses just got weaker.  <br>
<br>
I'm not denying your right to smoke, or condemning it.  I'm simply saying, don't fool yourself into thinking pot is not harmful.  It's called denial.  I quit smoking for no other reason than it was time to grow up for me.  I've learned to live life at its fullest without smoking.  And people who don't get high are just as cool as those who do.  Now I have lot's of friends in both realms.<br>
<br>
Fact is, legalizing marijuana has nothing to do with 90% of the posts here.  It has everything to do with business and the fact that people getting high can do so whether it be legal or not.  So what are we fighting?  Our taxes are being spent on fighting agains a weed.  Doesn't sound right to me.  If it is going to be fought and won, it needs to be fought on a logical financial end.<br>

I don't agree with this at all. One of the primary things I enjoy about marijuana is the ability it gives to FOCUS entirely upon one thing without getting distracted by outside influences.<br>

My thinking is clearer, more directed and much more creative when smoking then when not smoking.<br>

This paragraph is one big fat assumption. You don't know him and you don't know me and you have no idea what we do, what we don't do, why we have the friends we have etc.<br>

I have no problem with your attempts to get Hammer to focus himself and use facts and real arguements but you need to lead by example.
