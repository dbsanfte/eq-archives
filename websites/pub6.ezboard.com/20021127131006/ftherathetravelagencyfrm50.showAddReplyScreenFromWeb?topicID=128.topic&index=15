I am a member of Shadows of Yamabushi, and am one of the main people saying here that the door DOES affect agro.  It has been my experience on more servers than just that rathe that this is true, and yes, I have done testing to support this, thus my above scenario.<br>
<br>
I agree with the opinions of most of the people who have posted between my last post and this one.  There is TOO MUCH of a coincidence with mobs agroing for &quot;no apparent reason&quot; when the door is opened.<br>
<br>
Oh and...Shadows of Yamabushi does not bring KoS people to our HoT farming sessions either.  We did once, learned from our mistake, and now bring only non-KoS people.  So that is not the issue.  The door opening is the ONLY variable, with the exception of possible shoddy programming of the walls as described above.  And even in this scenario, the hub mobs have only attacked us for &quot;no reason&quot; when the door was OPEN.<br>
<br>
Clearing up Kamlatir's post with his list of anti-asking guilds (Kenshiiro likes us to ask too, so for all intents and purposes, Yamabushi ASKS to open the door&gt; and reiterating his point,<br>

When NB was still CoV alligned and doing Doze raids regularly, opening the door was a standard practice.  We did it all the time.  I'd open to the door and walk through it whenever it got a little hairy with AE adds in the caster camp.  In my experience every single time we have ever gotten trained we spammed in /gu &quot;WHO DRAGGED A CORPSE?&quot; and every single time someone piped up &quot;All I did was drag soandso's corpse man, it's not like it's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> my</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fault we got trained&quot;.<br>
<br>
Point is, door opened, door closed, we never got trained unless someone dragged, someone KoS got too close, a mob got bashed too close to the door.<br>

<br>
Of course there is.  NPC's will open unlocked doors to get through them.  Here's what happens: A hub mob gets aggro, for whatever reason.  Mob runs around in circles because of bad pathing around doors and firepots, chain-aggroing all of his friends.  Mob paths to door.  Mob opens door.  Guild_Leader00 shouts, &quot;WHO OPENED THE DOOR?  WE'RE GONNA GET TRAINED!&quot;  Mob chain aggro's all his friends, guild gets trained.  Guild_Leader00 shouts, &quot;SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR?  DON'T OPEN IT!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> With the door closed you can fight mobs anywhere in HoT up to as close as about 3 feet from the door. This might vary with the type of mob.. but we have fought right up near the door many times without agro'ing the CoV dragons. The few times we did agro the CoV, it was when the mobs were believed to get too close to the door.<br>
<br>
With the door open, you can fight mobs anywhere in HoT up to about 10 feet (about halfway door-to-wall) from the door (yes, you can fight in los).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That's funny, because we've occasionally had mobs positioned badly, and fought them *right in front of the door* such that their tails were sticking through the door and out the other side, with no aggro.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There are wanderers in the hub, who get much closer to the door than the two guards on the side. (have been kos to CoV for the past several months, memory is a bit shakey here.)  IIRC, there are 2 guards in the hub, facing towards the center.  There are about 4 mobs who wander, and get much closer to the door than anyone else does, and more importantly, when he's approaching the door, is facing it.  You can have a mob, as Rogg said, right up against the door when there's no wanderers nearby and you won't get aggro, independant of the door being open or closed. (the door being opened at this time probably <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> would</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> cause aggro because the mob would likely be bashed through it and much closer to the static spawn guards)  However, a wanderer will eventually walk up 20-30 seconds later, be facing the door (increasing aggro range dramatically) chain aggro everything, open the door, and kill everyone, resulting in the guildleader the door open is the cause rather than the effect.<br>
<br>
Someone made the comment along the lines of &quot;Doors block AE- I was standing outside the door to Doze's room while we were fighting him and the AE didn't hit me&quot; (can't find it for the life of me)  FYI- the stairs you were standing on block AE too, especially because of how short Doze is.  LoS in EQ is funky as hell.  You can be standing right next to a mob, especially in the presence of lots of corners and firepots and not be hit with AE when you're in full sight of him.  You can be standing behind a corner and be hit by AE when none of the 10+ clerics standing next to you got hit. <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

None of the above comments show positive proof, only conjecture. VI has a way of not using a consistent method to develop zones and content, why would we not believe the possibility exists that the way these doors are implemented might not be in conjunction with common standards?<br>
<br>
Try some experiments to determine the validity of the statements above. Sure, noone wants an entire raid party to die, so try it with one group or so, move the raid party to the hub.<br>
<br>
We know that Dragro and KoS agro are obvious deaths, so let's rule these out of the equation at the beginning and concentrate on the other three possibilities of death, LoS, proximity, and AE agros. The one outstanding item that affects these MAY or MAY NOT BE, the DOOR. So let's test the DOOR. <br>
<br>
Control factors for both tests: Make sure noone on your party is KoS or drags a corpse. Also, until the AE test (2), try to do without bard songs, jic, though this is relatively superfluous.<br>
<br>
TEST 1: This test will show the effects of LoS agro and Proximity agro on a NON-AE mob. HYPOTHESIS: The door discourages LoS and proximity agro, therefore, keeping the door closed during a fight is necessary to prevent death.<br>
<br>
   Step1: DOOR CLOSED, Pull non-AE mob to the foyer in front <br>
             of the door, to about 3 feet from the door. <br>
         Do Static mobs agro? If No, go to step 2. <br>
               If Yes, CONCLUSION: Proximity to mobs caused <br>
               agro, opening the Door (LoS) has no affect.<br>
         Does roaming mob (Zemm) agro? If No, go to step 2.  <br>
             If Yes, CONCLUSION: Proximity to mobs caused <br>
             agro, opening the Door (LoS) has no affect.<br>
   Step2: While mob is being attacked, OPEN the door.<br>
         Do Static mobs agro? If No, CONCLUSION: opening the <br>
             door (LoS) and Proximity have no affect. <br>
             If Yes, CONCLUSION: opening the door DOES<br>
             create LoS agro, Proximity has no affect.<br>
         Does roaming mob (Zemm) agro? If No, CONCLUSION: <br>
             opening the door has no affect on LoS and/or Prox. <br>
             If Yes, CONCLUSION: opening the door does <br>
             allow LoS agro or Proximity agro to take affect.<br>
<br>
Test2: This test will show the effects of an AE casting NPC on agro. HYPOTHESIS: The Door discourages the affects of AE beyond it's edge. For this test, simply repeat the steps in Test1 with an AE mob. The same conclusions can be drawn for this test as in Test1 with regards to the results of AE's affects.<br>
    NOTE: This test may be unnecessary depending on the <br>
    outcome of Test1.<br>
<br>
Put up or shut up. Get some logs and post them. <br>
<br>
One thing needs to be stressed. People have requested that you ask before opening the door. It's not that hard to do and saves much aggravation and hatred from forming. <br>

<br>
I have tested my theory that manually opening the door will cause AOE to agro hub mobs based on Line of Sight.  My scenario above was a *real* experiment and not a scenario.<br>
<br>
However, I mistakingly assumed that every time Hub mobs killed a raid party it was because a PLAYER manually opened the door.  I never considered the fact that mobs could be agroed *without* the door being agroed, and thus open the door themselves to come in for a killing spree.<br>
<br>
I will have to say that from my previous test, the AOE seems to be more apt to hitting the hub mobs with the door open.  Now...there is one variable that my test was missing, and I need this covered, but its not convenient to test this on a whim.<br>
<br>
The variable is the proximity of the wandering hob mobs to the HoT door when the door is initially opened.  <br>
<br>
Here is what I'm trying to say, but as of right now I can provide on &quot;conjecture&quot;:  I'm suggesting that yes, mobs can be agroed through the door, and that the door does not directly block AoE damage.   If one of these wandering hub mobs was close enough to the door, it could catch the AE, open the door, and kill the party via the pathing problems described above.<br>
<br>
} = hub<br>
- = blank space<br>
P = Player<br>
* = hub mob<br>
| = HoT door<br>
<br>
}------*--|    May result in Agro, while:<br>
<br>
}--*------|    May not.<br>
<br>
}------*--|P   If player had been hit by AOE, and was now agro'ly KoS to CoV+'s friend, he may agro mob through door.<br>
<br>
But here's something I never thought of before, what if:<br>
<br>
}--*-----P|  What if this Allied player was hit by the AoE through the door just before opening it, and was not KoS due to CoV+'s friend hitting him.  Perhaps mob close to the hub would agro on him as he went through the door, dragging the hub mobs into the fray.  That would *really* make it seem like him opening the door caused this, when it reality it was approaching the door and being hit by the AoE that caused it.<br>
<br>
Just some more &quot;conjecture&quot; for someone to test,<br>

Therefore, it all goes in a big circle back to the beginning DON'T OPEN THE DOOR. It's just that the statement has to be added: DON'T STAND IN FRONT OF THE DOOR.<br>
<br>
I have to add though, that when I was in there, I don't remember ever seeing anyone on the outside of the door to lend credence to that theory. So it must have been something inside happening, and NO, it wasn't KoS person or dragro. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uevilrulz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evilrulz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/18/02 6:52:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Experiment</span><hr size=1> Heres most of what I know about the door and AOE.  The door can be seen through for LoS on mobs, you can cast through the door and land spell SOMETIMES depending on the door and other weird things.  If a guild is in HoT fightin near the door the AE will &quot;hit&quot; everyone with in the range. HOWEVER if you are on the other side of the door (the hub), you may or may not recieve the skins sears message (AE landing) but you will never actually take the AE damage. (This can be entirely different if you place a mob right in the door when fightin then his AE can get through to others in the hub waiting)Same is true if say nag casts AE fear and your around the corner. the feared icon will be in your buff list but you are not actually feared.  There is 1 interesting thing about all this though. Should a mage or other pet class have a pet up, when thery are being ghosted by the AE it WILL i repeat WILL cause pet aggro.  Even though your pet hasnt taken any actual damage.  If ya dont think so park a pet on the oppostie side of the wall in HoT (the safe spot) and pull a wurm and fight it on the other side. The 1st AE and all future AEs will cause the pet to cruise out after the wurm. This im sure in some ways may not be a &quot;bug&quot; per say just a fault of programming.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/u3vi1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>3vi1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/20/02 7:53:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=128.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   My 2cp</span><hr size=1> Hey guys,<br>
<br>
Unless they changed something, doors don't truly exist server-side.  Remember the old bug where you are running at a locked door, go LD, log back in and find yourself on the other side?  They may have added some code to fix this, but I don't think mobs can detect if a door is open, or even locked.<br>
<br>
Door state drawing is all done client side.  If a mob comes through a door, the client animates it opening if it's unlocked.  If it's locked, the client knows not to draw it opening.<br>
<br>
But, the mobs will still walk through it, because as the server 'sees' things it doesn't even exist.  We've pulled the Servitor through the locked door in Griegs with AE when whatshisface was bugged, so I'm 100% sure the server doesn't care about them.<br>
<br>
On a similar note, there appear to be certain walls that are server side only too.  I was running east, along the south wall, in UP and went LD.  Lo and behold my surprise to find myself in the tunnel to Vex Thal, beyond the locked door.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR><HR><IMG src="http://www.eternaldusk.com/images/imgKaotiqa.gif" border=0><BR>

Don't think I didn't try.  After all, the other way was locked.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Unfortunately, there seems to be a second key-check when you zone.  If you have no key, it turns you 180 and zones you right back into UP.<br>

An ill positioned mob can be fought very close to the HOT (like rog said with their tails sticking out) without aggro'ing any of the mobs outside. If the door opens the +COV mobs will assist the wurms and cause a wipe&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Large models don't have anything to do with aggro range. All mobs have a common center, some slightly larger then others, and that's why you can't sit at the end of a wurms tail and hack at it. So...the wurm's tail sticking through a door/wall would have absolutely no effect on add aggro.<br>
<br>
Another point..ever notice that when a door opens there are usually people nearby who open it? Maybe they aggro the mobs on the otherside? If not then coincidentally dragging a corpse at the same time the door opens doesn't mean you got adds from the door.<br>
<br>
A door is a mere inconvenience to a player. Its only purpose is to keep you from seeing what's on the otherside, a.k.a, Verant's welfare version of a surprise.<br>
