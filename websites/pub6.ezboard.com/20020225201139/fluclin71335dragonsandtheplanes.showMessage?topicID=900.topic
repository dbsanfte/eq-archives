<br>
After spending my daily peruse of the message boards today, I noticed a couple references regarding taking a small raiding party (3 groups of upper 40s, lower 50s) to PoG.  Does anyone have a link to some info regarding raiding here?  Quite honestly after reading the little bit that I have on it, the place scares the kilt off me.  It would be nice if it's an option for my guild......so, if anyone has any words of advice or thx info~ , lemme know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Wish I new the guild this came from but sorry. There are other guides out there though. Read whatever you can find and expect bad things when you go. Just to be safe.<br>
==============================================<br>
OK, so you want to pull PoG? MUAHAHA! GL, you're heaping on yourself work and pain. <br>
<br>
Ok, where to start...hmm, the beginning. PoG is pulled in sections. Before you read this...go to EQ maps and everlore and check out the maps of PoG so you know what I'm talking about. <br>
<br>
PoG is a rectangle. The stream flows North to South the long way. One end is the waterfall, the other is the lake. The entrance is in the SouthWest corner...not too far from the lake. Tunare's tree is on the east side of the river, about midway between the east side of the zone (other side of teh river). <br>
<br>
Ok, how to pull. First thing is, you have to clear mobs by species or they end up getting in the way down the line (had to clear all the wolves/horses you missed last night before we could pull the named tree). <br>
<br>
1. RELY ON TRACK: Hit track before you start out...pull these mobs first. As you clear stuff out, run out just a few seconds and you can track all teh way to the river. As soon as you get a mob, use track to get back too by tracking group members. <br>
<br>
2. PULL ALL MOBS ON WEST SIDE FIRST. The river is kinda a boundry. It separates the easy mobs (west flat side) from the harder mobs (east side...mountainy). The west side mobs drop the little armor (hands, bracer, boots, helms). The east side dorps the BP's and legs...both sides drop arms. While pulling the first side, you should pull as soon as you drop off mobs...they just get killed really fast and its more time efficient. <br>
<br>
Ok, now how to do it. The first pull location is on the wall behind the port entry. (POGS INC EVERY 27 MINUTES FROM HERE).If you are on the west wall there (looking east) Hang a right first. Pull in the same direction so you clear the mobs out of a particular area. First go right, then go straight, then diagonal left, then straight left along the wall to clear a path to where you're gonna pull next. The first thing you do is pull all the horses and gale wolves. As you go diagonal, start getting some Spirit flux wolves (cannot be mezed). <br>
<br>
<br>
DONT PASS RIVER. Its too long of a pull and there's better places to pull from. When all the gale wolves and horses are dead, you can start pulling North so the group can move towards the watefall. You'll start pulling the glade staukers and Sanguine Kodiaks. Pull it first so you dont get adds. NEVER MOVE THE GROUP UNTILL RIGHT AFTER POGS. This is uber important. We've had alot of CR's cause we moved, had adds, then had pogs come. <br>
<br>
When you moved, you moved to the right place, you just hadnt cleared everything out. From the next spot (midway between the portal and the waterfall) you'll finish pulling the Spirit Flux wolves, Sanguine Kodiaks, and Glade staukers (POGS EVERY 28 MINUTES FROM HERE). Note: Again, looking east, pull diagonal right, straight, digonal left, then left all the way to the water fall. You can then move to the watefall (POGS EVERY 26 MINUTES FROM THE WATERFALL). <br>
<br>
Thats the west side. Its actually really easy. The hard part is the East side which entails pulling the entollings, Feral Amalgyms, Phase Pumas, Sylvan Proctectors, and Thiftlings. Of these mobs, only the Feral Amalgyms can be mezed but only by a lvl 55 plus enchanter. <br>
<br>
Pulling the phase pumas: If you want to pull the Keeper of the Glades, you have to get all the Phase Pumas. Theres usually 15 of them, but sometimes more or less. Everything on the east side has a HUGE wandering range unlike the mobs on the west side. This makes it really tough to pull them as you have to run a trillion miles to get them all. <br>
<br>
When pulling the phase pumas, stay off the wall. The entollings mostly wander closest to the wall and you'll aggro like 5 of them if you get too close to it. The first thing you do when you pull the phase pumas is clear the close 10 to 15 mobs so you dont aggro them on the way back. EVERYTHING ON TRACK THAT YOU CAN PICK UP AT THE WATERFALL MUST DIE or you'll train. After you kill the close stuff, theres a nice channel to pull all the phase pumas thats nice and flat. It goes right past Tunare's tree. At the waterfall faceing South by Southwest, you'll run over a couple hills and find this channel. I'll try to show it to you next time we're up...running the same route back and forth is UBER important cause you'll just pick up lots of @#%^. You cant pull phase pumas without CoH btw. Eventually, you'll aggro a ton of @#%^ and need it. <br>
<br>
How to CoH pull the pumas. Get one on track and comit to pulling it. As you run, keep hitting track so you grab the closest one. I often stop to let the track button repop so i dont run too far. OK, youve pulled a puma and you now got 2 pumas, 3 entollings, and a Feral amalgym on you on your way back. Track your group, follow the channel back. The channel ends when the grass turns from light brown to light green, then you have to run over a couple small hills. CALL FOR COH RIGHT AS YOU HIT THE CHANGE IN TEH GRASS. With your group on track, you'll want to have the message saying &quot;ahead and to the right.&quot; Dont run right at em or you'll run into them. Object is to get summoned with the mobs straight out in front of the group so you can go pull them. AFTER YOU CALL FOR COH, SWITCH TRACK FROM GROUP MEMBER TO A PHASE PUMA. This way, as soon as you get summoned, you can head right for it. <br>
<br>
As you start to run out of phase pumas, you'll have to run really really far. The end range of the Puma's is right where the Serene Forest Spirits Start. These are yellow and green lvl 60 mobs that look like giant will o wisps (yellow ones drop bards legs/bp, green ones drop shammy legs/bp. IF you wanna pull these, you gotta pull them from the lake and you have to clear the Sylvan Protectors first). Before you pull the Keeper, you have to run all teh way into them, hit track, and check for more pumas. If you dont get them all and you pull the Keeper, its a CR. NEVER PULL A NAMED MOB UNTILL AFTER THE POGS. This is another thing i've learned by trial and error. When pulling the phase pumas, dont pull any with less then 5 minutes left before PoGS. <br>
<br>
THIFTLINGS: Dont pull the thiftlings till i've shown you exactly where to set up, where to run, where to aggro, where to CoH, then how to pick them up. This took me a million tried to figure out and i found a good way of doing it, but i'll have to show you, I cant write it down. The thiflings are in 2 camps Each camp has around 10 thiftlings and a Protector which is a lvl 61 bear (pretty easy on his own). One camp also has Ordo and his assistant. Ordo's assistant drops the cleric/sk bp. He's around lvl 56. When pulling thiftlings, always have an FR buff cause they'll nuke the @#%^ out of you. <br>
<br>
Feral amalgyms and syvan protectors: You have to kill all teh Sylvans to pull Treah Greenroot. These 2 mobs have the largest range of any mob in PoG. They range the entire west side of the zone from North to South. Try and pull as many Feral Amalgyms as possible since theydrop the warrior BP and legs (which is really the most important gear up there as far as getting to ToV is concerned). Its a good idea to move the group along the river to P1200 P700 to pull all the Sylvans if you want to get Treah. THis is where clearing the west side is essential: If you dont clear the west side, the mobs will wander on to you at the river. The pathing for west side mobs goes east to west between teh west wall and the river. <br>
<br>
SIDE NOTES: <br>
<br>
1. Never pull the east side without a Coher. <br>
2. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have MR or GMR buff on since you will have 478394738 root and snare attempts. If you get rooted or snared...you're dust. <br>
3. HAVE DEFTDANCE HOTKEYED AND DONT BE AFRAID TO USE IT OFTEN. <br>
4. Keep a FR buff up when pulling the West side. <br>
5. Get yourself a countdown timer for pogs. YOu cant pull pog without a timer. You cant count on someone else to time the PoGs for you. <br>
6. Wear resist jewelry. Keep FR and CR above 100 or youll get nailed with ICE which is a comon spell for them to cast. Its 640 dmg DD and its all or nothing. You want it to be nothing...if your CR is below 100, itll hit you alot. Over and you'll resist it 99 percent of the time. <br>
7. Keep 2 illusions (iksar/de and werewolf) on top. You'll get dispelled ALOT (especially on the west side) and you dont wanna lose your MR or HP buff. <br>
8. Direct traffic: Tell people what to hit and mez on multi pulls or they'll stand around like idiots or they'll attack a random mob and break mez. Dont be afraid to call targets. Make sure if you pull 2 spirit flux wolves(cant be mezed), for instance, that you /shout to split them or all the idiots will get on one or sit there waiting for something to happen. <br>
9. ALWAYS ALWAYS have DMF when pulling the east side, especially for phase pumas. <br>
10. WHen pulling the entrance mobs, make sure you vear around the entrance so you dont aggro the invisible Whorl of Natural energy. If you do, its like a 3 minute spawn so it'll be right back up. If you aggro it, make sure to hit escape, let it hit you, then /shout for everyone to assist you and kill the whorl or it'll kill everyone. <br>
11. When pulling the west side, try to pull 2 at a time when you're pulling close to the river. This cuts down time down alot. <br>
12. When you first enter the zone, the PoGs inc inc 4 to 5 minutes. <br>
