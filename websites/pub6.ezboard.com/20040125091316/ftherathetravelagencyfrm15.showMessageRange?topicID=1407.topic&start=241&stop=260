If I recall Sev spawns about 5-7 days. That means that each of those guilds have the possibility to kill Sev possibly 2 times a year, providing server patches, crashes, resets and emergency patches don’t happen. Sev doesn’t always drop the scale. Unfortunately its not our fault SoE decided to make such a obstacle for the Warrior Epic. But its there and we are at least trying to be civil by sharing it instead of having 2 members from BoTs (just using their name, not saying they would) camping the mob 24/7 because well they would want some money. They could easily do that but they don’t resort to that, instead that was obviously done by another group of individuals who think they can’t be held accountable for their actions because they don’t have a guild tag. <br>
<br>
Epics are 3 expansions out of date, yes there are better items out there than the epics. Well then what’s the point of anything, I mean obviously there is better items out there for everyone so lets just have everyone skip point A and go directly to Plane of Time. The warrior epics aren’t the best weapons but they are actually decent weapons, add the fact they can now be augmented and now they are much better.<br>
<br>
I’m so happy that C4 has taken the time to go to the 20 guilds website, look over their players and made sure that none of them really need warrior epics. I mean after all if your in a guild and on a rotation they must be uber, never mind the fact that ¾ of those guilds average levels range 50-60. Its obvious that everyone must go from levels 1-20 and then they automatically go to 65 and better gear and weapons.<br>
<br>
As much as I sometimes hate the RTA and don’t always agree with them, I respect them. There is a difference between having a different point of view and just being a jerk and doing what you want because obviously your right and better. The difference is what it means to be an adult versus someone who is a child. <br>
<br>
For those people that are complaining that the members of C4 who weren’t present are being held accountable because they are associated with them, sorry but I have to agree with RTA. You say your not a guild, you’re a group of friends with common goals. Hate to break this to you but that’s a guild, gang, association. No matter how you break it down it’s the same thing, the only difference is that you don’t have a tag. If people from another country come here, they can’t just kill someone and claim well we’re not part of your country so we’re immune, there are repercussions.<br>
<br>
I have a group of friends just like C4 we call them Heartclan, it’s a channel of friends with members from guilds as NB, VoLS, CX and FS and that doesn’t mean we go around disrespecting everyone. We don’t always agree with RTA, sure we’d love to join together on some raids however we do follow what has been set in place. Why? Its simple because I’ve played on other servers and what you pulled happens everyday, except there isn’t anything I can do about it. I just have to deal with it. As your finding out RTA doesn’t just deal with it, they can do something and are. Yes you can all forever group in LdoN by yourselves, eventually some might give you a chance but you’ve just isolated yourselves. You say you weren’t involved in the guild so you shouldn’t be punished but you were, you’ve admitted to being part of an organization that sponsors admits it and says will do it again because they can.<br>
<br>
Congratulations on your Sev kill. Congrats to the warrior you help complete their epic. Congrats to the fact that you made 20 other guilds delay their own warriors work, devalued their time and effort since apparently they are guilded and part of community so you think they are just Uber Cockblockers. <br>

<br>
cool, then by that logic i'll just go grab my buddy with the shaman/sk 2-box and we'll duo (or trio) Sev every time he pops for the $bling bling$, God knows it's easy enough.  Hell, he's only a 32k mob, given enough resists I could probablly solo his ass.  <br>
<br>
And if not me, there's enough people/boxers/small groups in the top 10 guilds who can drop sev easier and faster then a fucking PoV trashmob. <br>
<br>
<br>
The rotations exist to PROTECT everyone's right to a fair chance at somthing. There's lots of FFA servers to choose from if you want that 'competition'.<br>
<br>
 I spent lots of time on the ultimate FFA sever where people don't race your raid, they PK and train it first and then go gank your mob.  If that was fun for more then a little while, i'd still be there.<br>
<br>
You disrespect the Rathe's sharing agreement at your peril, and you had best be prepared to pay the piper. <br>
<br>
 It won't be the ubers well past Sev who will be exacting the price either, it will be your peers who you fucked over who will have the knives out.<br>

Well, the bad news is that you a wrong.  This is not how the planes work at all.  How is it that your friends have going to the plane of hate and fear?  Hmmm, there must be some sort of an opportunity to go to these places without being in an actual guild!  Amazing, huh?  <br>
<br>
Just so all is clear here:<br>
If there is no reservation for a plane slated (and Sky is one of the most empty zones on both the calendar and in game), the plane is handled on a FCFS basis.  Furthermore, if you are in the plane through this FCFS rule, you have &quot;control&quot; of that plane.  The server conventions (if you were to chose to follow such a thing) state that no guild can enter the zone in force without your express permission.<br>
<br>
It sounds to me like what you need to do is to remove your thumb from your ass and head up to sky toget your mages their pieces.  <br>

Simple, your not a rotation guild nor are you a non-rotation guild. You claim that your all unguilded and therefore aren't breaking any rules, however your are a Guild/Organization no matter how you break it down... your claim your C4. Just because you haven't officially organized as one in game and carry a tag, you still advertise you are. Except you don't care about other Warrior's Epics, you don't care about other guilds, you don't even care about Sev... you just wanted to prove a point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gatorivonhinx>Gatori Vonhinx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/10/03 1:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: &gt;_&lt;</span><hr size=1> No one ever asked you if you wanted to be on the rot?

The biggest problem you will encounter with becoming a guild is the fact that you can't double-dip.  That is, you cannot have members that are in guilds that are on the same rotation that the alliance joins. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crystessiavallaen>Crystessia Vallaen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.protoculturex.com/pictures/wolfjumpsheep.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/10/03 1:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: &gt;_&lt;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm pretty sure Karasu wouldnt have a problem with being put on the rot now if this is how this is going to clear this all up<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Reward the Gankers by putting them on the rot? I had a feeling this was going to be mentioned somewhere along the line. I really hope this doesn't happen. Gankers broke the rules. Gankers are not a posting entity.
