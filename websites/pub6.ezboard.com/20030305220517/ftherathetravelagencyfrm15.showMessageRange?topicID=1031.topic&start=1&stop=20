Someone to look out for!</span><hr size=1> Okay, <br>
<br>
   We needed a meaty flame ladies and gentlemen, and I present you with this for your viewing pleasure.  The backstory begins like this.  Once upon a time a few of us Circles End'ers worked together, and played together and everything was happy.  My good friend Haldolmer has two accounts, one for Haldolmer, his cleric, and one for his Warrior Malkia.  On Malkia's account there resides a wonderful level one bazaar rat named Inkiesmithy, who was made to stay up in the bazaar and sell the warez of Maraa's (another guildie/friend) GM smith.  <br>
<br>
   Well, On the second of Feb, Inkiesmithy was logged in after going linkdead to find about 2300 plat missing, as well as 14 blue diamonds, that were to be used for some cultural smithing.  Mind you, this seemed a bit odd, but nonetheless worth investigating.  After several petitions over the course of a few days, we had found out only one thing.  Inkiesmithy was taken up to the Plane of Knowledge, dropped the 14 blue diamonds and a Stave of Shielding on the ground, and then went back to the Bazaar and camped.  <br>
<br>
   Well, since none of us have ever owned a Stave of Shielding, this seemed to be a bit off of the norm, and would seem to confirm that someone had accessed the account without Haldo's knowledge.  The only person that we know of who would have used a Stave of Shielding, would have been our now Ex-Coworker Stabbin's new monk, Morekik.  Now, it's hard to just assume that a friend and co-worker would get into your account and steal from you, but as the following conversation with a GM-Admin will show, there arn't many other conclusions one can draw.<br>
<br>
   It must have been Staabin, who from work, could have easily guessed what Haldo's password to his second account would have been.  Not to mention, that he knew the vendor was on that account, and not the cleric's.  He also has seen in person, Haldo log into both accounts, easily knowing the log in name for his secondary account.  That was when Haldo logged in to GIVE him an SMR to complete Staabin's Epic <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
   I conclude with the fact, that since he was a long time gamer, he knew that a trade would easily be tracked, and knew that he would proably get caught.  He logged in Inkiesmithy, purchased a Stave of Shielding, went to PoK in some secluded corner, and dropped it, along with the very light, very expensive stack of blue diamonds on the ground in a backpack, logged in either Staabin or Morekik to pick them up and went on his merry way, AFTER making sure to return the vendor to her normal position in the bazaar.  Below are the logs, and a screenshot of the conversation with the GM-Amdin....Enjoy!<br>
<br>
Also note, he plays toons named .... <br>
<br>
Staabin Deeply 55-56 Halfling Rogue, <br>
Sinissterr 25ish DEF Necro<br>
Which 20ish IKS Shammy<br>
Morekik 25ish IKS Monk<br>
Skaley Wagg IKS War<br>
Kinadas Holyknight 51-52 HEF Paladin<br>
<br>
Please, keep an eye out and steer clear of this thief...we were his friends, and coworkers, and we have even given him a place to stay on a few occasions while he got his life in order over the last 2 years...god only knows what he might take from you.<br>

[Tue Feb 04 18:14:16 2003] You told kazann, 'Hi, sorry to bother, I'm responding to an answer from a petition by zelorixa while I was at work today.  This toon  came up missing plat and 14 blue diamonds.  According to zelorixa we took the toon to PoK and the BD's along with a stave of sheilding were dropped on the ground.  This toon has never owned a stave of sheilding, has not been out of the bazaar/sh/nexus zones since I moved it here./  None of my toons have had a stave of sheilding, plus she did not address the lost plat =( '<br>

This toon has NEVER been to PoK, has never had a stave of sheilding, I started petitioning on the 2nd, adn if it did go to POk, this toons can move outside bazaar, too heavy. Whoever investigated has to have looked at the wrong logs.  I've worked so hard save the money and BD;s over so long, what your saying isn't possible, how can I accept that?  '<br>

[Tue Feb 04 18:19:23 2003] You told Kazann, 'kk, thanks'<br>
[Tue Feb 04 18:30:48 2003] You petition, 'Repetitioning for the 4th time.  Was told by Zelorxia our BD's and a stave of sheilding were dropped in PoK.  This toon has never left Bazaar/SH/Nexus zone since being put here.  We have never had a Stave of sheilding, please help by telling me where it came from if all this is true.  I've worked long and hard for the money and BD's, I can't accept what I believe to be impossible.  Also, I started petitioning on the 2nd when all of this supposedly happened.  Please help, its been days.  Thanks'<br>

[Tue Feb 04 18:49:43 2003] Kazann tells you, 'Does anyone else have your account information please, perhaps?'<br>
[Tue Feb 04 18:49:55 2003] You told Kazann, 'Can you tell me if the toon that picked it up was named Morekick or Stabbin?'<br>
[Tue Feb 04 18:50:34 2003] You told Kazann, 'There was a co-worker who did not have my password but may have guessed it. He was recently fired and I am thinking now that it may have been him?'<br>

Someone to look out for!</span><hr size=1> As Allaa said the toon was in the bazaar.  As you can see the start time on the log and when the gm said Hello, it was a long while.  I am on dialup, I am prone to LD.  The toon was setup before I went to work, the AFK set, the log turned on.  This was in case I went LD, then I could check the log for a response when I got home.  Its a HUGE log, it was editted becuase of all the says, ooc, spells and such.  See the linked screenshot, I have both.  Make your own decisions about the situation, but don't accuse me of a false log.  But since I'm sure someone will insist its false, you asked for it.  The log from start to the last tell the GM was sent.  <br>
