I dont know about other people's raids, but we don't tell our members that they are not welcome toa plane because we have too many already there and they are going to create lag, especially if we only get to go once a month. Our plane raids are consistently above 40 people. At one time when we were allied with MFH we had almost 70 people in Hate all at once at the SW corner - soon after we ended the alliance.<br>
<br>
I will not ask our members to go join some other guild either so that they can join a guild that has 39 members<br>
<br>
<br>
Fact is, a guild that has 80 planable members (or accounts) should have twice as many days as a guild that has 40 members.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubradanaybara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bradan aybara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Master</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/15/00 1:13:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Errr..</span><hr size=1> &quot;You realised that you weren't going to get anywhere near the number of chances you thought you'd get under the guise of 'helping clear the mobs others couldn't' and now you change the playing field again to suit yourselves.&quot;<br>
-- There's no way in hell you know if anyone realized anything that's not stated. Guise of helping another guild clear mobs they cant? um no, point is to get those epic mobs down the day they came up. taking those mobs down gives epic quest pieces for the time it takes, no other loot. otherwise these smaller guilds wouldnt have gotten anything, and those epic mobs might have been wasted. The proposal was stated to make sure everyone got their time in the planes, and those epic mobs went down. If those epic mobs werent up, then it really doesnt matter to these guilds if the plane is cleared, as long as those epic mobs arent going to waste for whatever reason. Those epic calendar guilds can complete these quests, therefor have offered a solution to keep those mobs going down when they come up and maximizing the amount of quest pieces on the server. It's not wrong or greedy to offer assistance in an organized manner to those that cannot take those mobs down. As well as those epic quest pieces on those days be given to a guild that can effectively complete the quest at that time.<br>
 Nope, personally i dont agree with more than 1 day in a plane at a time either, but that was requested as part of the compromise to be brought up.<br>
 Fact is noone's given these guilds anything, it's something these guilds have worked for and learned along the way. Taking a lot of time to do so.<br>
 In a FFA system, these guilds would have rotated amongst themselves and not cared who was in the plane. ( much like other servers do right now in a FFA system. ) who do you think gets stepped on there?<br>
 Calendar was created so the guilds at the time ( 3 - 4 ) wouldnt clash with what they were doing. They opened this calendar up to everyone, and in doing so lessened their own days in the planes. Now, with so many guilds that can do these planes, they're limited to 1 in a month - month 1/2. So realize the frustration level of guilds that have been there forever being told, no, the calendar you created to post intents between yourselves is now  limiting you to once in a blue moon chance at anything you want.<br>
 You think on a FFA server that the smaller guilds arent stepped over to get to these gods for their epic quests? go check out a ffa server and see.<br>
 Point of the matter is some are worried that those guilds that cannot take down X mob, wont call in a guild that's up on rotation to help out for it. Yeah, shooting down the proposal because of it is condeming it before it's in place, but with the abuse in the past on the calendar as it was, it's a viable concern. It should be stated that every posting entity agrees to call in the next guild up to help or lose their plane days, But again, that's infringing on peoples rights to do a plane. That is the problem, overcome that and come to an agreement on it from all sides, and there's gonna be a calendar in place. It's an honor system, and everyone has to respect it. This isnt a national govt, this isnt a job, this is a game, and in a game you have to respect your fellow players enough to follow the majority.<br>
 No sunwolf, i'm not attacking you. I had enough of that Arguement and one sided banter on my own msg board. Your post almost makes it look like you fully understand what the proposal was, if you'd stop making assumptions as to what other people are thinking and what they meant. If you dont know what people mean, just ask. It's not easy putting a clear meaning into words alone without being face to face to someone. <p><table width="50%" border="0">

<br>
You begged the question 'WHATS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE'. Fair enough. I will try to answer and Im welcome on anyones view/comments, good or bad.<br>
<br>
Uberguild is displayed with 80 members vs smaller guild with 40 people. I will assume you associate 80 people as Big Brother Guild and a 40 person guild as a lower guild for some odd reason. <br>
<br>
Items wrong with this picture. It has to be taken into account with Aegs quote....<br>
<br>
Quote: 'Calling a BB guild to clear a plane just makes sense'<br>
<br>
Well then based on your picture you are wrong.<br>
<br>
1) First off when did a guild with 40 planeable members ever need help clearing a plane by Big Brother? 40 people is enough people to kill Inny as people know. Our guild has clearing Hate and Fear with 3 groups. A few times we cleared Fear with only 2 groups. You might want to be more specific on the word 'clear'. Most times Gods are not up so calling BB is never needed.<br>
<br>
2) A guild with 40 planeable members could be classified as BB by others. EG: A 20 man guild needs help with Maestro or Inny. They don't need to call a &quot;BB&quot; guild just any guild with 10-20 more people. Again calling a BB makes little sense as its not a direct requirement, unless others cannot be found. Many guilds have alliances, they are our BB.<br>
<br>
3) This picture is not productive and I was honestly disturbed by it. It suggests that a 80 person guild is entitled 'special' privileges. Honestly if guilds took the picture seriously this would be chaotic. People would believe that the 'more' people you have in a guild or alliance the 'better' or more 'privileged' you are. That is not true. I strongly believe and will always believe that the true power of a guild for the planes/dungeons lies in its 'skills' rather then sheer manpower. Gods can be exceptions though as manpower is often required, but again you are talking 'clearance' of planes, when gods are often not up.<br>
<br>
I have a Question for the BB guilds. <br>
<br>
- I have seen references that you are not focusing on greed in these posts. But you do NEED something or people in BB would not be posting. What is it that BB guilds NEED so much and maybe the Rathe and other guilds will understand.<br>
<br>
The End<br>

-- one guild comes to mind, others are about. How many people does Soul slayers have that are planeable.<br>
-- the epic rotation is for those that cannot ( like soul slayers ). opening up more days on the calendar is the 40 member in a guild/alliance to &quot; be able to post reserveration &quot;, and not necessarilly there on a raid.<br>

<br>
The BB guilds want more chances at the epic mobs others can't handle.<br>
<br>
But unfortunately it hasn't stayed that way - if it had we'd have a system agreed and in place by now. What Aegirson has posted in another thread and enhanced upon here, are his feelings that a guild with 80+ member's should be allowed 2 days in the planes because of their size. [correct me if I'm assuming wrong here]<br>
<br>
I don't agree with that view. Perhaps the problem lies not in the system but in the size of the guilds?  <p><img src="http://www.oelph.com/skoppel.jpg" align="right">

Who gets extra days?  All the BB guilds?  Guilds with X number of planesable toons?<br>
<br>
If its all BB guilds, then too many guilds/alliances will be getting extra days.  We currently have 5 BB, by the end of the month there will be 1-2 more, by the end of the year 8-10 BB?  Do all 10 of them get extra days?  So 10 out of the 15 (from Rewena's listing) posting entities would get an extra day by the end of the year?  <br>
<br>
Or base it on X number of planesable toons?  100 toons?  75?<br>
<br>
Or make is easy the X number of lagest guilds/alliances on the server get extra days?  So the 3 largest guilds (FoR, Bots, and ?) would get an extra day?  The 5 largest?<br>
<br>
I personally don't have any problems with larger guilds getting more days.  More people = more days, I can understand that.  But give me some specifics please.  <p>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

Originally the larger, older guilds (I hate the term uber...only applies to BotS anyways) wanted more chances at epic loot to complete their quests faster. Then it turned into &quot;we have too many posting entities&quot;, I can agree with that. Now it's &quot;BB guilds need more days&quot;, I won't agree with that. If you wanna base it on numbers then do so and give ANY entity with 75 or more planeable toons an extra day.<br>
<br>
The percieved problem keeps being redifined here and thats not going to get us anywhere. I think I can speak for most of the smaller guilds when I say we're pretty content with the days we have now and just want to have our fun in the planes and with any luck start completing our sets of armor, we aren't hellbent on more days and we don't have many qualms about calling in a BB to take a god down. We aren't going to hand over half of our days and our dignity, running away with our tails between our legs.<br>
<br>
As I said, if you want  more days base it on numbers, if you want more epic loot then quit adding new stipulations so we can get something put in effect.<br>

You are not aiming for a system based on numbers - you are basing it on some elistist notion that there are First Class and Second Class entities.  Simply stating something as a fact, does not make it so.<br>
<br>
You are not saying that any guild with 80 people should have twice as much time as a guild with 40 members.  You are saying Five guilds are seen by you as equals and are somehow superior to other guilds.   KEG/BOTS/CIW/MFH/FOR are the guilds you find &quot;worthy&quot; of getting extra days.  It's not up to you or those five guilds to decide what scraps the rest of us get.<br>
<br>
For one thing, your guild as posted on Rewena's list has 75 people - my alliance has 69.  RoS has 75, SoT is close at 63.  Certainly more than 40.  Yet the proposal only says these Five &quot;Class A&quot; entities get extra days.  Sorry, the elitism won't fly.  You are our equal, not our superior.  You choose to have a guild that has 75 members, I choose to be in an Alliance of 69, even though NH has 40 of its own members.  We live with those decisions - you want a guild of 90 so be it, you want a guild of 30, then deal with that decision.  Neither of us is &quot;entitled&quot; to more days than the other, neither based on accomplishments nor on numbers.  As you and Sukar like to say - don't make this communism.  It's not per person plane time, it's per guild - always has been.<br>
<br>
Under the current proposal that the vast majority support (i.e. one day raids in Fear/Hate for EVERYONE), we ALL get to go to the planes more often than once a month.  At 40 members per entity, we have 16 valid posting entities.  That is enough that almost EVERY entity gets two, ONE day raids per month per plane.  And no one has to be an elitist about it.<br>

Unless or until there is a system in place by which these discussions can offer up any kind of useful changes to a calendar system, all we are doing is yelling at each other and increasing our aggro radius.<br>
<br>
The best thing that could happen right now is for the calendar system, in ANY form, to get put in place by someone who is going to administer it.<br>
<br>
And then put up a board, or a poll, or some system by which people can submit Change Requests to the calendar, write a little explanatory paragraph about why, and let people vote on it.<br>
<br>
I've posted all the details for how this would work in another message, so I won't get into it again.<br>
<br>
But some sample amendments/proposals taht could be floated with a system like this in place:<br>
<br>
* Proposed that all guilds who can clear to isle 5 of Sky be permitted 2 concurrent posting dates in the calendar per month. (THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE, RELAX)<br>
<br>
* Proposed that the calendar be abolished and nothing replaces it. (so hey! we theoretically could all vote for FFA)<br>
<br>
* Proposed that all epic quest mobs are put on a 100% separate rotation/calendar, so even if your guild CAN kill innorruuk/Maestro, you don't kill them if they are up unless you are ALSO on the epic rotation.<br>
<br>
etc, etc. <br>
<br>
So we could have a working, living document that wouldn't have to be thrown out every 6 months when someone gets pissed.<br>
<br>
The calendar system is flawed, but the biggest flaw is that it is a rigid set of rules, with no structure for discussing/implementing changes.<br>
<br>
I say implement any calendar rules right now.  If we can come up with something like a parliment/voting system for changes that is at least moderately agreeable, we can easily move forward.<br>
<br>
But most likely, we'll just all get into it again and rehash the same crap because nobody is listening to anyone but themselves.<br>

<br>
Why? Well you say guild A has 80 planeable toons. And in past posts it has been said that some of those members have all but exhausted regular plane loot. So lets split it down the middle - you now have 40 members who would like standard plane loot and 40 who want epic loot.<br>
<br>
The 40 who want epic loot work the epic calendar. The 40 who want standard loot work the normal calendar. No extra days are needed because, by your own statement (although it probably got deleted when you wiped the boards) x number of members have exhausted the planes.<br>
<br>
<br>
And on another note I don't even recall the first proposal being shot down AFTER we'd gotten all the problems regarding miscommunication out of the way. I think people were more than willing to go along with the epic calendar and calling in BB for epic mobs if needed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Additionally on the topic of secondary characters - each 'character' doesn't deserve equal chances at plane loot. Each 'player' deserves equal time. You have that choice of using the time to devote to one character or the other. Otherwise the whole arguement shifts again and a person with 8 planeable toons deserves 8 days of a month in the planes - extreme example yes but it highlights the point.<br>

   You are quite correct no one shot down thefirst proposal - unless you call Aegirson's 'Declaration' a 'proposal'.  If you speak of Jerrica's 'rewording' and subsequentproposal involving BB guilds - then no, that hasn't been shotdown.  That is the one everyone is hammering through and tryingto get in place.  I can only guess why some small factions areinsisting it was shot down. Quibbling, yes - shot down, no.<br>

Itwouldn't mean that Guild X has a guaranteed to raids to the sameplane in a month, since it would be rotated more or less, ifyou posted early for a plane raid, chances are you'd be ableto get another one right away again.<br>
<br>
What you proposedwas a guaranteed 2 extra days in a plane for N number of guilds.Although I can see your reasoning for it, and I believe someoneelse countered this earlier (Rewena?) by saying if most of yourmembers already have armor from the planes and you really onlyneed the epic loot drops, then take the non-fully armored guildmembers to the plane, have the BB guilds called in for epic dropsfor those who can't or aren't able to kill the 'boss' mobs duringtheir raids (it would have to be during the raid, and not followedup the next day or whatever even if the next days guild couldeasily kill a god; or some other proposal). Now that's a run-on sentence.<br>
<br>
As for having 40-50+ in a plane, I knowexactly how it is. I've been there already.<br>

<br>
&quot;Pretty simple - yes the end goal here isto have more shots at epic mobs. Why KEG, BOTS, CIW, FOR arepushing for class &quot;a&quot; entities to have more days, isthat so statistically we are going to have more chances at epicmobs. A beneficial effect is that it also promotes more fairnessin the sence of plaver vs plane time.<br>
<br>
Our first proposal- which did not ask for more dates - was shot down so we trieda new approach.&quot;<br>
<br>
End<br>
<br>
Couple questions.<br>
<br>
Shot down by whom? <br>
The only guilds I saw shootingit down were CIW, and BOTS. Oh and that freak Xenth.<br>
<br>
Who or what feat determines a guilds class &quot;a&quot; status?<br>
It had better be damn impressive, like killing Trakanonwithout invites. Do that and I wouldnt mind giving you an extraday in the planes.<br>

So far BoTS and KEG have done it. I don't know with orwithout invites, even without invites both guilds could do itthough.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't see a problem with those guildsgetting two days. I'd hope that they would be allowed to bringin as many invites as they wanted so gear didn't rot though.<br>

Look at it, folks .. even with some guilds getting 2days .. it still brings the wait time down considerably.<br>

Iwould ask that you stop trying to fuel the flames of discontent.Over time most have agreed to the principle that the biggestgulids get more dates - but HOW is still under discussion.  <br>
The &quot;Final proposal&quot; actually DOES have &quot;A&quot; class guilds with 2 dates... If Trankon or the X islandof sky is the determining factor is the question really.<br>
<br>
One other thought - just basing it on populatoin is nota good approach.  Back in July my old guild (Far Runners) hadover 50 planes ready members and almost 200 players - shouldwe have gotten 2 days in fear or hate - hell no, we could barely(at the time) kill cazic (record was 1-0 on him), inny was (1-0), vox was (0-2) and naggy (1-1).  By no means were we an &quot;A&quot; class guild in terms of ability; but we were one of thebiggest guilds at the time.<br>
<br>
If BOTS/KEG/MFH/CIW entirearguement is the picture you showed, then I believe RoS outnumbersyou by almost 2 to 1 - should they get 4 dates? (Correct me ifI am wrong, but RoS had been close to 170 members).<br>
<br>
There MUST be a litmus test for &quot;A&quot; class guilds...one SO hard that at MOST only 3-4 guilds will EVER meet it. Otherwise the calendar would be booked for the next 3 monthsall the time. <p>Elaundar Nobillium

One thing that i've thought about today is an argument againstgoing FFA strictly from an annoyance factor.<br>
<br>
I surehope BOTS, CIW &amp; KEG are all ready to start getting hundredsmore tells.  I know you all take people up with you on your raidsnow.<br>
<br>
Right now, I don't bother begging in /tells forinvites to planes, but if/when the planes go FFA, I won't havemuch choice except to start giving random tells to the largeguilds.<br>
<br>
The calendar is a useful resource for scheduling,but it's even more valuable as a resource for players like mewho aren't in on every raid planning, and need to know who isdoing what, and when.<br>
<br>
Now multiply that by, oh ... therest of the server population that's not in a guild or alliancethat is independently planable.<br>
<br>
I think that's a worsenightmare than any calendaring proposal, but maybe that's justme.<br>
