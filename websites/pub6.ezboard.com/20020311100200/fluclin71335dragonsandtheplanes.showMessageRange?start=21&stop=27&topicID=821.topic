If  I was in Raventod's situation I would be royaly pissed. If I was the 42 bard would I have passed on scale, well maybe. If I knew the person and they only needed that scale and the one off naggy i would give it to them in a second. If I didnt know them at all (ie even by reputation) I might not. After all the scales are probably as rare as the books and said 42 Bard could go on every Naggy raid for the next 9 months and never get the other scale. The fact is that if they were invited and told they could roll on scale and won. Perhaps the best thing to do would be for raid leaders to state if scale dropped or book dropped they are always reserved for certain ppl. Before anybody flames me for this idea this would mean I would practiacly be assured of never getting the books, since my guild will never be taking down Naggy or Vox, most ppl just sail on past 53 so even if I wanted to organize a raid most of the ppl in my guild would be to high or low. Just an idea anyway.<br>

<br>
I have seem my friends play EQ since it's inseption, playing vicariously thru them and by listening them talk about it. Reading nad hearing about a game is far different than actaully palying it... for years. That basically makes a well-versed noob.<br>
<br>
You say that I am greedy. If keeping a scale I won and wont give it up is greed, then I must be. IF taking steps to ensure you own sucess is greed, then I must be. But realize that you do not know me well enough to make _any sort of generalizations about my character or honor.<br>
<br>
When I first won the scale, I got TONS of msg'ing asking me if I would sell it or give them/someone else, and yes Forsakenn was one of them. What I said then still holds true:<br>
I was very lucky to have won the scale at all, and I do not wish to test fate again. This is why<br>
<br>
TO some extent, you are right Pylfer, I am going as fast as I can. I started to collect gems for the velious armor in my 30's, for one. But is that really all that strange? Who wants to purposely stall there level to finish a quest? Apparently doing so is a major stress factor that noone likes doing. I have relieved myself, somewhat, of one of those stresses. Now, I ask all of you, who woudl want to add more stress upon themselves?<br>
<br>
Not yielding the scale does not make me greedy; if anything it makes me selfish; thinknig of myself over others. Then again, I am not Luclins licsenced Martyr.<br>

I think starting early is a sign of good planning, not greed.  Maybe by the time you're 52, you'll be able to continue on to 53 without any thought of stalling your leveling.  ppl are jealous that you won and are calling you greedy and selfish because of that jealousy.  <br>
<br>
I'm glad u didnt give up the scale.  ppl telling you, &quot;oh im so happy for you Irulani, congrats .... now gimme the scale because my luck is terrible and im higher lvl than u, its what i would do&quot;.... bah.  You were there, and you played your mana song and your elemental rhythms and your haste and whatever the hell else bards play hehe, all through the giants and on into the fight against vox.  You stayed the entire time and did your best.  Its not as if u were standing in a corner anonymous.  If ppl didn't like you being 42 or how the loot was being done, they should've turned their ass around and walked out of perma.<br>
<br>
Not only were you in the right place at the right time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    You tossed the dice and won.

I KNOW you aren't talking about me. I was the first to congratulate Irulani when she won the scale. I did ask her if she would sell or trade it to me and when she refused, I dropped it.<br>
<br>
Go back and Re-read my posts before you come here and call me a &quot;bitter and jaded, lvl 52-and-holding bard.&quot;<br>
<br>
If I have any reason to be bitter it's having to read posts like this and boggle at the inanity of it all.<br>

I lost the roll. I accepted it. I didn't like it, but I am going to keep trying.  <p><p align="center">

I wonder if maybe when I organized the raid against venril sathirs remains someone higher level than me and everyone else might have told me I did not deserve to loot because I was not the right level if I would have even continued to play the game at all...<br>
<br>
But I think thatwas my turning point in the game, I went from pissing people off and being a solo as much as I can player, to a team player that as often as I can I help others get group built to take on their epic mobs...<br>
<br>
I just now finally made level 53 after I completed my epic, with huge amounts of help from many people, I have a journal stock full of many names I won't remember unless I look through it, and I look through it pretty much every week, and I add to it every day....<br>
<br>
Now your right at level 42 his contribution had to be minor when you got to naggy, but against the rest of the foes that took 90% of the raids time, he was a very effective force I am certain. I wonder if he brought any friends with him to that raid, and I am certain he would be a friend to everyone at that raid if they ever gave him a shot. A year from now you will ALL be in the same place anyways.. level 60 wondering what to do with your time...<br>
<br>
thats just my feelings... I think epics are what turn solo players into leaders of many. I still have alot of work to be a great leader, but I try hard, and do my best to keep everyone happy and on track. <p>Sivana

Heh well Gratz on the scale.... rules were set and ya won.. now i admit... gotta suck for the other bards... but hey... it happens... i was pissed when i lost 2 dragon scales the other day to lower folks.... but then i thought back and remembered hey.... when i went planar at 46 i had almost everything done in my epic except the uber mobs and plane mobs... did all the grunt work.. did all the ... run this there.... buy this... combine this... camp that... so i know when my day came to go on the raids that i would be more than ready...<br>
<br>
You gotta start somewhere... <br>
<br>
However i do agree with the 50+ rule... but thats only cause im 50+ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  had you asked me when i was 46 and mostly done with the little stuff it might have been diffrent <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ... i know you cant do alot of the bigger stuff till 50+ but you gotta start somewhere.... if everyone was on a raid where someone needed last piece then no one would get anything done (which might i add i would personally pass on an item to those folks) <br>
<br>
When i got to raid... i go to raid... whether its Naggy/Vox<br>
or a plane... loot and epic items are always nice... but the more you get your hopes up ... the bigger the let down..so go to have fun peeps... <br>
<br>
Anyway... ya ya i know... just repeated others thoughts and added my own... but as a stuggeling epic pursurer i had to toss in my 2cp<br>

Personally, I think everyone should have a chance at an OPEN RAID.   If you need that specific person's help, they should get the same chance as one of your friends.   The answer is don't invite any other paladins or bards.  Heck just solo it, than you won't have to worry about anyone else getting your uber loot.  ;o) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=821.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showPrevMessage?topicID=821.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showNextMessage?topicID=821.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=821.topic&index=27><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/es/themes/default/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.emailToFriend?topicID=821.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.threadControl?topicID=821.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/es/themes/default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=821.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=821.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub6.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="luclin71335general">General<option value="luclin71335trading">Trading<option value="luclin71335frm7">Spell Trading<option value="luclin71335dragonsandtheplanes">Dragons and the Planes<option value="luclin71335frm23">GMT Gamers<option value="luclin71335frm8">Scars of Velious<option value="luclin71335frm26">Shadows of Luclin<option value="luclin71335roleplaying">Roleplaying<option value="luclin71335frm19">Fun Stuff: Arts, Jokes, Stories<option value="luclin71335grouping">Grouping<option value="luclin71335guilds">Guilds<option value="luclin71335frm17">Raves and Congrats<option value="luclin71335flamesandrants">Flames and Rants<option value="luclin71335frm9">Other games (super condensed)<option value="luclin71335frm14">Dark ages of Camelot<option value="luclin71335frm22">News and Upcoming Events<option value="luclin71335frm12">Luclin Forum Policies<option value="luclin71335frm18">Signature Testing<option value="luclin71335frm24">Past Favorites<option value="luclin71335frm13">Share your thoughts on the recent tragedies...</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bluclin71335>Luclin</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes>Dragons and the Planes</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
