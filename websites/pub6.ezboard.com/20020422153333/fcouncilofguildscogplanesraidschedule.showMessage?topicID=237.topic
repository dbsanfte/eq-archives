Nothing is worse than having bad lag, turning around and realizing that you have no clue where everyone went, and you have no clue where you are. If you have studied the map and maybe have a printable version, you can possibly help someone to find you. Find out the route the raid will be taking from the port-in room to the first camp so if you fall behind, lag, or otherwise get left behind, you know which way to go. <br><br>Study your enemy. There are a whole slew of websites out there that can tell you almost everything you need to know about the creatures you will be fighting. The more you know, the easier it will be to bring them down. <br><br>If the information is posted, set up your hotkeys for MA, SA, heals, and clarity set up in advance. I will go into more detail on this later. <br><br>Stock up on things you will need for the raid. Purchase spell components, food and water, etc. Also dont forget to have what you need handy in RL to be spending 6-12 hours at your computer. Food that can be grabbed from the kitchen on the go, a 24 pack of pop or a container to hold other beverages and keep them hot or cold, and cigarettes if you smoke. It is also handy to have paper/pen handy by your computer. <br><br>Log at the meeting spot the night before so you dont have to worry about getting a port at the last minute. If you are a tank, get bound at the closest city, if you are a caster, at the meeting spot its self unless you are a porting class and can port to the meeting spot when needed. This will facilitate communications in the case of a wipe-out (and there will be at least one) especially if there are non-guild members at the raid. It also helps to have an alt guilded so that if you have to camp or /q you can keep in contact. <br><br>The day of the raid: Before the raid <br>Log on at least 15 minutes before the scheduled start time for the raid. An hour is preferable. <br><br>Contact the raid leader and let them know that you are there. <br><br>If you were unable to get to the meeting location the night before, do so now. <br><br>If you dont know already, find out who the MA and SA are. Make a hotkey with 2 lines on it. The first being /target &lt;main assist&gt; the next being /assist. Do the same with the other hotkey, substituting &lt;secondary assist&gt; for &lt;main assist&gt; <br>If you dont know already, find out who you will be asking for buffs such as clarity, symbol, speed, etc. Make a hotkey asking this person in /tell for the buff you need so that all the people on the raid dont have any more chat to have to scroll through than necessary. <br><br>If you dont know already, find out who you will be asking for things such as cure poison, and make a hotkey informing them that you are poisoned and need a cure ASAP <br><br>Make a hotkey to tell your group and the MA that you are being attacked if you are not a melee <br><br>Find out which chat channels will be used for which purpose. Most guilds will have raid leaders, group leaders, pullers, and MA/SA use one channel, looters another, and have another channel designated for frivolous chat, /auction is good to use for this, as it can be turned off at will, and more than likely will not be being used by anyone else. If you dont want to listen, and want to concentrate on the raid, turn this channel off now. <br><br>Find out which group you will be in. Find or make a designated spot for your group to sit. This will assist in finding each other and facilitate quicker buffing. <br>Find out who the designated looter for your group will be if it is decided by raid leader, if not, decide that amongst the group now. <br><br>If you are a buffing or porting class, get your spell reagents from the raid leader now. <br><br>If you are a mage, start passing out mod rods. Make sure everyone has one. These are for the clerics. This will allow you to get to FM before the port-up, and also if there is a wipeout on the break-in it will ensure there is mana immediately available for the clerics. <br><br>If you are a buffing class, find out from the leader which buffs you will be placing on people. Once the call to buff is placed, move from group to group, buffing in an orderly fashion. Once all buffs on groups are done, then the buffers can buff them selves and all the other buffers. <br><br>Once all buffs have been placed on you, log to the chat server. This will ensure that all the buffs are still there and will not wear off during the break-in. <br><br>Once everyone is buffed and logged out to the chat server, the call will be given to log back in. Do so immediately. Do not decide that you have a minute or two, so now is the time to do last minute preparations. These need to have been done before you ever logged on. <br><br>Once logged in, immediately get in your groups. Stay in your group areas. Once the call has been given for the port up, you dont want the porter to have to ask if you are ready. Be ready. <br><br>If you are one of the porters, get to whichever group the leader tells you to port up first. Group with them, wait for the call to port, then port up. If you will be expected to port multiple groups, Disband and immediately gate back down. <br><br>Once you are in the portal room, stand in the center. Do not go near the walls, do not sit down. The room is small, more so when there are multiple groups in there. Be patient, put up with the sweat and the stench, it is better than being dead. <br><br>Once all groups are up, then it is time to do the most difficult part, the break-in. <br><br>The day of the raid: The break-in <br><br>If you are lucky, nothing aggroed upon port-in. If not, you got in a fight immediately. If this is the case, do not panic. Use your MA hotkey, and fight that mob. Trust your enchanters to mez the rest. I will detail more on fighting later. <br>If it looks hopeless, and you think you will not make it, keep fighting. Watch your raid channels. If the order is given for the clerics to camp out, protect those clerics at all costs. Once the clerics have safely made it out, then you can /q to get yourself out. If you are a Monk, SK, or Necro, feign death if you can. This will allow you to let others know when it is safe to come back. Once you have told the raid leader it is safe, you must /q out to clear agro. Unfortunately, sometimes agro stays after you have gotten out. Stay out for 3 minutes to ensure agro is gone. <br><br>Once everyone is ported in and any immediately aggroed baddies are dead, the puller will proceed to pull mobs from the route to the first camp. Do not sit down unless you have to, you might accidentally aggro the mobs from the surrounding buildings. <br><br>Once the route to the first camp is clear, the order will be given to move out. The raid leader or the puller will be the one to lead the raid to the first camp. The route is along the walls. Walk half way up the wall, no more no less. Any more, you might agro stuff from the second floor, any less, you might agro stuff from the buildings you pass. <br><br>If anything attacks you, stand there and die. Do not bring it to the camp with you. Better to have only one person dead than the entire raid. Get a /loc before you die, so that you can tell the corpse dragger where your body is. It will be brought to the camp and rezzed there. <br><br>If Innoruuk shouts your name, immediately /q out. That means that you have somehow managed to agro him, and he will either death touch you, or come down from the second floor, bringing the entire zone with him. Wait for 3 minutes, log back in, and then proceed carefully to the camp, as the rest of the raiding party will have already gotten there. If you get aggroed on the way there, see above on drawing agro on the way. <br><br>The day of the raid: The first camp <br><br>Stay at the camp. Now is not the time to wander or explore. If you want to do that, use an emulator that will allow you to explore the zone offline. Now is also not the time to practice your safe fall. Stay below the ½ way point of the wall. <br><br>The puller will proceed to pull mobs from around the zone. Get used to this spot, at least half the first floor mobs will be fought from here. <br><br>Watch the raid channels. If a pull goes bad, you need to know when the order is given for the clerics to camp out. If a mob drops no-drop armor for your class you need to know so that when /random starts to happen, you dont have to ask what it is for, and if you are the only person of your class, or the only person of your class who needs that particular piece, you can loot it before it rots. <br><br>Once everything that is going to be pulled to the first camp has been destroyed, the order will be given to move to the Organ Hall. <br><br>The day of the raid: The Organ Hall <br><br>The rules for moving to the Organ Hall are the same as moving to the first camp. Follow the raid leader or the puller. If you are aggroed, stay and die. If Inny shouts your name /q <br><br>The Organ Hall its self is fairly safe. Now is the time to sit, med, heal, etc, staying away from the walls. Also, do not sit on the throne. I have yet to find out exactly why, but I suspect it has the possibility of aggroing something. Casters need to sit closer to the throne, melees closer to the door. <br><br>The puller will proceed to pull the rest of the first floor mobs to this spot. Once again, get used to it, you will be here for a while. <br><br>Watch the raid channels. If a pull goes bad, you need to know when the order is given for the clerics to camp out. If a mob drops no-drop armor for your class you need to know so that when /random starts to happen, you dont have to ask what it is for, and if you are the only person of your class, or the only person of your class who needs that particular piece, you can loot it before it rots. <br><br>Once all of the mobs have been pulled, it is time to take on the Maestro. Time to buff, heal, and med again. Some guilds have everyone log to the chat server at this point and re-log in after everyone is buffed. Mages need to start mass-producing mod rods again and dropping them on the floor. This will allow the clerics to be able to quickly replenish their mana during the battle, it might mean surviving or dying. <br><br>Once all the prep-work is done, the puller will pull the maestro. Casters need to stay back, as he grav-fluxes and this hurts. A lot. He will come down eventually, and you can congratulate yourself on a job well done. <br><br>If the goal of the raid is only the first floor, you are finished. You can wait for things to re-spawn and kill them again, or you can get your friendly wizard or druid to port you out. <br><br>If the goal of the raid is to do the entire plane, you will continue on to the second floor. I have never been to the second floor, so I do not have the knowledge to write a guide for it. <br><br><br>The day after the raid <br><br>The raid leader or guild vault keeper will have had a chance to get all the loot together, and anything that is not no-drop will be distributed at this time. All jewels or jewelry that was looted will either be sold to cover the costs of the peridots and port stones and to fund the next raid or made into jewelry for people in the guild. <br>General Plane rules <br><br>Do not use pets (except Wizard pets which do not draw agro) <br><br>Do not use AoE spells as they can draw agro from the second floor. <br><br>Do not use DOT spells, as they will make mobs unmezzable <br><br>Watch the raid channels closely for orders to camp or orders to move <br><br>If you have to camp, do not sit and camp, sitting will draw more agro than standing, use /q instead <br><br>Always, always protect your clerics. They are crucial to the raid. If all the clerics die, CR will be difficult if not impossible without a Necro to summon. <br><br>Do not fall asleep. Dont laugh, it happens. If you feel like you are going to fall asleep, let the raid leader know and have a Wizard TL you out. <br><br>Do not gate or evac out. You will not be able to come back up unless you are prepared to pay 200-300 pp for a port stone and there is a mage present to CoH you. <br><br>If you show up and the raid has already started, do not ask if its too late to come unless you are prepared to pay 200-300 pp for a port stone and there is a mage present to CoH you. <br><br>Do not demand that the puller pull specific mobs. They will eventually be gotten to when it is time. The mobs will be pulled in an order that makes it more likely that you will live to tell about it. <br><br>Any questions you have, ask your group leader. They will relay them when appropriate. <br><br>Do not break mez unless you are the MA. <br><br>Come to the raid expecting to die. It happens to everyone, you can be rezzed. <br><br>Do not come to the raid expecting XP a raid is about taking down some hard mobs and possibly getting some cool items or armor. <br><br>If you dont get something you wanted, dont whine about it. There will be other mobs and other raids. <br><br>Write down on your handy paper who is in your group. That way if something happens and the group has to re-form, you know who was in it. <br>If you are a designated buffer, unless the tells for buffs are coming slowly enough that you can keep track of them, its a good idea to keep a list on the paper of who needs what buffs and cross them off when given. <br><br>General fighting rules <br><br>Watch the raid channels. The puller will let everyone know what s/he is pulling and the MA will let everyone know which mob they are attacking first. If the MA needs to switch targets, this will be announced in raid channels as well. <br><br>Do not attack the mob until the MA says to attack in raid channels. <br><br>Sprite Golems and Ashenbone drakes are highly magic resistant. As such, they cannot be mezzed. The MA will switch targets to these, allowing the other mob to be mezzed. If you are a caster, do not waste your mana on trying to cast on them, the spells will be resisted. <br><br>Casters, do not cast on a mob till it is about 70% dead. Allow the melees some time to build hate. <br><br>Do not let the mobs run. If you have been assigned to be the designated snarrer, snare the mob when it is at half health. <br><br>If you are attacked while in the camp, do not run around like a chicken with it;s head cut off. Either stand where you are, or run towards the melees. Use your Im being attacked hotkey. <br><br>Always, always protect your clerics. They are crucial to the raid. If all the clerics die, CR will be difficult if not impossible without a Necro to summon. Did I say this twice? I meant to. Its one of the most important things. <br><br>If the call has been given for the clerics to camp, watch until they are out. Once they are out, you have 2 choices. You can fight to the death, or take your chances with a /q /qing is better; it means less rezzes for the clerics to have to do. <br><br>If someone has handed their mod rod to a cleric, they should ask a mage for another. Its generally a good idea to have a hotkey made for this to ask in /tell <br><br>If there has been a wipeout, upon respawning at the bind point, mages should start making mod rods and handing them to the others that have died. This way, there are some already made before rezzes since a rez drains all mana. After being rezzed, the mod rod should be handed to the cleric to regain some of the mana spent on the rez. After looting the body, the rezee should ask the cleric if they need the other rod that had been on the corpse. <br><br>General looting rules <br><br>Each group should have a master looter. When looting mobs, the looter should announce in the proper raid channel what it dropped. Example: /ooc %t dropped coin, gems, and no drop bard armor <br>If it drops no-drop stuff, during the next lull, it will be looted following guild looting rules. <br><br>If it drops something that is not no-drop, it should be looted and kept. <br><br>After the raid is over, all items and money will be handed to the guild vault keeper. The money will be used to pay for the raid and to foot the bill for the next one. Any items will be distributed the next day. <br><br><br>If you havent noticed, the keys here are being prepared, keeping your clerics safe and supplied with mana, and keeping screen-clogging chat to a minimum. <br><br>I hope this guide can be of use to people, and possibly make their experience raiding hate much more enjoyable-or at least keep the bad stuff to a minimum. <br>Oh, yeah.
