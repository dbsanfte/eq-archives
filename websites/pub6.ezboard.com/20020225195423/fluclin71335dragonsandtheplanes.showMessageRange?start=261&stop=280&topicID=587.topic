I did not have my pearl before I added myself to the list.  I had assumed that I was not allowed to add myself unless I had the pearl.  I learned otherwise and added myself.  Mainly becuase I felt that I could get the pearl before my time on the list and I did not want to wait 6 months as I plodded from the back of the line.  Sure that may be selfish, but I was only working within the rules.  The plain fact is, to move the people without pearls now, would defy the trust they put into this system as they asked to be added.  I don't mind waiting.  Then again, I dont know how many in front of me do not have their pearls.  Thanks for listening..<br>

<br>
The list will remain as is.  I have suggested those without a pearl volunteer to move themselves, but in no way will i move anyone for getting on the list under the loophole at the time.<br>
<br>
Just a side note.  I get about 4 - 5 emails a week from folks who want to get on the list.  None of them have thier pearls and I have added none of those people.  Since the pearl rule has been enforced hard I have added 1 person in 5 weeks to the list, and 4 people have gotten thier epics and moved off the list.  So any more great fear of a huge list swelling is curbed for the time being.<br>
<br>
I have found that a few folks get angry at first when I tell them I won't add them without a pearl.  After I explain it to them most seem to calm down and Understand.  I get the reply that they know of a few on the list who have not even started the quest, and while that may be true they got in before the enforcement.<br>
<br>
It is true, I do have my epic and have had it since February.  I keep up this list due to popular demand and support.  I even saw somewhere in this thread or an email I got that I maintain this list so my friends and guildies can get special treatment.  This boggles my mind.  I have 2 guildies on this list and they were added to the last open slot at the time.  I like to consider all the clerics on this list my friends, so that arguement does not hold water.  I get no compensation at all for this job.  I get no PP under the table to move stuff around.  I do this simply to help out.  I know how much my epic meant to me, and I think everyone should get a fair shot at it without having to worry much about KSing and all the nasties I read about on other servers.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for your support and kind words.<br>

As I said in my earlier post, in no way was I questioning Fayenae's ability or integrity.  I know that no GM would ever give us real customer support; my previous comments were more rhetoric than anything.  However, I would like it if they did.<br>
<br>
I do have a few more comments that I would like to add to the fray of discussion.<br>
<br>
First, the lack of communication to clerics beginning the quest.  How are they supposed to know about the list?  How are they supposed to know that they are supposed to get on this list before they start camping Ragefire?  Is there a way to communicate the need to be on the list other than putting up with the dunder heads at the spawn that won't show any consideration for lack of knowledge on this spawn's protocol?<br>
<br>
Second, I agree with Troy that the clerics on the list without pearls should be given a time frame to work within.  One month should be a sufficient amount of time for those on the list without pearls to get them (the fact that I go that far even surprises me), however, there are some that do not have that long because they should get to the top of the list before then, Bijinko being the first of that category.  For those that reach the top without a pearl, I suggest removing them until they do get their pearl.  When they do, they should be put at the back of the list.  Some of you may wonder why I seem to be so harsh.  I would compare having the pearl to going to the store to buy something.  Imagine, you get in line to buy your items only to discover that you don't have any money on you.  What are your options?  1) Get out of line, go home, get your money, then get at the back of the line or 2) borrow the necessary materials from someone else so that you don't have to resort to option number one.  Unfortunately in our case, the second option does not exist.  If the second option did exist, then there would be a plethora of people capitalizing on it.<br>
<br>
Third, I have a problem with people that respond irrationally when someone questions why and what other people are doing.  I will leave that up to the rest of you to determine who responded that way to my earlier post.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, and this is intended more as a response to Mystala than anything, anonymity is a wonderful thing.  I knew there was going to be some person or people that would respond irrationally to my questioning.  Knowing that, I intentionally created an account to preserve that anonymity and to save myself the effort of putting anyone on my ignore list.  However, you must remember that not everybody participates in the message boards nor does everyone know that this particular thread exists.  In fact, my earlier post was my first. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueayenaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eayenaf</A> at: 5/11/01 7:52:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufayenae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fayenae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 302<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 7:22:48 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Ragefire spawns:  reservation/rotation list</span><hr size=1> Oh, and to address one more concern. No one has made it to the Rage part and not had the pearl, so far.  If someone does do that there will be NO waiting on them. They penalty is harsh, to the bottom they go.  Why?  Because they wasted our time and a spot on the list for a quest they were either A) not really into doing, or B)not capable of doing.<br>
<br>
So I make this warning to the people on the list without a pearl, get to it. Don't let your time sneak up on you and you not be ready, the penalty is not good.<br>
<br>
Hope this answers your question.  We will accept NO excuse from anyone who gets to Rage and has no pearl.<br>

<br>
Let me re-iterate my concerns here.  What Fayenae has just suggested is not a harsh penalty; they are still on the list.  The only penalty you are suggesting is to move them to the bottom.  With your suggested punishment the problem still exists -- people without pearls are still on the list.  With the mentality of what you have suggested, a case could be made to keep people on the list that fail at the attempt to kill Ragefire, which is wrong.  My solution is as it was in my post above -- remove them completely from the list if they reach the top of the list without a pearl.  The second stipulation I suggested is to give those people on the list without a pearl a time frame to get the necessary quest materials; this is to prevent people without pearls from exchanging places with others on the list that do have pearls indefinitely, perpetuating the problem of having people on the list without pearls.<br>
<br>
Now for my other concern which was not addressed, I will re-post it here.<br>
<br>
BEGIN REPOST:<br>

I don't mind answering them, but I do wish you could step up to the plate with your real name.<br>
<br>
Ok, here we go again.  If you were to get to the top of the list and not have a pearl you would fall to the back, BUT would it not make sense that that could not happen since no one is being added to the list with no pearl?  So more or less it would be a &quot;bye, come see us when you do the quest&quot;.<br>
 Again, my concern over what you think is diminishing with each anon post you make. Sorry.<br>
<br>
Now, as a matter of communication, this works the same as the caleneder.  Sure some may not know about it, but most do.  This list is pretty famous, and I stay on top of each and every person that is on it.  They all tell me when they have killed Ragfire and most of the time the tell the next cleric in line.  I get emails and tells from folks who I have never heard of or seen, but they all know me and they know of this list.<br>
<br>
I am glad to answer any questions that anyone has, but there are 14 pages to this thread that contain just about any answer you need.  I also am going to stop debating with an anon poster.  You do not have to change your account name, just add your sig to your post.  Make you a more respectable debater if you have the balls to reap the hell or praise from your posts.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

You don't just waltz into the bottom of Chardok with your average pickup group and get the note from the Overking or take down Ixiblat that easily.<br>
<br>
However, I do agree.  Failure to have the pearl when your name comes up should result removal from the list until you do have it.  This puts them right along with everyone else who is at the same stage of the quest.  Putting them at the bottom serves no real purpose other than to take a slot from someone who does have theirs.<br>

I dont expect any of the few pearless in front of me to not get their pearl. My thought are more directed at the large group of pearless between the three pearl holders at the back of the line.<br>
<br>
Anon poster - I promise you that no Cleric that has their pearl is unfamiliar with this list. There are some things you just learn in EQ. If it was just a list that every cleric needed to get on to reserve a place I would agree that it would not be fair to all. <br>
<br>
My thoughts on a Deadline - I do not think it would be unreasonable to set a deadline for the Pearl, as long as it was at least a month. You could do start to pearl in that amount of time fairly easy. The idea would just be that it would seperate those that are truely moving forward with the quest from those that are not, I would not expect anyone to not get this done if they asked to do so. After all they have all been on this list a while and I would hope they would at least started. If the clerics without a pearl work together they could all get their staffs one day and get their notes in a couple of day long trips to Chardok.<br>
<br>
I want to see this list to be a success for a long long time. I dont like feeling like I am pushing this so hard. That is truely not my intention. I just feel like we can get it done and not only the people on the list but the people signing up will all be better off. I mean we are talking about clerics here. I know we can help each other make a push on this and in a months time there would be a lot less tension when someone comes to sign up. The only gripe they would have at that point would be that they did not get their Pearl sooner.<br>
<br>
One last thing. Fay could you post you thoughts on swapping places? If someone leaves do you think it is ok for them to give their spot away? Or what if nothing changes and they are getting close to Rage and they swap places with someone behind them? I know this has been brought up several times and I dont recall ever seeing a good reason for allowing swaps. I also know this has not been a big problem but it would be nice if it was spelled out in the rules that if you quit EQ you lose your spot.<br>
<br>

Just disrequard my post as it is obviously not what anyone thinks would be in the best interest of a successful list. Heck the list is already a success. <br>
<br>
Also Lerwin I know you swapped places and that is fine. However I also know that it would make everyone feel better if they all got a free move up in line rather than one person getting the move up. Does that make sense? There is no way in the world we will let Bjinko get to the top with no note. She has a thousand friends and though she does not know me well I am one of them.<br>

Every other server has a horrible atmosphere of hatred and vengeance based on large part on this, guilds who ordinarily are friendly to one another going to outright enemies barely on speaking terms the next day over a Rage incident. Couple clerics and monks sitting in Naggy's lair spewing insults at each other, and describing how &lt;insert name of huge guild here&gt; can easily trample the other clerics also waiting, so they shouldn't bother trying. The insane mad rush to solb, jumping your army right over the groups a cleric who has waited twice as long as you are assembling. Finding that Rage has been spawned before you could get there, but your raid saying &quot;heck with it, it's ours anyway&quot;, and ksing it, thoroughly screwing whoever spawned it. Really, our little utopia we've got here is the envy of every other server.<br>
<br>
I admit that there *might* be some clerics who have started the quest not knowing of this list, but this list is so famous and well-known on the server, that by the time the big major encounters in BW and Chardok come up,requireing huge raids filled with people who undoubtably do know of the list, well before they have the pearl, I'd find it hard to believe that the cleric wouldnt find out.<br>
<br>
Now, getting that out of the way, my own opinion though on this issue, which really is a minor one, because it will probably no longer be an issue at all in a few more weeks. Whatever happens with this issue is no real big deal honestly. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I think we should keep whoever's on the list for now, with just two little changes. First, only clerics with (P) should be allowed to switch places for any reason. Otherwise, a cleric without a pearl could stay near the top forever by trading places all the time. Second, if a cleric does reach the top and doesnt have the pearl, they really should be dropped. It wouldn't be fair to let them stay at that point to the clerics who now cant get on the list without the pearl. Putting them back at the bottom would be like re-adding a cleric who doesnt have a pearl. In this case, one cleric is allowed to be re-added to the bottom of the list, while others could not get added to the bottom of the list.<br>
<br>
Other than those two things, and both of them are honestly pretty minor concerns, and even with those 2 possible issues still in place, this list is fantastic, and I commend Fayenae for her selfless work on this. I can only imagine how much of a huge hassle this is, but someone's gotta do it, given the alternative, and that someone sure as heck wont be a GM. ; ) <p>Cayleu Starshine

Should Fayenae be banned for the &quot;flaming&quot; she just gave to me?  I hope not.  It is often in the light of rational thinking that irrational and derogatory remarks are made, even by Fayenae.  As I said in one of my previous posts &quot;...anonymity is a wonderful thing.

<br>
If it is a debate, then nobody has given any logical arguments as to why we should keep those people without pearls on the list.  However, I am not trying to debate, I am trying to institute a change where I see a flaw.  The flaw is in the thinking that putting someone without a pearl at the back of the list is a punishment -- they are still there.  In fact, they will still be in front of anybody else that comes along after them with a legitimate claim to Ragefire.  Why not remove them completely and only re-add them to the end of the list when they do get the pearl?  In the context of my shopping/check-out example, those people should not be there at all, but even I am willing to give them a time frame to get that done.  I don't think it should be an indefinite amount of time though.  That is why I have stated that there are two reasons why those people without pearls should be removed: 1) they reach the top of the list and still don't have a pearl or 2) they don't get the pearl within a specified amount of time.  Is that too much to ask or are you performing this role so that you can tell people what they can and cannot do? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucayleustarshine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cayleu Starshine</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 10:36:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Ragefire spawns:  reservation/rotation list</span><hr size=1> It doesn't matter if I agree or disagree, an anon poster is someone who did not have the courage to stand up for what they believe in.

<br>
I am going to type this out for you one more time.<br>
1. NO ONE will be removed from the list.<br>
<br>
2.  IF they get to Ragefire with no pearl they will be dropped and have to wait to get the pearl to get on the list.  That pretty much is understood.  I the beginning they would have fallen to the back of the list, but no one can be added to the back of the list without a pearl now, so they can't be added until they get a pearl.  Then they wil be at the end of the list.  Hence, they will fall to the back of the list.<br>
<br>
3.  This list is famous, well known, and works well.  Most on Luclin know about it, not saying all, but they will find out about it at some point.  <br>
<br>
Again, i listen to all suggestions, but please don't come here anon because you don't want to get ingame tells and start saying you have found problems you want fixed.  It don't fly.  Part of solving a problem is taking all the flak and praise that comes with it.  I have NO ONE on my ignore list and I head this thing up. (well no one that has to do with this list)  If anyone would get flamed in game it would be me.  I have had heated discussions, but part of working through a problem may be a heated discussion.  Facts of life.<br>
<br>
Oh, and don't start that &quot;ban Fayenea for flaming me&quot; crap.  Anyone reading this will see I flamed no one. I only stated the obvious.  Oh, and the last person inthis game who would flame and torture you in tells is me.  I am a cleric, i am too busy to argue in tells with someone for no reason.<br>

<br>
Troy,<br>
<br>
AsS far as switching places goes it is allowed as long as I do not see an abuse of it.  Yes, that is a good idea to not let non pearl holders do any switching (real real good idea in fact).  I use my judgement when it comes to switching names around, especially when it does not affect the people around the switchers.  If i ever hear of and selling spots both people will be booted from the spot.  People who leave the game are immediately removed.  Example is Jascenta; she made a huge post about her leaving so the day I read that i removed her.  If she returns to the game she can get her spot back, after she gets the pearl.  She made no note in her post to give he spot to anyone else. I have had some /tells asking for her spot, but she was removed so  in essence has not spot to give away.<br>
<br>
Trading is ok in the right circumstances, as I said.  Going out of town, sickness, emergency's, or anyhting along that line.  If you are leaving the game and are on the list you can give the spot to another ON THE LIST as in Lerwin's case.  He could not have given that spot to a person not on the list already.<br>

To run a business effectively and efficiently, you need training.  With that training, you would be able to determine whether the anonymous person was giving you sound advice or blowing smoke (although this would probably be the more likely case).  If you cannot trust yourself to listen to other people with good ideas, regardless of who they are, then you should not be the one leading these efforts -- you can't trust yourself to listen to others and still be able to make good decisions.  In the context of this discussion, this is not a business.  If it was a business, then can you honestly say that you have training for managing the people of this server?  Do you know what is best for everyone?<br>
<br>
If you would have said that you were going to remove people in the first place, then maybe we wouldn't be having this discussion at this point Fayenae.  A simple, &quot;I agree that they should be removed&quot; would have sufficed.  Why then did you drag this out?  Saying that people will be moved to the back of the list is one thing, removing them is another.  You had NOT previously said &quot;IF they get to Ragefire with no pearl they will be dropped and have to wait to get the pearl to get on the list.&quot;  What you did say was &quot;If you were to get to the top of the list and not have a pearl you would fall to the back&quot;.  If you want to convey a point, then be clear about it.  Falling to the back of the list is a completely different concept than removing people from the list.<br>
<br>
Lastly, what does &quot;NO ONE will be removed from the list&quot; mean?  Nobody will be removed from the list even if they still don't have a pearl in a month's time frame?  A month's time frame seems to be a poplular choice -- one that was suggested by someone else.  Is not a month's time frame enough for a player to fully demonstrate, using your words, &quot;A) really into doing [the quest], [and] B) capable of doing [the quest]&quot;?  Honesty and integrity may be virtues that you hold, but clear communication and logical thinking are not. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueayenaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eayenaf</A> at: 5/11/01 2:10:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufayenae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fayenae</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 309<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/11/01 3:47:00 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Ragefire spawns:  reservation/rotation list</span><hr size=1> You have dragged me through an arguement longer than I wanted to be.

<br>
In case you missed I am not removing anyone in a month, week, 2 months, a year, nothing.  The people on this list who are here prior to the pearl rule will remain.  This is called &quot;grandfathered&quot; in.  <br>
<br>
One of the ideas I like was not letting anyone without a pearl do any kind of moving on the list.  This rule seems fair since there is no need to move anyone without it any closer to the front.  They have thier spots and better hold on to them since they are lucky enough to be here without a pearl.<br>
<br>
Now, please leave this subject alone.  We have taken up to much of this thread with this pointless bickering.  Create another thread like others have in the past.  If it seems I have turned unreasonable then you may be right. I grow tired of playing games with an anon poster who is only here to &quot;start trouble&quot; as I was told by a few in game this afternoon.  You have no other real intentions in mind as far as I or any other reader can tell.   If you do indeed have a cleric, get your pearl and get on the list.<br>
<br>
You are turning this into a flame and I will no longer respond to any of your concerns here.  If you wish start a thread in flames and rants, although I suggest you not do it anon since the pros like Chakan and Large will tear you up.  As I said before, anon poster hold no real opinion.  And yes I blow them off regardless of how good thier points are.  Hehe, I don't know where you got the idea that I was any different to anon posters.<br>
<br>
I apologize to all the others out there reading this, and please direct all flames to this poster to a new thread in the flmaes and rants section.  I do not want to have the moderators move this thread or them go through and edit it.<br>
