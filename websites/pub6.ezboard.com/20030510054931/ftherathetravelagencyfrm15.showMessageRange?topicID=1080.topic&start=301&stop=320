<br>
When I first heard about this, I was thinking - &quot;How can Zut kill Zland when he was having problems soloing Yeldema.&quot; Sure there's a lot of factors when killing Yeld because of adds, but still. Zut has suprised me in the past, but I still doubt this was a success, unless he used an exploit. I haven't talked to Zut so I cannot confirm nor can I say he did not kill Zland.<br>
<br>
A few things we all have to remember. NO ZLAND was lost in the cycle (that is if Zland pops tonight, I have to confirm that first). If servers were down on Sunday morning, and ED killed their Zland that evening, than there is no way that Zut could have killed Zland since he hasn't spawned. Zut could not have killed Zland before server reset because he wasn't due to pop yet. So that leaves the question. What Zland was lost on the rotation? NONE. If no Zland was lost, there shouldn't be any form of punishment. However, if a Zland was lost somewhere, than yes I expect RTA to punish us according to the set standard rules.<br>
<br>
For me personally if I was a guild leader, when a member approaches me with a crazy idea like this, I would have laughed in his face and said go for it. I would have told him go for it and have fun doing a CR. It hasn't been done before, and I don't believe it'll ever happen unless an exploit was used. If an exploit was used, than SoE will handle it. And if he did manage to kill it using an exploit, than SoE will handle the exploit, and the guild will be responsible for the lost Zland.<br>
<br>
One other thing also. Does everybody believe everything that is said on these forums? So how come nobody took Brig's CT post seriously? I mean SoY has been checking on CT the last few days and haven't seen him up? Brig could have killed it, since he claimed he killed it and someone heard him kill it? <br>
<br>
Don't you guys also think that maybe we are just playing you guys. Maybe we just wanted to see how the RTA would react, and now we know how they would react.<br>
<br>
I personally respect the RTA rules. I know what they are, and I like how the rotations are setup. I am actually thankful that we have the rotations setup so that I can enjoy some of the higher end contents of the game. Sure I did say that I would allow him to try to solo Zland, but that is a far fetch crazy idea. He wouldn't succeed without an exploit.<br>
<br>
Again, unless Zland doesn't pop tonight or the next day, there is NO Zland lost, so there shouldn't be any form of punishment. If a Zland was found missing, than yes I expect RTA to punish us for one member's crazy soloing actions. Until than, don't get worked up too much about it. Sure SoY lost some of our reputation, but it's ok. We weren't really liked on the RTA anyways.<br>
<br>
Speaking of internal punishment for Zutan, we will handle those by ourselves and does not concern other guilds or the RTA. We will do what we see fit if we did anything wrong. All I can say is Zutan is a good member and hasn't done anything wrong in the past. Maybe this was his way of a joke, but it sure got some people pissed off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dovelyngoldenheart>Dovelyn Goldenheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Less post, m0 play!</span><br>  Posts: 876<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/7/03 8:43:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1080.topic&index=303>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Zland Rotation</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Don't you guys also think that maybe we are just playing you guys.

<br>
First off - Nilasu, you asked why Brig wasn't slammed for the Cazic Thule post? I don't know, maybe if we read through the post...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Please add Brigandier to the Cazic Thule Rotation.<br>
<br>
Oh shit..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmm, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Oh shit..</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> might give something away. I'm guessing he only posted it about Cazic Thule because of a post about Cazic in Public forums. I can't find it, but I saw someone say they've been waiting for him.<br>
<br>
Someone seeing him do it? Hrmm...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No, this time, I actually saw him do it. I didn't hear about anything.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Oh SHIT! Wait, who posted that...? Jeshter, maybe?!<br>
<br>
BTW, it was Jeshter that posted that SoY is waiting for Cazic Thule. Isn't that ackward? <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showMessage?topicID=589.topic" target="top">Refer to this.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Brig also posted that in the Flame part. That just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be why no one took it seriously?<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
Alright, now that is answered.. let's get to what Dov asked..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Don't you guys also think that maybe we are just playing you guys. Maybe we just wanted to see how the RTA would react, and now we know how they would react.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree with Dov on the questions she asked. Although, I have my own question - If this was a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;joke&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then why didn't Zutan say so after there were about 9 pages of this? I have a lot of respect for Ken, but here's a thought. If I was a guildleader and I found out one of my members soloed a rotation mob, I personally WOULD laugh about it. But then, as an after thought, i'd ask questions to that person.<br>
<br>
If Ken saw this getting out of hand, why didn't he contact Zutan about it? Make Zutan tell the TRUTH, without beatting around the bush like he has been?<br>
<br>
I'm so sick and tired of people alwas &quot;leading&quot; to the point of things. Saying something but not to the fulliest. <br>
<br>
&quot;I may have done this..&quot; - &quot;Oh really? How?&quot; - &quot;How do you think?&quot; - Stuff like that. Ken's a good guy but he reminds me of someone I use to know. People have to remember that everyone isn't the same. A lot of, sorry to say, MEN - Are so thickheaded that the will NEVER apologize for something in their life, even when they know they were wrong to begin with. My dad is like that, one thing I hate about the man. I love him, but I don't ever want to be remembered like that.<br>
<br>
Personally, i'm not so sure I believe he did it or not, but what gets my feathers in a ruffle is that he won't say the exact words about it. SoY won't force him to do it. It's like beating a dead horse <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jeshterdaggerfury>Jeshter Daggerfury</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/7/03 9:44:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1080.topic&index=305>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Zland Rotation</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Zutan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Yes, but that's not an excuse to carry a lie on like this. Considering his own guildleader started to back him up about the &quot;lie&quot; but then realized how bad that'd be. I would think backing out of such a thing from the beginning would of been a safe bet.<br>

If you read through this thread, then you'd know that it really isn't about &quot;My dick is bigger then yours.&quot; It's more along the lines of breaking rules/lying about them in general. People have said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>IF</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> he did solo Zland, more power to him and congrats. Keeping order on this server is a great thing.

Ill bet he is too. Whether its a joke or not. He obviously doesnt care about his guild, his friends, or have any respect for others on the server. Therefore, his actions (be they limited to this board or in game) have given him a good chuckle. If my guildee did this, I sure as hell wouldnt be laughing, and they wouldnt be in my guild. SoY is on my shitlist, people who wear a tag that represents what they've shown here are no friends of mine.<br>
<br>
I, however, hold no ill will toward them. I hope they get their shit together and things like this dont happen, but given the attitude of their leadership (barring k??? the one officer who posted intelligently), I dont see that in the near future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therealdrache>TheRealDrache</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A great example of...<BR>

The night after the Zland post was made, at about 2 am, I looked at the rotations and saw SoY was up for CT, so I made a parody (to an extent) of this thread, as a joke, of course.<br>

Its just a coincidence that CT isn't spawning, <br>

<br>
There is NO evidence that Zland was killed. All spawns are accounted for, and the pop and kill on the 7th confirms that. You cannot punish someone for something that could not have happened. As Rog stated in his posting: if there had been another unaccounted zone downtime for DN, or a repop as Kenau refers to, the pop on the 7th could not have happened. I cannot accept a ruling that disregards this simple fact. <br>
<br>
 BTW: I find it appaling that members of the guild you are trying to judge over should not be able to voice their opinion here. That is despicable.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a
