align=left class=m><span class=title>   An analogy of what SoT did with suggestions to make amends.</span><hr size=1> <br>
Previous attempts to compare what SoT has done with real life situations or those members of SoT who have made attempts to show how sticking with each other through good and bad times, have made me consider how I could compare what SoT did and how it might affect a community.  To this end I give you this analogy and some suggestions of making amends after.<br>
<br>
Lets say you have a community.  Within this community you have churches.  Each with it's on congregation.  In EQ this is comparable.  Each congregation has its friends within and without the church.  Now lets say that one church is waiting to receive a shipment of a Sacred Icon.  Gleefully anticipating the shipment to arrive that day.  But upon the time of the pickup problems occur which result in a slowdown in the ability of the church to get the Sacred Icon.  Another church who also has a need for this Sacred Icon swoops in and takes it right from under the noses of the church who was supposed to get it.<br>
<br>
Now, would this cause an uproar within the community?  Most likely.  And there might even be people within the church, who did the stealing, that might break ranks and tell all about how the dirty deed was done.<br>
<br>
This would lead to shunning, denial, accusations, community disrespect.  There also may be infighting within the church accused of the theft until some sort of amends is made.  These are all aspects that are currently being displayed on EQ.<br>
<br>
That is my analogy and I believe one that fits right inside what is happening within The Rathe.<br>
<br>
Now how could amends be made for this recent tragic event that might make those of us OUTSIDE SoT and CoN feel better about what happened to Trompen?  Should &quot;I&quot; even be making a suggestion since I was not there during the incident?  I believe that everyone who feels this situation was detrimental to Trompen and The Rathe community as a whole deserves to know what may be done to make amends.  Amends being besides the fact that SoT has said they will get Trompen his Ragefire piece.  Considering the fact that Trompen lost so many days sitting at the camp, I feel more amends need to be taken.<br>
<br>
To this end I suggest to SoT that they have each and every culprit that was at the incident and participated in it, to INCLUDE Shei, sit at the Ragefire camp one by one, without other members present, for an approximate time equaling the time that Trompen sat the Ragefire camp.  I would wish that they sit the entire time, as he did, non stop but I do not believe anyone in SoT would be willing to do that.  Someone should be willing to monitor each and every culprit's log time to insure that they sit the Ragefire camp and if they log off or leave the camp, the time stops until they log on again or return to the camp and at that time the monitored time would then again continue.  SoT should also post who is currently sitting the camp to let those of us on The Rathe know who's on the rotation of the Ragefire camp serving his/her time.<br>
<br>
Is this sufficient?  Doubtful, but it would make a lot of people happier.  Will they do it?  Would they do it?  Again, it's doubtful.<br>
<br>
Since a lot of you are saying that the epic piece probably won't be/can't be transferred, I would also suggest that the Cleric who received the Epic item instead of the rightful owner, Woodspast I believe the name is, either destroy the piece gotten if he hasn't gotten his click stick yet, or he destroys his epic all together and starts over.  Would SoT allow that to happen?  Again it's doubtful but it would be a major accomplishment.  Did he participate in the incident?  I really don't care.  He was the RECIPIENT of the epic piece.  He didn't deserve it and doesn't deserve to have his epic considering he didn't sit the Ragefire camp for any length of time.<br>
<br>
I will probably get flamed for this but it's my analogy and my suggestions.  Have at me.<br>

I happen to know Trompen from an old guild and this couldnt have happened to a nicer guy...and its my understanding that he has some RL issues to work out and cant do the camp again.

<br>
I think your plan has good intentions, but its not realisitc, and i feel its also very excessive.  Trompen lost alot, that much is given, but having someone destroy the epic seems like a waste more than anything.  I also think its just a waste of time for each SoT member to camp ragefire on his own.  That is a complete and utter waste of people's lives and time.  It solves NOTHING, other than give people a moral support<br>

The cleric epic seems pretty easy to me, for SoT anyway.  They can waltz in Chardok and kill the King pretty easily.  Ixiblat?  Again, easy.  The only difficult part of it for a guild SoT's size is Ragefire and the time involved.<br>

Well it was a suggestion.  It's not like SoT doesn't have enough Cleric Epics already that one more will be so important to them.  I feel he doesn't deserve to have his epic the way he received Ragefire.  If he's finished his epic quest then he should destroy it and start over.  Amends need to be made and this is one way to make amends in my opinion.<br>

<br>
The person saying that it's easy for SoT to do most of the cleric epic quest, you are right, it is easy. But do you think it started that way? Do you think SoT was concieved with 80+ level 60 members who know how to play? If you do you are nuts.<br>
<br>
They worked, and competed, and earned everything they have, and everything they are capable of. And they did it on a Rathe that wasn't homophaggot care-bear huggies like it is now.<br>
<br>
CoN has been around a long damn time, and still can't muster up enough people to keep what happened from happening. Put the blame on that, not on the people who know opportunity when they see it.<br>
<br>
Now, as far as me being cool, or hot, or stupid or whatever. Who cares, I'm just a board troll anyways, What I say here may be the complete opposite of the actions I take, but that's my enjoyment who cares. At least I speak my mind instead of swimming upstream to lay my eggs just because that's what all you other lemmings are doing.<br>
<br>
Half you people never post a damn thing here until you get a chance to take a shot at SoT. Why? Because they worked harder than you?<br>
<br>
And you are still crying about it a week later. Just STFU and get on with your game, go camp it again, it's not going anywhere, the gaqme will still be there tommorow, next month, or next year.<br>
<br>
No one cried this much when BoTS trained in fear, or when RF Trained SoT in Growth. At least those situation violated REAL RULES!<br>

Add stealing and jumping over other raids to this list, and I might agree with you.  A few things I can recall... Tindi with Zland, RF with Kland... there was something in NToV where they waited for bots to kill something then parked a mage in there.  <br>
<br>
I hope you're still having fun, Grulnick :-) <p><CENTER>

Grulnick, I don't know you so I won't make or I guess post (since I obviously have them) any opinions I've come to over your reasoning.  Just a couple facts though.<br>
<br>
Yes CoN has been around a long time, one of the first few guilds on the server that is left.  This is no way should have any bearing though on how 'blame' should be placed<br>
<br>
Just because one guild will accept practically any level 60 they can lure to them, be it some of their friends already fell in that trap and they want to follow, or the people don't care what company they have as long as they see the 'end-game' and have a shot at the loot.  And the other guild doesn't have a level limit, does very limited recruiting if any, is usually only concidering applicants that came to them and continue persuing that tag above their heads for typically 2 months before it is ever official.  Neither is grounds to call one guild more successful than the other.  <br>
<br>
You seem to have a very limited view of success, at least in this game.  Some of us aren't out to build the biggest baddest army as fast as possible so we can go around picking on the 'ubermobs' and the 'lesserguilds.'  Believe it or not there are those out there who look at the quality of the person that's behind that toon on the screen.  Review some of the logged /gu of SoT and I think you'll see what I mean.  The 'it feels so good to be so bad' character would have never made it in CoN, nor would 'sad sad' Shei, finding it amusing that he upset people because his instructions lead to someone wasting a week of their life.  One can only assume that the entire guild supports this behavior if their leader watches his members do it and takes no action, then turns around and does it himself.<br>
<br>
I don't even know where I'm going here.  This is what prompted me to post.<br>
<br>
&quot;CoN has been around a long damn time, and still can't muster up enough people to keep what happened from happening. Put the blame on that, not on the people who know opportunity when they see it.&quot;<br>
<br>
So anyway, if you think of a guild less because they don't have enough members on 24/7 for Ragefire even though they've been around 3 years, than you think of a large guild who would jump at any opportunity to better themselves with no regard to others.  Then that has to be the saddest thing relating to EQ I've ever heard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrulnick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grulnick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Conscript</span><br>  Posts: 359<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/27/02 10:49:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Analogy</span><hr size=1> Well, first off, they don't let just any ole level 60 join. They have to try out, and the memberbase is not as big as you think.<br>
<br>
If you want to referance a guild that DOES let any ole person in, referance Tindi Losi.<br>
<br>
As for whatever else you said, it doesn't matter the fact remains that no rules were broken.<br>
<br>
Even in the old RF camp, you had to have enough there at ALL times to keep the FGs down, You don't need that in Skyfire, but if you are gonna apply the gentlemans agreement from old RF to new RF then apply that too, and you still lose. <p>Pictures are worth a thousand words.

<br>
This is the 1000x repeated, worn out sock argument, but it is still a fact:<br>
<br>
At 12:00 noon cst, most guilds are not on line with numbers to kill nearly anything, while SoT is.<br>
<br>
It is 100% an invalid argument to state that CoN ' can't muster up enough people to keep what happened from happening'.  It's simply not true.  If you qualified it with 'can't muster up enough people to keep what happened from happening in the early mornings' it would be close to the truth.<br>
<br>
Even more importantly, NO one should ever have to 'keep what happened from happening'.  'what happend' was a legal (by the book) KS, but it was in spirit a KS.  I can understand it happening on more cut throat servers, but not on the Rathe.<br>
<br>
But again, there sould be absolutely no need on my server to ever have to muster forces to prevent this kind of thing.<br>

<br>
If your goal on here is to create controversy, you do a good job of it.  Any time a serious discussion goes on and someone with no mentality and the love of swimming upstream will get attention.  Problem is no one takes you seriously.  I don't.<br>
<br>
If your goal is to divert attention away from the truth, that isn't working either.  No one cares whether you say SoT did nothing wrong or lean that way anyway.  All people want to know is when you are going to ebay and find some other forum to infest.<br>
<br>
/ignore Grulnick<br>
<br>
Kudos to Emil.  It's amazing how distorted some comments are to say, for example, that BotS or NB face the same blame should they run into trouble getting a sizeable force to do an epic mob in the morning on a workday (US time).  We just can't hang with the big boys I guess. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrulnick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grulnick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toede Conscript</span><br>  Posts: 362<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(3/27/02 12:36:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Analogy</span><hr size=1> You don't see the truth in what I say because you are blinded by your disgust at what you assume and think is a wrong done against an entire community of people.<br>

<br>
So to speak, if its KSable I should do it right? I mean if i can muster up the forces I should be all means steal what i want? just because its not illegal or agains the rules of the game. <br>
<br>
Game of life time:<br>
I see your wife, I decide I want your wife, I either drugyour wife in some form or pay her a huge sum of money or, I convince her to love me over you in some shape or form.<br>
Can I do it? I sure can. Should I do it? By your logic I should.<br>
<br>
However what stops me is a little thing called, morals, or even by god who'd think of it respect. <br>
<br>
SoT disrespected the camp, much like if I did the above I would be disrespecting you and your wife. Simply put, attitudes like yours are what makes governments run and keeps police in business. <br>
<br>
Congratulations, for contributing to the constant downfall of mankind.<br>

<br>
Emil - you say &quot;At 12:00 noon cst, most guilds are not on line with numbers to kill nearly anything, while SoT is.&quot;.  I live in Texas (CST) and I know for a fact that SoT hardly ever has a force on at this time to kill anything that requires a decent sized group of people.  I wish they did start that early because then I would be able to attend more raids because I usually have to be at work at 5pm.  As it is I'm lucky if we have enough people on at 2pm so that we actually raid something before I go to work.  <br>
<br>
The rest of your post I agree with.<br>
