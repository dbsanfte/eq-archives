First off it is a shoulder slot item, and err a sick one at that. So I dunno, I suspect he could put it to use for quite some time.<br>

If a GM can swap the item from one toon to another to fix it, perhaps this individual can petition to have that done as a show of good faith.<br>

I wish I knew this could be done, as I myself have accidently looted a no drop item a couple weeks ago. /em should stay away from the coffee.

I know this because I did it once on a guild raid and the item was transferred to the proper person the next day.<br>
<br>
If I had been playing a game for a week, made a mistake that had 40 people yelling at me and threatening me I'd probably log off too.  The person apologized and then was threatened with training and losing their rep by a bunch of people so I can understand their actions somewhat.<br>
<br>
Yes, the person was powerleveled.  They are the true definition of a twink(ie), lvl 46 and hard on the outside, soft in the middle.  They don't have the knowledge to handle the power their toon has atm, but I don't believe it is their fault.  I place that blame on the friend that powerlevelled them, even though their intentions were good.  Give the pally a chance to make things right by having the item transferred, then hope that their friend guides that person through the game and teaches them what and what not to do.<br>

<br>
Yes if you read my post I admitted I was wrong for Helpin him level. I didnt powerlevel him persay but I have helped him achieve a few levels the rest was done by me telling him the best zones to go to to group with. I gave him the equipment to help him kill the mobs quicker and achieve better results, again i said i was wrong for doing this. Trust me, I have learned a great deal from this experience. <br>
<br>
Secondly, no the back item that he looted is not a big deal to a paladin and definitly not worth looting in front of that many different people and ruin himself completely. It just doesnt make any sense for him to have done that with the intention in his head that he was going to get something uber that he will use for a long time. <br>
<br>
I assure you he will petition in game to have it transferred to the raid leader. whatever the set plan was on loot policy hopefully she can get as many people together that were at the raid that wanted the item. (I understand the logistics of trying to get that many people in one place again with dif play times is going to be hard and possibly impossible, and I am sorry but, is the closest thing i can think of to make it somewhat right)<br>
<br>
As far as Das is concerned even if he is the most respected monk on The Rathe I sent him tells trying to explain the situation and he personally sent me tells how he was just going to delevel and train him. He cut me off from tells 20 minutes after that to come post here. Someone attacks one of your real life friend and calls them a fuckstick, I hope to god you stand by them over someone you dont know on the internet. Especially after you tried very hard to reason with this person. As far as I am concerned he couldn't wait to come here and flame. And to threaten to delevel and train someone? That is just petty.<br>
<br>
My point is i doubt very few people, after a week have the concept of how grave a situation is about just looting an entire raids item really is. Again I admit fault for leveling him too quickly. I have learned my lesson and hope anyone else that reads this learns with me. Perhaps the fact that hes a real life freind and i wanted him to be able to play with my paladin blinded me. <br>
<br>
Again the situation will attempted to be resolved to the best of our ability. He isnt a bad person though and do not hate him or remove him from groups and so forth. If you wish to leave me from your groups I suppose that is fine because I am taking the responsibility for this one. <br>
<br>
If you side with Das you side with Das, but I assure you that his explanation of his char is not the right one, and you will miss out on the chance of meeting a really great person. <br>
<br>
Again Safe and Happy hunting The Rathe<br>

Not if my friend was being a fuckstick.  Knowing him in real life doesn't excuse or minimize the negative impact his actions had on everyone at the raid.  You don't learn not to steal from others at EQ University, you learn it at home from mom and dad early in life.  I don't buy this &quot;he didn't know what he was doing&quot; bit.  Did he not realize how big of a shitstorm something like this can cause for his rep?  Or how important rep is in an online game?  Maybe.  But he knew he was looting the item, and he knew it didn't belong to him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sorcereranyen>SorcererAnyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/8/03 9:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1404.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wortman the ninja </span><hr size=1> The only complaint I ever had about you Karadin was not giving people the benefit of the doubt.

<br>
To echo your post lets clear up a few misunderstandings shall we.<br>
<br>
Interesting observation you made ... &quot;Secondly, no the back item that he looted is not a big deal to a paladin and definitly not worth looting in front of that many different people and ruin himself completely.&quot;<br>
<br>
The next time you plan to debating please do your homework, hell I even cut and pasted the loot for everyone to read. The Ceremonial Kylong Shroud is worn on your SHOULDERS, if you don't beleive me ask Wortman and he will gladly link the item to you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (before he deleted it)<br>
<br>
I love this .... &quot;As far as Das is concerned even if he is the most respected monk on The Rathe I sent him tells trying to explain the situation and he personally sent me tells how he was just going to delevel and train him&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes I admit telling you and Wortman aka &quot;the victim&quot; that I was going to train him and delevel him back to the level he rightfully deserves. Call it petty its more of a scare tactic for morons. Hell he will get right along with the newbs in Befallen and Blackburrow. That was more or less me being angry as hell for camping dragonbone shards for 25 hrs to see some ignorant player ruin a dragon kill after we had wiped the 1st time already. Call it a threat but I got better things to do then train paladins in Kael, he appears to own the rights to that there anyways <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And lastly ... &quot;He cut me off from tells 20 minutes after that to come post here&quot;<br>
<br>
Priceless ... I wasn't cutting you off that was my AFK message haha. It said, now focus your eyes on the screen, I know how things can appear when drunk all fuzzy and stuff .... &quot;AFK - posting on RTA&quot;<br>
<br>
I learned a big lesson yesterday. If you are forming a PICKUP raid please please please only set &quot;leader only&quot;, I give people the benefit of the doubt all the time, I won't make that mistake again at pickup raids.<br>

  <br>
   Having people support you tells me one thing. That you obviuosly are worth standing up for you. The bad thing is this they all swear and curse while supporting you. Obviuosly you are angry. As I would be as well because as players, we all realize how long 25 hours is. A huge amount of time, close to 5 or 6 days for me. <br>
<br>
   I cant say I wouldnt be angry as well but i cant say I would freak out and post as a ninja loot as facts. this wasnt the case I assure you. God knows what was going through his head. All of this will be sorted out soon as I plan on making things right. <br>
<br>
  I dont know what you mean as far as homework though... I dont wear Mana preservation Items on my back or anywhere. Just makes 0 Sense as a paladin. trust me hun I wouldnt want this item and wouldnt pay 500 plat for it as the class I play (although the people I have talked to since then said it was a very good item). Again doing the best I can to make it right.<br>
<br>
  The thing I dont want to see happen is someone get flamed out of the game because of a misunderstanding I have no idea how many more times I can say I regret for helping him as much I have. because he did miss out on some more important things. I had no idea this was going to happen or belive me hun it wouldnt have. <br>
<br>
   You have to believe me when i say I feel bad because I feel awful, truly I do. If I didnt know the kind of person he was or he was just some random person I wouldnt put my neck on the line because of it. <br>
<br>
  All I can do is apologize to you for the time you lost and offer to camp the same items you have ( I am not up to date on this quest just send me a tell and what I have to kill and I will do my best) also to get him to petition in game to have the item transfered to the raid leader. <br>
<br>
   I cant have you calling him a fuckstick though because I swear this wasnt intentional. The fact that you went AFK to post this before I was done explaining this to your shows your Impatience. This is fine if you lost the amount of time you said you lost. I just ask that you realize that not all things are done on purpose or out of evil intentions. <br>
<br>
        I swear to you and anyone that reads this it wasnt done intentionally. I have no idea what you beef is with me for defending my friend, who i know was honest, is but please send me a tell in game and we can have this out and taken care of. <br>
<br>
    Understand Das I do not plan on backing down on this because i know the truth. You will either accept what I have said and see what we do to correct it as proff. Or you will close you eyes and just WANT for some reason to be jaded. <br>
<br>
   I will continue to reply to every post because I have done my homework and I do know the truth. Wortman's act was out of lack of knowledge. You stopped tells with me during conversation to post this message before the conversation was over. You threatened someone who has been playing a week. (again I realize my mistake in robbing certain social interactions by letting him gain levels too quickly). <br>
<br>
   Harbor ill will if you will hun, this is clearly your choice you can either let me do what i can to make things right or you can proceed to be immature and just rant and rave. Totally up to you. Send me a tell in game if you wish to talk. If you wish to continue to try and prove me wrong here you can some will buy it i suppose and you will get whatever sick satisfaction you are getting from this silly debate.<br>
<br>
  It wasnt done out of greed or Ill will.<br>
<br>
  Wortman is not a bad person (not quite ready for the level he is at i admit)<br>
<br>
  Das Just wants to flame and feel jaded. I guess being a marter is good?)<br>
<br>
  I have offered as much evidence and support as possible to this subeject. The people who read this can either decide that wortman is some evil wicked 1 week old ninja looter. Or they can decide that crap does happen. <br>
<br>
  When this is settled as best it can be I will post the results here. <br>
  <br>
  Once again I apologize to LoL and those that feel robbed by it I am working as hard as I can to make things right. If any involved would like me or him to do anything to make it right please dont hesitate to send me a tell in game. <br>

Only the shoulders.<br>

Not to be worn on the back at all. <br>

Ever.<br>

The back is off limits because the shoulders is where it goes.<br>
<br>
Always.<br>
<br>
You click on the item and drag it to the shoulder slot and drop it in. <br>
<br>
Because its for shoulders, not back. <br>

The back isn't the same shape as the shoulders and wouldn't be a wise choice. <br>

<br>
Hopefully we have this whole thing on the way to resolution.<br>
A few things happened. One is I spoke to Wortman today and he apologized again and told me that he destroyed the item.  Then he petitioned  and admitted his wrongdoing.  <br>
<br>
When the GM contacted me re: My petiton he confirmed that no ceremonial kylong shroud was in the possession of Wortman.<br>
<br>
Next thing was that Talcon, Guild Leader of Disavowed and Redeemed ( /notes irony in guild name) contacted Daserack and myself and agreed to farm 4 more  dragon boneshards to replace the ones lost triggering Garudon.<br>
<br>
As of tonight, the guild was already in Veksar farming away.<br>
<br>
Will keep the RTA informed as to shard retrieval, but so far so good in rectifying the mistake.<br>

<br>
  Was a very good post.. Apparently you are so bored with it you felt the need to respond to it.. Whatever dont read it then. Get a life and if you even get the slightest bit off on pointing this out and making such a huge stink about where the slot is then ummm you are a loser. <br>
<br>
<br>
  You know what I think? I am sick of defending it. point is that this is not a Paladin item worth ruining your reputation over. Stop bieng such a dumbass and realize that. If he had a clue at all about it... no where in any sane persons mind someone loot such a meaningless item for that class. Maybe he wanted to transfer it.. not Wait its NO DROP. Want to waste your time with these rediculous posts Drache be my guest. <br>
<br>
  Want to hate me or wortman for a mistake... again be my guest. Personally I have shown as much good will towards this as possible and people still want to flame and be rediculous. <br>
<br>
  Go right on ahead and keep on hating and flame your super witty flames (They are pretty witty too... I am sure you have a spot right at comedy central as soon as you crawl out of your mom's basment waiting for you) <br>
<br>
  In the mean time The shards will be recamped and everything is bieng done possible to make the situation right on this unfortunate mistake. Please keep the super funny posts coming though because they are a riot! I almost fell out of my seat... Ass.<br>
<br>
  You want to talk about this in game too please do so. You want to add insight to the situation then do so. Of course I HIGHLY doubt you are the kind of person that would do anything constuctive... forget all that just go on bieng a jerk. <br>
