(DRUNKEN)</span><hr size=1> Well... what canI say? Here I sit feeling pretty good... just gettin back from a party, and wanting to think about my EQ year... well here goes. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Please note that this is extremely biased and that it is not all inclusive, I'm hoping that you'll all add in your own info and make it correct, as this is something you'll look back upon in the future</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
Events:<br>
<br>
Apex disbanded and formed Endorean.... similar guilds, both having people in common that I enjoyed spending time with and that made the game fun for me. Nice job on your transformation...<br>
<br>
Legacy of Sorrow keeps their status as number 1, being the only to clear ToV and also spawning the only to get into ST and spawning the sleeper. And you killed Tunare... HOLY CRAPP!!! You power gamers are our elite, and you've done well. Debates over whether or not that is good for us is null... it doesn't matter. You were and still are number one... great work, as always. People seem to influx in and out of LoS but you always bounce back to where to want to be, on top.<br>
<br>
We saw the fast rising of Sacred Sanctuary, a guild that seemingly came out of no where to claim the title of #2 on the server after downing Velketer, Dain, Zandiclar, and other such high mobs... and then we saw them quickly leave Norrath again... sad, but your legacy lives on.<br>
<br>
VoS did some great things, and still do. Growing and working each day... Some good peeps, some bad peeps, but always gaining power. But hey! There's about 8 people who used to be in my guild in there!! Woah!! GO VoS!!<br>
<br>
Heroes, doing their thing... big time, on their time. Nuff said... that's all the want to do, and all they need to do.<br>
<br>
Hauka Ryjoran(sp?) reformed into the Asura powerhouse, who reign supreme during the other guilds' off times... rumored to be in the top most powerful guilds on the server.<br>
<br>
CoJ splits or something into Desperatoes, and I don't know enough about that, nor do I want to talk about it in my drunken state... Good thing and bad things come from that, and an old friend from there who used to be in my guild, Delirios, moves to the AB server.... /mourn, cry<br>
<br>
IB and Triad do their things... as always. Up some, down some, always the same vision, and same mobs killed. It's hard to keep growing these days, but they keep from declining, which is equally admirable...<br>
<br>
Ancient Crusade seemed to have taken war on Gorenaire for a while... downing him like an old lady on ice. Well done... that and other things...<br>
<br>
Enough with the big guilds... let me talk of the smaller guilds:<br>
<br>
Glorious Rising works their way onto the VS rotation!! Yes, they did!! Holy crap, nice work Glorious Rising... That says a lot for you...<br>
<br>
Other medium guilds who've done extraordinary things: Veterans Legion, Silent Sentinels, Titans, and Veeshan's Tallons... working up, working, working, and doing amazing things... that surprised me and others. Big stuff, great work. You deserve all that you've earned... There are more guilds like you out there, but there's no way I'll remember them right now...<br>
<br>
Small guild stuff that I can think of off hand while I'm drunk:<br>
<br>
Legion of Ka... whom the legendary Cherrangel used to belong to, as well as Warff, Flear, Robius, Tavokk, and others lives on, but doing their own thing, led by Brytnee... keep it up LoK... bigger isn't necissarily better. Keep doing you thing.<br>
<br>
Knights of Luclin saw a plethora of members leave for larger guilds, as they couldn't keep up and lacked some classes... not a bad thing, more so an adjustment. My guild still honors the alliance we've always had, and we still will.<br>
<br>
Nocturnal Sun grows bit by bit... Jesseika, Tierash, and Skyeklad do a great job...<br>
<br>
Sacraments is formed... doin' their thing... that's cool... &lt;3 Avae<br>
<br>
Mantros changes servers and comes over and starts Hidden Prophecy... a smaller guild but bent on making themselves better and getting places within the game. You can't slight that... not one bit. Noble intentions, good work ethic...<br>
<br>
God damnit, I'm too drunk, and this is a MUCh to huge a topic for me to attempt to completely discuss... I need help when I'm done posting this... please add what you need to...<br>
<br>
People who've left: We've seen a TON of good folks leave... including the legendary Wang, Basheek, Mumsley, etc... lots, more than I care to even think of right now... these are people who shaped the server and their guilds... standouts in this wild ruckus we call Luclin... oh man, and I miss every single one of them.<br>
<br>
Epics: Lots and Lots and LOTS of epics have been obtained this year... holy crap, I cannot even name all of the people who've gotten them. Let's see... Raventod, Duggun, Anng, Meshugugget, Bijinko, Cobee, Caliss, Dinian, Olaric, Selwyn, Beavadien, Mordrok, Sejin, Aset, holy crap, me???!!, and I cannot think of anymore, becauyse I'm wasted... someone has to fill in the gaps here, bec ause there is no way that I can possibly do it.  There are lots who I remember getting theirs in the recent past, but I simply cannot remember them all right now. That's a lot of people to keep track of... I remember a lot, but the molten beer hops in my head are restricting my synopsis receptions in my brain, thus, I cannot think clearly. The ragefire rotation handled by Cayleu lives on, and still works to this day. The Trak and VS rotation handled by Valas still works, and keeps those mobs on a civil rotation and other epics pouring out onto the server. We owe Cayleu and Valas a thanks for keeping such lists fair and unbiased as possible and keeping our server civil. Thanks you two...<br>
<br>
We've seen and lived through the September 11 tragedy, and Bruins Marauders put up a nice bunch of screenshots about it and we all rejoice in the fact that we care... while all hating Chakan for something stupid he says rashly not knowing what was really happening in the world... btu, crap happens, we live on... Our server is still great.<br>
<br>
Milynna steps down as moderator of the boards, and Aenae disappears, and for some reason a stoopid wizard named Bic takes over, trying to bring harmony to the server... yeah riught... more like bring beer toall and recruiting Deris and Larisian to help him in his job. Much appreciated...<br>
<br>
Oh my god.... what else happened? I can't remember, because I'm honestly too dr9ink .;.. notics how when I say I'm drukn, my typing gets worse?? WTF is with that??? But, anyway...<br>
<br>
Many anon posters banned... DIE DIE DIE anon posters!! And annoying flamers, people who use bad words on the main forums, and who post porn!! DIE DIE DIE and be banned!! Deris will eat your babies!!<br>
<br>
A bunch of the people on the server from different areas decide that since no fan fair is coming towards them, that they'll have their own... in NY alone somewho I got Jesseika, Aset, Kilborn, Verte, Qaedian, Ghesta, Jilaman, Raviel, Gorrgana, Selwyn, Bahck, Mellatoth, Kyleen, Tymmon, and a bunch of others to show up in Syracuse... and we get wasted at Hooters, and then at some bar in Syracuse... and then we all go back to a hotel room and get even more wasted. And then Tymmon, Jilaman, and myself almost beat the hell out of some morons at a pizza place there because they refused to sell us whole pies.... GOD DAMNED IDIOTS~~~~!! AND I KNOW I FORGOT SOMEONE WHO CAME TO THAT AND THAT I MISSPELLED SOMEONE&quot;S NAME&gt;&gt;&gt; OH MOY GOD&gt;&gt;&gt; SORRY&lt; CAPS Lokc was stuck... ack...<br>
<br>
My little guild has grown, and we have fun. I love them all, and am completely happy... except for when Dethiel and Lifey keep me up in the weeeee hours of the morning on IRC... DIE DIE DIE!!! I've got finals to take you bastards!! Have you no shame?<br>
<br>
I banned Lielani from the boards about 14 times... but his dynamic IP thingy keeps me at bay and pissed off. Please 10k IRL... dad gummit. I also banned Gundanium... felt bad about it, but he was a moron x2. Was the second time he was banned... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->         <br>
<br>
What else? wHAT ESE?? CAPS LOCK die plz... ok. Let's see... I don't know, I'm drunk, I'm happy, and I'm trying to think of what else happpened,.... and there's a LOT that happeyned. Maybe I should stop here and allow you all to pick up from what youthough was important to you or the server. THis is a piece of history mind you... so make it good.... I';d advice against doing it while druink... for obviousreasons...<br>
<br>
I'll try to adde to this later... when I'm sober.... for now I want to log on and get retarded in Sebilis or something... take care all... happy holidays, and happy new year... may the upcomming year be fun and fruitful for all. Best of wishes, from your drunken friend, Bic................................................<br>
<br>
Sierraa, plz marry me?<br>
<br>
And to all, do not switch to DAoC unless you like killing people... otherwise, EQ is the place for you and me... where we can get drunk together... YOU CANNOT EVEN GET DRUNK IN DAoC!! WTF??? Nor can you swim underwater!!?!! That's crap...<br>
<br>
Adding stuff...<br>
<br>
Bishoopugget and Meshugugget and the Nuggets of Justice have moved on to DAoC, and seem happy there... some Nuggets remain, like Lewey and Sbik, but not as much it seems... shame... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->        <br>
<br>
Toogoor and other pests seem to have left forever, or so we hope... I got an e-mail from him a few weeks back asking me to unban him, to which I referred him to Milynna and I'm sure that's why you don't see him back. She has more sense than me like that in some ways... Snyterberwhatshisface, Donkeysack, smackingmynutsonyourforhead, and tytria123 or whatever all got themselves banned for idiocy.<br>
<br>
Prices in EC have changed and change... some people still don't realize they've changed, and that prices you see on Alahkazams and other places aren't even remotely close, but we work around that. Let the clueless remain clueless I guess... the going price on an FBSS is 4k?? OMG... everyone should have one for x-mas... and Lammys is 5kish? WTF??? Who would have thought?<br>
<br>
Lets see... what else? Hrm... more to come yet...<br>
<br>
Ahhh... I know... So I run into two old guildies... Mordrok and Sejin. When we were in EoP together we always talked about getting epics someday and stuff like that... just like anyone does. And low and behold, there we are, standing together in GD, all holding our epics. Amazing... amazing... we never would have thought... wow.<br>
<br>
Moslad still keeps <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://luclin.org">Luclin.org</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> up to date and full of nice info for us to use... mad props to the FBI of Luclin. If you've never been to there, you have no idea what you're missing.<br>
<br>
What else? Oh, right. For a while there was a spree of creativity on people's sigs for the board... some beautiful, some informative, and some just god damned hilairous... I think it's safe to say that Stryke won for the most humorous, Avae had some beautiful ones, Rovell on his initial use of flash... there were many other good ones, as you all know. I always did like Bishoopugget's, and I thought that there were some other good ones in there... a lot actually. Lately however it has digressed into who can make the biggest and ugliest, but hopefully people will come around and make good quality ones again.<br>
<br>
The pinacle of the F&amp;R forum had to have been some of the matches between VH, Large, and Chakan, with Lielani, Siyni, and some others putting up good flames. Stryke was excellent but seemed to have retired at his pinacle... Ghesta vs. Hadden was a memorable flame...<br>
<br>
