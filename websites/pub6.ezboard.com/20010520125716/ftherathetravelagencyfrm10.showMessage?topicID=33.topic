<br>
Guild X has 22 peeps in raid and invite 11 guild Y members (guild X  and  guild Y BOTH post on the calendar as separate entities). The week after that guild Y invites 11 from guild X while self having 22 members. <br>
<br>
In effect, guild X and Y are both getting 33% more time then other guilds.  Can you honestly say that this is fair? Specially considering that some guilds have 70+ planable members that get to only post 1 day?<br>
<br>
If guild X  and guild Y consistently on each other's trips - they basically should post as 1 entity. </font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uaegirson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aegirson</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.nagafen.com/images/characters/aegsmall.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 11/6/00 3:54:19 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urewena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rewena</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede Master</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>12</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11/6/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>4:07:09 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://boh.thixo.net/artwork/board_art/rewena.jpg width=58 height=74></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: *Sigh*</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">He didn't say whether it was or wasn't fair =)<br>

&quot;there was never any rule stating they couldnt come from another posting entity.&quot;<br>
<br>
If he is wrong could you please post the link where this was stated =)<br>

&quot;Also as I remember that rule came into effect following an incident with a  front guild that didnt have the manpower to do a plane, never was it discussed back then that the invite couldnt be from another guild only that they couldnt be above 1/3rd.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was the infamous Edgehonor incident. Two members of edgehonor were planeable yet they booked 2 day raids. On that famous night of the incident, of 31 in the plane of fear one was EH and 30 were Clan Icewind members. I wasn't there this was from Jerrica's post after the fact.<br>
<br>
I think that the &quot;spirit of the new rules&quot; were to make sure this didn't happen again. <br>
<br>
This all goes to further support the current proposal of having more members to post but inviting whoever you want as long as you do not have more than 6 of the same gulid. It's a little more clear, and much easier to follow =) <br>
<br>
It is much more practical to check and see if 6 guests are from the same guild, than to see how many are of your own posting entity, do some math and figure out how many guests you can have =)<br>

Honnestly I dont know. I see this one a bit as a grey zone since for me, if you are 22 doing a plane alone you have more chances of geting loot then if you are 33 therefore its not as unfair as it may seem. I guess my point is if you go to 2 raid of 40 people dont you get aproximatly the same chance at loot that if you go to one raid of 20? Well its not that simple other factors get in plays  but this is where I see a bit of a grey zone. It would be unfair if the 22 people guild can't do the plane without the other guild but at the same time it would be a shame if stuff rot (which has more chances to happen the lesser you are) because you can't invite anyone else . The idea for me is to make sure whoever reserve have the number to do the planes, and I dont mean 18 people guilds because we have to realise that no guild can put 100% of their members online everytime, but at the same time have enough flexibility so that nothing rot because of rules. <br>
<br>
  However in the DBN case or any other entity posting now you can't just point them as abuser if they are following the rules that were put in place back then and still in effect (until proven otherwise). <br>
<br>
Now that being said I do think that we need to put rules into place so that a case like you mentioned (22+11) doesnt get a go in the future (mainly to reduce posting entity and encourage alliances), and I think that the way the new proposals are going, it would take care of that. I just hope we can agree on rules that decide that if an entity is reserving its because it can do the plane everytime with little problems and we won't have to do as much bean counting while they are playing, which is the part I hate. We obviously need not to put the bar too high at the same time so that the smaller guilds that are growing still get a chance to do so. Now if we could only agree on something <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   . We only have to hold a bit more then a month and we will get more places to go for loot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  <br>

Nor was it our intention to &quot;cheat&quot; the system. <br>
<br>
As far as we knew, the invites were the reserving guild's to choose. I wish that a statement to the contrary had been posted along with the original set of rules. If this had been the case, we would not have been inviting from a posting entity.<br>
<br>
We simply have some mutual friends, and invited people in an effort to eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the frequency of drops decaying. In this regard we were very successful.<br>
<br>
We have called a halt to any such further action in the future as far as our invites go.<br>
<br>
Pls note that a great number of invites came from a wide variety of guilds, or unguilded people, other than VoF. <br>
<br>
DBN supports the calendar system, hopes we can hammer out some specific rules that the rathe community can agree upon, and will gladly abide by those rules.<br>
<br>
We apologize for ruffling feathers in our misinterpretation of the &quot;spirit&quot; of the 2/3 rule. <br>
<br>
The suggested amendments to these rules, (ie; the 6 from one guild, and an upping of the minimum planeable toons required to become a posting entity), are in my opinion a step in the right direction toward eliminating &quot;grey areas&quot; on the posting rules.<br>

                                 many of us thought that the 18 min coupled with the 2/3 invites were so that one large guild could not<br>
                                 use a front (front meaning a guild no where near plane capable) to go the planes twice. If VoF and DBN<br>
                                 can both easily do a plane separately I don't see how this example hurts anyone. But that is me and I<br>
                                 could be wrong =P However I can only post what I actually thought. I think others saw it this way too.<br>
<br>
                                 Not eveyone reads these boards every day or can take the time to read every message. If you are<br>
                                 repeating yourself I'm sorry but I guess I (and apparently others too) didn't get it the first time.<br>
<br>
                                 Once again I say that the way the rules are worded, with maybe an explanation of why, is the way to<br>
                                 go from here on out. <br>
<br>
                                 Lets learn from our mistakes and move on.<br>
<br>
                                 Morty:<br>
                                 I say this sencerly I didn't think anyone would care about 2 fully plains capable guilds doing this,<br>
                                 especially when the numbers are so close and 2/3 has to be calculated. I don't remember the distinction<br>
                                 being set up of guests from posting guilds vs guests from non-posting. I don't see how this adversly<br>
                                 effects anyone. <br>
<br>
                                 I also think (again I sure could be wrong) that if someone had brought this up to Jarin and Sparki (did<br>
                                 anyone ask them before this?) that if there was a problem they would have complied with what the<br>
                                 calendar admin wanted.<br>
<br>
                                 On the guild tags, it is a comon practice for my guild to tag someone, especially on a raid to give them a<br>
                                 test run (I have a couple guildies that have to be experienced to be appreciated) and also for ease of<br>
                                 the raid. Maybe other guilds do this too. Perhaps if it was stated somewhere that this could be looked at<br>
                                 as a violation it would no longer be done, at least not on plane raids.<br>
<br>
                                 I honestly believe that most of the posting guilds will go with the rules that are agreed on given the<br>
                                 chance. Again lets get the new rules in place, with consequences and lets go forward and try it. We can<br>
                                 always go back to ffa if it all falls apart.<br>
<br>
