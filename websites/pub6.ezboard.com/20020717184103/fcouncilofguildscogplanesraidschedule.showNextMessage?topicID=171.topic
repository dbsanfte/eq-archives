I didnt actually get to sleep till Tuesday night after we retrived Daboom and Blaziin's corpse.  And then I made a few mistakes at work (I must remember to look at caldendars...) and didnt have time for much else till today.  Anyway, on with the show.<br>
<br>
I promised a recap and here it is  I got into Sro about 4:30pm PST and we began attendance at 5pm PST.  We did not have a monk puller initially, however, Blinkers from The Silent Watch volunteered to pull for us.  Due to my having to send someone else to buy the port stones after figuring out how many groups we had, the raid got off to a slightly late start.  We were porting up, however, by about 7pm PST.would like to congratulate everyone who went up.  We did not attempt a traditional CoG break in with us going up one group at a time and running for the NW camp.  Instead we attempted a portal break in where everyone ported up and we fought the wanderers down at the zone in.  This is a lot harder due to the number of wanderers as well as the fact that we then need to make a run for the NW camp and fight our way there.  That we were able to clear out the portal without significant losses was a testament to the people who came.  We also had several armor drops including some rogue legs that went to Kaman.  Althalonas was the loot master and I believe he has the loot down on another thread.  <br>
<br>
Then things went bad.  While we were able to run most of the group close to the NW camp, we apparently left several people behind.  While I was trying to figure out how to get them to us, we were attacked by a pair of Ashbone Drakes.  As Rbecka said, the raid's ability to defeat not just one, but 2, of these things at the same time was incredible.  Many raids have been wiped out just by 1.  Shortly after this, however, we were trained by a number of mobs and we were wiped out totally.  Although not before Thaime was able to camp out.  The rest of the surviving monks then proceeded to pull all the corpses to the NW wall to be rez'd.  Unfortunatly shortly after Thaime logged back in to start to rez people, the camp got trained and everyone died.  Due to missing information and general confusion organizing a CR team to head back up there took almost an hour and a half which proved to be too long.  <br>
<br>
I would like to thank Valdemiro the Vile Pirate for coming along and rez'ing Fildiar the cleric who began the rez process for most of us.  I would also like to thank Baccus, Creirwyy, Aurella, and Axemaster (I think) for braving a naked Hate run to get Valdemiro to the NW camp.  They all died in the process a second time.  here rez's continuted until we were able to get almost everyone rez'd.  Unfortunatly again, Cran and Connovar's corpses were too old to rez.  We also lost Blaziin and Daboom to LD's.  In an attempt to at least get Cran and Connovar up to recover their corpses Blinker tried to pull the corpses to the zone in, but was jumped and died.  Valdemiro once again came to our rescue to head up to Hate with us on another CR to summon Cran and Connovar's corpse and rez Blinkers.  Once again, thank to Aurella for not only porting us up there, but for making at least a half dozen trips over the night to get more hate stones.  While up there Valdemiro got aggro'd and was killed while everyone else was able to evac.  We then got the assistance of some of Blinker's friends to help us port back up there to rez Valdemiro and Blinkers and allow Cran and Connovar to loot their corpses.  In the process we got trained yet again and the CR team lost another member who we had to go up to rez again.  Finally on Tuesday afternoon Valoran was kind enough to pull the corpses of Blaziin and Daboom to the entrance and they were able to loot their corpses as well.  <br>
<br>
So in the end, no one's corpse was lost, although quite a bit of xp was.were many mistakes committed over the course of the raid, most of which were my fault for allowing.  It can be summed up by saying I rushed the whole thing with predictable results.  There was also quite a bit of inexperience there, and while that is okay since one does not gain experience by just existing, I failed to take that inexperience into account enough.  I failed at several places to excersize command judgement and overuled my own better judgement.  would like to thank those that came along for the ride.  While I was constantly being tell bombed, I never got the sort of whining that I've seen on other raids.  I would especially like to thank Creirwyy for doing her best to take on the task of helping me, as well as Kommisar. Also Eandyar for handing out treats while we waited for our CR.  And to those that helped us out with the CR, once again especially Valdemiro.  Things would have been a lot worse without your help.<br>
<br>
I've realized that at least on a KCoG raid, the puller remains one of the most important people.  He and the battle commander need to be working off the same page and not spend time arguing about strategy.  I should've overuled Blinkers on several occasions, but my attention was being shared by too many other concerns to ride herd over him.  This is not to say any of this was Blinker's fault.  His strategy would have worked with a more experienced group.  Its just that KCoG doesnt have the experience or the coordination to pull something like that off without a lot of luck.<br>
<br>
The only other thing I'd like to say is, in the future, please do not spam me.  I had 3 tells on my screen before I finished logging into Sro that night, and it never got better.  My log file was over 2.4megs and that was pure text, no battle spam at all.  Well, except for a few All Hail Inny spams we've all grown to know and love.  This isnt to say dont send me a tell if its important.  But please, do not keep asking me how things are going, or when your getting rez'd or that you need to be rez'd now because you need to go, or if you can join, etc.  I wasted at least 10-15 minutes answering those tells during our CR process, and that might've lost us the necessary time to have rez'd Connovar and Cran.  I will keep everyone inzone and your group leaders informed.  If they dont have an answer its beacuse I dont either and we're working things out.<br>
<br>
I would like to thank everyone who came.  Things didnt work out as well as I had hoped, but we did break the portal entrance and we got some loot.  Thanks again to everyone who helped with the CR and to Valoran who dragged Blaziin's corpse to the entrance.  Because of some of the problems we experienced I did withdraw KCoG from this next week's rotation.  This was mainly to allow me time to digest what happened and figure out a new plan.   Also I need to come up with several good pullers.  I dont want to put too much pressure on Zellex to have to be there for us to succeed.  With luck we should be seeing another Hate raid in the begining of August.<br>

<br>
I am glad you and I were in the same group as it did make communication go a little easier.<br>
<br>
Also, this is were I learned it is important to have both a battle commander and a raid co-ordinator.  The battle commander should be dealing with one thing and one thing only all nite, which is the battle at hand. <br>
<br>
You know the offer is there Kellory, I would be happy to assist you any time.<br>
<br>
/em applaud for taking the initiative. <p><p align="left"><img border="0" src="http://suspect27.homestead.com/files/cretag.jpg" align="left">
