<br>
Herein lies a problem.  With rotations, you have a very systematic way of keeping a mob permakilled and know when to plan for your turn – the beauty and bane of the system.  However, when mobs are kept FCFS, and some guilds (like NB for example) don’t kill flagging events back to back, so that others have a chance to get access to the content, they are “left up”, because other guilds make their plans in more of a vacuum.  They don’t know we aren’t going to do Grummus, let’s say, so they plan on doing X or Y instead, and we don’t kill Grummus because we just did, and want to avoid a back to back kill.  So this leaves us in a quandary, NB finds the loot on Behemoth specifically, very useful, and would kill him every spawn, EXCEPT that it would look like we were trying to cockblock other guilds to “keep them out of our playground”.  Guilds like LoM, SotE, and VoF, who progress on their own.  Because we don’t do this, guilds who want to team are trying to point at the “hey you left him up (to be fair to other guilds), it must mean you don’t want him so we can team him!!”  It becomes hard to tell what mobs are contested and which are not just by virtue of it being alive.  If I kill him every time he spawns, I’m a cockblocker (to guilds that have legitimate chances on their own to beat the mob), if I don’t, I “must not be interested in said mob”.<br>
<br>
I would also point back to Emil’s listing of the loot off Aerin Dar, and repeat, that just because a guild bristling with Ssra weapons and VT gear finds those to not be much of an upgrade (and in some cases not an upgrade at all), doesn’t mean that guilds who have never even seen Arch Lich, High Priest, or Creator are going to find his drops anything less than amazing.  Since we all love conspiracies so much, I picked up one of my own from Rigorre’s post.  I think, all the middle guilds are in cahoots to get flags for these three mobs, the whole time, farming the items with the excuse “hey, I’m just helping out on what I find to be a fun fight and to help get my guildies X and Y piggy-back flagged, not because I really want Item X off Aerin Dar”.  Accurate?  I dunno, but now I see the fun of these conspiracy theories.<br>

<br>
Yet no one teams on either of these mobs, why?  And again, pointing at content that was once on rotation (Yes, LTK was rotated between TL and NB for about 8 months), and is no longer because it isn't new anymore doesn't have any correlation to new content that is actively desired by 35+ guilds, their sole problem being they can't kill it solo.  If CB or VOLS could kill Aerin Dar solo, doesn't it make sense that they would?  If no one wanted Aerin Dar, this post wouldn't exist, would it?<br>

<br>
Sure, I will kill Behemoth every time he spawns, and within 24 hours, but do you promise to keep the rest of the Rathe from calling me a cockblocker who is just trying to keep people out of his xp zones?  Specifically you would need to keep Xedd/Ghalid from LoM off my back, and Coujo/Xtremely, and the GMs of FK as well, guilds that have legitimate chances at killing those mobs themselves, unaided, if he were allowed to live.  If you want to know why I would kill Behemoth so much, please check his loot table.  You have us in a Catch 22, if we don’t permakill him, then we’re just cockblocking, if we do permakill him, we’re just cockblocking.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I can think of many FFA mobs that are by for more contested then AD<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What like Vindicator?  Lodizal?  Sure, because those are mobs that many people can kill, unaided.  How many times has Lodi been agreeably teamed on (not those lovely forced alliances where everyone is trying to outdamage the other) or Vindicator?  Vindicator drops one useable item, so you aren’t going to see him teamed on very often, if at all.  Second, how do you put an 8 hour spawn like Vindicator on a rotation system that lists kills by the day, not by time of day.  Who takes graveyard shifts, since he would spawn 3 times a day?  Aerin Dar is contested, about 35+ guilds by my reckoning are looking to take him down, the problem is, only 6-8 of those guilds can do it on their own.  Three of the guilds that have killed him on their own have enough Ssra/VT gear that Aerin Dar is not worth the time to kill repeatedly (Behemoth is another story).<br>

<br>
That is because 90% of the server doesn’t play the same game that 2-5% plays.  How many L 1-45 characters do you ask on a regular basis about their feelings on the Zlandicar rotation which Far Seekers is on?  How many should you?  How many of them even know he exists or what zone he is in?  And they should have input on a mob they have only seen on a website if at all, exactly why?  Sure we all pay $12.99 a month, and if I’m on my twink, I will work with those L 1 – 45 players with the same respect about the Ghoul Lord camp as I would expect them to show me (no training, no KSing, no camp stealing, keep your camp mobs killed as they spawn, etc etc).  However, when it comes to them wanting to have input on how PoP or Ssra or VT rotations go, frankly, I don’t see why they should.  So let’s not pretend that it’s just the high end guilds looking out for their own interests, and “ignoring” the input of hundreds if not thousands of players who may very well never see the content you seem to think they should have input on.<br>

<br>
If you can’t beat Aerin Dar on your own, you cannot kill Rydda Dar on your own, and you can’t beat Mithaniel Marr on your own.  So I would have to say that no, a guild that cannot kill AD will not fair very well in third tier planes or possibly higher.  Kill a Valorian Guardian?  Sure.  Kill the loot-giving events in those planes?  No.  (Disclaimer: Using simple math of the mobs DPS in question, Rydda Dar is Aerin Dar x 2, thus if one cannot beat X, then one cannot beat 2X, with 1/2Y, where Y is the force used to beat Aerin Dar.)<br>

Yes, I really don’t give a damn what your opinion is on the issue of whether or not sharing Emperor Rifts is appropriate or not among rotation guilds.  You don’t have any, you don’t kill Emp, and your opinion on the matter, while you’re entitled to it, doesn’t mean jack or shit.  Get on rotation, ask if you can have the leftover rifts from other guilds, and when you are told a resounding no, don’t be surprised.  Just because you want to make a change, doesn’t mean it’s going to happen and for good reason.  If you’ve done the work to get there (VT), as FK has, I have no qualms about sharing.  When you ask to cut corners because you’re lazy and don’t want to do the work, I’m all out of sympathy.<br>

Who told you the RTA was a representative democracy for the whole of the Rathe?  This isn’t the US Senate where every guild gets two votes regardless of size or ability.

<br>
The double standard being an alliance at whim, and of taking two shares of loot off rotation mobs, while needing to team mobs that drop even better loot, but insisting its just “flag progression”, and its all ok because “Hey, there’s a quest”.  Then do the quest. . .last I checked the quest didn’t drop Aerin Dar items, AND it prevents further progression to further gimping of the system by guilds teaming HoH trials or Mith Marr.<br>

On a last note. All of the guilds complaining about not having a say on mobs they have not killed really dont have a leg to stand on right now. We on the Rathe have never asked the other guilds how we should set up things for mobs before as far as rotations go with mobs, why should we do so now? <br>

While, I know you said this as a mockery, you are in fact correct.  The Rathe like most things is made of many communities, that are inter-related and over-lapping.  The town where I live is a community, within that community the street I live on has a smaller community.  When I went to the local high-school I belonged to that community.<br>
<br>
What does this mean?  That just because you play on the Rathe does not mean you belong to the community that is directly effected by a paticular rotation.<br>
<br>
The rules of a rotation are decided between those in the community directly around the mob... i.e. those that are on the rotation already and have killed the mob previously.<br>

Hello, Oxy, meet Moron. You can't be 'right' and 'wrong' at the same time.

<br>
This is fine, I understand your point and find it a positive thing that you have chosen to do this.  However, you (as in those who have killed these mobs) need to determine a way of demarkating who is up and who has killed last.  A mob that has been up for several days is just begging to be ganked by somebody, and I suspect that despite this discussion, CB/VoLS will not be the last to assume that nobody is interested in a mob that has spent half a week unclaimed.  I suggest that you put your heads together and determine a suitable method of removing this mob from FCFS status.  It will likely not be long before complete pick-up raids start forming with people of those 35+ guilds you mentioned to take him and other PoP bosses down.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I would also point back to Emil’s listing of the loot off Aerin Dar, and repeat, that just because a guild bristling with Ssra weapons and VT gear finds those to not be much of an upgrade (and in some cases not an upgrade at all), doesn’t mean that guilds who have never even seen Arch Lich, High Priest, or Creator are going to find his drops anything less than amazing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This may be true, but you will agree that we could care less about what the drops were when compared to the value of another place to gain decent xp (and the spectrals that I am having a hard time buying from large guild mules for 10 to 50K).  With 2 guilds working toward killing AD, the division of one weapon each did very little to improve the overall of dps potential of our guilds.  And the 4 ethereal parchments that dropped were a wonderful joke.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yet no one teams on either of these mobs, why?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Speaking for CB, we don't team them because we can do either without aid.  As for other guilds, I cannot guess<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And again, pointing at content that was once on rotation (Yes, LTK was rotated between TL and NB for about 8 months), and is no longer because it isn't new anymore doesn't have any correlation to new content that is actively desired by 35+ guilds, their sole problem being they can't kill it solo.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sorry, I was unaware that LTK was rotated.  Regardless, you will agree that it is a better example than Trakanon that people keep mentioning.  And the new aspect of PoP that you brought up is not really relevant, is it?  Although ST is three expansions old (ignoring its update), all but two of the 35+ guilds mentioned in your post are still interested in drops from there and only one guild has backed out of all rotations that provide keys for that zone.<br>
<br>
Having strayed a bit off topic, I can see how everyone gets sucked into FC here, something I do my best to avoid. LOL<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to the topic at hand . . . something explicitly agreed upon regarding these flag mobs needs to be hammered out.  Obviously I would favor seeing something that allowed teaming, so we could get the rest of our guild flagged, but anything concrete at this point would be a positive development.  Pointing to several flame threads in various places on the RTA would likely be insufficient evidence of a hard and fast rule.   <p>Gatori Vonhinx<br>

<br>
How are our current standards not fair?<br>
Why would we change our existing rules?<br>
Our systems has worked for years there is no reason to change it now.<br>
A non rotation mob is and has been fcfs. <br>
Refer to my previous post that was ignored.<br>
Everyone making these huge post over a simple matter to meat there own ends.<br>
<br>
Mob X is FCFS so whoever gets to it first and kills has every right to it. This can be a pickup group such as many raids on old world dragons.<br>
Why is a mob put on a rotation?<br>
Because it is highly contested mob and everyone deserves a fair shot at it.<br>
Here we have  mob X that stays up for several days at a time.<br>
By our rules it does not require Rotation, but should be FCFS under our server rules.<br>
To put this mob on a rotation is to create the very double standard your talking about Thundax.<br>
<br>
Say u do put mob x and other's on a rotation.  If u do this it will require guilds dedicated to kill mob x within 24 hrs. of it's spawn time.  Otherwise this is wasting loot for our server.  <br>
These mobs are no different then other FCFS mob and shouldn't require speacial rules. Just because 1 guild did it on there own and other worked with another guild so what. This is allowed on not contested/not rotation mobs and I am yet to see a good reson for changing this<br>

How many other FCFS mobs does CB team up with other guilds to kill that they could not kill on thier own?<br>
<br>
If your answer is near to or equal to zero, then why was an exception made in this case?<br>
<br>
Because these mobs give you a flag that grants you access to a new zone.

<br>
No, because I can get an ST key from any of now 7-9 sources (Vindi has it rarely as does Velk, KT/Statue, and the original five dragons).  With Trakanon, he is the only source of Trak teeth for a VP key.  There is a quest around Aerin Dar, but it does not allow further progression in PoP, and drops no loot.  PoP is very relevant to the conversation and comparison.  You are talking about two very different flags - one that allows xp in a new zone, for now six people, and one that allows progression to Mith Marr and beyond.<br>
<br>
I also understand that CB hasn't yet successfully killed Sontalak as per my last conversation with Rogg, if you have since then, congratulations.  However, assuming my information is correct, why aren't you teaming on Sontalak?  I believe the answer to be that it is because he only drops one key, and that is why you don't see two or more guilds teaming him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sladenpaladian>SladenPaladian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Representin' in diz HIZHOUSE!</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(4/10/03 3:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=193>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Response to Teamwork thread in guild rep forum.  </span><hr size=1> Sont dead sunday, Karadin, but I see the point you're making.

The double standard being an alliance at whim, and of taking two shares of loot off rotation mobs, while needing to team mobs that drop even better loot, but insisting its just “flag progression”, and its all ok because “Hey, there’s a quest”.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Lets look for a single second what it would mean ...seriously... to rotate Aerin'Dar (a rotation to preserve order and provide scheduling) while exempting that rotation from the 'no team' rule.  What does that really mean?  It means that 2 guilds of 30-40 people can team up as an alliance (as one entity) for that one mob rotation, while your 1 guild of 72 people can be placed on the same rotation ...essentially now getting twice the amount of BETTER LOOT, by your own admission, because there is only one of you and two of them.  They have to either divide the loot equally among the two, or alternate loot on each cycle.  Either way, each guild in that alliance is getting half of what your one guild is getting.  THAT is the price they pay to be an alliance on that one particular mob.<br>
<br>
So, in the big picture, yes ..they are doubling up on one mob (getting half the loot from that mob ...loot that you say is BETTER than loot from mobs currently on rotation) and still maintaining their individual guild rotations in the old world (1 to 1 ratio compared to you on loot that you say is CRAP compared to what can be found in PoP).  Comparing them any other way is wrong ...in this case, you can't look at the 'big' picture and extrapolate comparisons from it.  That's like saying there should be two attempts per rotation cycle on Mob #1 because his loot is about half as equivalent than Mob #2 who you only get 1 attempt at each cycle.<br>

If you don't have anything constructive or intelligent to add, then STFU!!!  You are only showing your ignorance and stupidity!! And being from Noble Blade, I expected a little more class, guess I was wrong.<br>

AD is not contested, simple fact. The only people that post here trying to argue on why it should fall under rotation rules are NB, BOTs, and TL.  (Sorry if I missed anyone).

If your answer is near to or equal to zero, then why was an exception made in this case?&quot;<br>
<br>
This is new content I remember Bots and other teaming up for first vox kill at 1 point and I know noble blade has teamed up at 1 time or anther on other mobs.  In fact Noble Blade formed from 2 seperate guilds at 1 point.<br>
<br>
Reason we don't team other mobs?  Well only mobs i think that we couldn't kill are on Rotations thus not allowed and we will abide by these rules.  And if there was a rotation needed on AD then we the same would be true.  <br>
<br>
IF Bohemouth has this ubber loot and everyone wants a piece of him put him on a Rot like other mobs. If someone knows he's goning to spawn they can ask for a shot at him like we do on ALL other rotations or race for him. Or is there only 1 guild wanting his loot?.  Again if this is so it's not hard to send your guild a tell and say hey we would like a shot at mob X when he spawns. <br>
<br>
This is how everything currently works and works well.<br>
Rather a mob flags u or not should not any affect as to rather it's a rotation mob or not. The only thing that matters is rather or not the mob is highly contested.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah we killed Sont as Sladin posted. <p>Tammasoul<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Congratulations on Sontalak.  And I hate to have to say this, but in threads like this it seems I must, but seriously, Congratulations.  Sont’s a bitz of a dragon, and something to be proud of stomping on your own like that.<br>

<br>
Rigorre,<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I particularly enjoy your method of quoting half-sentences and removing all context.  People may groan about the length of my posts, but at least I keep the context of what I quote.<br>
<br>
I don’t enjoy you putting words in my mouth:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> So, in the big picture, yes ..they are doubling up on one mob (getting half the loot from that mob ...loot that you say is BETTER than loot from mobs currently on rotation)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have said, several times, that the loot is as good as VT/Ssra gear, and for guilds not on those rotations to claim Aerin Dar A) doesn’t drop items, or B) those items are subpar, is completely inaccurate.  I’ve already gone out on a limb, and with a fair amount of confidence of being right, that regardless of what items dropped from Aerin Dar that day to CB/VOLS, those two items are among the best those two guilds have seen.  Quite simply, dismissing the quality of his loot as non-existent or subpar is not being accurate.<br>
<br>
Your idea of those mobs being on rotation AND allowing teaming is a step back not forward.  You fail to account for the fact that yes, while they “suffer” by only getting one item each from a mob they normally couldn’t touch on their own, they are getting double the loot every other guild gets on *every* rotation mob they are currently on.  Let’s look at that again, in case you missed it – net gain: 1 item each they can’t get on their own, and one full complete set of loot from all other rotations they are on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> And, once again, you are on the wrong track. Having it handed on a 'silver platter' implies that you will get the flag using your resources and your l33t skills ... and hand it over to me.

<br>
No, you are demanding my restraint, and I agree it makes sense to show that restraint, but within reason.  I don’t permakill Behemoth so that other guilds can get access to content that isn’t fomally rotated, but because of that restraint, other guilds take advantage of its status of being “up” as a sign no one is interested in it.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Who told you it wasn't?!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So which of this week’s brand new players did you personally set out to make sure they had their input reflected on what goes on here?  Your “registering to vote” if you will.  Since not every player on the Rathe has input on what goes on here, and I mean, *every* player (that guy you watched walk out of the store and who logged onto the Rathe yesterday, yah, him too), that makes it not a representative democracy of the Rathe.  So be careful which way you wave that elitist paintbrush, because we have all agreed to this system for the last three years, and where exactly you fall in that is only determined by what mobs you’ve killed, unassisted.  Haven’t killed Rallos Zek?  Guess what, you don’t get to say one meaningful word about what goes on in running it.  Want input?  Kill him and get on it, then see if you can convince the others that your idea is better.  It’s not a perfect system, but it sure is better than what people on other servers have to put up with.  <br>
<br>
The rotation system was setup to organize sharing between guilds that could kill certain content.  It makes no sense to share with someone who can’t kill said content.  Think I’m the only one who realizes this?  Last time you killed DesireableBigMob X, did you ask the other 3 people in the zone if they wanted to take their fair shot at the mob?  If you didn’t, why not?  Aren’t we all about sharing and complete altruism?  Isn’t that the high horse your riding on?  <br>
<br>
So to answer your question, yes, those guilds who killed it first get to set the precedents on the server – that is how this game has evolved on all levels.  Where and how do you think various zone conventions came from?  Why are the Arch Magi and Ghoul Lord separate camps on our server?  Why does the Frenzied Ghoul get the Sentinel as well?  From the first people into the zone making up common sense, fair rules that make sense.  Trying to claim King and Lord at the same time is impractical (back when the level cap was L 50 and King was a 2 group camp).  If you look beyond your own drive for “new phat xp zones”, you’d see that these are fair rules we’ve played by for the last three years.  Inflating your numbers for one encounter, while rotating other content as separate entities just isn’t fair to the rest of the people who remain separate entities for all content and play within the means their guild’s abilities and skills can provide for them.<br>
<br>

<br>
Who made those RTA rotation rules you list as the Constitution?  Were you even playing?  If you were, was it in a capacity that had anything to do with the high end game on the Rathe?  If you weren’t, you honestly think it was our responsibility to go to each of 5-10,000 players who log on at various times of day playing from all around the world and make sure to ask each and every one what their vote was on matters that they had absolutely no understanding of?  No, it wasn’t, and in such a free form society as EQ is, that is not how you make order out of chaos.  You create a system that the strong will buy into, or else the system won’t work.  Fortunately, our system dealt with how people would later be added to the “exclusivity” of the rotations, so that it had buy in from the smaller guilds knowing that diligence and effort would pay off and if they followed the rules and conventions of the system, that it would pay off.  It’s a delicate balance, but make no bones about it, it’s not a democracy based on making sure everyone gets unlimited guaranteed chances at whatever content they might desire, nor on people giving input into rotations they aren’t participants on.  I’m not going out of my way to wait on United Necros to get enough keys to kill Emp before I kill him again, nor is FK nor is SoTE.  When they get the keys, and can kill Blood, then they can take their shot, having shown they at least understand what is required to win.  Once they are on rotation, they can give ideas on how to better run the rotation, but as its fairly simple and very effective at sharing content between those who can kill, it’s hard to improve on.<br>
<br>
As for you referencing the EULA and PnP policies, be careful, there is a LOT of leeway on what can be done there that doesn’t violate those.  And even violating those, doesn’t seem to carry as harsh a sentence as you might hope (sadly).<br>

<br>
Noble Blade and Spirit of Tunare teamed up on one Avatar of War, one hour before server was coming down, AFTER both of us had already killed it ourselves, several times each.  This was done to prevent loot from being eaten by the patch, and it was made very clear that if BOTS or Tindi wanted Avatar of War, he was all theirs.  You kill Aerin Dar on your own, even once, and I don’t care who you bring to your raid.  Chances are if you could kill Aerin Dar alone, you wouldn’t begin wholesale flagging of people from 35 other guilds.<br>
<br>
As for us forming from two guilds, yes, we were Noble House and Silver Blade.  We were one entity for all rotations and reservations.  We are now one guild, and have been since Dec 5, 2000.  We are still one entity for all rotations.  I practice what I preach.<br>

<br>
The unwritten, backdoor room conventions made up by the big guilds and the smoking man, is that you don’t back to back kill FCFS mobs, especially PoP mobs so that we can all get what we need.  Its made easier by the fact that if a guild has extra flags they don’t need, you can send along a few to get them taken care of.  It’s a really nice system when you’re done with needing flags and another guild has a recently player return from retirement because they hit new content they want to check out.  And as for that tell, you can’t begin to understand how amazingly difficult it is for other guilds to do that.  I guess it’s pride, I dunno, but recently I had a member of a guild try and work out a shot on a rotation mob and that member got chewed out for being civil and asking.<br>

I see SOTE, LoM, and VOF against teaming as well.  Thus far, everyone who has killed Aerin Dar on their own is on one side of the argument, and everyone who has teamed or wants to team, is on the other side.  What does that tell you?<br>

Because old “FCFS” mobs, especially ones that provide keys to new zones keep getting brought up.  Velious and other mobs don’t have anything to do with it, except that they are where our historical precedents come from.<br>
