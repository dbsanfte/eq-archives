There were spawns up when we went through, which was of course a factor (aside from Rixma being in Chardok) in my decision to keep going and take East Wing, which they were not IN.<br>
<br>
2) Yes, you flamed us from the moment you got in zone. We did not flame back. I told LOM to not retaliate. You're entirely correct, there are no prizes for belittling people over /ooc, which is why I'm glad that my group didn't. Sttarrain did profess a love for lima beans though. I suppose that hurt your feelings?<br>
<br>
3) I said I would take the blame because I am responsible for taking a camp that was not camped, but called. There's a little rudeness in it but it's the same as a salesman giving your toaster oven that you said you'd come back later that day for to the first buyer who actually shows up with the money in his hand. You aren't entitled to what you don't work for.<br>
<br>
4) I don't regret my actions, I am sorry people's feelings <br>
were hurt. There's a difference. If I didn't think that it is human nature to flare up over petty spats like this and forget them a week later, I might feel guilty. You had 3 people claim a camp, one zone out and two sit around doing nothing to hold that camp for an hour. I took the camp. I'm sorry that your feelings are hurt. I don't feel guilty for taking an untouched camp.<br>

The fact that they had respawned by the time you had already GOT to East (since you made up your mind to run there when you got in the zone) didn't appear to matter to you because you rode through anyway.  You had an agenda and took nothing else into consideration but YOU, and brought LoM people with you - they heard the ooc's just as you did, and could have made decisions to help you with your kill of Drusella (who wasn't even up) or to say, &quot;Look - camp taken - let's do something else.&quot; <br>
<br>
And again, if my group - who was assembled at East wing in full after you guys rode through - had decided to go to Drusella's spawn point, there is nothing illegal about that either.  We could have all sat there for 3 days fighting for the mobs at Drusella's spawn point and whoever gets agro first gets her.  Nothing illegal was done (according to Verant) but that doesn't make what you did in the best interest of other players in Norrath.  What you did you did for YOU - you had no thought processes here except selfish intentions for yourself.  It makes a statement to your credibility and honor as a player.  <br>
<br>
We called the camp first and had started pulls.  You should have respected the camp call.  There are OTHER people out there that have been waiting for drusella for 3 months or longer too but that doesn't seem to enter your mind.  The fact that East Wing had respawned by the time you got there doesn't mean Vort and Sulp were not pulling from there.  If I had known this would have turned into this, I never would have left the zone, but I have a feeling you would have just run over us anyway because so far you have shown absolutely no consideration for other people in this whole mess - it has all been about you and YOUR loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udontetossalad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Donte Tossalad</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tvdance.com/baseketball/6a.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(9/28/02 2:13:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=746.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Humanit</span><hr size=1> how did east repop in the 5-10 minutes you said it took for us to get there? <p><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/zeiramxx/sweetsweetsig.jpg>

<br>
Do I feel pride in stepping past a single guy with his twoboxed druid who was huddling around waiting for reinforcements before actually entering east wing? No, but neither do I feel shame, I just feel sorry for Clan X. I've been there before. But if you work hard enough, you'll move up in the world. We busted our asses (didn't use the lev trick) and got to an UNCAMPED area before the people who had called it a full hour ago did. I can't not feel a sense of pride in our performance, but it doesn't keep me from feeling sorry for Rix &amp; Clan X either. <br>

Re-read posts.  Regardless of where I was, my group had taken camp and pulled spawns from that camp.  Regardless if 2 people or 6 people were there, they had enough to claim that camp because they were pulling spawns from there.  Doesn't matter where I was.  Camp was actively being pulled.  People leave camps all the time and come back, but their group members continue to pull while they are gone.  If the camp is actively being engaged it should not matter how many people are there. <p><a href="http://www.eqclanx.com/" target="_blank">

<br>
I asked the question as until now you had not answered that point.  I was curious as to weather or not that was indeed correct, or an untrue statement.<br>
<br>
I have yet to voice an opinion as to what &quot;I&quot; think on this situation.  <br>
<br>
I was merely looking for a clarification of facts.<br>
<br>
Thanks for clearing up where you were.<br>

The legal rules according to Verant way ... or the way the post was inteded which is the human way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Getting the legal way out our systems.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Does Verant recognize camps?  No.<br>
Would we have been violating Verant rules if both LoM and Clan X sat at Drusella spawn and fought over this for days till she spawned?  No.<br>
Is there a number requirement per group for claiming a camp?  No.<br>
Do you have to pull a certain number of spawns to claim a camp?  Not according to Verant.  But at least one would be nice, right?<br>
<br>
Okay, any Verant rules I missed?  Please enlighten me if I did.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Now, what about basic understood and somewhat agreed upon rules of The Rathe and the Play Nice philosophy I thought most played by.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
How do you establish camps?  First, by calling them out in ooc.  Second, by you yourself being the first to engage mobs in one of the camps.  Had our &quot;group&quot; (regardless of size) done both of these things?  Yes. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
If people are grouped in Library in sebilis and they run out of mobs, do they run into disco, see that a group is in there but they have mobs spawned, and just decide to take their camp because they can?  Or do they ask questions like, &quot;You guys okay?  Are you leaving?  Can we take some spawns of yours?  There is a named up, can we have it?  You guys are short people it looks like, can you handle this camp or are you leaving soon?&quot;<br>
<br>
What would happen if Library group just started pulling Disco mobs, perhaps even named, and not talk to Disco group?  Would there be problems?  Or would Disco group simply let them do that?<br>
<br>
What if they are medding?  What if they are CoHing people from the zone in?  What if someone left the zone to get spells because they just dinged and they want to mem them to help the group?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Do other camps interrogate Disco because they are sitting there for 15 minutes not pulling?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Or do people actually talk to each other and respect that they are there in the camp?<br>
<br>
This is my last post on this subject because I am moving past this.  I made the initial post because I am angry that working this out in the spirit of teamwork was never considered.  And for Ssarvhok that doesn't seem to have changed, my post didn't make a dent.  I guess I expected people to care about how they move through Norrath as PEOPLE and how they affect the human experience of the game.  I will never adopt Ssarvhok's way of establishing a camp because the way he treated us is why so many people leave EQ, and I will not authorize my guild to do so either.  People leave the game because of issues just like this.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry if I inferred that LoM is to blame here.  I don't consider the guild as a whole to share Ssarvhok's attitude, but I also don't think the leadership got involved as much as they should have in this particular issue.  Xedd made a call and I respect that, I just don't agree with his final decision.<br>
<br>
What Ssarvhok did is perfectly legal in the eyes of Verant.  It doesn't make it right. <p><a href="http://www.eqclanx.com/" target="_blank">

It all comes down to the initial questions brought up in the first post, essentially, where was the common courtesy? So what if they were sitting there for 45 minutes waiting on someone? It happens. The decent thing to do is say, &quot;ok&quot;, pack up, and move on to the MANY other exp spots available in the game today. There is no excuse to impinge on camps, and that includes people in the process of getting to or starting a camp. The d!ckhead thing to do is taking the first opportunity to take the camp away from someone else that was there first, regardless of whether or not they had begun to clear the spawn cycle.<br>
<br>
You LoM guys said it yourself, you went in there, saw they were there, heard them call the east wing, and said to yourselves, &quot;if we get there first its ours&quot;, and proceeded to do exactly that. Jackasses KSing or spamming zones or training and such are relatively easily dealt with, they piss you off but they don't end up impacting your overall experience in the game. Jackasses that lack basic courtesy and take any opportunity to stomp over other individuals, especially in the level 60+ game, ruin the gaming experience for everyone around them.<br>
<br>
Were VI rules broken? Nope. Were they within their &quot;rights&quot; as dictated in the general sense by our server? Most, when you come right down to it, will say yes. Were they being d!ckheads? You betcha. So what if they screamed at you in /ooc, I would have too if someone was acting in that manner to me and my friends. Many people will now think twice about sharing or respecting called camps from the people involved in the future though. Respect and a$$holery are the karma of eq, they both come back at your three times what you put into it from others.<br>

No, Rixma, your monk and his twobox druid had not actually entered the East Wing. I can throw a SOE on and use the lev trick to get up to the entrance and kill those 9 spawns, but that is an ENTIRELY different than actually going INTO the East Wing. Thus me saying I took an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> untouched camp</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. As I said before, had I found Clan X actually INSIDE the East Wing, I would have respected them calling it an hour before. Since they called it and never made good on it, it was still wide open. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to beat about the bush, I was after Drusella, so were you. Drusella is not a camp, she's a race mob, whoever gets into the wing and in position first. We both knew she would spawn sometime in the next hour if the systemwide message about server repops was true. You called East Wing (We called Drusella first, since we typed it faster does that give us priority?) and then you LEFT, and your guild group NEVER ENTERED THE WING. *shrug* We got there, waited an hour to see if she'd spawn, and left the camp when she didn't. Sorry your feelings were hurt.<br>
