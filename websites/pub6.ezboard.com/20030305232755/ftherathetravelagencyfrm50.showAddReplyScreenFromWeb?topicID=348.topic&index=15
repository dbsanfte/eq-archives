The original BoTS was disbanded for &quot;training&quot; the guild Bloodline of the Bear in fear. If I remember right, BloB cleared the plane except for Cazic, and BoTS was called in to kill him. BloB hadn't left the plane when BoTS zoned in, and some BoTS members got aggro. I think their camp spot was the same as BloB's, and of course all the mobs trained in and wiped everyone. Petitions were made, and it all came down to one GM disbanding BoTS. I was there and personally thought it was a stupid decision. <p>Sage Mordicai Nar`Zhul<br>

<br>
I was also in Fear at the time BotS was disbanded. We were at the north wall safe spot area slowly pulling mobs with around 20 people. At that time it was a fairly small number for a Fear raid, so we could only handle a couple of mobs at a time.<br>
<br>
BotS zoned in and was meant to do a West Wall breakin, but somehow, some members ended up training us at our camp. I don't really think that BotS should have been disbanded, as it really seemed to be a knee jerk reaction. Anyway, it happened, but really has had no lasting effect on them except for being Blood rather than Brotherhood.<br>
<br>
I think the real reason of reforming as Blood rather than Brotherhood is because the SLR's didn't like being part of a brotherhood.<br>

In the begining, the two guilds that went at it were Knights of Eternal Good and Brotherhood of the Spider. At the time, KEG was probably the stronger, especially during the time of the Triad (the alliance between MFH, KEG, and CIW). Bots formed it's own alliance with Knights of the Iron Cross and another guild which name escapes me, but that alliance was not long lived either.<br>
<br>
The planes opened up and suddenly, there was more than two places to raid  . It was the conflicts that existed between guilds for the vital plane of fear resources that spawned the calander. At the time, the calander was just a forum set up by...I frankly forget. I believe it was a paladin in Champions of Norrath at the time. It was a courtesy system where people would post their intention to raid a plane, however it was turned into a reservation system. <br>
<br>
By Kunark, the tide was changing. BoTS was the first to kill Trakanon, and was able to get themselves the vital level 60 spells first by farming Juggs and protectors. KEG was the first to down Venril Sathir, and were the only guild who could do it for quite a while. KEG would whipe on Trak though a few times till they nailed it, and BoTS never seemed to be in that big of a rush to kill Venril (probably because they discovered the quest to Veshaan's Peek and were working on gearing up for it.) BoTS was into VP first, with KEG following not too far behind. It was during this era that BoTS really took command of the title of #1 guild on the server, but they still had stiff competition.<br>
<br>
KEG played catch up, and was still pretty close in terms of ability. BoTS however was now probably the stronger guild, if only by a small margin. Then there was alot of down time between expansions, and eventually people took breaks and retired as there was nothing much left to kill. Until velious...<br>
<br>
Velious saw guilds spread out alot more, giving the tier 2 guilds alot more chances to raid, albiet old content. KEG was picking up members, determined to catch up to BoTS. Still, there were alot of tier 2 guilds out there at the time that content was still being raced two. This was the expansion that saw mobs with over 32k of hit points, and the birth of the 10 minute fight  . KEG was coming on strong, but was still behind in the race for the new key to uber loot dungeon_03 (aka Sleepers Tomb). During this era, it was announced that the Rathe and Eci were to be split. <br>
<br>
MFH was torn asunder because of this, as many of their raid oriented people wanted the chance to excel on a new server, and get the chance to stretch out from the crowding on this server. <br>
<br>
KEG left this server very strong, and was the top guild on Zeb until internal conflict ripped it apart. The core of KEG still lives on as Final Sanctuary, and they have gone back to the smaller more decidated playerbase that was their trademark. Nowadays, some ex-KEG people can be found among the members of Crusaders of Pililo (also left this server during the split).<br>
<br>
CIW disbanded not too long after Stormhammer was created. Several members of Clan icewind left Zebuxoruk to join Snaggle in his own guild (Snaggle was an ex-KEG warrior, and one of the best stradegists to play on this server). <br>
<br>
As for me?  I am an old name probably long forgotten except by the very old players on this server.  I was around much of the conflict at the time, as I was an Admin here.  I am also a historian so to speak, and I have taken great joy in watching the evolution of a community over the period of several years. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=309481">Manas Pineblade</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Now what i have been wondering is WTH is with all the United Necros jokes.  We had maybe 20 members when i was there and i was instructed to zerg invite peeps and only necros and it was a really fun guild for all of the 4 lvls i was in it.<br>
<br>
So can you all tell me the reason they get made fun of. <p>&lt;br&gt;Dastante Soulsaver &lt;br&gt;60 High Priest<br>

Blades of Destiny (BotS s3kr3t guild after disbandment) was the first guild to clear VP.<br>

Special note needs to be given to Majdar's "CHARGE!" shout in Sebillis on KEG's Trak raid, which was followed by a group of KEG "friends" being slaughtered as they rushed in.  Also, my killing of Valindor, frequent owning of Falconus, and the great KEG/BotS flame wars of old. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tils>Tils</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.loopi.co.uk/bounce.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/2/02 4:40:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=348.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.loopi.co.uk/tils2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need some info on Rathe history</span><hr size=1> filled in the my memory alot thanks Manas ....btw wheres your ugly avatar!<br>

Lots of name calling insued but in the end Bloodline of the Bear tried to hog the spotlight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

But damnit I was there too!, and I wasn't GL of LoM at the time either. LoM has a long history too of which I will not type out because I am lazy.<br>
