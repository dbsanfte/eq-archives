There is absolutely no way you can prevent the presence of other players in the zone you raiding, unless the programming prevents it.<br>

Asking people to leave when doing high-end raids usually works on the rathe. But there will always be chance of someone camped in the zone, logging in, or someone who just got flagged for it, who had to go see it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=o8ithefitzi8o>O8I The Fitz I8O</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/2/03 9:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Regarding Scripted Events and the like...</span><hr size=1> From Nyca's post:<br>

It is uncommon to see people in PoNb becuase it is not an LFG zone.  However, PoNb is good exp and is a source for a highly desired tradeskill component.<br>

I've been in an exp group during a TT raid.  We succored to the zone in and stayed there during the course of the raid.  I think this is adequate since the distance between zone in and the TT dome is large enough that a group getting exp at the zone in won't interfere with the TT event. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grulnick>Grulnick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User and Abuser!</span><br>  Posts: 744<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/2/03 9:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re</span><hr size=1> Vyxn, who are you again?

You keep thinking that Grulnick.  I'm sure those people on the other servers where they have to remove people from zones due to conflicts that arise have thought the same thing. <p><table align="left">

I know none of those events need people to leave, that was my point.  I created a list of scripted event that should <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> require people to leave the zone.  In this way, I suggested that Rogg use specific events in his post to the etiquette section.<br>
<br>
Why would I do this?  Simple.  If you aren't ridiculously specific with things like this, you will see people using examples such as the ones I mentioned to argue against clearing Tactics in the future.  Can you not see their arguments already?  &quot;We didn't have to leave the zone for X event, why should we have to leave the zone for the RZ event?&quot;  As I am fairly sure you and I are both strongly in favor of not having people blowing scripted events currently or in the future, I am unsure why you called me out with a line-by-line reply rejecting my post. <p>Gatori Vonhinx<br>

In my first post I neglected the mobs you posted and was simply expanding upon what I had already posted.  It was nothing more than clarification, and I apologise if it came off as a flame to you, it was not intended.  I guess I was taking your specifics and being more specific.<br>

First off, I like to exp in tactics and I have no problem what so ever clearing out when someone comes to kill RZtW.<br>
<br>
BUT, this week NB has been doing the RZtW script during prime time playing hours pretty much the whole week.  45 minutes? nope =/<br>
<br>
Like I said, I have no problem clearing out, but maybe something along the lines of &quot;no rztw attempts on consecutive days&quot; might be in order?<br>
<br>
Once, of course, NB puts him on farm status this will be a moot point to them, they will breeze in and out and no one will care.  But, right now its been a frustrating week trying to be civil and asking and finding out that tactics is yet again off limits. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=183108"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.cox.net/aianya/Stead1.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zahrimxealdabooboos>Zahrim Xealdabooboos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/7/03 2:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> This scripting is very time intensive and difficult.  It took Tindi 9 days i think it was to drop their first RZ, we are at 7 or 8 so far, i have no idea how many days bots threw themselves into the fray.  It is just a bit more obvious to the general populace of the rathe because more guilds have dropped Behiomith (sp) since tindi dropped RZ and before we put ourselves in that position.  I fully expect to FK, and any other guild at that stage of flag progression, when they begin their RZ attempts to go through the same pain we are learning the script and tatics.  Everything MUST happen a certin way or it fubars and ya wipe and CR and start again.  Once we learn the script, it'll take considerably less time to do him, but it is not easy and guilds still wipe out to it.  <br>
<br>
In turn your guild and any other guild who is learning the scripting will be given the same curtosy you have extended to us durning our learning experience here.  <br>

The other 1% were afk and then when they got back immediately left and again most of the time i got an apology. <br>
<br>
The RZ event is a very time intensive and hard event. To lose the event due to someone that might not want to leave the zone would be just stupid. You might say well im just at zone in i cant hurt the raid, but as spoken by NB, yes you can. You might just piss off one of the mobs somehow due to verants lovely coding and screw up a raid by doing that.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of exp zones out there. Asking people to leave while a guild is trying to do RZ, even if it is for a week or more solid is not that bad. Think about it as they will extend the same courtesy to you one day when you are in the same boat. <br>
<br>
On that note i'll add this. If you ever see a BotS member ignoring requests to leave during an RZ attempt or whatnot just send an officer a tell and we will fix it for you. I dont see this happening as we know we had to ask many to leave when we have done it but if it ever does feel free to shoot me a tell<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And on the post of well NB has been there however many days and you want to exp there. Sorry but that encounter isnt a you go one time and just kill RZ. Its a learning process just like any of the high end mobs. I forget how many tries we had to take at him before we won, but fortunately for us there werent many that were flagged for the zone at the time and I didnt have to ask too many to leave every time. Just be courteous is all we are asking and go exp somewhere else for a couple hours and one day it will pay off for you as well.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soneya>Soneya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/7/03 6:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

By your own admission it would be justified in forcibly removing you from the zone.<br>
<br>
How about working with those trying to get past these events with some sort of sense of respect.  I would argue that the normal playability of Potac is strictly a raiding zone.  The are oppotunities to xp, but at it's heart, the zone was designed for the Zek story line and scripts.  Disagree?  Guess what happens when you spawn RZTW?  All the mobs in the pit despawn, thereby eliminating the best xp spots.<br>
<br>
It's unfortunate some people will be put out by guilds trying to get past RZ script, however there are other places you can go xp, there are not other places they can go to defeat the script.  Guilds wanting to progress past this are a reality.  When they trigger RZTW more than likely your great xp spot is going to poof and get you killed anyways, so why not avoid the whole issue from the get go?<br>

I hear Corinav is a 80 mob add during the fight.  What happens when the &quot;boss mob of PoFire&quot;, fuck if i know who it is, is engaged.  Pretty obvious that PoTime is a one guild at a time place full of 3 group events.<br>

PoW is very laggy.  <br>
<br>
PoFire Boss Fennin Ro Event is pretty much contained in one area also.  TL and BotS have both been in the zone and the event did not seem to be affected.<br>
<br>
The only problem with Coirnav and FR is that they are &quot;triggered&quot;.  If someone inadvertantly blows the trigger, it takes 3 to 4 days to reset.<br>
<br>
PoAir Boss Xegony is past a keyed barrier.  TL was in PoA doing avatars while BotS was doing the Xeg event, and there didn't seem to be any appreciable lag.<br>
<br>
Yes, PoTime is a one guild at a time (hehe) zone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zahrimxealdabooboos>Zahrim Xealdabooboos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Toade, remember them?</span><br>  Posts: 256<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(6/9/03 7:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Regarding Scripted Events and the like...</span><hr size=1> Thanks Nyca that helps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When you post up yer stickey, on &quot;triggered&quot; events (Zek, Natox, HoH trials, etc), post the mobs names that are the triggers so we know who they are and we do not inadvertantly pull and kill them.  You did with Natox for the cleric epic, he is simply the trigger to spawn Ixblat Fir.  Be good to have HoH trigger dudes names the Diecon's (sp) for RZ and so on and so forth.  It will leave less room for people to 'claim' &quot;i had no idea&quot;.. especially posting entity guilds, and any guild that is beyond AD is a posting entity here and will have access to this info <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
