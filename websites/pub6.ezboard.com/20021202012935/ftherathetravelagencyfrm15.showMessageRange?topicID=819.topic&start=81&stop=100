I said your guild flamed us for mob whoreing.  I did not say they used childish language, expletives, etc...  As nilasu's log notes, they flamed our kill.

So basically what you are saying is, now let me get this straight...<br>

<br>
Who came here that wasn't on SoY's side? It's nice that Trolo feels he should defend his brothers guild, and I respect the brothers keeper routine you are doing too, but there are TWO possible theories here. <br>
<br>
1. The logs are false, and Trolo is telling the truth, along with all the Yama's. <br>
<br>
2. The logs are real, and trolo is either lying or misinformed (though I suspect at least a little willfully misinformed.<br>
<br>
The two are mutually exclusive: <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
I am not saying they are fake or edited, but how can you call him a liar?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'll admit, Trolo could be just grossly misinformed, maybe by word of mouth, or what he wants to believe, or whatever. He could be telling what he thinks the truth is. He's wrong, but that's neither here nor there. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Fuck that. How can you say my brother is lying and those logs are absolute truth? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Because Turean, and wrap your head around this for a second: there is no middle ground. Again, I've ceded that Trolo could just be wrong. Fine. He's just wrong. Tell him so, and that will do nicely. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
I have lived with him and known him a fucking lot longer than you, obviously, and one thing he is not, is a liar or underhanded.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's funny, I'd call shooting tells at anyone and everyone he could find online, and trying to convince them that somehow Aesclepius and Alinor are the devil and horrible people, before guild removing, without discussing any issues he may have had in his mind with them in any way, that sounds pretty underhanded to me, and is part of the reason that I would be just as happy to hear that his online persona got hit by a truck. If you don't know his underhanded side, maybe you should rethink your candy coated view of little brother. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
so what is to say he is lying when he did not see any camp calls in /ooc? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, lets assume that his attention rate was 100% as you suggest it's easy to accomplish. <br>
<br>
He missed the camp checks. They're in the logs that you, your own self, have said you don't believe to be falsified. <br>
<br>
INCONGRUITY!!! WARNING WARNING WARNING. <br>
<br>
If he's honestly just wrong, then I apologize for calling him a liar, he's just ignorant to the situation. My bad, I'll make sure to be aware of the differance when dealing with this subject in the future. <br>
<br>
So yeah, at a 100% attention rate, if he says he missed all the camp checks, he lies. If he, you know, *didn't* pay 100% attention, made a sandwitch, talked on the phone, watched a little TV... than he can't come here and say &quot;Oh, there were no camp checks, stop the hate&quot;. <br>
<br>
And no, it is not *just* the logs, reapeated from *both sides* now. It's not *just* that I've dealt with Kenshiiro in the past, and find him to be every bit as conniving now as I did then, except now he's on a larger scale. It's not *just* any one single thing that says, to me, yeah, CoN have this right, and SoY are doing damage control and spinning this to the best of their ability. It's every impression I've had about Yama Clan/SoY since the moment I noticed their numbers growing on the Rathe. <br>
<br>
From the day I saw your brother tagged with them, I had to laugh to myself. (Binamar I mean). Binamar, the same guy that cracked off on Zephyrr in guildchat about absolutely nothing at all.  (which to those of you who don't know her, is the verbal equivilent of hitting a rabbit with a baseball bat, she was never anything but motherly and caring to the members of the guild while she was in it- disagreements at the officer level, sure, but nothing but helpful to the members). <br>
<br>
It was funny to watch the ranks of the Yammabushi Clan grow and swell with people who I remember being trouble makers and selfish brats as I levelled up. When it was a guild of level 40's who played with themselves, no one cared. Under the radar is the term. <br>
<br>
Sure, no problem, guild disbands, reforms as SoY. We all roll our eyes, and think, ok, well, whatever. <br>
<br>
Then, you know, we see them on rotations, killin mobs, well, alright, sure, change our minds slowly, alright. Hell, Alinor the other day in our officers channel said that SoY had come a long way, really progressed in a way that she didn't think was possible from the beginnings that the guild had. We all grudgingly agreed and went on with life. <br>
<br>
Then, heaven opens up and restores the faith I have in the lowest common denominator. <br>
<br>
Yeah, I'd safe to say that the reputation follows the people, and the people follow the reputation. <br>
<br>
And really, frankly, I don't care how they play, or talk, or act, as long as it doesn't infringe on the other people on the server, as it has this time. If they wanna go play in the sandbox, and can manage to play nice with everyone, they could be taking flying leaps off the top of the Avatar of war for all I care, or farming Vex Thal. <br>
<br>
But they don't play nice, as evidenced by this, and not only are not visibly sorry about it, have people that come to their defense and say &quot;oh, gee, what's a gentlemans agreement? we're on Sullon Zek, right?&quot;, in almost as few words. <br>
<br>
You want to know the last time I said anything remotely close to &quot;yeah, let them wipe, we'll kill the mob after this&quot; was? <br>
<br>
Oh, about a quarter past NEVER. <br>
<br>
Now, for the crux of this post:<br>
<br>
Some of you may be wondering why, exactly, I'm so vehement about this?<br>
<br>
Well, I can think one of two things. <br>
<br>
1. SoY will implode or explode and scatter their people all around the game.<br>
<br>
2. SoY will continue to play their own special way, and grow at whatever pace they grow at, into new mobs and new things. <br>
<br>
If 1 is the option, no skin off my nose.<br>
<br>
If number 2, however, is the option, they are damn well going to learn that there are other people on this server, and we don't operate on a 'take take take, oh... and take' basis. <br>
<br>
If they don't learn that, then someday it won't be CoN who get rolled over, it will be *my guild*. Like I said, I don't care if they raid on pogo sticks with clerics tanking and warriors in a bind wound rotation. So long as their fun doesn't ruin it for someone else in such an obvious way. <br>
<br>
In CoN's shoes, there but for the grace of god go I, and all my guildmates. <br>
<br>
We, as people and players, should not have to put up with that crap. <br>
<br>
Ignoring conventions is easy to start, and probably difficult to stop for some. That's a slippery slope that no one wants to get on. <br>
<br>
But eh, why bother, this post will fall to deaf ears. It's obvious that SoY actually feel that if they are not right, that they are at least 'not wrong'. <br>

Quite a contribution on this threads first night.<br>
<br>
Oddly enough, I came here looking for any bad words that I have said about YBC. Belec gave me a tell last night, and he flipped out on me, saying how I should stop shit-talking YBC.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I had no clue what the hell he was talking about, especially since hes a *cough* Tindi now, and YBC is dead. He then went on to attempt, it seemed, to turn me against my guildmates, specifically Bogfather, but frankly I could give a rats ass why &quot;Bogfather doesnt like Belec&quot;. I like Bogfather, and he's so far been great in our guild. Thats all I give a shit about.<br>

Anyhow, Its quite possible that Raitlin was the only one who knew that CoN had Vindi claimed, and conveniently neglected to inform Ken.

Rogg, I have always held the utmost respect for you, but that low-blow on Trolo really made me lose some.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
/shrug Truth hurts a little eh? I know he's your brother, and that's nice that you stick up for him. Really, I mean it. <br>
<br>
Pick the battles tho eh?<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
So basically what you are saying is, now let me get this straight...<br>
<br>
That what CoN says is absolutely true, because they have logs, yet when someone comes here, who is not on either side and tells their story, its false and bullshit?<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Who came here that wasn't on SoY's side? It's nice that Trolo feels he should defend his brothers guild, and I respect the brothers keeper routine you are doing too, but there are TWO possible theories here. <br>
<br>
1. The logs are false, and Trolo is telling the truth, along with all the Yama's. <br>
<br>
2. The logs are real, and trolo is either lying or misinformed (though I suspect at least a little willfully misinformed.<br>
<br>
The two are mutually exclusive: <br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I am not saying they are fake or edited, but how can you call him a liar?<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll admit, Trolo could be just grossly misinformed, maybe by word of mouth, or what he wants to believe, or whatever. He could be telling what he thinks the truth is. He's wrong, but that's neither here nor there. <br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Fuck that. How can you say my brother is lying and those logs are absolute truth? <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
Because Turean, and wrap your head around this for a second: there is no middle ground. Again, I've ceded that Trolo could just be wrong. Fine. He's just wrong. Tell him so, and that will do nicely. <br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I have lived with him and known him a fucking lot longer than you, obviously, and one thing he is not, is a liar or underhanded.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That's funny, I'd call shooting tells at anyone and everyone he could find online, and trying to convince them that somehow Aesclepius and Alinor are the devil and horrible people, before guild removing, without discussing any issues he may have had in his mind with them in any way, that sounds pretty underhanded to me, and is part of the reason that I would be just as happy to hear that his online persona got hit by a truck. If you don't know his underhanded side, maybe you should rethink your candy coated view of little brother. <br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
so what is to say he is lying when he did not see any camp calls in /ooc? <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, lets assume that his attention rate was 100% as you suggest it's easy to accomplish. <br>
<br>
He missed the camp checks. They're in the logs that you, your own self, have said you don't believe to be falsified. <br>
<br>
INCONGRUITY!!! WARNING WARNING WARNING. <br>
<br>
If he's honestly just wrong, then I apologize for calling him a liar, he's just ignorant to the situation. My bad, I'll make sure to be aware of the differance when dealing with this subject in the future. <br>
<br>
So yeah, at a 100% attention rate, if he says he missed all the camp checks, he lies. If he, you know, *didn't* pay 100% attention, made a sandwitch, talked on the phone, watched a little TV... than he can't come here and say &quot;Oh, there were no camp checks, stop the hate&quot;. <br>
<br>
And no, it is not *just* the logs, reapeated from *both sides* now. It's not *just* that I've dealt with Kenshiiro in the past, and find him to be every bit as conniving now as I did then, except now he's on a larger scale. It's not *just* any one single thing that says, to me, yeah, CoN have this right, and SoY are doing damage control and spinning this to the best of their ability. It's every impression I've had about Yama Clan/SoY since the moment I noticed their numbers growing on the Rathe. <br>
<br>
From the day I saw your brother tagged with them, I had to laugh to myself. (Binamar I mean). Binamar, the same guy that cracked off on Zephyrr in guildchat about absolutely nothing at all. (which to those of you who don't know her, is the verbal equivilent of hitting a rabbit with a baseball bat, she was never anything but motherly and caring to the members of the guild while she was in it- disagreements at the officer level, sure, but nothing but helpful to the members). <br>
<br>
It was funny to watch the ranks of the Yammabushi Clan grow and swell with people who I remember being trouble makers and selfish brats as I levelled up. When it was a guild of level 40's who played with themselves, no one cared. Under the radar is the term. <br>
<br>
Sure, no problem, guild disbands, reforms as SoY. We all roll our eyes, and think, ok, well, whatever. <br>
<br>
Then, you know, we see them on rotations, killin mobs, well, alright, sure, change our minds slowly, alright. Hell, Alinor the other day in our officers channel said that SoY had come a long way, really progressed in a way that she didn't think was possible from the beginnings that the guild had. We all grudgingly agreed and went on with life. <br>
<br>
Then, heaven opens up and restores the faith I have in the lowest common denominator. <br>
<br>
Yeah, I'd safe to say that the reputation follows the people, and the people follow the reputation. <br>
<br>
And really, frankly, I don't care how they play, or talk, or act, as long as it doesn't infringe on the other people on the server, as it has this time. If they wanna go play in the sandbox, and can manage to play nice with everyone, they could be taking flying leaps off the top of the Avatar of war for all I care, or farming Vex Thal. <br>
<br>
But they don't play nice, as evidenced by this, and not only are not visibly sorry about it, have people that come to their defense and say &quot;oh, gee, what's a gentlemans agreement? we're on Sullon Zek, right?&quot;, in almost as few words. <br>
<br>
You want to know the last time I said anything remotely close to &quot;yeah, let them wipe, we'll kill the mob after this&quot; was? <br>
<br>
Oh, about a quarter past NEVER. <br>
<br>
Now, for the crux of this post:<br>
<br>
Some of you may be wondering why, exactly, I'm so vehement about this?<br>
<br>
Well, I can think one of two things. <br>
<br>
1. SoY will implode or explode and scatter their people all around the game.<br>
<br>
2. SoY will continue to play their own special way, and grow at whatever pace they grow at, into new mobs and new things. <br>
<br>
If 1 is the option, no skin off my nose.<br>
<br>
If number 2, however, is the option, they are damn well going to learn that there are other people on this server, and we don't operate on a 'take take take, oh... and take' basis. <br>
<br>
If they don't learn that, then someday it won't be CoN who get rolled over, it will be *my guild*. Like I said, I don't care if they raid on pogo sticks with clerics tanking and warriors in a bind wound rotation. So long as their fun doesn't ruin it for someone else in such an obvious way. <br>
<br>
In CoN's shoes, there but for the grace of god go I, and all my guildmates. <br>
<br>
We, as people and players, should not have to put up with that crap. <br>
<br>
Ignoring conventions is easy to start, and probably difficult to stop for some. That's a slippery slope that no one wants to get on. <br>
<br>
But eh, why bother, this post will fall to deaf ears. It's obvious that SoY actually feel that if they are not right, that they are at least 'not wrong'. <br>
<br>
yers,<br>

Initially I was somewhat sorry to see this thread.  Now that I have had the dubious pleasure to read posts by the more intellectual individuals present, most notably Roggulbuk, I am glad that this thread exists as it sheds some light on a phenomenon that I have experienced.<br>
<br>
I have played on The Rathe for more than 2 years and have made some friends, quite literally all over the world.  I have encountered very few people that I could actively dislike.  There have been a number of players that I didn't want to assosciate with, for one reason or another, but mostly my experience has been a pleasant one.  After reading this thread, I know why I have had a pleasant experience in EQ.<br>
<br>
It seems that the most obnoxious, irritating and ignorant person on The Rathe spends endless hours posting and flaming on a subject that they know nothing about.  In case this needs clarification, Roggulbuk I am talking about you.  Thanks for spending your time here and leaving The Rathe free from your taint.<br>
<br>
I stated previously that I saw nobody call Vindi until Kenshiiro /OOC'd that we were pulling him.  I stated previously that I would have been just as happy had CoN been successful.<br>
<br>
Despite the fecal matter which flows so generously from the mouths of Roggulbuk and his ilk, I am still sorry that this event occurred.  I can assure you that had I seen Vindi called by another guild, SoY would not have attempted him.  I can likewise assure you that had *any* SoY officer seen this, we would not have attempted Vindi.  Whether this is believed or not by the ignorant masses posting here that were not present, is of little concern to me.  Anyone who has had dealings with me knows that I wouldn't bother lie.  The fact of the matter is, I have no reason to be untruthful.  In order for me to lie, I would have to care about what you think and I don't.  Flame all you want.  Lie all you want.  I am not losing sleep over it.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry that CoN feels cheated.  I am certain that if the leadership of CoN contacts me in game, a solution or resolution can be reached.  I am equally certain that ignorant antagonists like Roggulbuk and company will ignore my offer and continue to flame.  Please do.  Every second that you spend here gives the denizens of The Rathe that much more time away from you.  Again, I would like one of the CoN leadership to contact me in game.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Ryzel<br>

Exactly the reason that everyone is fighting so vehemently on the same side of CoN.  Not for the good of the server's reputation, not to smear Yama because we're soar about them guilding an idiot, but because we want to protect our friends, and allies.  The reputation comes second.<br>
<br>
I hope that Yama smarten up honestly :/ I thought they were improving, but this just reconfirms their lame attitude and the evidence of them having lame members.  The &quot;LMAO they pulled him&quot; comment reminded me of a certain guild saying &quot;it's so good being bad,&quot; grats.<br>

<br>
I was reading thru this post and wanted to point out some inconsistencies that stood out to me. I wont touch on the initial camp check because I am sure that if you read the entire post you understood that CoN informed SoY that Vindi was already taken. The points that I don¡¯t want to touch on are:<br>
<br>
1. The idea that was stated about no conversation between SoY and CoN prior to the /ooc that was done while both guilds were in arena area. I ran into some logs statements that disprove this. The logs showed that SoY was told again that CoN was there to take out Vindi. These logs looked like they where from the time frame in-between SoY initial zone in till the setup in Arena area. (Key phrases are in Bold for easy of reading)<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>[Mon Nov 04 21:17:16 2002] Seanus tells the guild, 'they were asking about vindi... told him he's ours'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
2. The idea that was stated that SoY did not pressure CoN into pulling early, but rather backed off immediately and let them have a shot. The logs I found in the post that show that SoY did in fact pressure CoN into pulling early by stating that they where going to pull Vindi even after Kenshiiro ( GL - SoY I presume ) publicly acknowledged in /ooc the fact that CoN also had an interest in Vindi. *Note: I stated acknowledged that they had an interest in vindi not acknowledged they had a claim*.  By the logs posted, Kenshiiro did indeed blow CoN off without trying to figure out what was going on and stated 'we are Pulling Vindi through Right arena ina few secs...just watch out'   To a reasonable person, this would suggest that SoY was not going to try and work out an arrangement or ( as it was stated repeatedly in previous post) back off immediately and let CoN have a shot. If it would have been me, I would have also felt like SoY were about to steamroll me. Logs that I formed this opinion from are below. *Please also not that the below logs were taken from a different local client than the above. The client used above seems to be in a time zone that is one hour ahead of the client used below.<br>

<br>
Please note the statements  Kenshiiro makes in the first few posts acknowledging the fact that CoN was also in zone for vindi. Then in the last statement he goes ahead and disregards CoN and gives a warning that SoY is pulling Vindi and to &quot;just watch out&quot;.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that maybe there was some misunderstanding to begin with between CoN and SoY as a guilds, although select individuals in SoY where fully aware of what was going on and either failed their guild by not informing the proper officers of CoN presence and intent or blatantly disregarded CoN all together. I draw this conclusion from the initial camp check done by a SoY member before the rest of SoY even zoned in. Also by the log post that Seanus ( CoN ) stated in guild chat that he had informed SoY that they were there for vindi, prior to SoY being fully mobilized inside the Arena area.<br>
<br>
It also seems to me that SoY, either by being neglectant or lack of consideration, did in fact publicly ( /ooc ) pressure CoN into pulling before they where prepared.<br>
<br>
P.S. I do not know or associate with anyone from either CoN or SoY, but dislike the Rathe community forming opinions about players or guilds without fully looking into what facts where presented to them. I also freely submit the fact that all these opinions where formed from what facts that were presented by CoN logs and that so far I have seen no logs for SoY to dispute them.<br>

I would think an officer of SoY would already know this, but I'll tell you if you don't.  <br>
<br>
SoY was removed from the Statue rotation because you used a non-guild member as your Main Tank on the Statue fight.  Nyca added you to the rotation before she had knowledge of this violation, and then you were removed later.  Myself and others later talked to Kenshiiro and it was decided to add SoY to the Statue rotation on a trial basis, so you would have another try to kill without any invites. <p><P><A HREF="http://www.jakefitch.com/asb/char_detail.asp?Name=Milambus" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://jakefitch.com/sig/eq/sig1.jpg" HEIGHT="150" WIDTH="400" ALT="Milambus Mandragon" BORDER="0"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=belacyamabushi>BelacYamabushi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/6/02 8:17:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=819.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yamabushi</span><hr size=1> I have a ton of respect for SOY and Kenshirro, so I hope all works out between these two guilds.
