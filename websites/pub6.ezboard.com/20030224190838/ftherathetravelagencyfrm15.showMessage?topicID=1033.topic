Having played for four years on and off you'd think I've learned not to trust anyone.  Unfortunately the little naivete that remained got to me.<br>
<br>
Selling Blood Ember Gauntlets and a Bracer, I received a tell from one &quot;Razir&quot;.  We agreed that he'd give me 2k for both items.  Great...then he gives me the &quot;But I want the items on this character and the money is on my chanter&quot;.  Suspicious, I tell him how bout you just give me the money first?  We go back and forth like this for a bit until I give up...I'm impatient because I need the money right now, so I tell him to prove to me he has the chanter by logging it on and then we'll do the deal his way.  Chanter logs on (Name is &quot;Freezee&quot;) I tell him fine.<br>
<br>
I give him the two items, and he tells me he'll be back with &quot;Freezee&quot; (who does exist).  Needless to say, the money was never given to me.<br>
<br>
Yes, I was dumb for doing it.  But I had been in that situation a number of times before and I *always* gave the person the money even when I could have walked away with some free items.  &quot;Razir&quot; a bard, and &quot;Freezee&quot; an enchanter are NOT TO BE TRUSTED!  <br>
<br>
But I'm not done yet!  After warning everyone in the zone about this scum, I receive a tell from Seuche about the same little bastard.  Apparently Seuche had bad dealings with Razir before, and Razir was also fond of harassing and calling people &quot;fags&quot; for whatever reason he could establish.  (This gives you an idea of the age of the little scumbag)<br>
<br>
Seuche will back me up on this one.  DO NOT TRUST RAZIR, FREEZEE, or any other of his characters if you know him.  I know I won't be getting the items back, but I wanna see this asshole go down real hard.  Anyone with more info on him is appreciated.<br>
<br>
Hoping thieves and liars will become Satan's playthings...<br>

<br>
Shrakk, I don't understand why you allowed this to happen. Why didn't you get the money when he logged Freezee on? Was it because Freezee was stuck in another zone somewhere? He would have had to have gotten Freezee to you anyway to pay you after you gave his other toon the items.<br>
<br>
You said you were impatient because you needed the money ASAP, but transacting his way wouldn't have gotten you the money any faster than if you had forced him to give you the money first. I could see you tempted to go this route if you were impatient to clear inventory space or something, but the money reason doesn't make any sense.<br>
<br>
I hate that there are people who try to screw others, but this is a cheat that should never have happened. You obviously saw the risk here.<br>

Not sure what may have happened, but I am positive that this is not the original Razir.  Razir Nocturnus was my duoing partner for about 25 levels, and was a very mature, very honorable individual.  We were both around 50/51 when he decided that EQ interfered too much with RL and stopped playing.  He gave away all the gear that was on his SK and his kitty rogue, Sylvix, and cancelled the account.  I have never heard of the enchanter's name.  I do hope that whoever is abusing my friend's name pays for it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And no THIS IS NOT Razir the former Shadowknight.  I knew Razir the Shadowknight as well and he was a great, great guy.

I ran into him over something and I guess I deserved it with my temper, I was called a fag too. OH NO THE PAIN! This is his favorite word...&quot;fag&quot;. I believe this story 100%, thats his word he uses every second. Anyway, I know this child is a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">level 25 Bard</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, because when I first asked about this &quot;too good to be true&quot; deal, he didn't have anon up yet. Now I know why his shit is cheap, he steals it.<br>
<br>
In a couple hours, I heard 2 people in /ooc them asking if anyone knew who his main was. A Paladin friend of mine had a bad time with him explained his story last night about <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">10:00 PM EST</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> about how this fucker tried to trick him into some pally gear trade and then &quot;borrow&quot; an item to see what it looks like on him or some shit. I believe 20 or so people must have delt with him by now. This kid has a high level paladin because when I investigated what this Pally victim said, he told me about Razir having a high level Paladin that was once, or is a part of a guild. Razir CLAIMED to be in Neo Dracus but thats only HIS CLAIM so we don't know for sure.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I don't think we should act like it is Shraak's fault for trusting him. The guy apparently speaks as if he has legit high level characters. I lately have been even trusting N00bs to do transfers when friends aren't online and it's been going good so far. I thought the Rathe has seen the last of the &quot;logout artists&quot; as I call them.<br>
I think I spend too much time in bazaar. I meet too many idiots.<br>
<br>
Galactis, you're cool in my book to hand over things to help this guy. I retract my daygo statement I made last year to you. I've only once been burned by letting someone &quot;borrow&quot; something and them log off. <br>
<br>
I'm not making fun of you for trusting him. I will just let you know that GMs usually have the &quot;all trades final&quot; policy going on and it's best to trust nobody unless it's a high level character with his guild tag showing.<br>
<br>
He is not an adult. I know this because he spoke of something of needing to hurry up and sell everything fast because he had school in the morning. Another dickless child in our game. I still say you should be 18+ to play EQ. No offense to anyone not 18, theres always Sony Playstation.<br>

<br>
I don't care that much about getting the two items back.  Yes they were worth about 2k and no I'm not rich, but I can get over that.  What I'd really like to see is this little punk kid, who has obviously screwed with other people, get punished in some way.  To be honest part of the reason I trusted him was because he had the name Razir, and thus I kinda assumed he may have been the former Shadowknight's character.  He is certainly not, and he's reflecting badly on that name even though he has nothing to do with the former Razir.<br>
<br>
Galactis, I truly appreciate your offer.  I could not accept it however, because this was really partially my own fault, and at any rate as I said, its going to screw up some plans I had for buying quest gems, but its not going to break me.<br>

Actually I did petition immediately after and included both names of his characters, saying that I didn't care as much about the items as I did about him being punished.  Needless to say a GM has yet to contact me.<br>
<br>
I logged the text at the last moment, unfortunately this is all I got...I cut out the text of people auctioning =/  (His 1999p and 9gold comment is referring to me telling him 2k and him trying to play with me saying, how bout 1999p and 9gold)<br>
<br>
Razir tells you, '1999p and 9gold =p'<br>
[Thu Feb 06 00:39:13 2003] You told Razir, 'lol'<br>
[Thu Feb 06 00:39:18 2003] You told Razir, '2k! hehe'<br>
<br>
[Thu Feb 06 00:39:31 2003] Razir tells you, 'and 9 silver?'<br>
[Thu Feb 06 00:39:42 2003] You told Razir, 'lol, just bring it to me here '<br>

[Thu Feb 06 00:39:53 2003] There is 1 player in The Bazaar.<br>
[Thu Feb 06 00:40:00 2003] Razir tells you, 'k brb on freezee he in nexus'<br>
[Thu Feb 06 00:40:07 2003] You told Razir, 'cool'<br>
<br>
Notice I tried to get him to admit in this text that there was a deal for 2k, because I sensed what might be coming <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I know its not proof enough for a GM, but I think you guys believe me, and that is worth more to me than the lies a GM could spout.<br>
