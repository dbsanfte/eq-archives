<br>
An Epic Calendar is created and utilized by guilds that can pass the 5th Island in sky.<br>
<br>
The only time a Guild from the Epic calendar is called upon, is when The current group in Fear/Hate/Air cant complete the zone or kill the God if its up. That group then calls the guild on the Epic calendar for that day to help clear the zone. Should this situation arrise, The Epic calendar group gets no loot from any mob save for epic quest mobs. ALL other loot goes to the original Group.<br>

<br>
Calendar Guidelines:<br>
<br>
1. 1 day raids for Fear and Hate, 2 day raids in Sky<br>
2. only 1 raid of the same plane at a time<br>
3. must have a minimum of 18 planable people in the raid.<br>
4. at least 2/3 must be in same guild or alliance. Example if you have 18 peeps - 12 must be in same posting guild or posting alliance. Which also means that if you want to apply to post on the calendar, you should have 12 planable characters at least from the same guild/alliance.<br>
5. you may not post multiple raids for the same day.<br>
<br>
Those are the 5 big ones.<br>
<br>
<br>
6. have a big brother guild on standby in case you can't clear, specially if it's pretty obvious that you cant.<br>
7. Independent raids will be handled on a case by case basis. If you are already part of a posting organization, you do not qualify for an independent raid.<br>
----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Also, it seems that the posting page has been taken off-line.  I'm assuming that this was done until such time as a resolution to the current situation can be made?  Or is this permanent?  Either way, something should be said.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> </font><P><B><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#ffffff">Edwina Nytengayle<BR>

<br>
If a guild is in fear and refuses to admit they have enough to get to cazic who is in charge of making the judgement call for them?  The other thing is that this rule is very open to abuses without some sort of &quot;governor&quot; over it IMO.<br>
<br>
Reason being is Friday night I was chilling in fear with whichever guild was there (I forget) and they thought that they could get cazic even though at 11:00 EST they had barely cleared to the portal.  <br>
<br>
I have also been in fear when 2 other guilds have thought the same thing and yet started off exceptionally late and were not able to sustain the needed people in order to get the god killed.<br>
<br>
The smaller guilds will always believe they can take out cazic yet I would propose that a collective relatively impartial body be able to determine by some set time (I would propose 9:00 EST) whether said guild has a viable shot at the god before their time is up and then be able to intervene.<br>
<br>
Most of us who have done fear repeatedly knows that cazic up and 18 to 24 people equates to minimum of 8 to 9 hours of relatively intense pulling (unless the people are all 60 and fully geared / experienced,etc) to take out cazic simply due to med time vs firepower.<br>
<br>
The people I would put up for being able to determine this would be a minimum of 2 officers from each of the guilds who have passed the &quot;test&quot; (although I still believe clearing to 7th isle in sky..5 is entirely too easy) who are online and have a majority vote taken by each of them that are online at the time.  This rule would be blanketing enough that the bigger guilds couldn't simply determine that on every cazic spawn,etc that whichever guild was in there couldn't do it because there are a few guilds who can take out the gods on weekdays (MFH comes to mind) yet the majority of them cannot.  The entire flaming session,etc came to the forefront because of wasted resources which is what these rules are trying to alleviate.<br>
<br>
Just my .02 on what I think would be better for everyone involved and if you want to costructively criticize it then please do so.  If you want to flame, then call some 900 sex line and talk dirty to them all you want.<br>

&quot;Big Brother&quot; gets nothing out of the deal save for Epic Loot. All other loot goes to the guild on the raid including the god loot. So.........<br>
<br>
Having &quot;Big Brother&quot; there means you get more PhAt lEwT (tm) and you learn tactics to defeat the god/clear the zone succesfully the next time you go.<br>
<br>
Not having &quot;Big Brother&quot; there means you get owned/dont complete the zone/screwed on the loot/dont learn anything new for the next time you go.<br>
<br>
If Im a smaller guild/group in fear for the first time with a god up or Im getting started late, your damn skippy Im calling my &quot;Big Brother&quot;.</font><P>Sir Sarel<br>

This way it isn't subjective.<br>
<br>
IE, if the maestro isnt dead by 10-11PST, hate more than likely won't be cleared, and niether will Innoruk...so someone coming in to help is reasonable.<br>
<br>
As for fear, you could key off of Fright or terror on a similar timeline.<br>
<br>
And as for people who are &quot;Big brother&quot; guilds, I think that clearing island 5 in sky is a reasonable test.  However, if you are up for a night to be big brother and fail to clear the plane, you should have your Big brother rights revoked for the next 2 raids you are normally scheduled for.  If it becomes habitual (ie less than a 2/3rds success rate over 9 attempts) you are removed from the BB calander for 2 months.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilambus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milambus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Toede</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>4</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>10/30/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>10:56:24 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Just one question.</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Hmm, the time limit might work.<br>
<br>
Another idea would be, if a guild/alliance does not kill the God and they do not call in a &quot;Big Brother&quot; then their posting rights are revoked for a time period.  First offense - 1 month?  Second = 3?<br>
<br>
It's a little more draconina, but also less baby-sitting.  Someone just has to pop up to the Plane in the morning to see if the God is still up.  </font><P>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

<br>
1 Sar /tell me in game at some point.  No offense but human nature won't allow people to ask for help.  I've offered to bring CIW into fear to help towards just this goal before to a guild that could not get to cazic in time.  The following night BoTS made the same offer to a guild that was in there.  Ended up cazic up for 3 days extra.  The point that the entire &quot;big 3&quot; are making is that we (we as in server wide whether you realize it or not) do NOT want gods / epic FA spawns left up 1 minute longer than absolutely necessary.  Every day that cazic is left up is 1 more day longer that he will not pop again for the server as a whole.  Therein lies the problem.<br>
<br>
2 Nowhere in my post did I talk about retributive actions against any guild that either didn't call in the big guild or any big guild that could not muster up the forces.  The time limit was placed in my idea very fairly with no regards to saying which creatures to pull,etc simply because the majority of us play during prime time hours and I can assure you I don't want to stick around till 3 and 4 EST killing cazic and giving all loot to some guild that possibly couldn't have done it without us.  I'd rather have the people on the &quot;council&quot; decide it very early in the night so that we can zone in 3 to 5 groups, destroy everything in sight and go to bed at a reasonable hour.<br>

No matter how you look at it there is a win-win situation for the SERVER as a whole as well as the guild who is in there.  Honestly I could care less which guild was in there so long as cazic dies in a timely / efficient manner.  Them not getting choice loot doesn't concern me.  Gods dying concerns me.  Short, simple, sweet.  The entire issue came up because gods were not being killed.  Honestly IMO the entire &quot;Announcement&quot; was about that one very thing.  Until the other guilds can kill cazic in a timely / efficient manner so as to allow the server as a whole chances at the epic quest items needed then someone has to make that decision on how to handle it and I believe that having 3 to 4 guilds with representatives will be much more soothing to people than 3 to 4 people will be.<br>

Spirit of Tunare had Hate Saturday.<br>
<br>
We routinely start our raids at 10 am est because of our large amount of european players.<br>
<br>
We had the zone cleared of statics by 3pm est (the guild from the night before hadn't started untill late so we practically had a 2 hour wait for spawns)<br>
<br>
Anyways, Maestro needless to say didn't spawn untill much later that evening, we took a break and came back and killed him when he spawned.<br>
<br>
Time limits in my opinion won't work because on weeknights some guilds won't get to him untill late and then you have the choice of waiting or missing him on the weekend.  Basically his spawn was messed up all weekend because of it.<br>
<br>
Just my observation, some guilds like to do uber late clearings, and they won't get it done even if it's only 3 hours into their raid when the time limit kicks in.</font><P>Thundaron <BR>

I agree that in cases like that something should be done, that will be an issue that should be worked out.<br>
<br>
Same is true in First time in plane clearing situations, first time thru hate or fear is messy if you don't have many veterans in your guild.<br>

I tried to keep them simple and to the point and still convey the ideas that have been bouncing around.<br>
<br>
========================<br>
<br>
Suggested new rules:<br>
<br>
Plane schedule calendar:<br>
1. Groups can reserve 1 day in fear, 1 day in hate, and 2 days in sky (sky cannot be both weekend days).<br>
2. Groups must have a minimum of 18 players in the raid and must remain off anonmous.<br>
3. Guilds and alliances cannot invite more than 6 members from any other single group.<br>
4. Groups must agree to ask for help from the guild listed on the epic calendar if <br>
they are unable to completely clear the plane within 8 hours of starting and an epic spawn is present.<br>
<br>
Epic item &quot;backup calendar&quot;:<br>
1. Groups must agree to clear the plane without looting anything but the epic items.<br>
2. Groups cannot post on this calendar unless they have cleared the 5th island in sky.<br>
3. Groups agree that certian items are not epic items, but are used in epic items (soul leach).<br>
<br>
========================<br>
<br>
After reading all the posts, I saw a couple good ideas that I put in those suggestions:<br>
<br>
The &quot;within 8 hours of starting&quot; is 2/3rds the time.  Most guilds can either complete the plane with the god in that time or be close enough that they will know it.  The wording with &quot;ask&quot; is important.  The guilds must ask for help, not be forced to accept it if it is not needed.<br>
<br>
I also suggested a small change in the 2/3rds rule.  Instead of counting the number present and seeing if 2/3rds are of the proper guild - instead why not prevent more than one group from any other guild to be present?  That would allow a guild of 18 to invite 12 unguilded players that need armor but would prevent a guild to invite their buddy guild that is also posting.  The idea is to prevent as much armor decay as possible without allowing rampt abuse like before.  (I have been turned down on a couple raids, even though there were no paladins needing a helm (the last piece I need) there because the guild there already was at the 2/3rds cap. Had one dropped it would have decayed instead of completing my set.)<br>

<br>
Foundation Rathe (Black Talons, Everlasting Alliance, League of Levity) have more than enough people to be a Big Brother entity... the question then becomes do we wish to be such a thing? We will have to discuss it among our members before such a decision can be reached but I would like to clarify a few points before our members are asked their opinions on being a Big Brother.<br>
<br>
1) Why the rotation of the Big Brother guilds? Whatever group is in the Plane should feel free to call upon whichever BB suits them best. The part I see causing the most problems is this... Group A is in Fear and knows they cant clear it and kill CT... they *want* help but dont like/have problems with the BB listed for that day. This alone might prevent Group A from calling in the BB &quot;on call&quot; that day. Why not let the group in the Plane decide? Mandating which group they &quot;must&quot; call upon to assist them fosters ill-will and ultimately will cause some groups to NOT call upon a BB. <br>
<br>
2) If a schedule for BB's IS decided upon we would have to set some sort of reasonable time limits for both sides. Members of FR are adults with husbands/wives/children/jobs and as such we cant possibly expect our members to stay up til 4am on a weekday... this alone might prevent FR from being a BB. If Group A is only 1/2 done with a Plane and calls on the BB at 1am is it the fault of the BB if the Plane isnt cleared and the god dead? Realistic timelines would have to be agreed upon for this to work.<br>
<br>
3) Would the BB's make some groups &quot;dependant&quot; on us? We all had to learn how to clear the Planes at some point and learning how was the challenge. But I can also see some groups abusing this (and ultimately the BB's). If a group can not clear a Plane and has to call upon the BBs multiple times who is really benefitting? True, the BB's are getting a &quot;slight&quot; chance at an Epic Quest piece that may or may not drop but I wonder if this will prompt some groups who have not been posting dates to post knowing they can call in the BB's to get the ph4t l3wt for their members? We do all the work and they reap all the benefits? How many times will a group be allowed to call upon the BBs for assistance? At some point EVERY posting group will have to stand alone... some limits on this would need to be discussed to prevent the abuse of the BBs and to prompt all posting entities to learn the tactics to clear Planes and kill gods on their own.<br>
<br>
4) What happens if a group calls upon a BB to assist them... the BB responds and help the group clear the Plane and kill the God and then the group decides to NOT allow the BB to loot the Epic Quest item? (ie a Soul Leach drops and the group has an SK who wants it while the BB who helped them also has an SK who needs it for their Epic Quest) This might be a very rare occurance but the possibility for this does exsist. What sanctions will be taken against such a group?<br>
<br>
5) What items will be declared &quot;Epic Quest Items&quot;? The Staff of Elemental Mastery Earth is a very nice item for every Mage... unfortunately it's also part of the Mage Epic Quest. Does it fall under &quot;regular&quot; god loot or &quot;epic quest&quot; loot? Very clear guidelines would have to be established and agreed upon.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am still not sold on this idea of an Epic Quest calendar... I see far too many issues that still need to be worked out. The LAST thing Foundation Rathe wants is to appear as a vulture just waiting a chance to pounce and snatch an Epic Quest item... having said that tho, I do think most of our members would be more than willing to assist any group who calls upon us. I too wish all of my people to have thier FA weapons as quickly as possible but we must remember common courtesy. To deny a group the chance to kill a god on their own is wrong... we all tried and failed... should we not allow others the same opportunities we had? No one should make the decision for another group regarding their abilities kill a god... and if it means a god stays up for 24 hrs so be it... contrary to popular belief we *gasps in horror* wont die. Zoning in to &quot;check&quot; if the current group has the &quot;numbers&quot; in the Plane to kill a god gives the appearance of sheer unadulterated greed and one I dont think FR members will be party to.<br>
<br>
None of my post is intended to flame or shoot down this idea... but I do think we have a few more points to clarify for this to work without causing problems. I would encourage rational and mature discussions to ensure we do NOT infringe upon the RIGHTS (yes... RIGHTS) of other players on the Rathe.<br>

Example:<br>
 X guild posts as a seperate entity in the planes with 18 needed people. Y guild that is another posting entity joins them at every raid, but has their own plane dates as well.<br>
<br>
i'm not so sure 18 people should be the number needed to become your own posting entity on the calendar. that might have worked when the calendar started sure.. but the rathe has grown in the numbers of people in each entity posting and in the numbers of guilds / alliances that are reserving dates.<br>
<br>
 So here's my suggestion. each Guild / Alliance that can reserve a date have at least 40+ planeable members. ( not accounts - 1 person can own 2 accounts, not characters - you can only use 1 character per account. )<br>
<br>
Every guild / alliance that i know of that goes to the planes Has these numbers already. using the 2/3 rule, means that a guild having 20 people on their raid and wanna bring 10 people from another guild they follow the 2/3 rule. <br>
if they have 30 people in their guild there they can bring 15.<br>
<br>
 Sure 18 people can clear a plane.. rather slowly, but with how many planeable toons on the rathe i dont see people wanting 18 planeable people reserving dates. <br>
<br>
The way i see it is if a guild / alliance doesnt have 40+ planeable toons then they're a newer guild and just starting out, therefor not having the experience needed to clear the planes. If they dont have experience they're gonna need 40 or more people even post 50.<br>
<br>
This would help with &quot; cover up &quot; guilds being used as fronts so people can abuse the system, and it would also stop the abuse of people getting together at level 60 with 18 people and reserving dates.. which as of right now is allowable. <br>
<br>
18 people in the 2/3 rule means they can bring 12 people non guilded. 18 people claiming a plane date means they can front a guild that sends 12 or so people with them for extra plane dates. posting as an entity of 40+ allows you to bring other people if you want. you dont have to have 40 there just 2/3 of them from your guild. just have 40 people in your guild that is planeable to reserve a date.<br>
<br>
This is only my thoughts and i figured i'd present them to see what everyone else thinks. i believe it'd work a lot better than having an 18+ minimum planeable per reservation guild / alliance by far, especially since we have so many people that are planeable nowadays.<br>
God speed the day we get a server split, heh<br>

If FOR doesnt want to be a big brother type deal, they dont have to.<br>
<br>
Look at how many times, this will even occur.<br>
<br>
Patch days, crashes, natural spawns.<br>
<br>
AT best, 4-5 times a month per plane.<br>
<br>
out of the 4-5 how many guilds who have those days reserved, will most likely already be able to kill a god.<br>
<br>
IF you think its gonna be an undue burden on your guild.. /shrug then dont be a big brother.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, your suggestion about why have a rotation. Well thats to keep the Big brother guilds from each other's throat.<br>
<br>
If everyone called on KEG, then BOTS/CIW wouldnt be getting a shot at the Epic quest items.. and well, then the whole thing would fall apart.<br>

couple good points though, being the rotation of the epic quest calendar members.<br>
 rotation would need to be set so each guild in the rotation has an equal number of &quot; set chances &quot; vrs guilds calling in the same guild every time they need help. thus looking like abuse. If the same guild is continually getting called in to take these gods down, they're gonna be considered &quot; greedy &quot; or &quot; favored&quot; and things like that. only fair way to do it with the epic calendar guilds / alliances is to have a set rotation for this to happen.<br>
Just my thoughts on it.<br>
<br>
I think items like soul leech, mage staff off inny, and things like that should go to the epic calendar guilds for 1 reason. they're getting the rest of the loot, and they wouldnt have taken the god down anyhow. sound unreasonable? <br>
think of it this way, if you dont call in someone to help you're not gonna take the god down ( speaking for instance not about anyone specifically ). If you're not gonna be able to take down the god then you wouldnt have gotten it anyhow. when you can take down the god you'll be able to get those epic quest items, thus more reason to learn how to do it.<br>
Again, just my thoughts on it.<br>
If a guild accepts the epic calendar agreement and calendar reservations they've accepted the majority vote that those helping guilds would receive the quest items. i wouldnt think anyone would have a problem with that.<br>
We can hash out the ideas of &quot; well if so and so doesnt coincide then whats their punishment &quot; all year long and that'll go nowhere. Giving the epic quest items to the &quot;Big brother&quot; &quot; or big sister &quot; if ya wanna get specific =) is a very small price for what that posting guild/alliance is offering for everything they get in return. dont think that'll be a problem.<br>
As it is right now i dont see anyone being called in to do this without making a deal for something. this is just a deal for an item that might not even drop.<br>
