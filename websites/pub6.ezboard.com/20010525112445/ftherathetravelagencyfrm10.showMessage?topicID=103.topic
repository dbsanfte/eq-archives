So what?<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter remains that the calendar system does not provide a monopoly or 'control' over the planes to any 'uber' guild or person.<br>
<br>
I'm very impressed with the work that went into making the tactics that everyone uses today to do the planes.<br>
<br>
But just being first doesn't automatically give you the 'right' to have access to something (except for the fact that you can do it better and sooner than everyone else, of course).<br>
<br>
And that's why we have the calendar system we do.<br>
<br>
Don't fall into the trap of trying to justify monopolization of the planes through the calendar.  All the premises you're starting your argument from are wrong.<br>
<br>
* there is no monopoly.<br>
* anyone planeable can go to the planes if they want to.<br>
* it is possible to get planar drops from going on raids.<br>
<br>
To argue that the calendar is a system that provides for monopolization of spawns or excludes others because they were not there first is to argue from false premises.<br>

But what's your point in this?  There where only a few people in our alliance that even went to Fear before our raid.  Believe me, there where tons of mistakes made but that's part of the fun.

False.  You must meet &quot;requirements&quot; set forth by those who are not you in order to be &quot;allowed&quot; to go to the planes.  A monopoly controlled by multiple entities is still a monopoly.  It doesn't have to be one or two controlling entities to be a monopoly.<br>

False.  They can go *if* they follow the rules set forth by others.  They cannot go to the planes if they want to just get a group of 6 people together to go.  They cannot just get their guild together and go whenever they want to if they have not also posted on the calendar for that day.<br>

Briefly:<br>
<br>
I understood the points you were making, and if the original argument were true, I would absolutely agree with you that the calendar system is something that those who worked hard to develop the tactics have earned the right to design.<br>
<br>
I just don't want to see good people getting dragged into the quagmire of &quot;You wouldn't even be able to do this if it wasn't for those who came before you.&quot;  That's irrelevant, in my opinion.  The calendar and the compromise everyone worked so hard on stands all on its own, without any history required.<br>
<br>
But on to the previous message  (and not so briefly) ...<br>
<br>
&gt;| * there is no monopoly.<br>
<br>
&gt;False. You must meet &quot;requirements&quot; set forth by those who <br>
&gt;are not you in order to be &quot;allowed&quot; to go to the planes. <br>
&gt;A monopoly controlled by multiple entities is still<br>
&gt;monopoly. It doesn't have to be one or two controlling <br>
&gt;entities to be a monopoly.<br>
<br>
You are right.  a monopoly controlled by several entities can still be a monopoly.  But please show me where 'A' becomes 'Not-A' in this situation:<br>
<br>
2 guilds create the calendar system and say this is the way.<br>
3 guilds create a new system and say this is the way.<br>
...<br>
n+1 guilds create a calendar system and say this is the way.<br>
<br>
at which point does it stop being a monopoly, and become a consensus?<br>
<br>
&gt;| * anyone planeable can go to the planes if they want to.<br>
<br>
&gt;False. They can go *if* they follow the rules set forth by <br>
&gt;others. They cannot go to the planes if they want to just <br>
&gt;get a group of 6 people together to go. They cannot just <br>
&gt;get their guild together and go whenever they want to if <br>
&gt;they have not also posted on the calendar for that day.<br>
<br>
Right.  So anyone can go to the planes if they want to.  Like I said.  The only restriction is that they have to abide by the same rules everyone else does.  <br>
<br>
Or are the camping rules in Lower Guk unfair because you have to go in and sit on your butt for 12 hours waiting for a FG camp spot to open up?  I think that's totally unfair.  I should be able to waltz my group down and start camping mobs when I want without having to get on a 'list'.<br>
<br>
But that's the way the player-created agreements work in that zone.  Unless you want to talk about going PnP or whatnot.  And before you say &quot;That's the system I want in the planes&quot; i ask you to remember that in EQ one size does NOT fit all.  But in both cases, they are player made and player enforced agreements.<br>
<br>
&gt;| To argue that the calendar is a system that provides for<br>
&gt;| monopolization of spawns or excludes others because<br>
&gt;| they were not there first is to argue from false<br>
&gt;| premises.<br>
<br>
&gt; False, sort of. The calendar system does provide for<br>
&gt; monopolization of spawns by guilds that are able <br>
&gt; to 'break' into a plane. <br>
<br>
I see it as the opposite.  I see the calendar as a way for those who are not connected to the right people or in a guild (or in a small one) to come up to the planes on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
No, you don't get to arrange and run the raid.  But if you were going to do that, couldn't you arrange yourself an alliance of regulars, and then you'd be a posting entity.<br>
<br>
The system works, it is fair, and it gives everyone who is willing to do a little bit of work a reasonable shot at doing the planes and planar armor.<br>
<br>
The fact that people have to follow the rules doesn't mean it's automatically somehow 'unfair'.  That's just silliness.<br>

 If you tell me you dont have 40 people, can you also tell me you dont have Any friends in Any posting alliance that you cant go to the planes? heh, come on, get real for a few and think about what you're saying.</font><P><table width="50%" border="0">

Uh... HELLO!?!?  If you believe this then you think the United States, Great Britain, France, Japan etc... are communists.  People vote on issues every day, vote on people to vote for them and vote on what they want to pass or fail.  The MAJORITY of these votes decide what happens, and in the due process of law peoples toes do get steped on.<br>
<br>
You are asking for a communist run calender, a few people being in complete control.  You, a guild of 6 planeable members are demanding we lower our requirements, 6 dicating that say 1500 or so people are wrong.<br>
<br>
Sorry man, but now you are just grasping at straws.  You didn't pay any attention to my post where I SHOWED you the diffrences in numbers and what droping the requirments would do, typing out for you what everysingle person here has been trying to tell you.<br>
<br>
You don't want to be helpful you want to make trouble and BITCH.<br>
<br>
You said you fought for the United States as a soldier right?  Not that that has any effect on what people will think of you here, it does make me wounder why you would actualy want a communist run system.  Such a system would work if the people in control were fair and indiffrent, but that isn't very likely.  So it comes down to a vote, and in such a vote the majority wins.  And in this case it is VERY simple to go along with the majority, because it makes since and is quite fair.</font><P>Zachton Soulstriker <br>55 Templar of Karana <br> Xach Soulstriker <br> 25 Ranger of Karana <br> Zachrot <br> 20 Paladin of Brell <br> Master of life for Requiem of Souls of the Rathe.<P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucleptgiantstrides.showPublicProfile?language=EN>clept giantstrides</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Wog</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>posts: </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>36</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>11/30/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>12:46:23 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif">&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: hey gumy</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">actually zach in your inability to grasp the concept of an example im reffering to, with as many communists as there is in the world if numbers made things right we would be communists because china has the worlds largest population .. guess i shoulda used dogs and cats for ya then i coulda been an animal something right<br>

-- hehe are you kidding? do you understand what was happening BEFORE these talks came about? seriously. We didnt screw up a good thing, verant did by allowing these servers to become as overcrowded as they are. You cant see that? or are you looking for someone to target false accusations at. That post right there lost all respect i had for any of the posts you made, You cant seem to understand wtf picking the lesser of two evils is, OR what a compromise. <br>
 Having 30 planeable toons to post an entity was shot down earlier in these talks because it wouldnt have done what was needed to get done. IF you had been reading and following a along you'd have noticed that.<br>
<br>
 &quot;ya never heard of me before ya made the rules, take a guess .. how many others havent ya heard of yet?<br>

 -- ooook rofl, you seem to think there's all these people backing you on feeling oppressed. Seems you think you're gonna start some kinda revolt vrs the vast majority of the server. Think of it this way, all these people you claim to have that you're voicing &quot;your&quot; opinion of, must not be above the number 40, if it was, you'd have done made a posting entity and go to the planes like everyone else.<br>
<br>
 the &quot; you will soon &quot; part, seems to be some kinda threat, wanna explain that remark? Seems to me you dont have an answer for any of my replies to you clept. Get over yourself and realize that some people like acting like adults and work things out.<br>

My husband, myself, and 6-9 other friends decide to go to the plane of fear.  We go and do small pulls and have a good time.  We leave.  Next day I am jumped because we screwed up someone elses repop.  <br>
<br>
Is this fair?  Am I not allowed to go to any zone in which I chose to go?  Am I not allowed to camp something if it isn't camped?  Is this not what PnP means?  If I don't have to check with verant why should I check with you?  Why jump me for doing something very very very legal in this game?  <br>
<br>
If you are going to do this why not ask verant to give you the key to these zones and then you will have utter control.<br>

This may sound rough but what you are telling me is A) I need 40+ people to get my name on your calender  B) I need to check with you before going  C)  I should make sure to have the BB name of the day......<br>

I would like to take a moment to say thank you to all those that put in so much time and effert on the old Calendar. I never knew who you were or what you did. I was just told a date a time, but I got to exprience Fear, and Hate from a totally newbie prespective. First raid Cazic was up, hard insert, took 14 hours and stuff was re-popping on us before we got to the gorgons. We got to evolve as a group, we learned. We came back, we got better. We have killed Cazic now, and although it is no big deal to many any more, it was an awesome day for us.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the hard work you put in in the past so that Fear could be like that for me. That day goes down as one of my favorite eq memories ever.<br>

It allows the latecomers to the party (like me) a chance to experience the zone almost like it was the first time (But with a lot fewer deaths).<br>
<br>
I just hope that those who have gotten to level 46 without knowing the calendar existed (although I don't see how you can) can be given some slack to learn the system and go on raids.<br>
<br>
It sounds like someone who didn't know any better went up to fear like it was a normal zone and acted accordingly.  Then they were upset when they got jumped on the next day for being a 'repop farmer'.<br>
<br>
No one person or guild runs the calendar system.  We all are responsible for it, and well help to maintain it.  It is a group effort by people in and out of guilds, from big evil monster guilds OF DEATH (like mine) to some of the small, friendly almost social-only guilds like KEG or CIW.<br>
<br>
If I was in a posting entity or had the ability, I would even be willing to invite you on a raid so you could understand why so many of us like this calendar system.<br>
<br>
But I don't have that ability.  I'm just like you when it comes to having the 'power' to schedule a raid.  But I've chosen to take the hassle of having to get invited to raids over the hassle of organizing and maintaining an alliance.<br>

But you also can't leave those who don't believe the calendar isn't a good system out of it.<br>
<br>
Everyone that's been to Fear loves going there when it's just you and your buddies, you can fart around all day or kill the entire zone, it's up to you.  People that haven't been to a Plane yet don't understand what it's like.  There are HUGE agro ranges on most of the mobs, some summon you, then you have to deal with Cazic's Death touches on top of everything else.  It's really strange when your fighting next to your buddy who has full health then Cazic decides to murder them.  It's really freaky and it takes a while to get used to.<br>
<br>
Things like this can't be read about without actually going there and feeling your pulse rush as you start whacking on Mob's that are 3 times your size.  These are experiances that everyone should have right to feel.  I'm a firm believer that we can have a calendar that works for everyone once people understand that it means that what is involved in going to an Altered plane.  <br>
<br>
I hope that this system still has enough steam left in it to function like it's supposed to.  The only thing I fear is when large organizations try to set rule's and limits on zones that no one owns or has any right to control.  If someone wants to run the calendar then it should be done as fair and just, as possable.  Inserting rules that make a group call a big guild to kill a god is unessesary and only promotes anger (as far as I'm concerned).  If you want to put a limit on how many people is needed to be able to use the calendar then make it a managable limit, 20 sounds good to me.<br>
<br>
There are alot of people that play EQ more casual than others.  They don't know many people because they don't spend that much time online.  These people pay there monthy bill to Verant like the rest of us and should have an opertunity to go into any zone they wish.  I have a sugestion for those that don't know alot of people and want to experiance a plane.  Set up a tread on this site where people can post that want to go with others into a plane, that way we can meet a certain &quot;player&quot; limit and those people can see what they've been reading about on a more casual basis.  It's just an idea, but with cooperation it might work.  Simply excluding certain people or groups of people isn't want this game is about (according to me).  This way those sick Uber guilds can go into fear and kill cazic (if he's up) all they want so they can be the first on there block to get there FA item.<br>
<br>
But the principle behind the calendar is good and I for one am all for keeping it alive. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> </font><P>Gumy Bare

It says nothing about you must be a guild.  40 friends can become an entity, as long as they aren't in another entity already.  You don't nee 40 to clear a plane, you need 40 to be a posting entity.  This gives anyone who wants to go to a Plane the chance to go.  This means less posting entities, and more chances for said entities to do Plane Raids.<br>
<br>
&gt; Epic Guilds (BB Guilds) are ONLY called in if the Raiding Entity can't take down the God.  The Epic Guild will then *only* take the Epic Weapon Item that the God is holding, if any, and that's all they're entitled to.  If the Raiding Entity can take down the God, it's theirs.  If they can take down the God, more than likely they have people who are doing their Epic Weapon Quests, also.<br>
<br>
&gt; You can 'fart around' if you choose.  Um, no.  Only if the Plane is already empty.  If it is popped, you will surely die 'farting around'. If that is your wish, tho, go for it.<br>
