Your being in the zone can cause the guild to wipe due to the incredibly bad aggro; additionally, you will likely die, and still hold up the event as you disrupt the script. The event then has to reset, instead of being able to continue forward. That means that you, and whoever is with you, will be responcible completely for ruining a night worth of work for a guild, as the reset times are often prohibitively long. <br>
<br>
I'll say this very clearly: The mobs can warp, not despawn when they should, or not reset when they should, due to the actions of people in the zone; if you are not on the raid, you are part of the problem. <br>
<br>
As with any conventions on the Rathe, they are designed to work for everyone; the guild who you leave a plane for on monday may well be those who have to leave when you attempt the script the next week.<br>
<br>
But make no mistake; if a raid leader asks you to leave a zone because of your potential to ruin the script and cause their raid to fail, you are lower than pond scum if you refuse. The time and enjoyment of 50+ people are not subservient to your group of 6's xp in a plane that basically cannot function as an XP zone after the script begins. It is also a PnP rule, regarding quest interferance, that if you potentially will disrupt a quest or event like this, you have to leave. Here's the notice for those who respect the conventions of the RTA: Being in a zone during a scripted event will, more than potentially, will probably disrupt a quest or event. <br>
<br>
Since guilds have been entering the zone, it is custom for those on raids to take precidence over those getting xp; as it should be, since the organization and time put in to get 50 people to a zone is much greater than the problem with moving a group to a new zone for xp. <br>
<br>
Be a human being, and get out if you are asked. <br>

How about attacking a mob like Doom (not that he's really that tough) upon the pull from outside the raid? If a guild is raiding, it should be fairly obvious that you are not welcome.

<br>
When TL killed RZ, other guilds (ourselves included) followed the same acts, and left TL alone to deal with RZ and the script.<br>
<br>
It's a standard.  We did not ask TL/NB to leave on out kills out of vanity or out of pride.  We asked them to leave because SoE cannot to this day manufacture a bug-free scripted event, sadly.  Being the standard, every guild henseforth has had the convenience of dealing with a fruity script w/o the chance for outside interfearance due to bugs in the script.<br>
<br>
I'm contributing to this thread not to make demands or threats, but rather to ask people to please be considerate and set aside you're ~45 minutes or so of grp exp in PoTac for guilds performing the RZ script.<br>
<br>
Trust me, you will be here one day -- wouldnt you like it to be the unspoken law of the land - that when a guild does the RZ script, people will clear out while you work through it?  I know i would.<br>

<br>
Some of those people who aren't in some big guild are just there to hang out for a bit, and that's all they have time to do.<br>
<br>
So, you come in with your group of 50, and ask them to leave, which is perfectly fine considering the potential for disruption, but they leave their group breaks up and all of a sudden their play time is over having accomplished nothing beyond being a good neighbor to you, and getting nothing out of it.<br>
<br>
Why don't you offer them something in return for leaving the zone? I don't think it would be too difficult for 50+ people to come up with something to compensate those 6 with for giving up their time for your guild whom they owe nothing to and have no ties with.<br>
<br>
Not everyone is in a guild, just because you are doesn't mean you have dominion over those that aren't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bogfatherbellybarsh>Bogfather Bellybarsh</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.mmmonkeybusiness.com/jesterav.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>For the last time, I came back!</span><br>  Posts: 1585<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/30/03 8:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mmmonkeybusiness.com/jesterav.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> This is a great topic...recently on SH we had issues with someone parked with us in the bertox script.

<br>
Last night while NB was doing the RZ event Tallon Zek I believe agroed someone 2 floors down and across the zone when he spawned, ran to the zone killed the group then fucked the NB raid.<br>
<br>
I dont think NB or anyone else should compensate a group to leave a zone when a zone wide scripted event is going on.<br>
<br>
For one as of what happened last night proves the zone is funkity. For two When RZ spawns the XP mobs depop, the Arena depops, RZ pops in the center, guess what happends to a group xping either around near or in the arena? Yep you guessed it they get a Fire Axe shoved up there ass =).<br>
<br>
It comes down to common courtesy, everything on the Rathe is built on working together to not step on toes, we dont compensate the groups of xpr's loose all thier XP mobs when 10th Ring war completely depops the zone like Tactics does. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://bellsouthpwp.net/v/i/vincecrs/vincesig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>

&quot;For one as of what happened last night proves the zone is funkity&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;funkity&quot; has to be the coolest word I've seen in months. Congrats.<br>
<br>
Now, to the actual reply.<br>
<br>
Vince, you are absolutly 100% correct. It's just that not everyone sees it the same way, if they did the incident would not have ahppened in the first place. My suggestion of offering compensation before hand, for them to leave was not saying they are right and you are wrong, it is however a solution that should convince those who see it differently to move on out until the event is done.<br>
<br>
Example: I am a stubborn pain in the ass, Vince says Grulagan get out so I can do this thangie all the mobs gonna be gone anyways. My stubborn alarm goes off and I immediatly say &quot;Fuck you Vince it's a free zone&quot;. Bla bla time goes by and I end up screwing your attempt up.<br>
<br>
Now, what if it went down this way. &quot;Vince: Grulagan get out so I can do this thangie&quot;. &quot;Me: Fuck you vince it's a free zone&quot;. &quot;VInce: ok, I see you are a pain in the ass how about if you stay out until I am done I give you a cookie?&quot; &quot;Me:Oreo?&quot; &quot;Vince:Sure man whatever you want just GTFO til I am done&quot; &quot;Me:Ok cool I want double stuff!&quot;<br>
<br>
Just would have been a better scene for you is all I am saying, it's a solution that although you may not want to do it out of principal, achieves the desired outcome. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mongomfh>mongo mfh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/30/03 10:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re</span><hr size=1> And then about 50 kids also want an oreo for nothing more than not being a dick.

You might want to be a little more specific Rogg, there are a ton of scripted events that this rule shouldn't apply.  Examples: frog or bee events in PoS, Vulak in ToV, the variety of events in Ssra, AD in PoV, trials in PoJ . . . you get the point.  <br>

Rallos Zek Script, Stay outta tatics unless ya wana be randomly ported to some REALLY bad place in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Sol Ro, one hour repop on mobs there, Raids in there pretty much eliminate the XP mobs so no point in going if you are flagged.<br>
<br>
Terris Thule, PoNb isn't much of an XP spot from what i heard anyway, so not many would bother to go there.<br>
<br>
Sayrin - Unsure how this event effects the zone, We were running script one night and people came in and left when askked.<br>
<br>
Grummis, does not effect the zone at all<br>
<br>
HoH Trials  3 large areas are needed for the trials and takes out a number of XP mobs, unsure on the rest of the zone, but should vacate for Trials.<br>
<br>
HoHb Mithanel Marr, crappy ass XP zone so no one bothers, non issue<br>
<br>
BoT Aangar, Event does not effect the zone, no need to vacate.<br>
<br>
Vallon/Tallon as their own scripts, I am unsure as to how it effects the zone but people vacated for us generally.<br>
<br>
What mob/events did i miss?  What did i get wrong?<br>
<br>
One problem i see here is those who play on our server and do not read this.  I ran into someone who is unguilded sitting at the zone waiting for her corpse that was dead in the pit because they were (chanter) soloing there and got hit by an arrow... this after karadin did warn the zone many times we were running RZ script.<br>

Emil is 100% correct on what the compensation is and yes, interfearing with these events is a bannable offence per SoE.<br>

<br>
Pin the blame squarely on Verrant.  Scripted events should allow the participants to spawn into their own "copy" of the zone -- with all the same MOBs, all the same loot tables, etc.  There's no reason why your 50+ raid force should disrupt the play and enjoyment of those small groups of players who are XPing in the zone.  What if it's not one group?  What if all the planets of the universe aligned, and it just so happened that there were TEN other groups in the zone, all XPing.  You're 50+ raid force can boot out 60 other players, just because it wants to  run a scripted event?<br>
<br>
Yeah, Shantar, there is a reason.  This is a Play Nice Policy rule, we're a PNP server.<br>
<br>
It's true, the Rathe is probably the best server I've ever seen with respect to how it manages MOB rotations, zone reservations, etc.  But there's nothing nice about telling 6 or 60+ players they have to leave the zone while your guild plays around in it for a little while.  Many of those players don't even know what a scripted event is (they're not in a raid guild, they've never even bothered to look up this stuff -- all they know is this is a good place for XP, and they've been hunting here for 2 hours).  To them, you're just some anonymous_obnoxious_guild03 disrupting their night of fun.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying a disagree with Roggulbok's post -- but I'm open-minded enough to see that there are two sides to this claiming of the zone. <p><BR><img src=http://avengersinfaith.lfchosting.com/images/signatures/ShantarSig1.jpg height=189 width=408></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shantar>Shantar</A> at: 5/30/03 4:24:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=emilsinclair>Emil Sinclair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GL-BoTS</span><br>  Posts: 417<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(5/30/03 5:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm50.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Regarding Scripted Events and the like...</span><hr size=1> tactics wont support 10 grps really.<br>
<br>
and, from the argument you are offering --<br>
<br>
you can get exp in pon, postorm, bot, valor, hoh, cod, inno, or tac - any time, for as long as you like (meaning you can pop on, and kill 3 mobs, then log out - or you can log in and kill exp mobs for 14 hours if you want).  You can get exp solo, with a grp, or hell you can make a /raid of 60 and get exp anywhere, any time.<br>
<br>
the difference is with a scripted event, like RZ or bert, or cod upper event - you cannot get each respective planar projection to spawn, unless you complete that particular script, you cannot leave the start or leave the script whever you want to (unless you don't want to beat it), you cannot do this w/o a set number of people ( lets say 60, more or less).<br>
<br>
Exp'ing is a 'never ending process' (well until you max your AA), flagging ends (once all are flagged).<br>
<br>
There are many, many differences weighing the 'importance level' of running a scripted event VS experienceing.  I have made the comparisons above.  It's also GM enforced (interfeering with a quest, the flags are loosely quests to progress).<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, this isnt necessarily an RTA rule, it's more of an RTA request for courtesy.  The favor will be returned for you when you are faced with these challenges.<br>

Trials in PoJ are one group at a time, no way to interfear with them.<br>
<br>
Frog and Bee events in PoStorms, thro some detales on how they work, is the Bee you refer to the L70 nammed Bee? if it is, the one time we did it, it was a simple raid of 4 groups and a small cleric CH rot, should follow general raid rules, it is being engaged, respect the area.<br>
<br>
SSRA events?  There are no &quot;events&quot; as such that are scripred apart from the E/G/C and there are specific rules regarding this rotatation.  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm52.showMessage?topicID=13.topic">pub6.ezboard.com/ftherath...D=13.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
The rest are simply nammed mobs which are far enough apart that, generally, one raid won't interfear too much with another raid at the same time.<br>

Vyxn, How did this topic not start off well?  Rogg made a good post, which has been expanded upon since.  I am unsure as to what discussion you feel is still needed really?  It is a simple curtosy to take out an XP group from a plane when a &quot;scripted&quot; event is running, and most likely a wise choice as interfering is bannable.<br>

The script itself breaks every one of those rules you just quoted, and is a fine example of how out of touch SoE is with thier own game. The fact that SoE cannot to this day manufacture a bug-free scripted event should come as no shock to anyone, but the RZ events bugginess is above and beyond stupid.  You know it I know it but many people are unaware of it.  That is why it needs to be discussed.<br>
<br>
***note to self- Post about the RZ script on TWC message board.*** <br>
<br>
 I personally have no problem leaving the zone, a matter of fact if the script is going I actually do not want to be in the zone anyways.  Generally the first thing I do when I enter tactics is a /w if I see a boatload of one guild I know to just run down the stairs and click.  If I have been grinding in tactics for a few hours I'm probably not clicking /w all that often.  It now becomes the raiding guilds responsability to make sure I am aware that they are going to start the RZ script.  Keep in mind sometimes this takes more than one /OOC message <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Guilds doing the RZ script would probably be smart to assign someone who types fast to do /w often and communicate with others as they zone in. <br>
<br>
 The problem is SoE's script not players, be they raiders,grinders or just someone looking to explore new places none of them are breaking rules.  Its SoE breaking all the PnP rules not any of us. All we can do is try to make the best of this stupid script and inform as many people as possible.<br>
