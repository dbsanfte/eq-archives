I put fourth that they would not be their today if that “Moron” President Bush had not threaten military action against Sadam Hussein. If the Euro politico’s had continued to appease Iraq and politely ask Sadam to let the inspectors monitor Iraqi weapons (as Sadam had agreed to do in the peace treaty he signed after losing a war of aggression against Kuwait) the inspection teams would still be waiting around outside of Iraq.<br>
<br>
Sadam has apparently submitted his list of banned weapons programs… he says he has absolutely none but has submitted a several thousand-page diatribe in Arabic that will take weeks if not months to translate and digest. I believe he is lying and consciously in breach of the treaties he agreed to.<br>
<br>
What in your minds would justify the US crushing Sadam like the bug he is? Is their anything short of a nuke or chemical weapon obliterating a million people that would make some of the more liberal posters think it’s time for Sadam to take a permanent dirt nap?<br>

Do you believe Sadam poses no threat? Perhaps you think Uncle Sadam is an enlighten benevolent ruler who cares deeply for his people. And the big bad old US has maligned this saint incarnate to feed it's own nefarious needs for oil. For that matter do you really think Sadam is only a threat to the US?<br>

Taxes are to high, government makes plenty of mistakes, and the President handles many issues very poorly. However this thread is talking about Sadam and the threat he poses. <br>
<br>
Discussions are usually about one thing at a time. It’s just not possible to talk about every issue at once. I know it's hard but try to focus on one issue at a time. If you want to post about taxes, or the President feel free.<br>
<br>
Do you think if we ignore Iraq, stick our heads in the sand and call him and his generals beggars and cowards the threat will just go away? It’s to bad you can’t give your nephews and nieces all the presents you want, but at least they aren’t sucking mustard gas or glowing in the dark this year.<br>

I tend to do this because I see a lot of connections between events.  Kinda like everyone knows Kevin Beacon through 6 people or something like that.  On the issue at hand of the threat of Saddam:<br>
<br>
1) Iraq's defense budget is about 1 billion.  Compare this our nearly 300 billion defense spending (not including &quot;special&quot; appropriations)<br>
<br>
2) Saddam leads a secular (not religion based) government.  Kind are mostly (if not completely) rooted in religious factors.  Hence the reason we helped Saddam get into power in the first place.<br>
<br>
3) UN inspectors that where in the country until 4 years ago claimed to dismantle a majority of Saddams war machine.  <br>
<br>
4) If someone or something of value (ie nuclear scientist or a bomb) was still in Iraq after all this talk of attacks, then they are too stupid to get out of the way of a bulldozer, let alone get into our country.<br>
<br>
The US has never attacked a country pre-emptively.  Why? Because this country is built on freedom and tolerance.  Do I want a dirty bomb to detonate somewhere in downtown Manhattan?  Of course not.  Do I think if we invade a predominately Muslim country with out direct provocation from them will lead hundreds of thousands to join a terrorist group targeting the US?  ABSOFUCKINGLUTLY!  I don't want our country to go looking for trouble because we will find it.  We should be playing DEFENSE.  Defense wins games.  Defense wins the superbowl.  Defense keeps this country strong and an example for the rest to follow.  My comment about Israel is to point out the offense is flashy and makes the news but doesn't win the game.  Sure, everyone loves to score lots of points, but ... UGG sorry- off on another tangent <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ok in conclusion:<br>
<br>
We will be doing more harm by inflaming an entire region of religious fanatics against us.  Something in the sand breeds discontent people.  Maybe it's the oil or maybe those camel spiders but either case, we don't need either one.  Any questions? <p>Eziekial<br>

Exactly how did you find out Iraq’s annual defense budget? And how is comparing Iraq’s defense budget to that of the US of any relevance whatsoever?<br>
<br>
2.) Sadam is an absolute dictator, not the leader of a secular government. But once again… relevance?<br>
<br>
3.) It was never the job of UN inspectors to “Dismantle” the Iraqi war machine. Gen. Schwartzkoph (sp?) pretty much took care of that. In accordance with the treaty Sadam agreed to at the end the Gulf War it was Sadam’s responsibility to dismantle his war machine, specifically weapons of mass destruction research programs. The inspectors were to have total access to anyplace in Iraq to ensure he did as he said.<br>
<br>
Iraq bared the inspector’s access to many places. They gave an incomplete list of all their WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) resources, and whenever the inspectors discovered anything un-accounted for the Iraqi’s said “Oops, silly us we forgot that stuff.” and gave out a new list. Ultimately the accused the inspectors of being American/Israeli spies and expelled all the inspectors from Iraq. I believe at that point we should have crushed Sadam, however Clinton was in office and he opted for economic sanctions instead… they haven’t worked.<br>
<br>
4.) I don’t think Sadam is stupid, just a megalomaniacal egocentric dictator.<br>
<br>
I don’t believe this is “Pre-emptive” war to begin with. Sadam attacked another country. He lost. As a term of his surrender he forfeit his ability to pursue an offensive military force. If he breaches the peace treaty the result is a resumption of hostilities.<br>
<br>
Sure, the Middle East has a larger than average share of fanatics, zealots, and generally discontent people. But I don’t believe fear of what those people might do justifies ignoring the very real and demonstrated threat to global stability that Sadam is.<br>

I'm sure you can look it up if you doubt it's validity.  The relevance comes from the fact that it takes a lot of money to make weapons.  Claims that people can manufacture a dirty bomb with $5,000 and a few household chemicals have seen one to many &quot;MacGyver&quot; episodes.   Millions of dollars and very, very rare components (like the enriched uranium) make it difficult to produce.  Saddam also has to pay for upkeep of the armed forces including payroll so this leaves him with little to spend on &quot;research&quot;<br>
<br>
2) Not going to bother explaining this to you.  figure it out yourself.<br>
<br>
3) a) I didn't mean to say they did it, oversaw is the right term, sorry.  b) You are right, our military kicked their (Iraq's army) asses outta Kuwait.  Saddam signed a UN treaty.  He did not attack the US.  c) He attacked Kuwait.  Kuwait should be the ones pushing the UN to resolve the breech of treaties.  d) He did accuse the inspectors of being spies.  Clinton ordered the inspectors out to protect them.  One of the inspectors was on TV a few months ago, can't remember his name but he basically said: I was working with agents who where spying for the US.  They even had some cool spy communication stuff.  <br>
<br>
Not that I remember, but when Iraq attacked Kuwait, I really didn't fear for my life.  I really don't think many Americans did either.  That was at a point where he had a HUGE military and all kinds of weapons.  Now, after getting sanctioned and continuously bombed by the US he is more of a threat?  I don't buy it.  He's just an easily deamonized target to focus on to get the US citizens to forget about the true threat. <p>Eziekial<br>

Hrmn.. Someone hasn't turned on the TV for a few years have they? This has already happened. So quit worrying about it. And since this has already happened, what do you suppose the world does?<br>
<br>
1. Ignore the terrorists and other anti-groups hoping they'll go away.<br>
<br>
2. Try and say we're sorry that we didn't mean to give Kuiwaits freedom back from a tyrant.<br>
<br>
3. Tell the Palestinians that they should just go on letting their people blow themselves to bits. It really is a great way to get a point across.<br>
<br>
4. Stomp the crap out of anything willing to harm innocent people over ignorant ideas.<br>
<br>
I also find it amusing that in Pakestan the #1 toy that is selling for upwards of $400 US is an Osama Bin Laden action figure. Osama, has become the thing he hates most. A corporate figurehead sellout. Must be nice hating all the USA people for living in their lavish homes with their vile electronics and wealth when he himself is what Nike is to the USA. Maybe he'll blow his brains out in disgust.<br>

Sure we will have no problem desposing of saddam, but im pretty sure he knows that too, and in order to match odds some, he will probably fight dirty. Yes he probably has facilities and weapons we dont know about, hell most nations have their own little dirty secrets, the US does. I mean Kissinger getting appointed to the independent commity in charge of sep 11th investigations is ridiculous, this is the guy that organized bomb raids against against cambodia, and was linked to sponsoring the assasinations of several political leaders in south America. He is wanted for questioning for war crimes in France, spain, and Argentina i believe. Yes Saddam is a dictator, he opresses his people and does some evil @#%$. But so what? He hasnt done anything to the US yet. Our so called &quot;war on terror&quot; is only fanning the flames.<br>
<br>
Sure there havent been any recent attacks since the sep 11th frenzy, and guess what we're getting over confident again, i just pray to god that the next attack doesn't come anywhere near where i live.<br>
<br>
We think we're somehow exempt from the problems of other countries, sure France, Germany, and England suffer terrorist attacks on a yearly basis, but who cares about them, how dare they attack the US OF A!!! I mean the nerve! After we've invaded their countries, trained their secret police in the arts of torture, overthrew their democratically elected leaders, put dictators in place (the Shah of Iran, Saddam, to name a few). I mean those  ungrateful bastards attacking us.<br>
<br>
And Saddam, that devil of a man, sitting in his many pallaces, supposedly making weapons of mass destruction, while Iran, India, Pakistan, North Korea, China, have all actually developed weapons of mass destruction.<br>
<br>
Honestly, why dont we lets say go to war with India, or China?<br>
<br>
I dont really give a @#%$ kill Saddam for all i care, not a single thing we say on here can make a bit of difference, no matter the outcome of the UN inspectors, hell they can sweep the whole damn country, and not find anything pres Bush has 'RESERVED' the right to attack Iraq anyways.<br>
<br>
And thus we further thrust our image of gun totting trigger happy cowboys to the rest of the world, and everyone will hate us just a little bit more. <br>

After all we don’t want the Eurocrats to think poorly of us.<br>
<br>
I disagree. Socialist intellectuals in the old world have always scorned America, and they always will regardless of our actions. The point to squashing Sadam is this. He has openly violated the peace treaty he agreed to after we kicked his ass last time. If we let it slide because we’re worried about our public image why should anyone else ever abide by any agreements made with the US? The European of political policy of the appeasement of tyrants has a very poor track record; in fact it has never prevented war or nurtured peace. It has only emboldened the actions of tyrants and despots throughout history. <br>
<br>
In the old days we could wait around and hope for the best. After all if war broke out armies could be raised, troops transported, trenches dug. Wars took a long time and great effort. In the modern world the luxury of “Wait and see” has a much higher price tag. Weapons of Mass Destruction have changed the equation that is war. In the modern equation two factors must dictate the need for war: 1.) Possession of WMD resources and 2.) An unstable aggressive governing body.<br>
<br>
You’re right China, India, Pakistan, Iran, N.Korea all have half the equation and need to be watched vigilantly. No truer words were ever spoken than those of a British Statesman:<br>

BUT! We shouldn't play favorites. Why do we pick on Saddam, and not other nations whom we know have illegally obtained weapons of mass destruction? Thats why a large part of the world doesn't like us. Because we only serve our own interests when we commit our troops. I was born, and lived in Europe for a large part of my life, i still visit there once a year, I've also lived in Canada for about 5 years, and the US for the last 4 years. Ive had a chance to see different views on international politics. <br>
<br>
People dont like America, because they see US as a selfish, self serving nation, which is run by hypocrisy. If we said we were going to disarm all the nations which have obtained illegal weapons, ie chemical/nuclear, that would be fine, we are actually enforcing the international laws. But we have been picking on Iraq for over 10 years, and havent really done anything about the countries which we KNOW have developed these technologies. Why dont we go after them? Wow Iraq has terrorists hiding out within its borders. <br>
<br>
There are terrorists in almost every damn country on Earth, if we wanted to stop terror attacks, why dont we go against the IRA? They are also a terrorist association, why dont we go bomb and invade Ireland?<br>
<br>
Or why dont we help the Russians with Chechnya if we want their help in Iraq etc.<br>
