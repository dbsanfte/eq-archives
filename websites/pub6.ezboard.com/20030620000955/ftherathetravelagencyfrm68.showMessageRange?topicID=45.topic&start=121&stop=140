<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Or if you really think about it.. the ability to follow orders from your commander without thinking about the consequences, but after dissimenating his or her orders and finding they are logical.. well then that's fine.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes, you just confirmed for me from that statement that you have never been in the military or even have the slightest clue about how it works. What you just said is the furthest thing from the truth. Let me explain it to you so that you understand before you keep putting your foot in your mouth and make yourself look like one of Jerry's kids. As I said before at least Karadin attempts to research the information before speaking and he attempts to think things logically, you should learn from him. <br>
<br>
People in the US military take the following oath when enlisting. <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->. So help me God. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Notice a little key in this statement? Well maybe you should go read the regulations and UCMJ. <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.military-network.com/main_ucmj/SUBCHAPTERX.html#892.92">www.military-network.com/...tml#892.92</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Here is the key point you should understand from there.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>892. ART. 92. FAILURE TO OBEY ORDER OR REGULATION<br>
<br>
 Any person subject to this chapter who--<br>
<br>
(1) <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->; <br>
<br>
(2) having knowledge of any other lawful order issued by any member of the armed forces, which it is his duty to obey, fails to obey the order; or <br>
<br>
(3) is derelict in the performance of his duties; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There main word in this statement, LAWFUL. No people in the military are not mindless machines that blindly follow orders. If an officer or NCO order you to shoot a civilian who is not a threat <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>you</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> would be court-martial for following an unlawful order</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->. <br>
<br>
As both a senior NCO and Officer in the military I would always sit down and explain to the people under me the reason every time I gave an order in peace time or when possible. There are 2 main reasons for this.<br>
<br>
1. So the people under me understand why they are doing something. People in the US military do not blindly follow orders, but instead are explained why something is happening, why the order is being given and what others in the unit are doing also. Ignorant soldiers are the worst enemy in a battle. This also gives my troops confidence in me about my orders, so when we do get into a combat situation order are given quickly and followed quickly with the understand of the logic of them. This gives my troops confidence in me to make the correct decisions.<br>
<br>
2. To understand the commanders intent. On the battle field things can change very quickly and even the lowest ranking NCO is expected to be able to make battle field decisions. The key to making these changes is that you are following the intent of the plan given by your commander so that the complete plan moves forward. For that you must have a clear understanding of the orders given to you. <br>
<br>
Basically I think someone else said it here, but you just seem to like to shoot shit out of your mouth with no logic, thinking or facts to back up the statements. If you want to keep acting like some stupid hillbilly with a 2nd grade education that married his sister please go right ahead. <br>
<br>
I am proud to have served in the military and back our people up 100%. If you want to have an intelligent conversation and debate the real issues please back up your statements. Do a little research before opening your mouth and stop making yourself look so stupid.  <br>

I wasn't saying that at all.  In fact,  was trying to express closer to what Rogg did.<br>
<br>
I WAS saying that CNN has less credibility than other news broadcasters, because of their political spin.  I happen to adore Fox, so I was definately not talking about them.<br>
<br>
Another thing:  I wasn't addressing this war really.  I was thinking of other stories where they actually do not get the facts first.  Obviously imbedded reporters giving first hand news is pretty juicy stuff.<br>
<br>
Oh and...<br>

This is not the US or any one nation doing this war, but the UN that I thought I made clear in my post. The US is acting on the UN's behalf right now and leading the way just like they did in 1991. This is 100% a UN function with 31 coalition members now, although the Whitehouse is claim there is more then even the 34 coalition members back in 1991. The problem is some member nations of the UN themselves don't seem to understand this themselves. <br>

The issue France and other nations against the war right now is they have issues following the UN resolutions that have already been pasted. France and these other nations approved these resolutions, but did not have the willingness to enforce them. You can few the voting results for resolution 1441, which was passed 15-0 at:<br>

The US finally stepped up to the plate and said enough is enough, let's enforce these resolutions finally after 12 years.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=therealdrache>TheRealDrache</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A great example of...<BR>

As far as questions go, I'm still waiting on responses to my questions too...  Seems the folks so eager to speak out against the war have no alternatives to suggest - the surest sign of someone who is just going along with what they think is popular or what they think will get them laid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rejard>rejard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(3/21/03 10:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm68.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=138>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What a load of BS!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> I just wqanted to know if he thought that stuff really dissapears or not.<br>

<br>
And become mindless slaves?  So basically, we take the freedom of speech and debate from the people and call anything other than conformity treason?  Sorry we are not Iraq, we do not follow blindly our leaders based on fear of reprisals from them.<br>
<br>
I myself feel that there are diplomatic avenues yet to explore.  Yet there comes a time when these become clogged and damn near impossible to navigate, which is the case now, and some sort of action is needed.  Sadly that time has come.<br>
<br>
I we can hope for now is that this does not become WWIII.  Hopefully the coolition can get into Baghdad remove the regime, rebuild the country, and get out as soon as possible.  And hopefully the world will be better for it.  And hope some more that we will not feel the repercussions of it for years to come in the form of terrorism.<br>
<br>
And remember there is a difference in supporting the war and supporting the troops.  Lets not see this turn into another Vietnam where our troops come home to people spitting on them.  That would be an absolute shame.<br>
<br>
And Pressto... well said.<br>

I am usually short-winded and perhaps even terse. I work on technical problems so I guess that it is in my nature to be so.<br>
<br>
I got emailed an online petition to stop the war. I responded in my usual short winded, factual manner. I recieved this from that person, this is another response that they had recieved, they felt it was even better than mine. I believe this to be true. Perhaps this should be sent around. <br>
<br>
Be responsible.<br>

These petitions against the war are all a bunch of BS.  Yes, the numbers <br>
against the war are probably appoximately 20%, which means that leaves 80% <br>
wishing to get rid of the monster that's out there.  Maybe you want to wait <br>
until the next two of our buildings and 3,000 more of our civilian poplution <br>
are decimated, but I'D rather take that preemptive strike to keep that from <br>
happening.  <br>
<br>
It's GOING to happen whether we go to war or not, (they really, really hate <br>
us, by the way, always have, and always will), so I'd rather destroy what <br>
they have and make it later, rather than sooner.  <br>
<br>
There is no difference between what Saddam is doing now, to his people, and <br>
what Hitler did to the Jews and his people, in World War II.  NONE    And I <br>
suppose you and everyone else opposed to this war, feels Hitler should have <br>
kept on killing everyone then also, since he posed no immediate threat to our <br>
homeland.  The hypocrisy blows my mind.  Yet in hindsight we mutter, we can't <br>
ever let this happen again, yet we do.<br>
<br>
The fact is, France, has been steadfastly sticking by their buddy <br>
Saddam....why??  Because they know this war IS  about oil, and the fact <br>
they've been having it practically GIVEN to them. WHY??  What is Iraq getting <br>
in return...hmmm.  When we go in, we'll find out, and exactly how many things <br>
have "Made in France" on them that can be used against us someday.  I wish <br>
the die hard anti-capitalist, anti-corporate liberals out there would put <br>
just a fraction of their ire on the foreign corporations that sell out their <br>
countries and people to further their agendas at the expense of the American <br>
people.<br>
<br>
As Americans, we know who we are and what we stand for, and to paint these <br>
pictures of us as something other is very disingenuine, and very, very <br>
harmful in the long run.<br>
<br>
I fully support our President, our troops, and the goodness of the American <br>
people as a whole, and am proud of the fact that God has watched over us, as <br>
good people, and the shining beacon in the world we really are.  And as <br>
thousands of people MAY die, we can take heart in that fact that we will no <br>
longer stand around silently, while Saddam kills, tortures, and destroys, <br>
another million of his own people.<br>
<br>
You can send this off to the UN also, or you can choose to delete it, but if <br>
you choose to delete it, I ask YOU to pass it on.<br>
