The name is Niyara, that's N-I-Y-A-R-A.  If you expect me to show you courtesy by reading your post and responding in a mature fashion, I highly suggest you treat me with respect as well.<br>
<br>
No, I'm not a member of one of the "Big 10" Guilds...  I have no desire to be.  But unlike the opinions expressed here by several people (yourself included), my guild should not be penalized for that.  <br>
<br>
Quite honestly, I think that being in a smaller guild does two things, first and foremost we have absolutely no guild politics (thank GOD).  Secondly, we make sure that EVERY member of our guild is mature, and respects other players.  You see, unlike some, we believe that a guild is responsible to it's members, but it is ALSO responsible to the server.  <br>
<br>
If we don't see eye to eye on that, no problem.  But ditch the condescending attitude please.<br>

Nyara, no disrespect meant. No condescending attitude meant either. A guild is an organization of people that devote their time to eachother, and together accomplish the more difficult things in EQ. And if you are implying the guild which I am a member of is not responsible to its members and to the server, you are wrong.<br>
 I have backed up the calendar numerous times. Deris and I (and others) have been at eachothers throats a number of times, BECAUSE he felt the calendar would just be abused and missused. I see that happening with open raids. There will always be an influx of planes capable people and guilds, no matter which server we play on, and those 10 or so guilds that can do a raid self sufficiently will grow to 11, then 12, then 13 etc. What I am saying is; those who wish to obtain items from one of the planes/uber mobs, should either be able to do it all in-guild, or be able to ask assistance/join another guild for a raid or two. Open raids are crowding an already crowded calendar. It is not doing justice to the organization the calendar provides. <br>
<br>
At this rate, the calendar will be abused more and more by these so called &quot;Open Raids&quot;, resulting in a breakdown of the calendar system. When this happens, Luclin will be thrust into a FFA system, where the only real losers will be those small guilds, or unguilded people.<br>
<br>
My views on small guilds and the number of guilds out there has nothing to do with my stance on the usefullness of the calendar.<br>
<br>
You should not be penalized for being in a small guild. But there are some things that are out of reach for those who are not in a big guild.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Alzen Adazewerk<br>

Use these open raids to your advantage!  I do agree that it's getting a bit out of hand, but if they don't take the rare spawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong with sending the raid leader and tell and asking if you can take it.  If anything, using the calendar like this should avoid the so called &quot;wasted spawns,&quot; so nyah!<br>

If an epic item was dropped it was already designated to a person.  If a person needed only one item to complete their planar gear then they got the item.<br>
<br>
It would be polite to say that you can have the epic item since you are close or that you can have the piece of armor since it is the last one you need...<br>
BUT that is not an open raid!<br>
<br>
An open raid should be just that, open to all who wish to attend.  None of the &quot;open raid for all except Calidorn or anyone else.  (hehe and no I have never been told that just an example)<br>
<br>
If an item drops then all who need it should random.  It should not be given out by the person hosting the raid as it has with some &quot;open raids&quot; because that is biased.  If someone attends then they should have the opportunity to roll for it if they need it.  Whether it be equipment or item for an epic quest.  They need epic items as much as the person who only has two items left to complete.<br>
<br>
If 1/4th of the people on the raid are of the same guild as the person who sponsored it I would have to say it would be an outcry of abuse.  Not that they do not have the right as anyone else to go on open raids but it is pretty much a sign that the open raid was designated as a way for that guild to have a greater chance of obtaining planar items.<br>
<br>
I've had friends leave open raids because the person who sponsored it set up groups and needless to say one group was the guild of the person who set it up... and was also the KS group.  The leader of the group would loot and at times would call out loot and other times another person from that group would loot after the leader did, saying that there was an item on the corpse and the leader had all slots full.  Odd that the people that looted corpses were of the class that could use the equipment if it dropped.<br>
<br>
Are open raids abused?  Yes they are.<br>
<br>
Does anyone actually do real &quot;open raids&quot;?  Yes they do<br>
<br>
The problem I see is that most people are either saying there is a problem and they need to stop it or that it is fine and leave it alone.  It's not a white/black issue but it is grey at the current moment.  Luclin has already unleashed the hordes of 50+ people.  Hell many people have two characters of plane level now.  Heck some with two level 60's.  *hug papazol*  (Any man who can remove his visible armor and solo the entrance of Sebilis to the bridge deserves respect!)<br>
<br>
What I also see is a new generation of people who are planes ready yet are planes inexperienced.  For them, open raids are the only way that they will be able to get plane equipment.  They might not have the guild, the friends, the connections to go any other way.  Perhaps when they asked to join your guild they were turned down because they were level 50 with an oracle robe and staff of writhing.<br>
<br>
What I would like to see is a list of guilds that would be willing to take people, that are not of their guild, to planes and other raids.  I am going to post a note on general and if your guild does do this please post saying so.  Just thought it would be nice to actually have a list of some sort showing which guilds will do this.  I know it might cause some tells and maybe some rudeness of people if you do not need those classes or if they want you to stop the raid so they can come join late.  The reason why I ask this is that people who are not in big guilds or are unguilded may have a chance to experience a well planned and balanced raid.<br>
<br>
I'll quit rambling for now just thought I'd add some.<br>

Suddenly these raids are WRONG, and ABUSING THE CALENDAR. And because I am in a large guild, I am TAKING ADVANTAGE.<br>
<br>
I am getting really frustrated by this. I have devoted a lot of time and energy into these raids, and I don't plan to stop as long as there is interest. <br>
<br>
Simply because you now realize that you need to get to the planes for often for your epic, you try to close these down. Why? Cause they are an easy target. The little guy is always the easiest to step on.<br>

Just about every open raid is on PST.  That leaves out those of us on EST who need to start earlier if we want to make it to the end without missing work the next day.  For example, if I want to attend a PoF raid and stay until the end, It needs to start around 6 EST or earlier if possible.  I can do this with guild raids, people can start and others join in later.  Goal is to get done as early as possible.  I have found open raids don't have those goals making them poorly suited for everyone.  Now, what I could do is hold my own open raids and have them start at an earlier time but thats just going to clog up the calandar even more.<br>

If you lead the raids, you can establish some control over how it's done.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilynnamaytidilaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milynna Mayti Dilaan</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 425<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/5/01 1:00:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=568.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> This issue was discussed and a solution presented at the last council of guilds meeting.<br>

I don't know if I should flame or just step back and throw my hands up.  I mean how is it that you managed to find this thread from way back yet you totally missed the thread about the council of guilds that has some 94 replies to it.   Anyways, everyone on the server is part of the council of guilds, all it requires is that you show up when they post meetings.  Its not a private club.  I will go ahead and bump that thread for you on the long shot that you actually did miss it and your not just trying to stir the pot.<br>

When it comes down to it, there's no formal council at all; just some people who are trying to help.  To me, it's a good thing -- I wish others saw it that way. <p><hr align="center" size="1">

I think Valas brought to people's attention the abuse of Open Raids. Hence a guideline was made which seemed to free the calendar up some. Mily has been sponsoring open raids since forever, so I don't she should have to stop cause she joined a uber guild. I remember just as Mily does when it was Bitchfest '00 cause oh there's only so many weekend spots. Why aren't people going to the planes on the weekdays. Yada yada. The calendar does more harm than good in my book is my last point. Lastly, I'm still sporting my Oracle Robe and Staff of Writhing I wanted to say. Does the equipment make the player more effective, yes. Can a player make the equipment he has more effective, yes also. Enjoy the game being a game and nothing more. <br>

Come on people, look at all the problems your making for your selfs.  This is a GAME so lay back a little and have some fun. Sheeesh the planes are not for guilds they are for PEOPLE over the level of 46, EVERY single one of you have the right to go to the planes ANY time you please. And if your over the level of 46, Well you diserve to go. If your in a guild or not. And if your going to put your back side on the line and go up to help kill these mobs, Then your entitled to have a far chance at the loot. I play this GAME to have fun! and why should i or you, have anyone telling us where and when we can hunt and what we can and cant loot? we post to these boards to let people know what we are doing and planing, Not to ask if we can! We have that privilege given to us each month when WE ALL PAY to play this game. So im not going to tell anyone they cant go to the planes or anywhere else for that matter. I think people getting together to do something like a planes raid is aswome and what the game is all about. So STOP being greedy and join in the fun!!! And if your NOT having a goodtime in the GAME well maybe thats something to thing about.<br>
