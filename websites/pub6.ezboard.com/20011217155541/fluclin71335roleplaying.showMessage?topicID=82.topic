                               of Rivervale <br>
<br>
   In the beginning, Diob was a young thief; he followed in the path of his father Oleic. <br>
His mother who he never knew had left him and his father for a dwarven thief by the name of Talguard.   To this day him and his father have a deep hatred for any dwarfs that might cross their paths.   A dead dwarf is a good dwarf, also makes for fatter pockets too.  Diob was a very good student of his father and learned fast this ways of thievery.  His father feared Diob for he was more diabolic than he ever was.  Always looking for new ways to get money and get back at the dwarves for making his mother abandon him.  His hatred would be his demise if he did not control it. <br>
 <br>
  This is where our story begins, Diob had just killed a dwarven sheriff of Kaladim and the guards were hot on his trail.   He tried every trick in his arsenal to try to loose them to no avail.   He finally took refuge in the Es6ate of Unrest.   He thought surely the dwarven guards would not follow him to such a cursed place.   To his surprise they followed him into the haunted estate.  Diob was very cautious of the undead of the house as he snuck by them unnoticed.   The dwarven guards entered the house and were immediately attacked, they put up a valiant effort but were soon defeated by the power of the undead.   Diob during this time made his was back the Butcher Block Mountains hoping to sneak aboard the ship to Antonica.   He was meet at the dock by the Elite Guard of Kaladim and they took him into custody, Diob put up a great fight but at the end laid down his weapon if fear they might slay him if he resisted anymore.   He was brought before the King of Kaladim.  To his surprise the King was the same dwarf his mother had ran away with and now he knew truly why she had left him and his father.  It was all about gold; she was the mistress of the dwarven king and was treated as royalty.    This is what saved his life, for his mother had kept track of her son and knew of his exploits.  She begged the king to forgive his son and release him and she would stay by his side forever.  The King looked down at his mistress and granted her wish, for he was in love and could do nothing to hurt her.   He banished Diob from his kingdom and told him to never return, if he ever did he would not leave again.  Only his head would and it would be sent to the rogues in Rivervale to show that their kind will not be tolerated.<br>
 <br>
   Diob gathered his stuff and was preparing to leave when his mother entered the room.  She asked that she be forgiven and said that she still love him and his father but the King could offer her what his father never could.   Diob looked down and was sad but looked into him mother’s eyes and started to cry.   Forgive me for what I must do, he hugged his mother, as he hugged her he drew out his dagger and thrust it into her back.   Surprised his mothers looked into his eyes and begin to cry.   Thy father has taught you to well Diob.  Diob said tis not my father that had made me do this, tis my hatred of you and your lover.   My father would never have let me do this but I must do this to avenge your dishonorable act.  Diob’s mother stared into her son’s eye and took her last breath.   On this day Diob became a true rogue and assassin.   He took his own mothers life to keep the faith in the code of the rogues. <br>
 <br>
  Diob silently left the castle, his pockets full of all the gold he could carry, plus the head of his mother to show his father.   Diob from this day on was known as the rogue who took his own mothers life.    Beware the entire world there is a thief with a black heart who has no love for anyone who will betray him or his father.<br>
 <br>
  This is the beginning of Diob’s journey into the World of Norrath.  Upon his return to his home in Rivervale his father rejected him for his dastardly dead.  The other rogues in the town looked him upon favorably, but many were scared of such a person.  He took it upon himself and left Rivervale never to return; to him this was not his home anymore.  Today a dark figure stepped upon the paths and trails of Norrath.  A person who’s loyalty to his father caused him to kill his mother and for this his father rejected him.   Now he wonders Norrath taking what he pleases and kills all those who oppose him.  <br>
