Get the fuck out! You are taking the jobs of Americans who are unemployed. You are sending the money you make back to wherever the fuck it is you came from and not spending it in country.<br>
<br>
Half of you are not paying taxes. Just take your asses back wherever you came from, because as much as we have to put up with you because of workplace diversity policies, you are very much so NOT welcomed here.<br>
<br>
If you hold a visa or green card and you plan to stay here and pay taxes and live your life this is not directed to you. If you hold a visa and plan to send money to your parents and go home and be rich and not give anything back to America then this IS directed towards you.  <p>Pictures are worth a thousand words.

As far as goverment being responsible, yes they are.  I used to be a registered republican till those fucks let every dick and harry computer-skilled-will-work-for-45K-a-year MOFO into the country.  <br>
<br>
USA should only be allowed to to employ an X amount of people who have been in this country less than 10 years. <br>

<br>
I agree with you up top that I think they should do a complete biological background before letting anybody get a decent job such as the ones you are speaking of. What gives anybody but the true american the right to make any type of money here?<br>
<br>
Okay but seriously I think all of you above that are agreeing with the sarcasm that I wrote are just pathetic. Who the fuck are you to determine who can or can not earn an honest living in this country. I agree with you that it's wrong to send your money out of country free of taxes, but you ever maybe thought that they may have family they're trying to support??<br>
<br>
I put up with stuppid ignorant people each and every day that think along the same lines as you above, so don't expect to try to flame me succesfully, I listen to people everyday talk their shit to me face to face after I tell them what I think of them after hearing this bullshit so your words are not going to hurt me none. I doubt any of you have actually even spoken to me in game since I rarely play anymore and when I do I solo more than I group.<br>
<br>
And this does not include you Nicolai(sp).. you were the only one NOT to jump the gun and start bitching, and you're right it is the governments fault that they do not tax them properly.<br>
<br>
And Kit if your husband realy wants to stay in work full time, maybe he should consider perfecting his trade, since he finds himself out of work often it sems maybe if he were a bit more of an asset to a company they will see that his talents are worth the regular pay instead of some &quot;half assed foreigner&quot; for half assed wages.<br>
<br>
And I don't hate any of you, I just hate what all you fucktards are doing to this great country of ours, the land of oppertunity, not greed.<br>
<br>
Nice chatting with you all.<br>

[Q]My husband is incredible at what he does, hence the huge amount money he earns per year.

<br>
Anyone else see the irony in this statement? Obviously if they're willing to hire people with less credentials, then they do not need someone with the credentials of your husband.  Maybe your husband's field has changed dramatically and thus his skills which were once rare are now abundant or not needed..  Blaming your husband's unemployment on immigration is a rather calous argument.<br>

For a few reasons. They can support their families in other places for less. They can use a tax loopholes to get out of paying ANY income taxes. They don't mind substandard living because hell it's only for a little while and when they go home they'll be rich.<br>
<br>
The government is not the problem, the problem is big business. They save money by using these people because like I said they cost half as much. The lobbiests representing these businesses backed by millions of dollars convince government officials to vote certain ways on these issues.<br>

The average American, backed by around fifty dollars can't do shit about it.<br>

( to stop any of the Kneejerkers from saying I hate immigrants).<br>
<br>
 H1B Visas are BAD!!!<br>
<br>
they are NOT made for people to move to this country and build a better life they are for &quot; temporary work&quot; why is this bad you ask?<br>
<br>
BECAUSE shtibag corporations will hire people paying them slightly more than McDonald's wages and fire people who can earn a LIVING WAGE here.<br>
<br>
People on H1B Visa can only stay here a limited time and due loop holes can  escape Income Tax ( which if none of had to pay would be fine with me)<br>
<br>
This basically amounts to Indentured servitude of the H1B visa<br>
holder because,If they their job and their sponsor ( the company that vouched for a big pile of H1B visas ) they get deported INSTANTLY<br>
<br>
so this is basically how it works:<br>
<br>
Corporation petitions 10 H1B visas<br>
<br>
They fire Bill who makes 50K/year<br>
<br>
They hire 10 people from war torn Mgbadistania paying them 5K/year<br>
<br>
They work them like Slaves because they dare not speak up<br>
<br>
Bill doesn't pay taxes cause he has no income and actually drains the system by collecting unemployment<br>
<br>
The 10 people from war torn Mgbadistania don't pay income taxes because of loopholes and send their earned money back to their families in Mgbadistania<br>
<br>
The corporation smiles and counts all their extra money because the didn't have to pay withholding , Social Securty, insurance ECT.<br>
<br>
The Government frown because they haven't collected Taxes from Bill or the 10 Mgbadistanians and raises everyone else's taxes<br>
<br>
