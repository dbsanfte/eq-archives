Dozekar and Named have been a single rotation npc from the beginning.  This has been known.  I have no objection to these being on a single rotation.  <br>
<br>
However I do have a problem with the named drakes being left up for days.  most of the named drakes are in the south and east portions of HOT.  Pulling from those areas is difficult to impossible in some areas without pulling getting a named.  Doing FD splits on every pull to split off a named is time consuming to say the least.   When Dozekar has been dead for 3 days and there are named up there is a major problem going on.  Guild up for Dozekar need to be monitoring HOT for the named, and kill within 24 hour spawn time in my opinion.  To do otherwise will cause the problems seen here of guilds killing them, out of frustration of trying to get to the non-named npcs. <p><a href="http://www.yopolis.com/syndicate" target="_blank">

As far as the named Drakes that are tied to the Doze drop quests, I don't agree with this due to what Vorth stated.  It adds additional time to have to split mobs from the nameds.  If Doze and all the named Drakes were in an area where they don't get in the way of other pulls then I could see Doze and the named Drakes as a package deal scenario viable.  But as it stands the named drakes are pretty spread out throughout HoT.  Also should all quest that are linked be reserved as a &quot;package&quot;?<br>
<br>
Issue 2:<br>
I wasn't even going to make a statement about this but it ties in with Doze rotaion.<br>
<br>
What is the proper ettiquette for killing Doz if a guild is already at the entrance to HoT door?  I understand there are time constraints as to how long a rotation mob is up before he is auto-passed and can sympathize with that but does that give any guild on Doze rotation the right to run over another guild that has the entrance to HoT camped.<br>
<br>
Let me say El'lar Dobluth is not a guild with the raw massive numbers of Tindi or NB nor do we have the skill set and damage of BotS in small numbers so we choose to do the entrance to HoT rather then go deeper in.  We have moved deeper in but it resulted in several wipes and long CRs.<br>
<br>
I have never had any issues with VoLS nor LoL and really don't now even thos the following events transpired so this is not a rant about either guild but more of seeking clarification on ettiquette.<br>
<br>
As previously posted on the day mentioned earlier in this thread, El'lar were first at the entrance to HoT and it was by common standard on the Rathe, camped.  VoLS wanted to attempt Doze and after we cleared the front mobs and side mobs, we as a courtesy allowed them to move through us and attempt Doze.  We were there at 11:00 AM EST and by the time VoLS had finished with the attempt and CR (VoLS almost won but failed) which  we assisted in it was around 1:00 PM.  <br>
<br>
Our help to VoLS resulted in a VoLS shammy (Halimar? whom we rezzed) dragging his or someone elses corpse close to HoT door and causing us to have to evac and some members to die. Why would our members get aggro you ask?  AE mana song is your answer.<br>
<br>
During the time VoLS was attempting Doze, LoL was assembling and waiting to see if VoLS would kill Doze.  Doomas who is a civil guy asked in /ooc if someone was killing Doze and they were told VoLS was attempting him as we waited out of HoT so they could attempt Doze in the Pit area.  We /ooc'd HoT entrance was camped and ED was waiting for VoLs to finish their CR.  Doomas then /ooc'd ED would have to wait again because LoL was moving in to kill Doze to which my response in /ooc ED would not wait again since we had been waiting for a camp that we had rights to by being there first and allowed VoLS to move through us.  At this point Doomas gave me a tell asking politely if LoL could do Doze and I told him no due to the long wait my guild had endured already and that my guildies and myself had real life time invested just ticking away although we were there first.  <br>
<br>
Again we allowed VoLS to move through us as a courtesy to them and did not pull mobs to not interfere in their attempt.  I thought was over from here due to no more tells from Doomas and that LoL would wait until we finished our raid.<br>
<br>
Later Darkveinn of LoL asked nicely if they could do Doze and we said no due to delaying our own raid for 3 hours now as VoLS attempted Doze and the ensuing CR.  We moved in to HoT again and rezzed our dead from the VoLS induced dr'aggro.  Then again assisted in VoLS CR which resulted in a roamer aggro due to one of VoLS clerics getting too close to the pit, aggroing a roamer and resulted more deaths and evacs.  LoL also was talking to Warrik (I assume) and also helped CR VoLS.<br>
<br>
Then I was given a tell by Brotor and old friend that LOL will be moving in to kill Doze. It was not a request but a statement that they would move thorugh regardless if we had HoT entrance camped or not.  I knew this was not Brotor by his manner of speech to me and asked who it was.  Darkveinn said it was he (Darkveinn) who was playing Brotor now.  He became irate and demanded to be allowed to move through and threatened never to help us with CR and laughed at how we had mobs gate on us and became generally pissy because LoL had 24 hours to kill him and they were on the 20th hour.  I simply told him it is not El'lar's fault LoL did not get to HoT before us and I received more of don't expect LoL to bail you out on CRs, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
To make a long story longer, morale was down due to all the wasted time and our own members dieing due to VoLS CR.  I decided it would be better to just let LoL kill Doze than risking a huge guild pissing contest and more deaths.  At this announcement to my guild, we lost several people at the raid due to frustration and not wanting to wait further.  <br>
<br>
Darkveinn was vey happy and upbeat when I told him LoL could do Doze.  So LoL was allowed to move through us and kill Doze with one the stipulation.  They would get one attempt and if they failed, they would sumon corpses rather then CR to entrance of HoT.  Darkveinn (playing Brotor) agreed and they went about killing him and he was thankful.  A pair of plate gloves dropped as they cleared around Doze area and I was given tell to loot them so I could MQ it for one of our guildies.  LoL killed Doze and there was much rejoicing on both sides.<br>
<br>
Now we thought finally, we can start our raid.  It was around 3:30 PM EST, 4.5 hours before we had HoT camped and then I get a request from VoLS if they could move through us again and pull mobs to Doze room.  To which I agreed and since Doze was killed and LoL were rezzing there dead in Doze room.  I told VoLS to move in and I don't know what happened but VoLS went to Doze room and brought some mobs I guess which resulted in some LOL people dieing as told to me by Darkveinn (playing Brotor).  I don't know what took place as far as mobs getting into Doze room so can't really say more than that.<br>
<br>
Well after LOL was done and VoLS was in Doze room, I started pulling for our raid but sadly we had lost too many people and mobs kept gating so I ended the raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
SO IF YOU DIDN'T CARE TO READ THRHOUGH THAT NOVEL, ANSWER THIS GUYS:<br>
<br>
My point in all this is why should any guild, that has HoT camped, be forced to wait for the Doze rotation guild to kill Doze?  Again, I am not trying to slam VoLS or LoL but I think some of you can see how our raid was disrupted.  I think if you were in my shoes, you could understand the frustration on that day.<br>
