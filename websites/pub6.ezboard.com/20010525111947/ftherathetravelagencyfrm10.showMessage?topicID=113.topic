<br>
I realize that the calendaring system is intended for the Planes and certainly agreed to the original calendaring proposal on behalf of my guild (I have some squick, as I said in another thread, about the details -- the devil continues to be in them -- but am in wait and see mode while I try to get my thoughts together).  But that's not what this post is about.  <br>
<br>
This post is about the following dumb questions that I -- as co-leader of a guild with sharply limited experience in high level encounters other than that which a handful of our members have acquired to date - (and to date I am not one of them although I'm trying &lt;sniffle&gt;) -- cannot find answers to following my own informal search.  <br>
<br>
Dumb Question 1:  Does there exist a parallel system of reservation for non-planes encounters? Such as Vox, Nagafen, Gorenaire, Venril Sathir and the remaining Dragonship Connection (George Clinton reference, think nothing of it)?<br>
<br>
Sub-Dumb Question 1(a):  Are those types of encounters FFA at the moment? <br>
<br>
Sub-Dumb Question 1(b):  If so, didn't scheduling of Vox and Nagafen used to be on some sort of coordinated system (or is this my imagination running away with me)? <br>
<br>
Sub-Dumb Question 1(c):  If they were, what led to the change?<br>
<br>
Dumb Question 2:  If the answer to Sub-Dumb Question 1(a) is &quot;no&quot;, where would one find information about this?<br>
<br>
Mega-Sub-Dumb Question 2:  Is the process of invitation to participate in those events based on each individuals' guild rules (i.e. some guilds have a fixed number of &quot;outsiders&quot; they will invite on events, others do not) or is there some sort of centralized system or set of rules/standands (I'm a lawyer and there is a *big* difference to me in those words) as well?<br>
<br>
Dumb Question 3: Why does this matter? <br>
<br>
[Here's where I violate the rules of gentle discussion and answer my own question =)]<br>
<br>
Well, first and foremost I ask because I am unclear and want to be clear about the things that I can realistically shoot for in planning for myself and my guild and those I cannot.  I don't want to decide, for example, that I will try to put together a group of friends to take on Vox (a huge deal to me even as I know it is a NBD to many others here) engage in planning for weeks -- often necessary for us small fry guilds, many of which have memberships largely comprised of those who are either raising a passel of kids or working 60 hour weeks or God help us both like myself -- only to find out that it's first come first serve and we're SOL because other, larger guilds more often than not have critical mass online around the clock.  <br>
<br>
The other reason it matters at least to me personally it is that it seems to me that if we recognize that there is a larger universe of &quot;high level encounters&quot; that many are interested in playing, not just the three planes, it might reduce some of the acrimony that, while it has thankfully subsided in most posts now, continues to exist when we're talking about the calendar, who can post, and it's potential impacts.  In other words, maybe we're looking at too small a pool of possibilities and that's what is causing some of the squick?<br>
<br>
I apologize again for my ignorance and ask for any information/guidance that anyone might have on this.  You can see that I am a novice, but I don't mind being one so (someone regularly posts in other threads here in words that imply that you have no legitimate voice unless you've &quot;been there, done that&quot; and that is highly discouraging to those who want to learn rather than meander).  Everyone was, at some point.  I just happen to be an anal retentive novice and want to be sure rather than screw up relationships with folks on the server by mistake.  I like to think I have some pretty decent ones considering I'm a &quot;casual player&quot;.<br>
<br>

<br>
These encounters, in some cases, take alot less planning, and alot less can go wrong.<br>
<br>
Normally when a conflict occurs, the party leaders will come to an agreement.Also most dragons are on a timer alot longer than any of the planes.<br>
<br>
Plus the calendar system was designed to prevent a problem such as 40% + of the server being in the Plane of Fear at peak times, whereas this number of players is unlikely to show for a raid such as Nagafen.<br>

This pretty much fell to the wayside, however, when the server was crashing so much, it was difficult to &quot;schedule&quot; these events.  What's Vox slaying without Vox?  (There's a week respawn on Vox/Naggy.)  Much ruckus was raised when there were no longer &quot;reservations&quot; on the dragons.  It became as much a foot race as anything else.  Then the nerf came putting many out of the race.  &lt;shrugs&gt;<br>
<br>
Being out of the level ranges (as is most of my guild as well), I haven't really kept up with how the dragon raids are going.  They are, as far as I am aware, FFA.<br>

<br>
Dumb Question 1: Does there exist a parallel system of reservation for non-planes encounters? Such as Vox, Nagafen, Gorenaire, Venril Sathir and the remaining Dragonship Connection (George Clinton reference, think nothing of it)?&quot;<br>
<br>
----No, due to the reasons the others specified.  These spawns are hard to time, and being they arn't easy to take they generaly go to who ever can get the groups together fast enough.  In cases where this might mean one or more guilds they just talk it out... usualy.----<br>
<br>
&quot;Sub-Dumb Question 1(a): Are those types of encounters FFA at the moment? &quot;<br>

<br>
---Uh, I think the answer to your question depends on the guilds involved.  If you want to do one of these guys talk to some of the larger guilds about it, or when the mob is up talk to them about it.  Most of the mobs mentioned arn't taken down by single guilds, so they will work with you if you work with them.---<br>

<br>
---The planes are a whole day thing, where as most of the other events our.  Being that there is also class specific armor that drops there that EVERYONE wants, the flow of it has to be regulated enough so that people don't end up crawling over eachother and fighting for it all.

<br>
Thank you for pointing out the largest, best reason for the planes to have a Calendar.  The calendar allows small, medium, and large guilds the chance to plan an &quot;event&quot; such that they can &quot;do&quot; a plane.  <br>
<br>
Maybe it just me, but the planes have never been about &quot;uber&quot; loot for me.  They have always been about the &quot;raid&quot;.  I got my shiverback jerkin my first Fear raid, my boots my second Hate raid.  But I still continue to go, why?  Because its fun!  To watch out alliance (Silver Blade/Noble House) work like a machine tearing the mobs apart.  Or making that bad pull (monk = puller =) but yet they somehow pull it out and we live!<br>
<br>
I just can't imagine going to the planes and just killing repops.  Talk about boring.</font><P>Milambus Mandragon<BR>

However, I have been on The Rathe and sufficient level to do just about everything when it was available to be done and have been at least a first-hand watcher, if not a participant, of most everything that has happened in the scheduling of resources among groups/guilds, including long before the first calendar system.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;| Dumb Question 1: Does there exist a parallel system of<br>
&gt;| reservation for non-planes encounters? Such as Vox,<br>
&gt;| Nagafen, Gorenaire, Venril Sathir and the remaining<br>
&gt;| Dragonship Connection (George Clinton reference, think<br>
&gt;| nothing of it)?<br>
<br>
<br>
No.  There is no official scheduling mechanism for these.  See 1(a).<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;| Sub-Dumb Question 1(a): Are those types of encounters<br>
&gt;| FFA at the moment? <br>
<br>
<br>
No.  They are not FFA.  They are FCFS but there is a matter of convention that most of us (the groups that can &quot;do&quot; the event) abide by in determining who is there &quot;first&quot;.  Being there &quot;first&quot; is different for each of those encounters.  For instance, &quot;first&quot; for Nagafen was agreed upon by BotS, KEG, CIW, and a few others long before the Level-53-Nerf to be the first group that assembled in SolB and *successfully* pull the first set of Fire Giants out front and kill them.  Once the group did that, everyone else would leave.  For Vox, it was similar.  The first group to pull the Ice Giants successfully was there &quot;first&quot;.  Most all the Kunark big mobs also have similar &quot;first&quot; agreements that are group-to-group agreements among the guilds that kill them.  There has always been and continues to be quite a bit of organizational chat between most, if not all, of the larger groups on The Rathe that goes on outside of the scope and view of the calendar system.  When there are fewer than 3 to 5 groups doing something, it is easier to work it out in a sideband than to deal with calendar systems.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;| Sub-Dumb Question 1(b): If so, didn't scheduling of<br>
&gt;| Vox and Nagafen used to be on some sort of coordinated<br>
&gt;| system (or is this my imagination running away with me)? <br>
<br>
<br>
No, it never was.  Early on people would sometimes post on their guild forums and on the other guilds' forums who could also &quot;do&quot; those things but it was never really formalized.  Sometimes groups would reply to those posts saying that they wanted to do them too and would require a race to the mob.  It very quickly changed to the systems described in 1(a) because of the numbers of groups/people wanting to do them.  Unlike the planes, way back in the day there weren't 40+ groups that were capable of doing those things.  There were closer to 5 groups.  Today, I don't know how Vox/Nagafen are handled because of the Level-53-Nerf.  My guild doesn't deal with those two mobs anymore.  I think Vox is almost always available.  I haven't been paying attention but I don't think Vox has been killed more than a half dozen times on our server since the Level-53-Nerf.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;| Sub-Dumb Question 1(c): If they were, what led to<br>
&gt;| the change?<br>
<br>
<br>
Too many people were wanting to do those things.  More people means harder to coordinate.  After you had to start posting on 123212 different guild boards that you wanted to do a dragon it simply was too much overhead.  FCFS is far easier to judge when there are only a handful of groups that attempt the mob.<br>
<br>
From what I have observed on our server (and probably occurrs on others where there are more than one guild that does it all) is that there are several stages in event planning.  At first, there is one group that can do the mob.  No coordination necessary.  At some point, a second group &quot;beats&quot; the first group to set up and gets a shot or a few and eventually succeeds.  As the second group gets more proficient, these first two groups usually make some sort of arrangement of sharing or define what FCFS rules there will be.  After a while, a third and a fourth group start attempting and eventually succeed.  At this point, more communication is required to modify the (then) current rules to include provisions for all the groups involved.  As the number of groups grows past 5 or so, more formalized rules have to be applied.  As the number gets probably to more than  7, some sort of global communication scheme has to come about (like a calendar system) where the current agreed upon rules are posted publicly and others are invited to participate within those rules.  Eventually, when there get to be more than 12 or so groups, things start to break down.  Planes are easy, they are there every day.  Long spawn time mobs are a pain to deal with.  With 10 groups on Trakanon for instance, a simple round-robin scheme would mean that a single group gets a shot once each month.  For VS, that would be once every 2.5 months for the same 10 groups (not including Karnor's zone crashes).  When the number of groups for even every day spawn things reaches 20, a lot of friction starts to develop.  When the number reaches 30+, usually a revamp will has to occur or there will be mass tension and bad things start to happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;| Dumb Question 2: If the answer to Sub-Dumb Question<br>
&gt;| 1(a) is &quot;no&quot;, where would one find information<br>
&gt;| about this?<br>
<br>
<br>
You probably won't find any public information on this for some of the mobs as it is usually something that is agreed upon in /tells in game or on IRC channels with different members of the different guild/groups.  OpSec on different boards can tell you that there are such agreements/disagreements from time to time.  As there get to be more groups, more information becomes available.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;| Mega-Sub-Dumb Question 2: Is the process of invitation<br>
&gt;| to participate in those events based on each<br>
&gt;| individuals' guild rules (i.e. some guilds have a fixed<br>
&gt;| number of &quot;outsiders&quot; they will invite on events, others<br>
&gt;| do not) or is there some sort of centralized system or<br>
&gt;| set of rules/standands (I'm a lawyer and there is a<br>
&gt;| *big* difference to me in those words) as well?<br>
<br>
<br>
