<br>
1.  The security was tighter because tensions in the Middle East are high.  Namely, some Muslems tend to not like Jewish people (Israel) and vice versa.  Therefore, there was perceived to be a higher risk of some outside source sabotaging the shuttle.  For instance, someone on the ground shooting a man-portable SAM at the shuttle as it launched (that's one hell of a heat signature - no pun intended) or perhaps someone sneaking into the prep area and planting an explosive on the orbiter/launcher itself.<br>
<br>
2.  The other idea was that some terrorist organization could have somehow fired a missle/projectile at the orbiter as it re-entered the atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Scenario #2 above is *highly* unlikely unless terrorists have technology that is beyond any nation currently on the planet.  A vehicle traveling at 200,000+ feet high at a speed of mach 18+ is extremely hard to track and successfully intercept.  This is indeed the purpose behind one of our highest funded non-black military projects (tracking/intercepting high altitude deployed warheads).<br>
<br>
They believe Scenario #1 is also very unlikely due to the increased security around the site during launch prep.<br>
<br>
Heh, until I saw your post thinking that the Israeli astronaut was being accused of being a terrorist, that thought had never entered my mind. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=willowfeather>Willowfeather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/2/03 9:26:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1025.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Umm, WTF Kagato?</span><hr size=1> You want to actually decrease our defense budget to boost spending on space exploration?<br>
<br>
First of all, Columbia was the oldest shuttle.  It was built in 1979, not 1981.  Her first mission was in 1981.  I decommissioned a ship 4 years ago that was commissioned in 1963.  I was on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, a carrier that was built in 1980.  There are many, many carriers still in service much older than TR, like the JFK, whose keel was laid (if memory serves) in 1964.    The F-14 Tomcat was designed in 1973.  The F/A-18 Hornet were operational in the early 80's.  These are the navy's best fighting jets.  On the other hand, the space shuttle Endeavor was built in 1991, just before Bill Clinton started slashing away at the NASA budget when he entered office in 1993.  In the past two years the NASA budget has increased by 1.5% and 2% respectively, by the same man who has lowered your taxes, Kagato.  You do work don't you?<br>
<br>
Ok, those facts alone should put aside your ridiculous notion that because the Columbia was so old, we do not put enough money in the space program, but instead put &quot;far far far&quot; too much money into defense.  Now, it is true that the DoD budget is 25 times greater then the Nasa budget, but we do want to preserve freedom do we not?  You are aware that there are men out there that will stop at nothing to kill as many Americans as they can, aren't you?  Is it so ridiculous to put money in &quot;the military and defense&quot;?  Of course, you who sit back and enjoy the freedoms that others have worked to secure for you, may not truly appreciate what it means to have such freedoms.<br>
<br>
And, as for the &quot;government officials&quot; (rather vague term, don't you think -- those EVIL government officials!!!) who keep &quot;giving themselves boosts&quot;....  well, you are aware of the 27th amendment to the constitution right?  Are you aware of the constitution?  Well, there is this thing called the Constitution that was written by some early American patriots in 1787.  Various amendments have been added to this document over the years, and one of them states that when Congress votes in a pay raise, it cannot take effect until AFTER the next election.  So, if you feel that Congress or the &quot;government officials&quot; as you so eloquently put it, keep &quot;giving themselves boosts&quot; then you do know what to do, don't you?  Vote.  Yes, it's this little thing some of us Americans do in November of the even numbered years for National elections, and at various other times throughout the year for local and state elections.  We do this, Kagato.  <br>
<br>
Maybe, instead of posting drabble on message boards about topics that are beyond your limited understanding, just maybe you should pick up a history book and see what your country is all about.  Maybe you should see how spending &quot;far far far&quot; too much money on the military has saved your ass from a life of tyrrany. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stylina>Stylina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/2/03 10:19:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1025.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Something that actually saddens me (nasa)</span><hr size=1> I am an American.

You said, quote: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I really didn't like that Americans first thing on their mind was 'TERRORIST' and points to the israeli man... that's straight up bull-shit. I feel bad for him.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Ignoring your 2nd grade level writing skills, what you're saying here is that the first thing on an American's mind was &quot;TERRORIST&quot;.  Again, disputing this would be stupid.<br>
<br>
To make it REALLY REALLY simple:<br>
<br>
A: Stylina = American.<br>
<br>
B: American = First thought was &quot;TERRORIST&quot;.<br>
<br>
With me so far?  Ok.<br>
<br>
From that reasonably simple recollection of facts, it can be reasonably concluded (Well, by reasonable people) that you believe:<br>
<br>
C: Stylina (and every other American) = First thought was &quot;TERRORIST&quot;.<br>
<br>
Did we get lost somewhere between A, B, and C or are you as bad at thinking as you are at typing or writing?<br>
<br>
If that wasn't clear to you, lemme give you an analogy.<br>

now, do you have an exact list of every dollar spent in the defense program? no you don't. do you know shit? no you dont. do i no shit? no i don't, HOWEVER i do know that if more money was invested in the space program, and if the american people supported it durring pres. kenedy's race to the moon with rush we would be quite a bit farther than we are now. now shut your mouth my friend. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagato69>Kagato69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm kittens</span><br>  Posts: 706<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/2/03 11:53:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1025.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   and also</span><hr size=1> in regard to my saying <br>

It seems that ppl want to believe in what they watch and hear from the media.  The point I tried to convey in my original post is, &quot;how long do you think it would take the media (being either television, papers, radio) to mention the &quot;T&quot; word.  I believe what the bot guy had to say that there was no chance it could have been an act of cowardice...err terrorism.  <br>
<br>
I wanted to show though that the media in one form or another has a factor in controlling our lives and making it more interesting to see events.  No, just because some astronauts went in space capture our attention.  But, when they mention the ethnic profiling of them do we care and then be bombasted with conspiricy theories, experts on this that and the other thing.  <br>
<br>
In the world people hate people for one thing or another, so the media had to think of a way to possibly put this into context (Canadian media showing coverage from CNN).  With the possibility of an assualt in the middle east by new coalition forces, the media would look for anything to tie stories together.  The media should be held accountable for stereotyping individuals or groups and presenting them in bad light.  Are all motorcyclists part of Hells Angels?  No, alot like Jay Leno, Arnold, and many professionals do it for relaxation and fun.   That's just one example, but I don't feel I have to list more because we are all bright people here.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to find out what had happened on Television, but instead found myself disgusted in what the media had twisted this tragic event and made a mockery of those peoples lives.<br>

Neither has any of the shuttle orbiters.  At one time, there were five of them (Columbia, Discovery, Challenger, Atlantis, and Endeavour).  Now there are three.  I think that the Columbia had been launched 28 times.  They were designed to carry out 100 missions each before being retired.<br>
<br>
Another thing you have to remember is that these large projects take lots of time to design.  Although the Columbia was actually *built* in 1979, the design probably started in the late 60s to very early 70s.  On most large projects like these, by the time the thing starts being built, the equipment in the designs is basically obsolete (but... it is also tried-and-true).<br>
<br>
There was a plan for a 2nd generation shuttle design but GW cut it from the budget last year I think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sandalorn>Sandalorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I am the Highway!</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/3/03 11:50:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1025.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Please never believe that the American media speaks for the American people.

Just because one or two reporters might have stroked the &quot;Terrorism&quot; word a few times for shock value doesn't mean the majority of the American people were running around in a panic on Saturday screaming that the Terrorists were coming to get us.<br>

In particular they want a reentry vehicle that can hold more than the soyez capsule currently used as an emergency escape system on the space station.  During the last half of the 90's they were experementing with various new reentry systems.  In particular they are trying to work out a horizontal take off and landing system.  If I can find the link to it I will post it. The past 3 years they have developed a test model they are now testing.  Last I read, they were doing drops from planes to test aerodynamics, also including wind tunnel testing.<br>
<br>
Also just an FYI the shuttle were built in this order:<br>
<br>
Enterprise - Now on display at Huntsville Alabama Space and Rocket Museum.  Was a test model for aerodynamic testing. Not capable of space travel.<br>
<br>
Challenger - Orginally built for further testing of the shuttle design. Was later modified to become capable of space flight.<br>
<br>
Columbia - First shuttle designed and built with the expectation of space flight.<br>
<br>
Discovery - Second shuttle built in anticpation of the U.S. Space Station.<br>
<br>
Endeavor - Built to replace the destroyed Challenger. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kagato69>Kagato69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm kittens</span><br>  Posts: 710<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(2/3/03 1:52:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1025.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   bummer</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There was a plan for a 2nd generation shuttle design but GW cut it from the budget last year I think. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
