I want to thank Lag and Flarren for the chance to be there. I would love to go again..third time is a charm <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
I also want to thank Vaard, Ogun, Muji and the countless others who made it go so well for us. I know Naggy won both times, but I have faith that it will be our turn soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
Special thanks to the tanks, the groups who went time and again into the Lair to bring out bodies.  My first Dragon raid was something I will remember for a LONG time. You all made me proud and happy to be part of the group.  A million thank you's to ALL.<br>
Lagdalen....when do we go back ???<br>

Your setup was great, I thought, and your plan was sound. You did a great job of getting things moving, particularly in light of the number of no-shows.<br>
<br>
Like Rbecka, I was thrilled with the way the fight in the throne room went. I believe we had 6 FG's working there, and to still be standing at the end, though battered and bloody, was quite a thrill. Of course pulling that many at one time was not intentional, but good organization and sheer stubborness on the part of most of the raiders saw us through in fine fashion.<br>
<br>
The one time most everyone appeared to listen and follow orders was during the buffline. Where was that level of cooperation the rest of the night?<br>
<br>
Yes, the charge was called before the raid was ready. Both times, in fact (on the second charge, none of the healers were more than about half mana). And yes, that was a critical error. My question is, what happened to the stubborness and unwillingness to admit defeat that saw us take down the FG train? Is Naggy that awe inspiring? Do people not trust Ogun to stand by his word when he says he'll do rezes? If ALL the casters had stayed after it, Naggy would have died during the first attempt. Yes, I make that as an unqualified statement.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it wasn't clear to you why you were required to bind in the buff room. It was so, when you were killed, you could mem your damage spell and charge again! After my first death, I actually had to jump over casters who were sitting on their butts so I could get back in the fight! You think maybe you're special? You think you can jump in and have your shot at the dragon loot without doing your part? Well think again. If you want to charge in once, do your piddly little damage, then sit out the rest of the fight, then you better get used to the idea that you will never, EVER see ONE PIECE of dragon loot. This wasn't the first hard fight the CoG has had against a dragon, you know. Several times, the carnage has been insane by the time Naggy falls... but fall he will if the pressure is kept up. He doesn't have a healer.. even if you only land one spell before you die again, you're doing your part. Mem it and go do it again.<br>
<br>
/rant off. Sorry, but if we're gonna lose to a dragon, I'd rather it be because the target is too hard for us, not because half the raiders give up midway through the battle.<br>
<br>
Ogun, special thanks to you once again. I don't know how many times you've come out to support CoG raids, but each and every one is appreciated.<br>
<br>
Raiders who stayed with the fight... and there were some who did.. congratulations. You almost pulled it off in spite of the large number of slackers and freeloaders!<br>
<br>
All the FoF management team proved themselves worthy on this raid. If everyone will listen and follow orders, the CoG tradition of taking down one dragon after another will continue under FoF's leadership. If you choose not to listen and follow, then know that you're breaking the tradition, not FoF. They're doing their part.. are you?<br>

I enjoyed my first dragon raid, except for a few people that obviously did not listen to Lagdalen or the other raid management.  <br>
<br>
Once the rush was called to attack Nagafen, I got to see some true heroics.  I was truly amazed to see so many people come back so quickly for a heal.  I went OOM so fast that I thought I was going to kill myself trying to Canibalize! (* See note below)  Even with the lack of tanks, which I was not aware we had a lack, the healers were hard pressed to keep people healed.  The one complaint about the heal line that I have is that some healers, or pet owners, stood right where the tanks come in and targetting was hard.<br>
<br>
So, there I am trying to convert as much health into mana as I can to get 1 more heal off when I see Lagdalen fall (she was my group leader).  Soon as she spawned I see her run into the lair naked.  Not 5 seconds later she is dead again..... I saw her repeat that at least 6 times, and I had not died once (except for the time in Trannix's room).  Course soon as I thought that, I was summoned.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I managed to survive long enough to see corpses everywhere (and no live people) and to figure out what happened.<br>
<br>
I am truly sorry that I could not stay for round 2 and if that makes someone mad, I am sorry.  I was close to being awake for 24 hours straight, and the last 14 without food or drink.   And you can bet that I will be there for the next one as well!<br>
<br>
* Note:  This is not a rant or questioning authority, but to be honest I saw no reason for the healers to sacrifice Wisdom for MR and FR.  I could have squeezed out quite a few more heals had I not sacrificed Wisdom.  But I also know that there must be a reason for it.  Someone educate me on this one please.</font><P><hr>
