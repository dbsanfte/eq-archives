<br>
It's good of you to acknowledge that I'm all-knowing.  Even my friends seem to have trouble with that.  As for the night in question, I've done some research and I trust my guildmates and COMMON SENSE that would dictate that Noble Blade isn't going to go racing your guild to a mob that we don't need any fucking loot from.  Jesus, we've been regularly killing Cazic since shortly after he was upgraded.  We have much larger fish to fry.<br>
<br>
Fame?  I don't need fame.  I have my ego to keep me warm.  It's nice, however, to see a bit of bile thrown back and forth now and then.  Just to clarify...  No, Kiddies, we did not try to race you to Cazic Thule, any more than we trained King Tormax over you (That was SoT, fucktards).  <br>
<br>
Here's a nice little tip.  Call it an assurance.  If you ever need to get in on a rotation and it's Noble Blade's turn to take the mob, ASK KARADIN in a polite way.  Our guild has never refused to step aside and allow another guild a fair shot at a rotation mob.  How many times has your guild simply asked us for a chance?<br>
<br>
Unlike you, I know the answer to that question. I just can't think that you do, because if you did I think you'd be just a bit embarrassed about saying we've tried to screw you. <br>
<br>
Once again, for the Wrenfields in the class -- If your guild wants a shot at a rotation mob, and you're honest about it, make an effort to be prepared and ask KARADIN or MILAMBUS, in that order, for your chance at the mob.  You might just be surprised at what these backstabbing whores will say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zahrimxealdabooboos>Zahrim Xealdabooboos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(10/31/02 10:24:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=809.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.socal.rr.com/xariyl/images/kermit3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Getting warmer...</span><hr size=1> <br>
QUOTE: iniqy thundarump : &quot;Fuck noble blade, the jackass they are, bunch of punks who throw 70+ people at a mob just to get it killed, who lack all skill and need the masses to get shit done the biggest bunch of assholes i have ever had to deal with, even more so than SoT, sneaky, backstabbing whores who dont deserve to be able to play on this server that we call civilized&quot;<br>
<br>
Obviously you assume that just because YOUR guild Zergs mobs that all guilds do.  We do not.  I have been on this server for 14 months now, raided with Noble ALL of that time, I do not recall a time where we &quot;zerged&quot; an end game mob, just to get it dead, not even Master Yael.  There is thought and stratigey that goes into our raids, as we do not like loosing. Our leadership is just that, they lead we follow on a raid, we use successful strats and discard unsuccessful ones and move on.  Can your guild kill XTC with under 70 people (or at all for that matter)? i don't think so, even if you Zergged.<br>
<br>
You obviously think our behavior is uncivilized, you OBVIOUSLY haven't played on a FFA server, i played on 2.  If we, as a guild played by the rules of those servers i came from, you would never get any end game mobs and we would be hard pressed compeating with Tindi and BotS as they both out number us 2 to 1.  By calling us uncivilized is a slap in the face of Karadin and our officers, who do a LOT of work for this server AND our guild.  Who maintains the server rotations, who helps keep the calander updated, Milambus, he works hard on helping keep this server a sane and CIVILIZED place.<br>
<br>
SoT's problems and flames have no bearing on us nor are we them nor are we better/worse than they were, they are a memory, IMO our guild has the best of them amoungst our ranks and i am happy and proud to call them guildmates.  So you can take your analogy and to paraphrase Borick &quot;shove it where the sun don't shine&quot;<br>
<br>
So in Closing, Iniqy, go back to raiding the zones more suited to your ability, like East commons and North Ro.<br>
<br>
I am happy where i am, i enjoy the game emensely and quite frankly hardly ever noticed you or your guild in my 14 months on this server, tho i have met a few, decent folks from FK, a very nice cleric with cool gloves.  You can go do what ever ya want to, it does not effect me or my game or my friends.<br>

say what you want about NB zerging mobs bro, but just b/c FK does shit with 40 or less doesn't mean you have to hate on us.<br>

can we kill XTC, maybe, maybe not, but when we do i sure as hell hope we beat NB on their shot<br>

Lose one argument, so revert to personal attack and insult.  You're taking a page out of some dumbasses book, I'm sure.  <br>
<br>
Falconus is an asshole, yep.  What does this have to do with Karadin or Milambus?  I promise you that you will never have the opportunity to ask Falconus for a shot at a mob.<br>
<br>
The whole argument about 'zerging' mobs is a very slippery slope that I would suggest you not set yourself upon.  When BOTS killed their first AOW, do you think they did it with 40 people?  When Tindi killed Emperor...  oops, bad analogy... when Tindi killed Blood, do you think they did it with two groups?  Trust me, you're not the ninja assassin clan of supertards that you think you are.  Some nights Noble Blade kills mobs with 30-40 people.  On other lucky nights we have 50-60 people.  It all really depends on how many of us old fuckers get online.  Like I've said, we don't much care what another guild does, as long as they don't piss in our oatmeal.  Noble Blade isn't measuring penises with anyone.  We're just happy when our prostates let us pee.<br>
<br>
Even if we -were- impressed by your achievements, there's nothing for us to be jealous about.  If Noble Blade was going to be jealous of anyone, perhaps it would be BOTS, for doing everything first.  Perhaps we'd be jealous of Tindi, for having killed this mob or that mob before us.  But we aren't.  <br>
<br>
When you kill XTC, you won't 'beat' us to anything, because if it happens to be our turn for the mob, we'll just have that much less stress that night and get the mob next week when we're up for him.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I've know a lot of core nb and core fk people for the better half of 3 years.  All I have to say is that these people stick to their guilds.  There's always going to be guild pride no matter what guild someone is in.  <br>
<br>
Let's face it, we all care deeply for our guild and it's often hard to look at a situation from another's point of view.  What do we do about this?  How about hearing it from both point of views and the truth should fall some place in the middle of the two stories.<br>

With the caveat that both classes of people can fall into the additional category of:<br>

1) Informed<br>
2) Uninformed<br>

Competent people do what they are supposed to do. When they are uninformed about some particular issue, they learn as they do it, and then become informed about the issue and continue with their general competence.<br>
<br>
Incompetent people don't do what they are supposed to do, and when are informed about what they should be doing, continue to not do it.<br>
<br>
There are various levels of incompetence, there is only one level of competence.<br>

<br>
Let me sum this up for you Borick, since you weren't there and all.  I was there for the Cazic problem, and what REALLY happened was this:<br>
<br>
1) An FK member has a friend in the guild who was currently doing fear.  Through this friend we receive their blessing to enter the plane when they are done to do CT.<br>
<br>
2) FK begins to make plans to do this, a couple groups even zone in to fear as soon as the plane opens.  The rest of us had a bit of a miscarriage in WW (it's embarassing don't ask <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
3) Everything is going fine, when one of our guild leaders informs NB that we are heading to fear to do CT.  Karadin's first reply to that is something very much to the effect of &quot;You can't get on CT rotation when you are not booked for the plane&quot;<br>
<br>
4) FK is completely thrown off by this.  Out of respect for the RTA and the benefit of the doubt that was given to Karadin, over half the guild is instantly of the stance of &quot;Well I'm not doing anything against the RTA no way am I going to fear&quot;.  Mass /gu bickering ensues over this.<br>
<br>
5) Meanwhile, now that their porters have been given adequate notice, the NB logged on at the time (which did not happen to include you apparently, Mr. Righteous) kicks on /anon and starts appearing in fear. As Wrenfield pointed out, being one of the ppl already in fear, we SAW IT HAPPEN.  Or maybe you were going to do CT with &lt; 20 people cuz thats all that my /who would show from Western Wastes.<br>
<br>
6) After further questions from various people, Karadin concedes that well its not really a rule that you have to have the plane booked and CT be up for you to get on rotation.  That is just kinda how it always happened to ppl.  What a cute anecdote, I am glad he shared it!  Kar isn't a liar, he just wasn't specific as to the nature of his initial comment.<br>
<br>
I'm not gonna hate on you guys, cuz fact is you outsmarted us.  You won the race with your brain, you have a helluva clever leadership that makes good use of the respect of other guilds for its stand on issues.  Now get your hearsay shit outta my face Borick, you are an insult to arrogant asshole clerics all over the world. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18121">Baysar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

if its the time i think it is that you are referring to a mage was dared to try and out run KT with SoE and he did which happened to kill a few people but we CR'd them pretty quickly after this.

Abaz, you were right in you post, there are two types of players but just so you know there are those who lag and even if they know what/how to do what they are doing sometime they are fucked by the fact that their LAN blows ass and it makes them look like a shitty player.<br>

ok my response is your a dumbass liar!  Ok lets say that your telling the truth and there were over 20 NB on as is commonly the case.  thats all well and good if you happened to see any in fear you would have been lucky... WHY YOU ASK!!! HERES WHY!!!  in the same quote and in others!!!<br>

so in conclusion lay the fuck off SoT who was a great guild and is gone, do you make fun of your dead best friend or a dead family member?  And for FK you guys are pretty nice but i think a couple people are poorly stating what happened.  As for NB i think Borick said it like you guys NEED CT, hes not worth a huge argument. I dont think FK should have been mislead on how to get on the rotation especially for cazic it just is mindboggling and makes you guys looks like loot whores who get off on trying to hold another guild back, or maybe just this particular guild. <p>&lt;br&gt;Dastante Soulsaver &lt;br&gt;60 High Priest<br>

Retard.<br>
<br>
And what is so out of sequence about what I said?  I'm talking about a good 20-30 minutes of confusion over this, during which some FK who had already gone to fear were watching the NB start to trickle in.  About 5-10 minutes after we tipped our hand, the people in fear start telling /gu, &quot;NB people showing up&quot; <br>
<br>
Maybe I confused you by saying &quot;the NB logged on at the time&quot; when I meant &quot;the NB who were logged on at the time&quot;.  I am not sayin they called up their guildies on the fone and said come kill CT <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And don't even start the bullshit of who NEEDs what.  First off, FK had (until last night) never killed CT, and go figure its a game and we like doing new things.  Sorry for having ambition.  As for loot, I am sure that after a year of more powerful guilds farming him, those guilds consider his drops to be average or crap - but they are new to us.  Don't assume of what we NEED, because you have no fucking clue.  Neither does Borick.  And if CT is so ho-hum to NB, why did they even make an issue of it at all?  Why aren't they on autopass on the rotation if they have so many better things to do?  <br>
<br>
Btw its you're not your. Why can't people fawking learn that. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18121">Baysar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
