<br>
Although it has been explained why scales are not to be rolled on just by classes the need them for epics (the way most other guilds do it). Doing it any other way has got problems that really need addressing, I mentioned this too Komisar during Vox but obviously it wasnt the time or the place.....<br>
<br>
If you are too let all classes roll on scales they are gonna be laughing all over the place, not sure on exact PC's but i know basically both red and white scales can be sold in EC in seconds for 100k+ i personnaly know one bard willing to pay 150k cash for white scale.<br>
<br>
Now.... the items that these scales make are somewhere in range of 20-40k right (again not 100% but thats what i told prices where)...<br>
<br>
This may make me sound like some kind of loot whore but if i had a scale worth 100k im sure as hell i anit gonna turn it into a 20k cloak / BP, What i wud do and what most other people with half a brain wud do ( u may denie it but u know u wud, u be a fool not to) is go to EC sell it, with the money buy the cloak / BP then have about 60kpp left i bank. Or use the full pp from scale and buy some of the cloak / BP that are out there that make them look like newbie rags.<br>
<br>
However turning these items into epics is a whole new story, whos gonna not want to have there epic ?<br>
<br>
As for what u were saying about CoG never doing epics i bet if this Kunark dragons thing takes off, CoG can start doing BIG things as the signup wont be resrticted to &lt; 53<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts plz relpy and let me know what u think<br>
<br>
P.S. One more idea on how to even it up (just an other idea) if this is to work the people needing scale cant have it both ways they shud not get to roll on any of the other items they can use even if they loose on the sclae, to make it fairer on the other classes.<br>
<br>
So for for example CoF drops and Red Scale u choose which one u get to roll on B4 they are rolled<br>
<br>
plz reply with feedback thanks <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueqkommisar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eqkommisar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Can-Head</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(8/24/01 9:08:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.chrometiger.com/~anubis/stuff/canhead.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Revised Vox Strategy and loot rules *please read*</span><hr size=1> Actually, red scales aren't worth that much.  Most guilds and alliances on KGC have mentioned that they tend to have way too many red scales, and not enough green and white scales.  Go figger.<br>
<br>
As for people not wanting to make the armor with the scale because the scale is worth so much more... you are assuming that all CoG raiders basically sell the loot they win.  This is a false premise.<br>
<br>
Also, CoG is not the only group that allows non-epic classes to roll (and win) scales from Naggy and Vox.<br>
<br>
Now that we have a couple facts straight, let us begin a discussion about CoG vs epics:<br>
<br>
As I've said before, the KCoG is not a good place to get an epic weapon.  If that is your only intent, do yourself a favor and join an uber-guild or larger alliance that is capable of helping you get it.<br>
<br>
One of the main reasons I'm opposed to limiting scale rolls to only those classes who need them for epics is that there are members of those larger guilds and alliances that come on CoG raids... and well, I don't wanna make CoG raids a great place for epic-hunters to tag along just because it'll give them more chances to get what they need.  That is not the kind of person I want to attract to our raids.<br>
<br>
No one, as of yet, has seriously complained about our rolls on red scales (probably because the red scale seems to be so much more common).  So basically this discussion ends up being strictly about white scales from Vox... which are pretty rare.<br>
<br>
I have many a time considered limiting scale rolls to epic classes alone... the main problem I have with rules and policies like that is that they get away from the purpose of the KCoG.  We are not here to get epic weapons for everyone, we are not here to get planes armor for everyone, we are not here to let uber-guilders &quot;double-dip&quot; for rare items, we are, in short, NOT ABOUT THE LOOT.  We are about giving people who would not otherwise have a chance the opportunity to go places and see things they wouldn't normally have.<br>
<br>
Which is why discussions about who should get to roll on what tend to piss me off.  Because they are basically about squabbling over loot.  And that's not why I run these raids.  These kinds of discussions, in fact, are the thing that I hate most about running these raids.  Which is why, in general, I tend to follow the KCoG's overall loot policy:<br>
<br>
If you bleed for it and can use it, you can roll for it.<br>
<br>
So... here's where my thinking is right now:<br>
<br>
Limiting who rolls on the white scales tends to encourage loot-hunters to come to our raids alone, thus giving them the best chances at winning it.  This runs counter to everything that the KCoG is about.<br>
<br>
The cloak, as unlikely as it may be that someone would actually make it, is actually pretty good gear for almost any class.  It's good AC for a back slot item, has nice Int/Wis, and has very nice cold resistance.  So, under CoG's normal loot rules, everyone gets to roll.<br>
<br>
Now think about this: If you are a guild-member of good standing and/or you have lots of friends in the game (like a certain un-guilded, sexless drood <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and one of your guild-mates or friends wins something that you need for your epic... chances are pretty good yer gonna get it in the end, right?<br>
<br>
So, here's where I'm going with this:  Opening up the scale rolls to everyone (maybe even the red scale?) would encourage folks that need the scale for their epic to try and bring as many friends and guild-mates as possible to CoG raids - this giving them more chances to &quot;win&quot; the scale in the end... sorta like buying more than one raffle ticket... the more people you bring, the more chances you get.<br>
<br>
That way, rather than encouraging people to come alone, we'd be encouraging people to come with a posse!  THAT is the kind of policy I like!<br>
<br>
So what's everyone think about that?<br>
<br>
Addendum: Paladin books will continue to be Paladin only - they're no drop and I don't wanna encourage multi-questing items on that scale...  besides, if I was going to make any chances in the Paly book policy it would be to &quot;Kommisar gets the next book Nagafen drops.

<br>
I trust the people I raid with.  I dont know many of them, but to be fair many dont know me.  Yet they entrust me with their equipment and experience hoping that I know what I'm doing.  All in the name of having a good time.  I think its only fair that everyone therefore have as good a chance as anyone else to potentially get whatever they want.<br>
<br>
The potential for abuse is evident, that is true.  But part of the spirit of KCoG has been to trust and believe in others.  Yes, I know its possible for people to sell the white scale.  Its also possible for them to sell the eyepatch or a cof.  We know it happens, I've seen both for sale in EC.  Yet that doesnt matter.  I know I prefer to believe in the best in people rather than assume the worst.  I may constantly be setting myself up for disappointment and hurt feelings, but occasionally I find someone who cares that makes up for it.<br>
<br>
And as far as use, the white dragonscale cloak is one of the best cloaks a druid can get.  Sure, there are several awesome pieces out of ToV that are better, but most of us will never see those.  So what is more important?  A scale going to a epic quest that may or may not ever be completed and used in a CoG raid, or a scale going to a cloak that may or may not be sold and may help save both the life of the wearer and make them useful to both CoG and their groups in the future?  Of course this is a loaded question, there is no right answer since it all depends on where your looking at.<br>
<br>
One thing to consider.  If you dont like the loot rules you can of course always post here to try to change it.  This may or may not work.  But, there are other options.  You can begin to actually lead these raids.  You lead a Planar raid, you set the loot rules.  You lead a dragon raid, you set the loot rules.  Of course, if you start really restricting the loot dont expect a lot of people to show up since CoG is not an alliance and is not mandatory.  However, the option is always there.  I'm always looking for people to back me up and I'm sure Kommisar wouldnt mind someone to take the occasional raid to reduce his stress level.<br>

If a scale drops in tonights Vox raid, and i'm there with my bard, I'd feel REALLY guilty if only bards were allowed to roll on the scale because of epic concerns.  Why?  cause there is no way in hell i'd keep it for Steps.  I'd much rather either turn it in for a cloak for Zondro or ecBay it for like 100k.<br>
<br>
It's silly to give white scales to only bards, why? cause to complete the epic you need to be able to drop trak.  If you can drop trak, you can prolly drop gore.  And gore drops white scales a LOT.<br>
<br>
Red scales are the same way.  Talendor is a joke, easily dropped by under 30 people.  So basically, the scales are just an item that certain people use for an epic, while other people use for a BP or cloak.  Yes, if an int caster wins the white scale they will probably sell it and buy a heiro cloak and have cash left over, but you cant let tanks roll on a white scale without letting a caster roll on a CoF.<br>
<br>
basically just pretend everybody is nice honest peoples and wont be selling anything, if an item only seems good for bards and casters lets bards and casters roll, if it only seems good for tanks only let tanks roll.<br>
<br>
If a white scale drops, I'm rolling on it, knowing that MOST of the other people rolling are in the same boat <p>-Zondro Devvildoll

<br>
(1) Do bards count as melee for purposes of rolling for the RBB?  Some guilds have a history of not letting bards roll for haste items because they have their own built-in haste (song).  Not a big deal to me either way, I'd just like to know in advance.<br>
<br>
(2) Do you expect bards to be in there with weapons melee-ing, or using instruments to maximize effectiveness of resist songs? (I punch for up to 7 whole points of damage while using my Selo's drum <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  Or does it depend on the quality of instrument they've got? <p><b><font face="Verdana"  size=-1>Nerissa Goldenrose<br><i>The Chosen Ones</i></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueqkommisar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eqkommisar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Can-Head</span><br> <font color=#8E9173>(10/2/01 3:11:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fcouncilofguildsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=148.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.chrometiger.com/~anubis/stuff/canhead.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Revised Vox Strategy and loot rules *please read*</span><hr size=1> 1) Bard can roll on haste items (if they haven't already won an instrument on the same raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) as they are considered a melee class.<br>
<br>
2) However, Bards are grouped with the high end tank groups and are expected to play resistance songs (among others at their discretion) to keep the tanks in their group alive as long as possible, allowing them to do as much damage as possible and keep as much taunt on them (and off the casters and healers) as possible.<br>
<br>
We don't tend to get many bards, usually only 1 or 2.  While Bards <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>can</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> do decent melee damage, raising the groups resistances to like 190+ (and thus allowing the lv49+ Warriors in their group to last much longer) seems to be a more effective use of the class.<br>
<br>
The survivability of tanks grouped with a Bard is much higher from my experience.  If the Bard didn't play resistance songs, this would not be the case.  And as I've said many times, keeping tanks alive as long as possible is the way to kill dragons... as long as there are tanks alive, there is a chance to win. <p>-Kommisar Nils "Can-Head" Hansen -- Guild Officer.

<br>
Anyway, keeping the tanks alive is first and foremost the most important thing in a dragon raid.  While I will grant you that they may or may not be doing the bulk of the damage, without the tanks the casters are dead meat.  If Vox or Naggy aggro's on a caster then they are usually dead before they can even move.  Dead caster means less damage being done.<br>
<br>
Also tanks with bash and kick and melee attacks have a chance at stunning Vox.  While dragons dont get stunned the way most mobs do, they can be inturrupted.  If you are short on enchanters to mana sieve her, inturrupts are very important.<br>
<br>
So anything that keeps the tanks alive is good.  If you lose all the tanks, I dont care how far down Vox or Naggy is in hps, you will probably lost the raid.  As long as the tanks are up and running you'll probably win.  So bards are very very necessary and needed and wanted for this.  Anyone who says otherwise needs a crash course in Dragon raiding.<br>

But you are still very marginal even if the enchanter is 52.<br>
<br>
Certainly they can stand farther away.  I believe Mana Sieve is one of the few spells that can be cast at max distance from Vox and still take effect.  However, they are still suseptable to Fear.  A feared enchanter is a useless enchanter and if they are feared even 50 percent of the time, they're not casting for that period.  Also, even if they are never feared, they can only cast 1 spell at a time.<br>
<br>
The reason for failure against Vox isnt combat power or resists or even fear.  The reason for failure against Vox is that she Complete Heals.  Pretty much the only reason.  Which of course is why you have enchanters.  But you almost are required to have multiple ones so that there is always at least 1 casting mana sieve or theft of thought at all times, preferably all of them.  It'll take between 4-5 of them generally to sieve her mana.  And if these fights arent over within a minute or so you'll once again probably lose because she'll have killed enough tanks that your casters are again dead meat when she Cheals.<br>
<br>
Bottom line.  No enchanters and I'll give you maybe a 10percent chance at success.  For each enchanter after that you can add about 20-25 percent up to 3.  Past 3 and I dont think they'll add much more than simply accelerate an already fast happening event.  One enchanter certainly can do the job.  However, it is not so great a margin that delaying the raid an hour for an additional enchanter or two isnt worthwhile.<br>

I was at the last Vox raid and I really liked some of the tactics. Having a group go and clear out the IGs before hand was a great idea, as was having a high level task force doing the Buff line. That being said, I was at the end of the buff line and by the time i got to the end my Shammy buffs were already flashing. So, here is my suggestion.<br>
Since most groups (if not all) will usually have at least one buffer in the group have them do the first &quot;throw away buffs&quot;. All that should remain for the Buff Line (for Tanks at least) is:<br>
cleric HP/Symbol Buffs; RM/RC Buffs (can be done either by cleric/Shammy/druid I believe with Druid being the best option due to Circle of X - should one or two of high enough level be around); and finally Haste Buffs from the chanter. I think this could greatly accelerate the Buff Line process...<br>

You may get feared for a step or 2 with 60 mr at level 48 but its minimal.<br>
<br>
A few other tips.<br>
<br>
1) If you have a lot of druids show up send several of the higher level extras in as a group to /assist Lady Vox and heal the one being eatten.<br>
<br>
2) If you have several 50+ tanks then tell the &lt;48 to not taunt as they will have enough of a problem just staying alive/unfeared.<br>
<br>
3) Bards mem that Desperate Durge spell so if all of your party gets killed and you're nearly dead let loose for a &quot;last great act of defiance ;o&quot;.<br>
<br>
4) If you have a low level &quot;little brother&quot; that tags along let them hold malechite/bones for Mage/Necro pet summons after they get toasted.<br>
<br>
5) To pin the dragon in the back of the lair do NOT attack it but run by to the back of the lair.  You will not get summoned until the dragon takes a certain amount of HP damage.  Until then you can lead it around.  ps. If your running the raid and also trying to pin the dragon back in the lair make hot keys with /shout Wave 2 attack! etc. or you may solo Naggy for 2 minutes before you remember...um.. no real basis in anything that's ..um.. ever occured before ;o. <p>Perciful Pellinore<BR>

For the casters, when you need to go suicide cuz you are oom, use a low level DD spell to draw her attention and kill you as quick as possible. Something low cost of course because you will be oom or more correctly you will be very low on mana and the idea is to get yourself killed as quickly as possible. It may sound crazy but if everyone is doing there job well then getting Vox's attention so she can kill you isn't as easy as it sounds. The low level DD, preferably fire based if you have one, should do the trick. <br>
   Second suggestion is this. As a caster, if you are like me, you always have gate memmed with the exception of those times when you might have an Evac if you are a druid or Wz memed in your gate slot. Well this is one time you dont want to have gate memed. The last thing you want to do, after the raid is over without regard to it's success, is to gate back to the buff line area accidentaly. Trust me, I've done it and it could have been disasterous if I and the few raiders left hadnt reacted quickly and carefully to get me out of an ugly death loop. ( thanks again Azure and steelheart). Thats all and happy Dragon hunting.<br>
