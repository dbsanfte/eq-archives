<br>
Can anyone please explain how the Rhag's are worked in SSRA?  <br>
<br>
Last night CE decided to go to SSRA and check out the zone.  Our goals for the night were to engage and kill Rhag'Zhezum if he was up and to obtain a few shissar bane weapons.<br>
<br>
Upon zoning in we found 2 members of another guild in SSRA and us.  One of them asked in say &quot;Is Circles End here for Rhag 1&quot;?  I replied yes if hes up we would like to give him a try.  Well we were forming up yet and waiting for a few straglers.  Mind you we had over 18 in zone at this time.  <br>
<br>
About 2 minutes later it was asked again &quot;Is Circles End here for Rhag 1&quot;  I said back &quot;Yes if he is up we are going to give him a try&quot;  and I told the trackers to check for him.  It was then brought up in say, how can you go after him if you don't know that he is up?  I replied our trackers are checking atm.  It was then stated.....&quot;Well I tell you what......I will invis and race you to him.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I thought well that is kinda fucking cheap.  So we finished forming up and cleared to Rhag 1 room.  Upon opening the door there was 5 people there from this other guild.  I saw the person that said they would race me invis to Rhag 1 there.  So I asked in tells, &quot;why are you here? You knew that we were coming for him?????&quot;  and I was told....&quot;Ohhh I didnt know that you were coming for him&quot;....<br>
<br>
Now how the hell couldn't you know this when I told you 3 times that we were and you even said you were going to race us (invis) to him?  <br>
<br>
Then I was told......&quot;The first guild to have a person in the room can claim camp to him&quot;  and was also told &quot;Let me talk to the guild officers and ask them what to do.&quot;  So I waited and a few min later asked again and was told they were still talking about it.  During this time, more and more from this guild are zoning in and running there invis. <br>
<br>
It was then told to me after asking a few more times, &quot;well we have to many here or in route and it would be to difficult to turn them around now so we are going to engage him and we have the right because some of us was in his room first&quot;  I asked &quot;Isnt Rhag a first to come with enough force mob?&quot; and was told &quot;well you can try and race us here....(I looked over my shoulder at the 20 plus people behind me in the room adjacent to Rhag1)  but there isnt any bad blood between guild (x) and CE......&quot;  <br>
<br>
Now instead of getting super pissed at the time I decided, ok we will back off on this and I would come and ask here what the rules were on Rhag since it was our first time there.  <br>
<br>
Can a guild just run 1 person to his room invis and claim the Rhag if hes up?  Is that how you all work it in SSRA?  <br>
<br>
I think what irrated me the most though was even after we were ready to give him a shot we moved on to the basement and over a hour later Rhag 1 was still up........<br>
<br>
Would like some imput though from the guilds that do SSRA on the Rhags<br>

<br>
Rhag1 does not drop shissarbane weapons.  Anyways, Rhag1 is far far too easy and easy to access to be put on a rotation.  He could be killed with the right 6 man group.  <br>
<br>
Unless at some point the RTA decides to put this mob on a rotation, which I'd be willing to bet that they wont, treat this as a mob where the first person to engage is the first person to have &quot;rights&quot; to the mob.  This is what Verant goes by as far as I know.<br>
<br>
So in other words, if they asked you if you were going to try and you said yes and they THEN went in invised up, but haven't engaged him and you have 18+, go ahead and down him and laugh at them for being disrespectful. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shogonramel>Shogon Ramel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/23/02 10:40:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.t-online.de/home/520013139003-001/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: SSRA and Rhag'Zhezum</span><hr size=1> Oh yeah I forgot to answer this question you had.<br>

<br>
Heh, no they can not run 1 person into the room invis and claim the rhag.  You may or may not say f that 1 person and just go in and attack him.  Technically, they could have 36 people in the room just sitting there and as long as they haven't engaged you could even run over them then too since this is not a rot mob, but that would be pretty disrespectful on your part.  Anyways, hope I shed some light. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roggulbuk>Roggulbuk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The new Admin in Town</span><br>  Posts: 1004<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(11/23/02 10:40:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=857.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: SSRA and Rhag'Zhezum</span><hr size=1> Man, that was a nice bunch of people, whoever it was.
