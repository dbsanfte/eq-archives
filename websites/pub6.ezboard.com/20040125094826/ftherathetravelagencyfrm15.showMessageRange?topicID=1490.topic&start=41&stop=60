You self centered egotistical piece of trailer trash that even Jerry Springer wouldn't buttfuck.  Now you may have a girlfriend, and yes she may be hot, but that doesn't mean she isn't dumb as fuck for going out with you, or hell, dumb as fuck in general.  And honestly why would you think I would waste my precious time going around asking all your trailer trash gang if your girlfriend is hot?  Example of conversation<br>
<br>
Seredoff : Hey Vic's friend is his girlfriend hot?<br>
Big Bubba: Suwre is boy.  Man I saw her a whoopin and a hollerin runnin from dat der dog over yonder.  She was da perdest thing I ever did see.  Now I have to go jack up ma momma's trailor cause it be crooked.  <br>
Vic: See I told you she was hot, I told you didn't I , now Im gonna go make a photo shop of her.  Then Im gonna jerk off to it, then Im gonna make another photo shot of smoke coming out of my mouth so people over the Internet think I'm cool.<br>
<br>
And enough with your insults involving male fluid.  It seems to me that you dream about that shit day in and day out.  We all know you wish your girlfriend had a penis, or maybe she does?? Better check that one out Vic.  Now I got some instructions you can follow for me.  And yes this part of the flame got inspiration from Foamy<br>
1) Take your eq cd<br>
2) snap it in half<br>
3) slit your wrists<br>
4) wait and die<br>
Think you can do that for me? I believe in you and so does the rest of this forum.  We all believe you can do that, because you are soooo damn cool.  I mean you smoke whatever it is you smoke then post a picture trying to brag about it...  Now I know this flame will do no good, because you'll come back with some kind of jizz stained teeth joke, a gay joke, or maybe a photo shop if Im lucky, but no matter what you do, I will always know that you have a sad, shallow, pathetic life that will never amount to anything.  Now that is something that brings a smile to my face, the fact that I know I have purpose, and ADHD center of attention wannabe's like yourself do not. <br>

If you &quot;used&quot; to do something, your skills are getting rusty and you lose physical prowess and your timing isn't as sharp and your endurance depletes. Training like a workhorse is the only way to keep your skills honed. <br>

He only has pictures of himself Drache.  He cuts her out of all the 'couple' pictures they have.  Can't have her sullying the picture and all.  <br>

You are one dumbfucked piece of shit you know that?  Are you fucking color blind?  Are you that fucking insecure of yourself that you have to try to PROVE to yourself that you are better looking then the general population?<br>
<br>
Listen fuckwit.  My hair is B R O W N.  DARK FUCKING BROWN.  Were you the result of a loud and obnoxious slimy pussy fart that somehow developed into the egocentric cocksucker, which you have so obviously deemed yourself today?  How hard is it to see my hair is Brown......fucking brown.  It completely boggles my brain that you can't comprehend a basic color.  Another thing shitstick, my hair isn’t curly, it's as straight as you can get it.  In no way do I resemble a &quot;carrot top&quot; you fucking indigent bastard.  <br>
<br>
Does it make you feel special that you have a Girlfriend?  Guess what?  I have one too.  Do I go around talking about her to impress all my Internet friends?  No.  Because she is not a tool that I use to inflate my own ego and self-worth.  She is my companion, not my fuck toy, or my bragging rights.  I'm not even going to bother to tell you that she is pretty, because it doesn't matter, for your ignorant ass wouldn't believe it anyway.  It's a simple concept of how you value a relationship, and taken from face value from yours, you are a poor excuse of a partner, and a person.  You don't need a fucking girlfriend; all you need is a god damn mirror to be entranced all day.<br>
<br>
You see, fucktard, I don't judge people by their looks, unlike your shallow sorry ass, but by their personality.  I personally think you are self-centered, insecure, idiotic ass goblin that believes there is no greater person in the world but yourself.  I think any girl that would even consider tolerating you is as well, a shallow bitch who is probably only visiting her grandmother to insure she will get something when the old fuck croaks.  Seeing as how you base your Girlfriend by her looks and not who she is, I'm sure you have no real value of intimacy or emotion, because I can't see you loving anyone but yourself.  <br>
<br>
I think the only reason you're here is you THINK, and remember kids, this single digit I.Q. mindset, THINK, you are a big, strong jock who can swoop into the nerdy RTA boards and beat up on all of these pansy posters and show us who the true king is!  Well, you're quite wrong.  You are repetitive with your insults.  In two posts I saw the same insult twice (about wiping cum from your face, WOW, really original asshole), and your foundation of intelligence is equivalent to Stephen Hawking's performing Riverdance.  You may be big and bad and tough, but you're on a flame board, and you know how far that sub standard muscle structure will get you, about as far as you're going to go in life with your attitude, nowhere.  We people of the RTA are smarter then you and you are only looking more and more like a complete idiot.  You are a pathetic excuse of life.  To quote George Carlin, your mother should have had a medical plan which included abortion.  <br>
<br>
Your oxygen rights have been revoked.  Shut up and stop trying. <br>

I find it rather odd that you flaunt your girlfriend around like some kind of trophy, and brag about getting laid.  Grow the fuck up.  Having a girlfriend is more than just having someone to fuck everyso often, and yes I do have a girlfriend, but unlike you Ive only been going out with her for 7 months, which is no match for your mighty 4 years, but at least I have shown my the respect and love that she deserves.  I honestly feel sorry for your significant other, really I do, and if she saw what you posted on the internet, if she was any semblance of a self respecting woman, she would kick your ass to the curb for saying stupid shit like.  &quot;I get laid&quot; &quot;My girlfriend is hot&quot;........ all that says about you is that you're shallow.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#222222><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/btherathetravelagency.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mixylplix>mixylplix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#00FFFF>(12/4/03 1:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ftherathetravelagencyfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1490.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Picture Ideas</span><hr size=1> So if I say something off the wall will you make another 5 minutes picture?<br>

We could try this, &quot;Why not go sit on Bog's face and have a three way with Flabarr&quot;.<br>

There that ought to be a REALLY SICK image for you to work up.<br>
<br>
Honestly the pictures are good for the tool, but nothing cool about the smoke aspect of the first one.  That just left me kind of cold.  I am sure that your mind is already racing to create some thing good and sick from the image I gave you though so I will sit back and see what you pull up.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
#1  I have muscles.<br>
#2  I have a girlfriend.<br>
#3  I'm smart and you're all stupid.<br>
#4  You all sit around being fat at your keyboards playing Everquest.<br>
#5  I tossed a ball around before so i'm an athlete.<br>
#6  I'm uber artist, my friends told me so.<br>
#7  I used to box. I won't specify if I was trained by someone who can actually box, or if I just punched a bag over and over with boxing gloves on. But either way, i'm still a boxer.<br>

Just makes me want to scream &quot;No, asshole! You are trained in the art of pacing back and fourth in repeating patterns, throwing the same couple unimpressive punches and kicks into the air over and over while shouting the names of them in the Korean language for $50 a month!

I'm not going to say &quot;uh. No.  I don't do kung fu, I do repetitive training blah blah blah.&quot; I'm going to say I practice Kung Fu.<br>
<br>
But I see your point; I hate it when people claim to be &quot;a kung fu master&quot; or a &quot;karate master&quot; when they've done it for about a month and just know one or two ways to do a move, and have STOPPED because their lazy asses can't get to lessons.  <br>
<br>
Regardless of the fact I've been out of training for 3 weeks, but that was because I slammed my back.  Funny story, really.  Was dressed as a clown and slipped on a big puddle of water.  I've told this story before, I'm sure.<br>
