      <p class="detailsBold">Yes, stop reminding me.  Me = Slack.  Webupdate < Me trying to convince my wife that 
	the reason I can't cut the grass is because we're killing some fucking retarded AE blinding thing that makes her think i'm not really 
	even playing the computer anymore, just staring at a black screen.</p>
      <p>Let's get right to the fun shall we ?</p>
      <p><img src="/buffe/blindgate.jpg"> <img src="/buffe/gate2.jpg">sigh...</p>
      <p>Of course mobs dont like fighting 1 on 1, so he wanted to bring some friends.  <img
	src="/buffe/vtheals.jpg"></p>
      <p>Then we figure out the truth of wtf just hit us <img src="/buffe/badpull.jpg"><br></p>
      <p>One of the nice things about VT, is we finally have new places to push things to...<br> <img src="/buffe/stuck.jpg"></p>
      <p>And everyone learns a little bit more about their class. <img src="/buffe/rage.jpg"></p>
      <p>Of course there is always some miscommunication <img src="/buffe/bards1.jpg"> </p>
	<p>But once that miscommunication is understood, all is set straight
         <img src="/buffe/bards2.jpg"></p>
      <p> One of the big things i've learned, is don't fuck with The Druid Union... TDU has ways of getting back at you.  Need 
	  a port dear guildleader ?  </p>
	<p> The comfort...<img src="/buffe/tdu1.jpg"></p> <br>
	<p> The setup...<img src="/buffe/tdu2.jpg"> </p><br>
	<p> The execution...<img src="/buffe/tdu3.jpg"></p><br>
	<br>
      <p>I've also learned the The Mage Union is ruthless... <img src="/buffe/tmu.jpg"></p>
      <p>And TWU is like that guy at you're office who has it so good, yet complains about everything nonstop...<img src="/buffe/twu1.jpg">
      <p>Something is going on in The Cleric Union, but I can't quite figure it out yet.  When the plot is uncovered, I will be sure to let everyone know...
        <img src="/buffe/wolves.jpg"> <img src="/buffe/wolves2.jpg"> <img src="/buffe/wolves3.jpg"> <img src="/buffe/wolves4.jpg"> <img src="/buffe/wolves5.jpg"> <img src="/buffe/saroth.jpg"> <img src="/buffe/saroth1.jpg">
	</p>
      <p>Of course there is The Shamen Union,  but those guys are a bit wierd, and uhh scary  <img src="/buffe/steel.jpg"></p>
      <br>
      <p>Enough of that, we've been busy busy in Vex Thal, trying to convince everyone that AE blind is their friend, and TDU is their enemy.  We peeked our heads out of VT recently a bit to knock off 
	 another High Priest, AoW, Emperor Ssraeshza.  Emperor is on our farm club, we're hoping one day he'll be in the major leagues again.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sometimes my bank get's full, so I need to make room  <img src="/buffe/callerdes.jpg"> </p>
      <br>
      <p>We're thinking about just giving all our extra power sources to the newest up and coming guild on Innoruuk,<A href=http://meadbh.net/LoDaB>LoDaB</a>. I hear they are finally close to killing 
	 one of the easiest mobs in the high end game now <A href=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7830>Vyzh'dra the Cursed</a></p>
      <p>But no, sadly we won't team up with you to kill Emperor Ssraeshza, <img src="/buffe/oricalum-emp.jpg"> Sometimes you have to learn things on your own. Hmm, maybe i'm thinking of another guild, sorry for any confusion.</p>

        update jam packed with pics, loot, and maybe a classic ss quote. Well, 
        I don't have any of that! I took the time away from guildremoving car 
        crash victims and eating babies to bring you our latest in VT.</p>
      <p>We are doing very well and have a firm grip on the zone. I only wish 
        that if/when VI goes through to upgrade some of the items there (the ones 
        that suck and are unfit for even twinks) they put some sort of loot table 
        on the roamers. Plat, gems, ... I'd like to see quest armor slightly better 
        stat wise than ToV drop as a rare on the harder yard trash.</p>

      <p class="detailsBold">Named mobs have been falling to our feet dead in 
        droves, and one mob that has stood in our way is Thall Va Kelun. This 
        guy can give you a huge headache, and has given us lots of naked runs 
        back to VT. Well we clipped him down earlier this week. Tough, rewarding 
        fight.</p>

	  <p><span class="detailsBold">Visually the zone is stunning. About the only 
        thing I would change so far is the about of light in the first part of 
        the zone. Pretty much our learning experiences have involved finding creative 
        ways to train ourselves and then find even more creative ways to do CR 
        hopefully the kind of CR that does not involve coffins. We have had 3 
        really great trains that I can remember. These are the type of trains 
        where a few lucky people get insta-gibbed and get sent right to the bazaar, 
        while the rest of us die slow painful deaths while we vainly try and get 
        control of the situation. Here are the screen shots that I took: <a href=images/train1.gif>Train
