<p>Ashen spent the night in Plane of Tactics killing Tallon & Vallon.  Tallon went down fast like any ranger.  Vallons script bugged out and well we got no loot for killing him.  </p>

<p>Irongut is slackin (probably expin' like I should be doing), so I'm going to update this thing.</p>
<p>So last night we headed out to the Plane of Torment to kill the resident dominatrix goddess, Saryrn.  She is quite the S&M fanatic, spiked beds, cages, barbed sticks... and a bird.  The whole 9 yards, so to speak.</p>

<p>Anyway, after a glorious battle she ended up dead, as was the plan. The boss encounters in Planes of Power continue to impress me.  They're so much nicer than the 20 minute /afk fights in Vex and Ssra.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/saryrnbig.jpg"><img src="images/saryrnsmall.jpg" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Here's what she dropped:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/twinbladesorrow.jpg"><br><br><img src="images/capewithrunes.jpg"><br>

<br>

<p>Also, over the weekend we killed a few mobs in Tactics basement, like that 7k rampaging ogre and a guy that dropped this beast of a weapon:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/tragsword.jpg"><br><i>the Elf fears no evil, for he carries a big sword...</i><br><br>these are the stats:<br><br><img src="images/splitblade.jpg"><br><br>And before you ask, No, I wont sell it to you.</p>

<p>The Plane of Tactics. With all the ogres there, you'd think I'd be calling 
it my second home. Well, I'm really starting to dig it. Not for the hospitality. 
Its a bad ass zone. You can't slack one second. Hell, its hard enough just to 
keep curious people from killing us all while we are getting ready:</p>

<p>After going around the place for awhile, we ran into Rallos Zek's Kids. Tallon 
and Vallon, the name sakes of EQ's emptiest servers. These are not chumps though, 
and instead of calling you a gimp bluebie, they give your guild a beat down. After 
a few wipeouts the night before, we were determined to kill us some Demigods.</p>
<p>The first fight was Tallon Zek Ubah Ranger (yes, they exist!). Very fun fight, 
I must say I'm very impressed by this expansion's boss fights.</p>

<p align="left">Only dropping one of these two brothers is a waste. So, off we 
went to do battle with Vallon.We got him our first try (unusual thus far in PoP 
due to the varied nature of fights) and was he ever a handful. Kudos on this kill 
guys =)</p>

<p align="left">Need to say this again, the fights in PoP are nothing short of 
great. I have so much fun, even when we get our asses handed to us. Sorry to have 
to go so soon, but I will leave you with this out of context nugget of wisdom:</p>

First of all, no, this is not our new web site. I have changed the style sheet 
and formatting, but the new site will be going up on another server sometime in 
the near future. One thing that <b><i>IS</i></b> working is our new members section. 
Just click the link above to check it out.</p>
<p>Well, where to start. For one, I have to give credit to the devs at Sony Online 
for releasing, IMHO, the best EQ expansion. The rollout was without major incident, 
and not the massive bug- laden pos that was known as Shadows of Luclin. I have 
a few minor gripes though.</p>
<p>For one, the Devs need to address zone stability after boss-type mobs are defeated. 
We have had NightmareB and Plane of Disease crash multiple times after killing 
the bosses, effectively rolling back the loot and whatnot. Frustrating, but looks 
like it wouldn't be hard to solve.</p>
<p>Also, I know where you guys were going by disallowing COTH in some zones. Don't 
disable them completely in zones, just certain parts (ala Ssra temple) because 
not having coth in an EXP zone is absolutely stupid. I'm not fighting my group 
all the way back to the zone because a member our our exp group had to leave. 
</p>
<p>On to the good stuff. I'm having a blast raiding some of these places. There 
is allot of content too, coupled with high end zones from previous expansions 
there is elbow room to spare. I don't see a reason why guilds should feel the 
pinch and race each other (unless there is one friggen mob or zone with all the 
best loot we haven't seen yet, I friggen hope not).</p>
<p>The fights are quick and lethal, none of the 20 minute+ marathon endurance 
contests (at least not yet). This is good. A fight should be about strategy and 
tactics, and not on counting to 3 or pressing defensive.</p>
<p>We once again took out Terris Thule. The loot is fair, at least for us, but 
for lower tier guilds that will see her the loot will be great.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/11-3/terris_thule1.jpg" width="400" height="417"><br>
-Before-</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/11-3/terris_thule2.jpg" alt="Terris Thule, dead again" width="400" height="482"><br>
-After-</p>
<p>After more exp and exploring, we figured out how to enter this gem of a zone, 
Plane of Torment:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/11-3/torment_1.jpg"><img src="images/11-3/torment_thm1.jpg" alt="Plane of Torment" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>
-Great zone design here-<br>
<br>
<a href="images/11-3/torment_3.jpg"><img src="images/11-3/torment_thm3.jpg" alt="More Torment" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>
-Moonhaven enjoys the view-<br>
<br>

-Some of the locals-<br>
<br>
<img src="images/11-3/unimaginable_horror.jpg" width="400" height="334"><br>
-AV encounters a boss mob-</p>
<p>Torment is a nifty zone that we will be seeing much more of in the coming days. 
So is this all we have been up too? Of course not!</p>
<p>There are many other zones to raid. In the plane of disease we met up with 
Grummus, and preceded to kill him. Killed him a few times, because the zone crashed 
before we could hand loot out or figure out what the heck was up. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/11-3/grummus.jpg" alt="Fat!" width="400" height="286"><br>
-Looks ready for an exam of some sort-</p>
<p>Another zone we have been smashing through is the Crypt of Decay. Having fun 
exploring this zone:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/11-3/war_chief.jpg" alt="Rats!" width="400" height="323"><br>
-Payback for killing rats as a n00b-<br>
<br>

-More Fat guys-<br>
<br>
<a href="images/11-3/train_2.jpg"><img src="images/11-3/train_thumb.jpg" alt="Train" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>
-Avhi Escron says &quot;Hi AV Necros!&quot;-<br>

-Av vs High Priest Ultor Szanvon-<br>
<br>
<img src="images/11-3/mob_quote.gif" width="319" height="41"></p>
<p>All in all, a very fun first 2 weeks of this expansion. Sure, the loot is rather 
weak, but I feel the loot is good for up and coming guilds that most of these 
encounters are designed for.</p>
<p>More to come, stay tuned!</p>
