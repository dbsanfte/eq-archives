<p>We are on a roll. Night one, we off Xegony and Fennin. Night two, we take
  out Mystical Arbitor so we can go play with The Rathe. Night three, it was
  time to take a swim down to zap Coirnav. We figured, why not, lets kill 'em
  all in three nights. He has evaded us long
enough!</p>
<p>This is a tricky encounter, and the margin for error is quite small. We've
  had him down a good deal before only to see a loss. Not tonight, everything
  clicked, everyone stepped it up and The Avatar of Water was sunk.</p>

 <p>I'm here to toss up a new update for the sake of putting something current
   up, even if I don't have anything major to post. Corinav continues to (barely)
   elude us, and Sony changes Plane of Earth just about every week. Seems like
   they fixed it this time,
   the Mystical Arbitor of Earth is going to get dropped. </p>
 <p>Every thing else has been cake. We nailed Fennin the other night without
   loosing a single person. They should have given him an upgrade along with
   the mini-bosses in Fire. Next time we are going to fight him while under the
   influence just for a challenge.</p>

At long last, the fruits of creating a strategy  to
  defeat a tough encounter pays off. Xegony, Queen of Air is by far the hardest
  EQ encounter
  we have faced
  and defeated.
  Just getting to her spawn location was hard, but the fight itself is one of
  the reasons to play EQ... Its exciting: The whole fight you are not sure if
  you will win or loose.
  <p>After many frustrating battles, she was finally put down. The entire guild
  takes part and everyone was masterful. The margin for error is almost nothing
  with her; yet Ashen Vendetta triumphs tonight. Very tough, very fun and the
    whole encounter has a massive pucker factor.</p>
  <p>We have two Elemental Deities
      dead, and we'll soon add number 3. I hope you all like sushi.</p>  <p align="center"><img src="images/3-13-03/xegony%202.jpg" width="500" height="330"></p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/3-13-03/nadi.jpg" width="255" height="365"></p>
  <p align="left">Xegony has taken up a considerable amount of our time, as has
  flagging members who have been away and new recruits. On top of that we've
    put down a host of other named in just about every zone. It isn't exactly
    worthy of an update, but we are chugging along just fine towards Plane of
    Time. It is nice to kill mobs without relying on spoilers.</p>
  <p align="left">Until next time and remember to support our troops!</p></td>

out of the elementals more than makes up for the craptastic stuff you'll get
working your way up. Some of the encounters are easy, many are very hard but
fun. Plane of Water is turnnig out better with time (even though being a melee
under water sucks), Air is quite a challenging zone (more than Fire) and Plane
  of Earth is one giant brown stain.</p>
<p align="left">We are fairly close to clearing Air, and Water soon after. I
doubt you'll be seeing any guild clearing Earth until Sony redoes it. It sucks
  that bad for raiding. Until next time!</p>

<p>Fennin Ro evaded us one more time since my last update.  We took what we learned and went back and tried again.  Yes you heard it here, We didn't need to beg for strategies in cross server channels.  We didn't need to read full spoilers on the safe house.  Here in AV we charge, sort the bodies out, then kick ass and take names after OMG coming up with our own strategy.<br><br>

<p>Pushing forward is what Ashen Vendetta is about.  2.5 months after the Planes of Power was released, We finally have found the rewards of killing everything that gets in our way.  The first 3 tiers in PoP are filled with some new style encounters from the old turn auto attack on and go surf porn for half an hour, then come back and collect loots.  Yes indeed tiers 1-3 are filled with these new encounters, but they offered us nothing in reward for killing them except the line of text some chick in POK reads back to you.</p>
<p>FINALLY, We zoned into Plane of Fire and found a zone that rewards us for all that we have done up to this point in POP.  Let me say, that Plane of Fire is one of the best zones I have ever been in.  Verant has done an excellent job on this zone.  The encounters make you think, The Fennin Script is one of the best I have seen so far.  And rewarding the zone is, Excellent loot off the bosses.<br><br>

<p>Well hello, it feels like I haven't done one of these in forever. I won't waste 
this opportunity, I promise to bring you some brand spanking new updates. Here 
we go...</p>
<p>After the rekilling of most flag giving mobs (well, the hard ones---RZ, Bert, MM) the guild
has moved down into the depths of Plane of Water, Plane of Earth and even checking out Plane of Air.<br><br>
<center>
<p><img src="images/1-22-03/po_water.jpg" width="500" height="444"><br>
<br>
<i>Unless you haven't heard already, Plane of Water sucks. <br>
Two, count them 1--2--Paladin 1 Handers of a named that is badass. WTF?<br>
Well, we did get one of these off yard trash:</i></p>
<p><i><img src="images/1-22-03/coral_headed_mace.gif" width="514" height="206"></i> 
<br>
</p>
</center></p>
<p>I can't say I'm too impressed by either plane of Water or Earth. Water is, well, full of water and
for that very reason its going to be a huge pain in the nads to get anything done there. Hey Sony, remember Kedge?
Oh, and all the events in Plane of Earth are broken. Stop spamming chat every 5 minutes that we can get more 
bank slots for 17.99 and fix all the broken shit in PoP. F' Frogloks.<br><br>
<center><img src="images/1-22-03/vince.jpg"><br><br>
<i>Ironic?</i></center></p>
<p>That leaves us with Plane of Air and Plane of Fire. PoA, haven't been there 
yet but I have been to Plane of Fire. To get there we had to make one small detour 
to Solusek Ro's Tower and fight, well, Solusek Ro. I thought I got a Screenshot 
of him, but he died too fast. Perhaps a guildmate will be so kind as to scrounge 
one or two up. He did have these goodies:</p>

<img src="images/1-22-03/gaunts.gif" width="494" height="204"></p>
<p>Solusek Ro was a quick and dirty fight, and upon his death we all did rejoice 
as we made a mad dash to hail the flag guy. It was getting late but we did manage 
to roam around the zone for awhile and lemme tell you, its the best zone I've 
come to in all of Planes of Power. Lots of named mobs and bosses, heaps of good 
loot and 65 spell runes, and COTH works. No shit!</p>

loot, and more ss's of mis-channeled cyber:</p>

<p>6 days ago, Ashen Vendetta zoned into Plane of Tactics without ever seeing Rallos Zek before.  Our goal you ask?  Fairly simple.  Our goal was to make Rallos Zek dead so we can move forward into the Planes of Power and leave tiers 1-3 behind.  Going into the event we didn't know what to expect. We heard other guilds taking 2 - 3 weeks to learn the encounter.  So we knew we had our work cut out for us.</p>
<p align="center">The Target:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/1-12-03/ralloszek.jpg" width="597" height="752"><br>
<p>The first few days we quickly learned there was 3 stages to this fight.  Each stage you needed to kill certain mobs to get the next trigger to spawn.  We learned you needed to work excellent together as a team but you needed to do it without error and with speed in order to beat the timer on each stage. By day 3 Ashen was really working out all the final kinks in our strat for the final fight with Rallos Zek. Friday night we showed up and had everything working perfect.  We came up short on the final stage.</p>
<p>With the determination of breaking into the elemenatal planes and a little persuasion,</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/1-12-03/sanah1.jpg" width="454" height="44"><br>
<p>Ashen zoned into Plane of Tactics tonight determined to drop this guy.</p>
<p>We blazed through stage 1, and Knocked stage 2 right out.  Near flawless on both parts.  So the stage was set for our showdown with Rallos Zek the Warlord.</p>
<p align="center">The Battle:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/1-12-03/rallos112031.jpg"><img src="images/1-12-03/rallos112031_thm.jpg" width="400" height="320" border="0"></a></p>

<p>With our recent string of victories against foes of all sort, the path before 
us has turned towards the Tower of Solusek Ro. This is the best zone I've seen 
so far in Planes of Power. Best in overall atmosphere, the mobs all look cool 
and the loot ain 't too shabby. We've only just started on the place, and as usual 
we will be delving deeper as time goes on. Here is a small glimpse of the place:
<p align="center"><a href="images/12-15/solro_1.jpg"><img src="images/12-15/solro_1thm.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a>

<i>First named we've come too, Arlyxir.</i>

<i>Arlyxir defeated.</i>
<p>Now this is where things get better. On our first raid night here (albeit a 
small force late at night) we made it to a named that wasn't really too tough. 
Add to that the loot quality, and I'm warming up to this fiery zone! Loot, of 
course:
<p align="center"><img src="images/12-15/corrupted_flame.gif" width="456" height="206"><br>

<p align="left">Nice stuff, about on par with Vex Thall loot. I think from here 
on out we will be seeing some really nice rewards. I hope!
<p align="left">Besides our field trips to new zones, some lower tier mobs had 
to die. Sure can get dull going back the umpteenth time to re flag recruits, folks 
on vacation, and our twinks; but sometimes things can be very enjoyable;

too, need to get a SS of it.

<p>I was watching Spider Man on DVD not too long ago. Decent movie, and I'd say 
my favorite scene is when we see Jerry Mcguire (or whatever the heck his name 
is) battle it out in the steel cage match against none other than Randy "Machoman" 
Savage. Ooooh yeeeah, he is by far my favorite pro-wrestler of all time, right 
behind The Iron Sheikh and the guy that threw Frisbees.</p>

<p>How does this all apply to Everquest? Why it would be Mithaniel Marr, deity 
of paladins or Freeport or something. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/12-7/marr_1.jpg" width="400" height="298"><br>
<i>Insert Machoman cliche here.</i></p>
<p>He's really a cool looking mob, but bears a strong resemblance to one beef 
stick jockey (Randy Savage, not Chris Lowell). Our first two outings (one on 
purpose and one by accident) ended up with us going down for the count. Tonight 
was a different matter all together.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/12-7/marr_2.jpg" width="400" height="286"><br>
<i>Lights out.</i></p>
<p>In a battle resembling that cage match from Spiderman (minus the cage and Spiderman, 
and the manager with the bullhorn) we slugged it out with Mithaniel. His hit points 
went below zero and we were all happy. I jest, he was a tough fight and a rewarding 
victory. It felt good to totally trash the Halls of Honor A trials and Mithaniel 
Marr in such a short time. Anyway, here is some of his drops:</p>

<p>Yet I saw 60 Turkeys tonight. Let me back up some though...</P>
<p>I'm sure those that stop by, besides the regulars, those of you in the Innoruuk 
Community, have noticed a dry spell of news. We haven't dried up or vanished. 
In fact we have been hard at work figuring out the planar progression, with a 
patch here and there changing it; it's been a tad harrowing. That's fine. The 
game is allot more fun when there is a challenge and/or puzzle.</P>

<p>Lots of mobs died. Hell, we even went back to some old stomping grounds to 
see what they are like nowadays (ridiculously easy, I think even our Rangers could 
tank Emperor[except Gherak- neener neener!]). We have been beating around the 
bush. All because of one tough ass encounter:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/11-30/bertox1.jpg"><img src="images/11-30/bertox1_thm.jpg" border="0"></a><br>
<i>This mob and his entire army can kiss my ass!!!</i></p>

<p>We've done the encounter quite a bit. We've fought him a few times now. He 
is hard. The entire encounter is hard. If you don't win in a certain time, the 
encounter depops, ala the Avatar of War. That too, is cool. It means you have 
allot on the line and can't slack.</p>

<p>Here is where things get decidedly un- cool... </p>
<p>We gathered the troops and went at it tonight. We did the dynamic content (albeit 
really sloppy from the communal hangover the guild seemed to have). It wasn't 
pretty, but we fought legions of mobs and mini bosses (some that have ridiculously 
overpowered abilities) and got Bertoxx to spawn. We were ahead of depop by a only 
a few minutes, but hell we've done AoW like that after a wipe out.</p>

<p> Our pullers nab him, and we get down to business. This is where we have failed 
so many times before. This time was different. The line held, we were not going

the road. One thing I <i><b>do</b></i> know is that the next time you see a screen

<p>Irongut is slackin (probably expin' like I should be doing), so I'm going to update this thing.</p>
<p>So last night we headed out to the Plane of Torment to kill the resident dominatrix goddess, Saryrn.  She is quite the S&M fanatic, spiked beds, cages, barbed sticks... and a bird.  The whole 9 yards, so to speak.</p>

<p>Anyway, after a glorious battle she ended up dead, as was the plan. The boss encounters in Planes of Power continue to impress me.  They're so much nicer than the 20 minute /afk fights in Vex and Ssra.</p>

and Vallon, the name sakes of EQ's emptiest servers. These are not chumps though, 
and instead of calling you a gimp bluebie, they give your guild a beat down. After 
a few wipeouts the night before, we were determined to kill us some Demigods.</p>

<p>
First of all, no, this is not our new web site. I have changed the style sheet 
and formatting, but the new site will be going up on another server sometime in 
the near future. One thing that <b><i>IS</i></b> working is our new members section. 
Just click the link above to check it out.</p>
<p>Well, where to start. For one, I have to give credit to the devs at Sony Online 
for releasing, IMHO, the best EQ expansion. The rollout was without major incident, 
and not the massive bug- laden pos that was known as Shadows of Luclin. I have 
a few minor gripes though.</p>
<p>For one, the Devs need to address zone stability after boss-type mobs are defeated. 
We have had NightmareB and Plane of Disease crash multiple times after killing 
the bosses, effectively rolling back the loot and whatnot. Frustrating, but looks 
like it wouldn't be hard to solve.</p>
<p>Also, I know where you guys were going by disallowing COTH in some zones. Don't 
disable them completely in zones, just certain parts (ala Ssra temple) because 
not having coth in an EXP zone is absolutely stupid. I'm not fighting my group 
all the way back to the zone because a member our our exp group had to leave. 
</p>
<p>On to the good stuff. I'm having a blast raiding some of these places. There 
is allot of content too, coupled with high end zones from previous expansions 
there is elbow room to spare. I don't see a reason why guilds should feel the 
pinch and race each other (unless there is one friggen mob or zone with all the 
best loot we haven't seen yet, I friggen hope not).</p>
<p>The fights are quick and lethal, none of the 20 minute+ marathon endurance 
contests (at least not yet). This is good. A fight should be about strategy and 
tactics, and not on counting to 3 or pressing defensive.</p>
<p>We once again took out Terris Thule. The loot is fair, at least for us, but 
for lower tier guilds that will see her the loot will be great.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/11-3/terris_thule1.jpg" width="400" height="417"><br>
-Before-</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/11-3/terris_thule2.jpg" alt="Terris Thule, dead again" width="400" height="482"><br>
-After-</p>
<p>After more exp and exploring, we figured out how to enter this gem of a zone, 
Plane of Torment:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/11-3/torment_1.jpg"><img src="images/11-3/torment_thm1.jpg" alt="Plane of Torment" width="400" height="300" border="0"></a><br>

-Some of the locals-<br>
<br>
<img src="images/11-3/unimaginable_horror.jpg" width="400" height="334"><br>
-AV encounters a boss mob-</p>
<p>Torment is a nifty zone that we will be seeing much more of in the coming days. 
So is this all we have been up too? Of course not!</p>
<p>There are many other zones to raid. In the plane of disease we met up with 
Grummus, and preceded to kill him. Killed him a few times, because the zone crashed 
before we could hand loot out or figure out what the heck was up. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/11-3/grummus.jpg" alt="Fat!" width="400" height="286"><br>
-Looks ready for an exam of some sort-</p>
<p>Another zone we have been smashing through is the Crypt of Decay. Having fun 
exploring this zone:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/11-3/war_chief.jpg" alt="Rats!" width="400" height="323"><br>

-Av vs High Priest Ultor Szanvon-<br>
<br>
<img src="images/11-3/mob_quote.gif" width="319" height="41"></p>
<p>All in all, a very fun first 2 weeks of this expansion. Sure, the loot is rather 
weak, but I feel the loot is good for up and coming guilds that most of these 
encounters are designed for.</p>
<p>More to come, stay tuned!</p>

<p class="detailsBold">The fight with Terris is pretty intense, and different from any other fight we've ever encountered.  And I must say, that was the most fun I've had in a long long time.  If Terris Thule's encounter is any indication of what's to come, then PoP will be by far the best expansion for EQ.  The fight was a close one, (also it was 3:30 AM *yawn*) and things were looking grim.  But somehow we pulled through and made Terris Thule die for the first time on Innoruuk.</p>

      <p class="detailsBold">So yea... we killed Seru again the other night.  It was an amazing battle!  In fact, it was so exciting that Irongut felt the need to die while Inquisitor was at 3% so our clerics wouldn't fall asleep.  However, as trivial Seru might be, he atleast looks cool... and I guess that makes up for sitting around and doing nothing most of the fight.  Unfortunately, I don't have any screen shots of him... and even more unfortunate is that I can't blame it on Zmim.</p>

<p class="detailsBold">So why isn't FatGut doing the update?  Well, truth be told, he's not really fat anymore.  We sent him on a diet, and he's running laps at the YMCA at the moment, but when he gets back I'm sure he'll have something to say....

		<p class="detailsBold">Well its been almost a month since I last updated 
this sucker, blame it on the end of the summer, Labor Day, and the NFL gearing 
up. Actually, I was just lazy :)
<p class="detailsBold">So what's with the circa 1970's hippie title? No, I'm not 
quoting Crosby Stills and Nash; this is as good a summary of what the last few 
weeks have been for the crew. One minute you are kicking much virtual mob ass, 
the next you are turing into Corky and Webster fighting over the last of the kool 
aid. I have seen great fights, and I have seen, for lack of a better term, shit.
<p class="detailsBold">But hey, that's why we play the game, when you know one 
ill turn can cause corpse summoning. 
<p class="detailsBold">For the most part we have been fighting in Vex Thall, Ssra, 
and a few odd bosses of this zone or that. A Shei Vinitras here, Burrower there, 
etc. Highlights include trying AoW with 34 people, most of those 2 boxing at 2 
am on a weeknight. Got him to 7%. That was the most fun I've had loosing in a 
long time :)
<p class="detailsBold">So the Valleys? Wasting a perfectly good Emperor here and 
there. <a href="images/9-9/train_1.jpg" target="_blank">Training ourselves in 
VT</a>. 
<p class="detailsBold">The Peaks? Wasting a perfectly good AoW. <a href="images/9-9/train_2.jpg">Training 
ourselves in VT</a> (and living). 
<p class="detailsBold">After our slump of performing like a pick up Plane of Fear 
raid, we got back to biz. This latest patch saw us gaining mo powah from our squad 
of l33t melee clerics. Seriously, get rid of that stupid hammer and make the proc 
a buff (ala ranger self buff) so our clerics can use much better ratio weapons 
with much better stats. 
<p class="detailsBold">Duh VI. Instead of giving clerics Melee power (i do agree 
that bash was good), you should have instead raised cleric def cap, and gave clerics 
a more flexible set of new spells instead of the (mostly) shitty new heals and 
summoned hammer. You are going to give druids and shamans new heals (and I agree 
both classes could use a bump in healing. Just a bump), toss clerics some love 
too. AE raid heals? Maybe a lure root. I dunno, ask the clerics I guess.
<p class="detailsBold">Ok, enough ranting fat boy.
<p class="detailsBold">Also with this patch, VT was upgraded. Excellent,... er 
um well more like ok.
<p class="detailsBold">So what's new? Well for starters the yard trash seems to 
have less hit points (<font color="#FFFFFF">although this could just be every 
cleric swinging his new toy and no afk casters trying to super nuke for that phat 
red con exp</font>). Certain spots are no longer safe, and well, I'm sort of on 
the fence about this but its true now that you got to earn those named every trip. 
<p class="detailsBold">Oh yea, no more f'n AE blind. Guess the bazillion &quot;<font color="#FFFFFF"><em>/feedback 
Hey, AE blind sucks monkey nutz</em></font>&quot; from every VT enabled guild 
payed off. Seriously, there were times when we would get 3-5 blinders at once 
(all non mezzable kind) and you would be staring at your blank monitor for 5 minutes 
straight until they finally came and lay the smack down. No amount of skill could 
save you, if you didn't pull that many you'd get caught in the respawn. Fun, eh? 
;)
<p class="detailsBold">Well, I'm glad to say that VT is now much better overall. 
Loot that was utter crap is now quite good. Still a tough place, but Aten Ha Ra 
remains tops on reward for any mob in Luclin. From just this last clearing, look 
at what we got (<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know i missed a few</font>) :

		<p class="detailsBold">Although I personally enjoyed the patch and server 
reset spawns, there comes a point when it starts to get old. Enter Vex Thall, 
we had to avoid this place during Innoruuk's spasms. Logging people at a point 
just when the zone is getting good (the mobs that don't suck) only to have the 
server reset can be frustrating beyond anything in EQ. Goes with the territory 
I suppose.
<p align="center" class="detailsBold"><img src="images/innoruuk.jpg" width="360" height="254"><br>
<em>&quot;We are out of coffee, oh btw Innoruuk is down again.&quot;</em>
<p class="detailsBold">The gods of stability granted the players of Innoruuk some 
time this week to get things done. 
<p class="detailsBold">Before I get into the usual slew of ss loot/dead mobs, 
I'd like to take the time to say what an outstanding job the boys and girls of 
AV have done against the Emperor the last two times. Back to back 54 person kills, 
at times pulling victory from certain defeat. It doesn't get any more intense 
than that kind of a fight. Great job :)
<p class="detailsBold">Now onto the important matters, i.e. the good stuff. 
<p class="detailsBold">Vex Thall. You've read about it many places, including 
here. About what needs changed, upgraded, etc. Even though the zone only got a 
weeks preparation from VI, the zone its extremely demanding. Rumor is that the 
zone is getting looked at, that loot will get upgraded. With just the right tweaks 
in a few areas the zone will be quite entertaining until Planes of Power is released.

<em>Ever wondered who Pain and Suffering was?</em>
<p class="detailsBold">In just two days AV tore through the zone and clearing 
it before some chromosome-challenged intern at Sony HQ could trip the circuit 
breaker. For the most part, each boss went down without much difficulty. Except 
for Aten, who gave us some fits there for a bit. After some adjustments, pulled 
the big lass and all was well. The only people to die were those that 10k'd from 
the fuxored flux. 
<p class="detailsBold">It felt good to add Aten Ha Ra to the Emp and Aow for mobs 
we have killed not loosing the MT. You don't need hordes of people or 10+ Wizards 
when your clerics fucking own.
<p class="detailsBold">Speaking of Clerics that own, the man the Rensak loves 
to heckle will get a reprieve this update.
<p align="center" class="detailsBold"><img src="images/wolves.jpg" width="358" height="531"><br>
Or not.
<p class="detailsBold">The Aten Ha Ra kill capped off a fast and furious clearing 
of VT, and she rewarded us with some kick ass loot.

	<p>Nothing new on this front, kill this, kill that, die to bugs here, die to bugs there. 
	Innoruuk is up, nope Innoruuk is down, no Innoruuk is up, o look Innoruuk us down.
	For the love of god, take it down for a day and fix the shit.</p>
	
	<p>Here's my favorite of the week to due with the server "stability".  After finishing 
	off some containers in Akheva, the server crashes.  After 30 minutes I go to bed because 
	its late, no telling when the server will be back up.  When I log in the next day I immediately
	LD thanks to the awesome patch that someone forgot to include the .bmp file... great job on that one.
	So when I finally get back on i'm buck naked at my bind. I think to myself, hell no i'm not going to 
	run back to Akheva and drag my own corpse and make a cleric come out and res me. I'm going to make a 
	fucking GM take 2 minutes out of his time before the server crashes again, go to Akheva, summon my 
	corpse, and res my ass with a GM res. So the conversation starts off something like this.</p>

	<p>/petition Due to the server crashing last night,  I died when I logged in today. I would appreciate
	 a summon and res when you have time.</p>
	<p>(1 hour later)</p>

	<p>you tell Dork, 'ok, ill start over then.  Last night the server crashed around 1:15am cst, my group 
	was in akheva near IV getting containers for VT keys, server was down awhile so I just went to bed.
	I logged in this afternoon and thanks to the fine quality patch that was pushed that forgot a file, I
	immediately crashed to desktop, once I got the patch problem resolved I logged back in to find myself dead 
	at my bind point. I'd like a summon and res from Akheva when your free.'</p>
	<p>Dork tells you, 'one moment'</p>
	<p>(15 minutes)</p>
	<p>Dork tells you, 'I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do, no one knows anything about the server crashing last night'
	<p>You tell Dork, 'don't start with me.  Look at your log files, Innoruuk server is like a cold 2 day 
	old turd at the moment, it's been crashing everyday for a freaking week, and it crashed last night at 1:15cst'
	<p>Dork tells you, 'Sorry, I talked to everyone around me here and they all said they don't think it crashed 
	last night, have a good day!'
	<p>(10 mins of me deciding if I am going to make this dipshit cry or if I should get it escalated... I chose the latter)</p>
	<p>You tell Dork, 'So I assume you are considering this matter closed?'</p>
	<p>Dork tells you, 'I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do, the server did not crash last night'</p>
	<p>You tell Dork, 'I'll expect an apology from you soon, escalate this petition to a lead gm now.'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'Hail, and well met. What can I do for you today?'</p>
	<p>You tell LeadDork, 'Long story short. Check your logs, the server crashed last night at 1:15am cst, I died 
	because of the server crashing in Akheva. I'd like a summon and a res because of the server crashing.  Your GM,
	not a guide, is trying to tell me that the server did not crash last night. If the server
	did not crash, that would be odd, because red LOCKED next to the server name tells me that the server isn't online'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'One moment'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'Ok, I verified the server was down last night, let me port to Akheva and get you ressed'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'I'm sorry, you don't have any corpses in Akheva'</p>
	<p>You tell LeadDork, 'don't try it... look again.'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'oops, I was misspelling your name hehe'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'ok, i'll have to summon you here, then I will have to manually reset your experience bar'</p>
	<p>(customer service res)</p>
	<p>(loot corpse)</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'dont loot all of your corpse yet, i'm trying to find out how to reset your experience'</p>
	<p>You tell LeadDork, 'you already did, it happens with the CS res.'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'o, really?  I didn't know that'</p>
	<p>You tell LeadDork, 'Do me a favor, and tell GMDork that the server crashed last night, so no one else gets the same BS
	 I went through when he tries to tell them the server didn't crash last night'
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'It's already been one. I informed him as soon as I checked the logs and verified that the server crashed'</p>

	
	<p>So that took 2 hours of my time. I should have just ran my ass back there and did it myself and saved the hassle.  But 
	there is something called principle.  Don't tell me the server didn't crash you moron unless you talk to someone who was 
	actually there, and not try to piss people off and take the easy way out and hope they will just go away.  The CS for
	EQ is utterly horrible, a fucking trained monkey could do a better job than what is going on in EQ right now.  Whoever is 
	running your CS is a moron.  "New and Improved Floating GM's" what a novel idea	it's just a shame that's an excuse to 
	funnel semi half assed support away from where it's needed to god knows where, Stormhammer? Tech Support? Maybe you needed
	them to drive that fucking van you're driving around the country trying to give away free accounts.  Whatever you're doing 
	with the CS, or lack of it, you are doing a shitty job.</p>

	<p>Ok, enough of my ranting. EQ is going to hell in a handbasket if the live team doesn't get off their ass and make some
	 tough decisions.  All you casters should probably go read this thread <A HREF="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=b68b4a4ecbbcd46ef2ee386487686b18&threadid=2252">Manapool</A>

<p>One of the nice things about VT, is we finally have new places to push things 
to...<br>
<img src="/buffe/stuck.jpg"></p>
<p>And everyone learns a little bit more about their class. <img src="/buffe/rage.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course there is always some miscommunication <img src="/buffe/bards1.jpg"> 
</p>
<p>But once that miscommunication is understood, all is set straight <img src="/buffe/bards2.jpg"></p>
<p> One of the big things i've learned, is don't fuck with The Druid Union... 
TDU has ways of getting back at you. Need a port dear guildleader ? </p>

<br> <br> <p>I've also learned the The Mage Union is ruthless... <img src="/buffe/tmu.jpg"></p>
<p>And TWU is like that guy at you're office who has it so good, yet complains 
about everything nonstop...<img src="/buffe/twu1.jpg"> 
<p>Something is going on in The Cleric Union, but I can't quite figure it out

<p>Of course there is The Shamen Union, but those guys are a bit wierd, and uhh 
scary <img src="/buffe/steel.jpg"></p>
<br> <p>Enough of that, we've been busy busy in Vex Thal, trying to convince everyone 
that AE blind is their friend, and TDU is their enemy. We peeked our heads out 
of VT recently a bit to knock off another High Priest, AoW, Emperor Ssraeshza. 
Emperor is on our farm club, we're hoping one day he'll be in the major leagues 
again.</p>
<br> <p>Sometimes my bank get's full, so I need to make room <img src="/buffe/callerdes.jpg">

<br> <p>We're thinking about just giving all our extra power sources to the newest 
up and coming guild on Innoruuk,<A href=http://meadbh.net/LoDaB>LoDaB</a>. I hear 
they are finally close to killing one of the easiest mobs in the high end game 
now <A href=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7830>Vyzh'dra the

<p>But no, sadly we won't team up with you to kill Emperor Ssraeshza, <img src="/buffe/oricalum-emp.jpg">

<p>The High Priest dropped two Halos, one for our gnome hero Zumkin and for Cleone.
