<p>So as I'm sure you all know, I'm a slacker and only update the front page when the rest of the guild bugs me to do so.. and so here's the update:</p>
<p>The other day Noqufiel got knocked the fuck out by Ashen Vendetta, granting us access to Txevu (Zeh-voo), the Lair of the Elites... impressive name I know, but we'll see just how elite stuff is in there real soon.  I'm sure the designers were thinking, "Hey I know, let's make up some weird and nearly unpronounceable names for these zones and give them cool subtitles!".   Anyway, that's an old rant, enough of that...</p>
<a href="7-1/noqufiel.jpg" border="0"><img src="7-1/NoqufielSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>Inktu`ta is my new favorite zone.  Talk about some crazy events in there - but hey, I wont argue with free loot!  Noqufiel was especially fun, up until someone slacked and I got death touched at 0%... so Ferreus was kind enough to provide the above screen shot for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>I promise I'll have a more interesting picture up here next week... Like Uvavu's corpse... that hasn't made the front page in a long time! ;(</p>

<p>So, now that Kessdona and Rikkukin are farm status, we decided to go try something new.  The Queen in Riftseeker's Sanctum seemed like a good target.</p>
<p>We gathered our forces and marched into the crystaline tower and unleashed hell.  First attempt at the Queen got her to 2% health.  It was close, but we know she was toast next time.  Second try we got her - potatowned as Master Samwise would say.</p>
<a href="6-7/QueenDead.jpg" border="0"><img src="6-7/QueenSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>I have to say, our healing team has come a long way since we started reflagging for Time.  They were really on form last night, and it showed.</p>
<p>Expect to see the King's corpse on this webpage shortly, as well.</p>

<p>Well, it's been a while since we've updated the webpage, but that doesn't mean we've been sitting around doing nothing. We've been quite busy.  So far The Nameless has been an interesting server, but we've been kicking ass here just the same as we did on Innoruuk.</p>
<p>So anyway, I like pictures (don't you?), so here's quick recap of what's been going on with us:</p>
<a href="6-1/Kelekdrix.jpg" border="0"><img src="6-1/KelekdrixSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>This guy (gal) had been giving us some trouble, but now she's dead.  We also got the Stonemite Ring while we were there.  Weirdness.</p>
<p>Oh, we've also been killing my favorite creatures: Dragons.  Kessdona and Rikkukin both have gone splat by Ashen Vendetta</p>
<a href="6-1/Rikkukin.jpg" border="0"><img src="6-1/RikkukinSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<br>
<a href="6-1/Kessdona.jpg" border="0"><img src="6-1/KessdonaSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<br>
<p>Not very glorious pictures I know, but Less, our new guild photographer (and scape goat) got a good one of Rikkukin.</p>
<a href="6-1/RikkukinBig.jpg" border="0"><img src="6-1/RikkukinBigThumb.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>Kessdona looks about the same as Rikkukin, just imagine that the dragon is gold instead of platinum.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks Ashen has been focusing on Uqua while clearing time and doing epics and other various fights.  Let me be the first to say that it hasn't been easy in Uqua for us.  I think we trained ourselves in every way imaginable in that zone.  We stuck with it though and tonight it paid off. </p>
<p>We blew through the first half of Uqua tonight looking better than we ever have in that zone.  We got to the second gas chamber and like every other trip, it went from great to shit really fast.  Someone clicked early and yeah we pretty much all died at the second chamber.</p>
<p>We didn't give up though.  We rezed up, moved forward and finally got to see Barxt for our first time.  We were not expecting to win, hell I was just happy we didn't end the night in a train.  We charged into the room, tossed some dwarves at Barxt and knocked him the fuck out on our first attempt. </p>
<p>Qvic is certainly not the end game of EQ right now but I'm very proud of our guild hanging in there breaking into Qvic.  Our goal was to be in Qvic before our merge to the Nameless and we have accomplished it.  Now on to bigger and better things! </p>

<p>There we were, a group of Ashen in the middle of Lavastorm helping a few gnomes dig their way through a cave.  Not knowing what was on the other side was part of the excitement.  We worked quickly to gather the parts that the miners needed to blast forward.  With one last blast the rock fell and out came a dragon to terrorize Lavastorm.</p>
<br>
<p>We gathered our forces and moved deep into Lavastorm to get a better look at Tirranun.  The call was made by our fearless leader Steelhammer to charge, so we ran forward into battle with the intent of slaying the fiery dragon.  The fight was fierce and before we knew it, the mighty dragon Tirranun turned its tail and ran away.</p>
<br>
<p>We didn't forget that day on the hill just above the pool of lava that emptied throughout the mountains.  We explored the lands past the caves until we caught the tracks that could only be from such a beast that we fought in the mountains.  We tracked him back to his lair where he stood there waiting for us to battle to the death once again.  </p>

<br>
<p>Ashen charged up the bridge to his lair where Steelhammer gave the same call to charge.  Swords were swinging, Spells were casting, and this time Tirranun had no where to run..</p>

<center><p>Man, I love dragons... Don't you?  Esepcially huge ones, with nasty big pointy teeth.  Like this one:</p>
<a href="images/2-23-05/Quarm1Big.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/2-23-05/Quarm1Small.jpg" border="0"></a>

<p>It's funny, I knew he was big; but I never realized just how big he was.  Obviously, it was going to take a ton of gnomes to satisfy him (he didn't take too kindly to our seafood run for him last month - /rude picky eaters)</p>
<br>
<img src="images/2-23-05/Quarm2Small.jpg" border="0">

<br>

<p>Still, we united the gnomes and made our offer, but he wasn't having it.  No, he wanted elf.  Foolish dragon, didn't anyone tell him elves are invincible?  So anyway, armed with the strength of Moskau, Quarm met his demise at the hands of Ashen Vendetta once again.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>So, as promised, Quarm's corpse:</p>
<a href="images/2-23-05/QuarmDead.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/2-23-05/QuarmDeadSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<br>
<p>I can't comment about the rest of his heads, as a few knights that will remain nameless decided they would make good mantle pieces over their fireplaces and carried them off... </p>

<p>Major props to everyone in AV tonight - they owned it up.  All of Phase 5 and Quarm owned on the first try.  Plane of Time = wtfpwndirl.</p>

<center><p>Well, it's expansion time again - this time with my favorite kind of monster: Dragons.  Ashen Vendetta has always had a thing for dragons so naturally, we were pretty eager to check this new ones out.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, in order to get to the Broodlands before the next day of the expansion there's a quest you need to do to get rid of the rocks.  Well, instead of exploiting our way through, we did the quest, and as a result set off a script that opened up the Broodlands and spawned one bad-ass looking dragon:</p>

<br></br>
<a href="images/2-17-05/Tirranun-1.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/2-17-05/Tirranun1.jpg" border="0"></a>
<br>
<p>This guy is by far the coolest looking dragon I've seen to date, so just like Ashen Vendetta would be the ones to wake the dragon (again), we decided since we spawned him, we might as well kick his ass too.</p>

<p>So, we went after our new lava-covered friend and fed him dwarves, paladins and wizards.  This was the key to victory, as the effects of Moksau are not as potent as they once were and we were nearly out of gnomes.</p>
<br>
<a href="images/2-17-05/TirranunFightBig.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/2-17-05/TirranunFightSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<br>
<p>So to make a long story short, we knocked this big bruiser down to 75% and he took off running with his tail between his legs.  But we're not done with him yet - You can bet that you'll see his corpse on this page soon, then we'll see who is crunchy and good with ketchup!</p>
