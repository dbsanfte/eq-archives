<td class="table1"><hr color="#8C8C8C" noshade><font color="#8C8C8C">
<p>In May of 2000, a few friends got together after a guild named Storm fell apart.  The original intent was to form a guild where we could just hang out, bull shit and have fun.  Ashen Vendetta was formed and what happened the next few years we never imagined.
</p>
<p>For the first two months Ashen only had a roster of around 10 people.  We were booking plane of fear and plane of hate raids and borrowing an enchanter, monk, & a cleric or two from Dawn of the Phoenix to help us out.  Some where along the line, we picked up the desire to be a top raiding guild so we decided to start piecing together a guild that could do the bigger mobs.</p>
<p>After building a core group of members we decided to put a goal date on our first "big kill".  Trakanon was still new to guilds at the time and we had decided that we were going to kill him by October 21st, 2000.  We killed Trakanon for the first time exactly on October 21st, 2000.  We weren't the first on the server to do so but it was impressive seeing how we had only been around for 5 months as a guild.</p>
<p>The guild moved forward and entered Veeshan's Peak second to Legions of Darkness.  We zoned in wanting to prove something to not only the server but to ourselves.  A month after we first entered we cleared Veeshan's Peak for Innoruuks first clearing of the zone.  No one expected us to do it.  We were determined to prove all the nay sayers wrong.</p>
<p>From the high of Veeshan we decided to storm into Velious.  We were slowly gaining ground on the competition of Legions of Darkness and The Pantheon.  The Pantheon had owned up on working their way to Sleepers while we and LoD were running into each other and forming the biggest rivalry this server will ever see.  Racing each other, training each other, and doing everything possible to one up each other, we seemed to be in each others face every day and lasted many expansions.  Ashen would have never made it to the top if it wasn't for LoD always being there to make us push harder.  For as much as I hate to admit, LoD was one of the biggest reasons that kept this guild wanting to be on top.  Who else better to knock off the top other than the guild that used to pass us off as they ran into solb and permafrost in their planar gear and just completely owned up Nagafen and Vox.</p>
<p>Towards the middle to end of Velious Ashen really started to be on even ground with LoD if not just in front of them.  On a night that I will never forget, Ashen woke the sleeper on Innoruuk.  We went down knowing that it was only a matter of time before LoD tried to wake him so we basically did it ourselves.  Rounding out Velious mobs we finished clearing the expansion with what is still one of my favorite fights.  The Avatar of War.  We worked our assess off learning how to kill him and it paid off in the end.  Yes folks, we were the first guild to bring Avatar of War loot to the Bazaar :)</p>
<p>Luclin was pure ownage for us.  We were raiding just about 7 nights a week trying to clear every named possible in Luclin.  Originally we were going to go the Acrylia route and we had the first key to inner acrylia across all servers.  Catarina worked her ass off trying to do that quest and running into bugged and broken content.  Once she got the key made she got rewarded for being the first player to complete it by having an item named after her that now drops off the boss of acrylia.  From seeing how bad that zone was though we quickly jumped into Ssra and started hammering away at keys.  Vex Thal was our goal and we were going to be first in there.  We were the 5th guild across all servers to kill Emperor Ssra and around 7th overall to clear Vex Thall.  We were on top and had space between us and LoD for the first time.</p>
<p>Planes of Power came out and we headed into it and never looked back.  We quickly cleared through most of the lower tiers and entered the elementals 3 months after it was released.  Broken content and back flagging took the wind out of our sails though.  Re-flagging people over and over because you needed 60-70 people to raid burnt a lot of our core members out.  Watch 6 months of a lead that you had over other guilds dwindle away because you were blocked on the Rather Council killed any momentum we had.  We stuck it out though and came through by killing Quarm and clearing another expansion first.</p>
<p>Gates of Discord had so many issues that the majority of Ashen called it quits.  It wasn't balanced for level 65's and running into brick walls over and over killed the game for us. From 6 man trials that were not balanced correctly to being stuck in broken zones like Uqua for two months hoping for fixes to come, our excitment to be out front and our fun in EQ pretty much ended.  We lost many members to the design of the game, some to other games and even more to real life.  It really wasn't one persons fault or even a number of people.  The truth of the matter is a bunch of circumstances most out of our control caught up to us and hit us hard.  The last few months we have been stumbling around dazed and confused much like Mike Tyson was after James Buster Douglas unleashed some massive shots onto him.</p>
<p>So after lots of discussion about where the guild is today we have decided to step back and enjoy ourselves.  We will no longer raid to be a front runner on new content.  We will no longer bang our heads off the walls trying to re-flag players and mass recruit just to stay alive.  Instead our plan is to sit back and relax some.  Have some fun with each other and if we decide to raid something it will be on our time and we will want to do it.  We're mostly tired of EQ feeling like a second and third job for us.  We want to go back to the days where the only things that mattered were the people you called friends in guild chat.  We will be helping each other out on quests, levels, AA's or just being there for each other.  Perhaps one day we will get the urge to throw ourselves back into the hardcore raiding guild scene.  Until that day comes or doesn't you will find members of this guild having fun and just enjoying life.</p>
<p>The most important thing that I have seen through the last 4+ years in Ashen is this.  Items and loot are just numbers and they're easily replaced.  Friendships are the most important thing in life and that is no different in the world of EverQuest.  Some might be surprised by this but the drive behind most of the officers that built this guild wasn't loot or items or magelo profiles.  We killed stuff to kill it together and have a hell of a time in the process.  Loot was never a driving force for us.  It was always just a bonus for doing what we loved to do.</p>
<p>I apologize for this long update.  Ashen has been a big part of my life from the time I formed it until this very day.  I have so many great memories in this guild that I will never forget and so many to look forward to.  I want to personally thank every single member that was ever a part of Ashen Vendetta for helping make the best guild one could be a part of.</p>

<p>The ebb and flow of Everquest’s life cycle has been more evident in recent times than ever before – going through the growing, or perhaps more accurately, shrinking pains has been akin to watching the England v Portugal football match (yes, it’s called football for you unschooled doubters out there).  There are high points, there are low points; then there are even greater peaks, and yet lower troughs.  A rollercoaster ride that sometimes leaves you unsure of what to feel, or at a loss as to what to do or say.
</p>
<p>As a guild who doesn’t resort to pick-up lines such as “Hey baby, there’s a raid happening at my pad, wanna join in?” (well okay, Snoog tried but he has permanent slap marks to show for that now – Kelle seems to do the trick though!), building up numbers has been a difficult and long process, but perhaps we are beginning to see a switch in fortunes.  Is that a speck of light at the end of the tunnel, or just last night’s stand shutting the door and leaving quietly after picking your pocket while we’ve been snoring happily away?
</p>
<p>Reflagging for PoTime has been taking place with the help of our friends over at Legions of Darkness, while on our own we have been doing a variety of older/interesting content:
</p>
<ul type=disc>
 <li>Ditching Packmaster with 30 people including recruits/bots;
 <li>Ditching Rondo with under 40 people including recruits/bots;
 <li>Ditching our clothes with 35 people including recruits/bots… err wait a sec.
 <li>Administering a beating across various PoP zones with… you’ve guessed it, around 30-40 people tops (including the cleanest Blazzaxx kill you’ll ever see, funny how people didn’t die unlike when you have 60 throwing themselves at a mob!)
 <li>Getting naked and filming ourselves in compromising positions, then reacting with shock and disbelief when those videos somehow get leaked out onto the Internet and are subject to mass downloads around the world, followed by a guild appearance on Saturday Night Live in an attempt to diffuse potential negative or disapproving conceptions about the guild as a whole.
</ul>
<p>I would post some pics and vids, but I’m not sure those “screenshots” would be suitable at this point in time.  Like the England game, it’s still a sensitive issue, so let’s not go there.  (Fuck it, just go to Google and search for Danaere “Cyberwhore” Passionheart, Steelhammer “Roberta” Soulforger, “Real Doll” Malinda the Sleepless, Snoogans “Asspoker” D’Mela, Lorilei “Flute” Speedyfeetz and of course Uvavu “Diggler” Eranu… ahem).
</p>
<p>To sum it up - from the highs of Uqua mini-bosses to the lows of Sol Ro, the veterans among us have experienced the veritable gamut of emotions – but while we have strength left to pick up the pieces, we will continue to do so.  Like England, we still have a strong core of dedicated officers flanked by a strong group of players, short in numbers as we are.  England have the 2006 World Cup to look forward to, but hopefully our own rejuvenation will finally come to pass a lot sooner than that.
</p>

<p><font size=2><b>If you’re interested in joining the fun and frolics, talk to Elycion, Luvmy, Kelletia or me in game or PM us on our forums.</b>  Server xfers are encouraged too!  We will be doing a mixture of Gates and PoP stuff, with considerably more emphasis on the former.  Kodtaz flags and Time access would be highly beneficial.</font>

<p>To LDoN or not to LDoN, that has been the question plaguing us since the expansion was released.  Farming elementals on nights outside of our Time rotation had reached the stage where even twinks were shunning some of the loot that came our way, allowing our good friend Rot to have many a field day.
</p>
<p>Given that some previously relatively empty zones were beginning to fill up with newly flagged people from a variety of guilds, we fought the alluring shackles of complacency and made the decision to push ahead with LDoN.  And although the patently annoying raiding restrictions imposed were enough to drive us bonkers, we attempted to make ground in the various missions offered while catering to every member's raiding needs.  This is frustrating enough for a guild of our size, with an average of 60 regulars online at any given night, so hats off to all the top end guilds who have struggled with LDoN but come through all the same.
</p>
<p>A couple of months back, we warmed up with Normal level raids to get to grips with the kind of adventure that would await us in the future.  We came through the Mistmoore, Takish and Rujarkian trials with relative ease on our first or second attempt and realised Time level raids were the ones that required the majority of our focus.
</p>
<p>It was a good wake up call really, because the brutal death limit and unpleasant dungeon inhabitants slapped us out of our Time-farming stupor and forced us to take on a steep learning curve.  With 36 people in the raid, there is small margin for error, and everyone's contribution is more or less vital to the final outcome of the adventure.  Success and failure were chasms on opposing sides of the knife edge we stepped on.  So although we racked up our losses and bore multiple scars on our backside from trips to Mistmoore and Rujarkian, progress was made with every attempt.
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-09-04/Valdoon.jpg"></img></p>

<p>Well this overgrown, pasty excuse for an undead corporal had it coming to him.  Last night, as a more youthful Bill Murray once remarked: We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-09-04/Valddead.jpg"></img></p>

<p>But wait, where is this mythical new loot that we were promised by our Wayfarer friends for dispatching this monstrous fiend?  Myth no longer dear reader!

		    <img src="./images/2-09-04/Valdbracer.jpg"></img>
</p>

<p>LDoN might not be everyone's cup of tea, but the intensity and focus required to achieve victory has undoubtedly helped us to tighten up a few areas on the raiding front - and regardless of what GoD brings, that will stand us in good stead.

<p>To celebrate the imminent release of Gates of Discord, we all felt that something a little bit special needed to be concocted, an incident worthy enough of mention in this long-overdue update.  The general consensus was that everyone would begin by making their contributions, however small, towards a fundamental change in raiding habits.  So for our latest Time run, Smushu finally put on some pants, Tameral decided that he wouldn't LD (ok I lied), Mal decided to loot some vaguely decent items for once (okay lying through my teeth now) and both X and Bal refrained from defiling each other while pulling (you must be wondering if any of this is actually true).  I myself even evaded the clutches of the Sleep Monster (omg, self buuurrrnnn!)
</p>
<p>That didn't quite seem to be enough for us though.  The ransacking of Time proceeded in the usual fashion, including some interesting stage 1 antics, the occasional exotic pull (hi entire stage 3 field), as well as the offering of random sacrificial victims during an otherwise flawless run.  I suppose the first incident that truly deserves mention was that we didn't aggro Vallon Zek while engaging his equally unappealing brother Tallon Zek, much to the surprise of all involved, which sparked some decidedly festive activity as everyone congratulated each other, patted themselves on the backs, and handed cookies all round.  Despite this veritable smorgasbord of fun and frivolity, we couldn't quite shake off the feeling that a certain something - that <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, as our esteemed French brothers would say - was missing.  Like a creeping shadow that silently haunts and extends with the waning of day's light, our discomfort grew with every passing god that lay slain at our feet.
</p>
<p>Thus did our dilemma continue right until our meeting with Quarm.  We racked our brains while our monks nuked, our wizards healed, our mages executed flawless flying kicks and our clerics tanked - but all to no avail.  In an act of desperation, we called in our berzerkers to contribute by chucking whatever random shit they could find.  As a last resort, we even camped a beastlord, hitherto totally unheard of in the entire documented history of Everquest.  During all this time, Quarm lost head after head in a flurry of frantic frenzy and then finally, right at the very death when there appeared to be absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel...

<p>When in doubt, blame the bards.  In this case though, after some sleuthing by various informants, there was simply no doubt:</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/buildup.gif"></img></p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/Ruvcredit.jpg"></img></p>

<p>The audible sigh of relief could be heard reverberating throughout the raid.  Who cares that Quarm was back at 33%, the important thing was - we could finally get a decent screenshot of his dead body!  Besides, we take everything in our stride, and are naturally unfazed by whatever comes to pass. 
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/response.gif"></img>
</p>

<p>Of course, in the heat of the moment, I forgot to take said screenshot.  All the singing, dancing and naked oil wrestling that followed had me somewhat distracted.
</p>
<p>Regardless of that minor point, what we DID end up discovering was that an uncontrollable rift in the very fabric of the space-time continuum, resulting from such a bizarre occurrence, caused parallel universes to coincide, leaving us with the following scenario:  two bubbles from alternate dimensions.  One contained Real Zeb, and the other, for lack of any other appropriate description, contained Stoner Zeb.
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/2pods.jpg"></img></p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/2zebs.jpg"></img></p>
<p>Real Zeb did all the 'right stuff', throwing casual lines at Druzzil while not strictly keeping his gaze at eye level, but the majority of the raid was fascinated by Stoner Zeb, who simply stood there and did... nothing.  It was truly an awe-inspiring sight to behold.  Valiant adventurers gladly risked the notorious teleporting death trap referred to simply as Come20KInPoKWithMe, just to gaze longingly at this true demigod.
</p>
<p>A fine way to end a memorable journey in Time indeed.</p>

<p>In other news:  <b>LDoN sucks</b>.  Oh wait, that's not news.  In any case, the next update will hopefully show you some pretty new pictures of dead things!
</p>
<p>Mixed in with this, due in part to slackness and also because January is perennially an ass-kicking month, is a belated Happy New Year message.  Yeah I know it's over a month late, and people have already broken all their resolutions by now, but there you go.
</p>
<p>Here's to hoping that GoD will bring us some interesting content that we can enjoy for the months to come!  Until then, be sure that we will find new and innovative ways to kill our rangers, as well as continuing to invest heavily in research towards changing the innate sexual orientation predominant in Lhile, bards and shadowknights.

<p>I know this update is going to look the same as the last update.  A big picture of Quarm dead and one of us telling you how we kicked his ass.</p>
<p>Not only did we go back into Plane of Time and cleared it, We fucking owned up on Quarm.  Our first Quarm kill last Plane of Time rotation was an intense battle.  Tonight we fucking 1 tanked the bitch.  Thats right Tukuk stepped up to the plate and our clerics delivered. I don't know what else to add to that other than telling my guildmates congrats on such ownage.</p>

<p>Ashen is now accepting applications for Warriors.  Details can be found on our fourms under the membership forums.  Cross server applications will be considered.

<p>Before I leave you I want to give the Rallos Zek server a big grats from AV on killing Kerafyrm.  Such an incredible kill to pull off.

<p>Since the relase of the Planes of Power, AV has been at the fore front smashing Gods left and right. We blazed through
Terris Thule, Saryn, Bertox, Mithaniel Marr, Rallos Zek, Solusek Ro, Fennin Ro, Xegony, Coirnav, and the Rathe Council many months
before anyone else on the server. We have been in the Plane of Time since June, but ran into massive problems over the summer.
We lost a huge amount of our veterans and many new members to retirement and general burnout with the game. Our attendence fell from
an average of 65-70 down into the low 40's. For most of June, July and August, we were clearing stages 1-3 with no more than 45-50 people
including boxed bots.</p>
<p>Things looked dire indeed at that point. The way Time is designed (anyone who has done it knows this) you need damn near 70 to
get the job done right, until upgrades and experience kick in. So AV had to rebuild half of our
entire guild if we ever wanted to clear the zone. We spent the latter summer months trying to take fresh faces through the paces. It was like redoing the entire expansion
in fast forward, except we hit pause too many times. I'll be the first to tell you, it sucks to take over a guild and have to do so
much rebuilding. But rebuilding is what we did.</p>
<p>We added many new people, from a huge variety of guilds, some from other servers. I can safely say that many of our brightest
players joined us during this timeframe, adding greatly to our cause of getting back on top of things. It took time, but eventually we got back
into Plane of Time and started to work the harder stages. It was tough. Many new people were not used to the cut throat speed you
need to move at to succeed in the end zone of PoP.
<p>Then it clicked. People started to kick some serious amounts of ass. We learned how to defeat the dreaded Zeks and can do them in near flawless fashion now. We smashed Bertox and Innoruuk and arrived at Quarm in mid October. I admit, it took nearly a month to figure Quarm out; but we stuck it out and got the job done... like so many times before. I've been here to see Phara Dar die, I remember tanking Ventanni and seeing the Sleeper unleashed upon the server- Avatar of War, The Emporer, Aten Ha Ra, The Rathe Council, and now Quarm.
<p>In the times ahead, you will see many old players leave and you will see many new faces step up. The spirit of this guild is alive and well, lasting past the small group of ex Storm friends doing Hate Plane raids, and will be carried along in EQ and whatever new MMORPG hits the market. AV is and always will be a group of friends chilling out and killing shit.
<p>I want to thank every member who took my crazy advice and stuck it out to finish off Time. It seemed hopeless and frustrating many times but you guys put the effort in. Thank you, to the members, and to my fellow officers!

<p>This won't be a word-heavy update, because pictures can sometimes say more than words ever can, and this week's awesome  run in Time has left even the notoriously vociferous, well-oiled machine of Ashen Vendetta speechless.  And boy have we  got some nice shots for you!  Believe me, this is stuff worthy of any self-respecting top-shelf porno...
</p>

<p>I mean, we can barely remember our last encounter with a dragon because their existence in PoP is largely minimal  (Aerin`Dar?  WHOOPDEEDOO!).  Size matters?  Check this baby out...

<p align = "center"><img src="/images/10-16-03/Quarm2.jpg"></img></p>

<p>It was getting pretty late in the day by the time we had a chance to test Quarm - so We plinked an arrow over and  sorted out the bodies later for a couple of attempts.  We learned enough to know that he's obviously got issues with  having 4 heads and not enough satisfaction (for each), not to mention being stuck in a lair with not much but stone  walls for company.
</p>

<p>As for loots - first off, grats Gut on a server first Raex BP during our run last week:
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="/images/10-16-03/RaexBP.jpg"></img></p>

<p>All you foot (and umm, hand) fetishists will sadly be denied corpse shots this time round.  However, to make up for it, here's a  selection goodies we've come across - so feel free to feast your eyes on these instead!
</p>

<p><b>Bertox:</b></p>

<p align = "center"><img src="/images/10-16-03/RZLoot.jpg"></img></p>

<p>It's been a long time coming, but the wait will soon be over.  Quarm's imminent death will signal the clearing of  another expansion by AV on Innoruuk, and will surely be one of our most significant achievements, all things  considered.  As usual, there is more than the usual motivations to take us to a higher level:

<p>It's going on 4am as I write this, and I have some shit to do early so I'm keeping this short and to the point.
We made it to stage 5 for the first time and had a chance to play with some new mobs. Two of the wankers got jacked,
some nice loots dropped, and AV advances one step closer to completeing expansion number 4 (LoY doesn't count, I only got some bankspace and guildmembers with bad color coordination).</p>

<p>Only <a href="images/9-30-03/bertoxxtime.JPG">Bertox</a> and <a href="images/9-30-03/innoruuktime.JPG">Innoruuk</a> stood in our way to Quarm late Monday/Early Tuesday, but the hours cought up to us. Trying to learn a mob with people dozing off isn't recommended. It still beats begging other guilds for l33t info via tells.</p>
<p>Planes of Power will be cleared
	soon, ending a summer of retirements and delays of the inevitable. There is going to be some signs posted here soon about crop rotation cause these mobs are gonna get pharmed.</p>

<p>Well, Christmas has seemingly come early for AV since we decided to shop early and avoid the inevitable rush.  Tallon's  gifts were by no means easy to get hold of - bargaining and bartering yielded precious little, therefore we had to  change our approach and literally beat the crap out of him.
</p>
<p>Although initially the beating was being administered mainly by him and the beatees were the majority of our intrepid  troops, slow and steady progress was made over our previous few encounters.  Each time we rallied and regrouped to take  him down that little bit more, culminating in an epic fight a couple of nights back where we somehow defied the  universal killing strat of <b>beating a mob till he has 0% hp</b>.  Yes ladies and gentlemen, his hp was at 0%, the  last people standing even reeled off a couple of nukes in the last acts of defiance.... but still the fucker lived.
</p>
<p>There is nothing sweeter than retribution administered in the most brutal of manners.  Hell hath no fury like an  irrepressible guild scorned, and the blissful taste of vengeance lingered on every AV tongue, savoured to the maximum,  as we stormed his room last night and mercilessly sent him to meet his maker, suffering the loss of two or three  valiant fighters in the process.

<p>Not a moment's rest for the crazy gang - more news coming right at ya!
</p>
<p>We came (a little early), we saw (a lot where the sun don't shine) and we kicked some bootaaay.  There was no evidence  of arboreal growth in the vicinity of Terris' alcove, so we had to content ourselves with pummeling her mercilessly  into the wall, amidst grumbling from the melee classes that she wasn't 100 feet above them and therefore in melee range  (which confused them greatly).  Hence this glorious screenshot of her crumpled hand, mangled in defeat:

<p>It was just our luck that the usual club providing Lapdances and Other Sensual Pleasures for the Discerning Norrathian happened to be shut yesterday evening, so we had to check out the local chicks in Time.  There was some no-contact policy going on in certain areas but we thought, fuck that, we need to get us some action!  Nothing too picky, just your sweet girl-next-door who wants nothing more than no-strings-attached fun.  But oohhhh noooo that would be too simple and easy, right?
</p>
<p>Well what can I say... domesticated and demure this lady was not.  She responded to our presence with nasty scratching, vicious, un-ladylike pummelling, and the summoning of pretty unpleasant minions to help do her bidding.  Bottom line is, Saryrn spends too much time finding worthless creatures to use as playthings, and she clearly needed a taste of her own medicine.  So we turned the tables on her, tattooed <b>AV</b> on her ass and made her our very own bitch.

Turn On, Tune In, Burn Out? --- August 29 - 2003 by <a href="http://ashenvendetta.irongut.100megs4.com/members/profile.php?charID=30">Uvavu</a></center></td>

<p>Once upon a time, the world was a relatively uncomplicated place.  People enjoyed the simple pleasures of life, tilling the soil, quaffing mugs of local brew with fellow farmhands and procreating with reckless abandon; in short, they were happy.  Contentment resulted from routine, and from the knowledge that their perception of the world was totally accurate and unquestioned.
</p>
<p>Of course, the truth is never quite that rosy, and someone once famously summed it up by stating the unfailing certainty that there is nothing more permanent than change.  People get battered from every direction with all manner  of things threatening to destroy the illusion of their own little world which they've created for themselves, and although they resist, deny, and repel, it is inevitable that they eventually either embrace this evolution of sorts, or fall apart.  So it came to pass that our farmers in this little story were uprooted by the winds of change, ushering them into a new era of machinery and industry, and all the while there was this crazy talk going on around them, such as claims that humans could glide through the air, like birds, in vehicles of their own invention.  I'm sure the common folk at the time wondered where they could procure opiates that would also provide them with such flights of fancy.  Now imagine this whole mess against a backdrop of heckling and derision by the majority, and you get a pretty picture all told.  But in the end, those who adapted and moved on continued upwards to newer and greater heights, while those who did not stagnated and retreated to their safe havens of mediocrity.
</p>
<p>Enter the modern day EQ world, where the winds of change are probably blowing harder than at any other time previously.  Forcibly uprooted from our relatively comfortable perch in Time and effectively having to earn our passage once again to the promised land with a crew consisting of faces new and old, we were plunged back into the elemental planes where turmoil was evidently rife.  It’s something we expected and dreaded in equal measures.  But this is something that circumstances forced upon us, and in any case, a little change is good right?
</p>
<p>Well actually, change can kiss my hairy ass, but you just have to suck it up and move on.
</p>
<p><i>A woman walks into a bar.  She goes up to the bartender and asks, “Could you get me a Double Entendre please?”  So he gives her one.
 </i><br>
</p>
<p>Being ahead and setting the pace is like treading a really fine line, and how you perform bears a strong resemblance to a double entendre - it can be interpreted in two very different ways.  Sure, there have been a couple of times in the past month when we’ve totally shot ourselves in the foot and performed embarrassingly.  I can only liken some of our collective performances as a guild to Jim Levenstein – there’ve been a few cases of getting superglue on our hands instead of lubricant and exposing ourselves publicly, one hand on a porno, one hand on our privates.  We live and we learn though - or re-learn as the case may be with certain events.  But if there's one enduring quality about the guild, it's that we don’t get bogged down with negativity; we don’t stagnate and resist change, we pull up our sleeves (and our pants too, hastily) and get on with it.  Through sheer stubbornness of will and the pervasive “fuck losing” mentality in the guild, we got our required wins, in some cases where almost 20% of the raid was botted.  These events have only served to strengthen our fluidity as a killing machine, with the newest additions to the family gelling with us that much more with every passing raid.
</p>
<p>I’m sure some of our failures brought a smirk or two out of the other guilds battling it out in the elemental planes, but on the whole we’ve been fortunate to be able to reach agreements with most parties concerned, and I think we’re all happy to be out of each other’s way for the time being.  I for one am glad that the majority of relationships between Ashen and the other top guilds on the server have remained civil and respectful, some even verging on friendly (<i>*gasp*</i>).  Aside from this, most importantly for us as a guild is that the reflagging sessions have demonstrated our undiminished desire and hunger for raiding and success; furthermore, we have been boosted by some valuable new family members who, I hope, will enjoy a long and fruitful time together with us.
</p>
<p>Enough rambling from me though.  In a way, we’ve missed our old buddies Fennin of the Fugly Mug, Xegony, Luscious Tart of Skimpiness, Sushi-boy Coirnav of the Multiple Appendages and The Gay Rathe Dodecaduplet (whatever) Council - but fuck me sideways if we're going to overstay our welcome in their hovels.  It’s unlikely we’ll be paying them any further visits in the near future.

<p>Anyway, there was a power-cut throughout parts of the city yesterday (East coast US has infected London!) and it rained on my sorry ass when I walked home.  On that note, I think it’s time to call it a day here in case something else decides to go wrong, and let those of you who haven’t fallen asleep reading this go back to spreading much love and quelling the h8.  I myself will start with Lorilei...

<p>Since entering the Plane of Time, we folks at Ashen have dedicated most of our evenings to finding out more about the mysterious place where time is supposedly meaningless, where the lore and treasure are abundant, but where mobs still beg for a beatdown on a regular basis.  So we packed our bags, put on our glad-rags, and pitched our tents in Time - ready to boogie carnival-style to the samba beat of our new playground.
</p>
<p>The lure of summer has enthralled a few of our members, drawing them back into the clutches of the intangible beast known as Real Life, but that hasn't stopped us making slow but steady progress.  The ideas behind the zone are pretty well thought out - if having time limits associated with the different levels of progression throughout Time exudes a glorious self-irony, having to face different types of encounter for each phase at least provides ample variety and interesting fights.  Learning the trials first hand has been fun, and getting through each stage has been rewarding not only in the novelty provided by the next stage, but simply the general feel-good factor of overcoming another hurdle on this seemingly endless race track.  It's the beautiful feeling of reaching second base, knowing you'll slide in on the home plate eventually; the adolescent memories of undoing your lady's bra one-handed, for the very first time, while in the throes of intimate passion; or finding the blow-up sheep of your dreams in a sex shop window... but I digress.

<p>Despite being impeded by the presence of troublesome bards, dwarfs and Lhile, we've managed to enjoy the experience, and even paid Mistress Saryrn our respects in Tier 4 - although sadly I have no screenshots of our encounter.  She wasn't overly receptive to the various chat-up lines thrown her way by amorous suitors (although she did give Yanlaina the eye), and proceeded to tell us how she <b>really</b> felt using that nasty spiked club of hers.  The experience shed a whole new light on the phrase "ripping a new one", although we did put up a pretty good fight even with our limited numbers at the time.  However, to be fair to the lass, being forced to stare at the sinfully ugly mugs of Tallon and Vallon for hours on end would be enough to drive any being, mortal or immortal, to anger and despair at the lack of any satisfaction whatsoever on the horizon.  It's just a pity we didn't put her and her lust-filled loins out of their misery that day.
</p>
<p>Last but not least - mad props to our late night crew, who decided to do the mudman ring in Earth A with just over 20 people, and then felt like feasting on some roast demon (whaddya know, apparently it tastes like chicken) - so the 10 remaining intrepid adventurers went to slap Xuzl silly.  All while half-asleep, dribbling at the mouth, trying not to count the sheep floating through their heads and typing with their toes.  Good on ya guys!

</p>
<p>So there you have it - June and some of July in a nutshell for the guild where yes means yes, and no means yes; where mobs get trampled and all sorts of stuff gets bashed.  (Except for Balrizangor's bishop...)
</p>
<p>Till the next installment, where we find out whether or not Saryrn will finally soften in response to sweet nothings whispered in her ear; whether or not Terris wore any panties back in the day; to confirm or quell the rumour that Tallon is not only Vallon's twin brother, but also his cousin once removed, as well as his grandfather; if it's true that Gut is fat or simply has problems digesting the various gnomes he's eaten; and whether or not Elrie really <b>does</b> nibble.
</p>
<p>Ta ra for now, I'm off to sit in the beautiful sunshine and get burned to a crisp.  Xuzl style.

<p>To expand on my last update, the guild has started scouting the place out. It is always a fun feeling to be seeing a new zone for the first time. 
What you notice right away is that this is not an exp zone (sadly), at least what of it we have seen. Such a <a href="/images/6-01-03/time1.jpg">big empty space you zone into</a>, there
should be exp mobs here for guilds to smack on while forming for raids or an alternative to the crowing the elementals will soon see.

<p>I can't say we have done much there, yet, but the trials seem a welcome change from the Rathe. Some have already fallen to us, and we'll post our progress through these zones.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that I have to make this update brief, as excited as I am about our win, I'm sick as a dog and should be sleeping instead
of writing some web stuff.</p>

<p>So I'm just going to say how much I think this fight sucks, because of a few choices Sony made. Some more small changes would make this fight more bearble and not really easier.
Anyway, we still won, because the Enchanters and Pullers we have stuck it out. At last, we can move on to the final chapter of PoP, the
Plane of Time. I certainly hope the zone is well worth the effort. We shall see soon enough.</p>

<p align="left">Certainly not farming this encounter. Not because the loot isn't worth the effort (well, it really isn't on any Elemental god, because they don'y always drop leg molds). It is because the encounter is just not any fun, at all.
