<p>Since entering the Plane of Time, we folks at Ashen have dedicated most of our evenings to finding out more about the mysterious place where time is supposedly meaningless, where the lore and treasure are abundant, but where mobs still beg for a beatdown on a regular basis.  So we packed our bags, put on our glad-rags, and pitched our tents in Time - ready to boogie carnival-style to the samba beat of our new playground.
</p>
<p>The lure of summer has enthralled a few of our members, drawing them back into the clutches of the intangible beast known as Real Life, but that hasn't stopped us making slow but steady progress.  The ideas behind the zone are pretty well thought out - if having time limits associated with the different levels of progression throughout Time exudes a glorious self-irony, having to face different types of encounter for each phase at least provides ample variety and interesting fights.  Learning the trials first hand has been fun, and getting through each stage has been rewarding not only in the novelty provided by the next stage, but simply the general feel-good factor of overcoming another hurdle on this seemingly endless race track.  It's the beautiful feeling of reaching second base, knowing you'll slide in on the home plate eventually; the adolescent memories of undoing your lady's bra one-handed, for the very first time, while in the throes of intimate passion; or finding the blow-up sheep of your dreams in a sex shop window... but I digress.

</p>
<p>Despite being impeded by the presence of troublesome bards, dwarfs and Lhile, we've managed to enjoy the experience, and even paid Mistress Saryrn our respects in Tier 4 - although sadly I have no screenshots of our encounter.  She wasn't overly receptive to the various chat-up lines thrown her way by amorous suitors (although she did give Yanlaina the eye), and proceeded to tell us how she <b>really</b> felt using that nasty spiked club of hers.  The experience shed a whole new light on the phrase "ripping a new one", although we did put up a pretty good fight even with our limited numbers at the time.  However, to be fair to the lass, being forced to stare at the sinfully ugly mugs of Tallon and Vallon for hours on end would be enough to drive any being, mortal or immortal, to anger and despair at the lack of any satisfaction whatsoever on the horizon.  It's just a pity we didn't put her and her lust-filled loins out of their misery that day.
</p>
<p>Last but not least - mad props to our late night crew, who decided to do the mudman ring in Earth A with just over 20 people, and then felt like feasting on some roast demon (whaddya know, apparently it tastes like chicken) - so the 10 remaining intrepid adventurers went to slap Xuzl silly.  All while half-asleep, dribbling at the mouth, trying not to count the sheep floating through their heads and typing with their toes.  Good on ya guys!

</p>
<p>So there you have it - June and some of July in a nutshell for the guild where yes means yes, and no means yes; where mobs get trampled and all sorts of stuff gets bashed.  (Except for Balrizangor's bishop...)
</p>
<p>Till the next installment, where we find out whether or not Saryrn will finally soften in response to sweet nothings whispered in her ear; whether or not Terris wore any panties back in the day; to confirm or quell the rumour that Tallon is not only Vallon's twin brother, but also his cousin once removed, as well as his grandfather; if it's true that Gut is fat or simply has problems digesting the various gnomes he's eaten; and whether or not Elrie really <b>does</b> nibble.
</p>
<p>Ta ra for now, I'm off to sit in the beautiful sunshine and get burned to a crisp.  Xuzl style.

<p>To expand on my last update, the guild has started scouting the place out. It is always a fun feeling to be seeing a new zone for the first time. 
What you notice right away is that this is not an exp zone (sadly), at least what of it we have seen. Such a <a href="/images/6-01-03/time1.jpg">big empty space you zone into</a>, there
should be exp mobs here for guilds to smack on while forming for raids or an alternative to the crowing the elementals will soon see.

<p>I can't say we have done much there, yet, but the trials seem a welcome change from the Rathe. Some have already fallen to us, and we'll post our progress through these zones.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that I have to make this update brief, as excited as I am about our win, I'm sick as a dog and should be sleeping instead
of writing some web stuff.</p>

<p>So I'm just going to say how much I think this fight sucks, because of a few choices Sony made. Some more small changes would make this fight more bearble and not really easier.
Anyway, we still won, because the Enchanters and Pullers we have stuck it out. At last, we can move on to the final chapter of PoP, the
Plane of Time. I certainly hope the zone is well worth the effort. We shall see soon enough.</p>

<p align="left">Certainly not farming this encounter. Not because the loot isn't worth the effort (well, it really isn't on any Elemental god, because they don'y always drop leg molds). It is because the encounter is just not any fun, at all.
