<p>This won't be a word-heavy update, because pictures can sometimes say more than words ever can, and this week's awesome  run in Time has left even the notoriously vociferous, well-oiled machine of Ashen Vendetta speechless.  And boy have we  got some nice shots for you!  Believe me, this is stuff worthy of any self-respecting top-shelf porno...
</p>

<p>I mean, we can barely remember our last encounter with a dragon because their existence in PoP is largely minimal  (Aerin`Dar?  WHOOPDEEDOO!).  Size matters?  Check this baby out...
</p>

<p align = "center"><img src="/images/10-16-03/Quarm2.jpg"></img></p>

<p>It was getting pretty late in the day by the time we had a chance to test Quarm - so We plinked an arrow over and  sorted out the bodies later for a couple of attempts.  We learned enough to know that he's obviously got issues with  having 4 heads and not enough satisfaction (for each), not to mention being stuck in a lair with not much but stone  walls for company.
</p>

<p>As for loots - first off, grats Gut on a server first Raex BP during our run last week:
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="/images/10-16-03/RaexBP.jpg"></img></p>

<p>All you foot (and umm, hand) fetishists will sadly be denied corpse shots this time round.  However, to make up for it, here's a  selection goodies we've come across - so feel free to feast your eyes on these instead!
</p>

<p><b>Bertox:</b></p>
<p align = "center"><img src="/images/10-16-03/BertLoot.jpg"></img></p>
<p><b>Inny:</b></p>

<p><b>RZ:</b></p>
<p align = "center"><img src="/images/10-16-03/RZLoot.jpg"></img></p>

<p>It's been a long time coming, but the wait will soon be over.  Quarm's imminent death will signal the clearing of  another expansion by AV on Innoruuk, and will surely be one of our most significant achievements, all things  considered.  As usual, there is more than the usual motivations to take us to a higher level:
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="/images/10-16-03/GutQuarmKS.jpg"></img></p>

<p>Next time we'll have a pretty dragon corpse for you to look at - not long now!

<p>It's going on 4am as I write this, and I have some shit to do early so I'm keeping this short and to the point.
We made it to stage 5 for the first time and had a chance to play with some new mobs. Two of the wankers got jacked,
some nice loots dropped, and AV advances one step closer to completeing expansion number 4 (LoY doesn't count, I only got some bankspace and guildmembers with bad color coordination).</p>

<p>Only <a href="images/9-30-03/bertoxxtime.JPG">Bertox</a> and <a href="images/9-30-03/innoruuktime.JPG">Innoruuk</a> stood in our way to Quarm late Monday/Early Tuesday, but the hours cought up to us. Trying to learn a mob with people dozing off isn't recommended. It still beats begging other guilds for l33t info via tells.</p>
<p>Planes of Power will be cleared
	soon, ending a summer of retirements and delays of the inevitable. There is going to be some signs posted here soon about crop rotation cause these mobs are gonna get pharmed.</p>

soon. Next trip I'll have some new pictures as well. Preatty pictures: Ones of Quarm....Dead.</p>

<p>Well, Christmas has seemingly come early for AV since we decided to shop early and avoid the inevitable rush.  Tallon's  gifts were by no means easy to get hold of - bargaining and bartering yielded precious little, therefore we had to  change our approach and literally beat the crap out of him.
</p>
<p>Although initially the beating was being administered mainly by him and the beatees were the majority of our intrepid  troops, slow and steady progress was made over our previous few encounters.  Each time we rallied and regrouped to take  him down that little bit more, culminating in an epic fight a couple of nights back where we somehow defied the  universal killing strat of <b>beating a mob till he has 0% hp</b>.  Yes ladies and gentlemen, his hp was at 0%, the  last people standing even reeled off a couple of nukes in the last acts of defiance.... but still the fucker lived.
</p>
<p>There is nothing sweeter than retribution administered in the most brutal of manners.  Hell hath no fury like an  irrepressible guild scorned, and the blissful taste of vengeance lingered on every AV tongue, savoured to the maximum,  as we stormed his room last night and mercilessly sent him to meet his maker, suffering the loss of two or three  valiant fighters in the process.

<p>Not a moment's rest for the crazy gang - more news coming right at ya!
</p>
<p>We came (a little early), we saw (a lot where the sun don't shine) and we kicked some bootaaay.  There was no evidence  of arboreal growth in the vicinity of Terris' alcove, so we had to content ourselves with pummeling her mercilessly  into the wall, amidst grumbling from the melee classes that she wasn't 100 feet above them and therefore in melee range  (which confused them greatly).  Hence this glorious screenshot of her crumpled hand, mangled in defeat:

<p>It was just our luck that the usual club providing Lapdances and Other Sensual Pleasures for the Discerning Norrathian happened to be shut yesterday evening, so we had to check out the local chicks in Time.  There was some no-contact policy going on in certain areas but we thought, fuck that, we need to get us some action!  Nothing too picky, just your sweet girl-next-door who wants nothing more than no-strings-attached fun.  But oohhhh noooo that would be too simple and easy, right?
</p>
<p>Well what can I say... domesticated and demure this lady was not.  She responded to our presence with nasty scratching, vicious, un-ladylike pummelling, and the summoning of pretty unpleasant minions to help do her bidding.  Bottom line is, Saryrn spends too much time finding worthless creatures to use as playthings, and she clearly needed a taste of her own medicine.  So we turned the tables on her, tattooed <b>AV</b> on her ass and made her our very own bitch.
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/9-03-03/SaryrnDead.jpg" alt="Dead Saryrn"></img>

<p>Not much else to add except that Terris, who was a slightly different kettle of fish altogether (don't even go there), will be going to her favourite realm of La-la-land very shortly.  Permanently.

<p>Keep your eyes peeled, there'll be plenty more to come soon on prime time AVTV.

Turn On, Tune In, Burn Out? --- August 29 - 2003 by <a href="http://ashenvendetta.irongut.100megs4.com/members/profile.php?charID=30">Uvavu</a></center></td>

<p>Once upon a time, the world was a relatively uncomplicated place.  People enjoyed the simple pleasures of life, tilling the soil, quaffing mugs of local brew with fellow farmhands and procreating with reckless abandon; in short, they were happy.  Contentment resulted from routine, and from the knowledge that their perception of the world was totally accurate and unquestioned.
</p>
<p>Of course, the truth is never quite that rosy, and someone once famously summed it up by stating the unfailing certainty that there is nothing more permanent than change.  People get battered from every direction with all manner  of things threatening to destroy the illusion of their own little world which they've created for themselves, and although they resist, deny, and repel, it is inevitable that they eventually either embrace this evolution of sorts, or fall apart.  So it came to pass that our farmers in this little story were uprooted by the winds of change, ushering them into a new era of machinery and industry, and all the while there was this crazy talk going on around them, such as claims that humans could glide through the air, like birds, in vehicles of their own invention.  I'm sure the common folk at the time wondered where they could procure opiates that would also provide them with such flights of fancy.  Now imagine this whole mess against a backdrop of heckling and derision by the majority, and you get a pretty picture all told.  But in the end, those who adapted and moved on continued upwards to newer and greater heights, while those who did not stagnated and retreated to their safe havens of mediocrity.
</p>
<p>Enter the modern day EQ world, where the winds of change are probably blowing harder than at any other time previously.  Forcibly uprooted from our relatively comfortable perch in Time and effectively having to earn our passage once again to the promised land with a crew consisting of faces new and old, we were plunged back into the elemental planes where turmoil was evidently rife.  It’s something we expected and dreaded in equal measures.  But this is something that circumstances forced upon us, and in any case, a little change is good right?
</p>
<p>Well actually, change can kiss my hairy ass, but you just have to suck it up and move on.
</p>
<p><i>A woman walks into a bar.  She goes up to the bartender and asks, “Could you get me a Double Entendre please?”  So he gives her one.
 </i><br>
</p>
<p>Being ahead and setting the pace is like treading a really fine line, and how you perform bears a strong resemblance to a double entendre - it can be interpreted in two very different ways.  Sure, there have been a couple of times in the past month when we’ve totally shot ourselves in the foot and performed embarrassingly.  I can only liken some of our collective performances as a guild to Jim Levenstein – there’ve been a few cases of getting superglue on our hands instead of lubricant and exposing ourselves publicly, one hand on a porno, one hand on our privates.  We live and we learn though - or re-learn as the case may be with certain events.  But if there's one enduring quality about the guild, it's that we don’t get bogged down with negativity; we don’t stagnate and resist change, we pull up our sleeves (and our pants too, hastily) and get on with it.  Through sheer stubbornness of will and the pervasive “fuck losing” mentality in the guild, we got our required wins, in some cases where almost 20% of the raid was botted.  These events have only served to strengthen our fluidity as a killing machine, with the newest additions to the family gelling with us that much more with every passing raid.
</p>
<p>I’m sure some of our failures brought a smirk or two out of the other guilds battling it out in the elemental planes, but on the whole we’ve been fortunate to be able to reach agreements with most parties concerned, and I think we’re all happy to be out of each other’s way for the time being.  I for one am glad that the majority of relationships between Ashen and the other top guilds on the server have remained civil and respectful, some even verging on friendly (<i>*gasp*</i>).  Aside from this, most importantly for us as a guild is that the reflagging sessions have demonstrated our undiminished desire and hunger for raiding and success; furthermore, we have been boosted by some valuable new family members who, I hope, will enjoy a long and fruitful time together with us.
</p>
<p>Enough rambling from me though.  In a way, we’ve missed our old buddies Fennin of the Fugly Mug, Xegony, Luscious Tart of Skimpiness, Sushi-boy Coirnav of the Multiple Appendages and The Gay Rathe Dodecaduplet (whatever) Council - but fuck me sideways if we're going to overstay our welcome in their hovels.  It’s unlikely we’ll be paying them any further visits in the near future.

<p>I was going to post something side-splittingly witty about VI’s awesome implementation of a certain illusion, but they’ve fixed it (isn't this update just full of surprises?).  I broke my funny bone last week anyway so you'll just have to deal with watered-down dullness.

On that note, I think it’s time to call it a day here in case something else decides to go wrong, and let those of you who haven’t fallen asleep reading this go back to spreading much love and quelling the h8.

<p>Since entering the Plane of Time, we folks at Ashen have dedicated most of our evenings to finding out more about the mysterious place where time is supposedly meaningless, where the lore and treasure are abundant, but where mobs still beg for a beatdown on a regular basis.  So we packed our bags, put on our glad-rags, and pitched our tents in Time - ready to boogie carnival-style to the samba beat of our new playground.
</p>
<p>The lure of summer has enthralled a few of our members, drawing them back into the clutches of the intangible beast known as Real Life, but that hasn't stopped us making slow but steady progress.  The ideas behind the zone are pretty well thought out - if having time limits associated with the different levels of progression throughout Time exudes a glorious self-irony, having to face different types of encounter for each phase at least provides ample variety and interesting fights.  Learning the trials first hand has been fun, and getting through each stage has been rewarding not only in the novelty provided by the next stage, but simply the general feel-good factor of overcoming another hurdle on this seemingly endless race track.  It's the beautiful feeling of reaching second base, knowing you'll slide in on the home plate eventually; the adolescent memories of undoing your lady's bra one-handed, for the very first time, while in the throes of intimate passion; or finding the blow-up sheep of your dreams in a sex shop window... but I digress.

</p>
<p>Despite being impeded by the presence of troublesome bards, dwarfs and Lhile, we've managed to enjoy the experience, and even paid Mistress Saryrn our respects in Tier 4 - although sadly I have no screenshots of our encounter.  She wasn't overly receptive to the various chat-up lines thrown her way by amorous suitors (although she did give Yanlaina the eye), and proceeded to tell us how she <b>really</b> felt using that nasty spiked club of hers.  The experience shed a whole new light on the phrase "ripping a new one", although we did put up a pretty good fight even with our limited numbers at the time.  However, to be fair to the lass, being forced to stare at the sinfully ugly mugs of Tallon and Vallon for hours on end would be enough to drive any being, mortal or immortal, to anger and despair at the lack of any satisfaction whatsoever on the horizon.  It's just a pity we didn't put her and her lust-filled loins out of their misery that day.
</p>
<p>Last but not least - mad props to our late night crew, who decided to do the mudman ring in Earth A with just over 20 people, and then felt like feasting on some roast demon (whaddya know, apparently it tastes like chicken) - so the 10 remaining intrepid adventurers went to slap Xuzl silly.  All while half-asleep, dribbling at the mouth, trying not to count the sheep floating through their heads and typing with their toes.  Good on ya guys!

</p>
<p>So there you have it - June and some of July in a nutshell for the guild where yes means yes, and no means yes; where mobs get trampled and all sorts of stuff gets bashed.  (Except for Balrizangor's bishop...)
</p>
<p>Till the next installment, where we find out whether or not Saryrn will finally soften in response to sweet nothings whispered in her ear; whether or not Terris wore any panties back in the day; to confirm or quell the rumour that Tallon is not only Vallon's twin brother, but also his cousin once removed, as well as his grandfather; if it's true that Gut is fat or simply has problems digesting the various gnomes he's eaten; and whether or not Elrie really <b>does</b> nibble.
</p>
<p>Ta ra for now, I'm off to sit in the beautiful sunshine and get burned to a crisp.  Xuzl style.

<p>To expand on my last update, the guild has started scouting the place out. It is always a fun feeling to be seeing a new zone for the first time. 
What you notice right away is that this is not an exp zone (sadly), at least what of it we have seen. Such a <a href="/images/6-01-03/time1.jpg">big empty space you zone into</a>, there
should be exp mobs here for guilds to smack on while forming for raids or an alternative to the crowing the elementals will soon see.

<p>I can't say we have done much there, yet, but the trials seem a welcome change from the Rathe. Some have already fallen to us, and we'll post our progress through these zones.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that I have to make this update brief, as excited as I am about our win, I'm sick as a dog and should be sleeping instead
of writing some web stuff.</p>

<p>So I'm just going to say how much I think this fight sucks, because of a few choices Sony made. Some more small changes would make this fight more bearble and not really easier.
Anyway, we still won, because the Enchanters and Pullers we have stuck it out. At last, we can move on to the final chapter of PoP, the
Plane of Time. I certainly hope the zone is well worth the effort. We shall see soon enough.</p>

<p align="left">Certainly not farming this encounter. Not because the loot isn't worth the effort (well, it really isn't on any Elemental god, because they don'y always drop leg molds). It is because the encounter is just not any fun, at all.
