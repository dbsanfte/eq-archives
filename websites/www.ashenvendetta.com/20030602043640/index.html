<p>To expand on my last update, the guild has started scouting the place out. It is always a fun feeling to be seeing a new zone for the first time. 
What you notice right away is that this is not an exp zone (sadly), at least what of it we have seen. Such a <a href="/images/6-01-03/time1.jpg">big empty space you zone into</a>, there
should be exp mobs here for guilds to smack on while forming for raids or an alternative to the crowing the elementals will soon see.

<p>I'm sorry that I have to make this update brief, as excited as I am about our win, I'm sick as a dog and should be sleeping instead
of writing some web stuff.</p>

<p>So I'm just going to say how much I think this fight sucks, because of a few choices Sony made. Some more small changes would make this fight more bearble and not really easier.
Anyway, we still won, because the Enchanters and Pullers we have stuck it out. At last, we can move on to the final chapter of PoP, the
Plane of Time. I certainly hope the zone is well worth the effort. We shall see soon enough.</p>

<p>We are on a roll. Night one, we off Xegony and Fennin. Night two, we take
  out Mystical Arbitor so we can go play with The Rathe. Night three, it was
  time to take a swim down to zap Coirnav. We figured, why not, lets kill 'em
  all in three nights. He has evaded us long
enough!</p>
<p>This is a tricky encounter, and the margin for error is quite small. We've
  had him down a good deal before only to see a loss. Not tonight, everything
  clicked, everyone stepped it up and The Avatar of Water was sunk.</p>

 <p>I'm here to toss up a new update for the sake of putting something current
   up, even if I don't have anything major to post. Corinav continues to (barely)
   elude us, and Sony changes Plane of Earth just about every week. Seems like
   they fixed it this time,
   the Mystical Arbitor of Earth is going to get dropped. </p>
 <p>Every thing else has been cake. We nailed Fennin the other night without
   loosing a single person. They should have given him an upgrade along with
   the mini-bosses in Fire. Next time we are going to fight him while under the
   influence just for a challenge.</p>

At long last, the fruits of creating a strategy  to
  defeat a tough encounter pays off. Xegony, Queen of Air is by far the hardest
  EQ encounter
  we have faced
  and defeated.
  Just getting to her spawn location was hard, but the fight itself is one of
  the reasons to play EQ... Its exciting: The whole fight you are not sure if
  you will win or loose.
  <p>After many frustrating battles, she was finally put down. The entire guild
  takes part and everyone was masterful. The margin for error is almost nothing
  with her; yet Ashen Vendetta triumphs tonight. Very tough, very fun and the
    whole encounter has a massive pucker factor.</p>
  <p>We have two Elemental Deities
      dead, and we'll soon add number 3. I hope you all like sushi.</p>  <p align="center"><img src="images/3-13-03/xegony%202.jpg" width="500" height="330"></p>

  <p>She coughed up a veritable caster's wet dream. There were two of these wands
  and an Elemental Silk Leggings mold:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/3-13-03/nadi.jpg" width="255" height="365"></p>
  <p align="left">Xegony has taken up a considerable amount of our time, as has
  flagging members who have been away and new recruits. On top of that we've
    put down a host of other named in just about every zone. It isn't exactly
    worthy of an update, but we are chugging along just fine towards Plane of
    Time. It is nice to kill mobs without relying on spoilers.</p>
  <p align="left">Until next time and remember to support our troops!</p></td>
