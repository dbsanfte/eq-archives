<p>Ashen Vendetta would like to congratulate StPauli on the first Epic 2.0 for the guild!</p>
<img src="http://www.ashenvendetta.com/avnews/MAR06/stp.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Well deserved!</p>

<p>After a nasty and long round of recruiting/re-flagging Ashen Vendetta is once again stomping around in the Fortress of Solitude (aka.. Citadel of Anguish) like we own the place. I for one would just like to say... it's good to be back. After doing the Specialization trial for what seemed like the millionth time, things finally clicked and we KTFO'd the mob with only 2 deaths.</p>

<p>It's funny, looking back on this trial, the first time we did it we won without much trouble or preparation at all... we didnt have a full raid and we didnt even expect to win... but we did. On this round of reflagging this trial was becoming my personal albatross, we just couldn't seem to get things in synch for the win. I was beginning to lose hope. Tuesday night though my guildmates dug a little deeper, after a couple weeks of waiting we were all tired of this trial, I made promises to my guildmates that I wont disclose here... lets just say baby oil, woodland creatures and pop rocks are involved... but I digress. The point is we came through.</p>

<p>After the win spirits were high and the Asskicking wasnt anywhere near done for the evening, no good readers... we were just getting started. We moved into the Fortress of Solitude and started clearing house with a vengance... no, a Vendetta. Chaos Incorporated was back and ready to make some noise. We started off by stomping a muddhole in Tures a$$, and then moved on to see the Warden, killing everything along the way. Ture was old hat for us but the Warden was some new hotness that we hadn't faced before. We left a splatter mark and not much else.</p>

<img src="http://www.ashenvendetta.com/avnews/MAR06/orbbox.jpg">

<p>Make no mistake, Chaos Incorporated has been dormant for a while, but we are up and moving again. We only move in 1 direction and that's forward. Get out the tractor and my overalls Ethel, it's farm time.</p>

<p>And the beat goes on...</p>

<p>Hrm... it's 10-18... Not a good number normally.  Remember when 1018 meant that you were @!#$@ for the next 10 to 18 minutes?  I do.  But incase you forgot:</p>
<img src="http://www.ashenvendetta.com/gallery/quotes/1018.jpg"><br><br>

<p>Well, 10-18 was a good day for Ashen Vendetta.  Trial of Endurance: owned.</p>
<a href="images/10-18/endurance.jpg"><img src="images/10-18/enduranceSmall.jpg" border="0"></a><br>
<p>So after some fine tuning we got Endurance down.  It was quite a satisfying victory, given that we'd spent so much time working on it.  So when the Ancients in the trial went down, a great deal of folks got this:</p>
<br><img src="images/10-18/masteryofall.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<p>Though I, being the slacker that I am missed Foresight, but that was okay, because after owning Endurance, we owned Foresight again next.</p>

<p>Well, it's been a while since I've updated the 'ol webpage, but I shall cease slacking for a moment to take the time to do so now.</p>
<p>Lately, Ashen Vendetta has been enjoying the spoils of Tacvi and Yar`Lir, but tonight we decided to try some different stuff, and made our way to Muramite Proving Grounds and did some trials.  End result is that Ashen Vendetta is now 1/3rd of the way to Anguish in one evening, and it wont be long until we'll be farming there too.</p>
<a href="images/9-27-05/masterhate2.jpg"><img src="images/9-27-05/masterhateSmall.jpg" border="0"></a><br>
<i>The Master of Hatred goes down and becomes Ashen's first MPG raid victory!</i>
<br>
<p>So, after we completed the Mastery of Mind, we decided our rogues needed daggers and made our way to Realms to lay waste to Adaptation.  I'd say we adapted fairly well.</p>
<a href="images/9-27-05/Adaptation.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/9-27-05/AdaptationSmall.jpg" border="0"></a><br>
<i>Not the most glorious picture, I know... but you get the idea!</i>
<br><br>
<img src="images/9-27-05/MPGRunes.jpg" border="0"><br>
<i>Yay for runes!</i>
<br>
<p>Also I have a message to you sick sons of bitches that decided what Innoruuk and Kessdona were going to drop for us:  After over a dozen time clearings since we reformed we got not a single Jagged Time Forged Blade.  After nearly 20 Kessdona clearings we got 1 Fang, which was months ago.  Whoever you are, fuck you.  I hope Tryol and Mindori stick their new Soulskives in your back and make you suffer before you die, jackass!</p>

<p>And now for some other randomness:</p>

<p>Last night was a night of victory for Ashen Vendetta, as we successfuly brought down Zun`Muram Tkarish Zyk and Yar`Lir the Matriarch that changes names.</p>
<p>Big props to everyone that took part in the fight last night (I was slacking and logged in late, just as he was down to 40ish~).  Ashen Vendetta has spent a lot of time in Txevu learning this encounter, and finally our presistance and drive has paid off with access to Tacvi, the Seat of the Slaver.</p>
<a href="images/9-30/txevuzun.jpg"><img src="images/9-30/txevuzunSmall.jpg" border="0"></a><br>
<i>This just in: a decent picture of the dead Zun~  Indeed, victory is truly ours with a naked Frostfyre to boot!</i>
<br>
<p>Then, after our victory over the Muramites in Txevu, we shifted gears and made our way towards Thundercrest Isles and brought down Yar`Lir.</p>
<a href="images/9-30/YarLirBig1.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/9-30/YarLirSmall1.jpg" border="0"></a><br>
<i>Blue Dragon needs food badly! Blue Dragon is about to die! (Insert Coin!)</i>

<i>Yar`Lir: "Potatowned" as Master Samwise would say</i>
<br>
<p>So, a dead Muramite and a dead dragon makes for a good night for AV - with plenty more ass kicking coming soon!</p>
<br>
<img src="images/9-30/Yar2.jpg">
<br><i>Another great shot of Yar`Lir for good measure</i><br>
<p>Also, during the Yar`Lir fight, our hobbit detective Rykie was on the look out for saboteurs, and the <a href="images/9-30/wyllo.jpg" border="0">evil paladin's</a> secret plot was discovered.  However, the angry dwarves quickly put down the rebellion.</p>

<p>Well, I know I said last update that I'd have Uvavu's corpse on here, but unfortunately he's been doing the killing instead of being killed... Hah! Foiled your plans again, evil sorcerer! Er, wait...</p>
<p>He got this here goat:</p>
<a href="images/8-3/GoatBig.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/8-3/GoatSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>And this poor monk with the yellow Camaro:</p>
<a href="images/8-3/WhipBig.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/8-3/WhipSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>So, as you can see we've been hanging out in Txevu lately, we got the High Priest the other night as well, so just Tkarish stands between Ashen Vendetta and Tacvi, and we learned a good bit about him tonight.  It wont be long now!</p>

<a href="images/8-3/HPBig.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/8-3/HPsmall.jpg" border="0"></a>

<p>But!  We've been doing other stuff aside from being violated by, and killing, angry goats in Txevu.  We've also been doing the normal fun-times, like dragon slaying.  We've been working on a new dragon for us too, this one:</p>

<a href="images/8-3/yar.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/8-3/yarSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>While this isn't our best attempt at her, it is still an awesome shot of her (notice how she's going to devour that d0rf laying on the floor there, slacking!)  So anyway, stay tuned for more!  </p>

<p>So as I'm sure you all know, I'm a slacker and only update the front page when the rest of the guild bugs me to do so.. and so here's the update:</p>
<p>The other day Noqufiel got knocked the fuck out by Ashen Vendetta, granting us access to Txevu (Zeh-voo), the Lair of the Elites... impressive name I know, but we'll see just how elite stuff is in there real soon.  I'm sure the designers were thinking, "Hey I know, let's make up some weird and nearly unpronounceable names for these zones and give them cool subtitles!".   Anyway, that's an old rant, enough of that...</p>
<a href="images/7-1/noqufiel.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/7-1/NoqufielSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>Inktu`ta is my new favorite zone.  Talk about some crazy events in there - but hey, I wont argue with free loot!  Noqufiel was especially fun, up until someone slacked and I got death touched at 0%... so Ferreus was kind enough to provide the above screen shot for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>I promise I'll have a more interesting picture up here next week... Like Uvavu's corpse... that hasn't made the front page in a long time! ;(</p>

<p>So, now that Kessdona and Rikkukin are farm status, we decided to go try something new.  The Queen in Riftseeker's Sanctum seemed like a good target.</p>
<p>We gathered our forces and marched into the crystaline tower and unleashed hell.  First attempt at the Queen got her to 2% health.  It was close, but we know she was toast next time.  Second try we got her - potatowned as Master Samwise would say.</p>
<a href="images/6-7/QueenDead.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/6-7/QueenSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>I have to say, our healing team has come a long way since we started reflagging for Time.  They were really on form last night, and it showed.</p>
<p>Expect to see the King's corpse on this webpage shortly, as well.</p>

<p>Well, it's been a while since we've updated the webpage, but that doesn't mean we've been sitting around doing nothing. We've been quite busy.  So far The Nameless has been an interesting server, but we've been kicking ass here just the same as we did on Innoruuk.</p>
<p>So anyway, I like pictures (don't you?), so here's quick recap of what's been going on with us:</p>
<a href="images/6-1/Kelekdrix.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/6-1/KelekdrixSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>This guy (gal) had been giving us some trouble, but now she's dead.  We also got the Stonemite Ring while we were there.  Weirdness.</p>
<p>Oh, we've also been killing my favorite creatures: Dragons.  Kessdona and Rikkukin both have gone splat by Ashen Vendetta</p>
<a href="images/6-1/Rikkukin.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/6-1/RikkukinSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<br>
<a href="images/6-1/Kessdona.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/6-1/KessdonaSmall.jpg" border="0"></a>
<br>
<p>Not very glorious pictures I know, but Less, our new guild photographer (and scape goat) got a good one of Rikkukin.</p>
<a href="images/6-1/RikkukinBig.jpg" border="0"><img src="images/6-1/RikkukinBigThumb.jpg" border="0"></a>
<p>Kessdona looks about the same as Rikkukin, just imagine that the dragon is gold instead of platinum.</p>
