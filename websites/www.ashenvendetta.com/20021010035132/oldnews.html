		<p class="detailsBold">Although I personally enjoyed the patch and server 
reset spawns, there comes a point when it starts to get old. Enter Vex Thall, 
we had to avoid this place during Innoruuk's spasms. Logging people at a point 
just when the zone is getting good (the mobs that don't suck) only to have the 
server reset can be frustrating beyond anything in EQ. Goes with the territory 
I suppose.
<p align="center" class="detailsBold"><img src="images/innoruuk.jpg" width="360" height="254"><br>
<em>&quot;We are out of coffee, oh btw Innoruuk is down again.&quot;</em>
<p class="detailsBold">The gods of stability granted the players of Innoruuk some 
time this week to get things done. 
<p class="detailsBold">Before I get into the usual slew of ss loot/dead mobs, 
I'd like to take the time to say what an outstanding job the boys and girls of 
AV have done against the Emperor the last two times. Back to back 54 person kills, 
at times pulling victory from certain defeat. It doesn't get any more intense 
than that kind of a fight. Great job :)
<p class="detailsBold">Now onto the important matters, i.e. the good stuff. 
<p class="detailsBold">Vex Thall. You've read about it many places, including 
here. About what needs changed, upgraded, etc. Even though the zone only got a 
weeks preparation from VI, the zone its extremely demanding. Rumor is that the 
zone is getting looked at, that loot will get upgraded. With just the right tweaks 
in a few areas the zone will be quite entertaining until Planes of Power is released.

<em>Ever wondered who Pain and Suffering was?</em>
<p class="detailsBold">In just two days AV tore through the zone and clearing 
it before some chromosome-challenged intern at Sony HQ could trip the circuit 
breaker. For the most part, each boss went down without much difficulty. Except 
for Aten, who gave us some fits there for a bit. After some adjustments, pulled 
the big lass and all was well. The only people to die were those that 10k'd from 
the fuxored flux. 
<p class="detailsBold">It felt good to add Aten Ha Ra to the Emp and Aow for mobs 
we have killed not loosing the MT. You don't need hordes of people or 10+ Wizards 
when your clerics fucking own.
<p class="detailsBold">Speaking of Clerics that own, the man the Rensak loves 
to heckle will get a reprieve this update.
<p align="center" class="detailsBold"><img src="images/wolves.jpg" width="358" height="531"><br>
Or not.
<p class="detailsBold">The Aten Ha Ra kill capped off a fast and furious clearing 
of VT, and she rewarded us with some kick ass loot.

<em>Commence thy drool.</em>

and destruction. This guild has continued to impress, in every way.

      <p class="detailsBold">   Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too?  </p>
	
	<p>Nothing new on this front, kill this, kill that, die to bugs here, die to bugs there. 
	Innoruuk is up, nope Innoruuk is down, no Innoruuk is up, o look Innoruuk us down.
	For the love of god, take it down for a day and fix the shit.</p>
	
	<p>Here's my favorite of the week to due with the server "stability".  After finishing 
	off some containers in Akheva, the server crashes.  After 30 minutes I go to bed because 
	its late, no telling when the server will be back up.  When I log in the next day I immediately
	LD thanks to the awesome patch that someone forgot to include the .bmp file... great job on that one.
	So when I finally get back on i'm buck naked at my bind. I think to myself, hell no i'm not going to 
	run back to Akheva and drag my own corpse and make a cleric come out and res me. I'm going to make a 
	fucking GM take 2 minutes out of his time before the server crashes again, go to Akheva, summon my 
	corpse, and res my ass with a GM res. So the conversation starts off something like this.</p>

	<p>/petition Due to the server crashing last night,  I died when I logged in today. I would appreciate
	 a summon and res when you have time.</p>
	<p>(1 hour later)</p>
	<p>Dork tells you, 'Hail this is Guide dumbfuck, how can I help you today!</p>
	<p>you tell dork, '...'</p>
	<p>Dork tells you, 'Hello there, I am guide dumbfuck, how may I help you?!?'</p>
	<p>you tell Dork, 'ok, did you read my petition that I sent?'</p>
	<p>Dork tells you, 'I am here aren't I ?  How can I help you today?!'</p>
	<p>you tell Dork, 'ok, ill start over then.  Last night the server crashed around 1:15am cst, my group 
	was in akheva near IV getting containers for VT keys, server was down awhile so I just went to bed.
	I logged in this afternoon and thanks to the fine quality patch that was pushed that forgot a file, I
	immediately crashed to desktop, once I got the patch problem resolved I logged back in to find myself dead 
	at my bind point. I'd like a summon and res from Akheva when your free.'</p>
	<p>Dork tells you, 'one moment'</p>
	<p>(15 minutes)</p>
	<p>Dork tells you, 'I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do, no one knows anything about the server crashing last night'
	<p>You tell Dork, 'don't start with me.  Look at your log files, Innoruuk server is like a cold 2 day 
	old turd at the moment, it's been crashing everyday for a freaking week, and it crashed last night at 1:15cst'
	<p>Dork tells you, 'Sorry, I talked to everyone around me here and they all said they don't think it crashed 
	last night, have a good day!'
	<p>(10 mins of me deciding if I am going to make this dipshit cry or if I should get it escalated... I chose the latter)</p>
	<p>You tell Dork, 'So I assume you are considering this matter closed?'</p>
	<p>Dork tells you, 'I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do, the server did not crash last night'</p>
	<p>You tell Dork, 'I'll expect an apology from you soon, escalate this petition to a lead gm now.'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'Hail, and well met. What can I do for you today?'</p>
	<p>You tell LeadDork, 'Long story short. Check your logs, the server crashed last night at 1:15am cst, I died 
	because of the server crashing in Akheva. I'd like a summon and a res because of the server crashing.  Your GM,
	not a guide, is trying to tell me that the server did not crash last night. If the server
	did not crash, that would be odd, because red LOCKED next to the server name tells me that the server isn't online'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'One moment'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'Ok, I verified the server was down last night, let me port to Akheva and get you ressed'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'I'm sorry, you don't have any corpses in Akheva'</p>
	<p>You tell LeadDork, 'don't try it... look again.'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'oops, I was misspelling your name hehe'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'ok, i'll have to summon you here, then I will have to manually reset your experience bar'</p>
	<p>(customer service res)</p>
	<p>(loot corpse)</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'dont loot all of your corpse yet, i'm trying to find out how to reset your experience'</p>
	<p>You tell LeadDork, 'you already did, it happens with the CS res.'</p>
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'o, really?  I didn't know that'</p>
	<p>You tell LeadDork, 'Do me a favor, and tell GMDork that the server crashed last night, so no one else gets the same BS
	 I went through when he tries to tell them the server didn't crash last night'
	<p>LeadDork tells you, 'It's already been one. I informed him as soon as I checked the logs and verified that the server crashed'</p>

	
	<p>So that took 2 hours of my time. I should have just ran my ass back there and did it myself and saved the hassle.  But 
	there is something called principle.  Don't tell me the server didn't crash you moron unless you talk to someone who was 
	actually there, and not try to piss people off and take the easy way out and hope they will just go away.  The CS for
	EQ is utterly horrible, a fucking trained monkey could do a better job than what is going on in EQ right now.  Whoever is 
	running your CS is a moron.  "New and Improved Floating GM's" what a novel idea	it's just a shame that's an excuse to 
	funnel semi half assed support away from where it's needed to god knows where, Stormhammer? Tech Support? Maybe you needed
	them to drive that fucking van you're driving around the country trying to give away free accounts.  Whatever you're doing 
	with the CS, or lack of it, you are doing a shitty job.</p>

	<p>Ok, enough of my ranting. EQ is going to hell in a handbasket if the live team doesn't get off their ass and make some
	 tough decisions.  All you casters should probably go read this thread <A HREF="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=b68b4a4ecbbcd46ef2ee386487686b18&threadid=2252">Manapool</A>

<br> <p>Enough of that, we've been busy busy in Vex Thal, trying to convince everyone 
that AE blind is their friend, and TDU is their enemy. We peeked our heads out 
of VT recently a bit to knock off another High Priest, AoW, Emperor Ssraeshza. 
Emperor is on our farm club, we're hoping one day he'll be in the major leagues 
again.</p>
<br> <p>Sometimes my bank get's full, so I need to make room <img src="/buffe/callerdes.jpg">

<br> <p>We're thinking about just giving all our extra power sources to the newest

they are finally close to killing one of the easiest mobs in the high end game 
now <A href=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7830>Vyzh'dra the

<p>But no, sadly we won't team up with you to kill Emperor Ssraeshza, <img src="/buffe/oricalum-emp.jpg">

not involve coffins. We have had 3 really great trains that I can remember. These 
are the type of trains where a few lucky people get insta-gibbed and get sent 
right to the bazaar, while the rest of us die slow painful deaths while we vainly

<p>With the normal update guy on a vacation, I will fill you in on what we are 
doing. We are still playing with time sinks, and The Emporer. Over Memorial Day 
weekend, we took down the High Priest with 48 and Arch Lich with 43. What made 
it fun was having twinks being played to fill in spots for folks who were chomping 
down BBQ and beer, and a few guests... don't know how we pulled it off, but we 
did :)</p>
<p> Sunday, we added an early bird special, Cazic Thule, then proceed on to take 
out IV and Shei Vinitras in Ahkeva. Very nice drops, even though one of our own

<p>The High Priest encounter got tuned a little this last patch. A fight that 
lasted 31 Minutes, Including one point in the middle where The High Priest got 
Complete Healed from 40% health to 70% health. This battle was one of the most 
Intense fights I have been in. Twice the call of "were fucked!" was made. Yet 
somehow we managed to pull it out for a win. Great work by all. Oh yeah we dropped 
Xerkish "I'm still a pussy" Creator and Arch Lich sometime this week too. All 
this key & wepon camping in SSra kind of blurs it all together!</p>
