            <p>Here is a rather long personal retrospective. </p>
            <p>Looking back to where Ashen Vendetta was a year ago, I realize 
              not only how far we have come (in terms of teamwork and success), 
              but how far the game has progressed. For better or worse, Everquest 
              continues to be a big part of all our members lives (sometimes to 
              detriment to school or work!) and we can all agree it has been one 
              of our favorite hobbies since its inception.</p>
            <p>This year we continued to build on what started as nothing more 
              than a few friends and an idea of fun first; after all that is why 
              so many of us continue to log in. This group continued to grow, 
              and eventually became not only friends, but veterans of the high 
              level game. Let me reflect on some of our highlights.</p>
            <p>In December of last year we were still killing Trakanon fairly 
              regularly, working towards entering Veeshans Peak. Velious was out 
              but we stayed with our goal, even if other folks on the server were 
              getting somewhat better equipment for much less risk. In March, 
              just one month after entering the zone, we killed every dragon there.</p>
            <p>In hindsight I'm glad we stuck to our goal; people do not get remembered 
              for pharming the first set of PoG armor, but I can assure you my 
              fellow guildmates will never forget killing Phara Dar for the first 
              time. It was more sweet, not for being the first (there are many 
              guilds out there that have been first more times), but for rewarding 
              us all for the hard work and sacrifice. Also, watching all those 
              foolish naysayers eat their collective words. To this day, only 
              2 guilds on Innoruuk have cleared this zone. Just 2.</p>
            <p>In the months that followed, realization was that we had only really 
              scratched the surface of Velious. Most of the encounters were much 
              different than that quick bloody battles of Kunark, these fights 
              required the now infamous main tank. Mobs were given huge huge amounts 
              of hitpoints. The officers and guildmembers hashed out strategies 
              on the fly and we got to work. We also recruited some very good 
              people, that are still with us today. A consequence of super SoV 
              encounters; one that has added greatly to our guild.</p>
            <p>Compared to the other top guilds on the server, we were not as 
              well equipped, or uber mobs slain; what we did not lack was determination 
              and teamwork. Many folks said we could not handle the beasts of 
              Velious. Those creatures started to drop like flies at our hands. 
              The summertime began with mobs like Dain, Vindicator, and all of 
              the West Wing Temple of Veeshan dragons.</p>
            <p>Also, who can forget the infamous Yelinak slayings of early summer. 
              AV and our friends The Pantheon were mocked and what not, for two 
              guilds that often before fought and raced against each other for 
              mobs, working together to do something big. Everyone knew the mob 
              (Yelinak at the time was nothing like he is now) required less people, 
              but almost everyone from both guilds were excited about working 
              together. Some people, in both guilds did not like this idea. That 
              is why it was something unique, something I will never forget.</p>
            <p>Still there were some that continued to use every opportunity to 
              try and discredit us, many of them at one time were friends that 
              had moved onto other guilds. We did joint raids a few more times, 
              but two guilds with much different styles of combat and leadership 
              just didn't work well in an encounter sense, but we all appreciate 
              the fun and friendships forged those days.</p>
            <p>Since then we have killed Yelinak with just our guild more times 
              than I can remember. The dragon has been upgraded time and time 
              again; and still he fell. Today, Yelinak is the hardest dragon known 
              (besides the unkillable Sleeper or Jaled) in my opinion, much tougher 
              than Vyemm. With only 43 people, last night we dropped Lord Yelinak 
              with zero casualties.</p>
            <p>The end of the summer found us finally gathering enough sleeper 
              tomb keys to finally enter and face the warders. Those key gathering 
              days were hectic, and quite monotonous; we had no luxury of the 
              old 24 hour Klandicar and Zlandicar spawns. We fought over those 
              two dragons frequently with other guilds. Then Klandicar was upgraded, 
              and we still beat his ass into the dirt. What is most enjoyable 
              is that AV got most of its keys for much harder foes; Sontalak, 
              Lendinaria, and Yelinak. We fought hard for every key.</p>
            <p>We knew that eventually the Sleeper would be freed. It was important 
              for us to take part in such a server wide event, do tackle Ventani 
              first. The time had come, once again, to reap the rewards and thrills 
              of doing something epic, to see those hard many months of gathering 
              sleeper tomb keys pay off.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we had decided on a whim to kill him, not really 
              thinking about a strategy ahead of time. It took three fights to 
              realize that Ventanni was not quite the monster we thought before. 
              We had a plan, a plan that we executed flawlessly. The excitement 
              and pride was palpable, every guildmate both there and supporting 
              through guildchat (those not lucky enough to have a key yet) added 
              something. With the dragon dead at our feet, we watched with delight 
              as The Sleeper tore through our ranks and continue on to other zones.</p>
            <p>Many say it was because of the new patch that allowed him to be 
              slowed that we won. Our clerics had quite a lot of mana at the end 
              of the fight. Ventanni wasn't slowed until he was at 45% health 
              or so. Only a handful of people died. It truly was one of the most 
              epic battles I have ever been apart of in EQ, and one that any witnessed 
              would not soon forget.</p>
            <p>The end of the year was mainly killing in The North Temple of Veeshan, 
              the SoV faction leaders, and trying out strategies on the ultra 
              mobs (AoW, Tunare). The release of SoL has thrown us a curve, as 
              I'm sure it has for many other guilds, but I look forward to the 
              new challenges this expansion holds for us.</p>
            <p>I'm very grateful to be apart of Ashen Vendetta, part of a solid 
              group of friends and seeing so many great victories. As Everquest 
              continues to evolve, we will see many good people come and go. As 
              long as the game holds something special for all of us, may we continue 
              to see goals met, and new boundaries crossed in 2002.</p>
            <p>Best wishes for the new year to all of my fellow guild brothers 
              and sisters, and to those of you who stop by and read all of my 
              silly ramblings! </p>
