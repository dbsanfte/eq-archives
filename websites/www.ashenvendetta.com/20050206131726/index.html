<center><p>So, last night we were in every melee class's (especially rogues) favorite zone, the Plane of Water. Why would we go to such a zone you ask?  Because word had gotten out that our friend Quarm was craving some seafood.  So, like any friend would do, we went out and delivered - right to his door step.</p>
<br></br>

<br><BR>
<p>I was going to cook him some cioppino - but that's my favorite and I didn't feel like sharing.  So, he got fried squid instead.  Hopefully he'll forgive us for the swords, arrows, maces, etc that we left in it, I mean after all, we did go on a food run for him!</p>
<Br>
<p>So now Coirnav, the Avatar of Water, is calamari and Ashen Vendetta is once again flagged for the Plane of Time.  All due to the flawless execution of our members last night to knock that squid the @#$% out and keep us moving forward.  Hope calamari doesn't give you indigestion, Quarm, because we'll be seeing you soon!</p>
<br>
<p>I have to say, this is an update I wanted to make for a long time - and it feels good to be able to.  The key to victory is of course, gnome sacrifice and memorizing "Moskau".</p>

<center><p>Last night I got home from work and logged in to see what the guild was raiding.  The message of the day read, 'Hulcror next' so I thought to myself, cool a mob we have never fought before.  I loaded my port spell up while I got undressed and headed to WoS.  When I got there I ran across the result of AV's first attempt.</p>

<br><BR>
<p>After seeing that and laughing I loaded up my nukes and reassured everyone that all would go well because I was there.  After all a Gnomes DPS can not be matched by any.  So we pulled the beast and we fought valiantly.</p>

<p>In the end, I overnuked once again and pulled agro off the main tank to sacrafice myself, allowing us to win.  I know Hulcror isn't the hardest mob out there and has been killed before, but it's a stepping stone on the path to progression.</p>

<center><p>Well, it's a New Year, and there is news with the New Year.</p>
<p>On May 29th, 2003 Ashen Vendetta marched down to Rathe Council and killed him for the first time on Innoruuk. As I write this I would have never imagined that I'd be doing another update of a first time Rathe Council kill.  After calling it quits back in June to reforming the guild just a short time ago, things are really coming together for Ashen Vendetta once again.</p>
<p>Tonight we marched back down to the council and discussed some shit with them.  Steelhammer shouted, "Listen up you twelve pieces of shit.  We are sick of you bastards and when we finished here, each and every one of you will have that large ugly stick implanted into your ass."  So the words were said and it was time for us to throw down.</p>
<p>The council came out of the corner early and got a lucky shot and knocked us down.  I seen we were in trouble so I had to think on me feet.  Quickly I offered pictures of Frostfyre in her panties up.  The troops got a second wind after hearing that and in the second attempt for this basically new guild, Ashen Vendetta has once again defeated the Rathe Council for the first time.</p>

<p>We went to visit Xegony Queen of air last week. We like the place. We have spent some “quality time” there lately. After being greeted by wave after wave of well wishers we were finally given an audience with the Queen. Irongut bent her ear for a while, then she took a nap. (He tends to have that effect on people.)

Even Gerweena still had mana after the fight…

<p>Yes, the rumors are true. Ashen Vendetta and Legends have merged, and after our first official raid we are one kill a way from being back to Time. Not bad considering our relaxed raiding schedule. It’s nice to see 72+ players in raid again. We couldn’t have asked for a better guild to join with. Congrats to our members on their new flags. Your new guildtag, is the one that says “Bad Motherfucker” on it.</p>

<p>Now for the drama, and you know how we all love drama (it’s on about the same level as a kick in the sac). Rumor has it that some disparaging people in other guilds have laughed at our progression so far, made fun of the fact that AV didn’t kill Xegony on the first try. We have nothing to hide. It took a couple of night of strategizing (a word some readers may not comprehend… it isn’t in their guilds lexicon… thus they stagnate rather than progress), working with 2 guilds wasn’t easy. After the merger….. mission accomplished.</p>

Laugh it up Chuckles, you may think that we have fallen too far behind, but those footsteps you hear are ours. </p>

<p>Xegony, Rathe Council, and Fennin Ro = owned.  So, now only one remains.  Calamari is coming soon to this webpage - followed by a dead multi-headed dragon.</p></center>

<center><p>Well, now that we're back and done causing drama, I figured I'd throw everyone a bit of an update on what we've been doing.</p>

<p>Our first order of business was to do something interesting, like get flagged for Kod`taz and kick some ass in Ikkinz.  So flag we did and with our mighty army of 36 we cleared the Chambers of Glorification on our first run.  The secret, for all those wondering, is have your main tank sing country music to the bosses, causing them to go completely insane, throwing down their loot and fleeing in all haste to escape the deadly cacophony.  So, armed with a country-music-singing dark 'elt' we ventured into the Antechambers of Destruction and knocked those chumps in there the @#$% out, and collected some nice spoils while we were at it.</p>

<p>Where are we headed?  Right now, we're looking for quality folks to kick some ass with us while we get back into Time and work on clearing Uqua.  Interested?  Check out the recruitment section on the forums.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The new message board is up and running.  Hope to see you all there!</p></center>

<center><p>After a summer of relaxation a few of us have decided to rebuild the guild that we once had.  Despite all the nay sayers who have told me it's to late for AV and to not bother, I like a good challenge and we will see where we end up.</p>

<p>With that said, I am glad to be back on Innoruuk and we're ready to start kicking some ass and taking names like we once did.  We have some old faces returning and some new blood to teach the ways of the raider.  I'm looking forward to the challenge of this new journey that is placed before me.</p>
<br><br>
<p>We will have a new message board up and running shortly.</p></center>
