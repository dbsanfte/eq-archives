<td class="table1"><hr color="#000000" noshade>
<p>In May of 2000, a few friends got together after a guild named Storm fell apart.  The original intent was to form a guild where we could just hang out, bull shit and have fun.  Ashen Vendetta was formed and what happened the next few years we never imagined.
</p>
<p>For the first two months Ashen only had a roster of around 10 people.  We were booking plane of fear and plane of hate raids and borrowing an enchanter, monk, & a cleric or two from Dawn of the Phoenix to help us out.  Some where along the line, we picked up the desire to be a top raiding guild so we decided to start piecing together a guild that could do the bigger mobs.</p>
<p>After building a core group of members we decided to put a goal date on our first "big kill".  Trakanon was still new to guilds at the time and we had decided that we were going to kill him by October 21st, 2000.  We killed Trakanon for the first time exactly on October 21st, 2000.  We weren't the first on the server to do so but it was impressive seeing how we had only been around for 5 months as a guild.</p>
<p>The guild moved forward and entered Veeshan's Peak second to Legions of Darkness.  We zoned in wanting to prove something to not only the server but to ourselves.  A month after we first entered we cleared Veeshan's Peak for Innoruuks first clearing of the zone.  No one expected us to do it.  We were determined to prove all the nay sayers wrong.</p>
<p>From the high of Veeshan we decided to storm into Velious.  We were slowly gaining ground on the competition of Legions of Darkness and The Pantheon.  The Pantheon had owned up on working their way to Sleepers while we and LoD were running into each other and forming the biggest rivalry this server will ever see.  Racing each other, training each other, and doing everything possible to one up each other, we seemed to be in each others face every day and lasted many expansions.  Ashen would have never made it to the top if it wasn't for LoD always being there to make us push harder.  For as much as I hate to admit, LoD was one of the biggest reasons that kept this guild wanting to be on top.  Who else better to knock off the top other than the guild that used to pass us off as they ran into solb and permafrost in their planar gear and just completely owned up Nagafen and Vox.</p>
<p>Towards the middle to end of Velious Ashen really started to be on even ground with LoD if not just in front of them.  On a night that I will never forget, Ashen woke the sleeper on Innoruuk.  We went down knowing that it was only a matter of time before LoD tried to wake him so we basically did it ourselves.  Rounding out Velious mobs we finished clearing the expansion with what is still one of my favorite fights.  The Avatar of War.  We worked our assess off learning how to kill him and it paid off in the end.  Yes folks, we were the first guild to bring Avatar of War loot to the Bazaar :)</p>
<p>Luclin was pure ownage for us.  We were raiding just about 7 nights a week trying to clear every named possible in Luclin.  Originally we were going to go the Acrylia route and we had the first key to inner acrylia across all servers.  Catarina worked her ass off trying to do that quest and running into bugged and broken content.  Once she got the key made she got rewarded for being the first player to complete it by having an item named after her that now drops off the boss of acrylia.  From seeing how bad that zone was though we quickly jumped into Ssra and started hammering away at keys.  Vex Thal was our goal and we were going to be first in there.  We were the 5th guild across all servers to kill Emperor Ssra and around 7th overall to clear Vex Thall.  We were on top and had space between us and LoD for the first time.</p>
<p>Planes of Power came out and we headed into it and never looked back.  We quickly cleared through most of the lower tiers and entered the elementals 3 months after it was released.  Broken content and back flagging took the wind out of our sails though.  Re-flagging people over and over because you needed 60-70 people to raid burnt a lot of our core members out.  Watch 6 months of a lead that you had over other guilds dwindle away because you were blocked on the Rather Council killed any momentum we had.  We stuck it out though and came through by killing Quarm and clearing another expansion first.</p>
<p>Gates of Discord had so many issues that the majority of Ashen called it quits.  It wasn't balanced for level 65's and running into brick walls over and over killed the game for us. From 6 man trials that were not balanced correctly to being stuck in broken zones like Uqua for two months hoping for fixes to come, our excitment to be out front and our fun in EQ pretty much ended.  We lost many members to the design of the game, some to other games and even more to real life.  It really wasn't one persons fault or even a number of people.  The truth of the matter is a bunch of circumstances most out of our control caught up to us and hit us hard.  The last few months we have been stumbling around dazed and confused much like Mike Tyson was after James Buster Douglas unleashed some massive shots onto him.</p>
<p>So after lots of discussion about where the guild is today we have decided to step back and enjoy ourselves.  We will no longer raid to be a front runner on new content.  We will no longer bang our heads off the walls trying to re-flag players and mass recruit just to stay alive.  Instead our plan is to sit back and relax some.  Have some fun with each other and if we decide to raid something it will be on our time and we will want to do it.  We're mostly tired of EQ feeling like a second and third job for us.  We want to go back to the days where the only things that mattered were the people you called friends in guild chat.  We will be helping each other out on quests, levels, AA's or just being there for each other.  Perhaps one day we will get the urge to throw ourselves back into the hardcore raiding guild scene.  Until that day comes or doesn't you will find members of this guild having fun and just enjoying life.</p>
<p>The most important thing that I have seen through the last 4+ years in Ashen is this.  Items and loot are just numbers and they're easily replaced.  Friendships are the most important thing in life and that is no different in the world of EverQuest.  Some might be surprised by this but the drive behind most of the officers that built this guild wasn't loot or items or magelo profiles.  We killed stuff to kill it together and have a hell of a time in the process.  Loot was never a driving force for us.  It was always just a bonus for doing what we loved to do.</p>
<p>I apologize for this long update.  Ashen has been a big part of my life from the time I formed it until this very day.  I have so many great memories in this guild that I will never forget and so many to look forward to.  I want to personally thank every single member that was ever a part of Ashen Vendetta for helping make the best guild one could be a part of.</p>

<p>The ebb and flow of Everquest’s life cycle has been more evident in recent times than ever before – going through the growing, or perhaps more accurately, shrinking pains has been akin to watching the England v Portugal football match (yes, it’s called football for you unschooled doubters out there).  There are high points, there are low points; then there are even greater peaks, and yet lower troughs.  A rollercoaster ride that sometimes leaves you unsure of what to feel, or at a loss as to what to do or say.
</p>
<p>As a guild who doesn’t resort to pick-up lines such as “Hey baby, there’s a raid happening at my pad, wanna join in?” (well okay, Snoog tried but he has permanent slap marks to show for that now – Kelle seems to do the trick though!), building up numbers has been a difficult and long process, but perhaps we are beginning to see a switch in fortunes.  Is that a speck of light at the end of the tunnel, or just last night’s stand shutting the door and leaving quietly after picking your pocket while we’ve been snoring happily away?
</p>
<p>Reflagging for PoTime has been taking place with the help of our friends over at Legions of Darkness, while on our own we have been doing a variety of older/interesting content:
</p>
<ul type=disc>
 <li>Ditching Packmaster with 30 people including recruits/bots;
 <li>Ditching Rondo with under 40 people including recruits/bots;
 <li>Ditching our clothes with 35 people including recruits/bots… err wait a sec.
 <li>Administering a beating across various PoP zones with… you’ve guessed it, around 30-40 people tops (including the cleanest Blazzaxx kill you’ll ever see, funny how people didn’t die unlike when you have 60 throwing themselves at a mob!)
 <li>Getting naked and filming ourselves in compromising positions, then reacting with shock and disbelief when those videos somehow get leaked out onto the Internet and are subject to mass downloads around the world, followed by a guild appearance on Saturday Night Live in an attempt to diffuse potential negative or disapproving conceptions about the guild as a whole.
</ul>
<p>I would post some pics and vids, but I’m not sure those “screenshots” would be suitable at this point in time.  Like the England game, it’s still a sensitive issue, so let’s not go there.  (Fuck it, just go to Google and search for Danaere “Cyberwhore” Passionheart, Steelhammer “Roberta” Soulforger, “Real Doll” Malinda the Sleepless, Snoogans “Asspoker” D’Mela, Lorilei “Flute” Speedyfeetz and of course Uvavu “Diggler” Eranu… ahem).
</p>
<p>To sum it up - from the highs of Uqua mini-bosses to the lows of Sol Ro, the veterans among us have experienced the veritable gamut of emotions – but while we have strength left to pick up the pieces, we will continue to do so.  Like England, we still have a strong core of dedicated officers flanked by a strong group of players, short in numbers as we are.  England have the 2006 World Cup to look forward to, but hopefully our own rejuvenation will finally come to pass a lot sooner than that.
</p>

<p><font size=2><b>If you’re interested in joining the fun and frolics, talk to Elycion, Luvmy, Kelletia or me in game or PM us on our forums.</b>  Server xfers are encouraged too!  We will be doing a mixture of Gates and PoP stuff, with considerably more emphasis on the former.  Kodtaz flags and Time access would be highly beneficial.</font>

<p>To LDoN or not to LDoN, that has been the question plaguing us since the expansion was released.  Farming elementals on nights outside of our Time rotation had reached the stage where even twinks were shunning some of the loot that came our way, allowing our good friend Rot to have many a field day.
</p>
<p>Given that some previously relatively empty zones were beginning to fill up with newly flagged people from a variety of guilds, we fought the alluring shackles of complacency and made the decision to push ahead with LDoN.  And although the patently annoying raiding restrictions imposed were enough to drive us bonkers, we attempted to make ground in the various missions offered while catering to every member's raiding needs.  This is frustrating enough for a guild of our size, with an average of 60 regulars online at any given night, so hats off to all the top end guilds who have struggled with LDoN but come through all the same.
</p>
<p>A couple of months back, we warmed up with Normal level raids to get to grips with the kind of adventure that would await us in the future.  We came through the Mistmoore, Takish and Rujarkian trials with relative ease on our first or second attempt and realised Time level raids were the ones that required the majority of our focus.
</p>
<p>It was a good wake up call really, because the brutal death limit and unpleasant dungeon inhabitants slapped us out of our Time-farming stupor and forced us to take on a steep learning curve.  With 36 people in the raid, there is small margin for error, and everyone's contribution is more or less vital to the final outcome of the adventure.  Success and failure were chasms on opposing sides of the knife edge we stepped on.  So although we racked up our losses and bore multiple scars on our backside from trips to Mistmoore and Rujarkian, progress was made with every attempt.
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-09-04/Valdoon.jpg"></img></p>

<p>Well this overgrown, pasty excuse for an undead corporal had it coming to him.  Last night, as a more youthful Bill Murray once remarked: We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-09-04/Valddead.jpg"></img></p>

<p>But wait, where is this mythical new loot that we were promised by our Wayfarer friends for dispatching this monstrous fiend?  Myth no longer dear reader!

		    <img src="./images/2-09-04/Valdbracer.jpg"></img>
</p>

<p>LDoN might not be everyone's cup of tea, but the intensity and focus required to achieve victory has undoubtedly helped us to tighten up a few areas on the raiding front - and regardless of what GoD brings, that will stand us in good stead.

<p>To celebrate the imminent release of Gates of Discord, we all felt that something a little bit special needed to be concocted, an incident worthy enough of mention in this long-overdue update.  The general consensus was that everyone would begin by making their contributions, however small, towards a fundamental change in raiding habits.  So for our latest Time run, Smushu finally put on some pants, Tameral decided that he wouldn't LD (ok I lied), Mal decided to loot some vaguely decent items for once (okay lying through my teeth now) and both X and Bal refrained from defiling each other while pulling (you must be wondering if any of this is actually true).  I myself even evaded the clutches of the Sleep Monster (omg, self buuurrrnnn!)
</p>
<p>That didn't quite seem to be enough for us though.  The ransacking of Time proceeded in the usual fashion, including some interesting stage 1 antics, the occasional exotic pull (hi entire stage 3 field), as well as the offering of random sacrificial victims during an otherwise flawless run.  I suppose the first incident that truly deserves mention was that we didn't aggro Vallon Zek while engaging his equally unappealing brother Tallon Zek, much to the surprise of all involved, which sparked some decidedly festive activity as everyone congratulated each other, patted themselves on the backs, and handed cookies all round.  Despite this veritable smorgasbord of fun and frivolity, we couldn't quite shake off the feeling that a certain something - that <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, as our esteemed French brothers would say - was missing.  Like a creeping shadow that silently haunts and extends with the waning of day's light, our discomfort grew with every passing god that lay slain at our feet.
</p>
<p>Thus did our dilemma continue right until our meeting with Quarm.  We racked our brains while our monks nuked, our wizards healed, our mages executed flawless flying kicks and our clerics tanked - but all to no avail.  In an act of desperation, we called in our berzerkers to contribute by chucking whatever random shit they could find.  As a last resort, we even camped a beastlord, hitherto totally unheard of in the entire documented history of Everquest.  During all this time, Quarm lost head after head in a flurry of frantic frenzy and then finally, right at the very death when there appeared to be absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel...

<p>The audible sigh of relief could be heard reverberating throughout the raid.  Who cares that Quarm was back at 33%, the important thing was - we could finally get a decent screenshot of his dead body!  Besides, we take everything in our stride, and are naturally unfazed by whatever comes to pass.

<p>Of course, in the heat of the moment, I forgot to take said screenshot.  All the singing, dancing and naked oil wrestling that followed had me somewhat distracted.
</p>
<p>Regardless of that minor point, what we DID end up discovering was that an uncontrollable rift in the very fabric of the space-time continuum, resulting from such a bizarre occurrence, caused parallel universes to coincide, leaving us with the following scenario:  two bubbles from alternate dimensions.  One contained Real Zeb, and the other, for lack of any other appropriate description, contained Stoner Zeb.

<p>Real Zeb did all the 'right stuff', throwing casual lines at Druzzil while not strictly keeping his gaze at eye level, but the majority of the raid was fascinated by Stoner Zeb, who simply stood there and did... nothing.  It was truly an awe-inspiring sight to behold.  Valiant adventurers gladly risked the notorious teleporting death trap referred to simply as Come20KInPoKWithMe, just to gaze longingly at this true demigod.
</p>
<p>A fine way to end a memorable journey in Time indeed.</p>

<p>In other news:  <b>LDoN sucks</b>.  Oh wait, that's not news.  In any case, the next update will hopefully show you some pretty new pictures of dead things!
</p>
<p>Mixed in with this, due in part to slackness and also because January is perennially an ass-kicking month, is a belated Happy New Year message.  Yeah I know it's over a month late, and people have already broken all their resolutions by now, but there you go.
</p>
<p>Here's to hoping that GoD will bring us some interesting content that we can enjoy for the months to come!  Until then, be sure that we will find new and innovative ways to kill our rangers, as well as continuing to invest heavily in research towards changing the innate sexual orientation predominant in Lhile, bards and shadowknights.
