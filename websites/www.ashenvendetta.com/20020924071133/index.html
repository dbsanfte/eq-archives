		<p class="detailsBold">Well its been almost a month since I last updated 
this sucker, blame it on the end of the summer, Labor Day, and the NFL gearing 
up. Actually, I was just lazy :)
<p class="detailsBold">So what's with the circa 1970's hippie title? No, I'm not 
quoting Crosby Stills and Nash; this is as good a summary of what the last few 
weeks have been for the crew. One minute you are kicking much virtual mob ass, 
the next you are turing into Corky and Webster fighting over the last of the kool 
aid. I have seen great fights, and I have seen, for lack of a better term, shit.
<p class="detailsBold">But hey, that's why we play the game, when you know one 
ill turn can cause corpse summoning. 
<p class="detailsBold">For the most part we have been fighting in Vex Thall, Ssra, 
and a few odd bosses of this zone or that. A Shei Vinitras here, Burrower there, 
etc. Highlights include trying AoW with 34 people, most of those 2 boxing at 2 
am on a weeknight. Got him to 7%. That was the most fun I've had loosing in a 
long time :)
<p class="detailsBold">So the Valleys? Wasting a perfectly good Emperor here and 
there. <a href="images/9-9/train_1.jpg" target="_blank">Training ourselves in 
VT</a>. 
<p class="detailsBold">The Peaks? Wasting a perfectly good AoW. <a href="images/9-9/train_2.jpg">Training 
ourselves in VT</a> (and living). 
<p class="detailsBold">After our slump of performing like a pick up Plane of Fear 
raid, we got back to biz. This latest patch saw us gaining mo powah from our squad 
of l33t melee clerics. Seriously, get rid of that stupid hammer and make the proc 
a buff (ala ranger self buff) so our clerics can use much better ratio weapons 
with much better stats. 
<p class="detailsBold">Duh VI. Instead of giving clerics Melee power (i do agree 
that bash was good), you should have instead raised cleric def cap, and gave clerics 
a more flexible set of new spells instead of the (mostly) shitty new heals and 
summoned hammer. You are going to give druids and shamans new heals (and I agree 
both classes could use a bump in healing. Just a bump), toss clerics some love 
too. AE raid heals? Maybe a lure root. I dunno, ask the clerics I guess.
<p class="detailsBold">Ok, enough ranting fat boy.
<p class="detailsBold">Also with this patch, VT was upgraded. Excellent,... er 
um well more like ok.
<p class="detailsBold">So what's new? Well for starters the yard trash seems to 
have less hit points (<font color="#FFFFFF">although this could just be every 
cleric swinging his new toy and no afk casters trying to super nuke for that phat 
red con exp</font>). Certain spots are no longer safe, and well, I'm sort of on 
the fence about this but its true now that you got to earn those named every trip. 
<p class="detailsBold">Oh yea, no more f'n AE blind. Guess the bazillion &quot;<font color="#FFFFFF"><em>/feedback 
Hey, AE blind sucks monkey nutz</em></font>&quot; from every VT enabled guild 
payed off. Seriously, there were times when we would get 3-5 blinders at once 
(all non mezzable kind) and you would be staring at your blank monitor for 5 minutes 
straight until they finally came and lay the smack down. No amount of skill could 
save you, if you didn't pull that many you'd get caught in the respawn. Fun, eh? 
;)
<p class="detailsBold">Well, I'm glad to say that VT is now much better overall. 
Loot that was utter crap is now quite good. Still a tough place, but Aten Ha Ra 
remains tops on reward for any mob in Luclin. From just this last clearing, look 
at what we got (<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know i missed a few</font>) :

<td>  
		<p class="detailsBold">Although I personally enjoyed the patch and server 
reset spawns, there comes a point when it starts to get old. Enter Vex Thall, 
we had to avoid this place during Innoruuk's spasms. Logging people at a point 
just when the zone is getting good (the mobs that don't suck) only to have the 
server reset can be frustrating beyond anything in EQ. Goes with the territory 
I suppose.
<p align="center" class="detailsBold"><img src="images/innoruuk.jpg" width="360" height="254"><br>
<em>&quot;We are out of coffee, oh btw Innoruuk is down again.&quot;</em>
<p class="detailsBold">The gods of stability granted the players of Innoruuk some 
time this week to get things done. 
<p class="detailsBold">Before I get into the usual slew of ss loot/dead mobs, 
I'd like to take the time to say what an outstanding job the boys and girls of 
AV have done against the Emperor the last two times. Back to back 54 person kills, 
at times pulling victory from certain defeat. It doesn't get any more intense 
than that kind of a fight. Great job :)
<p class="detailsBold">Now onto the important matters, i.e. the good stuff. 
<p class="detailsBold">Vex Thall. You've read about it many places, including 
here. About what needs changed, upgraded, etc. Even though the zone only got a 
weeks preparation from VI, the zone its extremely demanding. Rumor is that the 
zone is getting looked at, that loot will get upgraded. With just the right tweaks 
in a few areas the zone will be quite entertaining until Planes of Power is released.
<p align="center" class="detailsBold"><a href="images/pain_suffer.jpg"><img src="images/pain_suffer.jpg" width="510" height="530" border="0"></a><br>
<em>Ever wondered who Pain and Suffering was?</em>
<p class="detailsBold">In just two days AV tore through the zone and clearing 
it before some chromosome-challenged intern at Sony HQ could trip the circuit 
breaker. For the most part, each boss went down without much difficulty. Except 
for Aten, who gave us some fits there for a bit. After some adjustments, pulled 
the big lass and all was well. The only people to die were those that 10k'd from 
the fuxored flux. 
<p class="detailsBold">It felt good to add Aten Ha Ra to the Emp and Aow for mobs 
we have killed not loosing the MT. You don't need hordes of people or 10+ Wizards 
when your clerics fucking own.
<p class="detailsBold">Speaking of Clerics that own, the man the Rensak loves 
to heckle will get a reprieve this update.
<p align="center" class="detailsBold"><img src="images/wolves.jpg" width="358" height="531"><br>
Or not.
<p class="detailsBold">The Aten Ha Ra kill capped off a fast and furious clearing 
of VT, and she rewarded us with some kick ass loot.

equipped:
<p align="center" class="detailsBold"><img src="images/vince.jpg" width="430" height="566"><br>
<em>Commence thy drool.</em>
<p class="detailsBold">All and all I'd say we yet again kicked out much death 
and destruction. This guild has continued to impress, in every way.
