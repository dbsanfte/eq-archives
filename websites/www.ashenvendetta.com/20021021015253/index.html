of killing mobs in record time. Many of the mobs we faced were complete jokes, 
although Thall Va Kelun Was still fairly tough. We couldn't go past him because 
the GM's were /killing everything beyond. Thats fine, not like we can't wait a 
day.</p>
<p class="detailsBold">Here is that pic trag requested of Seru. What a total chump. 
Oh yea, he did manage to drop us a bow.</p>

<p class="detailsBold">Wow... Been a while since this slacker has graced this 
page with an update! So.. what have we been doing for the last two weeks you might 
ask? Sit tight and I'll tell you!</p>


      <p class="detailsBold">We've been upto pretty much the same stuff we do all the time.  Destroying Vex Thal, Respawning Cursed 745 times in a row, Single tanking the Emperor of Ssra... but it's all still fun and good.  But the most recent event would be a battle with Seru.</p>

      <p class="detailsBold">So yea... we killed Seru again the other night.  It was an amazing battle!  In fact, it was so exciting that Irongut felt the need to die while Inquisitor was at 3% so our clerics wouldn't fall asleep.  However, as trivial Seru might be, he atleast looks cool... and I guess that makes up for sitting around and doing nothing most of the fight.  Unfortunately, I don't have any screen shots of him... and even more unfortunate is that I can't blame it on Zmim.</p>

<p class="detailsBold">So why isn't FatGut doing the update?  Well, truth be told, he's not really fat anymore.  We sent him on a diet, and he's running laps at the YMCA at the moment, but when he gets back I'm sure he'll have something to say....

		<p class="detailsBold">Lord Seru. The elusive boss mob that we just never 
        got around too. Well, as of late we couldn't anyway. One of the mobs you 
        need to kill, to get a key, was mysteriously never up. Well, one night, 
        after yet another serious VT mob pummeling, the guy we needed was up. 
        Low and behold we went there and were not trained, or met with trolls 
        blocking any doors. </p>

        
      <p class="detailsBold">So we finish our key, and after another Aten Ha Ra 
        killing, we took it light on Sunday. Cursed and High Priest in Ssra went 
        down and we said "time for Seru". We heard alot about this mob. Well to 
        make a long story short, we went in and killed him our first shot. Hell, 
        add him to our growing list of uber mobs we single tanked. And get this, 
        <font color="#FFFFFF">Seru fought back the whole fight</font>. Check it 
        out:

	  <p> Alas, Seru was not the total beast we were expecting. Granted, he was 
        tough, but we iced him with only a few deaths from his AE or a random 
        add.</p>

        <img src="images/9-30/yttrium_sleeves.gif" width="472" height="204"> </p>
      <p align="left">Oh and some other stuff like sword and head, for quests 
        or somethin.</p>
      <p align="left">With Seru dead, AV clears expansion number 3. Well, yes 
        I know about Inner Acrylia. Its a worthless P.O.S. that we won't ever 
        go to. Ever. Risk vs. Reward there is worse than Ring of Fear in Cazic 
        Thule (and that ring sucks, trust me). And who the hell wants to clear 
        a zone full of mobs that look like Robert Downey Jr. ?</p>

      <p align="left">So what else is there to know? How about another couple 
        of weeks in Vex Thall. This place is like Candy Land. Some random pics

        and hand out so much loot ya can't get em all! </p>
      <p align="left">Beyond what we do, we have been giving the much hyped Ring Of 
        Vulak a crack here and there. Well we were doing great last time when 
        some mobs, roamers from outside not part of the ring event, aggroed and 
        came on in. Oh, mind you during the wave that when you die, a drake spawns. 
        At least we didn't walk away empty handed (got this great Screen Shot!)

		<p class="detailsBold">Well its been almost a month since I last updated 
this sucker, blame it on the end of the summer, Labor Day, and the NFL gearing 
up. Actually, I was just lazy :)
<p class="detailsBold">So what's with the circa 1970's hippie title? No, I'm not 
quoting Crosby Stills and Nash; this is as good a summary of what the last few 
weeks have been for the crew. One minute you are kicking much virtual mob ass, 
the next you are turing into Corky and Webster fighting over the last of the kool 
aid. I have seen great fights, and I have seen, for lack of a better term, shit.
<p class="detailsBold">But hey, that's why we play the game, when you know one 
ill turn can cause corpse summoning. 
<p class="detailsBold">For the most part we have been fighting in Vex Thall, Ssra, 
and a few odd bosses of this zone or that. A Shei Vinitras here, Burrower there, 
etc. Highlights include trying AoW with 34 people, most of those 2 boxing at 2 
am on a weeknight. Got him to 7%. That was the most fun I've had loosing in a 
long time :)
<p class="detailsBold">So the Valleys? Wasting a perfectly good Emperor here and 
there. <a href="images/9-9/train_1.jpg" target="_blank">Training ourselves in 
VT</a>. 
<p class="detailsBold">The Peaks? Wasting a perfectly good AoW. <a href="images/9-9/train_2.jpg">Training 
ourselves in VT</a> (and living). 
<p class="detailsBold">After our slump of performing like a pick up Plane of Fear 
raid, we got back to biz. This latest patch saw us gaining mo powah from our squad 
of l33t melee clerics. Seriously, get rid of that stupid hammer and make the proc 
a buff (ala ranger self buff) so our clerics can use much better ratio weapons 
with much better stats. 
<p class="detailsBold">Duh VI. Instead of giving clerics Melee power (i do agree 
that bash was good), you should have instead raised cleric def cap, and gave clerics 
a more flexible set of new spells instead of the (mostly) shitty new heals and 
summoned hammer. You are going to give druids and shamans new heals (and I agree 
both classes could use a bump in healing. Just a bump), toss clerics some love 
too. AE raid heals? Maybe a lure root. I dunno, ask the clerics I guess.
<p class="detailsBold">Ok, enough ranting fat boy.
<p class="detailsBold">Also with this patch, VT was upgraded. Excellent,... er 
um well more like ok.
<p class="detailsBold">So what's new? Well for starters the yard trash seems to 
have less hit points (<font color="#FFFFFF">although this could just be every 
cleric swinging his new toy and no afk casters trying to super nuke for that phat 
red con exp</font>). Certain spots are no longer safe, and well, I'm sort of on 
the fence about this but its true now that you got to earn those named every trip. 
<p class="detailsBold">Oh yea, no more f'n AE blind. Guess the bazillion &quot;<font color="#FFFFFF"><em>/feedback 
Hey, AE blind sucks monkey nutz</em></font>&quot; from every VT enabled guild 
payed off. Seriously, there were times when we would get 3-5 blinders at once 
(all non mezzable kind) and you would be staring at your blank monitor for 5 minutes 
straight until they finally came and lay the smack down. No amount of skill could 
save you, if you didn't pull that many you'd get caught in the respawn. Fun, eh? 
;)
<p class="detailsBold">Well, I'm glad to say that VT is now much better overall. 
Loot that was utter crap is now quite good. Still a tough place, but Aten Ha Ra 
remains tops on reward for any mob in Luclin. From just this last clearing, look 
at what we got (<font color="#FFFFFF">and I know i missed a few</font>) :
