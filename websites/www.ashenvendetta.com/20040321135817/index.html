<p>To LDoN or not to LDoN, that has been the question plaguing us since the expansion was released.  Farming elementals on nights outside of our Time rotation had reached the stage where even twinks were shunning some of the loot that came our way, allowing our good friend Rot to have many a field day.
</p>
<p>Given that some previously relatively empty zones were beginning to fill up with newly flagged people from a variety of guilds, we fought the alluring shackles of complacency and made the decision to push ahead with LDoN.  And although the patently annoying raiding restrictions imposed were enough to drive us bonkers, we attempted to make ground in the various missions offered while catering to every member's raiding needs.  This is frustrating enough for a guild of our size, with an average of 60 regulars online at any given night, so hats off to all the top end guilds who have struggled with LDoN but come through all the same.
</p>
<p>A couple of months back, we warmed up with Normal level raids to get to grips with the kind of adventure that would await us in the future.  We came through the Mistmoore, Takish and Rujarkian trials with relative ease on our first or second attempt and realised Time level raids were the ones that required the majority of our focus.
</p>
<p>It was a good wake up call really, because the brutal death limit and unpleasant dungeon inhabitants slapped us out of our Time-farming stupor and forced us to take on a steep learning curve.  With 36 people in the raid, there is small margin for error, and everyone's contribution is more or less vital to the final outcome of the adventure.  Success and failure were chasms on opposing sides of the knife edge we stepped on.  So although we racked up our losses and bore multiple scars on our backside from trips to Mistmoore and Rujarkian, progress was made with every attempt.

<p>Well this overgrown, pasty excuse for an undead corporal had it coming to him.  Last night, as a more youthful Bill Murray once remarked: We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-09-04/Valddead.jpg"></img></p>

<p>But wait, where is this mythical new loot that we were promised by our Wayfarer friends for dispatching this monstrous fiend?  Myth no longer dear reader!

</p>

<p>LDoN might not be everyone's cup of tea, but the intensity and focus required to achieve victory has undoubtedly helped us to tighten up a few areas on the raiding front - and regardless of what GoD brings, that will stand us in good stead.

<p>To celebrate the imminent release of Gates of Discord, we all felt that something a little bit special needed to be concocted, an incident worthy enough of mention in this long-overdue update.  The general consensus was that everyone would begin by making their contributions, however small, towards a fundamental change in raiding habits.  So for our latest Time run, Smushu finally put on some pants, Tameral decided that he wouldn't LD (ok I lied), Mal decided to loot some vaguely decent items for once (okay lying through my teeth now) and both X and Bal refrained from defiling each other while pulling (you must be wondering if any of this is actually true).  I myself even evaded the clutches of the Sleep Monster (omg, self buuurrrnnn!)
</p>
<p>That didn't quite seem to be enough for us though.  The ransacking of Time proceeded in the usual fashion, including some interesting stage 1 antics, the occasional exotic pull (hi entire stage 3 field), as well as the offering of random sacrificial victims during an otherwise flawless run.  I suppose the first incident that truly deserves mention was that we didn't aggro Vallon Zek while engaging his equally unappealing brother Tallon Zek, much to the surprise of all involved, which sparked some decidedly festive activity as everyone congratulated each other, patted themselves on the backs, and handed cookies all round.  Despite this veritable smorgasbord of fun and frivolity, we couldn't quite shake off the feeling that a certain something - that <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, as our esteemed French brothers would say - was missing.  Like a creeping shadow that silently haunts and extends with the waning of day's light, our discomfort grew with every passing god that lay slain at our feet.
</p>
<p>Thus did our dilemma continue right until our meeting with Quarm.  We racked our brains while our monks nuked, our wizards healed, our mages executed flawless flying kicks and our clerics tanked - but all to no avail.  In an act of desperation, we called in our berzerkers to contribute by chucking whatever random shit they could find.  As a last resort, we even camped a beastlord, hitherto totally unheard of in the entire documented history of Everquest.  During all this time, Quarm lost head after head in a flurry of frantic frenzy and then finally, right at the very death when there appeared to be absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel...
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/gate.gif"></img>
</p>

<p>When in doubt, blame the bards.  In this case though, after some sleuthing by various informants, there was simply no doubt:</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/buildup.gif"></img></p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/Ruvcredit.jpg"></img></p>

<p>The audible sigh of relief could be heard reverberating throughout the raid.  Who cares that Quarm was back at 33%, the important thing was - we could finally get a decent screenshot of his dead body!  Besides, we take everything in our stride, and are naturally unfazed by whatever comes to pass. 
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/response.gif"></img>
</p>

<p>Of course, in the heat of the moment, I forgot to take said screenshot.  All the singing, dancing and naked oil wrestling that followed had me somewhat distracted.
</p>
<p>Regardless of that minor point, what we DID end up discovering was that an uncontrollable rift in the very fabric of the space-time continuum, resulting from such a bizarre occurrence, caused parallel universes to coincide, leaving us with the following scenario:  two bubbles from alternate dimensions.  One contained Real Zeb, and the other, for lack of any other appropriate description, contained Stoner Zeb.
</p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/2pods.jpg"></img></p>
<p align = "center"><img src="./images/2-06-04/2zebs.jpg"></img></p>
<p>Real Zeb did all the 'right stuff', throwing casual lines at Druzzil while not strictly keeping his gaze at eye level, but the majority of the raid was fascinated by Stoner Zeb, who simply stood there and did... nothing.  It was truly an awe-inspiring sight to behold.  Valiant adventurers gladly risked the notorious teleporting death trap referred to simply as Come20KInPoKWithMe, just to gaze longingly at this true demigod.
</p>
<p>A fine way to end a memorable journey in Time indeed.</p>

<p>In other news:  <b>LDoN sucks</b>.  Oh wait, that's not news.  In any case, the next update will hopefully show you some pretty new pictures of dead things!
</p>
<p>Mixed in with this, due in part to slackness and also because January is perennially an ass-kicking month, is a belated Happy New Year message.  Yeah I know it's over a month late, and people have already broken all their resolutions by now, but there you go.
</p>
<p>Here's to hoping that GoD will bring us some interesting content that we can enjoy for the months to come!  Until then, be sure that we will find new and innovative ways to kill our rangers, as well as continuing to invest heavily in research towards changing the innate sexual orientation predominant in Lhile, bards and shadowknights.
