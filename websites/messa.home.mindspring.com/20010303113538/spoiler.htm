Tae Ew Archon<br>
Location : The Archon spawns at the top of the
&quot;temple&quot;. Turn right and you'll see a ladder on your
right and a door straight ahead. Go through the door and you'll
enter a maze. The maze is a little complicated, but suffice it to
say that if you're invis and hug the left wall, you'll eventually
find outself going up a short set of stairs into what's known as
4 Corners (4c). 4c is a large square are that has 2 lizard spawns
at every corner, and recently they've added higher level roamers
patrolling this area. Go around past two of the corners and
you'll see stairs. These stairs lead into the temple. The temple
layout is fairly simple (a square path with a set of stairs at
each level), and the Archon is at the top.<br>

Tae Ew Cenobite<br>
Location : From the beginning, go forward and turn left, just
like for the templar/diviner. Go through the same door, but take
the LEFT path when it branches, open the door and follow the
path, there will be more doors along the hallway, but continue on
past them. At the end of the hall there will be a door (I think).
Past this there is a pool of water with a little&nbsp; green blob
in the center. The Avatar spawns at the center of that blob,
along with the Cenobite (they share the same spawn point).
Swimming through the blob causes you to go into a room below the
water. If you go up the ramp from there, you enter a small
ante-chamber where it is safe to rest and pull the Avatar to.
Alternatively, you can instead do this. From the beginning, go
straight ahead and up a ladder. On your right is a pool of water
that you can swim down. Swimming down there you enter a water
filled room with gators. Surface and you will see 2 ladders
leading up to a platform. Go up and go through the door, which
will lead a room with green water with small wooden bridges
crossing on top of it. This path leads eventually to the same
ante-chamber described above. <br>

go into the maze, but instead climb the ladder to your right. Go
through the door and follow the path, turning left when it splits
which will lead you into a room with a pool you can swim down.
Swim all the way down and it will lead to a large room of water,
surface and you will only see 1 other exit from the room (known
as the &quot;gator tunnel&quot;). At the other end of this tunnel
is a green pool of water. At the far end of the pool, at the
bottom, is the spawn for the steel golem.<br>

It was a pain in the butt camp but the boots have already saved
my life more times than I can count. While she was there I timed
her every time and she seemed to drop boots about 1 time every 8
- 12 hours. Also be careful because I have seen her triple harm
touch people and they died instantly. She only did it 2 times
while I was there but she does her regular harm touch all the
time. Good luck! I've had numerous friends time this - every 20
minutes either a necro or Drezlna will spawn. More often than not
- a necro will spawn<br>

named Trazdon carries it at times, and can be found at the on the
steps with the Magicians, in that area. Aside from being a quest
item, the Circlet is a fairly decent item for Necromancers (Only)
as it offers 4 INT, 10 Health and an Armor Class of 4. The Dark
Circlet is found in the room to the right of the bc room.....(the
room with the lava pool that you can walk on and a ramp that
spawns two dark elf mages......the name of the necro is Tarzdon
(something like that) and he spawns in place of the second mage
in the room....one spawns on the first landing of ramp and the
other spawns on the second landing, so make sure you kill the
mages I spent about 6-7 hours there the other night and only got
one :-(....it is supposed to be a little more common then that I
heard though....I am lvl 31 and he conned quite green to me..I
imagine he is about 25 or so.<br>

that about 5 minutes after you kill Varsoon, Varsoon the Undying

you out if you are still in the zone.&nbsp; He was still blue to
me, but he looks like a zombie, and hits for 72.&nbsp; He really

http://everquest.gamestats.com</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Bone Chips: Talk to a paladin in the paladin's
guild and he will send you out to collect bone chips. Give him 4
bone chips (stacked will do). You will get experience, guild
faction and some money. Note that you must be given this quest to
complete it. Players with low faction will not get anything by
giving him bone chips. you will increase faction with Clerics of
Underfoot, Kazon Stormhammer and Miners Guild 249. After enough
times, he may give you another quest.<br>

</font><font size="4"><b>*Raise Faction with Corrupt Guards of
Freeport*</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">One easy way to raise faction with all the 'bad
groups' without losing faction to the good groups is to do the
inert potion quest in Erudin. <br>
<br>
In Erudin go to the top of the palace and look for an enchanter
guildmaster in the open area named Tereon (or something like
that) hail him and he'll say he is a scholor of enchantments and
will ask what it is that you study. Reply to his question with
something like, &quot;I study enchantments&quot;. He'll say
excellent, please take this inert potion to salisan in the roots
and herbs shop. (Two floors down in the palace). Take the potion
there, Salasin reveals himself as a thief and says the real
Salasin is outback. You'll gain faction with corrupt qeynos
guards, corrupt freeport guards, coalition of tradesfolk and a
few other groups. And you won't lose faction to any of the good
groups.<br>

</b><br>
</font><font size="3">Killing the halflings in nek forest does
*not* raise any neriak factions.&nbsp; The only faction it raises
is the orc faction in the commonlands. It also&nbsp; hurts
numerous faction in Rivervale, including the guards, merchants,
and&nbsp; the mayor.<br>
<br>
So far, I have only found 3 ways to raise faction with neriak.
One of those&nbsp; ways is to give lightstones to a DE NPC in
south ro, as part of the research&nbsp; quest. This raises the
guard factions for foreign quarter and commons, and&nbsp; the
merchant faction. She is part of the merchant faction in
neriak,&nbsp; though, so this probably isn't an option for good
races. Second, you can&nbsp; give red wine to the scribe in the
library in 3rd gate (this is a small part&nbsp; of the quest to
find the tome of ages and get the oracle robe BTW) this&nbsp;
raises the same factions as above (dark bargainers, dread guard
inner, dread&nbsp; guard outer) but he is also part of the
merchant faction, plus you have to&nbsp; sneak through 2 zones in
neriak to get to him.<br>
<br>
Finally, you can raise faction with the indigo brotherhood (the
neriak&nbsp; warrior guild) by killing elven slaves in crushbone.
Only the elven slaves&nbsp; give the faction, and the only
faction that will get raised the the indigo&nbsp; brotherhood,
not any of the guards or merchants. <br>
<br>
You also take a BIG hit with all of the 'good' elven factions by
killing&nbsp; them, so do so at your own risk.<br>
<br>
This exhausts my knowlegde of neriak factions, in return I would
like to&nbsp; know if anyone has found a way to raise the dead,
the spurned, or whatever&nbsp; faction the guards in 3rd gate
are...they still glower dubiously, despite&nbsp; the fact that in
commons and foreign quarter, the guards are indifferent,&nbsp;
and the merchants are warmly.<br>

</font><font size="4"><b>*Unrest*</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">How to tackle the basement in Unrest: <br>
<br>
Let's start with some assumptions: <br>
1) All spawns are 19 min 40 sec apart. <br>
2) Try to take on no more then two creatures at a time. <br>
3) You have to be able to kill hags quickly, these are by far the
deadliest mob in Unrest. <br>
4) Your party consists of at least a Warrior, Cleric, Wizard and
at least one of extra, preferably a Cleric, a Caster, or a Druid.
<br>
<br>
Attached is a bitmap that contains a map with all the spawn
points, the green dot is where the spirit in Unrest (has Dwarven
Work Boots!) spawns the green line is the line that the mobs walk
on when coming to you or retreating. <br>
<br>
The first thing you have to do get to the spirit at point 11.
Most people think that training the entire mob out and having
your party run in is the best way to do this, I have a different
way and it gives you a chance to set the time between spawns. <br>
<br>
Setting up of the basement begins once you get to point A. Try to
clear all creatures up to that point. Remember always target Hags
first followed by mortuary fungus. Once you have cleared up to
point A. have your party med up and get all healed up (you will
have 19 min to do this so take your time). <br>
<br>
Once everyone is ready attack the creature at point 5, normally a
hag, a GDB, or a Fungus. Right away run down to point 6 and
attack the creature there. Now wait 2 min at point 6 medding. At
this point you'll see 2 mobs on either side of a pool of blood,
Do not walk around the pool there are traps with fungus in them. <br>
<b><br>
</b>Attack the mobs at point 7. And again wait 2 min and have
your casters med up. Then move down to point 8 and attack the mob
there, wait at point 8 for 2 min. Move on to point 9 and kill the
mob there. Retreat to point 8 and med to full health, this will
normally take about 8 to 10 min, Now you are ready to take on the
spirit. Attack the spirit at point 10, sometimes a TT will be at
point 11, be sure to stand with your back against the wall if the
TT throws you into the pit at point 13 you WILL die. <br>
<br>
Once you have killed the spirit kill the TT but try to melee it,
you'll need this battle to last about 2 min. If your party is up
in health and mana take on the TT on the ledge in the pit, have a
caster cast a spell or have a warrior shoot an arrow. <br>
<br>
Do not try to take on the pit at this time, wait till after the
next spirit spawn. You tend to have about 2 min between battles,
have your tank run all the way back to point A pulling whatever
is there to point 11. If you can keep your battles staggered to 2
min you will get a gap of 6 to 8 min before the spirit spawn,
this is a good time to try to take the pit out. It is a good idea
to clear the pit before the spirit spawns so when the TT spawns
afterwards and you get thrown into the pit you won't get nailed
by 4 mobs. <br>
<br>
NOTES: <br>
1 ) Always keep the path clear all the way back to point A, it
will normally take you this much time to kill the spirit once he
starts retrieting. <br>
2) Always know how long you have to the spirit spawn down to the
min. <br>
3) Order to attack things: Hags, Sprirt, Fungus, TT, GDB, Barbes,
Bats, Monks. <br>
4) Sometimes a hag will spawn in place take this as an
opportunity to clear even further back to the stairs out of the
basement. <br>
5) Casters: Don't cast unless it's needed, with 2 min intervals
you will need the mana. When a hag spawns &quot;Open the can of
Woop ass.&quot; <br>
6) Clerics: Your primary responsibility is to keep the warriors
alive. <br>
7) Warriors: KILL KILL KILL. =)<br>

<p><font size="3"><b>The Azure Sleeves</b> can be found in lower
guk, it is a favorite amongsnt almost anyone due to the high AC
on this item. AC12, Wt 0.6</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The embroirdered black sleeves</b> can be
found in lower guk. This cape has an armor class of 4 and grants
+10 hit points and +25 mana. It is useful for mage types.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The mana stone</b> is dropped off the evil
eye in Lower Guk. It is on the mino side, if you don't know what
the mino side is then there is no wayyou can get this item
anyways. Well, once on the mino side, you goacross the bridge and
into the tunnel, follow it down hugging the rightwall, you will
come to a big intersection with a way to go right that ismore
than a 90 degree turn to the right, more like 135 degree turn
tothe right, its kind of hard to miss if you don't know pay
attention.Anyways, follow it down and you will come to the cage
room. This room ispretty hard and you can try using invis to get
by it but it usuallydoesn't work. Usually one to two wan knights
and an urd shaman is whatyou get in this room. Right after the
room take a right and down thathall on the right, before a bridge
is the evil eye. He either drops a sewn evil eye bag (reduces
weight of anything in it by 70%), this is thenon rare spawn or
the mana stone(right click it to trade hps for mana,not sure how
much though, don't have it yet), this is the rare spawn onhim.
There ya go, hope this helps. Its really not too far in and if
youcan get past the cage room its not too bad.Full group of lvl
40's could do it easy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ok, this starts in the Dead side of the Lower
Guk at the Tower Entrance. On your left you'll see 3 tal wizards,
the one in the middle will occasionally spawn as &quot;a ghoul
ritualist&quot; This guy drops a <b>Black Embroidered Cape </b>(worn
on shoulders), 4 ac, plus 15 mana, plus 20 hp, and black
embroidered sleeves as the rare drop, which have the same stats.
Go into the tower, pass the first ladder and make a left, you'll
see another ladder there, in a room with 3 froggies. 2 named
frogs spawn in there, first one is the ghoul assasin, common drop
<b>Guise of the Deceiver</b>, 4 ac, plus 13 charisma, plus 7
magic resist mask which has Illusion: Dark Elf. Only bards and
rogues can wear the mask but anyone can use the effect from your
inventory. His rare drop is a <b>Serrated Bone Dirk</b>, 8
damage, 26 delay piercing weapon which procs encompassing
darkness, rogue only. The other named from in this room is the
ghoul supplier. His common drop is a <b>Light Burlap Sack</b>, an
8 item holding backpack which reduces weight by 70%, and his rare
drop is one sweet as hell belt, <b>the Thick Banded Belt</b>. 8
ac, plus 15 str, weight 0.5, ALL/ALL. Walk down the stairs to teh
right of the ladder, clear the frogs, and you'll come to a room
with 5 frogs in it. In one of these spots spawns the a ghoul
savant. He drops the <b>black enameled mace </b>as the common
drop, 8 damage 28 delay mace, and <b>black enameled chestplate </b>as
his rare drop, an AC25 black plate chest, good stuff.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Go down the stairs, you get to the third floor.
head straight right and you'll enter a room with 4 jail cells and
a platform in teh middle. On top of the platform spawns the ghoul
executioner, his booby drop is an <b>executioners hood</b>, 5 ac,
plus 4 str plus 9 dex leather hat, very nice for rogue. His rare
drop is of course, the <b>executioners axe</b>, 25 damage, 50
delay, effect: Haste warrior only 2h slashing weapon. Also to the
right of the staircase you'll find a room with a book case in it.
In there spawn the ghoul sage and ghoul scribe. The sage drops a
belt, forget the name right now, that has 2 ac, plus 4 int, plus
8hp, and a rare drop hate (forget the name), that gives 4 wis, 9
int. The scribe's common drop is a <b>Parchment of Flayed skin</b>,
most likely some quest item, and I don't know waht his rare drop
is is. To the left of the stairs you'll find a room with 3 frogs
and a bed in it, in there spawns the ghoul cavalier. his common
drop are <b>adamantite epolets</b>, 9 ac plus 7 wis plate based
shoulders, and his rare drop is the <b>Dark Reaver</b>, a 20
damage 42 delay SK only slashing weapon, which procs steal
strength.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Also to the left of the staircase you'll find
another room with 3 frogs that leads to the lobby, which you can
also get to by dropping off the bridge where the 3 tals are. From
the lobby, follow the path the hall and you'll get to a jail room
with 4 cages, and 3 halls. If you go straight, you'll have to
clear out about 10 frogs ranging from wans to dars and their mage
equivalents, if you're good you can do these in pulls of 2. keep
heading in and you'll get to a long room wiht a trap in the
centre, the trap just drops you down a bit, you can make your way
back up NP. on either side of the trap there is a room. the left
room has a pillar of water in it, swim up that and you'll find
the reanimated hand, with 1 dar guard. The common drop off the
hand are <b>serpentine bracers</b>, 1 ac, plus 3 dex, plus 9 agi,
plate looking, awesome bracers. the rare drop sucks, <b>adamantite
band</b>, plus 75hp, minus 10 magic resist. The right room will
lead to a ladder, not sure whats down there, and will loop back
around into a little bedroom where the Ghoul Arch Magi spawns.
His common drop are <b>silver silk leggings</b>, not sure on
exact stats, but they have 4 ac and I believe some plus int. His
rare drop is either a <b>Robe of the Archmage </b>or a <b>Shiny
Metallic Robe</b>, don't have stats as I haven't seen this item
myself, apparently it's great though. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Keep heading straight, you'll run into maybe 10
more frogs, and you'll get to teh ghoul lord. don't even attempt
this without a full group of level 45+, or 2 full groups of
levels 40+, this bugger is NASTY. Doubles for 125, Harm Touches
for close to 500, and has over 8000 hitpoint. He's also has 2
guards in his room, either dar knights, bok knights (level 43 to
46) or jin wizards (43 to 46). Fighting all 3 of these combined
is basically suicide unless you have a killer high group, so
you'll need to pull 1 of these solo. I'm not going to get into
the intricasies of Aggro Radius pulling, but if you have a
skilled puller he should be able to figure it out. The ghoul
lord's common drop is a <b>skull shaped barbute</b>, a 13 ac,
plus 35 hp, plus 10 magic resist plate helm, and his rare drop is
the <b>shortsword of the Ykesha</b>, 8 damage, 24 delay 1h
slasher which procs ykesha, a 70 damage DD spell. This extends my
knowledge of Lower Guk, if you take the left path of the prison
type room you get to some froglok slave camp, havn't really
explored it, and if you take the right path you get to a serious
maze like area with 40+ frogs crawling all over the place. this
way leads to the ghoul sentinel <b>(drops brigandine tunic) </b>and
the frenzied ghoul, which drops the <b>flowing black silk sash</b>.
from what I've gathered this path is harder than the path to the
ghoul lord, so you don't have a hoep unless you're around the
level </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Executioners hood</b>: It's found off the
ghoul executioner on the 3rd floor of the tower in Lower Guk The
method we got there was from first going to the dead side, near
the tower, and going through the door guarded by 3 basalt
gargoyles. Go down there and you'll find 3 live frogs, normally
around level 36-38. Kill those things, and continue going, and
you'll fall down a trap into a little pit. There is 1 mino inside
this pit, and the Minotaur Elder will occasionally spawn there.
He is in the upper 30s, nothing too difficult. His common drop,
is a <b>Chrysoberyl Talisman</b>, a 5 ac, plus 3 wis, plus 8hp
neck piece. We haven't got his rare drop yet, if anyone knows it
let me know, otherwise I'll post it when I find out.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Climb up the ladder out of the pit, kill about
4 greater minotaurs, and move on. There are only 2 directions to
move in, one of which loops back around to the trap floor. Go the
one remaining direction, and take the first left you can. You'll
go down an extremely long hallway, there are a few wandering
minotaurs and live frogs in there, but nothing to worry about. At
the end of this hall you'll get to a pool of water with some
planks, and overlooking the water you'll se an evil eye. He seems
to be about a 1 in 4 spawn thus far, a shaman usually spawns in
his place. The Evil Eye is a pretty quick kill, not many HP at
all, but he can charm so it may not be a good idea to try with a
small group. The common drop on the eye is a <b>Bag of Sewn Evil
Eye</b>, which is an 8 sack container which reduces the weight of
all items inside by 70%. The rare drop is a <b>ManaStone</b>,
which converts HP into Mana. Not sure what teh ratio is, haven't
picked one up ourselves yet. Make a right from this pool and keep
following the hallway. You'll get to the Live Tower of Lower Guk.
There are a lot of upper level 30s booting around here. The tower
is pretty small compared to the undead one. On the first floor of
the tower (down the ladder) you'll find the froglok Yun priest.
We only got to kill this guy once, and he dropped an AWESOME
item: <b>Silver-Plated Leggings</b>. These plate legs have 10 ac,
and give plus 3 str and plus 5 agility, excellent item. go down
to the bottom floor ot the tower, kill a few high 30s frogs, and
you will be at the froglok crusader. The crusader comes with 2
other frogs, ranging up to level 43. The crusader himself is in
the low 40s range, and he is a paladin so he can LoH himself. The
booby drop on the crusader is a <b>Runed Falchion</b>, a great 1h
slashing weapon. 11 damage, 34 delay, witha weight of only 2.5.
This item can be used by any class that can use 1h slashing, as
well as druids. We didnt get the rare drop off the crusader, but
I believe it is a <b>Runed Mithril Tunic</b>, dont have the stats
off hand but I believe its posted on EQLizer. The only other
thing we found of interest on the live side was the froglok
noble, we only killed him once and he dropped a white gold
necklace. no ac, plus 5 charisma, plus 7 magic fire and cold
resist. Pretty shitty item.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Nah, <b>the Runed Mithril 2handed sword</b>, 21
damage, 40 delay, casts Haste, is the Rare drop off the Froglok
King in lower guk. The King is harder than the ghoul lord, he's
about level 48 himself, he has two level 45 guards, and he is
EXTREMELY difficult. Lets put it this way, unless you have 6
level 45+ players then don't even bother attempting. Even then I
wouldn't recommend it with 1 group unless you are A) Guk Gurus
and B) an EXTREMELY well balanced party. If you really want a
shot at this Item, I would recommend you get about 12 people
together, the vast majority would be 45+, and no one should be
less than 40. </font></p>

crown of the froglok king most of the time). very tough spawn,
tougher than ghoul lord cause the inital pull could be 3 to 5

drop is a <strong>Flaming Sceptre</strong> don't have the stats

room there. take a left and go through second small cubby room
and over ledge into the pit (don't worry its more like a step
down) This area is known as the Pit. Go through the hall (2 doors
here) and past iron gate. After Iron gate you can go left or
right. If you go left and continue straight this will lead you to
the Bar Room (whole nother set of loot items here) go through
right door and continue straight down hall going through doors as
you go...you will CONTINUE STRAIGHT through the false wall. once
through the false wall your next fight is the kings room. follow
that secret passage straight, it will turn left go straight again
and you will come to a door. throught that door there is a door
on your left and a door straight ahead. the door on your left is
the Kings Room. You want to rush the room and fight inside (3
random mobs) so you don't pull the stuff from the door straight
ahead (the room there we refer to as the Ho Room....its got a few
beds hehe) The King is a rare spawn so don't be frustrated.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Since I never did a sense heading in the entire
dungeon, I will refer to all directions as when you are facing
the pit heading towards the &nbsp; porticulus from the enterance.
In the back left corner of the dungeon well on the Soulesk goblin
side, there is a left right passage that has&nbsp; in order from
right to left a Jail area, an office with 4 steps down&nbsp; to a
bedroom, an invisible wall leading to a rack and stocks. Off the
office is the room that spawns the Goblin High Priest. (maybe
Soluesk&nbsp; High Priest) his common drop is the Glowing Stone
Band AC2 Serpent&nbsp; Sight Ring. His rare drop I was told but
didn't verify is a Platinum Totem that Priests can hold for
increased mana and hit points.&nbsp; My question is, assuming the
above information is correct and the room&nbsp; right off the
High Priest is the Torture chamber, how does one make the&nbsp;
Goblin Torturer (Common drop Azure Eyepatch, unknown rare drop)
spawn?&nbsp; I spoke to many people who have lived in the dungeon
for years and they&nbsp; had never heard of him. If anyone knows
I'd appreciate it. &nbsp; Finally, here's a list of the rare
spawns I know about in A, I think&nbsp; it's complete but if
anyone can name any I missed I'd appreciate it. I know the
torturer spawns between the king and the high shaman (not
the&nbsp; high priest, as a lot of people would believe). But
since Sol A is quite complicated to describe, I have a suggestion
to make... I could&nbsp; make a newbie char on Solusek Ro and
could show you the way, as long as you can get me there alive. :)
I'd really rather describe it but as you&nbsp; know, Sol A is
pretty much made of passage after passage, hehe. Though&nbsp; if
you know where the jail area is, then know that this is where the
goblin torturer spawns -- in the room with a torture bed at the
end of the hall. Let me know if you are interested and we can set
up a meeting somewhere near there. That's the 'torture chamber' I
had spoken of I believe, it's through a hidden door near the high
priest, down a ramp, has a stocks and some odd slanting walls?
I've gone through there many times and never saw a spawn in the

(4/18, +20hp, piercing weapon) as a common drop and the molten
cloak&nbsp; (+4int/wis/ac) as a rare drop. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">I didn't know about the captain an knew of the
other but never bothered to kill her since a L48 wizard was
always camping the spot whenever we looked. &gt; You also forgot
Kindle (a named fire imp, drops obsidian ring and &nbsp; impskin
gloves), the goblin bartender (drops drakescale leggings and
something else) and the goblin drunkard who drops frothy goblin
tonic&nbsp; (and possibly something else??) which gives the Aura
of Marr effect&nbsp; (never tried it so I don't know what aura of
marr does, hehe). Kindle = 'another drake I can't recall the name
of'... I &nbsp; haven't yet seen the rare on the drunkard and
given how rarely he spawns and the fact that we're just about
done with the dungeon (Hence me asking if we've missed anything)
It isn't likely that I will.<br>

size="3"><br>
<br>
The harvester in solB (infrequent spawn) carries a <strong>pack</strong>
that I believe has 10 slots (maybe 8) and reduces weight of
everything by 80 - 100%. <strong>Staff of Writhing</strong> - Its
the common drop off the kobold noble in Solusek B No, the staff
of writhing is the common drop off the Kobold Noble doggie in
SolB. He spawns in a room to the right and around the corner
(past the lava pool) from the main corridor zone entrance. There
is an &quot;assistant&quot; (generally a Solusek Kobold, or SK)
that spawns in the room also not far behind when the noble
spawns. Also, just outside the room another doggie, generally an
SK or shaman (caster) also spawns close to the time these others
spawn. This doggie is called the &quot;exit&quot; spawn because
he blocks the exit path to get back to the zone corridor. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">All i can tell you is that the <strong>fire
sceptre</strong> comes off a goblin in Solusek eye. The goblins
in the zone are all around level 30, but you better have a full
group of 30+ if you plan on surviving at all. There is a room
near where the sceptre goblin spawns, that has 2 soulsek
mages(level 30) and 1 soulsek priest (level 28,29). These 3 gobs
went on to take out our party of a 32 Cleric, 32 Wizard, 30
Paladin, 30 Warrior 32 Paladin 35 Paladin. The zone is sooooo
untouched, (on my &nbsp; server at least) that anything that runs
creates a train. To get to the area i am talking about, go past
the axe illusion into the mail hall. Drop down onto the ledge
where there is a door. Go through (2 fire gobs here) and open the
next door. (2 cinder gobs/fire gobs here, it differs). The spawn
is quick, so quickly take a right, and then you will be in a
hall. Follow this hall up a ramp to another door. (to the right
and left of this hall are doors that lead to quick spawn rooms
that are good for exp.) Turn left after you open the door and you
will come to a chamber with the goblin king or gob wizard. The
other door in the room leades to a wide open chamber, one of the
doors here leads to your staff. Hope you dont die as much as we
did.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The green silk drape</b> is found on the
noxious spider in SolB. And there are great items deep down in
SolB which the different fire giants drop....mithril armor and
awesome warrior only sword (<b>Sword of Skarlon </b>off the
Warlord Skarlon, who also drops the <b>mithril greaves</b>).
There is also an awesome <strong>druid only tunic</strong> which
the stone spider drops....12 AC and like +9 to agility, stam and
dex I believe. We got one of our druids one of them today. Is
rare spawn tho, the spidie that is. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The Brown Chittin Protector</b> (12ac +9agi

in SolB. You will need a full party of level 45+ to get to this
item, however <b>Polished Mithril Torque</b>. AC7 Necklace,
wearable by Melee types only. Pal/SK included. Grants 13 Wis and
13 INT also, with a weight of 4.0 This is a NO DROP item. This is
found on King Tranix. A Fire Giant, located deep within SOL B.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For those of you who don't know, the (one and
only?) portal is located in The Feerrott in a cave concealed by
an hidden wall. Basically, coming from the mountains of rathe
zone, follow the mountain range to the right and hug it until you
stumble in a secret cave. Beware the spectres and the level 40
necromancer guarding the portal. The cave is populated with a
number of Spectres (40+ lvl aprox?). Once you pass inside the
invis wall, stay to the right and you will go to other cave with
wandering skeles, Necro NPC (Cindreela sp?) and her pet.The gate
used to be one way, with another gate somewhere inside fear
plane, so you'd best be going in a full group or more of near
50's. The zone has reportedly been retuned after last patch so
its not supposed to be so difficult. (&quot;Difficult&quot;-such
a relative term. hehe) While running through Everfrost peaks,
going to get my spells for a later level, i ran across three
NPC's. One did not respond, one would only nod, and the third
gave me a quest for Tarten's Wheel. You get a book that tells you
about a wheel that is used to travel the planes. From what i
remember, you have to gather 10 wheel spokes, from all over the
world. From what i can remember, one is from OOT. another from
Kedge, and from perma, etc etc. Then you take them back to the
npc, and he will give you the container to combine them in. The 3
NPC's are close to the ruined temple where shaman buy there
disease line of spells at. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Vin Moltor in the Qeynos sewers, for the paw of
opolla [container], you should know that apparently he doesn't
give the paw every time. the question of how to get the paw.
Everyone knows how to get the container but the locations of the
rings have finally all been found by some brave druids. The four
rings come from Gynok Moltor in Befallen and High Priestess Mitty
on Kerra Isle. Mitty has the copper, silver, and gold rings
(mostly it is copper but don't get discouraged), and Gynok has
the platinum rings. Mitty spawns every 18 min and Gynok spawns
every 6-10 hrs. &nbsp; The Silver ring can also be found at the
bottom of the lake in BlackBurrow. The end result of putting all
4 rings into the paw and hitting combine is quite nice, 9ac, +9
wis/agi, +5 mana, -5 cha, -5 sv disease. I give all the credit
for this to the people who solved the puzzle on the druid's grove
message board, but I just thought I would mention the solution
here.<br>

<p><font size="3">Talk to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim warrior's guild.
To find him, go in the door and take a right past the guy that
makes scarab armor (forget name) and take another right up the
stairs and he's there. He'll ask you to kill a metal rat
(separate quest. I dunno if you need to do this) Go to the
mineshaft by the bank... A clockwork cleaner will spawn there
(pretty often) kill it and take it's remains to Beno. He'll give
you a card for another quest that I haven't done, but I've heard
it's not worth it. He'll mention an important stormguard
matter... Ask him what that is and he'll give you a note to take
to the Jail Clerk in High Keep jail.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On your way to Highpass, make a stop in Misty
Thicket and talk to Bronin (when I found him he was in one of the
towers by the wall... From Rivervale, go to the wall and turn
left before crossing to the other side and it was the second
tower I think... All the way at the top up the ladder... I've
also been told he spawns in Rivervale too. not sure on that)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ask Bronin about the emerald shard and he tells
you to kill the assassin who is after him and he'll give it to
you... This will spawn a froglok (around level 20) named Slaythe,
who will be running around pretty close to the orc camp. Kill him
and return his leg to Bronin and he'll give you a key to take to
the banker in High Keep.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now you can go to High Keep and turn in the
note for a container (the emerald - 2 slots), and the key for one
shard.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Faldor's spawn location (and where you'll find
him most often--when you find him) is in the back of Crow's in
Qeynos. In the rear of the bar, there is a door just behind the
halfling (his name escapes me right now). Faldor is usually found
behind there (there is a secret passage through the wall with the
painting in this little room that leads to the rogue guild as
well as the necromancer guild and aquaducts). He does take a
stroll out of town and up the road if he's left unaccosted long
enough. There is also a beggar who spawns in Faldor's place from
time to time, and he takes that walk up the path to the zone to
Qeynos Hills also, promptly disappearing when he gets to the end
of the road).<br>
------------------------------<br>
</font><font size="4"><b>*SoulFire*</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">1. Get the note from Kalatrina in the Hall of
Truth, top level.<br>
2. Go to the spy, tell him 'Truth is good', and then give him the
letter.<br>
3. After the Guard kills him, take his note and you are supposed
to give it to her, but she doesn't hand it back to you, so skip
this part of the quest. She noramlly tells you to go to the
Office of the People and speak with the woman there, but I'm
telling you right now.<br>
4. At the Office of the People, you are again supposed to give
her the note, but she also doesn't give it back. Simply tell her
&quot;Who is Zimel?', and she will tell you about Groflah, and
that Zimel's Blades in condemned.<br>
5. First, go to the Hall of Truth, and tell Kalatrina that
'Zimels Baldes is condemned.'. I believe this is where you first
hear about Soulfire (or is it the time you give it to her the
first time, I haven't done this part in a while).<br>
6. Now, go to Groflah's Forge, and ask him 'Who is Zimel?'. He
will give you a negative response, and then give him the Zimel's
Blades note. He will tell you to meet him in the Seafarer's
Roost. <br>
7. Go to the Seafarer's Roost (at the docks in East Freeport),
and wait for Groflah to show up. He is usually there at 3 am, but
it's fairly ramdom. When he shows, again ask him 'Who is Zimel?',
and he'll tell you about he's buddies with old Zimel. Now give
him the note, and he'll decode it for you. It says 'H E L P C A P
T I V E', on it, implying that the prisoner under the arena is
Zimel (as we suspected for some time).<br>
8. While waiting at the Seafarer's Roost, do NOT go AFK, as you
will miss a crucial part of the quest. Randomly a drunk named
Tykar Renlin will show up, and will cuss out Captain Lucan when a
bard sings a song about him. He also says that Lucan imprisoned
him and his buddy, old Zimel. Ask him 'Who is Zimel?' and he will
ask you for a drink. Give him 4 Drom's Champagnes, and he will
give you a blanket called 'Bunker Cell #2' (I think, but it's not
important what it's called). <br>
9. Go to the prisoner under the Arena. Hail him, and ask him 'Who
is Zimel?'. He will 'Stare deeply into your eyes', and say
nothing. Ask him 'Where is Soulfire?', and he'll ramble something
along the lines of 'Bog n Goo!! Freezing!! Hungry!! Thirsty
too!!'. This implies that he needs two items.<br>
10. Go kill some snakes and get a few Snake Scales off them. Put
them in a brew barrel with a bottle, and a flask of water. This
will give you 'Bog Juice', one of the items that Zimel asks for
(Bog n Goo; this is the Bog, now for the Goo...)<br>
11. Get some Fire Beetle Eyes (if you don't know where to get
these, you don't deserve Soulfire), and Rat ears, and put them
into an oven. You get 'Edible Goo', which Zimel also asks for
(This is the Goo part...)<br>
12. Give the 'Bunker Cell #2', the 'Bog Juice', and the 'Edible
Goo' to Zimel. He gives you a key called H.K. 102, and he mutters
something about Tunaria's Corridor. If you've done the Princess
Quest in High Keep, you know what to do... <br>
13. Take the Key to High Keep (located in Highpass Hold; this is
the narrow pass between Qeynos and Freeport, and the coninent
used to be called Tunaria, hence, Tunaria's Corridor). Give the
key to the Clerk in the bank, that's it. You get a note from
Hayle Mool, addressed to Zimel. It tells you to come get him in
Qeynos, but if you've been there before, you know he's&nbsp;
being held in Splitpaw... <br>
14. In Splitpaw, find him (don't ask...) and give him the note.
He will tell you something I forgot already, but then you ask him
'What is the Proof of Nobility?'. He will tell you that he
requires the note you gave him, The Brilliant Sword of Faith, the
Glowing Sword Hilt, and the Testimony of Truth (some of which are
sub-quests, explained below). <br>
15. At this point, I HAVE NOT given him the items, at least in
the correct manner (long story, and rather embarassing; I'd
perfer if you didn't ask...). If you give the items one at a
time, I have heard (though this is not confirmed) he will hand
you over the Soulfire! Congrats, you should have the blade if
you're smarter than I am!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">THE TEST OF TRUTH</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is also started in the Hall of Truth, and
may not be started after level 8. This is a very simple quest, so
I will not explain it here...</font></p>

<p><font size="3">THE BRILLIANT SWORD OF FAITH</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1. Speak with the Paladin Guild Master at the
top of the Hall of Truth, and ask him everything pertaining to
killing Lucan D'lere. <br>
2. Once you have gotten the quest, assemble a team of TONS of
level 45 plus people, because Captain Lucan is the badass leader
of the Warrior Guild in Freeport, and the head of the Freeport
Militia. He's level 48, so make sure you've got PLENTY of time to
spend killing him, since he's TOUGH. Tonight on my server (Rodcet
Nife) a group of about 20 level 40+ people LOST to this bugger,
and only killed him after dying three or four times each. <br>
3. If you get his Testimony from him (which rarely spawns, God
knows why...), return it to the man who gave you the quest, and
he forks over the Brilliant Sword of Faith.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">GLOWING SWORD HILT</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is gained off a Shadow Knight in Mistmoore
named Xicotl. I am not sure, but I think it spawns every time,
and he's in either the Guest House or the Throne Room, if I
recall correctly. He's surrounded by other Shadow Knights and
Necros, so be prepared for another tough battle (though not as
tough as the bloodbath when you fight Lucan, that's just BRUTAL).
I should point out that whenever this guy gets pulled, the whole
zone clears, so be warned...</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 1 : Kalatrina Plossen is one of the
greatest Paladins in the Land. Her duty is to train new, young
knights and keep an eye on the Hated Freeport Militia. She can be
found at the Hall of Truth in North Freeport. She is directly
above the entrance on the second floor. When you Hail her, she
informs you she has need of young knights. After further
investigation, you learn of a spy within the Militia. He is in
danger and Kalatrina hands you a note to give to him. He can be
found in the Freeport Militia House. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 2 : The beginnings of your Quest! Rush
over to the Militia House. The spy is in the middle of the
Militia House in the Courtyard on the first floor. You give him
the code and he warns you of danger. You hand him the note.
Suddenly, Militia swarm to the spy and begin attacking him! He
hands you an old piece of burned parchment and yells to return to
the Hall of Truth. He falls to the Evil Guards. Run to the Hall
of Truth! Upon further inspection of the note you read: Zimel's
Blades with some prices. Give the note to Kalatrina.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 3 : Kalatrina is excited by the note
you have been given. DO NOT give Kalatrina Plossen the Note. If
you do, restart the Quest and get it again. This is where the
Quest is counter-intuitive. If you give her the Note, she tells
you Zimel was a great Blacksmith who knew the secret of
enchanting blades and making superior weapons. She tells you to
go and talk to Rashinda Elore at the Office of the People.
Rashinda is difficult to get any information out of but once you
do, you determine that Groflah Steadirt of Groflah's Forge, was a
friend of Zimel's and may have more information. When you ask
Rashinda of Zimel's Blades, Lakeen Boorheez wanders in, saying he
is lost. He quickly exits and heads to the tunnels. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 4 : Run over to Groflah's Forge and ask
him about Zimel. He is on the second floor of the Forge and is
not very helpful. He is nervous when you ask him of Zimel and
tells you he will not speak here. Hand Groflah the Note you
received from the Spy. Groflah tells you many things and asks you
to meet him at the Seafarer's Roost. He can study the Note and
try to decode the information. Groflah hands you the Note back.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 5 : Wandering over to the Seafarer's
Roost, buy a drink, relax and watch Freeport go about its
business. Groflah SHOULD show up between 1am and 3am. When he
arrives, ask who Zimel is. He will go into a long story about how
Zimel has disappeared and the Blade, Soulfire has been lost. Hand
Groflah the Note and he attempt to decipher it. Groflah tells you
that he thinks Sir Lucan D'Lere, Head of the Freeport Militia,
and Pietro Zarn, Head of the ShadowKnight Guild in Freeport are
in cahoots and searching for Soulfire as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 6 : Thanking him for his knowledge,
look about the Seafarer's Roost. Who is wandering around? A
beggar named Tykar Renlin should be close by. Asking Tykar for
information about Zimel, Tykar responds by saying he is thirsty.
Purchase a Drom's Champagne from the Bartender and give one to
Tykar. Repeat this three more times. Tykar informs you that Zimel
has been thrown into Prison by the Militia near the Arena.
Feeling guilty, Tykar hands you a blanket to give to Zimel if you
should meet him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 7 : Alas! It is true! Zimel is locked
in a cell and has been driven crazy. After asking Zimel various
Questions, he responds by saying he wants some items. After
deciphering his unintelligible speech, you determine he wants Bog
Juice, Edible Goo and a Blanket. Well, Tykar gave you the
Blanket. You have seen Edible Goo in the various Bakeries and
know it is the most basic of delicacies. Bog Juice, wait! You
know a Brewer who has the recipe and seem to recall even drinking
some before! Hand each of these items to Zimel. Zimel will give
you a key simply marked H.K.102</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 8 : H.K.102? 'tis a Chest key. Ah! In
Highhold Pass, Humans have built a bank there to guard their
riches from the barbaric Orcs and Gnolls. Visit the bank in
Highhold Pass and hand the Bank Clerk the key. She thanks you for
the key and hands you a Note to deliver to Brother Hayle. Alas,
she is certain he is being held captive in a cell in Splitpaw, a
Gnoll stronghold.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 9 : Journeying into Splitpaw, you find
Brother Hayle and hand him the Note. Brother Hayle hands you the
Note once again and asks you to retrieve a number of items for
him. He would like you to prove your nobility to him. He asks you
to bring the Hilt of Soulfire back to him. The Hilt is being held
by an Evil ShadowKnight named Xicotl in MistMoore Castle! As
well, bring him the Brilliant Sword of Faith(Quest info here).
Finally, he asks you to bring your Testimony(Quest info here).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Chapter 10 : You have destroyed and defeated
many Evil Creatures that wander Norrath. You have lived up to
your name and go back to Brother Hayle, truly bringing proof of

greatest blade in the land! Soulfire!</font></p>

some info on finishing the quest for the staff. from the entrance
from lesser faydark you follow the path and as soon as the path
branches...you are going to take the left branch.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Immediately on your left you will see the wall

keep following it until you come to the 2 huts there. The gnome

you need to ask her about evil eyes. She doesn't like many ppl so
you may have her respond to you something about your breath... I
have a hef and she didn't like me. I got a lvl 1 gnome to hail
her and she gave him the staff just fine. so make sure you ask
her first. That is the end of the staff quest. I hope this helps

to save his peoples Princess (Princess Lenya) from Carson McCabe
who has taken her prisoner. If you accept he gives you a bracer
and tells you to give it to the Princess and then return to him
with BOTH the Princess and the bracer. There are two Princess' in
highpass keep. One is Princess Lenya, who I believe is the true
one. She is an entachantress and can be found behind one of the
false walls on the top floor of the keep. The other is Princess
Lenia who is in the prison. I have reason to believe she is a
dark elf like Carson McCabe and is there to trap unsuspecting
questers. I was unable to contact her as the prisoners chased me
around spanking me while the guards looked on in amusement. Upon
giving the bracer to princess Lenya (on top floor) you get BAD
factions with Carson McCabe and company. The princess thanks you
for proving yourself as a helper to the high elves, allthough she
is quite snotty about it. She also thanks you for unlocking the
door. What door? She then returns the bracer to you. I took the
bracer back to the high elf at the gate and gave it back to him,
getting bad faction with carson but good with high elves. He then
gave me a medallion to give to Princess Lenya that he said he
found on a beggar. I tried giving this medallion to Princess
Lenya, and the beggar in the courtyard, but neither of them say
anything more than &quot;thanks&quot;. Oh well... time to find
out about that door.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There are two doors behind false walls on the
top floor, and neither open when clicked. Both of them do not ask
you for a key either. They simply dont' open. One of these doors
connects to the area in which Princess Lenya is so I took that to
be the door to open. After exploring the rest of the floor I
found a room near the back of the top floor where an NPC named
Mistress Anna is standing. Although she threatenes you with
punishment for distrubring her, claiming that she is a good
friend of Carson Mccabe when you ask her about Princess Lenya she
says &quot;did the Lady send you or were you Sent By Someone
Else&quot;. If you say the Lady sent you she tells you to jump
off the balcony. IF you say you were &quot;Sent By Someone
Else&quot; she tells you that Princess Lenya is held behind a
locked door and thus cannot escape. In order to get the key you
must go to the Golden Rooster at night and Kill a locksmith named
Marlin who will spawn in Room 6 on the top floor. I believe it is
this conversation with Mistress Anna that triggers Marlins spawn,
however it may be the conversatoin with all three NPC's named so
far. At any rate, I went off to kill Marlin (I am a 19 Magician)
and brought along a (20 wizard) for good luck ; ) Instructing the
wizard only to help me when called for I attacked Marlin who
conned blue to me. He was a total bastard to fight, completely at
all times ignoring my pet, and focusing on me. He hits about 2 or
3 times consecutively for somewhere in the range of 36 damage and
neve rmisses, and never hits lower than that. My wizard friend
had to join in to assist in killing him and even then we only
just managed it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Upon his death the corpse instantaneously
dissapeared. We received bad faction with all of highpass
including Carson McCabe. We did not recieve any xp. Extremely
annoyed, but assuming it was a bug, we repeated the incident the
next night. I approached Marlin first though, and right clicked
him. He is apparently coded as a vendor as the buy/sell window
came up, even though he was not selling anything. I have been
told that vendors are coded such that they will not drop
anything, nor will you get xp for killing them. I haven't
verified this though.&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, we killed him
again, this time grouped, and same thing happened. Frustrated I
tried one last time, but this time I spoke with him at length.
Finally after asking him about Princess Lenya he told me that he
feels sorry for her and if I were to bring him a silk evening
tunic (from qeynos) he would give me the key.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">So after legging it to Qeynos and then gating
back I presented him with his damn silk evening tunic. He tahnked
me, gave me a key, and I receieved GOOD faction with Carson
McCabe! This leads me to believe that he is also in league with
Carson and another part of a trap to snare questers (just like
Princes Lenia).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I ran back to the two locked hidden doors and
tried them both with the key but it didn't work on either door.
No message saying &quot;this door is locked and you are not
holding the key&quot; pops up. At this point I screamed all sorts
of obscenities at the nearest passing guard and then /petitioned.
The GM's assured me all was well even after I described whole
event. Then they said they'd check and get back to me. (yeah
right...).<br>

<p><font size="3">You MUST have a very high standing with the
gnomes of the Gemchopper hall, especially Manik Compolten. Go to
the Mines of Malfunction enter through the doors and go straight
keep going until you hit a room that has a corridor to the left.
Go through the corridor and you will come into a room with 4
doors (including the one you cam in from) go right you should
pass by a room that as 3 spellcasting trainers. You will end up
in the room where red V spawns. Kill him to get the box. You will
also need 4 fragments to combine within the box. To get the
fragments you need to kill obsolete clockworks (the fragmets can
be found on the gnome clockworks and the spider clockworks within
the mines) Once you get 4 of them combine them in the box you got
from Red V . This Will give you a blackbox. Give the blackbox to
Manik Compolten in the Gemchoppers Hall and e will give you some
cash faction and an item. Most of the items I ave gotten were
rusty weapons patchwork armor , a lore item named Iony's Absorber
(seems to be broken) and every once in a while a Bull Smasher.
Good luck to all who try this I have gotten 2 smashers so far and
it took me about 3 days each to get them.<br>

<p><font size="3">Well, I've tracked down the source of the staff
segment quest, the one that involves killing the bandit in east
karana and taking the key to highpass and getting the second
segment. Go to lumi in the clerics guild in Erudin and ask him
&quot;What important missions?&quot; then &quot;I will track down
the staff&quot; &nbsp; Evidently the staff was stolen as a gift
to Carson McCabe in highpass, you can also talk to Brallos Hoost
in Kithicor, he was one of the people who stole it. I'd like to
provide stats of the staff, but unfortunately, my faction isn't
high enough to get the container from Lumi. =(&nbsp; The sad part
is that I'm an enchanter, and even with Erudin illusion and

guildmaster of either the Prexus deity or one of the other water
ones (You need to be a Erudin Paladin of this deity to do this, I
think) and he'll give you a bag w/ a combine button. You fill
this bag with 1 diseased shark skin (LORE) and 3 Baby shark skins
(No Drop/Trade)... Where these guys all spawn is straight from
the stairs at the Eruidin docks, hug the wall to your left and
follow it around a bit. Either a diseased shark will be there or
a normal shark, which I blieve is tougher and more common of a
spawn. The babies are easy... level 1 I think... They are all
around the shark spawn. After you get 3 baby skins and 1 Shark
Skin (Yes, not diseased... It says &quot;Shark Skin&quot; and is
Lore). Put them all in the bag so it is full, not so the 3 baby
skins are stacked. After you're done with that and pushed the
combine button, go back to the same guildmaster dude and hail
him, go through the BS and give him the bag... You get a Barnacle
breast&nbsp; plate (8 AC +3 Heat and Cold SV, I think... Has the
look of luish/green&nbsp; plate and Rangers can wear) <br>

&quot;What is the power of the gatecallers&quot;. The correct
answer is, &quot;The power of the gatecallers is summoning&quot;.
The guildmaster will then ask you for two summoned daggers and
two summoned food items. Give him those items and you will
recieve a pair of gatecaller gloves. The gloves are neat for the
fact that they are black platemail gauntlets that spell casters
can wear. They change your characters graphic. The downside is
they are ac3 weight 5.5 (very heavy) and they are a nodrop,
notrade lore item.<br>
------------------------------<br>
</font><font size="4"><b>*Ring of the Dead*</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">So young followers of The Dead, you seek the
Ring of The Dead. I Cynister Grimshadow shall tell you the Lore
of the Ring. The quest for the Ring of The Dead began very early
in my life. When I&nbsp; was but a young Shadow Knight of the
second circle I did take upon myself&nbsp; the spell components
quest given out by a powerful necromancer who resides&nbsp; in
the top of the Lodge of The Dead. &quot;Fill this box with 10
fire beetle&nbsp; eyes and return it to me!!&quot; This I did and
my standing with The Dead was&nbsp; increased. A second quest he
gave me when I returned his box of beetle&nbsp; eyes. &quot;Go to
the Isle of Kerra and bring me four eyes of the Kerra Isle&nbsp;
beetle!! In addition there roam in the Southern Plains of Karana
giant &nbsp; beasts called elephants. Bring me the tusk of one of
these mighty beasts!!&quot; &nbsp; Being a young Knight I knew
that this quest was beyond my reach for quite &nbsp; some time,
but I never forgot his words. Instead I grew in strength
and&nbsp; when I was an Initiate of the eight circle I chanced to
speak with Loveal&nbsp; S'Nez a Shadow Knight master who kept a
room below the Necromancer who gave&nbsp; me my first quest.
&quot;Greetings young one! So you seek to be a servant of&nbsp;
The Dead? Perhaps you could aid me in my assigned duties.&quot;
When I dared&nbsp; ask him &quot;What are your assigned
duties?&quot; he told me of Sir Lindeel, a&nbsp; rather
troublesome Paladin of The Temple of Marre, who was disrupting
the&nbsp; trade routes to Neriak in the Lavastorm Mountains.
&quot;Kill this meddler!&nbsp; Bring me his testimony as proof of
his death if you wish to prove yourself&nbsp; a loyal servant of
The Dead.&quot; With fire in my eyes I did rush forth from the
city and to the entrance&nbsp; of Lavastorm, calling upon our
Father to aid me. Entering the mountains I&nbsp; immediately
turned my steps toward the ancient stronghold of the
Teir'dal,&nbsp; Najena, for we still did trade with the denizens
of that cursed place and&nbsp; sent our priests there to learn of
the necromatic arts. As Najena came&nbsp; into view I did behold
the Paladin standing upon the hill next to the &nbsp; broken
doors of Najena. I was not a moment to soon as a group of
Fire&nbsp; Drakes were descending upon the Paladin. I drew back
on my bow and sent an&nbsp; arrow into his thigh. Screaming to
his weak god he did rush upon me&nbsp; leaving the fire drakes to
seek other prey. We came together and I knew&nbsp; that this
would be my first true test as a Shadow Knight for his
strength&nbsp; was equal or perhaps greater than mine. Screaming
my battle cries I&nbsp; pressed in, my magical combined blade
cleaving thru his chain armor. He&nbsp; retreated and I knew he
would seek to heal himself with his god's energy. &nbsp; Leaping
forward I discharged the power of my hate from the palm of my
hand &nbsp; before he could summon his energies. His blackened
body fell at my feet&nbsp; and I searched his pouch and pulled
forth his testimony, I was victorious!!&nbsp; <br>
<br>
As I slowly made my way back to Neriak I gave thanks to my Father
for&nbsp; aiding me this day. Upon my arrival I proceeded
directly to S'Nez and&nbsp; delivered the testimony. &quot;Well
done young one! You are indeed a loyal&nbsp; servant of The
Dead!&quot; Again my standing with the dead was increased and
I&nbsp; was gifted a spell for my efforts that I might use when I
reached the ninth&nbsp; circle. &quot;Perhaps you might aid me
with another matter?&quot; said Loveal to me.&nbsp; Of course I
agreed and he told me of the Thex Mallet and to seek
Kizdean&nbsp; Gix in the West Commonlands and speak to him the
following words... &quot;Utalk&nbsp; Adarev Otcin&quot; and he
would know me as a servant of The Dead. I did bide my time for
many moons as I knew that the Commonlands were &nbsp; fraught
with dangers and a dead Shadow Knight could not serve his
masters. &nbsp; Instead I trained and fought and learned of the
arcane arts until I was an &nbsp; initiate of the 12th circle.
Then one dark night I did venture forth into&nbsp; the vastness
of the commonlands to seek out Gix. Find him I did and I&nbsp;
spoke the words to him. &quot;You speak the words of The Dead!!
Take this&nbsp; letter to my apprentice Llrodd in the ancient
dungeon of Befallen and&nbsp; Windstream will come. He has a
piece of that which you seek.&quot; As these&nbsp; words fell
upon my ears I was taken with anger... longer still must I
wait,&nbsp; for Windstream was a legend told to frighten the
young elves in their beds in Neriak. Commander Windstream, leader
of the Befallen garrison in ages&nbsp; past a cruel elf even by
Teir'dal standards. Could it be that he lived on &nbsp; in some
limbo as an undead creature? Surely I was not strong enough
to&nbsp; brave such a foe, much less venture into the terror that
is Befallen.&nbsp; Surely Innoruuk was testing my patience,
making sure I was worthy to&nbsp; retreive the lost Thex Mallet.
&nbsp; I followed the will of Innoruuk and ventured far in the
world, growing &nbsp; stronger with every passing day. Many many
moons passed and I was taken to &nbsp; the Lodge of The Dead and
given the secrets of the 22nd circle. With the &nbsp; powerful
spells and abilities at my command, well armed and armored, I was
&nbsp; ready to venture into Befallen. Gathering a strong group
of adventurers &nbsp; around me I did venture into that dark
place. Many times we were repulsed&nbsp; and sent fleeing from
the horrors that inhabited it's halls yet we were not deterred. I
knew that Llrodd, now an undead skeleton, waited by a well on the
first level of Befallen. I also knew that Commander Windstream
was known to appear in a secret room on the lowest level of
Befallen. In our time there I had gained 2 pieces of the fabled
Mallet from the remains of Elf Skeletons who inhabited the entry
room of the 3rd level, Windsteam must hold the 3rd piece, a
container needed to combine the other 2 pieces into <br>
the Thex Mallet. I positioned my group just inside the secret
room next to Windstream's Throne. I took myself to the well on
the first level and waited for Llrodd <br>
to appear as I knew he must. My wait was short. I gave the note
to Llrodd and he screamed at me to seek Windsteam, hurry!!
hurry!! 1 2 3!! My group shouted to me that Windsteam had
appeared and I was needed on the 3rd lvl. Knowing I could not
make it to them swiftly enough by the normal route I&nbsp; cast
invisible to undead on myself and leapt down the well straight to
the 3rd lvl. I was damaged by the fall but regained my feet and
sprinted straight ahead to where my group was engaged in furious
battle with Windstream. Joining the fray I struck and struck
again at the nightmare before me till the zombie warrior was
hacked to pieces. In a pouch on his remains was the 3rd piece of
the Mallet. Quickly we fled Befallen to the sand dunes of the
West Commons. My hands were trembling and I put the 2 pieces of
the Mallet into the magical container and closed the lid. Magical
energies flared inside the box and as the light faded away I
opened the smoking container to behold the Thex Mallet, fully
reformed. I gave all of the treasures we had gained in the
dungeon to my group, keeping only the Mallet for myself. Rushing
back to Neriak I made my way to Loveal S'Nez and bowing low,
presented him with the Thex Mallet. His joy that day knew no
bounds and my standing with the dead soared to new heights and I
was favored of the Queen of Neriak, The Lady Chistanos. For my
unswerving loyalty to The Dead, S'Nez did gift me with The Ring
of The Dead, a magical band that would bind my soul to any point
I chose. A powerful item for a Shadow Knight indeed. I hasted
downstairs to Xantis Ixtax and presented her the ring and 10
pieces of gold whereby she charged the Ring for me. It has served
me well and whenever I am in Neriak I have it recharged that I
might use it again. Thus ends my tale of the Lore of The Ring.<br>
<br>
On a real-life note I had to complete the Thex Mallet quest 4
times before I got the ring and you can only get the note from
Gix while you are under 20th level, so I ended up paying necros
and SK's who were over 10th level to get the note each time I did
the quest after the first time. =) So do the fire beetle eye
quest, do the paladin quest or you dont get the thex quest, then
do the thex quest over and over till you get the ring. Necros
dont worry bout this quest since a Bind Affinity ring does you no
good. This is a prize for SK's. I hope you all enjoyed my little
fantasy twist on the quest directions and good luck getting the
Ring. I had a lot of fun doing this one since it stretches out
for so long.<br>

There may be a few who&nbsp; don't know yet, so here goes.&nbsp;
A person can conceiveable get a dwarven ringmail tunic&nbsp; ac
12 +8 sv&nbsp; vs magic fire and cold for just 4 gold.&nbsp; Yep,
thats right, 4 gold.&nbsp; Talk to Moodoro Finharn (Crow's
Tavern, Qeynos) and give him 4 gold, sometimes he will give you a
knight card.&nbsp; Save up the knight cards and take them to a
dwarf on the siterhood isle in ocean of tears.&nbsp; Look for a
dwarf mechant in a small tent, give him the knight card and you
can get several nice items, including dwarven chainmail, black
iron boots and different bits of chainmail armor.&nbsp; You can
also get rusty weapons to, its a luck of the draw...<br>

</font><font size="3">Go to Crows in Qeynos and talk to Modooro,
for 2 gp, he will sell you the Book, go to HHP and kill the named
smuggler (dressed like a guard) and he has a page.&nbsp; If you
go to Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear he tells you
that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named Moodoro some time
ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform
of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass,
because he could &quot;feel it&quot;. He also says that Moodoro
also had page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into
highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or
pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a
hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is
Dyllin Starsine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a
sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in
Freeport).&nbsp; Beware that any smugglers around him will come
to his aid.&nbsp; Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt
Qeynos Guard, +Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen
Hands, -BloodSabers) Go back to Qeynos and talk to Modooro again,
he will offer to play cards with you for 4 gp a shot.&nbsp; Play
with him till you get the Jester card, give it back to him and he
gives you the last page.&nbsp; Combine them in the book and you
have the Testament.&nbsp; (I think, can't remember now, but I
think that he gives you the first page needed when you first talk
to him as well.)&nbsp; It is no drop.<br>
