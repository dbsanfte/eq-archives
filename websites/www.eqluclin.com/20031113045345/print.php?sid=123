<font class="print-normal">     Mystic Dawn has made a comeback of late. We have gone from being almost extinct to having three very active groups of some of the best players I have ever known. Our guild is doubling in size almost by the month. I am not talking about a level 8 noob in Gfay either nor am I talking people in their thirties even. We are almost exclusively 50+ and have been building towards the high game at a very nice pace. Our guild foundation has been relaid of some nice and highly proficent players, we need more of such players however to reach our lofty goals.<br>

    MD is not content to sit in the shadows hitting up old world mobs with our new ability's bestowed on us by the planes. We intend to do some raiding in the old world, but as we gain the power to we will put it too the most possible use progressing though the planes. No one will leave MD for the reason of us not doing enough!<br>
<br>
     Now this is where you come in my friends, we are recruiting with caution on a case by case basis. One thing is certain we want to be much bigger but while we are expanding quality will not be comprimised. Our normal group and impress the pickup's works quite well for recruiting, but I wouldn't mind taking people in if they want to approach us through our message board which is accessible through this site: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/emo/mysticdawn/">Mystic Dawn</a> <br>
<br>
     Mystic Dawn is all about making sure you have fun in this game. When the LFG flag goes up that means our guild has messed up. We keep our members busy grouping, killing, and raiding. If a guild can't keep people active and doing things then in my humble opinion it does not deserve to exist and that goes for MD as well. There are way to many guilded people on this server with an LFG flag up. I understand sometimes the guild just has a bad night, but I can only recall my guild to be the only one I have ever seen with more then 4 players in a group of the same guild outside of a raid.  <br>
<br>
     There it is Luclin, come and say hi. If you are looking for a guild give us a try. If you are in one of the afformentioned guilds that does not keep you busy remember, this game is here for you to have fun. If someone in my guild is not having fun then I would encorage them to do what makes them happy. Does your guild do that for you? All that MD asks out of its players is to have a good time, be fairly active (2 days a week at least required), and listen to us when we give advice on the mechanics of your playing (let us help you become the best you can be =)  <br>
