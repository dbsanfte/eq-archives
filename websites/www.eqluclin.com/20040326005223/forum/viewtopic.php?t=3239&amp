Most likely it won't matter, especially with religous based terrorism everywhere.  There is no threat you can level against someone who willingly straps themself with 50kilos of explosive and blows themselves up or someone who believes a group of people has no right to life because they exist.
<br />
There will always be people who will use violent or extreme methods to attain their goals and to destroy that which everyone has worked so hard to achieve.  One thing that can change is the tolerance or silent acceptance of such acts by governments and people of the world.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Bush out of office would have 2 consequences I can see...
<br />

<br />
1) We WOULD be less likely to up and invade someone.
<br />
2) I think we would get more cooperation on the international front, because there won't be the perception that Bush will up and invade someone.<span class="gensmall"></span>

The problem with this, though, is that most terrorists do not have a home country per se.  As it has been mentioned, there is no country Al Queda, no country that is Taliban.  Sure, they may hang out in Afghanistan, Lbya, Syria, Iraq, etc but they truely may not have a country of their own.
<br />

<br />
I do think, however, that if somebody such as Dean is elected president we could see an increase in attacks.  The Middle East seems to have learned something of a lesson in not to play with Republican presidents.  For instance, Carter had that nightmare of a hostage situation, Reagen came to office and *bam* the hostages were released.  George H. Bush kinda but the halt on Iraq in '90-'91, and obviously you can see what the current president is doing in Iraq now.
<br />

<br />
I think that leaders of various countries (e.g. Qaddafi) may think to themselves that with Bush in office they really would rather not be tied to any terrorist attacks against the US.  Syria, Libya, and Iran sure as hell do not want to be invaded by the US and to ensure their safety I would wager they would tell The Local Terrorist 414 do not carry out any attacks against the US at this time.
<br />

<br />
Again, if Dean would get elected and pull US troops out of the middle east, then hey it would be a great opportunity for terrorists to take advantage of the situation.
<br />

<br />
That sums up my point, I suppose:  being able to take advantage of the situation.  When you have hundreds of thousands  of American troops at your door step, you don't want to do anything to @#%$ them off.  However, if they hightail it home and the Commander in Chief will not deploy them again, then it would be advantageous at that point in time to carry out any attacks.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Carter's problem was that he had no precedent for such an event like 60 American citizens being taken hostage over seas and lack of a definitive plan to follow.  The man looked like he had finished crying when he made the announcement about the embassy in Tehran, that combined with the economy / gas crisis cost him the election in 80.  I don't know if Reagan can be truly credited with the release of the hostages, he hadn't even been in a day when they were released.  Then of course later he gave us the Contra scandal that flew in the face of his foreign policy.
<br />

<br />
The largest factor that kept terrorism out of American soil was and still is for the most part, distance.  Getting from Saudi Arabia or Syria to the United States is not an easy endeavor.  Once that distance is taken away the probability for attacks becomes greater, ie Iraq.  Terrorists simply cross a border or two rather than an ocean.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Very few Islamic terrorist organizations are getting governmental support. And the Saudis (our alleged allies in the region) are the only ones spending big bucks supporting terrorist organizations. <span style="font-style: italic">Crusader</span> is a very emotionally charged word in the Arab world. A US president that comes across as a crusader will automatically be feared and opposed by Arabs. Feared in the way that everything such a person does will be considered suspect, like everything a rabid dog licks. A lot stronger distrust than merely BushLied(tm). And not a fear that you could pretend is <span style="font-style: italic">a good thing</span>. Maybe the Arabs have some tinfoil hat and black helicopter grade distrust, but just as unconvincible by any evidence. I predict that invading anyother Islamic country in the near future will provoke a permanent and irrevocable war with Islam. The kind you can only end with nuking everyone from Morocco to Indonesia, killing billions, to avoid losing. Whether there is a good excuse or not won't disuade the tinfoil turban crowd.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Is Islamic terrorism going to get better, worse or stay the same?</span>If bush and binladen have succeeded in making/defining the <span style="font-style: italic">war against terror</span> to be the <span style="font-style: italic">war against islam</span>, then it will never ever get better until either the USA or Islam has been utterly destroyed. Palestinian terrorism against Israel is the model to understand here: it will end when the Palestinians or Israelis are all dead. The rebels in Iraq are trying to transform from the remnants of Hussein's regime (and their sympathisers) into guerillas trying to expell foreign invaders. It does not help that some of the folks on the "ruling council" have engaged in terrorist acts themselves. It also does not help that the council gives the appearance of religious favoritism. Historically, that transformation sometimes works, and when it does not, the group ends up becoming bandits (an example of a failed transformation would be the IRA, they currently rob banks, extort money from businesses, import and sell drugs to support their activities). An example of a successful transformation was the Taliban in Afghanistan.
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Is Domestic terrorism going to get better, worse or stay the same?</span>
<br />
Domestic terrorism is the big blind spot of folks in the USA. Domestic terrorist groups that manufacture Sarin and Cyanide bombs get ignored by the media. If it had been found in Iraq, instead of Texas and Washington, everyone would agree that invading Iraq was justified, instead gets ignored since no one seems to want to talk about Domestic terrorism. <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/terror/tyler-terror.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">sample</a>. I am not sure if Puerto Rican separatists are still committing terrorist acts (like shooting people in congress).  
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Did/does the invasion of Iraq motivate or deter Islamic terrorists?</span> The jury is still out on this one. I would like to believe that it does and will. 
<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Will the presence or absence of bush make a difference in Islamic terrorism?</span>
<br />
Both Islamic and Christian fundamentalists consider the USA to be the great satan. I doubt the presence or absence of bush will mean didly squat to the Islamic terrorists.

Domestic terrorists are and will be encouraged by an administration that supports many similar values of the terrorists. Domestic terrorists get support from the media such as </span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Ann Coulter wrote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"><a href="http://www.observer.com/pages/story.asp?ID=6258" target="_blank" class="postlink">Source</a>. Interesting. What she is saying is that she approves of McVeigh's actions, and only disagrees in the choice of target. What she is saying is that murdering Americans is acceptable. Pure hypocracy. But what do you expect from someone who wants to establish death camps for liberals (read Treason for the references). This is the sort of thing that is both supporting the bush administration and getting support from the bush administration. Putting a stop to domestic terrorism will need to start with their media wing: limbaugh, coulter, fox news, cbn, savage and oreilly. What about leftist terrorists? They have been marginalized for years and lack their own TV network. Think about how different the dial on your tv would be if they had their own TV and radio networks like the right wing terrorists do? The PETA network? The earth first tv network? nation of islam tv network? There is no kkk tv network, but if you chat with a klansman, they all love savage, limbaugh and oreilly.

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">What motivates Domestic terrorists?</span>Death to: jews, blacks, @#%$, hispanics, doctors, the US government, judges, the UN, police, cutting down trees, animal testing, liberals and the media. Depends upon the particular terrorist group. 
<br />

<br />
When analysing a "terrorist" act in the US, one needs to look at the target. If the target is a representation of US power, projected onto the US, then the act was done by Domestic terrorists (for example, OKC and the anthrax letters). If the target is a representation of US power projected onto the rest of the world, then the act was not done by Domestic Terrorists (example 9/11).

				<td colspan="2" align="left"><div class="postbody">Actually Carter did have precedent and Americans had been taken hostage prior to Iran and held captive.  I will be the first to say that Jimmy Carter is a good and decent man.  He has deep moral and religious convictions that lead him to think that violence is never the answer.  That didn't make him bad, but it did make him ineffective in dealing with that situation.  He hamstrung the size and composition of the military rescue operation against his military advisors wishes.  Other good men died because of this lack of support.
<br />

<br />
Reagan openly stated on the campaign trail that the hostage situation would end one way or another with him assuming office.  He made no bones about the fact that his solution (having seen all diplomatic efforts fail already) was massive and focused military power.   Reagan gets elected, the terrorists are rushing around feeding them and trying to make them ready to get home before the bombs fall.  The Libyans are proven to sponsor terrorists, np Reagan sends in the F-111's to show them that we feel thats not a good decision.  Now around every 5 years, good ol Qadaffi comes out and shakes his fist on TV, says America is bad, and hauls balls back to his bunkers.
<br />

<br />
I am not saying America, or its Presidents are always right.  We can and do make some bad decisions.  As human beings though, any decision to show force to people who can only understand force is usually a good decision.
<br />

<br />
Typically the bullies in the world have the same mentality as school yard bullies.  Did the school yard bullies stop because they got in trouble?  No, it took someone kicking their butt to straighten them out.
<br />

<br />
When you look at the "terrorist states" in the world (i.e. those willing to use terrorism as an internal and/or external political tool), you see the same mentality.  Its sort of a "we know you won't do anything about it, so this is the level we will conduct relations with you" attitude.  
<br />

<br />
Having never lived in a terrorist state, I do not have first hand information on life their.  However, I do have second hand info.  My neighbors when I was a teen had escaped the persecutions of the Ayatollah (sp?).  They were nice, quiet, God (in this case Allah) fearing people; who lead simple lives.  They worked their butts off and there was always a stream of new relatives showing up to help out and get set up before moving on.  To be honest, at first I was suspicious as hell of them.  However one day I got a paniced phone call from them to come over right away.  It turns out our 40lb dog had managed to get through the fence and was "staring at them" through their living room window.  The entire family was standing or huddled on top of the tallest pieces of furniture and the women were all crying.  I found it kind of bizarre, but took the dog home and figured out how the dog got through.  I went over later to appologize that our harmless, friendly dog had come over and scared them.  This is when I got a shock, these people were terrified of all dogs.  It seems the Ayatollah had "death squads" with man eating dogs that would literally tear people apart in the streets or their homes for imagined infractions.
<br />

<br />
Over the years, I found this family to be some of the best American citizens I have ever met.  They celebrated American holidays with a fervor while still maintaing their distinct Arab culture.  They worked hard and were in support of violence as the first solution against terrorists.  These people scrimped and saved, bought businesses and used their profits to bribe Iranian oifficials to allow more of their friends and relatives to imigrate to America.
<br />

<br />
You want to know what a free and loving paradise Iraq was before the invasion?  Check Amnesty International's web site.  It lists them among the worst in human rights violations.  I believe the number of missing in official custody had topped 100K since Saddam took power there.  I firmly believe that man has reservations in the very lowest levels of Hell.  My wish is that if found guilty by trial, he is turned over to the people who survived his tortures for a long and messy execution.  Heck, I'd buy them some slow burning wood if they want to burn him at the stake.
<br />

<br />
Might does not make right.  However sometimes it is the only tool to use against people who believe it does.  Those who believe Bush is some crazed, blood thirsty president have a differing viewpoint from mine.  I believe he is a good and honest man who agonized over the fact he was sending American men and boys to battle.  He knew some would die, but understood that it was for the greater good of a larger number of people.  He made the right decision, and I stand behind him and his job as the US President.
<br />

<br />
As president he has been working on combating terrorist organizations and states since the day he assumed office.
<br />

<br />
Bush will most certainly have my vote in the coming election.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Bush has proven that he is the right man to be leading our country and its naive to think the world will ever be a totally safe place, but he has made the world a safer place for sure.

You can thank GATT, WTO and NAFTA for that.<span class="gensmall"></span>

While this is true, it would also screw over everyone else.  Simply put at this point the world can not ignore the US nor can the US ignore the world in an economic sense.  We of course both need each other, the economy of 2003 in America is built on global trade, can't imagine the rest of the world cutting us off at this point.  I suppose this could happen (countries leveling sanctions or embargoes against us) if a real power emerged to take our place or was a viable alternative, which some think the EU could possibly do, but this is total speculation at this point.<span class="gensmall"></span>

1 - The oil embargo in the early 1970s.

2 - And the longshoreman strike on the west coast recently.

3 - Perhaps you are forgetting the banana wars with the EU (they have a legal standard for what species of banana can be sold in europe, and the banana sold in the US is not one of the approved species). 
<br />
4 - Perhaps you are also forgetting the issue with genetically modified (GM) foods, many people refuse to eat them, and many countries are starting to ban anything from entering that contains ANY GM food products. Those people remember that their governments claimed that mad-cow-disease could not be spread by food, which has been shown to be the only way it spreads. As a result, they don't trust the claims that GM food is safe. The US government is claiming it is safe (and most of it probably is safe), and threatening a trade war if the others don't roll over and surrender. 
<br />

<br />
It has happened in the past, and it can happen again in the future. Failure to remember history can be a very very expensive mistake. International trade is getting more and more interconnected and brittle. It would be easy for a small pissing match over some little thing to blow up and stop the wheels that keep you fed and clothed. Or for some small link in the chain to decide to say "no." Having a bunch of guns won't do you any good when I burn my crops to keep you from getting my property. What? You don't think that can happen? Then you never learned history. And you don't know people.

<br />
The Clinton way of dealing with the situation, (what was Clintons way of dealing with it?) clearly did not work.  After the first World Trade Center bombing, there were other terrorist attacks on the US as well, most notably was the ramming of the USS Cole.
<br />

<br />
I mention these two attacks because I know there is a tendency of some to want to belive that because a republican is President, the world hates the US and if we had a Democrat in office, this would somehow change.  
<br />

<br />
That being said, what I like about the Bush plan is we have provided a target closer to where the terrorists live. (Iran and Afganistan).  This is a very appealing target.  The easy choice is for the terrorists to attack us there, which means they are not attacking us in the US.  When they do attack us overseas, we are better able to flush them out.  There is also the added benefit of putting the terrorists in a reactionary mode, that is they are now reacting to things we have done rather then us reacting to them.  This gives us more control.

Unrealistic.  The US props up so many developing countries that if the world at large would suddenly conspire to stop trading with us, a good 80% of it would go into the crapper long before we would.  In fact, we would probably outlast everyone.  We can make enough food in the US to feed ourselves.  We have extensive oil reservers and the possibility of turning Alaska into swiss cheese and sucking it dry, plus offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.  Of course, gas prices, along with many other staples, would shoot through the roof...but it would be nowhere near as bad here as in many of the countries we cut off.  
<br />

<br />
Additionally, our emprical, capitalistic nature has led us to having extensive ownership of property and industry in many countries abroad...so while the country might stop trading it's state gained products with us, we would still have our own companies in those countries to help out...and woe be to the country who tried to start some stuff with US civilians overseas (unless Dean wins, then it'll be safe to do whatever you want to US citizens).
<br />

<br />
And, in the worst case scenario...we can probably take what we need from the rest of the world if it comes down to it.  There is no military threat to the US on this side of the globe.  No single country in the world could take us on head-to-head short of a nuclear strike.  The entire world combined does not have the amphibious assets to stage an attack on the US homeland...not to mention the fact that just about every Joe Civilian in US has a gun...and some of us have lots of guns.
<br />

<br />
Back to the original topic though.  I think that in the short term we will probably see an increase in terrorist activity for another 18-24 months.  However, terrorist leadership is suffering BIG TIME right now (though the media doesn't want you to know that...it's not exciting if we're winning).  Did you maybe see those "High Value Target" playing cards that were released when we went into Iraq?  Well, we've captured or killed about 75% of them...including #'s 1 2 and 3 on the list.  
<br />

<br />
We'll get Osama sooner or later.  Catching Saddam goes to show that it doesn't matter where you hide.  Hole in the ground or cave in the mountains, sooner or later someone is going to sell your %@$# out for 25 million bones.  
<br />

<br />
Most terrorists are uneducated and ill-equipped to do much damage short of blowing themselves up without leadership.  Like an angry mob, all it does is stand around and yell a lot unless a charismatic leader comes along and gives it direction.  Then it becomes a dangerous weapon.  Killing terrorist leadership will not stop the occasional wanker from strapping on a bomb and running into a crowded restaraunt in Isreal, but it will stop them from crashing planes into buildings.  
<br />

<br />
For example, I see lots of interviews with pissed off Iraqi's saying that they're ready to take up Jihad against the US forces.  That's fine, it's easy to talk a good game, but when it comes down to it, when terrorist go head to head with coalition forces...they lose.  And they lose HUGE.  
<br />

<br />
The crippling of terrorist leadership will begin to show in the near future.  It won't ever stop it completly, but (even though the media would say otherwise) most of these cats are not going to pick up a gun or RPG and point it at our forces...because most of them don't want to die.<span class="gensmall"></span>

They were not intending to be a military attack (in the sense of doing real damage). They were done to "feel good." Dieing in a suicide attack is a sign of <span style="font-style: italic">a good heart</span> to the primary audience of those actions: their compatriots. Pearl Harbor was an attack on military assets, and did significant damage to our military capacity (if the carriers had been there, it would have destroyed something like 95% of the Pacific US fleet, leaving Japan with uncontested military power in the Pacific for several months, by which time the US could not dislodge them). Knocking down the WTC was destroying a <span style="text-decoration: underline">symbol</span> of US economic power. It did very little actual damage to our economy. It did not destroy Wall Street, it did not destroy US trade with the world. Palestinian suicide bombing continues because it is <span style="font-style: italic">theater</span>, not because it is militarily or economically useful. Those who die get to show their <span style="font-style: italic">good heart</span> to those they leave behind.
<br />

<br />
Blowing up the Murrow building in OKC was also <span style="font-style: italic">theater</span>. McVeigh and his conspirators wanted to act out a scene in the Turner Diaries (the author of the Turner Diaries died in 2002). They believed that there was a groundswelling of anti-government frustration. The script in the play they were enacting would result in an armed uprising (overthrowing the US government) as a result of blowing up that building. 168 people died because of their fantasies. 
<br />

<br />
What happened the last time some thugs tried to blow up the WTC? They were hunted down and thrown in jail. What happened the last time some thugs decided to sit outside Langley and shoot folks going to work (at the CIA)? They were hunted down and thrown in jail. What happened when some thugs blew up the Murrow building? They were hunted down and thrown in jail. Nowadays we get <span style="font-style: italic">theater</span> masquerading as justice.
<br />

<br />
The invasion of Iraq is <span style="font-style: italic">theater</span>. It has no real excuse for happening. Nigerian yellowcake? fake. WMD? fake. WMD programs? fake. Able to launch WMD in 45 minutes? fake. Collusion with alqeda? fake. Intentions of WMD programs? another wet dream. Botox in a freezer? there is more in any botox party in Los Angeles. Aluminum rocket tubes going to be used for centrifuging U235/238? only in someone's imagination. Instead invasion of Iraq is a way for Bush to enact his fantasy of a crisis in Babylon, because that is what Revelations claims is needed for the end of the world. Being a rapturist, bush does not believe that he will need to die to enter heaven: just provoke the issues in Revelations in order to bring on the end times. And once the alleged rapture happens, he and his co-conspirators get sucked up to heaven leaving a mess behind that they don't have to care about. Rapturism is a two pronged evil: it is a denial of Christianity (while pretending to be devout Conservative Christianity, go go heresy) and it denies/prevents long term planning (the rapture is coming soon, therefore planning for the long term is denial of their most important beliefs). Pointing out the fallacy of the invasion gets you called a traitor, just like pointing out the emperor's new clothes would get you thrown in jail (when that fable happens in real life). The false dichotomy of the situation is that folks are claiming only 2 choices exist: support the invasion or support alqeda. They are blind to the fact that both of those choices are theater.
<br />

<br />
Dealing with people who are engaged in <span style="font-style: italic">theater</span> is like watching people masturbating: you can see that they are enjoying it, but by watching only their actions, you are missing more than 90% of what is going on. You cannot expect logical behavior from them.

That is an American fantasy. The majority of suicide bombers and the 19 hijackers were college educated. Pretending that they were unwashed bumpkins is foolhardy and ultimately suicidal. Balthemal, you keep forgetting domestic terrorists. Anthrax letters? what anthrax letters? The script of bush's theater requires domestic terrorism to be forgotten. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!

I would characterize the Ranch Recue people as vigilantes not terrorists.

<br />
This may come as a suprise to you, but many states have laws allowing citizens to act in the capacity of law enforcecment.  Some parts of America hold very dearly to the principle of the landowner being expected to be the primary protector of his own property.  That includes hiring guards to partrol your land if you have a tresspassing problem.  Texas Isn't one of those places, it is the center of that universe.
<br />

<br />
I think you are trying to create your own little theater to justify illogical connections.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
Mass destruction and terror are NOT new phenomenon.  The scale may be a little different to reflect our global population density but raising heads on pikes, throwing political miscreants into arenas with lions, lining roads with cruicified insurgents, salting the earth,  poisoning wells and razing cties are all a tiny sampling of terror against civilians for political purpose.
<br />

<br />
The mindset of a fanatic is not new either.  I don't think that americans think of terrorists as unwashed or stupid at all.  They look upon them as cowards.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
Why are you always bringing up this perverted rapturist non-sense with George the Younger?  Rapturinsts do NOT believe that they need to "cause" the end times to be raptured.  The idea is abhorant to Christians.
<br />

<br />
Can I see some evidence please that this coke snorting baseball team owning son of a republican belongs to a pre-rapturist sect and that this sect presupposes that being a protaganist to armeggedon will earn you points in heaven?
<br />

<br />
I don't believe you.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
When you talk about people painting fantasies of evil doers you are desrcribing a psycological contioning for combat common to all people.  The imagination of the enemy as dirty and unwashed is a characterization made to ease the pain of doing harm to others.
<br />

<br />
What sort of picture do you paint and what kind of fantasy to you build when you characterize (and paint in peoples minds) the President of the US as a religious fanatic that believes he can go to heaven by inciting world destruction?<span class="gensmall"></span>
