Wednesday, March 3, 2004 Posted: 10:40 AM EST (1540 GMT)
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. soldiers in Iraq have new gear for dispersing hostile crowds and warding off potential enemy combatants. It blasts earsplitting noise in a directed beam. 
<br />

<br />
The equipment, called a Long Range Acoustic Device, or LRAD, is a so-called "non-lethal weapon" developed after the 2000 attack on the USS Cole off Yemen as a way to keep operators of small boats from approaching U.S. warships. 
<br />

<br />
The devices have been used on some U.S. ships since last summer as part of a suite of protection devices. 
<br />

<br />
Now, the Army and Marines have added this auditory barrage dispenser to their arms ensembles. Troops in Fallujah, a center of insurgency west of Baghdad, and other areas of central Iraq in particular often deal with crowds in which lethal foes intermingle with non-hostile civilians. 
<br />

<br />
The developer of the LRAD, American Technology Corp. of San Diego, recently got a $1.1 million contract from the U.S. Marine Corps to buy the gadgets for units deployed to Iraq. The Army also sent LRADs to Iraq to test on vehicles. 
<br />

<br />
Some of the Iraq-bound devices will be used by members of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, both recently deployed to the western province of Al Anbar, a largely barren, predominantly Sunni Muslim area. 
<br />

<br />
Though not officially part of the military's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate, the 45-pound, dish-shaped device belongs to a developing arsenal of technologies intended not to kill but to deter. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Another such weapon, expected to be tested in the field soon, is the Active Denial System. It seeks to repel enemies with a painful energy beam. </span>
<br />

<br />
Carl Gruenler, vice president of military and government operations for American Technology Corp., said LRADs are "in the beginnings of being used in Baghdad," though he said he lacked "initial feedback" on how they are working. 
<br />

<br />
Dubbed "The Sound of Force Protection" in a company brochure, the devices can broadcast sound files containing warning messages. Or they can be used with electronic translating devices for what amounts to "narrowcasting." 
<br />

<br />
If crowds or potential foes don't respond to the verbal messages, the sonic weapon, which measures 33 inches in diameter, can direct a high-pitched, piercing tone with a tight beam. Neither the LRAD's operators or others in the immediate area are affected. 
<br />

<br />
The devices "place distance between the Marine and their threat, giving him/her more time to sort out a measured and appropriate response," Lt. Col. Susan Noel, force protection officer for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, said in an ATC statement announcing the contract. 
<br />

<br />
Gruenler compares the LRAD's shrill tone to that of smoke detectors, only much louder. It can be as loud as about 150 decibels; smoke detectors are in the 80 to 90 decibel range. 
<br />

<br />
"<span style="font-weight: bold">Inside 100 yards, you definitely don't want to be there," said Gruenler, adding that the device is recommended for a range of 300 yards or less. 
<br />

<br />
Hearing experts say sound that loud and of that high a frequency -- about 2,100 to 3,100 hertz -- could be dangerous if someone were exposed to it long enough. 
<br />

<br />
"That's a sensitive region for developing hearing loss," said Richard Salvi, director of the Center for Hearing and Deafness at the University at Buffalo. "The longer the duration, the more serious it is." </span>
<br />

<br />
Gruenler concedes that permanent hearing damage is possible if someone were exposed to the sound for lengthy periods. 
<br />

<br />
But he said the high-pitched tone is intended to only be used for a few seconds at a time. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
CNN
<br />
Tuesday, January 6, 2004 Posted: 4:37 PM EST (2137 GMT)
<br />

<br />
TIKRIT, Iraq (CNN) -- When American troops conducted a night raid that led to the capture of Saddam Hussein in December, digital technology allowed Army commanders miles away to watch virtually every move. 
<br />

<br />
Some call the 4th Infantry Division the "digital division" because its vehicles are equipped with a system called "Force 21 Base and Command Brigade and Below," or FBCB2. 
<br />

<br />
Other military units have similar systems, but the 4th Division is the first to be fully digital, according to civilian specialists attached to the division. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The Iraq war is the first time the FBCB2 has been used in combat. </span>
<br />

<br />
The secure, digital radio system allows vehicles to be seen on a screen at a tactical operations center -- a mini war room -- in this case at the division's 1st Brigade headquarters in Tikrit. 
<br />

<br />
"The FBCB2 system allows the commanders to see a real-time placement of where their assets are," said Steve Jones, an Army veteran contracted to maintain the digital communications system at the base. 
<br />

<br />
Assets -- military parlance for tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, helicopters and Humvees -- are represented by blue symbols on one of three screens in the war room. 
<br />

<br />
The symbols are placed over topographical maps or satellite images of central Iraq. So-called "enemy" assets are represented by red symbols. 
<br />

<br />
A civilian, Jones is on loan from Mantech, a Virginia-based information technologies company. 
<br />

<br />
"Maps are a thing of the past," Jones said, referring to clear acetate screens that operation planners overlay onto paper maps when preparing missions. 
<br />

<br />
Digital specialists say the new technology helps eliminate human error and technical accuracy issues with the old way of drawing maps. 
<br />

<br />
"You have to make sure [the screens] are drawn perfectly to the scale of the map," said Jones, a wiry former military police officer who spent six years in the Army. 
<br />

<br />
"If one layer is out of place, then that shifts and basically, you have a problem." 
<br />

<br />
In the war room, division tacticians use an Army Battle Command System, or ABCS, that is networked together by a fiber-optic cable, said Larry Davis. 
<br />

<br />
The goateed civilian is a former Army officer now working as a network engineer for Northup Grumman Mission Systems, a Los Angeles-based software developer. 
<br />

<br />
Commanders use a Maneuver Control System with a graphics program to create orders for missions such as Operation Red Dawn, the raid that led to Saddam's capture December 13. 
<br />

<br />
"Anything you can do on paper, you can do on the computer," said Clarence Joseph, a retired command sergeant major contracted as a digital specialist from Telesis Corp. 
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
The Army's FBCB2 system uses blue symbols on digitally updated maps to represent the location of "friendly forces."   
<br />
Joseph said operation orders are pushed out to troops in FBCB2-equipped vehicles in the field. 
<br />

<br />
"Instead of having a map that has to be updated every few hours, it is a real-time map that is updated as the vehicles move. That way the battle captains can adjust the way they are fighting their battle," Jones said. 
<br />

<br />
In the vehicles, troops use a computer monitor, sealed keyboard, and 6- to 10-gigabyte hard drives with a 512MHz or 333MHz data processor. 
<br />

<br />
The gear is fused into a series of thick, metallic protective boxes situated between the vehicle's passenger and driver seats. 
<br />

<br />
"This is a normal computer that you would find in your house, but the Army has made it "ruggedized,'" so it can survive war zone environments, said Mike Iacobacci, a civilian field service representative attached to the 1st Brigade. 
<br />

<br />
The contractor with the shaved-head said he traded his Army uniform years ago for a technician's civvies. Iacobacci is often seen on base tweaking FBCB2 equipment and sometimes runs into soldiers with whom he used to serve. 
<br />

<br />
The vehicle passenger, usually a higher-ranking soldier than the driver, uses the keyboard or touch screen monitor to access real-time maps and track troop movements -- even send commands via e-mail. 
<br />

<br />
"I send free text, but I can also send log reports and log the status for equipment when I need it, as well as for personnel when I need it," said the 1st Brigade's top enlisted man, Command Sgt. Maj. Lawrence Wilson, during a bumpy Humvee ride outside Tikrit. 
<br />

<br />
While typing an e-mail to his troops in the passenger seat, Wilson pointed out a low-tech solution to keeping the gear up and running: "We use a pencil eraser to clean the wire connections. It may seem silly, but it works." 
<br />

<br />
Not impressed? Wireless Internet, palm pilots and instant messaging may be common in industrialized nations, but soldiers are quick to point out that Iraq is not one of them. 
<br />

<br />
4th Division soldiers consider the secure, instantaneous digital radio network a technological wonder. 
<br />

<br />
Iacobacci said information is sent between troops in the field via a voice radio system, Internet controller and global positioning system all also fused into the vehicle's chassis. 
<br />

<br />
He said an enhanced position location reporting system -- similar to an Internet server attached to the back of the vehicle -- helps vehicles on different servers communicate with one another and with commanders in the tactical operations center. 
<br />

<br />
Civilian digital specialists in Tikrit say the Army is keen for them to live and work in the war zone because of their past military experiences. 
<br />

<br />
"We understand the mindset and what we're getting into," said Davis, who spent 10 years in the military. "We're like the warranty specialists willing to fix it on location." 
<br />

<br />
Most civilian specialists represent the companies that designed the software -- much of it too complex for Army technicians. 
<br />

<br />
"The Army is capable of running the software, but if it breaks, it is our expertise that allows us to fix it," Davis said. 
<br />

<br />
On the night troops found Saddam in an underground crawlspace 9 miles (15 km) southeast of Tikrit, some officers watching events from the 1st Brigade's tactical operations center said technology couldn't replace human eyes. 
<br />

<br />
"I really wanted to be on the ground," said Maj. Stan Murphy, who heads the intelligence unit that secured information that led to Saddam's capture. "I was wondering what it was like out there." 
<br />

<br />
The man who led the raid agreed, saying there is no substitute for the human factor. 
<br />

<br />
"At the core of it is a soldier that imagines what must be done, thinks through how to get it done, then gets it done. The technology is just an enabler," said Col. James Hickey, the 1st Brigade's commander. 
<br />

<br />
The civilian specialists concede this enabler doesn't come cheap, but they are reluctant to talk about the technology's price tag. 
<br />

<br />
"How much does the equipment cost? This is equipment that will save soldiers' lives," Jones said. 
<br />

<br />
"If a soldier is attacked, other units can find him with this equipment. It is worth it that soldier have the best equipment [they] can have." </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
  
<br />
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The successful test of a laser-based missile defense system may mean Israel will soon have a potent new weapon to defend against rocket attacks. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">
<br />
In a test conducted on Tuesday, a 122 mm Katyusha rocket was fired from New Mexico's White Sands missile range. Seconds later, a powerful chemical laser several miles down range successfully tracked and destroyed the rocket with an invisible beam. </span>
<br />

<br />
The U.S. Army said the test was of breakthrough technology called the Tactical High Energy Laser, designed by TRW Corp. 
<br />

<br />
"Israel has made it very clear that it will protect its people along its northern border," said Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon. "The United States has worked with Israel in the past to meet its security needs, and we'll continue to meet with Israel in the future." 
<br />

<br />
    
<br />
Israel is fortifying its Lebanon border with an electronic fence, beefed-up army outposts and high-tech detection devices to replace its abandoned military presence inside Lebanon. 
<br />

<br />
Israel had hoped to have the anti-Katyusha laser fully deployed before giving up its buffer zone in Lebanon, but the $190 million dollar project is slightly behind schedule and over budget. 
<br />

<br />
It could be deployed as soon as early next year, if further testing shows the laser can destroy multiple rockets at once. 
<br />

Though the United States picked up part of the costs of the test and has nothing like the rocket-killing laser in its arsenal, it has no plans to field the system, officials said. With no threat from its neighbors, the United States wants a system that is more mobile and has the capability to defeat a wider range of missiles. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

				I'd say it's about damn time we perfected some of this promising weapon technology.
<br />

<br />
Generally I think WMDs are bad, because there simply are never that many bad guys. Madmen and despots with an axe to grind against the entire world are the only ones to benefit from that kind of weapon. These other weapon types however are a good thing, especially ones that have high accuracy or low casualty rates, or provide good defense. And it's about damn time we got some working lasers. They are the only thing that can obsolete missile technology.
<br />

<br />
I know they are developing new combat armors using nanofiber technology, spinning the armor from spinneretts just like a spider. It takes a very long time to make even a single piece, but the resulting armor can take a direct hit from a fucking <span style="font-style: italic">tank round</span> and not break. It weights next to nothing too, far less than conventional gear. That's damn impressive. I think I saw this on the "superweapons" discovery series. A soldier wearing this only has to worry about the impact from conventional bullets, because no bullet can actually penentrate the armor. Sounds like something that would be useful in aircraft as well.
<br />

<br />
I've also read about directional bullets... that is, bullets that are smart enough to steer towards a painted target or a heat source. If memory serves, they have grooves on the actual bullet that give it some degree of flight control, and some retractable obstruction in the groove itself to impede or allow airflow. Due to the high speeds, even a tiny change in the groove can result in a decent turn. Wouldn't expect much use out of it in close range, but for spraying a field down or sniping from long range it would be very useful.
<br />

<br />
EMP bombs. They deliver an EMP payload annihilates anything modern in the blast radius. I have read articles about the development of this tech but I've never heard of it being used anywhere. Very handy for sticking your opponent back into the dark ages, and the only casualties are the folks who were using a pacemaker.
<br />

<br />
My favorite one was this fiendish runway killing bomb that was developed by the British. Parts of the bomb were made to look like runway debris, but were actually tiny, motion-sensitive bomblets themselves that became active shortly after impact and detonation of the main payload.. Anyone clearing the mess off of the runway who was unfortunate enough to bump one would get blasted as if he'd been standing on a standard frag grenade. That's such a mean weapon... but it definitely does its job.
<br />

<br />
There will always be someone to fight. Be prepared, or be conquered.<br />

				Wanted to post earlier but school is eating me alive, it took me a few to get back to this...
<br />

<br />
The 3rd Quoted story is of interest to me for several reasons and I hope to make a few comments that might help you get a better understanding of the technologies I can speak about...
<br />

<br />
1st off...the Laser test site at White Sands missile range has been in existance since the early 70-80's (likely longer) and has been a joint venture of the military since that time, sponsored by various branches of the military and several of the Heavy Duty military contractors. The original ideas were to combine the two projects since any improvement in laser technology would need to be taken into account by the same people on the base designing on the missiles, countermeasures, and support systems, (i.e. targeting, tracking, telemetry, ect). 
<br />

<br />
My knowledge comes from personal experience at the site in the 1980's.
<br />

<br />
At the time the navy was testing the SEALITE laser weapons system from the naval test facility at WSMR. At the time the generator was too large to fit into anything less that a shipsized platform. The technology was also not as reliable and or as efficient as todays present systems, they were and likely still are using mirrors to reflect the laser to missile targets and creating "targeting windows" to assist in attempting multitarget attack senario's. The system at the time was highly advanced, the laser turret being no bigger than a small 2 person amusement park ride car or just slightly larger than a "good sized" oldfashioned clothes washer or dryer. Examples sited were the replacement of some of the older 30mm ships guns...problem being the need for space for the high energy generators...both in manpower to run the generators as well as the need for a single generator for each gun to run them and some of ideas at the time of running the system as a battery of guns. 
<br />

<br />
But arent Subs Nuclear? Isnt that enuff power? That answer is NO, turning a turbine that has gears and creates its own mechanical advantage of tourque vs the need for raw. safe, controllable power... most people arent aware that nuclear subs create power just like the old steam boilers, its power is simply electrical steam power run turbines. Safe Steady and efficient but without the step-up amplification needed for generation of the levels of power that a Large Laser capable of burning thur a missile caseing needs. It HAS to very quickly power up, target aquire and lock on and fire the laser system.
<br />

<br />
In laymens terms you need a standard generator that runs the support systems and a 2nd Fast, Rapid fire, Step up generator specificlly designed and dedicated to the weapons system, and the entire Fast power system must coordinate with the standard generator's duplicate systems for targeting, and radar system....
<br />

<br />
Confused?? Note the weapon systems name...Tactical High Energy Laser, designed by TRW Corp. 
<br />

<br />
Tactical means its going to likely be stationary, for fortifications or "strong points" along their border...Maybe inside something the size of a semitrailer...(based on the original laser systems building size) it had to be atleast 55ft High x 300ft Long x 120ft Wide...An thats if my memory serves me correctly...thats been nearly 20 years... <img src="images/smiles/ponder.gif" alt="ponder" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
If you have seen any footage of the old SDI programs most of this that Im talking about was from that time frame...While Im sure things are ALOT better now a days, Im also positive that our "younger" generation of upcomming engineers prolly HAVE NOT been able to Leap ahead and SIGNIFICANTLY improve the system...
<br />

<br />
I've been around alot of REALLY bright guys, but at the time the people at WSMR were the Absolute BEST in the BIZ. And most of them were either fresh out of ideas or limited by the technology available at the time...granted things HAVE changed, likely there have been great strides ahead. But If you know anything about power generation, We've run in to a major stumbleing block, We cant make powerplants any bigger...Most of the major problems caused by Enron in California were symptamatic (sp?) of the inability to get more power out of our commercial level power plants...The Armed Forces continully CULL the flock of college grads looking for that 1 Brilliant SOB that can fix their power problem... <img src="images/smiles/banghead.gif" alt="banghead" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
I will say that Ive seen some of the test footage provided by the Army on the older missile systems, and their HIGHLY accurate, extremely fast, powerful and capable of dealing with most attacking missile systems... Theres also several countermeasure systems that can destroy missiles without any missile system used...These systems are just not what the enemy would be expecting and range from the obvious ECM systems to proximety systems that have there own unique systems of dealing with incomming missiles...
<br />

<br />
And speaking of missiles, remember the old saying you've got just long enuff to bendover and kiss your %@$# goodbye....? Some of the NEW stuff IS that fast and that powerful...What was left was NOT MUCH...best I can describe WITHOUT STEPING OVER THE LINE IS..."it was like taking a 10 gage shotgun to a rabbit at about 10ft...." <img src="images/smiles/faint.gif" alt="faint" border="0" />       
<br />

<br />
Uncle Sam may not have Millions of troops, but the stuff hes got is State of the Art...IN BANG BANG<br />

				Laser weapons always end up hitting a brick wall. It is not the power issue. It has to do with the fact that any laser powerful enough to burn through missiles ends up creating plasma in its way: it turns the air it passes through into plasma. Plasma ends up absorbing almost all of the energy. The current (meaning last decade or 2) tricks to avoiding the plasma channel are to pulse the laser. Adaptive mirrors (they bend so that they stay focused even though the beam is wiggling) are another. Making the lasers 100x as powerful won't solve the plasma issue. Using frequencies of light that don't get absorbed by the atmosphere can help. That is why effort is being put into "free electron lasers." The flash you see from lightning is the air turning into plasma. 
<br />

<br />
If you want to build your own CO2 laser, there was an Amateur Scientist column in Scientific American (the particular column was published in 1969) that should have been called <span style="font-style: italic">High School Kids Build Death Ray</span>. A 40 watt CO2 laser will crack bricks, shatter glass and instantly set wood on fire. Please be more careful than I was. Looking back, I am surprised I did not kill or maim myself and my friends. Or burn down northern indiana. Although many folks I know would have been pleased if I did burn it down. Do not use a powerful infrared laser to try to make crop circles. 
<br />

<br />
There was a Scientific American article several years ago (in the 1980s), when SDI was the state religion, explaining how the proposed missile defence systems can't work. And by can't work, they can't work for the same reason that perpetual motion machines can't work: they violated physics. The article also showed 4 simple countermeasures that would totally defeat any directed energy weapon: spinning the missile, using polished metal, pumping small amounts of fluid out the nose cone over the body of the missle or switching to cruise missles. Any system capable of shooting down cruise missiles would also be capable of shooting down passenger aircraft. Can you imagine the headlines? <span style="font-style: italic">Teen hacker shoots down airplanes, film at eleven! </span> It is a pity that the improvements in software development and computer power that would have been needed for SDI still have not shown up. If the necessary improvements in software development had come about, there would be nothing like viruses, computers would be able to talk to you as conversationally as other humans do and programs the size and complexity of Windows would have exactly zero bugs in them while being made on time and on budget.
<br />

<br />
Later in the 1980s there was a staged test where it was claimed that a laser blew up a missle on a stand. It was later shown that this test was publicised to make the Soviets think we had something that did not exist, and it was faked with pyrotechnic charges. Just as fake as NBC'%&$*-em-up blowup." Only this test cost the taxpayers around $180,000,000 to fake. Gotta love how those defense contracters embezzle money with bulldozers and hide it behind "national defense." 
<br />

<br />
Somewhere in storage, is a 1956 Popular Mechanics magazine with a funny thing on the cover that looks like an array of trumpets. It is a sonic weapon that was invented in France that was capable of destroying buildings at a  distance using focused sound waves. It could also emulsify people who were inside tanks (look it up in a dictionary). I do not know why the technology was abandoned, probably had something to do with the ~150dB audio signal tending to emulsify the operators too. Would fit on the back of a jeep and you would need to tow a compressor to power it. Buildings damaged by focused pairs of this weapon looked like they took earthquake damage rather than directed energy. Commercial jet engines are around 110-125dB.
<br />

<br />
Infrasonics can be used to make crowds disperse. Rumors claim that the British have a system which induces nausea, vomiting and uncontrollable diarhea in crowds. Probably just the spice girls tho.<br />

<br />
and as for the large EMP, consider something that's already been made by electrical engineers (Slava Persion for example, a student and Stony Brock).  He made a HERF (directional EMP) which he's used to stall cars and incapacitate computers.. directional is a little better then bigass explosion eh?

Too bad to reload you have to physically change the entire barrel. Kinda makes it difficult to supply airborne systems with enough ammo to do multiple missions.<br />

				This is a new system thats been thought to be around for quite awhile...
<br />

<br />
Expect deployment in L.A. in about 2 years...
<br />

<br />
ANAHEIM, Calif. - The Pentagon is rushing into service in Iraq a pair of technologies developed under its advanced research arm: a Humvee-mounted sensor for pinpointing hostile gunfire and a "command post of the future" designed to cut down on combat leaders' travel and streamline decision-making.
<br />

<br />
The tools come courtesy of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is known mostly for its imaginative, over-the-horizon work. Current DARPA projects include underwater holograms that disguise submarines and artificial human "tissue" for testing vaccines against biological and chemical weapons.
<br />

<br />
But urgent war zone needs have prompted the Pentagon agency to get to soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan inventions ranging from handheld computerized language translators to thousands of pen-sized water purifiers.
<br />

<br />
The sniper detector, named "Boomerang" and developed by BBN Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., is all about diluting the element of surprise in urban ambushes.
<br />

<br />
Sensors atop an aluminum pole on the back of a Humvee pick up supersonic shock waves to give an approximate location of gunfire, and sound waves measured from the muzzle blast narrow it some more.
<br />

<br />
A cigarette box-sized display on the dashboard or windshield then shows the findings. "Incoming, 5 o'clock," says a speaker inside the box.
<br />

<br />
Assailants in urban Iraq are often inexperienced, missing on the first shot, said Karen Wood, who supervised development of "Boomerang" in just two months. They also tend to be armed with AK-47s rather than more accurate rifles, giving soldiers time to return fire or get out of harm's way.
<br />

<br />
DARPA tested the Boomerang on a snowy December day at the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory in Quantico, Va. The Marines and Army in Iraq (DARPA won't say which units) then volunteered to take 50, becoming the first to try them in battle.
<br />

<br />
DARPA's goal is to lower the cost of a sniper detector from $10,000 to $3,000 and to link them in a network that lets soldiers throughout Baghdad know sniper whereabouts. And while hostile gunfire doesn't pose near the lethal threat to U.S. troops as craftily rigged roadside bombs, every little bit helps.
<br />

<br />
"Is a 20 percent solution better than nothing?" Wood said. "If it saves lives, a partial solution is better than nothing."
<br />

<br />
New computer systems designed to streamline the command bureaucracy _ letting senior officers collaborate in real time with visual tools _ will get tested in the field by the 1st Cavalry Division, which will take 50 such computer banks to Iraq in about a month. Half will go in the division's Baghdad headquarters while the rest are sprinkled at eight command posts in the area. All will be connected by one overarching wireless network.
<br />

<br />
Each bank of computers has three screens: one for the user's own work, one for 3-D simulated battlefields and a third to peer into what's happening on other systems throughout the city. Commanders will also be able to talk to each other using voice over Internet technology.
<br />

<br />
The network is designed to sharply reduce the need for commanders to crisscross the city for meetings while hastening the flow of information. Instead of sending an e-mail request, for example, they can simply drop in on each other's computers for data they need.
<br />

<br />
"Right now we have to bring everyone to the same place to have a meeting, and Baghdad is a dangerous place," said Ryan Paterson, project manager of DARPA's "Command Post of the Future," which is being developed by Maya Viz LLC of Pittsburgh and three other companies.
<br />

<br />
DARPA had been working with a few generals since 1999 but had no takers until wartime, said Steve Roth, Maya Viz's chief executive officer. "It was limping along on pennies," he said.
<br />

<br />
Then, Maj. Gen. Peter Chiarelli, the 1st Cav commander, invited him to Fort Hood, Texas, for a demonstration in October. Chiarelli immediately agreed to test it in Iraq.
<br />

<br />
Other inventions highlighted by DARPA earlier this month at a conference that coincided with the Grand Challenge desert robotic race were geared toward girding soldiers against the elements, improving their field nutrition and cleansing dirty water.
<br />

<br />
Special Operations forces recently tried a handheld vacuum chamber that sucks heat from the body, much like a radiator does for an automobile. They hit the treadmill in a 95-degree room at a Stanford University lab, saddled with backpacks. During breaks, they stuck their hands in the bubble-shaped vacuum, developed by Avacore Technologies Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.
<br />

<br />
The Special Operations Command was encouraged enough by the results to ask for more devices, which they will test on their own, said Dr. Brett Giroir, deputy director of DARPA's defense sciences office. DARPA's next step is designing a body cooler small enough to fit inside a soldier's boot.
<br />

<br />
DARPA operates a $2.8 billion annual budget with only 240 employees. Project managers such as The Boomerang project's Wood generally stay only four years, a practice aimed at preventing researchers from getting too comfortable.
<br />

<br />
"You have four years to make a difference and you feel the clock ticking the moment you walk in the door," said Wood. "It guarantees that you have fresh ideas coming through the door."<br />

Invisible beam tops list of nonlethal weapons
<br />

<br />
WASHINGTON - Test subjects can't see the invisible beam from the Pentagon's new, Star Trek-like weapon, but no one has withstood the pain it produces for more than three seconds.
<br />
People who volunteered to stand in front of the directed energy beam say they felt as if they were on fire. When they stepped aside, the pain disappeared instantly.
<br />

<br />
 The long-range column of millimeter-wave energy is known as the "Active Denial System" for its ability to prevent an aggressor from advancing. Senior military officials, who plan to deliver the device for troop evaluation this fall, say years of testing has produced no sign it will lead to health effects beyond perhaps causing skin to temporarily redden.
<br />

<br />
It is among the most potent of a new generation of futuristic, "less-than-lethal" weapons being developed by the Defense Department - tools that could dramatically alter the way police control riots and soldiers fight wars.
<br />

<br />
Other nonlethal devices undergoing tests include "superlubricants" that could make a road or runway too slippery for car or airplane tires to gain traction; directed sound waves to drive people away from an area; and nets able to stop cars.
<br />

<br />
Marine Col. David Karcher, who heads the Pentagon's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate, says the energy beam is aimed at helping troops and police in confusing situations by offering options "between bullets and a bullhorn."
<br />

<br />
Marine Capt. Dan McSweeney, a spokesman for the Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate, pointed to "instances in Iraq where crowd situations have unfortunately ended in violence" and death.
<br />

<br />
Karcher and other military officials are trying to alleviate fears that the device might be misused to harm civilians or converted into a torture machine that leaves no marks.
<br />

<br />
In an attempt to anticipate how the world would greet the new weapon, the Air Force this month asked social science graduate students at the University of Minnesota and other colleges for help.
<br />

<br />
Researchers were offered $12,000 to spend the summer reviewing literature and assessing how Americans and other cultures might react to its use.
<br />

<br />
In the solicitation, Maj. Jonathan Drummond of the Air Force's Directed Energy Bioeffects Division noted that the Active Denial System could provide U.S. forces "with a nonlethal capability in military operations other than war." Among possible uses, he listed peacekeeping, humanitarian operations and crowd control.
<br />

<br />
Introduction of such a device in either noncombat or wartime situations could raise thorny questions: Would it be acceptable to inflict so much pain on unruly protesters? How would such a weapon be viewed if used on crowds in Third World countries? Would it violate international humanitarian principles if used in battle? Might it be used secretly during interrogations to torture suspected terrorists into cooperating?
<br />

<br />
Karcher said the Active Denial System "is absolutely not designed or intended or built" to be a torture device.
<br />

<br />
"To use this as any sort of torture device would be in direct violation of" the Pentagon's definition of nonlethal weapons, he said. "Nor, as professionals, would any of us sign up for it."
<br />

<br />
But in an era of secret interrogations of al-Qaida suspects and revelations of U.S. abuse of prisoners at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, Executive Director Doug Johnson of the Minneapolis-based Center for Torture Victims is skeptical.
<br />

<br />
"It seems fundamentally a weapon that's designed to create a great deal of pain and fear," Johnson said. "The concern I would have is ... once this kind of technology is available and there's a perception that it's safe and nonlethal, it seems like a natural device to be used in interrogations.
<br />

<br />
"Is it torture if it only creates a sensation of pain, but leaves no marks and no long-term damage? I would say yes. Torture is primarily a psychological device, and finding different ways to use the body against the mind has been the struggle of torture technologies for thousands of years."
<br />

<br />
He said "human history would demonstrate" that once a potential torture technology is available, it usually is put into action.
<br />

<br />
Karcher and other military officials stressed that the device has received interim approvals from international treaty conventions, has twice passed Pentagon legal reviews and will be subject to clear rules of engagement.
<br />

<br />
Eleven years in the making at a cost of more than $50 million, the Active Denial System is still years from deployment. It weighs about 4 tons and consists largely of a big dish and antenna that are mounted on a Humvee multipurpose vehicle.
<br />

<br />
But researchers are hoping to miniaturize it, Karcher said. Air Force officials want to work with the prime contractor, the Raytheon Corp., to design a version that could be mounted on a military transport plane so its beam could cut a broader swath on a battlefield.
<br />

<br />
Once an operator has aimed the antenna using a scope, the press of a button sends out a column of millimeter-wave, electromagnetic energy at the speed of light. Pentagon officials say that the weapon's exact reach and its column size are classified, but that it can extend beyond the 550-meter effective range of bullets. Its intensity is the same at any distance.
<br />

<br />
Susan Levine, the Pentagon's project manager for the energy beam, said years of tests on humans and animals enabled researchers to establish a margin of safety. After several seconds, the device automatically shuts off to avoid burning its target, she said.
<br />

<br />
When the beam hits an individual, it penetrates 1/64th of an inch beneath the skin and heats water molecules to 130 degrees in less than a second.
<br />

<br />
"It tricks the pain sensors into thinking they're on fire," said Rich Garcia, a spokesman for the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, N.M.
<br />

<br />
Garcia knows firsthand. He was among hundreds of test volunteers, standing in a doorway with his back facing the device.
<br />

<br />
"They did a full body back shot," he said. "It hit in the small of my back first. For the first millisecond, it just felt like the skin was warming up. Then it got warmer and warmer and you felt like it was on fire."
<br />

<br />
He said he lunged out of the doorway.
<br />

<br />
"As soon as you're away from that beam your skin returns to normal and there is no pain," Garcia said. "I thought to myself, 'Why you wimp. You know it's not causing any damage. You'll be able to override it.' Each of the next three times, I was on there a little bit longer.
<br />

<br />
"The fourth one was the longest. It was about two seconds. It felt like my hair was on fire."
<br />

<br />
The beam easily penetrates clothing, he said, because clothes are porous, though a thin suit of armor would block it.

				Intresting new bunker buster ideas comming from Iraq... Hello Big Blue & Thanks Osama  <img src="images/smiles/snicker.gif" alt="hehe" border="0" />

'Bunker busters' may grow to 30,000 pounds
<br />
U.S. Air Force seeking deep impact on hard-to-reach targets
<br />
From Barbara Starr
<br />
CNN Washington Bureau
<br />
Tuesday, July 20, 2004 Posted: 3:01 PM EDT (1901 GMT) 
<br />

<br />
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It's just an idea on paper, but the U.S. Air Force is asking defense contractors how they might develop a 30,000-pound, precision-guided bomb that could destroy targets deep underground, in caves or in hardened bunkers.
<br />

<br />
Air Force officials said the proposed weapon, called the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, would be substantially larger than the current penetrating bomb -- the GBU-28, a 5,000-pound weapon.  The proposed bomb would be about six times the weight of this "bunker buster," the laser-guided GBU-28. 
<br />

<br />
Military officials said the most likely use of such a weapon would be against underground targets such as those found in North Korea.
<br />

<br />
The Air Force initially considered the development of a 30,000-pound penetrating bomb before the Iraq war, but funding and technical challenges stifled movement. 
<br />

<br />
After the invasion, Air Force weapons experts examined several bomb sites in Iraq and learned targets could not be fully destroyed using the current inventory of conventional weapons.
<br />

<br />
However, Air Force officials said they are uncertain whether the concept of a bigger bomb can be brought to reality or that there would be available funding.
<br />

<br />
The Air Force concept calls for the bomb to be deployed on B-2 or B-52 bombers. The weapon would be guided by use of Global Positioning System satellite coordinates.
<br />

<br />
Engineering obstacles must be overcome, according to Air Force officials. 
<br />

<br />
One challenge would be the need to carry two bombs on an aircraft to keep the plane stable in flight. Both bombs probably would need to be dropped at the same time for the bomber to maintain level flight, officials said.
<br />

<br />
Air Force officials said the bomb's structure would incorporate some type of heavy alloy that would make up most of the weight, allowing it to penetrate the target. An advanced or "smart" fuse also would be part of the system, so that detonation would occur only after the bomb reached the target, they said.
<br />

<br />
The Air Force said it is prepared to spend $11 million on weapon design and demonstration, with testing possibly beginning in 2006.
<br />

<br />
This bomb concept, informally known as the "Big Blue," differs from the Massive Ordnance Air Blast, a 20,000-pound weapon packed with 18,000 pounds of explosives. The MOAB bomb is designed to explode above ground for destruction of widespread surface targets such as troops and tanks.
<br />
