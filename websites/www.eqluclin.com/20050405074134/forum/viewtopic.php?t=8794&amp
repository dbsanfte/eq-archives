Wrong.  There was a HUGE change in this circa 1776, in case they didn't tell you about it.  Prior to the Declaration of Independence the King, by whatever title he was known, owned everything, including YOU.  Only he had rights, everyone else had whatever priviledges he decided to pass out.  The PEOPLE of this country took arms, and through lucky circumstance, tossed his %@$# out of government and took SOVEREINTY unto themselves.  You can @#%$ and moan about the fact they attributed their inherant rights as God given, but they took them in hand, by force of arms, the traditional method of acquiring power and property.  (Rights derive from property, btw.)  After various other arraingments they instituted the Constitution, which grats TO government SOME priviledges, and they continued to reserve all rights unto themselves.  Rights derive from God, or from yourself, if you prefer not to involve the Almighty.

If that's what you think, you are reading it wrong.  In fact, you are reading the whole Bill of Rights wrong.  The first 10 were instituted, and in fact, insisted on, in order to preserve INDIVIDUAL rights.

Hmm, that's one reading.  The Constitution gives a limited list of what the Federal government is allowed to do.  Everything else belongs to individuals, or States.  If not explicitly allocated to the States, it belongs to the individuals.

That Amendment is commonly known as the right to bear arms, although that's more what it has turned into as opposed to what it was intended to be. The 2nd Amendment was created to allow the right of a State to maintain an organized militia and to prevent the federal government from disarming the members of that militia and thereby leaving those people helpless against governmental abuse. It has since turned into something else entirely, mainly as a result of groups like the NRA. I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing, although there are a lot of pros to strict gun control provided it was effectively enforced (which it wouldn't be in the current state of this country). The original purpose of the Amendment is null and void, as no militia in this country has the training and armament necessary to defend itself from the government. Personal firearms and light combat training &lt; tanks and trained soldiers with modern military equipment.

What a load of hogwash.
<br />

<br />
That's the anti-gunner lie, based on a misreading of a secondary clause.  The Second Amendment, like all of the first 10, elucidates SOME of the rights of the PEOPLE, i.e. individuals.  The Right to Bear Arms is an individual right, and intended to document and specifiy the inherant right of individuals to own MILITARY grade hardware.  In fact, the ONLY Supreme Court decision directly concerning the 2nd held that some fella didn't have a right to a particular shotgun specifically because it DIDN'T have military virtue, which is a bogus decision anyway, as shotguns have particular utility as a military weapon, just ask past and present members of the military.  This is exactly the kind of misinformation now taught in the public schools, no wonder you are so wrong.

Yeah, right.  You really believe that.  I met L. Ron Scamster.  I knew people who were in the bar (at a WorldCon I think) when he made his drunken boast.  It's a scam, using the cult model, to tap people for money.  It seems to be especially successful on rich and famous people who have no moral foundation, and who probably feel guilty about their success.
<br />

<br />
Whatever you may think of Bednarik's lecture style, if you really want to know what the Constitution is all about, you should put in the time to check out his lectures.  As he, and others, point out, we don't have to wonder what the writers of the Constitution meant, because they wrote down what the meant.  Check out the Federalist Papers, and the Anti-Federalist Papers.<br />

There was a HUGE change in this circa 1776, in case they didn't tell you about it. Prior to the Declaration of Independence the King, by whatever title he was known, owned everything, including YOU. Only he had rights, everyone else had whatever priviledges he decided to pass out. The PEOPLE of this country took arms, and through lucky circumstance, tossed his %@$# out of government and took SOVEREINTY unto themselves.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
That in no way conflicts with what I said, which was "rights are granted by government/society in the first place."  Monarchy is still a government, and people leading a revolt and changing what their rights are still a form of government or a function of society.
<br />

<br />
I went through two years of law school before I decided I disliked the concept of being a lawyer.  I spent almost a full year of that studying Constitutional law.  I don't know where you got the idea that the first ten Amendments were concerned wholly with individual peoples' rights.  The first and tenth deal with the rights of groups and the individual states.
<br />

<br />
The 2nd is NOT the right to own military grade hardware, Fallonn.  I don't know where the hell <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> idea came from.  The 2nd Amendment was the right of the state to maintain an organized militia, and to keep people from being disarmed and therefore defenseless against tyranny or abuse by the government.  That is it, end of list.  I was not saying that I see anything wrong with owning guns, and in fact I personally see nothing wrong with owning guns.  That does not, however, negate the fact that the original intent of the amendment has gotten warped over the years, as have many of the others.
<br />

<br />
Why the hell did you feel a need to start a whole new thread on this when there's several already going?  You state it as an attempt to counter "propoganda promulgated by the public school system", but you're making a massive assumption right there that views people express on the matter are parroted from what they were taught (in most of our cases) 10+ years ago, and making the assumption in the first place that that is what they were taught.

				I would like to point out that in the entire history of the constitution, there is NOTHING in it (with one exception) that limits the individual. Everything in the constitution outlines the limits of government.
<br />

<br />
The only exception to this rule was prohibition, and it was struck out a few years after it's disasterous adoption. The framework of our federal government is specificly a limited one. It is that way by design and those limits only get spelled out for government.
<br />

<br />
The Bill of Rights was adopted several years later specificly spelling out more limits on government. Notice that the constitution doesn't say that the people get to have this right or that right. The constitution is always phrased to specify limits on government.
<br />

<br />
The preamble to the Bill of Rights starts with:
<br />

<br />

<br />
THE Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution."

</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
"In order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers"
<br />

<br />
The constitution is written only to delineate the limits of government and to forbid it limiting it's people especially in certain areas like religion, free speach, property, due process, etc.
<br />

<br />
Rights are natural and not given by government. Government exists through the willfull granting of privelege to government by the people in order to have a harmonious community.

The monarchy dropped it's ownership of us and it's subjugation of our natural rights were realized when the Paris Treaty 1783 was signed.<br />

				Military service can't count as slavery because slaves don't get paid, and don't get a retirement pension.  I know folks complain about the military pay and benefits, but compaired to many I graduated from high school with I am way better off and I don't know any of them that can say they get to have a retirement check coming in at the age of 38.  I suppose it could fit indentured servitude though.

Judge Andrew Napolitano, Nixon prosecutor, youngest life tenured Superior Court judge in New Jersey history, now author (see link), and commentator, had this to say in an interview in the March 2005 reason magazine:

We are in a fit of constitutional chaos when the government views constitutional guarantees as discretionary.  As Americans, we order our lives on the belief that we have extraordinary freedoms.  We believe those freedoms dont come from the government.  They come from our humanity.  The government doesnt <span style="font-style: italic">give</span> freedom; the government under the Constitution is restrained from <span style="font-style: italic">interfering</span> with it.  I can basically say whatever I want about the government.  I can basically travel wherever I want to go.  I can basically worship however I see fit.  If the government comes to the view that these freedoms are discretionary, no matter how noble the stated [reason to restrict them] may be, then were in a state of constitutional chaos.  We will not be able to order our lives based on freedom.  We wont know who will be prosecuted or wholl just be swept away.

.about natural law and positivism
<br />

<br />
Scholars and lawyers and jurists and people interested in this have always debated what is the source of our rights.  There are many, many schools of thought, but they basically fall into two categories.  One says that our rights come by virtue of our humanity because we are created in Gods image and likeness.  Because God is perfectly free, he his instilled in us all the yearnings for freedom that we have: freedom of thought, freedom to develop ones personality, freedom to express oneself, freedom of movement, freedom of religion, freedom of association, etc.  That school of thought is known as the natural law.  Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration; James Madison, who wrote the Constitution; and and virtually all the Founding Fathers, even though some were deists and some were atheists, they were to a person believers in the natural law.
<br />

<br />
The other school of thought is sometimes called positivism, sometimes legal realism.  It basically says that the law is whatever the lawgiver says it is.  As long as the lawgiver follows its own rules, whatever it says is the law.  So positivism would say the majority in a democracy always rules.  There are no minority rights because there are no brakes on the majority will.  If the majority wants to get rid of the First Amendment, the majority rules; there is no First Amendment.  Therefore, theres no protection for freedom of speech.  If the majority want to take the property belonging to person A and give it to person B because the majority rules, the majority can do that because, again, there are no natural rights that would allow person A to keep his property against the will of the government.
<br />

<br />
The attraction to positivism is it is pure democracy.  The majority literally always rules.  Or whoever is in power always rules.  Positivism didnt rear its head successfully, in my view, until the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when we took a decided step toward a centralization of power in Washington and ultimately toward many socialistic programs that we now have because FDR was the ultimate positivist who believed whatever law he signed was a good law and there were no brakes on that.
<br />

<br />
[The FDR era] began, in my view, the dark part of American history where the federal government believed that it could solve any problem that was national in scope, irrespective of whether it was a <span style="font-style: italic">federal</span> problem.  A <span style="font-style: italic">federal</span> problem is one arising under the 18 specific enumerated powers given to the federal government under the Constitution.  A <span style="font-style: italic">national</span> problem is something that exists in New Jersey and California and Texas and Illinois.  But just because its national doesnt mean its federal and therefore can be addressed by the federal government.
<br />

<br />
.In terms of the governmental control of our lives, in terms of the percentage of our income that the government takes from us, in terms of the types and areas of human behavior we let the government regulate, we are infinitely less free.  And as Jefferson once said, it is in the natural order of things that the government should be greater and human liberty less.
<br />

<br />
Women have much more freedom.  African Americans have much more freedom.  Gays have much more freedom.  The discrimination that was rampant, and often caused by government, 40 or 50 or 60 years ago  theres been progress in those areas.  But the destruction of federalization, the centralization of power in Washington, the belief that Washington can regulate all aspects of our lives will, if not checked, lead us to a totalitarian form of government.  Freedom is the power and ability to obey your own free will and conscience rather than the free wills and consciences of others</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

These comments outline principles that touch upon many of the subjects discussed here, including currently active ones.
<br />

<br />
Judge Napolitano has a more elegant way with words than moi, but the bottom line is that the non-theists can ignore the G word, the positivists can ignore the natural law, the pragmatists can cite the Golden Rule (them that has the Gold, makes the Rules), but ultimately these are some of the basic principles this country was founded on, and comprise the basic rules that were agreed upon.  That oath, about supporting, defending, preserving the Constitution, its IN the Constitution.  This whole thing is a trust, and elected officials are to be trustees, not rulers.  Forgetting, or not knowing, all that leads you to servitude, and ignorant, complacent servitude at that.<br />
