				I remember watching a show on TV about the Mayan calendar and how it ends in 2012, predicting the end of the world in a sense. My sister read an excerpt from this book to me relating to this. I'm typing it out word for word, I want to know what others think about this, and if it is dismissible.
<br />
My hand is going to cramp up like crazy typing this heh.. hope it sparks some kind of discussion. Excuse any typo's please.
<br />

<br />
"<span style="font-weight: bold">The 3,000-Year-Old Time Map</span>
<br />

<br />
In 1995, an ancient instrument of prophecy was abruptly thrust into public view in a graphic and dramatic fashion. On November 4 of that year, an even occurred that the instrument had predicted with a precision far exceeding the possibility of chance or coincidence. The event was the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel, in the city of Tel Aviv. The assassination had been prophesied with such accuracy that the prime minister's name, the date of the assassination, the name of the city, and even the assassin's name, Amir, were no secret; each had been encoded into a document over three thousand years ago! 
<br />
                      
<br />
       The irony was that the document was not a rare manuscript held by a secret organization or privileged individual. The coded map of our future was the same map that has provided comfort and guidance for at least seventy-five generations and is held sacred today by several hundred million people worldwide. The map of time was discovered as a hidden code encrypted into the Bible at the time of its origin! Specifically, the code was found in the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, known as the Torah, the one version that is said to have been unaltered since it was given to man over three thousand years ago.
<br />

<br />
        Discovered by an Israeli mathematician, Dr. Eliyahu Rips, the key, known as the Bible Code, has been reviewed and validated by mathematicians in leading universities worldwide, as well as agencies specializing in encryption, such as the U.S. Department of Defense. For over two hundred years, scholars have suspected that biblical texts were more than an assemblage of words to be read in a strictly linear fashion. An eighteenth-century scholar, known as the Genius of Vilna, stated that "the rule is that all that was, is, and will be unto the end of time is included in the Torah, from the first word to the last word. And not merely in a general sense, but as to the details of everything that happened to him from the day of his birth until his end."
<br />

<br />
        The encrypted messages of our past and future may be studied by creating a matrix from the letters of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. Beginning with the first letter of the first word, all spaces and punctuation are removed until the last letter of the last word is reached, leaving a single sentence hundreds of characters in length. Using sophisticated search programs, the remaining matrix is examined for patterns and intersections of words. For example, in the book of Genesis, the word Torah is spelled out with sequences of fifty Hebrew characters between each of the letters of the world. The same sequence is found in the books that follow: Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The observation of this sequence by Rabbi H.M.D. Weissmandel in the 1940's became the key to unraveling the patterns of words encoded in the text.
<br />

<br />
        In his book of the same name, Michael Drosnin describes the precision and accuracy of the Bible Code in predicting past events. Circumstances as varied as the Kennedy Assassinations, the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy into Jupiter, the election of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, even the dates and location of the SCUD missile attack that the Iraqis launched against Israel during the 1990 Gulf War, are described with a level of detail that defies mathematical and statistical odds. The Bible Code offers specifics rather than broad generalities that may be open to interpretation. Drosnin details many such references. In the prediction of World War II, for example, the code spells out words such as "world war" and "final solution," accompanied by the names of leaders during the time: "Roosevelt," "Churchill," "Stalin," and "Hitler." Clearly stated are the countries involved in the conflict: "Germany," "England" "France," "Russia," Japan," and "United States." Even the words "atomic holocaust" and "1945," the year that the nuclear device was detonated over Hiroshima are disclosed, the only time those words appear in the bible.
<br />

<br />
        It was with the development of high-speed computers that the code embedded within the Hebrew Bible was finally decrypted. The new computers replaced tedious manual decoding with sophisticated search programs. Running against control groups of other texts and ten million test cased created by the computer, only the Bible was found to have the puzzlelike encryptions. Vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, names of countries, events, dates, times, and persons intersect with one another, providing a snapshot into the events of our past and the possibilities of our future. While the actual mechanism of such an extraordinary predictor is discussed in chapter seven, perhaps more relevant tot he question of prophecy is how this seemingly miraculous book of time related to our future. 
<br />

<br />
         In light of the Bible Code's accuracy for detailing our past, how accurate could the same matrix be in peering into a time yet to come? In his discussions with Drosnin, Dr. Rips suggests that the entire Bible Code had to be written all at once as a single act, rather than in a series of writings that took place over time. Such a statement infers with all possibilities of all futures are already in place. "We experience it like we experience a hologram--it looks different when we look at it from a new angle--but the image, of course, is prerecorded." The key to applying this ancient time code to the events of our future may be in viewing it through the eyes of a quantum physicist.
<br />

<br />
         In modern physics there is a tenet stating that it is impossible to know the "when" of something and the "where" of the same thing, at the same time. If you measure <span style="font-style: italic">where</span> something is, you lose information about how fast it is moving. If you measure how fast it is moving, then you cannot know with certainty where the something is. This key to the quantum world was developed by the physicist Werner Heisenburg, and is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
<br />

<br />
        Demonstrating the unpredictable behavior of nature in the quantum world, it may be that our sense of time follows precisely this kind of behavior. If so, the possibilities portrayed in the Bible Code may exist as just that, possibilities. The events stated, both past and future, are the end result of a sequence of conditions that may have begun days, or even hundreds of years, before the actual event plays out. Stated as we would a modern equation, <span style="font-style: italic">if</span> we choose a particular course of events, <span style="font-style: italic">then</span> we may expect to see such-and-such an outcome.
<br />
        
<br />
         Viewing any prediction tool as a lens into possibilities sheds new light on the role of prophecy in our lives. Coinciding with many biblical, Native American, and other prophecies for our future, the Bible Code alerts us as to a series of apocalyptic scenarios. Beginning in our near future, such occurrences as a third world war originating in the Middle East, catastrophic earthquakes, and the devastation of major population centers all appear as possibilities. The threat of a direct collision with a comet at the end of the twentieth century or early in the twenty-first appears to be one of the most immediate concerns.
<br />

<br />
         In 1992, astronomer Brian Marsden of Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced the return of the Swift-Tuttle comet, originally discovered in 1858. The precise day of the comet's rediscovery was encrypted in the Bible Code, along with it's predicted return 134 years later. The actual words "comet," "Swift-Tuttle," and the year of the comet's return, 2126, are clearly encoded in the text. Initially thought to be on a collision course with the earth at the time of its return, revised calculations now suggest that the comet will pass a safe distance away. Astronomers do, however, warn of a series of "near misses" leading up to the time of Swift-Tuttle in 2126, the first occurring in 2006. Intersecting the 2006 dateline in the Hebrew text are the words, "It's path struck their dwelling," accompanied with the phrase in an associated line, "Year predicted for the world."
<br />

<br />
       Following this warning are similar words leading up to the year 2010. The words "days of horror" cross this day with additional descriptions of "darkness," "gloom," and "comet." Perhaps the most unsettling sequence of words regarding our future is found above the year 2012. It is here, coincidentally in the same year that the Mayan calendar ends, that we see the words "Earth annihilated." This glimpse into an ancient possibility for our future provides an intriguing example of an element found throughout the Bible Code. Drosnin states that in the location where the date is encoded, a second passage, describing a very different outcome, is described. The words simply say, "It will be crumbled, driven out, I will tear it to pieces, 5772" (The Hebrew year for 2012).
<br />

<br />
        Similar to the theme of other prophecies, one one hand the Code appears to be saying to us that the year 2012 brings and end to life as we know it, while at the same time, in another location, the threat to the earth is destroyed. How can both outcomes be possible at the same time? Similar paradoxes show up from time to time throughout the Bible Code, particularly regarding outcomes of elections, political events, and warfare. In addition to the opportunity to model specific outcomes for our future based on choices of the present, perhaps the Bible Code is reminding us of something even more significant.
<br />

<br />
         In close proximity to specific outcomes, such as assassinations and the seeds of global warfare, four words appear again and again. Accompanying many of the gravest outcomes, the words pose a simple question: "Will you change it?" Reminiscent of the beliefs preserved for us by the ancient Essenes, the Bible Code also appears to suggest that we play a significant role in the outcome of events, even those already set into motion as possibilities. Apparently our role is so important that we may actually change the course of events! "Will you change it?" appears to be a direct question asked of those who would be certain to read the codemaker's message three thousand years after it was written. It is as if the writers knew that it would take technology of a high degree of sophistication to understand their code; as if we are being reminded that now, as we unravel the message of the codemakers, we are ready to participate in the unfolding of time and change the darkest possibilities of our future. How could the appearance of these other specifics appear today, in a manuscript that was encoded over three millennia ago? The Bible Code brings us back to the same question that the prophecies of others have led us to.
<br />

<br />

<br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold">A New Prophecy</span>
<br />

<br />
Of the many calculations and indigenous prophecies regarding our current time in history, 1998 appeared to mark the beginning of a window in time where we may expect to witness some of the greatest changes upon the earth. Precisely where within that window our lifetime places us is questionable, even to the prophets themselves. Edgar Cayce, for example, viewed 1998 as the last year of a cycle four decades long, in which we may expect "extraordinary planetary transformation" to begin. Nostradamus, on the other hand, placed 1998 at the <span style="font-style: italic">beginning</span> of a cycle of cataclysmic changes that he foresaw from that point to over three hundred years into our future. Beyond the discrepancies of exact dates, prophecies for our time almost universally reveal a common theme; they point to the birth of a new millennium as a time when we may expect to see great change upon the earth and within our bodies.
<br />

<br />
        Along with insights into our possible future, ancient seers reminded us of a great mystery. This mystery is particularly fascinating in light of the sophistication of calendars and the precision of systems tracking time. As accurate as the oral, written and prophetic traditions appear to be, <span style="font-style: italic">each stops short of detailing precisely how this great cycle of time will end and the next great cycle will being.</span> In addition to outlining possibilities for our future, those who have come before us acknowledged a potent force with the power to choose which possibility we experience. Largely overlooked in recent times, that force is the power of mass choice expressed as the science of mass prayer.
<br />

<br />
         In the language of their time, ancient prophets suggested that we have the ability to avert their visions of destruction in our future by consciously shifting the course of time in the present. It would appear as though many of the traditions of those before us had insight into a relationship between the actions of the people in this world and the outcome of the prophecies that they foresaw. That connection between our day-to-day routines and the outcome of prophecy has remained a mystery until the twentieth century. It is during this time, with the formulation of a new physics, that the possibilities of time, prophecy, miracles, and our role in the future of humankind have became clearer. We now know that predictions offer isolated possibilities only. We also know that we choose our possibilities with each breath and we take in each moment of each day."<br />

				Look, there is nothing there that one can't glean from common sense.
<br />

<br />
Humanity evolves. Evolution is change, chaos, pain, destruction, and rebirth... and then the cycle begins again. Therefore, at some point in the future, all hell will break loose. You don't need a prophecy to know that mankind is going to have a turbulent future the likes of which we can barely imagine. 
<br />

<br />
If you want to be worried about the future, worry about it because of the picture our current science can paint for you, rather than something in a moldy holy book. Those books have no value whatsoever beyond morality, and the time will come where they will have outlived their usefulness.
<br />

<br />
If you take your eyes off the ground and have the will to look at the horizon, <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0134.html?m=1" target="_blank" class="postlink">this is the kind of thing you may see.</a> Every bit as prophetic, beautiful and terrifying as anything in a holy book, but this has the benefit of hard science to back it up rather than flimsy, factless prophecy. Prophecy only has meaning if you consider time-travel to be possible.
<br />

<br />
Everything comes down to whether or not you believe humanity, at some point in the future, will get it right or not. If we can get it right just one time, it pays for the whole bloody affair.<br />

				Still reading that article.. the part about how someday it will be possible for us to download our brains into a databank and live on in a robot's body, was really interesting. Sounds like, if we reach that point without blowing the world up, we'll be creating our own evolution. Or that our mind brought upon this evolution.
<br />

<br />
It does seem to scare me though, being able to live forever in your mind.. yet kind of exhilarating. It would become almost impossible to completely die. It would make me wonder if there were really a heaven, and if their weren't, what about the people who just died and became nothingness. We'd possibly be cheating out the natural process of life.
<br />

<br />
I think it would be hard to hault our evolution of technology even with a nuclear war(althought it would undoubtedly slow down). Some of us would most likely survive, and since more and more data is becoming digital, it would be easier to keep the growth alive.
<br />

<br />
All of this talk of this type of technology really makes you think something like the Matrix is possible heh.. albeit much farther down the road when computers gain the ability to think for themselves. It really scares me...<br />

				Raviel, I can not believe you fell for that article you linked.  I read most of it, but what I did conclude ist that the guy wrote a huge amount of techno-babble @#%$.
<br />
He was, typical of somebody who does not know what they are talking about, just threw out a bunch of 'big' words to try to sound impressive.
<br />

<br />
First clue that the guy has no idea what he is talking about lies amongst the first paragraphs when he mentiones linear progress as opposed to exponential progress.
<br />
Okay, the problem is his entire arguement comes from the stand that people do believe in a linear progress.  People, though, do not believe in linear progression, we naturally believe in what he calls exponential progression.  In fact I think the typical Joe Blow consumer demands exponential advances in technology; people want computers twice as fast, memory twice as large, resolution twice as good.
<br />

<br />
My point, though, is that when the author makes the assumption about what society believes and that entire assumption is wrong, the rest of his conclusions, therefore, are wrong.
<br />
If you can not get the first step of a theory correct, then every following conclusion must incorrect.
<br />

<br />
He also assumes that Moore's Law is an actual scientific law; it is not.  It was just some guy making a very powerful statement that just happens to have been somewhat true.  There is not a signle shred of scientific evidence to support Moore's Law.
<br />
It is a very good guess that has worked out thus far.
<br />

<br />
The problem with this Kurzweil guy is that he tries to argue 'scientifically' against Moore's Law.  Again it is similar to what I mentioned earlier, if he can not even get the groundwork right his conclusions are nullified.
<br />

<br />
As it stands now, we do not even fully understand how memories are actually stored in the brain.  Sure, there are some good ideas on some matters; however, again we have no clue understanding of exactly how the brain works.
<br />

<br />
We need to understand how the brain works before we dare try to download it to a computer.
<br />

<br />
The first post in reponse to the guys article is a pretty good summary of what I think; and, more importantly, what the truth behind it is.
<br />

<br />
The author makes up calculations, makes up facts to support his opinion and yet manages to fail in mentioning a single concrete scientific source.
<br />

<br />
The guy may know a thing or two about computer technology, but is rather clueless in the fields of real science; physics, biology, chemistry.
<br />
He would be the guy I would lock in the back room to invent me a new computer monitor, not somebody  giving his opinions about the evolution of society.<br />

				The linked article uses facts to back up everything it references, and was written by a man with 11 PhDs, two bestselling science books, and 9 successful multimillion dollar business ventures who is considered to be the number one scientist of all time in the field of artificial intelligence. His mantle is crowded with technical awards of nobel-prize caliber. I'm a bit reluctant to label someone with those qualifications a crackpot. Especially when what he's saying is so bloody obvious in the first place. Feel free to refute his credentials if you want, but I'm not that arrogant. 
<br />

<br />
As for Moore's law, it'll last about ten seconds past the first multi-layer processor - that is, a processor that is built inside a 3D cube using 3D designs instead of a 2D grid. That'll happen right about the time when they get down to molecule-sized microprocessors as the standard, which IBM has already built and tested successfully. When that happens, Moore's law fails because your computing power is now going up by cubes instead of squares. Moore's law also rather ignores quantum computing, which throw some amazing curve balls into the mix because it does so many types of math almost instantly in ways classical computers couldn't duplicate without decades of calculation. The addition of a quantum-computing unit to conventional processors essentially breaks all computer paradigms. Moore's law is a <span style="font-style: italic">highly</span> conservative estimate of computing power, that was basically as you say, a lucky guess, and we are well past its relevance... but the difference is that we're going to exceed its predictions, not succumb to them.
<br />

<br />
Joe blow doesn't know the difference between a linear and exponential curve, and wouldn't recognize one if it kicked him down a flight of stairs. All he cares about is that tomorrows toys are faster / better / cheaper than today's toys. Fifty years ago we didn't have computers, and right now we'd be useless without them. Saying we won't ever decode the brain is like saying we'd never have color television. Of course we will, it's just a question of when, and how. We just decoded the entire human genome, something considered impossible 10 years ago. Heck, Monday was the first ever private space flight. Things are looking up.
<br />

<br />
The only thing I take issue with in the article is the timeline. I think he's off by a hundred years at least. He's overlooking the fact that the exponential growth is only affecting developed areas of the world, as least for the time being. There are a number of restraining factors he is not taking into account. His conclusions still seems very sound.<br />

				Rav, i havn't had a good chance to sit down and read the whole thing. However, so far I'm inclined to agree with Xianin. The guy tries to say that technological evolution is a natural extension of biological evolution. 
<br />

<br />
Taking that standpoint, you could say that with a runaway positive feedback loop (human brain evolution, Evolutionary Arms races, ect) you would have an exponential growth of a particular trait. However, there are physical limitations to how far any particular trait can advance. 
<br />

<br />
For example, human brain size. Human brain size increased rapidly between generations. Cause? Unknown although there are a few very good theories to date. Why did the average population brain size stop growing between generations? Because the birth path between the pelvis was too small to accommodate a larger brain.
<br />

<br />
For example, cheetah running speed. Cheetahs are fast animals; they gained their speed rapidly over the course of a few years (relatively speaking). However, we have not seen a speed increase in cheetahs in a few hundred thousand years. Why? The physics to increase the speed of a cheetah would have too high of an energy cost is probably not worth it.
<br />

<br />
Instead of these particular traits advancing further at a huge cost relative to the gains, you might have another trait advance such as camouflage so that the cheetah would not have to run quite as fast.
<br />

<br />
The point I am trying to hit on here, involves the physical limitations of technology. We may be on the exponential growth portion of the technology evolution graph~ however, tomorrow we might hit a ceiling of advancement. We could branch out, and improve our other processes, but whatever portions of technology that hit the ceiling will be at a standstill, where improving the design will not give a significant improvement compared to the cost. In a capitalistic society, cost is everything.
<br />

<br />
I also like how this guy references average life expectancy. However, what he does not include is that the life expectancy of a human is no longer improving. We have reached the human limitation of life expectancy, and once again, any improvement to technology to try to increase the life expectancy would be too costly to show such a small gain. Instead, we should focus on technology that improves the quality of life during those years. 
<br />

<br />
I need to finish reading this and I will probably comment later, if and when I have time.<br />

				Eleven honorary degrees.  Still, eleven more than I have, however that is a far, far cry from actually earning eleven degrees.
<br />

<br />
The guy totally comes off as the same type of person in the 1950s who said we would be living on the moon and have flying cars.
<br />

<br />
All of his charts and graphs are essentially meaningless.  Not meaningless in the sense that they do not convey information, but meaningless in that are not revolutionary in some sense.  *gasp* He is telling us that GDP has been increasing!!!!  That new technology has seen an increase in patents!!!
<br />
Resolution of scientific instruments has increased!!!  Life expectency is on the rise!!!
<br />

<br />
OMG, give this guy another honorary PhD for his stunning insight!
<br />

<br />
Half of his thoughts are common sense and known things, but he throws in some impressive looking charts and graphs that somehow fool people into thinking he is revolutionary.
<br />

<br />
The second half of his thoughts are fanciful, at best.  I do agree that much of the stuff he is saying is plausible, but the timeline is way off.
<br />

<br />
Raviel, as to your remarks about stuff like cracking the human genome, they have been working on that for well over ten years  Heck, I bet one of the first things that Watson and Crick (the 'discoverers' of DNA) was that it needs to be decoded and that was a bit over 50 years ago.
<br />

<br />
Also, I think he is taking his exponential growth too linerarly, if that makes sense.  I think he is depending on the linear continuation of the exponential increase.  History, though, shows us that is not always the case.  Fall of the Roman Empire, the dark ages, repressive Catholic church, revitilization of the rennaisance, persecution of new thinkers (Gailelo), industrial revolution, word wars, etcetera.
<br />

<br />
My point is that I think the actual historical evidence shows us that there is exponential growth, then it stagnates then we hit another moment of exponential growth; rinse and repeat.
<br />

<br />
Raviel to touch on what you mentioned, a perfect example in the modern world are these undeveloped countries that we have.  We are going to evolve as a species, but eventually everybody in the world will be held back due to the less developed parts of the world; growth will stagnate.  When those countries/civilizations get 'caught up' then we again will evolve.
<br />

<br />
Also I feel that you do not give the everday Joe Blow enough credit.  Like it or not, the fact is that masses rule the world:  masses = joe blow.  There are, obviously, the thinkers and leaders but they are only as good as the Joe Blows.
<br />
Maybe Joe Blow does not know the math behind a linear curve or an exponential curve or a cubic one.  However you draw them out, then I bet just about anybody can look at that and tell you what is going on.
<br />
You do not need to know the quadratic calculation thing to interpet what you see.<br />

				And don't forget X~ that growth increases rapidly until you approach the saturation point. Then your growth slows down, and finally comes to a standstill and finally declines.

<br />
You see this kind of growth chart in populations, technology, evolution, power increase, speed, ect.
<br />

<br />
So what? We may be nearing the apex of technological growth. You might see decline in the next 20 years instead of continual growth!

				I just thought of some other stuff that I am going to throw out in the open.
<br />

<br />
First, something I have noticed in both 'real life' and moreso on the internet is that computer technology type people understand so very little about, what I like to call, the real sciences; biology, chemistry, geology, physics, etc.  On the other hand most scientists have no problem using and developing technology.
<br />

<br />
I think Kurzweil is a perfect, if extreme, example.  I do not disparage or othewise wish to nullify any of his achievements in the field of computer related technology.  However, at least in that article, has very little understanding of biological evolution.  He does, though, do a good job of throwing out some anatomy words to sounds impressive.  However, I can upen up my Biology 101 textbook from college and throw out a bunch of cool sounding words too.
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">The brain is not one huge "tabula rasa" (i.e., undifferentiated blank slate), but rather an intricate and intertwined collection of hundreds of specialized regions.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
Whoa, deep.  So, our brains have different regions?  Wow, glad he cleared that up for us.
<br />

<br />
Stylx made a few good points, which in a way scares me.
<br />
Biological evolution and technical evolution are two entirely different beasts.
<br />

<br />
I fall into a crowd of people who believe that human technology has essentially nullified any sort of biological evolution that has taken place.  Biological evolution is going to, essentialy, cease to be as there is an increase in technology.
<br />
I gotta figure out if there is a term for people that think like that.
<br />

<br />
Anyhow, due to technology we have instances were people are basically living when they should be dying and giving birth when they should be sterile.
<br />
It is kind of harsh to say, but the fact is if people are not able to breed then they probably should not be breeding.  If a person is medically unable to live past the age of two, then evolutionary speaking, they should not be living.
<br />
However, again, technology has made it so that these people are living and spreading their genetic material into society.  We are basically contaminating our own DNA; man, I sound like Hitler now.
<br />

<br />
We as a species have no major need or reason to develop some leap in evolution.  
<br />

<br />
In order to understand my point, I am going to backtrack and mention something about biological evolution.
<br />
Evolution is easily misunderstood by most and I think not because it is too complicated, but because it is simple; parsimonious is the word that scientists love to throw around.
<br />
Evolution ulitimately would lead to an incrase in fitness.  Fitness is not really defined as being stronger, faster, and smarter, but rather the ability to have more viable offspring.  If you are faster and stronger than I am, it does you no good if you can not breed.
<br />
In most cases, though, the faster and stronger animal does have more viable offspring.  
<br />
<a href="http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/E/Evolution.html#Fitness" target="_blank" class="postlink">HERE</a> is something I googled up that may make sense.  I didn't read all of it, but the fitness portion is what I did read.
<br />

<br />
So, biological evolution is basically a chance mutation that increases fitness and therefore gets passed on into the population.
<br />

<br />
Getting back to my point about technology and evolution, the chance of a human evolutionary change actually affecting our species is about null.  Not completely true, however technology nullifies any positive impact that a change could have.
<br />

<br />
For example maybe somebody develops a mutation that makes them more heat tolerant.  Okay, that is cool for them, but in the age of sunscreen, indoor air conditioning and medical prevention the positive impact of that mutation is basically meaningless.
<br />

<br />
I would like to see some more studies about reverse engineering the brain, as Kurzweil mentions.  However, I think in a typicial computer-type person way, he fails to tkae notice that the brain is not some stand alone organ.  In the technology world you can increase HDD space, RAM, video and whatever else all as stand alone advnaces.  Sure everything eventually needs to take a leap forward, but I can buy a bigger HDD right now without upgrading my entire computer.
<br />
You can not, though, rebuild the brain via reverse engineering in the same fashion.  Simple and easy explanation is the hormone regulation that happens in the body.  Stuff enters and leaves the brain (so to speak) so the brain is not neccesarily isolated.
<br />

<br />
I think the guy does have some ideas for a killer sci-fi series.<br />
