<font class="print-normal">This is one story, a true story, that must be prefixed with stating quite simply,  &quot;I cannot believe this happened nor can anyone quite yet grasp what was accomplished&quot;... and it was all done by a united Everquest server community- Luclin. This is a long and quite involved story, but I'm going to try to keep it as short as possible.<br>
<br>
(Click title for rest of article)<br />
There once were 3 entities, an Everquest player and business person from Prexus server named <b>Twygg</b>, a business man who runs www.mysupersales.com named <b>Yantis</b>, and the Luclin server community. A long time ago Twygg had created several Everquest server boards and websites, including Luclin's and the old <a href="http://www.luclin.com">Luclin.com</a> website. These were great utilities and meeting places for the server communities, but unfortunately that was not the drive behind their creation, which was in reality money and greed. Money and greed attract those who want it, and thus how Yantis and Twygg ended up in business together. Yantis has bought up many EQ sites, including Monkley-Business. These sites have become hosts for ads to his e-bay like business which violates Sony's EULA and gets them removed from Sony's <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/links.jsp">link list</a> at <a href="http://www.everquest.com">Everquest.com</a>.<br>
<br>
You see, Twygg attempted to <i>SELL</i> our community to Yantis. A board with nearly 7000 registered users hundreds of which troll each week makes for a fantastic billboard to advertise one's business, anyone could see this and the fact it could make for a great business oportunity- attracting more and more customers. What Twygg neglected to explain to Yantis was what happened last time Twygg insisted on having ads up on our boards, and even more importantly what happened when Twygg flipped and made Luclin.com a wallpaper of UGO ads. Because noone owns the Luclin community (the people) and given the overwhelming voice that several hundred people gave to Twygg within a day or two, Twygg ended up giving up and leaving the boards saying he'd never come back... and Luclin.com was forced to shut down when some Luclin community members contacted UGO about Twygg's massive abuse of their ad view/click policy.<br>
<br>
So that's how the history of round one with Twygg went. Luclin won. We took our boards back, took down the ads all over them, put up links to our calendar and the awesome database site that Moslad runs for us for FREE (<a href="http://www.luclin.org">Luclin.org</a>), and a few who missed the old days of having news on Luclin.com created this very site (<a href="http://www.eqluclin.com">EqLuclin.com</a>). Everything was right with the world, until a few days ago (1/18/2003) when <a href="http://pub106.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=9466.topic">this post</a> appeared on our old boards. The Luclin community had one oversight- Twygg still had EZop status on that EZboard when he left, meaning, he owned the supreme admin rights to that board.<br>
<br>
Thus began the appearance of the www.mysupersales.com ads at the top of forums, and the utter outrage of the Luclin community in being undermined and sold out was voiced, and voiced loudly. Vallorious, a Luclin community member who was the very same person who played a part in the EqLuclin.com puzzle when he purchased the domain name for us, had the foresight to create an <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/beqluclin">eqluclin EZboard</a> all that time ago, just in case something like this happened... and I know the entire community is glad he did. Many of us moved over to that board and prepared for the worst, while also on the home front we had talks with Yantis trying to stop it. We also had had a <a href="http://beta.ezboard.com/fezboardfrm40.showMessage?topicID=17569.topic">question into EZboard</a> inquiring on if the EZop status could be changed so that the community could be OWNED by someone in the community, but that wasn't an option it seemed. When folks started giving up and deciding to switch boards a few of them posted links to the new board on the old one, and that's when the line was finally drawn. Yantis was censoring and banning long time and loyal members of our community, something he said at the beginning that he wouldn't do. He also sent me (Bicrius) an e-mail saying that what people were doing on the boards was unacceptable and that I must do something about it. You can find <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/feqluclinfrm1.showMessage?topicID=35.topic">my response to him here</a> after I recieved that e-mail. Scroll down and see how I reacted after I found out that he banned Cayleu, a cleric known by all clerics on our server as she used to keep the Ragefire list. Thus...<br>
<br>
That was the final straw. We'd been sold out. We were being used for advertising space. We were being forced to move. And to top it off, we were being told what to do? <b>Someone who doesn't own us has got to be extremely dumb to attempt this and even BUY something in the first place that noone can OWN.</b> The line had been crossed, and Luclin went to war. Hundreds of community members <a href="http://webster.ij.net/~eop/flames/supremeownage_3.jpg">spammed the old boards</a> with links to the new one, links were made to class sites and other server sites alerting them of what was going on, and all 650ish registered EqLuclin members were notified.<br>
<br>
The results? <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/feqluclinfrm1.showMessage?topicID=60.topic">I direct you here</a>. Twygg tried to screw the Luclin community once, and failed. Twygg succeeded in screwing Yantis though. He sold Yantis something that wasn't his, and neglected to inform him of what our community did last time. Yantis then in trying to protect his investment picked a fight that would be impossibe for ANYONE to win. He had no chance, what so ever. In fact, Twygg and Yantis's folley is so laughable, that, well, if you click any link in this post, <a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/feqluclinfrm12.showMessage?topicID=12.topic">you MUST click this one</a> (and browse through a few of the others while you're there).<br>
<br>
Luclin has a new messageboard home. We're as united as ever. We will never sell out to anyone. We are a community. We play Everquest, and we love being on the Luclin server, and for good reason. This is our community. The only thing we lost is a tiny bit of history on our old boards, but we've gained our freedom and won the war... together.<br>
<br>
Just a note: Prexus fought the same war we did, and it looks as though <a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bprexus81531">they may have won as well</a>. And I KNOW that <a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org/">The Safehouse</a> shut down Yantis as well in the past. Great work all!<br>
<br>
... and probably the worst part of this all? In a violent outlash, Twygg deleted the contents of Luclin's &quot;Past Favorites&quot; forum, and did the same to Prexus and their equivalent forum. That was truely malicious and a shame.<br>
