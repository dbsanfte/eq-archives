				Healthcare involves peoples production.  It is never a right to take from another person by force.  It is never Right to take from another person by force.
<br />

<br />
It is a shame that society is unable to find a way of keeping the poor at least moderately able to get healthcare in an emergency.
<br />

<br />
Oh! Wait they already can.
<br />

<br />
Anyone have anumber for people that cannot get emergency healthcare?  What is the percent uninsured for a health plan?  The remainder the ones not poor enough for government charity, and not wealthy enough for health insurance... what is it that is blocking their economic access?  Where is the disparity in the market?
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
I would want to know what the plan was.  I cannot see it happening through government except to add yet another layer of drain on the economy of healthcare with more bureaucrats.  If healthcare is universally available by edict of law then by nature of the need for control over that which one is responsible, the ONLY healthcare that will be available will be through the government.
<br />

<br />
What we are talking about is making doctors the employees of the state.  If you want the guy operating on you to have the same work ethic as a California Department of Motor Vehicles worker, then you should want to socialize medicine.
<br />

<br />
If you are afraid of not being able to get insurance and therefore unable to get regular medical care.  That is a legitimate problem.  There is a monopoly on healthcare that doctors should never have allowed to happen to their field in the first place.
<br />

<br />
To socialize healthcare would only to make the insurance onus darker and more powerful with guns for collections and agencies free from doing wrong by virtue that the governemnt can do no wrong (the law says so, ever try to sue the government?) making the live and die decisions.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
I want to remain free to pick my doctors without the government interfering.  To be free I don't want an insurance system running a monopoly on healthcare.  Currently it is nearly impossible to get healthcare outside of an insurance portal for any working man.
<br />

<br />
Monopolies are anti-freedom and anti-market.  They happen when an industry is allowed to collude to the point that a consortium has taken complete steering control of a market.  It does not have to be one company to be a monopoly, it can be one government or a group of companies working on a common formula.
<br />

<br />
Before I voted to restrict the rights of the people in choice of health plan I would examine the stranglehold on the market that has produced the crisis.  Neither doctors nor patients like the way things are now.  Insurance companies are loving it though they theatrically groan woth the rest of us and then wink their way back to the bank.
<br />

<br />
Narrowing the market and arming the puppetteers with the power of arrest and the unredressible decision over treatment and life or death does not seem to me to be the right direction for the wants of the public nor for what doctors would prefer.<br />

				Maybe a little off-topic, but the insurance company we use at work now is awful.
<br />

<br />
Right now, when I go to the doctor, I pay a $15 co-pay.  Ins. company gets a bill, they determine if they can make me pay up part of a deductible.  So far, I've been lucky with this, but I know many others who haven't been.
<br />

<br />
Then I get to play roulette at the pharmacy.  Last time I went, the doctor had prescribed 6 pills to me.  The pharmacist says the insurance company will only cover 1, and send me on my way.  I call the insurance company about it, they create a "pre-authorization" case.  They tell me I have to contact my doctor (this ain't happening) and have him call them to answer some "medical questions".  I tried a few times to reach him, didn't succeed for a few days, called them back.  They begin attempts to contact him, I go on vacation, and on the last week of a 3 week vacation, my prescription is approved.  Great, right?  Nope, they only approved 5 of the pills!  These pills are $25 each.  I paid a $25 copay for the 5 pills, and another $15 copay for another prescription given to me at the same time.  So, now I'm at 3 weeks of hassle + $55 ($80 if I actual get the last pill I'm supposed to have).  This might not seem like a lot to some people, but I'm not rich.  I pay nearly $300 per month for this health insurance plan.
<br />

<br />
On top of this, they sent us a letter 2 months AFTER we had already signed up for them with the company, telling us we have to send into a mail-in pharmacy that THEY own for any drugs we get more than 3 refills on per year, claiming it will save us money as well (up to 50%!).  Turns out they are more expensive than a local walk-in pharmacy according to 3 people I work with who take recurring medications.
<br />

<br />
It has gotten to the point that if I feel bad, I wait at least a month before going to the doctor.  Health insurance has gotten out of hand.  I'd almost be better off to just pay Blue Cross on my own.<br />

				.... there's a monopoly on health care?
<br />

<br />
*boggle*
<br />

<br />
Sometimes you amaze me with the crap you spout.  There are hundreds of healthcare insurance providers out there.  Beyond that, you do not have to have insurance to get health care.  You just have to have cash.
<br />

<br />
Even beside that point, doctors didn't "allow" anything to happen regarding insurance.  They aren't exactly given the option to dictate coverage policies or the rules that health care insurance providers choose to use.  It was a simple progression:  insurance companies offered plans.  Insurance companies pay the doctors for seeing patients using their plans.  Doctors can either accept the health care, or rely solely on cash patients.  Given that for most people it costs less in the long run to just have the insurance, and therefore they're going to have it, trying to rely solely on cash patients is a losing proposition.
<br />

<br />
There's no monopoly involved there, nor is there some choice doctors made to allow health care to happen.  I mean sure, they *could* have all refused, but since that would have been stupid for all concerned, they didn't.
<br />

<br />
As far as health care being a right.... no, I don't think it is, really.  Definitely falls into the realm of privilege, IMO.  If it was a right, no one would ever have to pay doctors or other health care providers, and that's a bit silly.

				What I find curious is that if a private company does it, it is called <span style="font-style: italic">insurance</span>, but if a government does it, it gets called <span style="font-style: italic">socialized medicine</span>. No government run healthcare plan can be worse than existing HMOs. Especially with laws being passed to prevent patients from sueing the HMOs for malpractice/conspiracy/neglect.
<br />

<br />
If a private company adds layers of bureaucratic nonsense to keep patients from getting healthcare, it gets called <span style="font-style: italic">maximizing shareholder value</span>, but if a government does it, it gets called <span style="font-style: italic">bureaucratic nonsense</span>. 
<br />

<br />
I used to work for a company that did EDI for the healthcare industry. Most insurance companies have what is called a <span style="font-style: italic">formulary</span> which is the medicine they will pay for, the ones they will not pay for, and the substitutions that they demand. In many cases, a formulary is benign: use generics where possible. In some, it is some faceless bureaucrat/businessman who makes healthcare decisions without a medical degree or any accountability. Another project that company was working on was an automated system to link doctors and insurers for something called <span style="font-style: italic">eligibility</span>, in layman's terms: is patientX covered by insurance for this visit? 
<br />

<br />
Insurance companies decide what they are willing to pay doctors, and it is illegal for the doctors to get together to decide whether to accept the bones they are being tossed or not. If 2 or more doctors reject an insurance company's offer, they get investigated for conspiracy.
<br />

<br />
Number of US workers without access to ANY healthcare insurance at all: 44,000,000. This does not include the number who decline, cannot afford, or do not qualify for a plan thru the office. I have had 12 weeks of healthcare coverage in the last 3 years.<br />

I've gotten outside healthcare insurance before, without my employers help.  It was expensive, granted, but it came in very useful and it was a "fair" policy, which is to say they covered what they said they'd cover without arguing with me about it.  It cost me 110$ a month, so like I said, pretty expensive.
<br />

<br />
That being said, a lot of people who CAN afford insurance CHOSE not to afford it.  The heirarchy of needs in America has changed dramatically in the last 20 years.  It's funny as hell to me really.  People out there without health insurnace...but they have computers, internet service/broadband service, cable TV, cell phones...they put these luxaries over health care.  No sympathy from me.<br />

<br />
Doctors and nurses, unfortunately, are pawns in today's healthcare system; damned if they do, damned if they don't.  As was mentioned previously if they don't want to mess with insurance then they can attempt to accept only cash paying clients, but that will probably not work in the long haul, with the exception of surgeons specializing in cosmetic surgeries which are usually not covered under insurance (e.g. plastic surgeons).
<br />

<br />
While I do not think the current healthcare system is perfect in any way, I would prefer the system we have now to a 100% government run system a la Canada.

That is essentially the definition of socialism; having the government run things.  The government running an industry totally negates any free market policies.  You probably would not want the government in charge of designing and building your automobile, it is better to have companies competing for you, the customer.

The proof lies in the problems with Canadian healthcare.  The proof lies with healthcare in UK.
<br />
It is basically a fact that our system, while not perfect, is better than a government run healthcare plan.

I have not heard of a single law that prevents a person from suing.  There are laws being passed, though, that caps the payouts for certain procedures.  So if you have a disappriopiate amount of pain getting a wisdom tooth pulled, you still can sue but it will not be for tens of millions of dollars.
<br />
Do you want people to file frivilous @#%$ lawsuits so the cost of healthcare can go higher???
<br />
I am all for people having the option to sue when they deserve but come on lets face the facts there are a whole lot of unneccesary claims being filed and that cost is being passed to the consumer; us.
<br />

<br />
I have been with United Healthcare for about four years now.  Luckily I have not had any massive medical problems, but for the few minor ones I have had nothing but good experiences with them.
<br />
In the pursuit of a job in today's market a major factor is healthcare.  No longer is it just salary and the work schedule, but now people need to find the company that has good healthcare.  If your employer has crappy health plans, such as Cobee's from the sound of it, then you need to either get another job that has a better plan or go outside the system like Balth said.
<br />
It sucks, but you have the choice and the ability to do so.  It is a free market and I am not sure I want the government moving in and monoplizing it.<br />

That'd be me. I basically lost all of the last 18 calender months due to a medical condition which required (moderate) surgery. I haven't had the courage to add up what the final total was to me, but it is in excess of $12,000.
<br />

<br />
Don't have enough for the outlandish cost of health insurance, and too much personal solvency to get any kind of assistance from any government body, so it was all out of pocket.
<br />

<br />
Half of the problem is the flat-out disgusting cost of healthcare. Half an hour with a nurse practitioner whose sole duty was accomplished by 2 minutes of asking about symptoms, a quick feel of the lymph nodes in my neck, and writing out an order for a blood draw...that cost me $100. The blood draw/lab work, and the consult with the doctor with the final results were all extra.
<br />

<br />
Fortunately, the resulting daily medication I need to take (for the rest of my life) is only $30 for a 2 month bottle...

Monthly health insurance would be more than I spend for internet access, phone, gasoline, electricity, cable, and auto insurance put together. You could almost add in my entire food budget too, but that would push it over. I spend less money than anyone I know. Worked out pretty well, until genetics from my mother's side caught up with me. Looking at it in retrospect, if I'd been paying for health insurance for the last 10 years that I didn't need it, I probably wouldn't even have saved money over what it cost me when I did need it.<br />

<br />

<br />
what I see is everyone in hte US on the msot restritive HMO plan you can possibly imagine... cuz that is hte only way you're gonna be able to pay for it... tired down wth so many cost containment policies, that nothing can be done.
<br />

<br />
healcare needs to remain a private business ***neeeds too**
<br />

<br />
because that way it remains a point of service. That means people will graviate toward a plan and company that is best for them.
<br />

<br />
the biggest drain on healthcare is not doctors, labs, surgeries.. its mainatence medications... these are drugs that peopel need to take forever... aka never stop taking, thus the company must always pay... that burden of cost will only go up.
<br />

<br />
those drug commercials for viagra, all thse stomach acid drgus (which are really expensive!) haev had a pretty big impact on meds.. the company i work for jsut implimented a cost conatinment measure that forces a person to pay the difference bebyond a cetain amount. akakif you take close to hte lowest dosing and strength, you won;t get hit. But once you go over, you're hit with the difference.
<br />

<br />
Also remember that sicne healthcare is a service, the mroe you pay, the more you can do and the easier you can do it. I now it sounds bad, but like poppa said, it's still the best in hte world.<br />

				For those who want government medical care that is "free" or without you making payments per visit and using the current system, ask anyone in the military how they like there healthcare.  Thats the quality of service you would recieve if the government took over health care.  For someone like me, healthy requiring no medication just the twice annual dental cleaning and annual physical the system is fine.  But for anyone out there who has real medical problems beware, the quality of service you recieve is minimal at best.  You pay a flat rate out of taxes and so weather or not the doctor takes the extra time to do that extra test to find the source of the problem.  He gets paid his salary.

				I wish I would have though of posting about the military medicine thing.  I remember when I was stationed here in DC in 99 or 00 that they army was having a big problem keeping intel people (me) in the army.  The reason was, in DC, we were quite often working alongside contractors doing the same thing we were for who were making three, four or five times as much money as we were.  A lot of these contractors were also ex-military and would talk to us about how easy it was to get these cushy contractor jobs.
<br />

<br />
So the army sent us these cost breakdowns about how much money we actually made, after figuring in the cost of the money we got for seperate rations,* housing and health care.  I thought it was funny as hell, because the army was trying to convince me that my pay check, which added up to about 22,000 dollars per year, was actually closer to 50,000/year.  Sure, my housing was free....as long as I chose to live in a barracks along with 400 other people and didn't mind sharing a bathroom with 4 functioning showers with a wing of 25 people.  
<br />

<br />
But the funniest part was health care.  Like many people in the military, I think military health care is a joke.  The entire system is based on doing the minimum it can to get you out of the office.  The first medication prescribed, just about every time, for just about every illness, is....Motrin.  No matter what your symptoms, the first thing they're going to start you with is Motrin.  I can honestly say that I was not a sicky, and only went to sick call if I was legitimately sick.  Over five years, I probably still have somewhere on the order of 300-400 motrin tablets sitting around.  I wonder what it's shelf life is?
<br />

<br />
Anyway, while I was down in Tampa on my recall this past year, I developed a kidney stone...my third.  I knew is soon as it happened and made an appointment with the doctor.  For those who haven't had the kidney stone experience, you do fun things like @#%$ blood, have nearly constant low grade pain, with the occasional bout of blinding, mind blowing pain (they say it's as close as a male can come to experiencing childbirth), that generally puts you in the ER for morphine IV's for 12-24 hous.
<br />

<br />
Generally a kidney stone will pass naturally after 3-4 weeks.  If it doesn't, it's probably time for surgery.  In my case however, it took the military doctor FOUR MONTHS before they would even send me to see a urologist.  As soon as the urologist got the X-rays back, his comments were "why the hell did you wait this long!?!"  They did surgery 2 weeks later.  The bottom line though was that the army waited four months before they sent me to have an expensive procedure...while I spent that 4 months in pain and made half a dozen visits to the ER.
<br />

<br />
Want more?  A co-worker of mine at my last job is married to a retired military man, which means they get military health-care for free for life (and so do their children).  So their oldest kid (mid-teens) goes to the doc because his ab's are hurting.  The doctor pokes him a few times, chalks it up to a torn or strained muscle, proscribes (you guessed it) Motrin, and sends him on his way.  Well, three months later the kid is still having pain.  Back to the doctor.  Same thing...just a muscle strain, not healing fast, no big deal...heres your Motrin and a muscle relaxer.  I don't know about ya'll, but when I was a teen, I healed nearly instantly, I'd strain a muscle and be fine a week later.  Anyway, two months after the last visit, mom has to pick up the kid from school because he is doubled over in pain...he can hardly move, so they go to the ER.  They do an X-ray and find a softball sized cancerous mass in his abdomen.  Luckily, he lived....after 18 months of chemo and radiation therapy.
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying this is always the case in the military, but they have a measure of protetion that civilian doctors dont have against malpractice suits, especially from activy duty military members, so the threat to them is less than a civilian doctor.  Yes, misdiagnosis happens in the civilian world as well...but it seems particularly common in the military.
<br />

<br />
Thats not the health care I want as a civilian.<br />
