				Hey guys, I don't normally post on these boards, especially the debates and rants sections cause I hate the flaming.  This post caught my eye though and I have to speak my own mind about this subject. 
<br />
   I am currently deployed to a small country called Qatar of the tip of Saudi Arabia.  I have been over here for just under 3 months now and I have to say it has opened my eyes to many things.  Never once did I think that this war was all about the oil, and regardless of the politics behind it I think my military brothers and sisters have accomplished great things for the people of the Middle East.  
<br />
   Aludeid AB, Qatar is a main hub of transportation for supplies, troops, and other things needed to support the war that most people only see from their living room.  People sit in their comfortable recliners and drink pure water on tap with all the food they want watching TV, complaining that we are over here wasting their money.  Our efforts here are not pointless and to all who think they are, you are sadly mistaken.  Upon my arrival here at Qatar, just before the capture of Saddam, we were briefed that the Terrorist threat in this region is VERY high.  Sure enough, not two months later, 
<br />
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/02/13/qatar.chechen/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/02/13/qatar.chechen/index.html</a>
<br />
our base was dramatically placed in Charlie and all off-base travel was suspended.  If you click the link you'll see why, but basically there was an attack outside Doha.  Just yesterday I had the opportunity to go downtown and see the city and outskirts of Doha for myself.  I met an Iraqi family eating lunch that had just moved to Qatar and found work, purchasing their first family car and house.  This family was actually set better financially than the average I gather.  I get to eat lunch daily with the army and marine forces that are just getting a chance to come home and see their family for the first time since the Iraqi invasion.  Many of these forces as well as a countless number of brits, tell me what it's like in Baghdad.  I am just a simple airman in the USAF, quite removed from anything you could label as danger.   These guys are heroes.  I would say that not one of these men went against their will to go fight in Iraq.  Sure in the military if you don't like something, too bad; but every one of these troops I would venture to say believe that what this country is doing over here is the morally right thing.  I see pictures of Iraqi children going to school unafraid to walk through the streets, I see mothers allowed to stand up and become something now.  I see all of the restrictions placed upon this country slowly being lifted, as this truly is operation Iraqi freedom.  Sit in you’re @#%$ recliner and tarnish the reputations of those who gave their lives for a greater cause, it’s your right.  Question all you want the motive of our president and the forces of the United States.  Then think of all the simple freedoms that you daily take for granted.  Then, imagine a world where none of these freedoms exist, and you have no rights.  Next, thank God (if you even believe) that he allows you to be a part of a nation where you don't have to live life like that.  Nobody's life is perfect, and from first hand experience its one thing to see it on CNN, its totally different once you see it for yourself.  God bless you all and take to heart the sacrifices that these people make to allow us all the freedoms we have.

				And in Elbrichs posts again we see clearly illustrated the fault in his logical chain.  Not only in his own words but in teh words of his supporting evidence as well.
<br />

<br />
You posted an Iraqis views of of the occupation as evidence that Iraqis are unhappy.  Yet when you read it, you find that the person really has to reach for displeasure and make some fundamental emotional leaps of reason to base their position.
<br />

<br />
Throughout their piont by point dissection of the list of good things, this person is unable to fault the US though they try to allude to resposnibility they shy away in their own writing mid paragraph and say things like, "but this is not the fault of the US."
<br />

<br />
The strongest of their arguements against the US is this:

In fact it is so slow that we are not expecting things to get back to normal in months to come.

<br />

<br />
To me this belies the person having expectations that are way outside the bounds of reality or rational thought.  The government was deposed by military force.  It was a revolution and it was swift.  Things WILL NOT get better in Iraq "fast" when it comes to matters of infrastructure.  Even slower will be the adoption of a non-tyrranical form of government.  The mindset in Iraq has long been programmed to accept that sort of rule.  There will be some hard lessons coming in the future for Iraqis. That is the PRICE OF FREEDOM... It is called RESPONSIBILITY and it is a major pain in the a.ss.
<br />

<br />
This Iraqi you post as evidence is still in a denial phase.  They want Iraq to prosper, and they want  it to be sovereign.  The want it to happen overnight without having to work towards it happening. They want to have their cake and to eat it too.
<br />

You sir, are also in a denail phase.

<br />

<br />
I do not question their validity. None of them.  They are all based on a nations right to defend itself from a threat.  The inclusion of principles that protect the interests of Iraqi people are gifts that the Iraqi People would not have thought twice about had the roles been reversed.  I have centuries of evidence to back that statement up.
<br />

<br />
To sit there and collectively whine about unreal forcasts and expectations is ludacrice.  To the person you linked and also to you, sir, if you are so concerned that the US is not securing domestic traquility in Iraq, what are YOU doing about it?
<br />

<br />
For the person you linked I also say, Iraq is YOUR country, you should be out there engineering peace.  If you want the liberty you must take the responsibility.  DO SO and stop whining.
<br />

<br />
To you Elbrich, may I suggest that you look into supporting a group like Doctors Without Borders.  If you want to criticize, you should at least have the cajones to back up your concerns with real and positive action.  
<br />

<br />
Then, again, I dont think that the welfare of the Iraqi people is at all your concern.

				Hey hey, what's with the anger.  I'm not debating in this thread.  I'm giving information.
<br />

<br />
1. Someone mentioned that Atta met with Iraqi intelligence.  This was wrong so I offered information correcting it.
<br />
2. Tried to get back onto the original post by offering a different view, which I never claimed to agree with.  I haven't even explored the link's ideas much. I thought it might be interesting as an avenue of exploration.
<br />
3. Someone said that the search for WMD was not a reason for the war.  So, I offered letters from Bush to congress and objectives from General Franks pointing out that the WMD issue cannot be denied as a very important issue in the decision to go to war.<br />

Now, if you want to question the validity of freedom iraq, that is another thread.  I would say that great things have happened for some Iraqis.  Also, terrible things have happened for some Iraqi's.  And I don't think that the Bush administration really cared about the Iraqi people.  I think that if the West wasn't joined at the nads to the Middle East that Britain and the USA would not have bothered going.  So, they can't claim altruism as a valid reason for going (although it cannot be denied that some good things have happened).<br />

In the contrext you are speaking, I don't care for the Iraqi people either.  We went to war because their leader, assumed a threatening posture at a time that my country was attacked.  They by either their will or supplication allowed it and they will pay the consequences.  They and everyone else looking on should be glad it was Americans leading the charge to remove Hussein.
<br />

<br />
The UN ran from the country and denied it the benefit of aid at the first sign of trouble.
<br />

<br />
This constant drivel about Iraq not being safe from suicide bombers and terrorists is tiring as well.  Saying the streets of baghdad are not safe is like running around proclaiming the sky is blue.
<br />

<br />
Please, if you have something fresh to contribute please do. I think its about time you admitted you took up the wrong sides banner on an issue that has no neutrals.
<br />

<br />
If you are going to offer up problems at least have the jutzpah to offer up some kind of solution or alternative as well.  Poking holes in someone elses action in hindsight is cowardly.  Doing so without offering up other ways of dealing with the forces is the same as the village idiiot who complains about rocks in his shoe and yet does not have the wisdom to stop walking for 2 minutes to remove them.<br />

				Well Poppa pretty much covered what i planned to say, just in a more agressive manner.
<br />
I never tried to deny the WMD reason, but I never took it as the sole reason for the war either. That is the problme most opposition have, they thought that the WMDs was the sole reason, and the rest of the reasons were thrown in later. This was not the case, it is just how the media spun teh story. Also, I truely believe that with every other reason there was, that was more than enough to remove Saddam then just the WMDs.
<br />
I also think Bush cared greatly for the Iraqi people. Not in a one on one personal sense, but in the sense that he cared about the conditions they lived in every day. In reality, if Bush didnt care about the outcome of this campaign on the Iraqi people, they would have already been handed their country and a new government, and many more troops would have been pulled out. But, Bush does not want another ruler such as Saddam in power, so the new official government isnt in place yet, and there are more troops moving into Iraq then coming out.<br />

				You say that questioning the validity of iraqi freedom is one thing, but isn't a US presence in Iraq a step to that freedom?  Please tell me how you think they could establish a government on their own and please give me one good reason why we shouldn't be here.  If its money, it's better spent on improving the quality of life for others in my opinion, which is what i believe we are doing here.  Its sad that many think none of this money that Bush asks for will ever reach Iraq, food and supplies cost money, buildings and schools cost money, we've alredy started using that money for good things.  I'm not sure why there is a need to debate this issue...  Does anyone that <span style="font-style: italic">REALLY</span> knows whats going on here think this is a waste of time or effort?  Maybe i'm just blind, or my views are one sided.  I cannot see how anything that this country has done over here has been wrong.  Casualties of war happen, and its because people stay over here to keep the fight in their backyard, not in ours.<br />

Alienation of the U.N.
<br />
Turning attention and resources away from the countries and institutions that are a real threat.

If you have a chance take a read of this from the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College. It's not exactly what you are asking but is strongly related.  It was posted previously. You may also want to check out a book called <span style="text-decoration: underline">The Sorrows of Empire</span>.  I've only taken a quick flip through it but it presents some interesting avenues of though. <a href="http://duncan.statusbar.com/bounding.pdf" target="_blank">http://duncan.statusbar.com/bounding.pdf</a> 
<br />

<br />
I can come up with a list of good things too if you like.  I don't deny that many good things have happened because of the war.  However, I don't think they are worth the continuing cost.
<br />

<br />
I should also add... While I don't think the USA and Britain should have gone to war, I think that leaving now would make a bad situation worse.  Huge respect for the servicemen over there coping admirably with a difficult situation.
<br />

I shall leave you to flame me with words from these two great Americans. (No Poppa, I am not running from your incredible skills of reason or your vast and well documented supporting evidence.

Who killed these civilians Elberich? I dont want the answer "The US, because if they werent there it never would have happened". I want to know who actually killed those 10K civilians. Was it the US, or was it extremists, or was it the Iraqi army under Saddam?

F the UN. The UN was already damaged and alienated. The biggest reason the US is hated by so many, is because of US action under the UN flag. The US has done 90% of the "peacekeeping" work the UN has handed out. Funny how that makes people hate the US specifically and not other countries or the UN. We need an F UN emoticon.<br />

				Was it the wrong step in general?  Or the wrong step to Iraqi freedom?  What step do you propose the US should have taken?  Take a look at just one article about Saddam...
<br />

<br />
How Many People Has Saddam Killed?
<br />
By John F. Burns
<br />
The New York Times | January 27, 2003
<br />

<br />
The United States is facing a new turning point in its plans to go to war to topple Mr. Hussein, with additional American troops heading for the Persian Gulf, while France and Germany lead the international opposition. But the pressure President Bush has applied already has created chances to peer into the darkest recesses of Iraqi life.     
<br />

<br />
Mr. Bush was also attacking Mr. Hussein as a murdering tyrant. It was this accusation that led the Iraqi leader to virtually empty his prisons on Oct. 20, giving Western reporters, admitted that day to Abu Ghraib, a first-hand glimpse of the slaughterhouse the country has become.
<br />
     
<br />
Reporters who were swept along with tens of thousands of near-hysterical Iraqis through Abu Ghraib's high steel gates were there because Mr. Hussein, stung by Mr. Bush's condemnation, had declared an amnesty for tens of thousands of prisoners, including many who had served long sentences for political crimes. Afterward, it emerged that little of long-term significance had changed that day. Within a month, Iraqis began to speak of wide-scale re-arrests, and officials were whispering that Abu Ghraib, which had held at least 20,000 prisoners, was filling up again.
<br />

<br />
Where the comparison seems closest is in the regime's mercilessly sadistic character. Iraq has its gulag of prisons, dungeons and torture chambers — some of them acknowledged, like Abu Ghraib, and as many more disguised as hotels, sports centers and other innocent-sounding places. It has its overlapping secret-police agencies, and its culture of betrayal, with family members denouncing each other, and offices and factories becoming hives of perfidy.  Enemies of the state" are eliminated, and their spouses, adult children and even cousins are often tortured and killed along with them. The terror is self-compounding, with the state's power reinforced by stories that relatives of the victims pale to tell — of fingernail-extracting, eye-gouging, genital-shocking and bucket-drowning. Secret police rape prisoners' wives and daughters to force confessions and denunciations. There are assassinations, in Iraq and abroad, and, ultimately, the gallows, the firing squads and the pistol shots to the head.
<br />

<br />
DOING the arithmetic is an imprecise venture. The largest number of deaths attributable to Mr. Hussein's regime resulted from the war between Iraq and Iran between 1980 and 1988, which was launched by Mr. Hussein. Iraq says its own toll was 500,000, and Iran's reckoning ranges upward of 300,000. Then there are the casualties in the wake of Iraq's 1990 occupation of Kuwait. Iraq's official toll from American bombing in that war is 100,000 — surely a gross exaggeration — but nobody contests that thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians were killed in the American campaign to oust Mr. Hussein's forces from Kuwait. In addition, 1,000 Kuwaitis died during the fighting and occupation in their country. Casualties from Iraq's gulag are harder to estimate. Accounts collected by Western human rights groups from Iraqi émigrés and defectors have suggested that the number of those who have "disappeared" into the hands of the secret police, never to be heard from again, could be 200,000. As long as Mr. Hussein remains in power, figures like these will be uncheckable, but the huge toll is palpable nonetheless.
<br />

<br />
In recent years, the inexorable nature of Iraq's horrors have been demonstrated by new campaigns bearing the special hallmark of Mr. Hussein. In 1999, a complaint about prison overcrowding led to an instruction from the Iraqi leader for a "prison cleansing" drive. This resulted, according to human rights groups, in hundreds, and possibly thousands, of executions.
<br />

<br />
Using a satanic arithmetic, prison governors worked out how many prisoners would have to be hanged to bring the numbers down to stipulated levels, even taking into account the time remaining in the inmates' sentences. As 20 and 30 prisoners at a time were executed at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere, warders trailed through cities like Baghdad, "selling" exemption from execution to shocked families, according to people in Iraq who said they had spoken to relatives of those involved. Bribes of money, furniture, cars and even property titles brought only temporary stays.
<br />

<br />
More recently, according to Iraqis who fled to Jordan and other neighboring countries, scores of women have been executed under a new twist in a "return to faith" campaign proclaimed by Mr. Hussein. Aimed at bolstering his support across the Islamic world, the campaign led early on to a ban on drinking alcohol in public. Then, some time in the last two years, it widened to include the public killing of accused prostitutes.
<br />

<br />
Often, the executions have been carried out by the Fedayeen Saddam, a paramilitary group headed by Mr. Hussein's oldest son, 38-year-old Uday. These men, masked and clad in black, make the women kneel in busy city squares, along crowded sidewalks, or in neighborhood plots, then behead them with swords. The families of some victims have claimed they were innocent of any crime save that of criticizing Mr. Hussein.

<br />
What step do you propose we should have taken?  As the article states, a countless thousands of people have died from his rule, and that of his sons.  Were we to allow this $hit to continue because of money?  Does the innocent body count at the hands of the good guys even begin to match that of a tyrant who kills his own people?  If the UN and other neighboring countries look down on our actions, imho they can sit and spin.  This $hit didn't come from some fantasy horror story, this man murdered his own people in the streets because they tried to have opinions of their own.  War has a cost, but turning your back on a situation like this and then trying to rationalize it by some political means of economy or other $hit is just sad.  I'm not saying that the reasons you listed are pointless, or that they aren't substancial setbacks to this countries treaties and political and echenomical standings, but for Fuk's sake i dont think this could have been taken care of any other way.  We tried everything and as soon as we thought things were fine he was pushing the limits again, even re arresting those he had just let go and placing SAM sites ect on top of hospitals...  I don't think Koombyah would work in that situation, and i'm just thankful that we finally went in there.    My point being:  do you risk war and casualties of 10,000 innocent now, or try yet another peace talk so that in a month he can murder another 20,000?  Maybe i'm beating a dead horse and maybe there is no convincing you guys, but what we did was the right thing and a last resort.
<br />

<br />
Or how about some more.  Check out <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/bodycount.htm" target="_blank">http://www.iraqbodycount.net/bodycount.htm</a>
<br />
See how many of the "casualties" were bystanders or because someone tried to attack a US convoy.  These numbers are sad, and many deaths came from bombing ect, but the total count doesnt even begin to match what Saddam did in power.
<br />

<br />
Also cruising around, look at this list of Saddam and his sons.
<br />
Used their own people as human shields in countless instances.
<br />

<br />
-Engaged in acts of genocide against Shi'a Muslims in the south of Iraq.
<br />
-Forced Iraqi civilians to take up arms at gunpoint.
<br />
-Executed Iraqi civilians on the spot for any suspicion of disloyalty or even indifference.
<br />
-Cut off food and water to Shi'a Muslim urban populations.
<br />
-Used the most sacred shrines of Iraq's Shi'as as military strongpoints and arms caches.
<br />
-Used hospitals as military staging areas, fighting positions and arms storage depots.
<br />
-Took Iraqi family members, including children, hostage.
<br />
-Executed allied POWs in cold blood, while abusing others.
<br />
-Prevented the International Red Cross or Red Crescent from visiting allied soldiers taken as POWs.
<br />
-Fought in civilian clothes, in violation of the Geneva Convention and the Laws of War.
<br />
-Employed false surrenders to lure allied troops into ambushes, in violation of the same.
<br />
-Committed multiple acts of terrorism against Iraqi civilians and coalition forces.
<br />
-Forced unwilling soldiers to attack allied forces by executing some and driving the others forward at machine-gun point - far from patriotic resistance, this is the mass murder of Iraqis by Iraqis.
<br />
-Attempted to create an ecological and economic catastrophe in Iraq's Shi'a and Kurdish regions by rigging oil fields for demolition.
<br />
-Attempted to prevent relief supplies from reaching Iraqi civilians.
<br />
-Welcomed and harbored terrorists from abroad.
<br />
-Took practical steps to prepare Iraqi troops for the use of chemical weapons against allied forces.
<br />

<br />
Koombyah working yet?
<br />

<br />
Does this explain some of the civilian casualties?  WAR IS HELL and INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE, but for the greater good we take their losses with the sympahy that we have for our own.  I'm sorry, i don't see anything else we could have done to stop this carnage.<br />

 Should we expect US forces to be freeing Tibet soonish then seeing as it all about Humanity issues?
<br />
  Do I think geting ride of Saddam was a good thing yes do I think the reasons given at teh time where a reasonable excuse to go to war no if you wana take some one out for being a piece of scum and interfering with your $$ then have the balls to stand up and tell the world that.  However if you want to use force makes right don't get all weepy eyed when someone else does it to you.

				And your response is based on teh fact that it is ok for teh US to respond with voilence in it's own self intrest but not another country towards the US.  If the US's government really cared about other countries human rights volations there are many countries with worse recoreds then Iraq.  Why has nothing been down about them with teh same strong arm tatics as Iraq?  I am argueing the reasons behind the invasion of another country sure one that had a government that I did not particularly agree or like but another country, and teh reasons given for this invasion.  Poppa I have yet to hear anything that tells me why it is justified for the US to invade one country yet it was wrong for that country to invade another except human rights voilations.  Well I have suplied you with a link that leads to a list of human rights voliations which are just as bad.  So by teh reasoning given for teh Iraq invasion we should therefore have opperation Tibet freedom happening soon?  And poppa I am not anti war I am just anti this one well at least teh BS reasons given for it.  What I find stupid is one country saying hay it is allright for us to invade a country because we want to and ignore UN and teh countrys that make it up but then act all upset when other countys do it or have done it.

I have said no such thing!

It is fair for all nations to protect their self interests.  If it comes to it, it is fair for them to use violence in self protection against dangers and perceived threats.

You are arguing one little reason out of many and doing so by comparing apples and oranges.
<br />

<br />
Apples and oranges are both fruit.
<br />

<br />
I may hunger for an apple. Eating an orange will not neccessarily stop that hunger.
<br />

<br />
I may have a pork sandwich and prefer an apple with it.
<br />

<br />
When I look at the apple and the orange, I may find that the apple is more ripe.
<br />

<br />
Sadam Hussein was not the worlds only fruit.  He was the one that got eaten first.  But removing him does not require us to remove everyone else we dont like or have an issue with.  
<br />

<br />
Your arguement would mean that I would ahve to eat an orange EVERY time I ate an apple.  Then, of course, someone else is going to force bananas on me and pineapples as well.  The grape growers association will send me legal notice I suppose...
<br />

<br />
The idea is absurd.  Your arguement fails.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
Harden, there are 7 previous pages in this thread. They are filled with reasons to remove Hussein.  The fact that he was rattling his saber when the US was attacked was one of the biggest and my favorite to pick on.
<br />

<br />
Self-protection is the primary foundation for all morals.
<br />

<br />
Your favorite arguement is, unfortunately, a schism from reality.  Id meditate on it a little bit if I were you.  If what you said is true, and this is the only arguement you have: You are making a large and important determination on fallicious logic.<br />

I will come out and say this. When the Taliban attacked the US, it was not a country, and their self interest was to kill any and all americans, wether military or civilian.
<br />
Saddam's "Iraq self interest" was to take over Kuwait so that there was one less oil producing country to compete against, and they got all the oil in the country. He also had the same self interest as the Taliban, and said so on more then one occasion.

Since you obviously arent from, and currently dont live, in the US. What were the reasons you were given for a country you dont associate with going to war? Let me guess, WMD's was the only reason you heard. Well sorry to burst your bubble, but it wasnt the only reason. The US did go to war saying Saddam was a @#%$ sucking @#%$ and he was going to be removed from power.

<br />
Is this your way of saying the US deserved what happened on Sep 11? Since World War 2, up until Iraqi Freedom, every military campaign the US has done, has been at the request of another country, or mostly, the UN. So why the @#%$ didnt UN headquarters get planes run into them? They used the US for their force makes right campaigns, so they should have been retaliated against right? I wouldnt get weepy eyed about that.
<br />
I bet your French Harden, arent you?
<br />
After all the @#%$ the US did for the UN to be hated, why the @#%$ cant we do something for ourselves to make everyone hate us? @#%$ it, @#%$ happens, they already hate us, whats a little more hatred on top of it?<br />
