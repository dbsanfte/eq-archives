<font class="print-normal">In my e-mail I got a message today from the <a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">Druid's Grove</a> staff that went out to all of their users. It states that they'll be moving away from their EZboard service over to vbulletin. This sounds exactly like the change that Graffe's Wizard site went through a few months back. For the larger communities that recieve massive amounts of views and posts, it seems they've all been moving away form EZboard because it becomes too expensive. However, the staff from Druid's Grove did state the following:<br>
<br>
&quot;<i>Let me be clear - Ezboards has been good to us; but there is more that we like to do with our community. The community itself has been requesting this for a long time coming and now we are actual doing it.</i>&quot;<br>

Hello all -<br>
<br>
I know the last time we talked about the EZBoard Community Chest, we<br>
(the Druids Grove staff) promised that this would be the last time,<br>
and that before the next Gold period was over, we'd move to a new<br>
forum.<br>
<br>
Well, as most of you know, we're all a group of procrastinators here<br>
(phpBB just didn't pass the test, so we are going with vbulletins), so<br>
we had to wait till the last minute! The good news is that we will be<br>
moving off the EZBoards! We will be keeping all of our old history and<br>
posts, however we will not (and I know this'll break your hearts) be<br>
keeping our post counts.<br>
<br>
Soon enough we'll start to open up registration for all of you to sign<br>
up with us again. These forums will be locked, and all users will be<br>
redirected to our new forums. You'll also note that we've put up a<br>
Donate! button which takes you to a PayPal screen. We're asking<br>
everyone who can to help out and chip in a few when possible. We're<br>
not expecting you to go into hoc for us, but hopefully if you've<br>
called the Druids Grove home for a while, you'll be willing to help<br>
out with some of the bills. The donations will help pay for the costs<br>
of the server, bandwidth, software, and so forth. As long as the<br>
community is interested, we will continuously add upgrades to our home<br>
over time.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/donate.htm">http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/donate.htm</a><br>
<br>
*Don't worry about that &quot;non-secure items&quot; warning you get when you<br>
click on the PayPal link, that's due to the image we placed on the<br>
banner.<br>
<br>
We plan on putting some items into place where the folks who donate<br>
will get some cool schwag from us - but we haven't quite figured out<br>
how to do it, or what to give you guys yet. And yes, custom supporter<br>
titles have been suggested!<br>
<br>
Let me be clear - Ezboards has been good to us; but there is more that<br>
we like to do with our community. The community itself has been<br>
requesting this for a long time coming and now we are actual doing<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thank you Again,<br>
<br>
The Druids Grove Staff -<br>
An Everquest Community<br />
