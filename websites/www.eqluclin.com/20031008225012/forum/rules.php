Note that Flames & Rants permits behavior that will get users banned if that behavior is carried out in any other part of the board. Flames & Rants is NOT work safe; users who are at work are advised not to browse that forum. By posting in Flames & Rants, the poster agrees to subject themselves to scrutiny and attack from the more base elements of the Luclin community. Luclin, its moderators, and its service provider take no responsibility for what happens if users choose to disregard this warning.  It is the responsibility of the user to stay out of the Flames & Rants forum. Users are absolutely guaranteed to find something in Flames & Rants that is offensive, and posters there will often be viciously attacked. You'll find no sympathy from anyone if you are attacked in Flames & Rants. Don't post there in the first place. <br /><br /><b>Any user who wishes to view Flames & Rants must have a registered account. They must also voluntarily add themselves to the Flames & Rants access list. By adding yourself, you certify that you are of legal age to view adult content in your locality, and you absolve Luclin, its moderators, and our service provider from responsibility for anything you see and anything that happens to you in that forum. It is your responsibility and yours alone. If you refuse these terms, you are forbidden to view the Flames & Rants forum.</b><br /><br />In simpler terms: If you can't take the heat, then stay out of Flames & Rants. You have no other recourse.<br /><br />If you accept these terms, click <a href="http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/groupcp.php?g=11">here</a> and click <b>Join Group</b> to be added to the allowed group.<br /><br />The rules for Flames & Rants are much simpler. There will be no:<br /><ol type="1"><li>Editing. Posts made in Flames & Rants cannot be edited.<br /><li>Spamming. Do not spam in Flames & Rants.<br /><li>Advertising. No advertising links are tolerated in Flames & Rants.<br /><li>Racism. Even the Flames & Rants crowd won't support racist commentary. Don't do it.<br /><li>Pornography. Any lewd or obscene content will be deleted immediately. <br /><li>Buying & Selling of Everquest virtual property will not be allowed.</ol>Flames & Rants has very different privacy rules. The only private information that will be deleted from the Flames & Rants forum are social security numbers, credit card numbers, IP addresses, and other non-public information that may be used in identity theft. Publically availiable information that can be found with a simple web search such as a person's name, address, phone number, and picture, is afforded no protection in Flames & Rants. Any public information will remain posted, even with repeated complaints from the user asking for it to be taken down. This information is public by law, therefore we have no reason to take it down.<br /><br /><a class="postlink" href="#Top">Back to top</a></span></td>

The moderators will conduct warnings and banning as follows:<br /><ol type="1"><li>First offenders will be warned by a moderator. Most mistakes are unintentional.<br /><li>Second offenders will be warned again, and will have their post limit restricted to 3 posts a day for a time.<br /><li>Third offenders may be banned from the forum he has disrupted, or from the boards entirely.</ol>Offenders who are making it a point to break rules and disrupt the forums may be banned immediately without any warning whatsoever. Flames & Rants regulars who continually harass people in other forums will be restricted from posting in any forum except for Flames & Rants. Offenders who apologize for their behavior and make an effort to correct it will have their restrictions and bans lifted after a period of time. Those who don't, won't.<br /><br />Any questions, requests for rule changes or clarifications, or other comments should be sent to a moderator or brought up in the general forum for consideration by everyone. The forums support a private message feature, this is the best way to get in touch with your moderators.<br /><br /><a class="postlink" href="#Top">Back to top</a></span></td>
