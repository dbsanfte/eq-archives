After Afghanistan? I'm sorry, I had no idea things were all wrapped up in Afghanistan. Where's Osama? As for your intention, that means jack if you can't back it up with facts and evidence. That wasn't done, and now that the invasion is over, the "big bad dictator" angle is being a tad overplayed.

Yes. Canada was already committed to helping you in Afghanistan, a fact that is conveniently and constantly forgotten by those who would love to paint it in a bad light.

Odd, roadblocks are still blowing up. You're naive to think that he was hiding out in holes for no other reason than that he had got noplace else to go.

We are frustrating nothing. Your enemy is in the hills of Pakistan, and trained his troops in Afghanistan. He was born in Saudi Arabia, and hired men from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia itself. When are you going to get that through your head? Why are you ignoring bin Laden in favour of your president's vendetta against Saddam Hussein?

<br />
Yes it is. I don't see Osama bin Laden cooling his heels in Guantanamo, and I don't see Al Qaeda being hunted like the dogs they are. Afghanistan is falling back into ruin and chaos, a ripe breeding ground for anti-U.S. sentiment. No matter how much you want to believe it, there is no 9/11 - Iraq connection. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3118262.stm" target="_blank" class="postlink">Even George W Bush says so</a>.
<br />

<br />
The world has proven through Afghanistan that it will fight alongside the United States. It's just too bad the United States refuses to realize where the real danger lies. I still haven't read the clause where it says that in order to be an ally, a country has to follow the U.S. blindly as they stomp all over anybody they deem "bad" without evidence to back it up, while ignoring the real enemy.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Regarding those weapons buried in holes all over Iraq:</span>
<br />

<br />
1. Have the U.S. inspectors, who have virtually unfettered access to the entire country, found anything? Are they in fact any more effective than the UN inspectors at finding supposed WMDs?
<br />

<br />
2. Having buried those weapons in holes all over his country, would Saddam have been able to deploy them in the 45 minutes that the scaremongers assured us was possible? Do weapons buried in holes represent an immediate and dangerous threat to the United States or her interests?
<br />

<br />
If the answer to these questions is <span style="font-style: italic">no</span>, then the invasion and subsequent loss of American lives was ill-timed and based on gross manipulation of intelligence data.

Stryke do you honestly believe the US Gov't just targets and destroys random buildings that we *think* might be producing chemical weapons?  I promise you that targets like this don't just get chosen on a whim.  We have lots and lots of people doing round the clock intel work...and we don't make mistakes very often.  We have to have near 100% fool-proof confirmation that a target is what we think it is before we'll strike it. 
<br />

<br />
It's hard to prove that the plant was producing things other than asprin when you can't send your people in to sift through the rubble.  I know the media has many convinced that a chemical weapons lab should be a well lit, ultra modern facility with a banner saying "CHEMICAL WEAPONS PLANT" hung up across the front...but thats usually not how it work.   
<br />

<br />
As far as Iraq having chem/bio weapons...if you think they didn't, you're naive.  Thats it and thats all.  Again, the media has most people believing that we were going to find a big stockpile of them.  Saddam was not a complete idiot.  He knew we were coming.  I imagine he shipped most of those weapons to Syria, which is probably happy to have them...the same way Saddam sent most of his air force to Iran in 91.  Of course when the war was over and Saddam asked for his MIG's back, Iran said "what MIGs?" and kept them.
<br />

<br />
The rest, if any, are probably burried somewhere in the sand.  People don't realize how easy it is to hide something like this.  Dig hole, insert WMD, cover.  Done.  It's that simple.  You don't need a huge lab to produce anthrax, you need a chemistry set and a basement.  
<br />

<br />
In any case, Saddam not only produce chem weapons (at the very least), he used them.  On his people.  Often.  You think he just what...ran out?  Decided to be a kinder, gentler Saddam, and stopped using/making them?  Yes, I'm sure thats it.  I bet Saddam just woke up one sunny Monday morning and said "Yanno what, Bush is right, I really should stop using and making chemical weapons."  Then he got on the phone to his military leaders and said "Hey guy, relax.  Go out and destroy your WMD, I don't think I want them anymore."

<br />
Well, you pretty much thought wrong.  As we speak, the Afghans are writing their own constitution.  The process is going on...right now.  It'll be done in a few weeks.  Its a nice, moderate constitution with a strong president and for the most part, we (the US) are very happy with how it reads.  We were able to keep hard-line Islamic Law out of it, keep the Afghan president as a strong central leader (many of the northern tribes wanted two vice presidents plus a prime minister and more parliment...to water down the position of president).  
<br />

<br />
We will probably still have troops there, much the same as we have troops in South Korea,  but for the most part Afghanistan is well on it's way to becoming part of the civilized world again.  We came in, kicked the crap out of the Taliban, sent them scrambling for the mountains and wrecked their infastructure.  
<br />

<br />
Yes, Osama is still on the run.  Stryke, if you gave me pretty much limitless funding and the ability to obtain false documents pretty much at will and sent me on the run...I would very, very difficult to find.  Of course, that didn't work out so well for Saddam.  Finding him had to have pissed liberals off...now they can't play the all powerful "Where's Saddam" card anymore.  TT.  
<br />

<br />
Osama is somewhere in the Afghanistan/Pakistan boreder area.  An area which just happens to consist of some of the most rugged, mountainous terrain in the world.  Several million square miles of it.  How do you find someone in that Stryke?  We may never find him, although I imagine sooner or later, one of his idealistic young terrorists is going to fall in love with some girl he meats in a little mountain town.  He's going to marry her and have a kid and she's going to want him to stay at home and farm with the rest of the family..and Osama is going to come and grab him and take him back to the Terrorist cave.  And wifey ain't going to like that much because now shes stuck home with the kiddos and no husband...and all of a sudden 25 million bones starts to look real appealing...and the next time a US patrol drives through she quietly points up the mountain side and says "See that cave..."
<br />

<br />
But maybe not.  Maybe Osama will get to live in a cave down by the river forever.  Lah-De-Freakin'-Dah (as Chris Farley would have said).  Good for him.  It must be a wonderful life...living in a cave in frozen %@$# Afghanistan in the winter.  Where do I sign up for that?

And there is still crime in the world (even in Canada!).  I'm sorry that Coalition forces have not been able to stop every single person who wants us out of the country yet.  Unfortunatly we are not a devine power.  The (rather pathetic) attacks will continue until we leave.  Why?  Because there's always a nut with a bomb.

Well, you call em hills, I call them HUGE FRIGGIN MOUNTAINS, but it's all sementics.  Because we already handled Bin Laden.  As I said earlier, he may still roam free but for the most part his networks have been crushed.  Taliban is done.  AQ is a shell of its former self.  Priorities have not been shifted...we still have plenty of ground pounders in Afghanistan.  Unfortunatly you seem to think, however, that it is only possible for us to handle one project at once.  The US military has been multi-tasking for decades.  We are very good at it.

LOL?  No Stryke.  No.  Afghanistan is writing it's constitution.  They started about 10 days ago. The time frame to have it done is a few weeks.  Elections middle of next year.  So...how is it falling back into ruin and chaos?
<br />

<br />
I won't deny that there are still terrorists and anti-US sentiment in Afghanistan but most of it is leaderless rabble having trouble figuring out which end of the gun is the dangerous end...let alone managing to hit a target of value.  Don't believe the hype man.  Like I said in another thread, when terrorist forces go up against Coalition forces, they die.  In large quantities.
<br />

<br />
Now, I wont say that the people arguing that Canada backed out of the "alliance" are right.  They're not.  Canadian leadership did what it thought was right.  I have no problem with that.  However, going on and on about "you haven't found Osama, you haven't found WMD," man thats just ignorant.

Stryke, the real threat to US (and every western-alligned country and it's over-seas assets) are the people who see our way of life (and Canada's way of life) as wrong...and would do violence to those who practice it.  There is no one person or one place that is the root of the problem.  Finding Osama will not solve the problem.  
<br />

<br />
Regardless of WMD, regardless of 9-11 ties, the fall of Saddam's regime and his capture end a terrible chapter in Iraqi history.  They now have the power to seize the day and make a new future for themselve, and we're trying to help.  It is possible that it wont succeed, but an evil, evil man with more blood on his hands than any of us could possibly imagine is now a proverbial "dead man walking."  Do I feel safer that Saddam is gone?  Nah, not really (but I didn't really feel much of a threat in the first place...and I lived right outside DC for the vast majority of this time).  I do however, feel a sense of righteousness that Saddam is done, and that I played a role, however minute, in being part of it.  I don't need WMD or 9-11 ties to know that this was the right thing.  I never did.<span class="gensmall"></span>

<br />
VERY true.  The U.S. even had a few friendly fire incidents with them.  They are over there fighting along side U.S. troops.  When the U.S. was attacked, Canada went to war with us against our enemies.
<br />

<br />
It's not there obligation to go with us on an invasion.  It's just there obligation not to help our enemy hurt us.  Like France buying oil sending money to Iraq to help fund there armies.  I dont know that Canada did anything like that.  They have been our allies and will remain as far as I am concerned.<span class="gensmall"></span>

The base I was at in Afghanistan was protected by the Canadians.  While U.S. troops could have done the same thing, it wasnt U.S. troops.  It wasnt just for show they were there to protect anyone inside the fences.  There support allowed the U.S. to either A) not deploy as many americans or B)  Extend the reach and power in afghanistan with the troops that were no longer needed to defend the base.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Don't spaz out over this.  Any assistance that results in saving US troops is more than symbolic in my book.  Waving a flag is symbolic.  Putting troops into harms way means something to me and I will acknowledge it.  And the way the Bush Administration is complaining about the lack of help from its allies, one can assume the Canadian help is needed...as has been pointed out, it allows us to deploy our own troops elsewhere.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Their assistance saved US lives and that's A-OK with me.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">Five snipers from the 3PPCLI were awarded the bronze star by the USA for their 19 days work with the USA's 187th brigade (bringing the total to 30 bronze stars for PPCLI in Afghanistan).  
<br />

<br />
The specific incident you are refering to happened in the Shah-i-Kot Valley during Operation Anaconda, which took place alonside Operation Harpoon.  A group of the USA's 101st Airborne was pinned by machinegun and mortar fire.  Two teams of 3PPCLI snipers removed the pin.  One of the shots was over 2,400 meters.  This is unnofically the longest ever sniper shot.  If my math serves, and the weapon was a McMillan Tac-50 12.7mm and not the older C3A1 7.62mm, that would mean about a 3 second flight time.
<br />

<br />
edit: Thinking on it.  It would have to be the McMillan.  The C3 is held by the team leader, not the shooter, and probably wouldn't make a shot much over 800 meters.
<br />

<br />
edit again: My flight time could be off.  The McMillan is well after my time.  Any takers on a more accurate calculation?<span class="gensmall"></span>
