				I'm a reader of Savage Love, a popular national sex column. In this latest article, something i've thought about for a while popped up. It was about the damage that Sex Ed does to the american youth, portrayed in the fashion it popularly is. Read below for details by Dan Savage, the writer of Savage Love.
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
I'm an 18-year-old senior in high school. I met a girl at a party one night, and we ended up going out for about a month. During that time, we never went further than me fingering her, because she didn't want to. We had both had sex before, she with her boyfriend of eight months (they broke up before we met), and I with a couple of stoner chicks. I'm pretty into partying, and I always toke up when the opportunity arises. She's not into partying at all.
<br />

<br />
On New Year's Eve, I went to a party after I dropped her off at 1 a.m., and I got pretty @#%$ up. In truth, Dan, I was tripping and I can't remember half the night. I do remember making out with two other girls. I felt awful and told the girl I had been dating about it. She didn't dump me, and we continued to date for another week, at which time she ended it, saying she just didn't like me anymore. I think she actually broke up with me because I nearly cheated on her, and because she didn't approve of my party habits, but when I asked her this, she denied it.
<br />

<br />
Then, a week after we broke up, we were talking in my room, and we started making out and proceeded to have sex. She had always told me that she couldn't have sex without love, and that sex was a very emotional thing for her. Afterward, I asked her if she wanted to start dating again, and she said no. She said she doesn't like me like that, and that she was just horny. Now, she tells me she likes a different guy. Dan, please tell me, what the @#%$ is going on?
<br />
Tormented, Horny & Confused
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
It's like this, THC: This girl, like most of today's young people, was probably subjected to "abstinence education," a.k.a. the sex-negative, sex-phobic moralizing that passes for sex education in the U.S. nowadays. In her abstinence-ed classes, your on-your-%$#@!-again/off-your-%$#@!-again girlfriend was taught that anyone, but especially any girl, who has sex with someone to whom she isn't married (or, failing that, passionately in love with and committed to marrying ASAP) is a Terrible Person with Terrible Morals who will contract a number of Terrible STDs and die a Terrible Death. Girls who've fallen for this line of crap—a small minority, I'm happy to report—can frequently be overheard saying things like, "I couldn't have sex without love..." when they're being finger-@#%$ by stoner boys they've been dating for a few weeks.
<br />

<br />
But she's still young and healthy, so she's naturally horny as hell, and there you were, all glassy-eyed and willing. 
<br />
Are you with me, THC? When your ex-girlfriend/current lay told you she could only have sex with a man she loved, kiddo, she was lying—to herself, first and foremost, but also to you. While you were dating, she wanted you to think she was a Good Person—i.e., the kind of person who could only have sex with someone she loved. But she's still young and healthy, so she's naturally horny as hell, and there you were, all glassy-eyed and willing. But she couldn't @#%$ you, because you might think she was a Terrible Person. Once you revealed yourself to be a near-cheater and a bit too much of a stoner for her tastes, and once she dumped your %@$#, then it no longer mattered to her what you thought of her. So it's precisely because she's no longer seriously interested in you, precisely because she doesn't like you anymore, that she was able to finally give herself permission to @#%$ your stoned brains out.
<br />

<br />
Needless to say, your ex-girlfriend's behavior was not the intended outcome of abstinence education. To the Bible-thumpers out there pushing abstinence education, I'd like to say this: If you continue to sow this @#%$—if you persist in your attempts to stamp out sexual desire in young people—you will continue to reap a whirlwind of oft-hilarious unintended consequences, from young straight people having casual anal sex (you can get @#%$ in the %@$# and still be a virgin, right?) to babies stuffed in trash cans at proms.
<br />

<br />
Back to you, THC: That other guy? The one your ex-girlfriend is interested in now? While she's @#%$ your brains out, she is—without a doubt, I promise you—telling that boy two towns over that she couldn't possibly have sex with someone she doesn't really love.
<br />

<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
What do you guys think about Dan's thoughts of Sex Ed in the US? I am majorally in agreement that weird @#%$ happens when you teach SE in the fashion that it traditionally has been, most of which is unintended.<br />

				9.99 out of ten boys/men won't understand this......and I say 9.99 out of ten because the 10th guy might understand but won't give a @#%$ anyway.
<br />

<br />
The reason we should abstain from sex before marriage, or at least abstain from being complete whores is to have self respect for ones self after marriage.
<br />

<br />
There isn't one man on this planet who doesn't wish they will marry a virgin, or at least be her only one.  Yet they are most obliged to @#%$ 20+ girls on their way to that virgin.  That doesn't compute since the ratio is pretty close to 50/50.
<br />

<br />
And then, men have the <span style="font-style: italic">audacity</span> to argue higher respect, sexually, over a woman with multiple partners before marriage.  In my eyes it makes both sides used and discarded.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Not to mention disease and pregnancy.  As long as you're not contributing to either of these, hump like bunnies as far as I'm concerned....just don't say I didn't warn ya about the respect issue.<br />

				Telling someone NOT to do something will only want them to do it more. Sex should be taught to be done safely, not taught as a bad or evil thing. Waiting for marriage is pointless... marriages end in divorce, what... 50% of the time?
<br />

<br />
Also, the views on males and females, in regards to sex, are different for the following reason: in most cases (heterosexual cases that is!) men have to try to get the girl... so if the guy gets the girl it's like he succeeded in something. We all know the girl decides wether or not sex is gonna happen. So pretty much, the guy needs to work for it, and the girl needs to fend it off. That's why the views are different. That's why a guy who has sex with a lot of girls is a stud, and the girl who has sex with a lot of guys is a slut. It sucks, but it's the way it is... just because of the current sexual rituals that are in place.<br />

				People have been losing virginity before marriage since the beginning of time, nothing unusual about it.  The entire reason marriage was started and sex was abstained until marriage was to ensure a reliable method of tracking lineage through the father and establishing a patriarchial system of dominance.  Everyone knows who their mother is (really no brainer here as to why) knowing who the father is can be harder (cuculodry anyone?).  The funny thing is men typically complain that marriage is some type of entrapment, but the reality is marriage was created to socially and sexually trap the female.  Married man cheats, no biggie to many people(even though yes this is bad), married woman cheats and all hell comes down upon her.
<br />

<br />
Back more on topic, Sex Ed should be limited to the education portion of sex.  Making teachers teach some type of system of morality about sex does nothing to help the situation.  The people who should be teaching some type of morality about sex are the parents, not schools.  One persons set of mores about sex may differ widely from anothers and intrinsically there is nothing wrong about that (this of course is in regards to most HEALTHY views on sex), it just doesn't need to be taught to other kids.
<br />

<br />
The girl in the above story seems to have an extremely unhealthy (or unrealistic perhaps) view on sex and physical relationships.  Essentially she is lying to herself through a warped system of justification so that she can have sex, something she may or may not have really wanted to do.  Which is not to be totally unexpected, shes a kid doing something society has said is for adults (and for good reason).  The problem comes from is that this girl (and guy and others like them) do not seem to understand the responsibility that comes from behaving like an adult (not that all true adults understand this either).
<br />

<br />
The idea that sex is evil or that having it some how relegates one to whore or unclean status needs to stop.  At the same time the idea that sex is no big deal like a hand shake needs to stop as well.  Neither of these actually stop people from having sex, outside of what many religions and societies consider the proper mode, mainly marriage.<br />

				Girls are brought up to believe that they have to be in love with the one they have sex with. Boys are not brought up that way. The example of how far this attitude goes can best be illustrated by looking at @#%$ and lesbian relations (these cases just amplify the social constructions of sexuality). Lesbians, being brought up to believe that to have sex, they have to be in love with the partner; get stuck in the idea that if they had sex, then therefore they must be in love. Which leads to the creaky old (well it used to be a joke) joke about what do lesbians do on their second date... they rent a u-haul and move in together. @#%$ men on the other hand, act as if a hard-on is a terrible thing to waste. So they don't. More than 365 sexual partners in a year? Frankly that scares me.  20,000 sexual partners in your lifetime? I don't even want to be in the same room as you, who knows what sort of diseases you are spreading.
<br />

<br />
Abstinence education does not work for sex, nor for drugs. It is what you get when you politicize education and let religious fanatics try to run things. Turning sex into something mystical and forbidden is unhealthy. There are more than a few cases where teen girls get pregnant without understanding that it is the result of sex. Parents won't talk to their kids about sex, teachers can't. No wonder sex ed is so fvcked up. 
<br />

<br />
I concur with Trysbina. For a long time, laws prohibited married women from owning anything. In many legal systems, they stopped being people when they got married (things like: married women cannot give testimony in court, or maybe only with their husband's permission, or a married couple becomes one person under the eyes of the law, and that person is the husband). Unowned women were seen as suspect: if she was married, her husband owned her. Before she was married, her father, brothers or uncles owned her. If she was a widow, her brothers or sons owned her. If she was a nun, then Jesus owned her. If she was not owned by any of the above, then she was a witch: satan owned her, as unowned women were not allowed to exist. 
<br />

<br />
Studies going back as far as the 1940s show that between 5% and 30% of the men married to women were not the biological fathers of their children. Infidelity, promiscuity and adultery are not confined to the human race either. 
<br />

<br />
My opinion? If you are not in love with the other person when you are having sex with them, then you are just masturbating and using their body instead of your hands. Be honest with yourself and just go play with yourself instead of someone else.<br />

Daari, 
<br />
I have no desire to marry a virgin. She will not only be inexperienced to please me in bed. I have no desire to teach a girl how to have sex again. I’m not saying I want a girl who’s loose, but at least a few partners is desirable. Furthermore, I personally would not want to be five years into the marriage, and have her getting curious “what would it be like to sleep with someone else?” I would like her to have a bit of variety before she settled on me, so she would at least have something to compare me to if nothing else, and hopefully enough experience to curb her curiosity.<br />

				I personally think we should be Teaching Masturbation in school. If the girls learn how to take care of themselves, they will be less likely to fool around with boys who know little to nothing (in my experience anyway) of how to pleasure a female. 
<br />

<br />
Give every 12 year old girl a vibrator and rechargeable batteries and watch the teen pregnancy rates plummet. I would be happy to see my tax dollars go to fund this, rather than the current brainwashing program. 
<br />

<br />
Not sure how I escaped the warping the other females in my generation received... Sex is one of the only fun forms of exercise. Sure its better when you feel something for the other person, but if you don't and take precautions regarding disease and pregnancy, you can still enjoy it for what it is.<br />
