				I decided to actually watch the movie in order to be a fair judge of it; somewhat ironic that I chose to watch it on July 4th.
<br />

<br />
First off, there is no way that this movie could be considered a fair piece of documentry journalism.  It is like Moore called for a debate but forgot to invite the other side.  There is no way that this movie could possibly be taken as something other than a direct attack on the Bush administration.
<br />
However, to be fair, I do not think that Moore makes any pretenses that the movie is not one-sided.  He starts right off the bat attacking Bush and Company with the Florida election scandal.  Moore does not give the opportunity to even think for a moment that this is a non-bias movie.
<br />
I think this distinction is important because it would be a totally different situation if Moore tried to pass off his film as a true documentry; he doesn't even try to so therefore there is no reason to believe that is his goal.
<br />

<br />
I will give credit to Michael Moore that he is a very creative filmaker and I appreciate his skills on that level.  He seems to have an interesting quirky sense of humor that I actually enjoy.
<br />

<br />
On with my review.  Just a prior warning some of this may be very jumbled because I am trying to quickly type this out while it is still fresh in my memory.
<br />

<br />
To begin with, Michael Moore attempts to draw some very interesting connection with the Bush family and the voting scandal of the 2000 election in Florida.  Basically Moore tries to point out how Bush has all of these 'connections' and made a few remarks prior to the election that Florida was a sure thing.  I have a problem with this for two main reasons.
<br />
  --  All politicians and especially presidential candidates are going to have connections all over the place.  He totally disregards the fact that Al Gore and every other politician has basically the same ties.  That is they know people who are CEOs or state officials.
<br />
  --  He shows videos of Bush saying that Florida will be a win and Moore tries to hint that Bush planned in advance of rigging the election.  My problem with this is that no candidate is going to go out in public stating that they have the full intention of losing an election.  At least I have never seen it, so therefore I think it is quite natural and expected for Bush to convey confidance that he will win the state of Florida.
<br />

<br />
Moore then goes on and on how Bush has connections with businessmen all over the country, and primarily in the oil sector.  I do no think this really means anything intellectually but Moore tries to convey the idea that business is bad (see later for more info on this).  As I mentioned earlier all major players in the political arena have contacts in large corporations so I really do not understand the significance of this being a bad thing.  Moore showed a video image of Ben Affleck standing behind Al Gore at a rally, but apparantly it does not matter that Gore was hanging out with Hollywood elite however Bush hanging out with them evil businessmen is a bad thing.
<br />

<br />
Then a bunch of mumbo jumbo about Bush being connected via business ties with the Saudis and possibly the Bin Laden family.
<br />

<br />
Moving on, Moore really hit on the fact that Bush was at a school reading a book with kids when the World Trade Centers were attacked.  Bush stayed in the classroom for approx 7 minutes.  Those 7 minutes, Moore just totally berates Bush for being incompotent and worthless.  I personally feel that Bush continuing in that classroom was the best thing he could do.  I think if he was seen on camera as quickly getting up and leaving it would cause a big stir and make people even more afraid.  Also, and more importantly, command and control procedures were already in affect as cited by the 9/11 Commission; a nice factoid that Moore omits.
<br />

<br />
Just to mention something right quick, Moore is for the most part striclty one sided however there were a very few times that he did show both sides of the picture but only when it benefited his agenda.  Case in point he was smack talking about the Patriot Act and the worthless Republicans who passed it but he also talked @#%$ about Democrats who went along with it.  So this was one of the few times that Moore did attack the democrats.
<br />

<br />
He interviewed some soldiers in Iraq, or rather he had somebody do it, not sure if it was indeed him.  Anyhow, it was pretty straightforward but I think he wanted to give you the impression that it was nothing but bad news over there.  The obvious things were like some young soldiers just feeling torn up when they had to kill people and saw others getting killed; geez figure that.
<br />

<br />
One portion of the movie that I just did not understand how it could be a bad thing was in reference to businesses rebuilding Iraq.  Moore showed some contractor seminar type thing for contractors and subcontractors to score business deals and some people said outright that there is a lot of potential money to be made in Iraq.
<br />
I was thinking, "Well, duh yeah there is."  Moore is obviously a major anti-business type person but yet the facts he presented really were nothing out of the ordinary.    You expect that companies would be fighting for the lucrative reconstruction deals.  It is like on one hand he was trying to say how evil these companies are for wanting to make money in Iraq but on the other hand you can not expect the US military to go into Iraq, blow the @#%$ out of everything and just leave without a reconstruction plan.
<br />

<br />
As I am sure many people have heard Michael Moore attempted to convince a hanful of congressmen and women to have their kids enlist in the military.  Moore, though, chose his words very carefuly; he said that only one congressman had an enlisted son in Iraq.
<br />
Moore loves to misrepresent any numbers he can and I think this was a fine example. 
<br />
First off he specifically mentions Iraq.  So if a congressman has a child in Afghanistan, Bosnia, or anywhere else it does not count.  The only military service that matters is Iraq - according to Moore.  Also he does not mention any children that may be officers in the military.  I am just taking a guess here but if  person has a parent who is a member of congress, more than likely if they are in the military they have secured some sort of commission.  It would not suprise me at all that there are very few enlisted chilredn of conressmen/women.  However, I would wager there is a significant amount whom are officers.
<br />

<br />
Moore finds a mother whose son was killed in Iraq, and I am sure he was happy as can be when he found her.  I think he played her as well as he could to get her to say exactly what he wanted to hear.  Moore really should be embarrassed of himself, but what can you expect.
<br />

<br />
Moore did show some pretty funny stuff such as some assclown that invted a parachute for people that worked in buildings.  The guy stated that it can be put on in 30 seconds but his modelling person couldn't get the damn thing on and something didn't work right but he said "Oh don't worry about that."  He did a Bonanza parody with Afghanistan that was rather funny as well as a coalition of the willing skit that showed a bunch of %@$# backwards countries that supported the US.  I was entertained.
<br />

<br />
Anyhow in summary if somebody who already was a way left liberal watched this movie I think they would love this.  My friend that I saw this with, I would classify as a boderline democrat/republican.  He is a perfect example of somebody who is on the fence.  He found the movie to a bit much of liberal propoganda.  
<br />
Judging his response and my opinion, I think if you fell in the middle and then all the way to the right in the political spectrum you would find this movie to be a blasphemy.  One would have to be a real liberal leftist to actually take this movie seriously.
<br />

<br />
I also think, though, in order to be intellectually honest with oneself this movie should be seen by everybody so they can form their own opinion.<br />

<br />
Given the mood at the time, I think the only thing he could have done to make it worse would have been to run around the classroom flapping his arms and screaming. 7 minutes sitting there was 7 minutes of indecision...that's time to ground the airplanes which might have done something to avert the hit on the pentagon...I'm fuzzy on the precise timeline there, but you never know. Ask a paramedic if 7 minutes makes a difference to someone having a heart attack.
<br />

<br />
In or around the 1st year anniversay, NBC did a timeline episode that chronicled all of the events up to the collapse of the second tower, starting with when the terrorists boarded the planes. It's obviously been a while since I've seen the thing, but I remember a reference to an air force fighter being able to intercept the second WTC airplane, but not having orders to do so. Would the 7 minutes have mattered? Probably not; I also have a recollection that the plane was in upstate New York, and wasn't in range...but again, 7 minutes wasted in a crisis is a pretty huge screwup.

Well, bear in mind that the film was done filming and in post-production when the commission report came out, IIRC. Hard to include information he didn't have.

I was an air traffic controller for 11 years and had friends still working in the agency on the day of the tragedy.  Grounding the airplanes began the instant the second airplane hit the WTC.  The Newark tower chief, who watched it happen out his cab windows, called the Eastern Regional office of the FAA and was connected to FAA-002 (Jane Garvey's deputy - forget the name) and told them what he had seen and that man instantly called all 21 en route centers and ordered them to ground all traffic.  It was unprecedented -- never been done and the FAA had no plan in place to ever do it, but they accomplished it in under 4 hours which was an incredible achievement.  The point is, by the time Bush had the news, the FAA was already doing it.  The president could have reversed the decision, but the folks in the FAA take responsibility for safe skies extremely seriously and were acting on the news before Bush even heard it.<br />

				Saying there was 7 minutes of indecision is not fair.  The presidents job is not puppet master.  He is not pulling the strings on every little detail of government.  He sets up agencies and gives them missions and a good leader expects his people to carry out that mission using their expert skills.
<br />

<br />
In 7 minutes Bush did not know what he was dealing with, and not knowing he did the right thing and waited for intel and info.  He kept a calm head and continued doing his job.  When the situation became clear enough that he needed to step in, he did.

				Yeah, that whole fighter plane thing is a bit retarded in the first place.
<br />
Whether or not a fighter was in range of any of those 4 jets doesn't matter. Until that day, we had never faced people intentionally flying planes into buildings like that. Bush wouldn't have ordered fighters to shoot down those airliners if he had the chance. And if he did have that chance, the fact none were shot down is proof that he wouldn't.
<br />
Hell, even if he did, the 3 planes that reached their targets were over populated areas. Do you really believe shooting a 737 down over a populated area would have been less disasterous then what actually happened? Do you think the president would have been in any better shape in peoples eyes if he killed 3 thousand people blowing up a plane over NYC Vs. it running into the tower? Would the 9/11 commision be kissing his %@$# for his actions, or would they be grilling his %@$# for shooting down a plane that could have potentially not hit its target?
<br />
It is all woulda coulda shoulda. Amazing how well you can see with hindsight. We know what happened, so they ask what coulda happened if. IF we did what the alternate scenario says we could have done, they would then instead ask why they did that instead of waiting it out and seeing what coulda happened instead.<br />

				Well, I saw the movie yesterday. My conclusion is that Michael Moore would make a good propogandist.  Oh hang on, he is...
<br />

<br />
His analysis is very bad. He makes assumptions that because one ideology or analysis is wrong his must be correct. He jumps from, 'this is wrong - so this is right' without supporting either statement or conceding that there may be a third (or fourth, or twelth) possibility. Second, he relies on emotional response rather than information and analysis. Moore presents a position he disagrees with and fills it with music, visuals, and anecdotes that provoke a negative reaction. He then presents his alternative and gives it a warm fluffly feeling. So, rather than analysis the audience is left with emotions attatched to assumptions. A positive emotional attatchment makes Moore's assumption more appealing.
<br />

<br />
There are some positives to the show. First, it is entertaining. Second, it is interesting watching the reaction of a Canadian audience to a piece that opposes US foreign policy. If this were a representative group (which I agree it isn't) I would say that the world doesn't know wether to laugh at or weep for the USA. Last, the film does present some interesting questions and possibilities. It completely fails to provide any facts or analysis but gives you something to look into yourself.
<br />

<br />
In short, 
<br />
Not something you would put on your own reference page. 
<br />
Not something that could be called, by any stretch of the imagination, a documentary. 
<br />
How the hell did it win an award? I can only think that France's opinion of the USA contributed to this.
<br />
A brilliant piece of propoganda. But the audience is smarter than Moore gives them credit for.
<br />
Some interesting questions are presented but no serious attempt is being made at answering them.
<br />

<br />
If you see it just remember that Moor is presenting a piece of propoganda that is furthering his opinion and agenda. And above all, think for yourself dammit!<br />

				I hate to make the thread dull but I mostly agree with you Poppa. This is not a statement that the attack should or could have been prevented. However, it does suggest that perhaps more could have been done. And if more was done maybe (and it is a big maybe) the attack could have been prevented. But you are right, there was no way to predict such a thing. Also, the perhaps and maybes are too big to make a conclusive statement about prevention. What I got from it was that if more was done, even though the attack could not have been predicted, the USA may have gotten lucky and prevented it.
<br />

<br />
I think that there is a real important point to be made in this kind of debate. Regardless of wether you feel you were let down by your government or not (that's not for me - a non American  - to say) the blame belongs to no one but the people who committed or aided the action. I hate metaphors but the hour and the absinthe leaves me limited... - If someone attacks you, you don't blame the police for not being all knowing, all seeing, lacking powers of augury, and therefore being absent during the event. Sure, maybe they could have done more but the fault lies with the people who chose the action and not with the people who, unless they were willingly negligent, failed to protect you.

				One bit to add to the Micheal Moore thing.
<br />

<br />
I think that Moore's movie was entertaining and raised some interesting points and questions that are worth a good look at. I  also think that the war on Iraq was illegal and immoral. I think that a number of nations now have a moral obligation to protect and rebuild Iraq because of their mistake. Now for OneFatRat's benefit... <span style="font-weight: bold">The Point</span> - Even though some of my thoughts on the war with Iraq coincide with Moore's I'd be damned embarassed to have come to those opinions because of viewing his film.
<br />

<br />
Damn, the only person in the whole movie who answered a question straight was Britney Spears. And that just scares me to @#%$.
<br />

<br />
If you are going to say something like Saudi Arabia has invested $x in the USA and this represents x% of the GNP is it too much to @#%$ ask that you flash us some names and numbers? W're not stupid - go for it - put a little faith in the herds of sheep watching your film. Even if you bore us with a few minutes of actual facts we'll still give you $10 to see the film.
<br />

<br />
Now for all you good little Ernesto (that's Che to all you clique folks who don't know who he is but wear his face on your chest because you think it's cool - even though by wearing his t-shirt you support what he fought against) wannabes go watch a real rant. Go see (or - gasp- read) <a href="http://www.thecorporation.tv/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Corporation</span>.</a>It's got 9/11, it's got Michael Moore, it's got Noam Chomsky (bah you can ignore that hack <img src="images/smiles/wink.gif" alt="wink" border="0" /> )
<br />

<br />
Hey, I got to rant at the left while recomending an anti-capitalist book. Everyone flame me! I take my drink and a book to bed now.  Night night all.  <img src="images/smiles/smile.gif" alt="smile" border="0" /><br />
