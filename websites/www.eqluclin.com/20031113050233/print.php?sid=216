<font class="print-normal">Our EZboard home only had 3 days of Gold Status left on it, and it appeared to have disappeared completely (it's back now apparently, maybe it was just coincidence). But advertising thier &quot;FREE GOLD!&quot; offer by having one of their admins posted about in our PRIVATE and PASSWORDED admin forum didn't fly over well with our mods. Also, after paying for gold status as long as we have been, we weren't going to ask the community to shell out another $400+ dollars to keep the gold status there, especially when EZboard's sdemello(sysop) user had been interfering in posts that didn't even appear to break EZboard's TOS. Being moved to different pub (server) recently that appeared to all to be MUCH slower was basically the final straw. <br>
<br>
Without further delay, for those who are surfing around trying to find the new boards, you can find them <b><a href="http://www.eqluclin.com/forums">here</a></b>.<br>
<br>
Everyone be sure to give <b>Tymmon</b> and <b>Ealdayen</b> a huge round of applause and thanks on this one. Ealdayen believes he can continue hosting the forums for free (just as he's been doing with EqLuclin.com all along), and Tymmon has been a machine getting the new forums ready so that we can get away from EZboards, having to pay for them and put up with various issues regarding them. A mass e-mail to all 900+ registered EqLuclin users is incoming in regards to all of this.<br>
<br>
And thus we continue to adapt to adversity at the speed of light... Another chapter in the history of the Luclin community begins...<br /><br />
