				<td colspan="2"><div class="postbody">Something has been on my mind for a few years now, and...sadly there is no way to fix it, and no way to go back to what it used to be.
<br />

<br />
This issue is the interactions between the sexes.  Each year it seems to get colder between "us" and "them".   Many laugh at "sexes jokes"  I do myself at times, when it is in good taste, because, let's face it, we will always be different in our own "special" ways, and that was good.  We got along until the sexual revolution and women's liberation.
<br />

<br />
I don't want to pretend that getting some rights were not warranted, but i don't think we, and by we I don't mean me, I mean they, needed to go as far as they went and continue to go.
<br />

<br />
Mean women are ruining it for the rest of us who want to have doors opened for us and like to be and feel "protected" and are perfectly happy staying home with a child.......and that is an issue that requires a discussion all itsself, b/c growing up in day care is wrong if you ask me.  Stay at home mothers refer to themselves as "I'm just a stay at home mom" with a sigh, as if they are worthless to our society, and that is so sad to me.
<br />

<br />
In my opinion couples (meaning both get credit for the decision) that make the sacrifices so that one of the parents is a full time parent are worth their weight in diamonds.  Not to be "almost" frowned upon as not "pulling their weight"
<br />

<br />
Can we go back to when women were adored and "my fair ladies"  and fussed over.....not joining the military, and then being ridiculed for this and that, or being remarked as "if she were not a woman it would have been different"
<br />

<br />
If we can't go back to the 1950s can we at least quit trying to discredit those women who do succeed by saying that we only did because we are female?  I bet you that the majority of men want martha Steward to fry, not for the possibility that she is guilty, but for simply being a woman.  It's like men hate all women except their girlfriend/wife and their mom/sisters, and it's the vice versa for women hating men.
<br />

<br />
men don't want their women to be equal to them, it's a sheer testosterone thing, and frankly i don't want the responsibilities of a man's, I am happy to be unequal.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
.....I just wish we could go back to the 50s because I really don't like 2003
<br />

<br />

<br />
Some men do like stupid obsequious women.  Those women usually propagate to those men.  Ever notice how the same people always get into crappy relationships?  I've dated quite a few women and I've managed to remain friends with almost all of them.  They're generally very smart, very attractive physically and independent women.  The girl I'm with now is all that also, and those are the type I'm attracted to.
<br />

<br />
Men and women are clearly different but I don't think either sex has changed.  One time I held a door for a person that happened to be a woman.  She commented "I can get my own door", my response was, "you must be out of your @#%$ mind!".  She didn't have a comment for that.
<br />

<br />
The women's right movement was about having a mutual respect.  If you have respect for someone it doesn't matter what you do it cannot be wrong.  Equality in the sexes and races may never exist truly but we can learn to respect each other as equals and I, for one, see no harm in it.  I can still open the car door for my girlfriend without thinking she's incapable of doing it for herself.<span class="gensmall"></span>

				<td colspan="2"><div class="postbody">In the constitution, the words <span style="font-style: italic">people</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">person</span> appear a few times. In our more modern, enlightened times, we see those words and include women and colored people in the meanings of <span style="font-style: italic">people</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">person</span>. Throughout the history of the USA, that was not always the case. Perhaps the most infamous case in the history of the USA was the Dred Scott decision. Boiled down into one sentence, it said that negroes were not people. There was no single case I could point out that said anything similar about women. Basically, the civil rights movement can be boiled down to <span style="font-style: italic">negroes are people too</span>. And the central issue of feminism is that <span style="font-style: italic">women are people too</span>. Many folks like to complain about feminism, for all sorts of ideological reasons, but at the central core of their being, they do not believe that women are people. One cannot be an idol to worship, and be a person too. 
<br />

<br />
Working families? That is how families have been through out history: everyone worked, and the grandparents usually took care of the kids during the day. When the children got to be 5-6ish, they were expected to help out in the fields or the factory. In the early part of the Industrial Revolution, some of the wealthier men decided on trophy wives as a way of proclaiming <span style="font-style: italic">I am so wealthy that my wife does not need to work</span>. As the Industrial Revolution proceeded, more and more men did the same: acquire trophy wives (no Lexus or Beemers to show off the size of their wallet back then). One of the issues that unions pushed for in the early 20th century was for a <span style="font-style: italic">living wage</span>. A living wage was one in which the man/husband was paid enough that his wife would not have to work. Some people like to point to Ford Motor Company and its $5 a day wage for workers, but there were a lot of conditions that you had to comply with to get that salary (otherwise you were paid more like $2 per day), being married and going to church several times a week were among them.
<br />

<br />
The legal rights of women are getting better, far better than in the 1950s, where you could be fired if you got married. And you would certainly be fired for getting pregnant. I am old enough to remember the classified ads having categories <span style="font-style: italic">Help Wanted - Male</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">Help Wanted - Female</span>. I am old enough to remember restaurants with signs that said <span style="font-style: italic">Whites only</span>. For women's rights, Ireland in the 1970s was much like the US in the 1950s. One of the things that happened during that time in Ireland was a law was passed allowing married women to inherit property. Sounds strange, but when a woman married a man, she stopped being a person under the law: could not testify without husband approval, could not enter into contracts, and could not inherit property. Who gets the house when the husband dies? Not the wife, she cannot inherit. What if the children of that marriage (or relatives of the husband, if there are no children) decide that they want to sell the house, and do not want to support the mother? OMG, a scandal for the newspapers.
<br />

<br />
Nostalgia for the 1950s is bizaare to watch. It was a period when women used more mind altering drugs than at any previous time in American history. I am not certain that the drug usage in the 1960s was out of line: children were behaving like their parents (what you are doing is so loud, I cannot hear what you are saying). Various MAO inhibitors got prescribed by the bucket full for depression. And the benzodiazepines (valium class of drugs) were developed to cut down on the side effects. Next time you look at an advertisement for a drug on TV, look at how the weasel words almost always say something about MAO inhibitors. Women were getting depressed because there was nothing to do after they were sentenced to imprisonment in suburbia. 
<br />

<br />
Why did women have to go back to work in the 1970s? Because that is when the standard of living in the USA started declining for the average person. Whatever you want to blame it on is irrelevant, the actual standard of living went down. Most adult women of the time look back at it as the time they had to start pumping their own gas. And the having to pump their own gas was not relevant, nor important, but it was a personal landmark. 
<br />

<br />
And the people who want Martha Stewart to fry, hate her because she is an ass. The goody-two-shoes act she displays is an act. She is more of a control freak than pretty much all the women you have ever met. If you ever had to deal with her, or her company, you would volunteer to pull the lever. Think of her as Donald Trump in drag and you will start getting close.
<br />

<br />
I worked with a woman who punched men who held doors open for her (some of the guys went out of their way to hold doors for her as a form of teasing). When I asked her, she put it simply as she did not want men controlling how and where she could go. Next time you look at some custom, try looking at it as a control mechanism. Who benefits? Who is controlled? What happens to the uppity one who steps out of line? 
<br />

<br />
Childhood is byproduct of the Industrial Revolution. Women that don't work is another byproduct of the Industrial Revolution. Neither are <span style="font-style: italic">natural</span>. And it is possible to find contemporary societies where neither childhood (as it is known in America) nor home-makers exist.
<br />

<br />
Nostalgia is selective amnesia.<span class="gensmall"></span>

If women want to play on an even playing field, then they should have to abide by the same rules that men do.

Yes, open the door for me, and I will say thank you and give you a big smile. 
<br />
If I get to the door first, I will open it for you, even if you are a man and I would appreciate a thank you as well.
<br />
If you drop something, I will offer to help you pick it up. It is called common courtesy.
<br />
I am an attractive, independant woman, and I have a man who appreciates me, protects me, and makes me feel very special. I don't think we have to go back a couple generations in order to have these sorts of relationships. 
<br />
Women's "rights" and common courtesy have somehow become synonymous. 
<br />

<br />
On a related note.........
<br />
Since the creation of this country, I guarantee that presidents have been getting a little somethin' somethin' on the side. But it was part of their private lives, so it stayed private. Some with sports figures--baseball players in the twenties and thirties were HEROES. Yes, they probably had their dalliances, drinking, fights, etc, but they weren't lambasted for it. Today, the second your name become known to the general public, every mistake/misquote/misstep is spun into headlines. Why should these mistakes discredit your other accomplishments??
<br />
I know I am veering from topic to topic, but this touches a lot of areas that I feel strongly about.
<br />

<br />
Stop denying us our heroes. Let their accomplishments speak for themselves. Let their private lives stay private. Because someone did something stupid with some chick does not negate their amazing prowess on the basketball court, nor does it negate some great policy decision they have made in running our country.
<br />

<br />
You want to criticize their skill or job decisions, go for it!! Have at it! But let's keep some perspective here. In my opinion, there would be no reason that anyone should want to go into politics. There is zero respect for those positions anymore, and all you do is open up your private life to the press of the world. It's not worth it.

Boatload of jobs, but you have to use some brain power and think about it.
<br />

<br />
Aircraft pilots have minimum standing and seating heights.  Many law enforcement organization have minimums, as well as firefighters.  The US military has minimum requirments.  Modeling agencies do.  Some of those have to deal with the equipment; a pilot may not physically be able to sit in the seat if they are too short, the respirator and tank of a firefighter may not physically fit a smaller person.  I know for a fact that the FBI (and I imagine other law enforcement agencies) have minimal requirements - else it would be putting somebody into unnecessary danger if you had a person that was not physical enough to take down a suspect.
<br />

<br />
Your point about height just proves how people want different standard yet want to be on a the same playing field.  If there is some job restriction due to height, say 5'6" as you mention, then that applies to *gasp* men as well.  Not just women.  If a woman can do it and meets the minimum requirements, well hot damn, more power to her and I am happy for her.  However, if she can't then she probably has no business in that career field.
<br />

<br />
And, guess what?
<br />
That goes for a man as well.<span class="gensmall"></span>

<br />
Since firefighters are a common example lets start there. You must carry a rolled firehose around, and prove you can handle it under full pressure, drag/firemen's carry people down stairs or away from buildings, have the strength and stamina to handle a full fire suit and breathing apparatus(This adds alot of weight). 
<br />
These are just a small few of the many requirements put on firefighters in their minimum standards. The problem of changing these requirements for lighter weight, less strength needed, etc. is that these things dont change. Until new/better equipment is made they dont have a lighter fire hose or lower pressure going through it. The fire suit and breathing gear isn't any lighter. The requirements can't be any less for particular people, becuase when it comes to the job, the people they are saving aren't going to weigh less because a female is coming to save them. They make the requirements, because that is what they need to do their job safely and effectively.
<br />
As far as Daari wanting to go back to the 50s, I am thinking the same as some others. Daari wants to see teh same respect, love, freindlyness that is today portraid as what the 50s were like. Wouldnt it be nice for many things to go back to that, like the worlds population and the types of cars? Yes, the extreme femi groups are causing more problems then they are fixing anymore, it is that way with any extreme rights group today. Look at alot of what animal rights groups do, or many of the fights Naacp likes to pick and choose from. Just one more thing that needs to change before people can be seen and treated as an equal.<span class="gensmall"></span>

In the military women complain CONSTANTLY about sexual harassment, special sources for them to get promoted, Equal Opportunity, etc,

Yet when they are attatched to a combat-possible unit, they freak out, deny the orders, go to court martial, cry, etc...

Do you even realize how many women got pregnant so they wouldn't get deployed to Iraq? I can count 7 in my unit alone, "Oh you happened to get pregnant when you found out we were going to war?"
<br />

<br />
If women want equal rights, then they get @#%$ equal rights. Women consider themselves 100% equal, yet their PFT (Physical Fitness Test) is WAY easier, and a larger percentage of women score 1st class than men. They should have to run the same test we do, since its preparing you for COMBAT fitness, not bullshit desk jobs. Women want the benefits, and none of the hardships, at least in the Military.

<br />

<br />
I think some jobs should go to the most physically able person when that job is mostly pyhsically demanding.  For example: a firefighter.  If the person applying for the job cannot carry/drag a required amount they should not get the job.  I've known some female firefighters who were more than able.
<br />

<br />
Perhaps in the military there is a requirement to be physically strong for some reason.  Clearly not everyone can do that job.  It would probably be easier for a man, on average, to pass a generalized strength test.
<br />

<br />
You've proven by your comments just how sexist the military is Deris.  Perhaps the women were going to war and had a really good 2 weeks of shagging before hand.  They got pregnant.  You, and your fellow jarheads, assume the women did it on purpose because they're cowards.
<br />

<br />
You didn't actually respect the women enough to presume it was just poor timing.  The military to you is still a man's world.  I think you'd agree with the author of this message that you'd enjoy living in the 1950's cause that's where your mind is at, perhaps.  I know you'll come back and defend all your actions quoting your deeds of equality and equanimity when faced with women's issues.  You're still at heart a chauvinist.  It's like a racist calling everyone a "nig_ger" then coming back and saying, "but I have black friends".
<br />

Umm why the @#%$ did I need to do that to the "N" word?  I got I_AM_RACIST_BANME.  How about taking out those stupid @#%$ rules so we can actually say what we want to say?<span class="gensmall"></span>

I mean, hell as you fully understand, when it actually comes to being in a combat position the artillary flying overhead does not give a damn if you are a man or woman.  It does not give women an extra 10 second head start to hit the deck.
<br />

<br />
One of my best friends was up in Monterey at DFLI (Chair Force element) and he was telling me even up there at this pussy beach-side easy going tech schoo,l chicks were getting pregnant left and right.  He personally thinks the Navy girls are the worse at it - worse meaning more of them get pregnant compared to other services.
<br />

<br />
In a way I think the military has been, and more than likely will always be a "man's world."  And, that is not to be chauvanstic, but there are biology and physiological differences that men are better suited to.  Motherhood will always be a "woman's world" - it is just how things are.  Men perform better under stressful conditions, I was reading a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine a few years back that men can pay attention to different things at one time and keep the details for each 'thing' organized - women have a tendency to jumble the concepts of different situations around.  Men, by and large, are taller, faster, stronger - naturally make better soldiers.  
<br />
All men?  No, I know of a few women that could easily kick my ass and two of them are in the armed forces as officers.  I understand that there are plenty of women like that.  However, per the norm, men are better suited to military life and combat situations.
<br />

<br />
To think otherwise, you are dreaming in some sort of liberalized world that does not look at the simple facts of life.  Idealism, if you would.

To sum up:  boys and girls are different.<span class="gensmall"></span>

When did I mention cowardice? If men don't deploy they get court martialed and possible jail time, since they are refusing a lawful order.

Im not sexist, i just hate women who want equal opportunity, but dont expect to be held to the same expectations. If I have to carry an 80 lbs pack, then she does too. Equal Opportunity has gone too far in this country to where universities and institutions are accepting underqualified personnel to meet their 'quotas' for race and sex.
<br />

<br />
You have to remember, Im supposed to trust every single Marine in combat, no matter of MOS (Job). Every Marine is trained as a Rifleman first and foremost, and if she runs slower, carries a smaller load, etc or ANYONE does for that matter of fact, Guys/Girls, then how the hell am I supposed to entrust my life to them in combat. 
<br />

<br />
And girls don't just all of a sudden 'get pregnant' (some of those girls have had abortions already ,and are normally on birth control!)...
<br />

<br />
Doesnt make sense that the unit had 0 pregnancies for 2 years then all of a sudden 50% of the girls in the unit get pregnant when theres an announcement that we're getting deployed <img src="images/smiles/eek.gif" alt="eek" border="0" />). Cute so cute.

Now, to protect the egos of boys, women and men fire at different distances so that one cannot compare them. There is a lot more to being a soldier than running around with a big backpack. There is a lot more to being a firefighter than playing with big hoses.

Estrogen fuses the parts of bones, stopping them from growing longer, faster than testosterone does. If you can show that height is a valid requirement, then it <span style="font-style: italic">may</span> be OK. In the past, height requirements were used as a sneaky way to discriminate against women. Basing a requirement on a secondary characteristic of sex or race has frequently been used as a work-around to try to discriminate on the sex or race. Sex and race are treated as <span style="font-style: italic">suspect classifications</span> by courts (look up the phrase in some legal dictionary, it means something different from what you may first think it does). Can height be a legitimate requirement or not? History shows it has not been legitimate. Most people are very skeptical about height requirements.

Women getting knocked up when it is getting close to combat deployment? You only notice it then. You don't care about it happening any other time, so it becomes invisible.<span class="gensmall"></span>

This was straight from my OIC who is a woman <img src="images/smiles/badrazz.gif" alt="badrazz" border="0" />, that 7 girls got pregnant when she announced that we were deploying, and NONE have in 2 years past.
<br />

<br />
And yes, theres more to carrying a pack in combat, like carrying a fallen soldier 3 miles, pushing a humvee when its stuck, carrying the extra ammo the squad needs, being able to handle killing people, blah blah..
<br />

<br />
Too many things to risk in my eyes...I'm sure theres females out there better at soldiering than I am, but they will be few and far between..<span class="gensmall"></span>
