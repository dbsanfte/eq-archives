				Elbrich,
<br />

<br />
The fact that the US had aided both Iran and Iraq while they warred is well known and documented especially in the Woodward story.  The cold war was on.  Europe needed oil going to market and the Soviets were pressing down on the Middle East threatening to remove the worlds primary supply from the market.
<br />

<br />
The entire region was a fracture zone.
<br />

<br />
It was the duty of NATO to do what it could to make sure that there was no conclusive winner between the two.  If there was, the winner would certainly send their armies into Saudi and Kuwait.  Then the Soviets would either roll in to assist or roll over the rear of the agressor depending on who it was.
<br />

<br />
As it turns out, Sadam was the clear winner and he did turn his armies towards Saudi and occupied all of Kuwait.  The Soviets were already teetering internally. The extension of the war between Iran and Iraq lasted long enough that the Soviet Union was not able to interfere when Iran lost.  Had it happened a couple years earlier...
<br />

<br />
Nice job on lying though your [shazaar23]* to villify the US though.  You have not provided any evidence that the US Helped Sadam use chemical weapons nor any violence against civilians.  One of your refeneces doesnt even come up. Neither of rest allude to this reprehensible falsification.  
<br />

<br />
You have taken some small fact known for 20 years and well justified in the face of the disaster to Europe it deflected; And, you are heaping slander on it hoping that it will give your absurd arguements some validity.
<br />

<br />
Having traded with Sadam does not make the US complicant in his acts of terror (if we in fact did. The only source I give any validity to in your post is the Woodward article, even he has a chip on his shoulder as he tries to find one more deep throat... just one more...).  Sadam is the one that used nerve gas on civilians. No amount of warping of truth and fabrication of lies from you is going to change that.
<br />

<br />
What small truths that remain in your point do NOT stop we Americans from recoiling from what Sadam has done with horror.  How can you even suggest such a thing?
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
This is a disgusting display:

<br />

<br />
Like we are ghouls hoping that Shiites would be slaughtered.  We didn't finish off Sadam after Kuwait because your favorite teet to suck on, the UN, and the rallies of people using identical propoganda as you are now, bound the US's hands.
<br />

<br />
"We will help but only to remove him from Kuwait and put pressure on him economicly." was what the UN and especially Canada in effect declared.  YOU Elberich, with your arguements and slanderous style are the very voice and personification of those who are responsible for the death of those Shiites.  Their blood is on your allegorically personified hands not on US leadership's, theirs were bound by you.
<br />

<br />
Back then I bound those hands as well.  I had hoped that pressure would bring change.  To insinuate that I or any other american were want to see civilians killed is insane.  Did the Shiite connection to Iran weigh in at all in Clintons decision not to follow up on the call that Bush had made?  It may have been considered but I think that the voices of people like you and me were more well considered.  The connection of Iraqi Shiites to Iranian Shiites could have been nothign more than considered trivia in light of all the other factors that bound Bush's and Clintons from acting.
<br />

<br />
That Shiite blood on your hands is on my hands as well for vocally resisting the removal of Sadam in 1992.  Bush1 had wanted to remove Sadam right there and then and called on Shiites to help.  With the best of intentions, people like you and I, like cowards, turned our backs on an oppressed people rising up against an evil dictator hoping in vain that the people of the West had the same backbone as their leaders.
<br />

<br />
I, for one, could no longer hope for a peaceful resolution with Sadam after what he did following his outing from Kuwait.  I'm suprised you could.
<br />

<br />
The "give peace a chance" chant was a green light to this monster to murder civilians wholesale.
<br />

<br />
9/11 may have never happened if 13 or so years ago we as a world united had made an example of Hussien and had a presence in Iraq to expose and divide terrorist networks.  The only way to travel from Saudi or Jordan to Iran or Afghanistan is through Iraq.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
There are many nations that the US has sold munitions to and provided intellegence to that have not used them against civilians... including Canada. Sadam proved himself unable to be trusted with the responsibility.  That is part of what made him a present danger to the US.  It is the defining trait of his character that makes him a terrorist.  He <span style="font-weight: bold">used</span> them.
<br />

<br />
Your point does little but reinforce the fact that the US had accurately identified Saddam as a threat early on and had made prudent decisions to delay the inevitable as long as possible.
<br />

<br />
Sadam trained terrorists.
<br />

<br />
 
<br />
You don't?
<br />

<br />
Who is the "we" you are referring to? You do not have the proxy nor rights to speak for anyone but yourself as far as your moral decisions go.
<br />

<br />
I certainly condemn all acts of terror against civilians even by government agencies including here in the US.  We keep our dogs on a pretty short leash.
<br />

<br />
The US as a nation does not have the right to make that judgement <span style="font-weight: bold">except when that amoral behavior is directed towards us or our allies</span>.  Then it become a VERY compelling reason to move forward with great purpose and resolve in order to smash the living [bicrius] out of that [shazar23]hole. First with pressure then with force if pressure fails or meets with violence as on 9/11.
<br />

<br />
Sadam was training terrorists and he was justifying the use of terror against the US.  Is that not enough? For myself, the later (and undisputed as fact) point is enough. Does this not constitute enough for me to say to myself, "This guy is a real and persistant threat to me as a terrorist."
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
It is clear that you have given up on trying to argue that Sadam was not training terrorists.  He was even if they were just... um... sanctioned (not uniformed) and "primarily" domestic.
<br />

<br />
Are these two together not enough for the US to regard Sadam as a clear and present danger?
<br />

<br />
I am not asking what you would do if you were president.
<br />

<br />
I am not asking for your foetid exhortations on how Americans don't get to "cry" about Sadam since they gave him munitions and intelligence once upon a time.
<br />

<br />
I am not asking for you avoid the point by trapping the US in poorly facaded quixotic moral dillemmas that wind up killing hundreds of thousands with misplaced peace rhetoric.
<br />

<br />
I am not asking for you regress to a prosimian state and start flinging feces when in a poor position... Matter of fact... I am likely to demand some sort of gentlemanly resolution if you ever suggest that the US wanted to kill civilians like the Shiites again just to avoid a direct answer.
<br />

<br />
(12 bottles of Guiness at 13 paces sir.)
<br />

<br />
What I am asking is this:
<br />

<br />
If I interpret Sadam's letter as a justification of terrorism on the US... 
<br />

<br />
(You have stopped short of saying that this is not a valid conclusion though not your own.)
<br />

<br />
If I also believe that he was morally capable of commiting attrocities against civilians specificly in a terrorist fashion and know that he is presently equipped with terrorist means and is possibly preparing the worst...
<br />

<br />
(You have completely dodged the point and I can only conclude that is your acquiescence that he was capable and had trained his people in a very significant ways in terrorist strategies.)
<br />

<br />
Are these two views not enough, from a rational perspective, to have considered Sadam to be a clear and present danger to the US?
<br />

I think you misunderstand me.  I'm not crusifying the USA in its entirety. I'm not even saying the USA's foreign policy is entirely wrong.  I criticise  the hypocracy, lies, and moral relativism of any nation's foreign policy.  As for the UN...

As the situation became steadily graver, international concern mounted. In July the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 598, calling for both sides to stop fighting, withdraw to the prewar border, and submit to an international body to determine responsibility for the war. Iraq seized on the resolution, but Iran refused to end hostilities with victory so near. Iran continued its attacks but did not achieve the victory for which it had hoped.
<br />

<br />
By 1988 Iraq, sufficiently rearmed and regrouped, drove the Iranians out of Al F&#257;w and several other border areas. Iran was in no position to launch a counterattack, and the international situation seemed increasingly favorable to Iraq. Many Iranian leaders concluded that the war could not be won and worked to persuade Khomeini to accept Resolution 598. Although the resolution failed to provide key Iranian aims—such as an end to Hussein’s government, payment of reparations, or clear identification of Iraq as the initiator of the war—Khomeini endorsed the cease-fire in July. On August 20, 1988, both sides ceased fighting in accordance with the terms of Resolution 598.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

Elberich,
<br />

<br />
I think that what is significantly different between your view and my own regarding the UN is that you would like to see it stronger, I am ready to chuck it out the window.
<br />

<br />
The US never ratified the Hague for instance because frankly our government would need to change our constitution to do so.  I do not want another level of government over me.  I do not need it. I do not desire it.  Matter of fact it is a little repugnant to me to even consider it.
<br />

<br />
I am a free man. Making the UN a real governemnt power would make me a slave.
<br />

<br />
You would want the sovereignty of all nations brought to naught.<br />

Because the ICC Statute has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute only individuals, not governments, long standing principles of criminal law influence how the Court will work. One of those principles is that an individual of any nationality who commits a crime on a state's territory can be prosecuted by that state -- without the consent of his or her respective government. 
<br />
American citizens are frequently prosecuted in the courts of foreign countries for crimes they are alleged to have committed on foreign territory, without any requirement to obtain US consent for those prosecutions. US courts likewise prosecute foreign nationals who allegedly commit crimes on US territory without seeking the consent of their home state. 
<br />

<br />
By ratifying the ICC Statute or signing a declaration for ICC jurisdiction in a particular situation, a state delegates to the ICC its existing and continuing right under international law, and its own domestic law, to investigate, and if warranted, prosecute, any individual of any nationality who is alleged to have committed an atrocity crime on its territory. This legal power over the foreign national exists regardless of the consent or interests of his or her government. Legal arguments disputing this application of international criminal law have not proven convincing to most governments. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
And as for the jury issue
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">In the negotiations, the US accepted the absence of jury trial because civil law systems, which formed the large majority of states negotiating the ICC Statute, do not have jury trials and because it actually is extremely impractical to empanel a jury of peers from the international community to pass judgment on the crimes and defendants of the ICC. Indeed, just as the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda rely on panels of experienced judges, so too would the ICC require the expertise and integrity of judges to examine these complex crimes. Any potential American defendant, as unlikely as that might be, would doubtless prefer expert judges to rule on his or her conduct than a cross-section of foreign nationals drawn from around the world. There is a real difference between an international trial and a domestic trial for these purposes. 
<br />

<br />
In any event, US service members do not enjoy a constitutional right to jury trial under US law. Also, pursuant to the many extradition treaties to which the US is a party, the US may, and occasionally does, extradite a US citizen to foreign courts that lack the right to jury trial and other due process rights. The ICC's procedures are more analogous to US law than perhaps any other state's legal system, so it would be more advantageous for an American citizen to be tried before the ICC, if that unlikely event ever were to occur, than in most foreign courts. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
There have been a lot of accusations that the objections by the USA and the compromises it has brought to the ICC have weakened the ICC.  However, if you look at them they have actually made it a stronger body.  Even thought the USA is bailing on it, they deserve a lot of credit for helping improve the ICC.<br />

				Elb,
<br />

<br />
You should check carefully what your own sources say.
<br />

<br />
While formulating my opinon, I also read the socialist globalization propoganda that you refer to.  Let me point out how their arguements, since you do not have any of your own yet, fail and in some cases are tricks of wording to make you think that it is something that it is not.
<br />

<br />
The big lie in every site I ran into that was por ratification made this outright lie in exactly the same way:
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">The US claims that the ICC potentially could investigate and try US citizens without US consent even though the US is not a party to the ICC Statute.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
The key words here that are generally missed and obfuscated with misleading healines are: "...even though the US is not a party to the ICC Statute."
<br />

<br />
The ICJ (or ICC or World Court or The Hague or whatever name it is dodging between this week) WOULD have juristiction in the US over US citizens if the US ratified it.  It would supplant the Supreme Court as having authority over US citizens and make them answerable to whatever law the UN wanted to impose this week now that Ghengis Khan or his contemporary counterpart has 2 pocket judges.
<br />

<br />
The ICJ has more binding power over Nations than the UN itself.  Maybe Iraq, Iran and France need an outside court to keep them from commiting genocide. The US does not; Thanks.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
The entire comparison between the ICJ charter and the US Constitution was written specificly to make them seem identical.  They are FAR from it.  The first and most eggrecious of the differences the ICJ has no juries.  But in this comparison there is no mention what-so-ever of this discrepancy and it is HUGE one.
<br />

<br />
Each of those clauses are just words on paper till they are "interpreted".  If the ICJ is ratified by the US, every identical right a US citizen has would be usurped by the World Court and interpretted by them not the Supreme Court.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
Lets say Palastinians wanted to sue Israel over their Wall they were building.  By your sources, this would not be possible because the court would not have authority over governments, just individuals.
<br />

<br />
Well as it turns out this very thing is going on.  Palastinians are asking that the ICJ rule against Israel (who has NOT ratified the court) in addition the court is haering testimony that any allies of Israel also be forced to pay restitution to the people of Palastine.
<br />

<br />
They are asking that the court reccomend sanctions against the US and Israel and that the court rule that the UN security council cannot veto the resolution.
<br />

<br />
It seems even though the US and Israel did not sign the convention, the court is still assuming jurisdiction. The case is pure politicing for influance and it is perfect illustration of just how easy it is to manipulate that court.  No matter how it turns out today, how will that court rule tomarrow?
<br />

<br />
I, for one, do not want my rights as a US citizen decided by judges from Tajikistan and Columbia.<br />

				Flarestar, my short sighted friend, the problem is that what constitutes an "international crime" would one day soon be decided by the likes of Sadam Hussein and Muamar Khaddafi.
<br />

<br />
It does not take much for someone to make same sex sex an international crime against humanity.  How about being a muslim?  What assurances do we have what will and will not in the future be called international law?  We have none
<br />

<br />
I and the bulk of the world are NOT represented by the UN.  The UN represents govrenments not people.  I sure the hell didnt vote for Colin Powell nor for Kofi Annan. Did you?
<br />

<br />
These people are far removed from me and you.  There is no way in hell they could even dream of representing my interests.  They are highlymotivated by $$ to not only scoff at my intrests but to work against them.
<br />

<br />
The UN is no where near being trustworthy.  I understand and celebrate that we all have our governments at least talking in a forum; That there is a peer diplomacy.  I am NOT comfortable having the "world" writing and enforcing "law".
<br />

				I vote for the judges in my city, county and state.  Other judges are appointed directly by my voted for representitives.  That is direct supervision or one or two degrees of seperation.  The furthest removed are Federal judges as I do not vote for the president directly.

<br />
Tell me flarestar, if you are not just talking out of the side of your neck with no clue what you refer to, how far removed from my vote and decision making are judges in the ICJ?
<br />

<br />
What is the prosecution apparatus like in the ICJ? What oversight, as a Joe-Blo citizen, do I get in censoring or removing corrupt prosecutors?
<br />

<br />
What is the process for enforcement of court decisions?
<br />

<br />
And please, take your time composing a rebuttal.  One liners are great for vaudville comedy acts but in a debate, its like pissing on the floor in a public restroom full of unoccupied urinals.  Its ignorant, rude and in complete contravention to the purpose of where you are.  Be a man and post something that states your opinons and support them.

<br />
IMHO the ICJ was charted specificly to screw the US through political manipulation.  WTF is Vincente Fox doing criticizing US justice in the ICJ when the US has withdrawn from it completely?
<br />

<br />
We are not a signator nor a ratifier, yet the grabbing hands of bankrupt, corrupt, and indolent countries continue to try and use the ICJ to garner leverage against my own country.<br />

Are you speaking of removal politically or socially?  Socially is what I'm referring to.  I vote for the judges here in my city and state also, but as far as representing my interests?  Not hardly.  None of them do, really.  They're far too conservative.  It's an extremely rare person who is similar enough to you to accurately represent your interests, and judges are no exception to that rule.
<br />

<br />
Now politically?  Yes, they're much, much farther removed than judges here in the U.S.

In most of the free world you can also vote with your feet. If the elected governing body is too contradictive to your intrests or beliefs, you pick up up and move to some where where they are more like you.  Right now, there is a lot of variety.  Even in the US though our federal government is becoming very intrusive, cultures and lifestyles vary widely.
<br />

<br />
But with the ICJ having global authority how do you disenfranchise yourself of their decisions if those decisions are uncomfortable or even dangerous to you.
<br />

<br />
A global authority, simply by omnidominium, is a tyrrany.  It can be nothing else no matter how benevolent. What ever laws it enforces will be inescapable by any man.  Can you be certain that this authority will always going to be moral and upstanding?
<br />

<br />
What happens when the world court starts making decisions on population control or food distribution?  Don't smirk, the UN is already active in these areas.
<br />

<br />
The UN programs are passive now.  They have no authority nor liberty except as a global charity.  But that is because historicly the UN has not had coersive authority.
<br />

<br />
To give them coersive authority throws everything out of check. By the laws of human nature and the congeling force of authority those programs WILL one day be enforced by the threat of violence.  The people of the world will have no say what-so-ever in the the UN and the judges of teh ICJ make.
<br />

<br />
Now consider some of the programs of teh UN and imagine them having the ability to enforce their government with violence:
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.un.org/ga/coi/" target="_blank" class="postlink">An "information office" with a charter to establish a new world economic order</a>
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news_e.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">Imagine the US being able to force Mexico to adopt thier communications standard with a world court order</a>
<br />

<br />
Heres your own chart of the UN.  poke around look at the programs teh UN has and imagine what could happen if those authorities could use the threat of force on nations and individuals unchecked.
<br />

<br />

You're assuming the ICJ will automatically be corrupt, dictatorial, and subversive to governments currently in place.  You're also overlooking that the U.N. gets its power from a collective of governments.  If things start getting too disruptive and counterproductive, I doubt they'd just ignore it.
<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I don't like the idea of the ICJ either.  But, I'm not going to go off the deep end about it without some sort of solid reason besides paranoia.

<br />
I also assume that the president is corrupt as well as ANYONE in power.  Thats why we give them a hefty set of checks and balances and apparatus for removing them when they deviate too far from the wishes of those they represent.
<br />

<br />
The UN does NOT represent the people of the world.  It was not made to that.  It was made to be a forum for resolving governmental disputes without usurping soverignty. It was not designed to be a governmental power.  Thus the structure of the entire apparatus is without checks and balances.
<br />

<br />
To give that structure worldwide coersive power is like turning the globe into that island depicted in Lord of the Flies except Rogr has machine guns and flamethrowers.
<br />

<br />
Yes, I assume that the ICJ is now and will in the future be corrupt.  I assume ANYONE in power is or has the potential to be corrupt.  Its pure folly to do otherwise.
<br />

<br />
The ICJ represents the death of democracy worldwide.<br />
