How DARE we fly across the world to ruthlessly hunt down and kill every single Al Qaeda member we can get our hands on, yet on the other hand adamantly refuse to support Israel doing the same within their own internationally recognized borders. This spineless  appeasement foreign policy has got to come to an end. The terrified "oh please dont make them mad, or they will really hurt you!" approach has obviously not worked. The US, Israel, and everyone else in the world are trying to bend over backwards, giving up concession after concession, promising in writing that they will get the land they seek eventually, the only thing we have ever asked is to stop killing Israeli people.
<br />

<br />
After trying this approach through two seperate leaders over many decades (or centuries, take your pick), it is clear that the Palestinian leadership is either unwilling or incapable of stopping their own backyard terrorists. Yes I know the history, I know that at best you would still have to admit that a couple generations ago the Palestinians were unfairly forced out of their homelands, but damn it, I dont care anymore. ANY moral high ground they have had at all is gone now. I no longer care about being historically fair to the Palestinians, and I no longer care one bit about their grievance, they should be considered to have forfeited their side of the negotiations.
<br />

<br />
Israel knows that the US is one of the only friends they really have in the world, and it is us who have been restraining them from acting aggressively to bring the war to their cowardly murderers. Israel doesnt do EVERYTHING we ask of them, but they sure try, not willing to alienate their lone American allies. It is time for Bush to effectively say "we give up, the road map is dead, we will no longer be a part of this farce", and for us to officially wash our hands of being an arbitor of middle east peace between the two sides. Our nation's support should be thrown fully behind Israel, supporting them in whatever they feel is necessary to defend themselves, only short of Genocide. 
<br />

<br />
If they wish to continue this joke called a peace process then fine, but it should not be unwillingly forced upon them when it is abundantly obvious that the Palestinian terrorists will never stop murdering helpless children.<span class="gensmall"></span>

				<td colspan="2"><div class="postbody">It just ain't as simple as you think.  Suppose that instead of Palestine, the UN had decided to move all Jewish people to New York State.  People in New York lost their businesses, homes, property.  Then, the US launched a retaliatory war, but lost (I know, it's pretty far fetched, but I want you to see this from the Palestinian standpoint).  In fact, this led to the loss of another State or two, which were occupied and settled, displacing the previous occupants.
<br />

<br />
If your family had been displaced or killed, wouldn't you be just a bit upset about all this?
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying anyone is right or wrong here.  The Israel Palestine situation is a massive screw up of epic proportions.  Jewish people have a long history of being the oppressed, and were put into an almost untenable situation.  Arabs reacted to the loss of their properties in a fairly understandable fashion.  There also appear to be forces at work that wish to continue instability in this region for some time to come.  Every attempt to bring peace to the region has been subverted.  Every time I hear about problems in the Middle East, it makes me want to open up the Book of Revelations again.<span class="gensmall"></span>

<br />
>> I'm not saying anyone is right or wrong here
<br />

<br />
I know what happened. I know that the Palestinians have been screwed out of some land. At this point, I no longer care. I do not care about their grievance, they should be considered to have forfeited their entire claim.
<br />

<br />
Terrorism is not a legitimate tool for the meek to force recognition, it does not deserve the legitimacy of war, rebellion, political solutions, or diplomacy. It is the cowardly criminal's way out, and as such, any who practice it should be hunted down and imprisoned or killed wherever they hide.
<br />

<br />
There was a very clear and obvious political process tried at least a half-dozen times with no success to give them exactly what they (claimed) they wanted, but the murdering cowards and those who are too incompetant or unwilling to stop them did not want to resolve their grievance like civilized human beings. They are barbarians who only know strength and fear, so now it is time for it to be returned unto them. Its time for Israel to do whatever it is they think they have to do to protect themselves, short only of mass-murder.
<br />

<br />
There most definitely is a right and wrong side in this conflict, and the latter lies with the unflinching unapologetic cowardly murderers. There are actually two competing terrorist groups argueing with one another right now, trying to claim credit for today's murder, as if this was a business.
<br />

<br />
There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to believe that the terror would cease if they were given their own land, their damned religion (or twisted form of it) commands and rewards the killing of jewish people. Israel would lose the sovereign ease in ability to go after Hamas, et all within their borders with a full concession now, and so before taking such a huge risk, they only wanted a sign of good faith, a brief respite of murder to show that they seriously meant what they promised, promises which have been broken again and again.<span class="gensmall"></span>

				<td colspan="2"><div class="postbody">There are 4 conflicts going on at the same time. And they get wrapped up into 1 thing and folks don't understand why they are confused. Here they are separated so that things are a little bit clearer.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">1. Israelis are fighting to protect their homeland from agression.</span>
<br />
All but the anti-Iraelis would agree that this is a legitimate battle. Building the wall falls into this area. I think that bulldozing the homes of terrorists falls here, some folks would put it into 2 below. Handing a bomber a cellphone made of plastic explosive falls into this area. Throwing terrorists into jail falls here. The Old Testament (or Torah if you are Jewish) said that this is the land promised to you by God.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">2. Israelis are fighting to eliminate Palestinians.</span>
<br />
Wars of anihilation are not good things. They are called genocide by most folks and should be resisted. Bombing apartments falls into this area. Some folks think bulldozing the homes of the families of terrorists goes here, and thus they think that blocking the bulldozers is a proper protest. The assasination policy of the Israelis falls under this issue.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">3. Palestinians are fighting to eliminate Israelis.</span>
<br />
Wars of anihilation are not good things. They are called genocide by most folks and should be resisted. Suicide bombings fall into this area. The old (is it old or is it still part of their charter?) charter of the PLO calling for the destruction of Israel falls into this area.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">4. Palestinians are fighting to establish their own homeland and protect it from agression.</span>
<br />
All but the anti-Palestinians would agree that this is a legitimate issue of the Palestinians to have their own homeland. <span style="font-style: italic">Begone, evil invaders!</span>
<br />

<br />
Further complicating the issue is Anti-Semitism. I am not really sure why folks hate Jews as much as they do. People hate Jews even when there are none around, like the AumShinrikyo cult in Japan (the folks who released nerve gas in the Tokyo Subway, built an automated factory to build machine guns in Japan, were making chemical, biological, radiological and energy weapons as well) blamed much of what was wrong and decadent on some Jewish conspiracy (the number of Jews in Japan is tiny). Anti-Semitism seems to go beyond mere tribalism into something almost surreal. I try to study it, for example, my father's family is very antisemitic and racist, but it is almost like a colorblind person trying to understand blue. I just don't get it, because to them, <span style="font-style: italic">We the people</span> does not include women, democrats, non-whites, non-christians, jews, n**rs, sand n**rs (other words that make the forum filter say I_AM_RACIST_BAN_ME) and so on as either humans or deserving of civil rights (wind them up and push the buttons and that list can go on for about an hour). It is real sad since his family fled Germany in 1940 to get away from the people that he and his brothers grew up to become.
<br />

<br />
Don't forget to add to the equations that each of the groups involved has a different set of values on things. The Israelis are more like the American set of values. The Palestinians value adult men far more than women or children (when an apartment gets blown up, they mourn the dead soldiers, not the bystanders). Both sides tend to take the approach that <span style="font-style: italic">you are 100% for us or you are 100% against us</span>. The Soviets gave military and economic assistance to the Arabs up to the end of the Soviet Onion, but that was mostly because we gave aid to the Israelis, under the principle of <span style="font-style: italic">the enemy of my enemy is my ally... for now</span>. And that set up a feedback loop, anyone the Soviets gave any sort of assistance to was instantly the enemy, and this stopped people from thinking any further about the merits of who might possibly be right or wrong.
<br />

<br />
Sharon thinks some of his tactics were part of 1 above, but are instead falling more often into issue 2. This causes the Israelis to lose the moral ground. When things get a little complicated or hard to figure out, you may want to draw 4 boxes, label them, and write in them what the issues are. You may find this to be helpful in trying to understand why some screaming idiot got crushed under a bulldozer: what issue from the above list was she fighting against? 
<br />

<br />
There are people in Israel who will not benefit from peace. Remember who shot the Rabin? It was not a Palestinian, it was an Israeli. The people who's power base comes from keeping the battle not in issue 1, but in issue 2. Or maybe to them, issue 1 and issue 2 are identical, I am not sure. Or maybe they are, in spirit, fellow travelers of my father and uncles, unable to see that Palestinians bleed the same color blood as Israelis. Which would be kinda strange cus my dad and his brothers would rather build a huge wall around the mideast and lob nukes over the wall: <span style="font-style: italic">kill them all, God knows His own.</span> or maybe <span style="font-style: italic">kill them all, they all write backwards</span>.
<br />

<br />
And yeah, I consider our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq hypocritical. But then we seem to only want quick solutions that come with snazzy slogans. Things that require thought are not fashionable. Things that require time to fix are not fashionable. Just look at the advertising on TV: you cannot cope with reality, take our little pill. Things in the media have become like Gresham's law: bad information (slogans and soundbites) drives out the good. People don't get overweight eating one hamburger too many, but they want the weight off by taking 1 pill. Unfortunately the issues in the mideast did not spring forth fully formed from the head of Zeus, they got there one hamburger at a time. Expecting a miracle cure is disingenuous at best. I predict the mideast to take decades, maybe centuries, to achieve peace. Every bad decision needs a good decision (or reasonable compromise) to counterbalance it.<span class="gensmall"></span>

				<td colspan="2"><div class="postbody">That was actually a decent post, maybe we'll be able to have a good discussion instead of falling back into the old camps and hurling sound bites at one another. I'm tired now, I'll just be a bit brief and say tonight that my feeling, my bias, is to assume that Israeli action mostly falls under 1. When Palestinian innocents die, it is (seemingly) an indirect, unfortunate, and unavoidable result of an aggressive hunt for terrorists and their leadership. On the other side, my feeling is that Israeli deaths are as a result of 3., rather than 4. It would be foolish to publicly admit to a religous mandate to eliminate jewish people from the earth and risk losing any support, but it is going to take a lot to convince me that they have any interest in actually trying to work constructively for their supposed goal of regaining land. (Rather than the more obvious goal of extermination). I think its all a facade, an excuse to try to justify murder and avoid justice. 
<br />

<br />
Militarily pretty much the entire Arab world lacks the ability to defeat Israel, it has been tried before with no success. Israel has been forced to become as strong as they possibly can, and the only avenue left to the zealots wanting to kill jews is terrorism. I honestly dont believe they are trying to use terrorism for a specific purpose, but rather they are using terrorism for its own purpose, their only effective way to work towards what their twisted religion commands. 
<br />

<br />
I do not believe that specifically targetting leaders of terrorist organizations responsible for murder is "assassination." Using that word lends these terrorists a dignity they do not deserve. This is more like shooting a rabid dog in the head so that it stops biting little kids.
<br />

<br />
I could be factually wrong, who really knows. However, when I see on one hand Palestinian bystanders dying usually from accidents during military operations which have clearly defined goals of going after terrorists and their leaders, vs Jewish deaths resulting from senseless bombings designed to kill young children, my motivation and desire to try to "feel" or "understand" the Palestinian point of view becomes almost non-existant.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Its MY opinion that Israel has tried to show a regard for human life as much as possible in dealing with Palestine. WE seem to deal with the Arabs as a whole with gloves on. MY best guess as to why is the amount of oil they have, but when the dealings start crossing the "common sence" line something should be done. Once Palestine get it Nation its already said that it will build a army to push Israel into the sea. That has been the goal and that goal has not changed.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Seriously though, the majority of the people of the Middle East are all uneducated. They all hate each other, and until they are taught otherwise they are just brainwashed hate monkeys who have guns. Slowly some of this is changing, VERY SLOWLY, but starting a World War III (by fully backing Israel) could potentially be the end of the world. THIS IS THE BEST SOLUTION. The Jews and Arabs may still hate each other, but since the takeover of Palenstein 90 years ago this is a problem that needs to be solved.

If we did back Israel, The Arab countries would unite. America may be a free country, but it is known as being Christian (even George W states he is a Christian). The Muslim religion believes there are no other right religions, and any land that is not under Muslim control is part of a "Holy War". World War III... However, slowly, many Muslims have walked away from this extremity, as 80% (or something) of Muslims are not shi'ites (I believe this is the extremist Muslim name). Iraq was the last country to be a majority of shi'ites (and it was a very close division between the classes). Even making peace slowly is better than World War III.
<br />

<br />
An anology....With the nuclear weapons capabilities available to so many countries, and so much built up hate it's just a time bomb waiting to explode. Rather than trying to cut one of the wires quickly, by joing Israel, (w/o knowing which color it is) we are taking the time to solve this problem (a peace plan between the TWO independent countries), to find the right wire, without the bomb going BOOM!

George W also wants a peaceful solution as the Middle East provides mucho oil!<span class="gensmall"></span>

Get a few facts straight.
<br />

<br />
The UN (actually, the British, who had the place after WWII) did not GIVE the jews anything.  Jews moved to a desert that no one wanted and no country claimed and BOUGHT the land, paying outrageous prices in most cases.  It was a Zionist movement to reestablish Israel, and it worked.  On the contrary, the British, and then the UN, did their best to block jewish immigration, and the formation of Israel.
<br />

<br />
THERE NEVER WAS A PALASTINE!  No such organized country has ever existed.  The term has been used to identify a geographc area, but was never a country, people, or government.  The concept of a Palastinian nation is recent, within the last decade or two, and is a blatent copying of the Zionist movement, which movement "Palastinians" deplore, lol.
<br />

<br />
While no person, nation, or cause is perfect, there is clearly a good guy and a bad guy in this conflict.

Israel can go the the bargaining table (voluntary or forced) as many times as you like but this violence will never end because Hamas and Islamic Jihad and whoever else you care to name will only be happy when every Jew in the world is dead.  Now how does israel negotiate with that?  The only way there will ever be peace there is if the Palist. govt. gets serious about cracking down on these guys.  At that point, I would imagine it's likely that the heads of the Pal. govt would probably have their carcases and/or their family's as well drug through the streets some morning.  Sadly it's unlikely that there will ever be peace in israel.  It's just a sad part of life that they're probably be killing each other long after we're dead.<span class="gensmall"></span>

No Palestinians should be permitted into Israel...none.  Sorry, both sides will lose jobs but it's clear that even women will strap bombs to themselves to kill people.
<br />

<br />
That's it.  Palestinians have no airplanes or helicopters to fly over the wall.  And if big enough like the Chinese wall, even rocket propelled explosives will only damage it.  If you clear like 20 feet and put barbed wire and lazer detectors, nobody will approach it anytime soon.
<br />

<br />
Basically yes what I'm talking about is like the Berlin wall, but with better security.
<br />

<br />
The only real way to stop the violence on both sides is to separate them for a while, even decades.  If Palestine has to build up it's own country without jobs from Israel, so be it.  If Israel can no longer bring in cheap labor from Palestine, so be it.
<br />

Otherwise you will see continue what has happened in the past, small period of peace while one or both sides reorganizes, then more violence and then more talk about peace, lather rinse repeat.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Time to set the way back machine to way back to the book of Genesis (chapters 16-25 should be good enough for ya). Abraham and Sarah were unable to have kids, so according to the customs of their time, Abraham knocked up their maid, Hagar. The child from Hagar was called Ishmael. But when Sarah hit 90, she suddenly got knocked up too (with Isaac). Oops, now Hagar and Ishmael got sent away. Jews consider that the nation of Israel were the descendants of Isaac, the son of Abraham and Sarah. Muslims consider themselves the the descendants of Ishmael, the son of Abraham and Hagar. 
<br />

<br />
History of the pissing match will also need to consider the Balfour Declaration, the Brittish trying to keep the Jews/Israelis/Zionists from establishing a significant presence in Israel, the struggle for the Israelis to establish a homeland in Palestine. Also please note that the displaced Palestinians have never been offered residency or citizenship in any of the Arab countries that they have set up refugee camps in. And all the so-called nations in the mideast were artificially set up by the British after WW1. It was the spoils of war, right or wrong, and we are still paying the price for WW1: WW2 and the cold war were merely down payments for the butcher bill of WW1. 911 and the "mideast crisis" are more fallout from the consequences of WW1. People were too proud to admit the mistakes of the war to end all wars (yes, that is what it was called at the time), our parents, our generation, our children are still paying the price. 
<br />

<br />
Who is called a freedom fighter, or called a terrorist, is very much a matter of who is doing the labeling. Ansar Al Islam is, I think, a good example of this. It is an AlQeda linked group engaging in assasinations and bombing campaigns in both Iraq and Iran. It was protected from Sadam by the no-fly zone in northern Iraq. Since it was attacking both Iraq (pre-invasion) and Iran, the US State Department refused to label it a terrorist organization. Instead, it received US military protection from both Sadam and from Iran. Remember what happened to the Iraqi military whenever they went into the no-fly zone? They were attacked and destroyed by coalition air power. Why is the US government protecting an AlQeda organization in Iraq, while destroying pretty much all of Afghanistan to get at AlQeda there? Because the Iraqi-AlQeda organization was attacking the enemies of the USA. Hypocritical. There are still people in the US who think that McVeigh's action in Oklahoma was an appropriate response to Ruby Ridge and Waco (What A CookOut!). Those people consider McVeigh to be a patriot and freedom fighter, and consider the US Government (mostly the IRS though) to be terrorists, and those folks are also gungho on killing off AlQeda and Hussein (cus they are neither christian nor white). Also hypocritical.
<br />

<br />
The 2 categories of Muslims are Shi'ite and Sunni. Sunnis are the most numerous. The easiest explanation of the basis for their differences has to do with the succession of leadership of the Muslim faith. Think of it as similar to the difference between Protestants and Catholics on the issue of "who decides what the word of God <span style="font-style: italic">is</span>" and you are pretty close.
<br />

<br />
Sharon has been successful in moving the Iraelis from Issue 1 to Issue 2. Even some in the Israeli Air Force are uncomfortable with the bombing of the residential areas enough that many are dropping their bombs in the ocean. <span style="font-style: italic">Sir, I was unable to lock onto the target</span>. Imagine that, civil disobedience in the military. Who would have thought of it? I sincerely believe that Sharon thinks that the only good palestinian is a dead one. The peace process in the mideast will just have to sit on the back burner until Sharon is out of power. Or, when all the Palestinians become <span style="font-style: italic">good ones</span>. Have you been reading or watching Pro-Issue-2 propaganda lately?
<br />

<br />
Yeah, I used to be pro-Israeli on the Israeli-Arab issue. I have lived in Arab countries. I know what <span style="font-style: italic">those sort of people</span> are like. The Israelis are more like Americans than pretty much anyone else in the world (both economically and politically). In Israel, like in America, what you do is more likely to lead to success or failure than who you know: a meritocracy. Arabs are the opposite in this. In the Arab world, the clan (tribe) you belong to is more important than your merits. This has lead to why Palestinian refugees can't just become citizens of where they are now. Why aren't they becoming Lebanese/Syrian/Egyptian/Libyan citizens even after living there for decades, or being born there? They belong to the wrong clans/tribes. This tribalism was what led to the Baathists staying in power so long. You cannot eliminate clans by proclaiming a democracy, you have to prove over and over again that a meritocracy is superior to tribalism. And we still have not done that completely in America, we still have bullshit about race here: one skin color will get you stopped by the police more than other skin colors (which is tribal nature). And I see the tribalism in the US getting worse. I contend that tribalism will destroy America, and that folks will deny it is happening. Folks who claim that America has been declining since prayer in school was outlawed just want their tribe to gain power. 
<br />

<br />
One of the things that we seem to have in the West, is the concept of just walking away from power. Based on the myth of Cincinatus. That once your successor was lawfully elected, you would just go home. That myth does not exist in Islamic countries. There, they hold onto power until it is torn from their hands (by death if necessary). I think that is also part of why Arab leaders hold on to power long past when they should let the next generation take over. I am not sure we can teach that lesson from the barrel of a gun. I think that the lesson coming from the barrel of our guns reinforces the notion that you can only hold on to power with more guns.
<br />

<br />
The issues in the mideast will not be settled in our generation, nor in our childrens'. Building a wall should delay things until a real solution can be made. I agree with Maob on this point, that wall needs to be total and absolute. No cheap labor coming to work from Palestine. I don't know what that solution might turn out to be, but the hatred and animosity run very deep. It will take time to overcome.
<br />

<br />
PS. I once dated a woman who came from Russia. Sometimes we would make jokes about the Soviet Onion, she would wig, and I would point out all the onions on the tops of buildings. Just look at them. Some fast food restaurants have burgers on the roof, why can't buildings proclaim the onionness of the soviets? Like Big Boy and his big burgers?

Would you like fries with those onions, ma'am? And don't give me crap about them being pre-soviet, I know that, it was one of the fun things we did on Sunday afternoons while pizza was cooking. I miss Svetlana.<span class="gensmall"></span>

<br />

<br />
No, it depends. Historically, Chechen resistance has focused on military targets, and attacking Russian soldiers. They had been trying to drive them off and achieve their goals militarily.
<br />

<br />
More recently, a few terrorist bombings have occured, blamed on Chechen groups. When this happens, they are clearly labeled and known as terrorists. However, since these incidents are more recent, and more isolated than conventional fighting, it is not accurate to label all of Chechen resistance as terrorists, other than those who engage in terrorism.
<br />

<br />
In contrast, Palestinian resistance seems to be almost totally uninterested in Israeli military. There are a few pot shots here and there, but there activities are almost completely dedicated to terrorism rather than any legitimate military or rebellious action.
<br />

<br />
When you open the paper and read of terrorist suicide bombings in whatever label it falls under, it is not as if before you read the details, you know it could randomly be equally likely any one of a dozen places in the world, and we only focus on those acting in Israel, forgiving mislabelling or ignoring it anywhere else, it is almost ALWAYS the gutless Palestinian cowards in Israel the vast majority of the time. You dont even have to read the first paragraph, you see suicide bombing and safely assume Israel, you become stunned when you find out it DIDNT happen there.
<br />

<br />
When you try to locate and point out isolated groups here and there which have engaged in terrorism not even remotely close to the scale we are speaking of here, it is basically trying to justify it all by saying "hell, everyone else is doing it, why not them?" This argument is inaccurate, morally bankrupt, and misleading.
<br />

<br />
You act as if the Israel military attacked Palestinians unprovoked and are receiving deserved repercussions. This argument is crap, and (I would hope) you know it. You can not compare mass-murder of jewish women and children, to going after terrorists and razing a few family homes.

<br />

<br />
I'm not isolated in my thinking here, obviously people in Israel have a lot more at stake than I do, and all indications are that unless the Palestinian leadership pulls out a miracle very soon, this pathetic facade called a peace process is about to come to an end.<span class="gensmall"></span>

As for labelling, it really is not that complicated. Terrorism vs military action, rebellion, "freedom fighters", etc is not a matter of arbitrary opinion. If your violence is confined towards military objectives, destroying your opponent's infrastructure, attacking soldiers, taking holding and controlling land, that is not terrorism. When you blow up a bus filled with children, randomly targetting helpless innocent civilians, that is terrorism, deserves no rights or protections under Geneva, and as far as I'm concerned, is grounds for being shot in the head if you are caught and found guilty of engaging or directing in terrorist activity.<span class="gensmall"></span>

<br />
What, you mean as opposed to whats going on now?
<br />

<br />
Read your history, this actually did happen, and it was irrelevant. Many times, multiple Arab countries went to war with Israel, and they all lost every single time. As a result, Israel actually gained land and expanded their territory in resolution of each conflict.
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />
Israeli War of Independence (1948-1949)
<br />

<br />
Upon independence, Israel was invaded by the armies of six Arab nations: Egypt, Syria, Transjordan (later Jordan), Lebanon, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. In addition, local Arab Palestinian forces also fought the Jewish Israelis.
<br />

<br />
The Six-Day War (1967)
<br />

<br />
In a rapid pre-emptive attack, Israel crushed the military forces of Egypt, Jordan and Syria and seized large amounts of land from each. Iraq also participated in the fighting on the Arab side.
<br />

<br />
The Yom Kippur (Ramadan) War (1973)
<br />

<br />
In a surprise attack launched on the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday (the dates also fell on the Muslim Ramadan holiday), Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. Despite aid from Iraq, the Arab forces failed to defeat Israel.
<br />

<br />
The Israeli Invasion of Lebanon (1982-1984)
<br />

<br />
In response to repeated guerrilla attacks by the PLO, which were launched from South Lebanon, Israel invaded with the intent of destroying Arafat's forces. Syria, which maintained a large army in Lebanon, fought Israel and suffered an embarrassing defeat.
<br />

<br />
The Israeli Occupation of South Lebanon (1984-2000)
<br />

<br />
As they withdrew from most of Lebanon seized in the 1982 invasion, Israel held onto a large part of Southern Lebanon with the aid of the "South Lebanon Army (SLA)," a militia set up and supported by Israel. This occupation was opposed by the PLO and other Palestinian groups as an extension of their long-running conflict with Israel. Also, other militia armies (mostly Lebanese Muslim groups), such as Hezbollah (supported by Iran and Syria), stepped up attacks on the Israeli-occupied region as well as on settlements and military targets in northern Israel. In 2000, Israel withdrew from Lebanon and the SLA disbanded.

<br />
What exactly falls short of Genocide?  Killing ones family?torture?  Is there really anyother way to get rid of a people? No it's not.  The only way to resolve this issue is to teach Isralies and Pally's that having diffrent veiws is not a sin, living together does not make them less Israeli. less Palestianian(sp), but fighting for all these years which I belive is a lost cause, becuse it seems to me that either side is going anywhere.  So what as Americans can we do?  I say we stand by them if we are their only friends (isnt that what a real friend would do anyway), but let them resolve their own issues, let them decide when enough is enough.
<br />

<br />
The leaders may have some part is all these terrorists acts, but the people are the ones who decide is that how they want to live the rest of their lives, an eye for and eye, tooth for a tooth?  I don't know, I'm just a level 55 Shaman newb who plays EQ.<span class="gensmall"></span>
