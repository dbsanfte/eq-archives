				The following is what Chopasuey posted on the IB boards shortly after he got back from San Diego earlier this week. I am posting it here with his permission.
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Chopasuey wrote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">Well good thing there were lots that attended that run their own fan sites since I now do not have to type in that damn letter that was given to us only 1 hour after the meetings with the developers was finished. We did not expect much from this letter since they had very little time to do it but were impressed nonetheless they were able to fashion something so fast. 
<br />

<br />
Big guilds were represented along with those from the fan sites who most were not members of big guilds who had characters from lvl 20s to 50s. SOE did not suck my @#%$ but basically wined and dined us while we were there. I do however think these attempts were sincere and also think they were able to explain much of the past of how things worked with EQ and how things worked with EQ customer service. They did not make excuses but tried to be honest. If something was a @#%$ they were direct and told you just that - We @#%$ up. 
<br />

<br />
Developers seemed to be from all levels of EQ. Some are in uberguilds which would have the same bitches and concerns as most of us. Some were casual players and even roleplayers. Why players of EQ would want a @#%$ game is beyond me and I would expect these developers that play want fixes also but more then that they wanted answers to what needs to be fixed. By bringing in reps of most of the big guilds they definitely got alot of feedback on that question. 
<br />

<br />
Do I feel more confident about EQ after going to this? Yes. The implementation of the boards for us will see that issues and concerns can still be brought up as we have interaction with EQ staff. 
<br />

<br />
EQ2 is not for most of us. This was made plain and simple. Smedley told us if they could change the name of EQ2 to something else they would now. It will be focused on far more 6 person encounters up to 24 person raid. This is not going to be a game for the powergamers and they do not expect us to play it. These are the reasons they want to get EQ up to par so the raiding players still have @#%$ to do. They did not want to talk about new @#%$ but rather the stuff now that does not work. They wanted to know what was broken and what we thought as players should be done to fix it. 
<br />

<br />
I don't know why people think that this was just a publicity stunt and nothing more. There would be a much greater risk to lose the big guilds in EQ if SOE did this and decided not to fix anything. Most have so much hate for SOE that they are not giving them a chance. I wish I could tell you all that they are giving me royalties or sending me checks but they are not. I do however still like this game even with the @#%$ bugs and hard encounters that it has and if they can fix what they say then they may be able to keep me here for alot longer. 
<br />

<br />
The reason for DX9 was so they can progress this game on a graphical and performance level. @#%$ of bugs came with that but once tweaked it will give them the ability to make better looking @#%$ but also revamp older zones. They have plans to change alot of @#%$ graphically but remember with around 300 zones it will not be done by the end of the week. I have seen the screenshots for OOW and also went to the zone available through nedaria. This @#%$ does not compare to the stuff I saw there. I saw new creature models that I thought were EQ2 but they infact were EQ models using the DX9 engine. They were very badass looking in both appearance and movement animations. I spoke with the animator who was working on these and he also has recreate player models. Imagine no more @#%$ opening the mouth luclin model attacks=P This is the same guy that threw together the newest skeleton models. Faster performance models that look better then the high polygon count luclin models without the cheesy %@$# look. 
<br />

<br />
We talked about so much @#%$ that I cannot remember alot of it to post here. Things that were not touched on other peoples posts on the summit that I can remember were: 
<br />

<br />
-BIC Quest. The guy that created the BIC quest I don't think is no longer there. Seems most of the devs thought of it as a total cluster @#%$ and they are trying to fix it. People asked about the 18 man portions of this and thought it sucked to do that for one person so they are going to be changing it so multiple people can get parts for each of these instead of one at a time. They also should be increasing the drop rate of these pieces on mobs like the yxtta parts. 
<br />

<br />
-Swapping PCs in raids: The ability for the raid leader to drag and drop people into different groups. Currently it @#%$ sucks to make a raid only to then boot a couple groups from the raid to regroup them and get them back into the raid. These feature would own and save alot of time. 
<br />

<br />
-Expeditions: We talked about how easy it is to dzadd and remove people however the zone ins to expeditions are a bitch to get people to the expeditions without DA. Usually need to CoH or drag corpses. We had talked about the ability to possibly summon someone to the raid after it has begun. 
<br />

<br />
-Mage CoH: Lots mentioned about how mage CoH is getting less useful and many different things were suggested. Ability to CoH without having to be grouped. Having mage leave the raid to CoH is lame. Also mentioned was the ability to CoH out of zone. 
<br />

<br />
There were lots of other things which I will slowly remember and add to this but this is just a taste on some of the issues.

				So EQ2 is headed towards a smaller group based game?

Wtf? this makes my head swiggle. The minute I hit level 35 I was getting offers to do Efreeti raids and FG raids on Karana. EQ was so successful because it was so open ended, you could do anything. if EQ2 is all closed and @#%$, it'll be stupid. Granted 72 people is retarded, all raids should be at like 48 or less, but not having uber guilds? jfc we were having mass raids on Sir Lucan when we were all 30 trying to get SF's for our paladins heh. raiding has been an intergal part of EQ in 1 form or another with GM consent or not.<br />

Back when I played on Tunare well before the Luciln server went live people raided stuff like West Freeport just for kicks.  Not to mention the Vox and Naggy raids, Eferreti raids, Phinny and then PoH/PoF when they went live.

EQ2 is designed with more control in mind.   EQ encounters (up until PoP) were designed with the concept that the designer had no idea what the player was going to throw at the encounter.   EQ2 is entirely different with instanced encounters and locked encounters, the designer can develop an encounter for an exact number of players at a certain level.   Further, alot of the things that came to life late in EQ will be there from the start in EQ2, required level on items for example.   These type things will help stop new expansions from totally voiding the value of previous content.
<br />

<br />
Hopefully, EQ2 will avoid the problems that EQ has in regards to raiding.  Raiding should be a part of the game, but players should not be forced into a very specific organizational model (i.e. raiding guilds) in order to get to the end game content.   I believe for EQ to continue to be successful, they need alot more raid content for the second and third tier guilds.    Many of the small close-knit guilds in EQ are competing for content, not against their peers, but against some 2-boxer.<br />

				I think what Segal meant about the profanity was that with the censored words, it's difficult to read, since you have to guess exactly what censored  word was used. At least, that's my feeling on it. I don't mind profanity at all. I wouldn't mind a mod posting an uncensored version of the post.

By "hard to read" I mean it's hard to read when half the words are @#&! If half the words were actual uncensored profanity, I'd be able to read it just fine <img src="images/smiles/grin.gif" alt="grin" border="0" /><br />

Raiding should be a part of the game, but players should not be forced into a very specific organizational model (i.e. raiding guilds) in order to get to the end game content. I believe for EQ to continue to be successful, they need alot more raid content for the second and third tier guilds. Many of the small close-knit guilds in EQ are competing for content, not against their peers, but against some 2-boxer.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

This is where I disagree with you Segal. To me, having an encounter set at 32 means 32 people will be REQUIRED to beat it, and be able to beat it every time with barely any semblance of skill. anything less and you won't have enough people since its 'tuned' that way. I really dug old LoS how we did everything with WAY less people than everyone else, hell no one even believed us, but we did it. If people want to zerg stuff, thats fine with me - its just open season to point and laugh at them as gimp hacks =). 
<br />

<br />
And your wrong about the raid content, I believe in order for EQ to be successful an entire revamp of the item system, quest system and all existing content/quests need to be re-done, so that there are other goals as well. i.e making all the cities semidynamic like Kael and Icewell - making Freeport a raid zone, with the end result being the invasion of neriak , etc something super fun, and making faction matter again. Raiding should be an 'afterthought' something that the majority of people hear about, but don't ever see... like in Original EQ how people 'heard rumors' of a dragon in a cave somewhere, while those who strove to higher heights/skilled more/whatever knew that Nagafen was a dragon in Solusek's Eye... etc.. that @#%$ was mad fun - getting tells in the middle of Kedge and having peopel go 'Where is KedgeKeep?' (or whatever the zone name was, I forget:().. [/quote]<br />

				Well Deris, you can blame that on message boards and spoiler sites.  Everyone knows about everything because they've read about it.  When you get to some encounter, the raid leaders already have cross server strats, or at least some idea of what might happen.  Nothing is really suprising any more when there's someone in every group saying what he or she heard happens next.
<br />

<br />
People who don't raid know about uber zones and uber mobs because of the communication that goes on now... the linked items and people going "OMG what drops that?" spurs them to look it up on Allakazam's or Magelo and find out what drops it, what zone its from, what AE the mob casts, and details about the event.
<br />

<br />
The only way I can figure to put the mystery back in the game is to randomize it.  Or have a contantly changing environment, where defeating Naggy for example makes real changes in the game.  Have you ever done the Hollowshade cycles?  I'm thinking games need to do something like that on a much grander scale.  
<br />

<br />
There should randomly pop up new areas with monsters to defeat and quests to accomplish.  Then when defeated, they go away, or are emptied.  If that happened enough, and you never knew what you'd find next, I think these games would be a lot better.<br />
