Note that Flames & Rants permits behavior that will get users banned if that behavior is carried out in any other part of the board. Flames & Rants is NOT work safe; users who are at work are advised not to browse that forum. By posting in Flames & Rants, the poster agrees to subject themselves to scrutiny and attack from the more base elements of the Luclin community. Luclin, its moderators, and its service provider take no responsibility for what happens if users choose to disregard this warning.  It is the responsibility of the user to stay out of the Flames & Rants forum. Users are absolutely guaranteed to find something in Flames & Rants that is offensive, and posters there will often be viciously attacked. You'll find no sympathy from anyone if you are attacked in Flames & Rants. Don't post there in the first place. <br /><br /><b>Any user who wishes to view Flames & Rants must have a registered account. They must also voluntarily add themselves to the Flames & Rants access list. By adding yourself, you certify that you are of legal age to view adult content in your locality, and you absolve Luclin, its moderators, and our service provider from responsibility for anything you see and anything that happens to you in that forum. It is your responsibility and yours alone. If you refuse these terms, you are forbidden to view the Flames & Rants forum.</b><br /><br />In simpler terms: If you can't take the heat, then stay out of Flames & Rants. You have no other recourse.<br /><br />If you accept these terms, click <a href="http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/groupcp.php?g=11">here</a> and click <b>Join Group</b> to be added to the allowed group.<br /><br />The rules for Flames & Rants are much simpler. There will be no:<br /><ol type="1"><li>Editing. Posts made in Flames & Rants cannot be edited. You cannot take back what you say.<br /><li>Spamming. Do not spam in Flames & Rants.</ol>Flames & Rants has very different privacy rules. The only private information that will be deleted from the Flames & Rants forum is information that can lead to identity theft, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other normally non-private information. Publically availiable information that can be found with a simple web search such as a person's name, address, phone number, ip address, or picture is afforded no protection in Flames & Rants. Any such information will remain posted, even with repeated complaints from the user asking for it to be taken down. This information is public by law, it is not owned by the user in any way, therefore we have no reason to take it down.<br /><br /><a class="postlink" href="#Top">Back to top</a></span></td>

Signatures are restricted by style sheets to a size of 160 pixels high and 760 pixels wide at most; anything outside this range will be truncated and will only be partially visible. It may be made of images and text; the style sheet does not care and it will enforce the size restrictions regardless of the signature content. Use the signature test forum when setting up your signature to find out how well your signature is working with this limitation. Signatures will also appear only one time in any given page view, to increase loading time and make the threads easier to read. Image links in signatures that link to slow hosts and drag down board performance may be removed by the moderators. Users who continually cause problems with their signatures may be denied the ability to have a signature by the moderators. Changes to signatures are universal, and affect all posts made by a user, past and present.<br /><br /><a class="postlink" href="#Top">Back to top</a></span></td>

Avatar links to large files or files on slow hosts may be removed by the moderators. Users who do not use the avatar feature properly may lose access to it, or have their avatar link set up permanently by a moderator.

These public services are used most often by troublemakers, so disallowing them is an effective way of banning jackasses. We require a real, ISP-based email address. If someone has a valid reason why they must use one of our banned providers for email, or if they wish to activate an account without an email address, then they will need to create the account, email help@eqluclin.com requesting activation, and wait for an administrator to activate the account.

The options available to a moderator include, but are not limited to the following:<br /><ol type="1"><li> Restricting an offender to a set limit of posts per day.<br /><li> Suspending an offender from posting for a set period of time.<br /><li> Disabling or arbitrarily setting signatures, avatars, and titles.<br /><li> Permanently disabling an offender's ability to post in any forum except for Flames & Rants.<br /><li> Editing, locking, or deleting offensive posts and threads.<br /><li> Exposing the identity of one who is using multiple accounts, or posting anonymously.<br /><li> Setting a post filter that runs all of an offender's posts through a translator before it is actually posted to the board.<br /><li> Banning the offender completely from the boards.<br /><li> Exposing public information about really bad offenders and roasting them in Flames & Rants.<br /><li> Exercising the abuse clause of a given offender's terms of service with his service provider.<br /></ol>It is not wise to fuss with Luclin. We're nice people, but if you piss us off, we'll bury you in a lunchbox.<br /><br />If you notice a policy violation, report it to a moderator using the personal message feature of the board.<br /><br /><a class="postlink" href="#Top">Back to top</a></span></td>
