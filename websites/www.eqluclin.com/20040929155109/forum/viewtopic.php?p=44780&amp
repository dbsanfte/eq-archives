Seitz, Commanding Officer, on Monday, December 1, 2003.  It's worth reading and sharing. 
<br />

<br />
Marines and Sailors,
<br />

<br />
As we approach the end of the year, I think it is important to share a few thoughts about what you've accomplished directly, in some cases, and indirectly in many others.  I am speaking about what the Bush Administration and each of you has contributed by wearing the uniform, because the fact that you wear the uniform contributes 100% to the capability of the nation to send a few onto the field to execute national policy.  As you read about these achievements you are a part of, I would call your attention to two things: 
<br />

<br />
1.  This is good news that hasn't been fit to print or report on TV.
<br />
2.  It is much easier to point out the errors a man makes when he makes the tough decisions, rarely is the positive as aggressively pursued.
<br />

<br />
Since President Bush declared an end to major combat on May 1. . .
<br />
. . . the first battalion of the new Iraqi Army has graduated and is on active duty.
<br />
. . . over 60,000 Iraqis now provide security to their fellow citizens.
<br />
. . . nearly all of Iraq's 400 courts are functioning.
<br />
. . . the Iraqi judiciary is fully independent.
<br />
. . . on Monday, October 6, power generation hit 4,518 megawatts-exceeding the prewar average.
<br />
. . . all 22 universities and 43 technical institutes and colleges are open, as are nearly all primary and secondary schools.
<br />
. . . by October 1, Coalition forces had rehab-ed over 1,500 schools-500 more than scheduled.
<br />
. . . teachers earn from 12 to 25 times their former salaries.
<br />
. . . all 240 hospitals and more than 1,200 clinics are open.
<br />
. . . doctors salaries are at least eight times what they were under Saddam.
<br />
. . . pharmaceutical distribution has gone from essentially nothing to 700 tons in May to a current total of 12,000 tons.
<br />
. . . the Coalition has helped administer over 22 million vaccinations to Iraq's children.
<br />
. . . a Coalition program has cleared over 14,000 kilometers of Iraq's 27,000 kilometers of weed-choked canals which now irrigate tens of thousands of farms.  This project has created jobs for more than 100,000 Iraqi men and women. 
<br />
. . . we have restored over three-quarters of prewar telephone services and over two-thirds of the potable water production. 
<br />
. . . there are 4,900 full-service telephone connections.  We expect 50,000 by year-end. 
<br />
. . . the wheels of commerce are turning.  From bicycles to satellite dishes to cars and trucks, businesses are coming to life in all major cities and towns.
<br />
. . . 95 percent of all prewar bank customers have service and first-time customers are opening accounts daily.
<br />
. . . Iraqi banks are making loans to finance businesses.
<br />
. . . the central bank is fully independent.
<br />
. . . Iraq has one of the world's most growth-oriented investment and banking laws.
<br />
. . . Iraq has a single, unified currency for the first time in 15 years.
<br />
. . . satellite TV dishes are legal.
<br />
. . . foreign journalists aren't on 10-day visas paying mandatory and extortionate fees to the Ministry of Information for "minders" and other government spies.
<br />
. . . there is no Ministry of Information.
<br />
. . . there are more than 170 newspapers.
<br />
. . . you can buy satellite dishes on what seems like every street corner.
<br />
. . . foreign journalists (and everyone else) are free to come and go.
<br />
. . . a nation that had not one single element-legislative, judicial or executive-of a representative government, now does.
<br />
. . . in Baghdad alone, residents have selected 88 advisory councils.  Baghdad's first democratic transfer of power in 35 years happened when the city council elected its new chairman.
<br />
. . . today in Iraq, chambers of commerce, business, school and professional organizations are electing their leaders all over the country.
<br />
. . . 25 ministers, selected by the most representative governing body in Iraq's history, run the day-to-day business of government.
<br />
. . . the Iraqi government regularly participates in international events.  Since July, the Iraqi government has been represented in over two dozen international meetings, including those of the UN General Assembly, the Arab League, the World Bank and IMF and, today, the Islamic Conference Summit.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today announced that it is reopening over 30 Iraqi embassies around the world.
<br />
. . . Shia religious festivals that were all but banned, aren't.
<br />
. . . for the first time in 35 years, in Karbala thousands of Shiites celebrate the pilgrimage of the 12th Imam.
<br />
. . . the Coalition has completed over 13,000 reconstruction projects, large and small, as part of a strategic plan for the reconstruction of Iraq.
<br />
. . . Uday and Qusay are dead-and no longer feeding innocent Iraqis to the zoo lions, raping the young daughters of local leaders to force cooperation, torturing Iraq's soccer players for losing games, or murdering critics.
<br />
. . . children aren't imprisoned or murdered when their parents disagree with the government. 
<br />
. . . political opponents aren't imprisoned, tortured, executed, maimed, or are forced to watch their families die for disagreeing with Saddam.
<br />
. . . millions of longsuffering Iraqis no longer live in perpetual terror.
<br />
. . . Saudis will hold municipal elections.
<br />
. . . Qatar is reforming education to give more choices to parents.
<br />
. . . Jordan is accelerating market economic reforms.
<br />
. . . the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time to an Iranian-a Muslim woman who speaks out with courage for human rights, for democracy and for peace.
<br />
. . . Saddam is gone.
<br />
. . . Iraq is free.
<br />
. . . President Bush has not faltered or failed.
<br />
. . . Yet, little or none of this information has been published by the Press corps that prides itself on bringing you all the news that's important.
<br />

<br />
Iraq under US-led control has come further in six months than Germany did in seven years or Japan did in nine years following WWII.  Military deaths from fanatic Nazi's and Japanese numbered in the thousands and continued for over three years after WWII victory was declared.
<br />

<br />
It took the US over four months to clear away the twin tower debris, let alone attempt to build something else in its place.
<br />

<br />
Now, take into account that almost every Democrat leader in the House and Senate has fought President Bush on every aspect of his handling of this country's war and the post-war reconstruction, and that they continue to claim on a daily basis on national TV that this conflict has been a failure.
<br />

<br />
Taking everything into consideration, event the unfortunate loss of our brothers and sisters in this conflict, do you think anyone else in the world could have accomplished as much as the United States and the Bush administration in so short a period of time?
<br />

<br />
These are things worth writing about.  Get the word out.  Write to someone you think may be able to influence our Congress or the press to tell the story. 
<br />

<br />
Above all, be proud that you are a part of this historical precedent. 
<br />

<br />
God bless you all.  Have a great Holiday. 
<br />

<br />
Semper Fidelis, 
<br />

I really hope you dont mean by the US and allies. 
<br />
And did you happen to notice that the one rebuilding thing not mentioned in that letter, was the oil factories that were rebuilt? Almost every Iraqi oil field is up and running at higher production than before the war. (Since you wanted your war for oil excuse)
<br />
If it was just for oil, we would have rebuilt the oil industry, ganked the @#%$ and left. To spend that much time, money, effort, to rebuild that much in the country cant exactly be written off as some kind of half %@$# cover up just to take oil.<br />

I gave up trying to convince people that it is <span style="font-style: italic">only</span> about oil.  They can believe whatever they want to, I suppose.  Frankly it doesn't matter what they believe or think, the facts speak for themselves.

I meant to say that it is "not only about oil" - I meant to emphasis 'not' and ended up typing just 'only'.
<br />

<br />
So, just to be clear I do not think oil was an issue or if it was it is a very minor issue.  I meant to imply that the factual events of what is happening in Iraq speak to the effect that it is NOT all about the oil.
<br />

<br />
So to rephrase correctly this time, I am tired of trying to convince people that it is NOT about oil.  So many folks just go on and on about this so-called oil conspiracy and I just do not see any evidence of this.<br />

<br />
For those that keep saying retarded crap like this, let me present you a question.
<br />

<br />
Why would the US invade Iraq for their oil?
<br />

<br />
Consider this.  Of all the countries in the world with a large supply of oil, Iraq is (was) one of the most military potent countries, while at the same time had one of the weakest oil infastructures.  In other words, it takes an investment of a lot more manpower, money and other things to invade Iraq and "take their oil" than it does to say, invade Quwait and take their oil.
<br />

<br />
Do ya see what I'm getting at here?  Is it, yanno, sinking in yet?  If we wanted to just go gank someone, there are MANY countries in the world more ripe for ganking that Iraq.  Since most people who believe we fought this war only to take oil also believe that all the pretexts for going to war were made up by the Bush administration, why wouldn't we just have made up some phoney pretext for invading Saudi Arabia, or Quwait, or Iran?  All of these countries have a weaker military than Iraq, while at the same time having better oil infastructure. 
<br />

<br />
Why fight a 3 week war with Iraq and attempt to control a much larger population when we could have taken over Quwait in about 15 minutes and had a much smaller problem with resistance?  
<br />

<br />
It just doesn't make any sense to have invaded Iraq simply to take their oil.<br />

You'd have to be clueless to believe we didnt kill THOUSANDS of innocent citizens with our bombing in 91' and this past campaign.
<br />

<br />
The plain and simple fact is The government had an EXCUSE to finish off IRAQ with 9/11, even though it should have been done 10+ years ago.
<br />
GW argues "the world is a safer place W/O Saddam.Well no friggin @#%$.
<br />
It would also be a safer place w/o N.Korean Nukes.So STFU and go BOMB there asses because,"THE WORLD WILL BE SAFER".But no they'll wait till they have an excuse like a oriental man attacking a US official and then tie'ing it in to the N korean Government somehow.
<br />

<br />
The administration Fuked up and LIED to the public.Now they got to pay the piper.And btw, YES i believe the world IS safer w/o Saddam in charge,but thats not the friggin point.<br />

				In 91, the US didnt invade Iraq, they pushed Iraq out of Kuwait. The only attacks from the US in Iraq were strategic hits on communications, Iraq military sites, and places of the such. Hard to kill too many innocent civilians that way.
<br />
During OIF(operation iraqi freedom) more Iraqi civilians have been killed by Iraqi insurgents/guerillas then the US, BY FAR. Has US actions caused the death of hundreds of Iraqi civilians between these 2 wars? Probably. Did the US "slaughter thousands" of innocent civilians? F**K NO

Well no @#%$ the US needs a reason to take N Koreas leader out of power. Right now he is not a threat, let him simmer on the back burner. Personally i never thought N Korea was a threat after their Nuke announcement, they just wanted some attention.

				I've been in America for over 3 months now.  Two comments:  America is an awesome place to live and the American news is very different from other country's news.
<br />

<br />
The presidential election is this year.  The democratic hopefulls are a scary lot.  I hope that GWB will be re-elected.  GWB threw out a carrot to all the Mexican illegals the other day.  It wasn't an executive order so it won't be carried in the house because it was so outrageous.
<br />

<br />
America has a "terror alert" system all the time.  They change it to suit their whims.  Terror alert extreme is the highest level.  It fluctuates to reflect the terrorist threat that is ever present (apparantely).  America has thrwarted off thousands of threats by their amazing savvy.  Even though millions of illegal immigrants come across the border from Mexico every year America has no issues keeping out terrorists. 
<br />

<br />
Here's a true story for you that makes me upset.  I know a guy, and have met him twice now, who came across from IRAN on a faked visa card 10 days ago.  He faked it himself.  Am I to assume that no terrorist has the capability to come across either?  The American press would have the American people that there are thousands of terrorists trying to get in each year but that they catch every single one of them.   That's a gross exageration on the part of the CIA.  The press talked about undercover FBI agents walking downtown New York with golfbags and suitcases fitted with bomb detectors in them for the holidays.  I suppose a car fitted with a detector was just too inconspicous.  A man waving a golf bag around in downtown New York would seem perfectly normal.  Yet, we're meant to believe that the terror threat is ever present.  If there is a terrorist threat we'd certainly have heard something in the last 2 years.
<br />

<br />
Well those of you not from America.  In this country they feed you terrorism for breakfast, lunch and supper every single day.  Orwell could not have made this stuff up in his most fanciful stories.  Did other people know that they said the passenger ship Queen Elizabeth II was the target of terrorists?  As if they were going to run it into something.
<br />

<br />
The Americans are barking at shadows and it looks as if that will persist for a long time to come.
<br />

<br />
I don't really challenge Deris's facts because they seem fine to me.  There are a lot of good hearted people in this country who really do want to help.  Teachers and doctors making 25 times more than they used to means what?  They went from making 1 cent an hour to 25 cents an hour?  If the government cannot afford those wages when they have to pay for it for themselves will those wages remain high?
<br />

<br />
All the hospitals are working.  Great news!  Why were hospitals not working?  Did someone bomb them?  There was almost no resistance but apparantely the resistance that existed was hold up in hospitals, water-treatment facilities, food storage areas, hotels, farmers' fields, schools, on bridges, and in power stations.   Those are the most reasonable places to hide and shoot at flying planes or tanks on the ground.  Fixing something you destroyed and then bragging about it, way to go!
<br />

<br />
GWB asked for 80 billion dollars this year.  80 billion dollars would go a very long way in Iraq.  Too bad that money will never see Iraq.  When it comes time for Iraq to make reparations to America though I bet America will have no problems taking 80 billion dollars worth of oil for every year spent in Iraq.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I can see why Americans have no idea what's really going on in Iraq.  The news here is so biased as to be funny.  If any other country has soldiers dying in Iraq we never hear about it, if Iraqi people are dying we don't hear about it, if anything negative is going on over there we don't hear about it.  Censorship by omission is alive and well here in the land of the free.
<br />

<br />
Still, it's a great place to live so if America has to break a few eggs then they should just get on with it and stop trying to sell it to everyone.<br />

Do you realize how many debts adding to billions of dollars teh US has just dropped for countries? The day they went into Iraq, they basically told France, Russia, and Germany to forget about the money Iraq owed them. They have worked heavily with other countries to get debts forgiven. They arent jsut going to take 80 billion worth of oil saying "Iraq owes us".

What you failed to mention, or notice, is that the news is almost always biased against the war or military actions that dont go perfectly planned. So the US actually hears about damn near EVERYTHING bad that happens in Iraq. Watch more then the 5 minute local news and you will realize that.

Do you realize that hospitals and schools are illegal places to engage an attack from? Do you realize that not one single Iraqi soldier, insurgent, or guerilla follows the Geneva convention and rules of war for legal targets, places of engagement, etc? If they use a hospital to stage an attack, that hospital just became a legal target, same with the school, farmhouse, and bridge. The US isnt bragging about rebuilding something we destroyed. People are pointing out the fact that the US has rebuilt those school, hospitals, etc to better working condition then BEFORE the war. Nothing in that country worked for @#%$ before, most things work alot better now.

				Ok Mr. Everyone that opposes my side is clueless Jaimez, please show me the figures on deaths that can be DIRECTLY placed on the US hands. Insurgents/guerillas killing civilians because the US in the country doesnt count as US deaths. I would love to see all these unbiased numbers.
<br />
You are damn right i support the war, and i am not afraid to say so. Since this is a debate forum, i added my side of the debate. Innocent blood would not be the attackers in civilian clothes ambushing convoys or blowing suicide bombs in the middle of towns and outside military bases.
<br />
Yes there are actual stated rules to war. Sadly the US is one of the only very few countries that follow those rules. When you can find one rule of war that the US broke, please share with everyone.
<br />
Funny how people on each side of a debate are biased towards their opinion. So your words can be directed back at you. But as i told Drainer, thank you for telling me what i know. I know the US has done things wrong, i know the country has faults, i see them almost everyday. But putting a missile in a hospital that is being used to attack US soldiers isnt one of those wrong things. Civilian deaths happen in war, it cannot be avoided. The US does the best they can to keep this death toll to a minimum. When a missile or bomb is put in the wrong place and inncoent people die, those that need to be, are held accountable. There is plenty of proof on that.
<br />
When you can show me proof on all these innocent Iraqi deaths that the US is just writing off let me know. Better yet, when you can show me proof of International rules of war that the US is has broken, you will prove your point further.<br />

				It is an impressive list of improvements, but it is also clearly a ra-ra speech designed for troop morale. As drainer pointed out, a lot of the "fixes" were only required because those places were bombed by us in the first place. Not all by any means, but a lot.
<br />

<br />
I look over the list, and I think to myself "Wow, just think if we'd spent that money and effort in our own country, how much better things might be".
<br />

<br />
It is good for the Iraqis that Saddam is gone. Despite the near-constant guerilla attacks, the majority of the populace there is in a much better place today than they were at this time last year...but to be honest, I don't give a @#%$ about them. Fix what is wrong at home first. GWB may be the first American president who has trouble finding America on a globe, for all the attention he has paid to domestic matters.<br />
