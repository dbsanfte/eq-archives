<font class="print-normal">This was posted on the boards by Molleni Rainkeeper. It's a pretty good read. <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/feqluclinfrm1.showMessage?topicID=1259.topic">Click here</a> to read the original post on the boards and to discuss... or read onward to read the story here:<br>
<br>
I awoke in the morning just before dawn. I crept up to the top of the hill and watched as the sun crest over the horizon. I smiled as I felt the warmth of the sun on my face. I caressed and bathed in it's golden rays and felt at once in harmony with the nature around me. I sat down and opened my tome of spells and began to read over a distant incantation, one for changing forms. My mind immediately refreshed, began chanting the words to my lips, which spoke them aloud, a soft whisper at first, &quot;Molleni, Molleni, Molleni,&quot; then growing to a roar as my hands changed to paws and my nose to a snout. My golden form shimmered in the sun.<br>
<br>
(Click article title for rest of story)<br /><br />
But then, the prick of my ears as I caught wind of a terrible smell. The smell of blood. But not human blood, not giant blood. Bird blood. And I knew that something was happening at Aviak City. I banished my form, changed back into the halfling I was and through open the spellbook. Turning to the page with the Spell: Gate of Karana I screamed aloud the words as I felt the wind rush me from behind. I barely grabbed my book and backpack before I was whisked into the air and dropped promptly by the Druid Circle in the Karanan Plains.<br>
<br>
Ah, the Plains. A wonderful place. But something was amiss south of the river. I tracked the Nexus Scion down so that I found my bearings and headed off to the Southern Plains. The stench of blood became more and more penchant as I arrived near the Aviak City and I could see bird feathers strewn about. I had reasssumed my wolf form to enchance my speed, and I was immediately set upon by another bird.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop,&quot; I cried. &quot;I only seek to aid you.&quot;<br>
&quot;Krawwwwww&quot; it howled in my face.<br>
I knew not how I was going to communicate with these birds. I had not been schooled in the Aviak Language. I closed my eyes and quietly prayed, &quot;Dear Karana, please aid me in helping these birds. I do not seek them harm, but I cannot tell them. Find some way m'lord, find some way.&quot;<br>
<br>
The bird stopped attacking me and addressed himself as Talon Skyruner. He turned away promptly screaming &quot;The roost will be defended&quot; and ran off in the direction of more birds, and a Dark Elf Warrior.<br>
<br>
I knew immediately Karana had sent me to aid these birds. I sprinted over to the fight and began calling upon Karana's healing rains. The birds squawked their approval as their wounds mended and my healing powers enchanced their skills. I called the flora and fauna to surround my feathered friends and thorns sprouted from their skin. Finally I called upon Karana's burning rage and casted burning embers toward my foe. She fell quickly before our onslaught, and none dared approach us again. We lost no birds. We were victorious over the Dark Elf. The Roost was Defended and safe for now.<br>

<br>
Thanks to all who participated in tonights GM event. both Tankgrill (the DE in this story) and myself won an award for particpating. I won Golden Efferti Boots (sp?) but I'm not sure what she won. Event started at about 9 PM est and lasted almost an hour. Didn't get a zonelist or I would have posted it. Sorry. It was a blast though, and I hope this is the beginning of many more to come on Luclin. Thanks again.<br>
