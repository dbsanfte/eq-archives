				Saw some very interesting business analysis of this recently. It makes total sense out of this apparently bizarre move.
<br />

<br />
First, the facts.
<br />

<br />
1. PC is a commodity market now. There isn't much money to be made unless you're a top dog. IBM has Dell, Apple, HP, and Sun to compete with in this area. While they are holding their own, it's a hassle, not the kind of market IBM typically goes with. Dell still owns 70% of that market and is kicking everyone else's %@$#. IBM's core computer business is still mainframes, not desktops and servers. IBM is a service company, and a thinktank. They aren't Dell and they never will be. IBM is not so arrogant as to think otherwise.
<br />

<br />
2. IBM owns the ARM-family of processor technologies, purchased from Motorola. IBM created the Power5 architecture from this line, leading to the G5 processor. It was the first successful 64bit processor, and also the first dual core processor. It has very lower power requirements as well. IBM was first in these three key areas that are essential processor technologies for the future. AMD was the second and most successful, providing the best brand of product in all three areas. Intel is still dragging %@$#, having yet to demonstrate a real dual-core CPU and facing potentially chip-killing heat and electrical problems in their current lineup. This proves IBM to be no slouch at processor design, arguably better (and faster in development) in some areas than the current market leader.
<br />

<br />
3. IBM owns a number of hyper-technology processor fabrication facilities, unequalled by any other facilities in the world, including Intel's best and even AMD's new 10 billion dollar chip fab plant in Germany (which IBM helped design). They have been leasing time on these fabs to AMD and others for some time now. IBM's fabs have never been geared for mass production, simply quality, though it's clear they can produce in bulk if necessary. They have done many production runs for AMD to help keep up with demand while AMD was toiling against Intel. AMD and IBM have a rather friendly business relationship.
<br />

<br />
4. Nintendo and Microsoft have signed up for Power5 processors for their next generation of consoles. IBM has a market and a reason to continue developing Power5 chips, not the least of which is for inclusion in their own mainframe supercomputers in the future. The ARM architecture also lends itself well to smaller, embedded devices, a fast-growing niche that will grow until it eclipses the PC market as every device made becomes intelligent and network-enabled. Japan leads technology in this area with no one else even close to them.
<br />

<br />
5. Linux runs great on PPC/ARM architectures, and has for years. Apple runs on the G-series branch. Windows does not run on any of them. IBM loves Linux, having done more to enhance it and promote it than any other Linux company, even Red Hat. IBM has also gone to great lengths in the recent SCO trial to mercilessly and ruthlessly obliterate any shreds of doubt as to the integrity and veracity of Linux, including using the GPL to its fullest in court to test its veracity. While it is true IBM maintains a sense of honor as a company (one of the few to do so) and reacts very badly to anyone questioning their integrity, their reaction to SCO was surprisingly vehement, even for IBM. Clearly they are defending something they stake their future on, and that appears to be Linux and the legality of the GPL. This means IBM has plans for Linux. Big plans.
<br />

<br />
This sets IBM up to be a mainstream processor manufacturer, just like Intel and AMD have become. Sun is exiting that market, choosing to use AMD's processors and cease development of their Sparc processor line. IBM would undoubtedly love to continue making processors as they always have, but this time make their own, and market them accordingly. If they can't sell PCs to everyone, they'll happily sell a part of that PC to everyone. It's Intel's old approach.
<br />

<br />
Problem: you can't sell CPUs to HP, Sun, Dell, etc if you are competing with them in the desktop and server markets. They won't be giving you any of your money. The only solution to this is to exit the already hassle-filled desktop and server market. That means selling your PC division. They have done so, selling to, surprisingly, a Chinese company called Lenovo.
<br />

<br />
Now, why sell it to China? This is where things get really @#%$ interesting. China is a communist state, rapidly beginning the inevitable transition from agriculture to industry and eventually technology (and eventually educating themselves out of communism, but that's another thread). The market potential of the Chinese market is staggering, enough so that every multinational corporation has been fawning over them for decades. The PC market in China is fresh and nearly wholly untapped. They don't have many computers, but they are going to need them, literally millions of them.
<br />

<br />
The trouble with China is that they are deeply distrustful (as they damn well should be) of multinational corporations. China does not wish to become enslaved with the laws and intellectual property of other nations as Austrailia and the United Kingdom are in danger of becoming. China has a strong sense of national pride, and they wish to do these things for themselves. They have already created a proprietary TCP/IP implementation, called IPv9, and have been happily re-engineering every modern technology they adopt with a Chinese-only twist... usually maintaining only the barest levels of compatibility with foreign technologies.
<br />

<br />
As a consequence, China has openly stated they have no wish whatsoever to run Microsoft products. They are intent on developing a version of Linux (called Red Flag) and making it the "people's operating system", in other words, the government tells you to use it, and it gets put everywhere, and you are not permitted to use alternatives.
<br />

<br />
But copying/pirating Windows is easy, and legal in China. How to keep the Microsoft products out of your country, and promote your own, home grown operating system?
<br />

<br />
I think you can see where this is going...
<br />

<br />
Lenovo, China's premiere computer manufacturer, graciously buys IBM's entire computer service. In return, IBM gets a little cash, and under the table they are handed a captured monopoly market with zero competition by government mandate. IBM will be selling Lenovo Power-architecture processors, and Lenovo will be building China's PCs. Lenovo will be to China what Dell is to America, but with a much larger market share. And, these computers will be hardware-incompatible with Microsoft Windows. Intentionally. That's billions of dollars of revenue for IBM, signed, sealed, and delivered.
<br />

<br />
Microsoft would undoubtedly in that event wish to release a compatible version of Windows. If they don't, IBM maintains a lock on China, which is fine by IBM. If Microsoft does, however, port Windows to ARM/PPC, now IBM can sell their processors just as easily as AMD and Intel can sell theirs in Windows-dominated markets like USA, UK, and Australia. IBM wins either way.
<br />

<br />
Apple gets @#%$ in that scenario. Apple computers have been based on PPC architecture for some time now. This means it would be rather trivial to tweak MacOS X (a large portion of which is open Source) to run on commodity, non-Apple authorized PCs built using IBM's PPC architecture, effectively forcing MacOS out of the box and disenfranchising Apple right out of their own niche hardware market, the only thing that has kept them alive fighting Microsoft all these years. Apple's reaction to this should prove interesting.
<br />

<br />
Eventually, the Chinese will want to make their own processors; they've already stated as much. That will come much later however, because it will take an information society (not an industrial one) to match IBM/AMD/Intel for engineering. IBM's got a lock on China's first generation of computers as a processor market, and quite possibly the second or third generation as well. They don't need to sell a single Power chip here to become a world processor leader, because the deal is already done in China. Anything they can sell here (to Nintendo, Apple, and Microsoft, for now) is just icing.
<br />

<br />
Linux also captures a nation of its own for development. Most advances to linux that are created in China (where linux is looking at a 95%+ market share if this happens) are going to trickle across the Internet and into all other versions. This kind of development boost has the potential to make Linux the most capable operating system ever developed, and it will still remain under the GPL, and free to all. That spells the end of the operating system wars, driving all non-linux operating systems into tiny niches not unlike what Apple has now. This happens regardless of events in the USA, as India and Japan have also commited themselves to an "asian linux" in the form of China's Red Flag distribution. The developers in the USA (the only place Microsoft has true dominance) are simply outnumbered. You're looking at a billion new linux users by the time China enters the information age, whenever that happens. Japan went from zero to some of the best of tech wizardry on the planet in a mere 40 years. China has the same potential, just bigger problems to tackle.
<br />

<br />
This has the rather amusing effect of letting IBM affect Microsoft's destruction, or at least transformation. Some would say that has been one of IBM's driving goals for two decades, because they created Microsoft by accident with a bad business decision, and Microsoft has caused them more trouble than any other company ever has. Those people wouldn't be entirely baseless with that take on the matter, either. There is one determining factor in the PC wars... the day Microsoft releases any of their products for Linux (such as Office), they have lost the war, and are now just another player. That's the free software movement's clear sign of victory.
<br />

<br />
It's the kind of match made in heaven for IBM. Big money, big recognition, big mindshare, and a monkeystomp on Intel, Apple, and Microsoft. They also get to take credit for setting software free once and for all as a nice side bonus (they don't really care, it's alla bout the benjamins, but good PR is good PR).
<br />

<br />
It's all speculation, of course, but the writing is on the wall and it has been there for some time now. Time will tell. It'll certainly keep things interesting.<br />

I suspect it has something to do with the fact that if you invent something, and allow IBM to patent it and own it, they give you a substantial royalty on any use of your patent. It's led them to have the largest patent portfolio of any existing company, at least as far as I know.<br />

				They still have phenomenal influence on the PC market. The only reason we have an open hardware market (without licenses on every technology it uses like PCI, AGP, DDR, etc) is because IBM went with open architecture as a way to fight Apple, and the open thing worked so well it stuck like glue (even biting IBM in the %@$# later when they tried to swing it all back to their own proprietary format with microchannel). 
<br />

<br />
IBM did more than anyone but Xerox, Microsoft, Intel, and Apple to shape the past PC market. If their Linux plans work out, they'll have done more to shape its future than even Microsoft has. They'll have historical credit for both open hardware and open software, being its major backer. Ironic when once upon a time not more than two decades ago IBM was one of the most closed, proprietary companies out there. They've come a long way.
<br />

<br />
That said, the only hardware they make that I'll miss will be the laptops. Good laptops are hard to find, and IBM had some of the best and lightest models going, with great support. The only major vendor left that makes a laptop even remotely resembling a quality product is Dell.<br />
