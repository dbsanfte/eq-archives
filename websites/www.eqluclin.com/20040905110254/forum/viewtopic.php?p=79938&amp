				Chalabi was the guy who fooled W into believing that there were wmd on every street corner in Iraq.

French was the second most commonly spoken language in Iran when I lived there, English was a distant fourth (arabic was #3). Almost all of the dissidents who had to flee persecution under the shah had to run off to France. If they sought assylum in the US, they were sent back to be imprisoned and/or shot. The shah was our crony, so we were unwilling to accept that anyone could possibly be persecuted by <span style="font-style: italic">our guy</span>.<br />

I think what you really mean is:
<br />

<br />
Since the Shah was our ally in a VERY hot fracture zone between NATO and the Soviets, we had to keep friendly relations with him.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
To do otherwwise would have given the soviets control of the entire middle east and its oil.  They were already in Afghanistan and sponsoring any and all rebels including and especially Kohemeni.
<br />

<br />
Right after the fall of the Shah, Kohemenis people turned Iran into a killing field and took up the exact same tactics to control the population that had turned people against the Shah.  They ruthlessly killed off his remaining supporters AND people that had helped them oust him all in the name of god.
<br />

<br />
Worse the torture and abuse was spread to even more commoners as new islamic laws were passed to further repress the populace.  Islamic clerics who were not sunni or sunni and not sworn alliegence to Kohemeni were rounded up and shot.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
To say the Shah was "our Crony" is laughable.  No one in that area was a crony to the US.  We had to play our hand close to our chest there and make allies of leaders whom we would rather not have had to.
<br />

<br />
If anything we were the Shah's crony.<br />

The Reformation was the period when a lot of changes in europe happened, one of which was the conflict between christianity and capitalism. Capitalism won that time. The iranian revolution is an example of religeon vs capitalism and capitalism losing. The shah tried to drag iran into the 20th century kicking and screaming, and they ended up rejecting it.

To prevent the plot from succeeding Mossadegh knew he would have to continue consolidating his power. Since Iran's monarch was the only person who constitutionally outranked him, he perceived Iran's 33-year-old king to be his biggest threat. In August of 1952 Mossadegh attempted to convince the Shah to leave the country. The Shah refused, and fired the Prime Minister, in accordance with the foreign intelligence plan. Mossadegh responded by ordering troops to seize the Imperial palace and drive out the king. Eager to avoid conflict, the Shah once again quickly folded, and accompanied by his wife, quickly fled Iran.

Just from reading the rest of the Wikipedia article, it's obvious the situtation was not as clear cut as that.  The UK and US were trying to bring about their own coup at the same time.

I'm no fan of Mossadegh, but the Shah was no angel, either, as evidenced by his dissolution of Iran's multi-party political system in favor of a one party dictatorship.

The fact is: The lawful government of Iran WAS the Shah.  The Prime Minister held office at the Shah's whim.  The Prime Minister told the legal government to leave and the legal government fired him.  In retaliation he sent troops to attack the royal palace.
<br />

<br />
The US was deep in Iran suppoorting the legal government.  The Soviets were deep in Iran supporting Mossadegh's Coup.  Mossadegh's Coup only lasted a week before pro-Shah forces backed with intel from the US were able to secure his safe return.
<br />

<br />
I snicker at descriptions of the events that talk about "a complicated US and British plot" to overthrow Mossadegh.  It was not complicated at all and the plotting was primarily on Mossdegh's side.  The stealing of British assets in Iran; arranging of anti-Shah demonstrations, riots and sabotage; the dissolution of the Iranian Parliment; the usurping of military control; the exile of the legal government;  Attacking the royal palace with troops; And his alliance with Soviets to exclusively sell oil pumped with stolen British and American equipment and development.<br />

In 1951, when Parliament voted for Oil Nationalization, the young shah, recognizing the nationalists' popularity, appointed Dr. Mosaddeq prime minister.

He amassed power. When the shah refused his demand for control of the armed forces in 1952, Dr. Mosaddeq resigned, only to be reinstated in the face of popular riots.

He then displayed a streak of authoritarianism, bypassing Parliament by conducting a national referendum to win approval for its dissolution. Meanwhile, the United States became alarmed at the strength of Iran's Communist Party, which supported Dr. Mosaddeq. 
<br />

<br />
In August 1953, a dismissal attempt by the shah sent Dr. Mosaddeq's followers into the streets. The shah fled, amid fears in the new Eisenhower administration that Iran might move too close to Moscow. 
<br />

Yet Dr. Mosaddeq did not promote the interests of the Communists, though he drew on their support. Paradoxically, the party turned from him in the end because it viewed him as insufficiently committed and too close to the United States.

These opponents criticized the Shah for violation of the constitution, which placed limits on royal power and provided for a representative government, and for subservience to the United States. The Shah saw himself as heir to the kings of ancient Iran, and in 1971 he held an extravagant celebration of 2,500 years of Persian monarchy. In 1976 he replaced the Islamic calendar with an "imperial" calendar, which began with the foundation of the Persian empire more than 25 centuries earlier. These actions were viewed as anti-Islamic and resulted in religious opposition. 
<br />

<br />
The shah's regime suppressed and marginalized its opponents with the help of Iran's security and intelligence organization, the Savak. Relying on oil revenues, which sharply increased in late 1973, the Shah pursued his goal of developing Iran as a mighty regional power dedicated to social reform and economic development. Yet he continually sidestepped democratic arrangements and refused to allow meaningful civic and political liberties, remaining unresponsive to public opinion. 
<br />

<br />
By the mid-1970s the Shah reigned amidst widespread discontent caused by the continuing repressiveness of his regime, socioeconomic changes that benefited some classes at the expense of others, and the increasing gap between the ruling elite and the disaffected populace. Islamic leaders, particularly the exiled cleric Ayatolah Khomeini, were able to focus this discontent with a populist ideology tied to Islamic principles and calls for the overthrow of the shah. The Shah's government collapsed following widespread uprisings in 1978 and 1979. Pahlavi Dynasty was succeeded by an Islamic government under Ayatollah Khomeini. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

==================================
<br />

<br />
Before the reformation, it was illegal for one christian to charge interest on loaning money to another (which Shakespeare rendered as <span style="font-style: italic">neither a borrower, nor a lender be</span> in Hamlet). Therefore, the only semi-legal finance industry was jewish (because they were not christian). The word usury originally meant charging any interest at all.  Deut 23:19-20, Jeremiah 15:10-14 among others were used as the biblical basis for the ban under the catholic church.
<br />

<br />
The markets for money, stocks and insurance came about at that time. The loss of control of the catholic church allowed those industries to thrive. And these markets perish when a nation turns its back on capitalism and turns instead to sharia.

One of the main issues with sharia, and why islamic nations cannot succeed in the world has to do with their insistance that charging interest at all is illegal. Which is why the wealth of islamic nations flees to capitalist countries. Dividend/interest rates on islamic funds tend to be in the low single digits (over the long term). Even a passbook savings account in the US earns higher interest than a sharia compliant fund.

				Sharia law is repeating the same control mechanisms the Catholic church did centuries ago with tithing.  The church once having been the primary power (even above the emperors in most cases) needed a way to gauge the wealth of "its nation."  What better way than to force people to give you 10% of their income?  After all the Lutheran reforms went into place and the pro- and counter-movements of that era were thorough that stupidity was removed from the collective minds of Christians, capitalism was able to move forward.
<br />

<br />
Muslims are still stuck in time just before the Renaissance, so a large portion of Muslims are willing to swallow the invasive control of Sharia.  With Sharia and investments there's usually a group of people at each fund/company/exchange who will closely monitor all bank accounts of Islamic members.  They get to view everything about your wealth and can even balance your account just the way the mullahs... I mean Allah wants.
<br />

<br />
You can't do %$#@! squat without asking your imam and that's how the religious authorities want it.  <a href="http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=12404" target="_blank" class="postlink">You can't even watch animate objects on television!</a> Once people can think for themselves and learn you don't need Sharia or a mufti to tell you what the Qur'an says or means, then Muslims will finally enter the modern world.<br />

				Ask the Imam is always full of laughs:

<br />
QUESTION:
<br />

<br />
Is it permissible in Islam to have friendship(not close) with the non-muslims through chatting on the internet?
<br />

<br />
I had some non-muslim friends with me. I chatted with them regularly but a Muslim friend of mine told me it is not permitted in Islam so I stopped chatting with them but i m still confused. So tell me whether its a sin to have a chat with non-muslims or it is permissible in Islam.
<br />

<br />

<br />
ANSWER:
<br />

<br />
One is allowed to mix with non-muslims and chat with them on permissible topics, however they should not be made close friends. This of course is for those of your on gender. Chatting with the opposite gender is prohibited. 
<br />

<br />
Your intention when dealing and chatting with them, should be to invite them towards Islam. 
<br />

<br />
and Allah Ta'ala Knows Best

<br />
Yes, you can talk with non Muslims as long as they don't reveal to you truths about the real world or counter the authority of our omniscient muftis!  Also, convert them to Islam.  Our image has taken a big hit lately and we need more numbers.  Thank you, come again.<br />
