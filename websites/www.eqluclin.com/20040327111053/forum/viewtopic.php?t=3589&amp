				The question of hospitals in Iraq being bombed and shot at because there were military installations inside is interesting.  My question to our global community is:
<br />

<br />
Was the WTC a military target?
<br />

<br />
Do spy agencies and military offices with a complex make it a valid target of war?
<br />

<br />
While I expect and hope for a lot of opinon, Im posting here rather than F&R with the hopes that some will provide answers that include legal precedent, convention, and treaty as well.<br />

				Well since the buildings were owned by the port authority, the complex as a whole cannot be considered a target for that.
<br />
The majority of the buildings were offices for private sector buisnesses, so no target there.
<br />
The only fire arms that I am aware of belonged to building security and the secret service. Security isn't a military threat unless they kept a tank behind those desks, so no real target there. And secret service is department of treasury, so they are also independant of military as well, thus no target.
<br />
The buildings have a large enough civilian use that it really wouldn't be considered a target for military, and it wouldn't be for ours at least unless the only presence was a military force. But we have weapons that can take out 1 floor instead of the entire building, so if there was a military threat it could be dealt with without taking down the towers. 
<br />
So it is if a target is provided, but normally it was not, so no, I say it was not a military target.<br />

				Scalezs pretty much summed it up. The only thing i really have to add atm would be that it would have become a military target if we were physically(not intel etc) combating  enemies from it. If someone was invading the US, and soldiers hid in the towers as cover, then the towers are legal. If there was a missile launch site in the towers, then it is a legal target. I will see what else i can dig up to state specific rules of war that would answer this question.<br />

One specific quote that sticks out, although it only mentions religious buildings in the quote, does pertain to any non-combatant civilan building.

Usually, only combatants and military objectives may be targeted. We also try to ensure that the weapon we use would not create unnecessary collateral damage. Collateral damage includes civilian casualties and damage or destruction to cultural, religious or historic buildings or objects............Under LOAC, any normally protected entity, such as a mosque or cultural site can lose its protection if the enemy uses it in a way that makes it a military target," he said. "It would be a tough assessment, but if the commander determined it was of sufficient military necessity ... it could be targeted." </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
And a little snippet on use of precision guided missiles versus "dummy" bombs.
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">There is nothing in LOAC, (rules of engagement), international or domestic law that says we have to use PGMs. If we wanted, we could drop 500 bombs to take out a bridge as we did in (World War II)," he said. "It's just within our psyche that we want to minimize collateral damage." 
<br />
While PGMs give American commanders the ability strike targets with near-surgical precision, those tactics can also be a double-edged sword from which some leaders view JAGs as their primary defense. 
<br />
"As we've become more precise in our targeting, the world has begun to demand that we be even more precise," he said. "There's nothing in the Geneva Conventions that requires us to use PGMs, but because we have the ability, we take it upon ourselves in that way." </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
So as so many like to say we aqre barbaric and dont care. The US spends millions of dollars on PGMs to lower collateral damage even though we dont have to.
<br />
And yes, i act like i know alot about this because i do. The Air Force(and pretty sure each other branch) require at least annual training on LOAC(Law of armed conflict) and rules of war.
<br />
If anyone can find one reason that the towers was a legal military target, please let me know. But keep in mind that Al Qaida and Taliban are not actual military forces, they are what is considered lawful non-combatants.<br />

				The attack was to strike at or destroy that which Osama, Al Qaeda and others despise, Western Dominance mainly through the Free Market system.  Ironically this is how Osama made his money of course, hypocrisy runs deep in this 'ideology.'
<br />

<br />
In the world and the mind of the west, WTC as NOT a valid military target.   In the mind of the above mention individuals and people like them WTC was a fair target.  This 'war' they are waging isn't some send your soldiers on the field, line up in ranks and fire at the other soldiers.  Its kill and destroy everything that respresents what you hate.  Its not all that unique, as all religious fundamentalists terrorists have similiar doctrines that conceptualize their struggle as some universial titanic battle of good vs evil.
<br />

<br />
Lastly I'll add this; In war, anything and anyone is a target.  The idea that there is a proper course to engage in this activity like its a game of risk is almost nonsensical.  From the first war man has waged against man the only rule that matter was killing the guy in front of you before he killed you.
<br />

<br />
*As a side note I do not advocate people or countries that wage war while committing atrocities, however 'rules' in warfare is still a degree mind boggling.<br />

				It does not matter if Osama et al think that perhaps the WTC are a military target, the definition of such targets is outlines by the Geneva convention.  The question, though, is:  where the WTC <span style="font-style: italic">military</span> targets.  Simple answer is no.  Sure they may have been some sort of social, economic, pyschological targets but they were/are not military targets as defined by the international community.

Also, might I add, the civilian aircraft were not military targets either.

Sure, in individual combat the only goal is to kill the person before they killed you, but you also gotta remember since mankind first waged war there has always been rules and protocol.

In fact, in most cases, it was not the goal of an army just to slaughter everybody, but rather to conquer and absorb the people (e.g. ancient Romans, Napoleon, etc).<br />

By somehow giving war rules and defining how everyone should act it sugar coats the reality like some type of full contact sport.  Evaluate any perspective(Bushido, Chivalry, Geneva etc) on how soldiers should act in battle and you'll find it essentially attempts to civilize and dumb down the nature of war.<br />

Symbols are important when you are engaging in theater. Destruction for the sake of destruction is very rarely done by anyone. You want to: 
<br />
1- destroy symbols important to both your enemy and your audience, and
<br />
2- not destroy symbols in a way that would create sympathy for your enemy. 
<br />
If you want to get a fast understanding of what sort of terrorist did an action, look at what "power" the symbol represented, and where was the power of the symbol pointing at: it is an extension of the phrase "who benefits." Symbols that project power internally onto the US would be attacked by domestic terrorists: they simply would be invisible mentally to external terrorists. Symbols that project US power onto the world would be invisible to domestic terrorists, but important to external terrorists. Send anthrax to US politicians? could be either, but if the politicians attacked were all democrats (and no republicans), that is a distinction visible only to domestic terrorists.

Q: Was the WTC a military target? 
<br />
A: No. Not in the western concept of "military target." 
<br />
Q: Do spy agencies and military offices within a complex make it a valid target of war?
<br />
A: Yes. If the military targets are destroyed along with the "hospital" the world audience won't like it (where is the proof? uh, inside the crater). But installing a military facility inside a medical one would be a violation of the 4th convention. Destroying one that is there is not a violation of the 4th convention. <a href="http://www.genevaconventions.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Texts of the geneva conventions</a>.

				Trysbrina's post is 100% on the mark. It is not a question of is it a valid target, it is an idealogical/philisophic war we are in as far as Al-Qaeda is concerned. Unless people understand that and take action based on that, we will make little progress. As far as the Iraq war goes, that is small potatoes compared to what would have to be done to get rid of the threat. The countries in the middle east that are more dangerous than Iraq was are Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Syria-in that order (my opinion). I guess the Iraq invasion was the most feasable, and we are hoping for some kind of snowball effect in the middle east from that. I sure hope it happens.<br />

Should we be putting military installations in civilian business sectors?

Should we put day-care centers inside buildings that have Soldiers (Military or other special combat policing like ATF or SWAT) housed there and logistics centers within?

Don't get me wrong on this at all. I am not questioning the validity of Osama and his boys actions.  Valid or not it happened and it was an attack on my people.

				Trys I totally disagree with you. Rules are needed in war because the object of the war is to defeat the ENEMY. If we are at war with Germany, every single German isn't our enemy... the military who is fighting us is our enemy. As we all know as Americans, just because our COUNTRY is doing something, does not mean that all Americans are for what America does. Rules are to protect the "innocents" as it were; and to punish those who will use those innocents to further thier means.

				Zerg, the goal of defeating the enemy (defined as the fighting force of said nation) only came into play relatively recently in warfare.  Before that most wars ended with the defeated population either TOTALLY wiped from exisistance or subjugated.
<br />

<br />
The Britons pretty much wiped the Celts clean from the Earth.
<br />
The ancient Persians effectively destroyed too many civilizations to name and when they marched on the Pelopponians they were not there to simply defeat the Greek fighting force.
<br />

<br />
I undertstand why we have rules and on every level I do not disagree with them.  I merely state that from an outside and objective view on the nature of the rules (and I suppose with some elements of philosphical though) they make little sense in the big picture.  However, I know why those rules are there, you said it yourself;

Rules attempt to, but they really don't.  Whether a civilian was accidently blown up or intentionally, he's still blown to pieces and isn't coming back.
<br />
In nearly every culture and religion killing tends to be the absolute worst act one human being can commit against another.  Which is why every religion and culture creates a justification system not only for the soldiers but for the non combative populace as well in hopes that they can understand and support what soldiers are ordered to do.
<br />
So for the act for which many on Earth consider the ultimate wrong, man has developed rules so we can say it was 'less' wrong or even proper.  Yeah it makes no sense, but then again the nature and typically the reasons why warfare has occured for thousands of years makes no sense.<br />

				Well Poppa, maybe this explanation can help a little bit. As someone pointed out near the top, the towers were civilian buildings, and the secret service inside are a Government org but not a military org.
<br />
So, as i was getting to, lets flip the situation a wee bit. Lets say the US is attacking Afghanistan in an act of war. The US would look at the towers and see secret service inside with 25,000 civilians. Since that SS office does not create a big enough threat to justify killing a potential 25,000 people, the US would not use an air attack to take it out. If need be, they would hit it with a ground attaack or special forces.(And of course the US wouldnt hijack airliners to run intot he buildings)

This is the risk vs reward that i had mentioned earlier. The US does this with every target. The intel that the US can pull in would simply amaze everyone here, if we all knew how much they actually knew and could find out. The US has the most high tech intel equipment, thus giving us the best ability to weigh risk/reward before an air strike on something.
<br />
Does taking out a surface to air missile site out in the middle of nowhere with an air strike have a positive risk vs reward? Most likely yes. No civilians around, and it takes out an aircraft killing machine. Does taking out a hotel  in the middle of Baghdad that snipers use for cover with an air strike have a positive risk vs reward? No, this is where special forces, regular ground forces, etc. would come in. Maybe a tank to the window the sniper is using wouldbe good.
<br />
Anyone that would attempt to hit the US the way the Taliban/Al Qaeda did, is not thinking about these things when they pick out their targets. Their thoughts would seem to be on making the biggest mental/emotional/physical/visual hit they can, civilians or not.<br />

I would have to totally disagree with that.
<br />

<br />
The ancient Chinese did not wipe out every civilization, neither did the Mongols, nor the Huns.  The Greeks and the Egyptions not to mention the Romans got along great.  Alexander the Great apparantly did his best to not destroy his enemy, but rather assimilate their ideals.  Huge trade routes existed thru Mesoptamia (sp?) and into India and China.
<br />
The Vikings invaded northern France and stuck around and become part of that culture.  Then later they invaded England a la Battle of Hastings and sure the monarchy was conquered but the people were not slaughtered.
<br />

<br />
Sure, I bet there were some civilizations that were totally wiped from existence, but I would wager that would have been a very rare thing indeed.
<br />

<br />
To contrast you had a particular person in the 1930s and 40s that wanted to slaughter many cultural groups.<br />

				Genocide and Salting the Earth are as old as mankind.

<br />
Both are mentioned in the old testament.
<br />

<br />
Trying to get the practices thought of as "out of bounds" is a fairly recent development.  It used to take a lot of effort to erase a culture.  Certainly not cost effective.
<br />

<br />
Since the advent of weapons of mass destruction the cost has fallen well below the mark vs benefit.  Hitler had a transortation and communications infrastructure to round up and imprison cultural miscreants.  Chinas cultural revolution and Stalin's purges also would have been impossible without these things.  France would not have been able to mass murder nearly as many aristocrats had they not had a guillotine.
<br />

<br />
Chemical weapons like mustard gas and tanks and land mines inspired the geneva convention.  Genocide in Armenia by the turks impossible without helicopters, flame throwers and machine guns.  Hussein neded sarin to use on the kurds.  The Pakistanis and Indians...

				Xianin, you aren't reading history books. Rome went to war with Carthage, and at the conclusion, destroyed their city (where the line "no 2 stones were left touching each other" came from), marched the survivors off to slavery and plowed salt into their fields so that no crops could ever grow there again.
<br />

<br />
When the Mongols approached a city, they demanded the surrender of the city. Cities that did not surrender were destroyed: women enslaved, all males too tall to walk under a table (like over 4 years old) were killed, anything that could not be carried away on horseback would be burnt. The mongols would raise armies from the cities that did surrender and use those as front line troops. This way, no mongols would be hurt if it came to a battle. Why was it safe for virgins and bags of gold to travel across the mongol empire? Because the lands were emptied of people. I think Christianity would have had a hard time surviving if the Mongols did not stop their westward expansion.
<br />

<br />
Several of the crusades involved the total anihilation of the folks defending a city or fortress. The line "kill them all, God knows His own" came from one of them.
<br />

<br />
Aztecs and Polynesians slaughtered the losers. One rationale for the steep stairs on the central american pyramids was that it "tenderized the meat" after the pow/slave was sacrificed to the gods (and kicked down the stairs). Tenochtitlan had several (14, I think) huge stacks of skulls which the conquistadors calculated had over 100,000 skulls per stack. 
<br />

<br />
During the Hundred Years war, many cities were totally depopulated (the survivors ran away and returned months or years later). The economy and crops of many areas were so devastated, that cannibalism resulted among some of the survivors.
<br />

<br />
The Rwanda/Burundi war in the last decade was rather gruesome. Around 20% of each country was killed. Most of the dead were civilians chopped up with machetes, machine gunned or burned to death in churches.

The advent of modern (US Civil war and later) weapons made it easy to mow down vast numbers of people. Pol Pot only needed machine guns to kill off 2/3 of the population of his country. Stalin only needed prison camps, trains and handguns to kill off the tens of millions that died in the great terror. 
<br />

<br />
Our concept of what is reasonable, legal, or lawful in the way of combat grew out of that sort of history. Folks saw what happened in the US civil war, and the Franco-Prussian wars and started what is called the Geneva Conventions. The first of the geneva conventions was signed in 1864, covering the treatment of wounded. Later conventions elaborated on the treatment of prisoners, civilians and attempted to mark out what weapons are not kosher. Mechanized warfare makes it a little too easy to kill millions. You don't need fancy shmancy stuff like nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Any country with the technology to make beer or bread can make biological weapons. Any country with the technology to make bug spray can make chemical weapons. But that does not stop folks from lusting after them.<br />

Good question Pops.  Hospitals are legitimate targets, when not used as such, according to the Law of Armed conflict.
<br />

<br />
However, civilian spy agencies, etc, are not military, and therefore not valid military targets.  Even with a military recruiting office in the building, you could only target and limit the damage to that area, but...try to tell that to heathens that eat goats and dynamite dogs!<br />
