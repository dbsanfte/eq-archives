Thanks Gobb! Mrs. Poppa made Ribs this time.  They were first cooked with onions and apples and a dry rub of brown sugar, cayenne, and salt.  She then made a BBQ sauce with apple butter, apple juice, bourbon, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, and, of course, more cayenne.  It was very yummy &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/images/smiles/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;smile&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every country in the world owns land in common for the people.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not true.  There are americans with complete title to their land and have recorded title history going back to spanish land grants for authority.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As far as I know, every country has rules that regulate what you can and cannot do on your property. Most countries also have rules by which your property can be taken from you (with supposed fair market compensation) in order to facilitate public projets like roads, sewers, power lines and other utilities. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This varies widely in the US and unfortunately may get really nasty in places with a new supreme court decision.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While in a very simple world it would be very nice to have complete domain over one's property, the world is more complicated than that. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I do not believe that.  There is a social contract that I recognise and maximate (I do live in the reeal albeit slightly injust world) But I thinkwe could socially evolve to live quite well in a world such as that.  I think it would be signifcantly more peaceful.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
has spent a good part of the money made from oil revenues bettering the education and health care for the people of Venezuela. One of the proven methods to improve your economy is through education. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The father of a friend of mine told me tales of life for a child in Castro's Cuba.  The children were visited weekly by party members.  On one such occasion, he would relate that the children were told to put their heads on the table and put their hands out.  They were then told to wish very hard and pray to Jesus Christ and ask for candy.  Of course none would come and they were then told to repeat the process but to ask out loud with hands down, to ask for  Fidel to give them candy.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The austerity measures that the IMF and World Bank forced on Venezuela made many of them even poorer
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An institution that lends, owns.  Do not borrow, if you cannot repay.  I don't think we should be lending like this either nor cooperate in its use. (We should set an example.) Charity should be given without strings, nor force. To do otherwise, enslaves a populace while corrupt @#%$ suckers drink the nation dry and live in mega millionaire paradise whithin Europe somewhere when done.  Wanna bring up the thrid world? Join up with or give money to the peace corp.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Most of the oil pumped out of Alaska is shipped off to Asia.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oil is a commodity.  What ever is the cheapest direction of delivery will be used.  The price is owrld wide stable meaning a barrel in Britain is about the same in the US on the market.  Taxes and delivery fees not withstanding.  If the oil is bought for delivery in Shanghai, then it will come from the easiest provider, Alaska.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This is why very lilttle middle east oil gets to the US for consumption.  Europe is the biggest delivery spot for middle east oil.  Pacific oil goes to China and Japan etc as well.  These routes of delivery and free market are vital to the world.  There is a social contract between countries  that says you do not corner the market and force shortages.  That contract has been broken of late with oil.  That's not good for staving off war if other issues of security arise.  Failure to sell to the opn market bring heavy reprecussions.  Like a blockade, it is a move to kill someone or someones, and it is an act of war.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Corporate profits are always more important than national security, every single time. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I dont think governemnt whould be in a position to play &quot;more important&quot;.  When oil was developed in Venezeula, there was no one laying claim to the oil or the land.  It was raw wilderness.  No one had right to claim it but those that developed it.  Governments that interfere in development are doing evil to men.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;If voting could change the system, it would be illegal.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="postbody"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It would appear California doesn't give residents carte blanche when it comes to self defense, but neither is the law as dire as Poppa proclaims.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I have no doubt prosecutors in certain jurisdictions will give folks a hard time for defending themselves, but the law clearly makes provisions for self-defense.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
In LA County, unless you are connected, you will be charged with 1st degree murder.  Placed into the scariest of holding cells, subjected to what is referred to as deisel therapy (moved from one jail to another with no sleep for days) until you relent and cop a plea.  If you are in a &quot;gang area&quot; (which has very broad understanding) you will have charges hanging over you that are virtual hammers.  LA County municipal courts have 99% conviction rates.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Self Defense is a big no no, because of the way the law is enforced.  They will whack you hard here if you protect yoruself.  There are areas here where people take an active role in the self defense.  These are dangerous places and the police are simply not involved.  Part of that is that people cannot protect themselves and involve the police and trust that they will be treated with justice.  Therefore criminal reprisal and vigilantism run rampant.  For this protection, people form gangs.  I feel that there is a connection to people loss of empowerment and the rise of gang violence.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Each state and each municipality within often have different laws about self defense is handled.  Arizona has a very lenient interpretation and enforcement of self defense that includes the defense of property and fence.  San Francisco however will grind you into the ground for killing a burglar on top of your bead with a knife at your throat demanding sex in front of your dead family.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
In the United states, it is generally the republicans that defend self defense, democrats suppress it with vehm.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;If voting could change the system, it would be illegal.

One of my best friends brother was Border Control.  He left the service unable to live with how they had to treat people.

Not true at all.  There was a number of Iraqis that wanted us in there and Sadam out.

Freedom: If they want it we will enable it.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Routing Terrorists: In part.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Imperialist expansion:  Not even on the plate.

As an aside, coalition forces in Afghanistan have such a tenuous hold on the country that opium production has inrcreased 20 fold. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
20 fold? Compared to when?  What method would you want us to use to control opium production?  Shall we try the brutal methods of the Taliban?
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Wide spread capitalist enterprises is a good sign.  Bummer at the choice of crops.  But I can think of things that are of far more importance in Afganistan than controling narcotics trade.  What a terrible distraction when infrastructure needs building.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;If voting could change the system, it would be illegal.

Yeah, I know.  Poor choice of words on my part, especially since I personally favor...um...lower standards for self defense.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/images/smiles/lmao.gif&quot; alt=&quot;lol&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Have you ever noticed how terribly insecure some straight people are about their sexuality? Queers say, &quot;We don't recruit anyone. We can't. Sexuality is innate and not subject to peer pressure.&quot; Straight people say, &quot;Be like us! You have to be like us!&quot; And not only that, they assume that the Queer lifestyle is so wonderful that everyone will go running to practice it at the slightest encouragement, even though it brings a morass of guilt-tripping and discrimination. Gee, that doesn't say much for plain ol' vanilla missionary sex, does it?&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
-- Sheela Adrian, writer on gender studies, erotica, and alternative sexuality, responding directly to the above quotation in a personal letter to Cliff Walker, October 18, 2000&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Like I said, the law doesn't give you carte blanche.  If you use force, you better be able to justify it.  Not an unreasonable principle in general, but California seems to have a higher standard than many other states.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Texas law, at the other end of the spectrum, gives you much more leeway.  Quoting from the same website:
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;It is not necessary that there should be actual danger, as a person has the right to defend his life and person from apparent danger as fully and to the same extent as he would have were the danger real, as it reasonably appeared to him from his standpoint at the time.&quot;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
As restrictive as California law is in regards to self defense, it doesn't seem as bad as Great Britain's notorious lack of a right to self defense.  But I would not be surprised to find California's powers-that-be wish to emulate the British model.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I'm a white yankee living in Michigan.

&lt;br /&gt;
I still say its ok to arm civilians and send them as &quot;Militia&quot; to the boarder, with authorization to shoot illegal aliens.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
On a related note, I just bought Worms: Fort Siege or something like that for the X BOX. One of the weapons launches mexicans at your enemies to explode in a fiery mass of chili.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
so cool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Again, it's ok if the government violates a persons right of self protection, but its not ok when the people demand that the government recognizes those laws?
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Sounds like self protection from the government is in order...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The coup was overturned within 72 hours. &lt;a href=&quot;http://arizona.indymedia.org/print.php?id=6232&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;Unlike Mossadeh in 1951 Iran, Chavez kept the generals on his side&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Half of Venezuela's middle class ended up in the poor class after the bottom fell out of the oil prices in the middle of the 80s. The austerity measures that the IMF and World Bank forced on Venezuela made many of them even poorer, the riots over new laws that the IMF/WB forced on Caracas killed over 200 people. I recommend you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1576753018/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;, as I plan to post a book review of it this week.

The oil we will pump out of ANWR will also be shipped out and sold to foreigners, since it will be leaving the same oil terminal as the Prudoe Bay oil leaves from. Bet you didn't expect &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; from the Energy Bill.

&lt;br /&gt;
Take him out to the ball game?
&lt;br /&gt;
Take him out on a date?
&lt;br /&gt;
Take him out like Aristide?
&lt;br /&gt;
Take him out like Noriega?
&lt;br /&gt;
Take him out like Allende?
&lt;br /&gt;
Pat's counterfeit apology is the sort you hear children say &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;&quot;oh, I am so sorry I got caught&quot;&lt;/span&gt; Pat has a law degree, he should know better than to advocate murder. Even if he did get away with it before.

It's cheaper than a war.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; I forget, maybe I should ask Pat for the answer. I doubt that I could find it on my own in the bible. &lt;/a&gt;

No, they failed to maintain control over their own government and madman, thus making it necessary for us to deal with the situation.
&lt;br /&gt;

It does'nt matter, regardless how it's presented it &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;WILL&lt;/span&gt; be twisted opposite of was attempted...
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
And there is the point, regardless of the good or bad intentions someone will make it out to be &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;EVIL&lt;/span&gt;...

Here's the thing.  If the US gets involved in forcing what they think should be in the Iraqi constitution, it will not be respected.  It will be viewed as imperialist crusaders forcing their will upon the upstanding muslims (by Iraqis and the Islamic states in the region).
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;

And I think the Iraqi people should pay for their freedom in OIL... &lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Great, but they didn't ask for your help.  This is akin to seeing someone in the ocean a fair ways from shore, asking them if they want you to pull them aboard your boat, they tell you no they are fine, but you haul them in anyway and then present them with a bill for your services.  You can still demand it, cause you have their wallet, but it's not necessarily correct legally or morally.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;poppa wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Iraq belongs to the americans ATM. We would LIKE them to take ownership, but we certainly get to set goals. The law allows us to be quite totalitarian if it were out desire to be. It is not. If you are going to judge this occupation, then you better compare it to other historic occupations then ask yourself, just how moral are these americans.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Are you there to provide freedom to the Iraqis, route out terrorists or to carry out imperialist expansion?
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
As an aside, coalition forces in Afghanistan have such a tenuous hold on the country that opium production has inrcreased 20 fold.  Apparently much of the revenue from opium production is going to fund terrorist organisations.  Not sure how this relates to the current discussion, but it's certainly not a positive thing for the world in general.  By the way, I fully supported the invasion of Afghanistan.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;Dread Lord Gobb

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="postbody"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
(I'll insert some charts later if needed right now I have got a party to host.) &lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Poppa throws the best parties!
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Every country in the world owns land in common for the people.  You can purchase this land, make arrangements to use this land, and even travel freely on it.  We don't live in a world where he who has the most capltal can run in, fence it all off and say it's his because of the dint of his labour (at least not in the last hundred years or so).
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Shazar makes some excellent points - companies can't just run in and extract oil.  There are rules to follow.  Many companies lease land or pay royalties to land owners in order to extract resources under them.  I know a few farmers who make a nice bit of coin from royalties from oil and gas wells on their property.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
As far as I know, every country has rules that regulate what you can and cannot do on your property.  Most countries also have rules by which your property can be taken from you (with supposed fair market compensation) in order to facilitate public projets like roads, sewers, power lines and other utilities.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
While in a very simple world it would be very nice to have complete domain over one's property, the world is more complicated than that.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding Chavez:
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Pros: 
&lt;br /&gt;
- has spent a good part of the money made from oil revenues bettering the education and health care for the people of Venezuela.  One of the proven methods to improve your economy is through education.
&lt;br /&gt;
- land reform, while seeming to remove property rights from some also rights some historic wrongs that have occurred in the country.  People, especially natives, were removed from their land without consent or compensation.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Here's how land reforms work according to wkipedia:
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;wikipedia wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Ley de Tierras (&quot;Law of the Lands&quot;), passed by decree in November 2001, created Plan Zamora to enact land reforms in Venezuelan agriculture: taxing unused landholdings, expropriating unused private lands (with compensation), and giving inheritable, unsellable land grants to small farmers and farm collectives. Venezuela has seen a vast disinvestment in its rural areas since oil wealth was discovered; the country has an urbanization rate of more than 85% and it is a net food importer. The rationale given for this program was that it would provide incentives for the repopulation of the countryside and provide &quot;food security&quot; for the country by lessening dependence on foreign imports. There are three types of land that may be granted under the program: government land, land which is claimed by private owners, but whose claims the government disputes, and disused private land. To date, only the first two types of land have been distributed.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Note that to date only government land and disputed land has been distributed.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Cons:
&lt;br /&gt;
- zealously anti-american
&lt;br /&gt;
- may be a Castro style socialist (read dictator without a real democratic system of electing representatives).
&lt;br /&gt;
- may be building a hitler youth style group of brainwashed youngsters to support him (it may be something completely different, but I'm skeptical at this time).
&lt;br /&gt;
- has some strange ideas

Strangest propoganda device I've ever seen.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I had a few other references up the other day when I was reading up on Chavez, and he's got many other odd ideas.  I also think he'll abuse his power to limit the ability of any opposition to be democratically elected.  This isn't uncommon in South America - or even the Americas in general.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;Dread Lord Gobb

How about we load the helicopters with nice fist sized rocks, have them stay above 30' in the air and give the crew free reign to drop rocks on any crowd that tried to throw rocks at them.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;Dread Lord Gobb

It looks like the California law you are quoting requires that you fear for your life or safety.  In Canada you can detain someone shoplifting in your store - tho I think you have to catch them as they leave.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;Dread Lord Gobb

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="postbody"&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Not in California. You are neither allowed to protect yourself or your property in this state. &lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Really?  A quick google on California self defense law reveals:
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;table width=&quot;90%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt; 	  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;genmed&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;	&lt;tr&gt;	  &lt;td class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Use of a Firearm or Other Deadly Force in Defense of Life and Body
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;The killing of one person by another may be justifiable when necessary to resist the attempt to commit a forcible and life-threatening crime&lt;/span&gt;, provided that a reasonable person in the same or similar situation would believe that (a) the person killed intended to commit a forcible and life-threatening crime; (b) there was imminent danger of such crime being accomplished; and (c) the person acted under the belief that such force was necessary to save himself or herself or another from death or a forcible and life-threatening crime. Murder, mayhem, rape, and robbery are examples of forcible and life-threatening crimes.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Self-Defense Against Assault
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;It is lawful for a person being assaulted to defend himself or herself from attack if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing, and does in fact believe, that he or she will suffer bodily injury&lt;/span&gt;. In doing so, he or she may use such force, up to deadly force, as a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances would believe necessary to prevent great bodily injury or death. An assault with fists does not justify use of a deadly weapon in self-defense unless the person being assaulted believes, and a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances would also believe, that the assault is likely to inflict great bodily injury.
&lt;br /&gt;
It is lawful for a person who has grounds for believing, and does in fact believe, that great bodily injury is about to be inflicted upon another to protect the victim from attack. In so doing, the person may use such force as reasonably necessary to prevent the injury. Deadly force is only considered reasonable to prevent great bodily injury or death.
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: The use of excessive force to counter an assault may result in civil or criminal penalties.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Protecting Ones Home
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A person may defend his or her home against anyone who attempts to enter in a violent manner intending violence to any person in the home. The amount of force that may be used in resisting such entry is limited to that which would appear necessary to a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances to resist the violent entry. One is not bound to retreat, even though a retreat might safely be made. One may resist force with force, increasing it in proportion to the intruders persistence and violence, if the circumstances apparent to the occupant would cause a reasonable person in the same or similar situation to fear for his or her safety.&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.self-defender.net/law4.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;http://www.self-defender.net/law4.htm&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
It would appear California doesn't give residents carte blanche when it comes to self defense, but neither is the law as dire as Poppa proclaims.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I have no doubt prosecutors in certain jurisdictions will give folks a hard time for defending themselves, but the law clearly makes provisions for self-defense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
