Fairly easy when they are throwing molotov @#%$ and chanting "Yankee go home". There had been a recent (at the time, not recent to today) incident where some US servicemen had been involved in an accident of some sort, and it had resulted in a few Koreans dying in a fire. Perhaps their blood was simply up over that (like the US soldier in Japan accused of raping a japanese woman several years back), but the faces in that crowd were more than just hormone infused college students looking to duck final exams by protesting. You have personal experience that I do not.

And thankfully, this is one area where we aren't drawing down nearly so much. The USS Ronald Reagan was launched not too long ago, and there are more coming down the pipe. It is unfortunate that they are so damned expensive, because they do work very well.

Desperate times call for desperate measures. In the face of the strong likelihood of losing a conventional ground war, who knows what the indians might do? As for the chinese responding by turning india into a parking lot...2 major problems I see with that:
<br />
1) No point in invading a country that glows in the dark. You can't exactly live there, and all the effort in taking the place is wasted if the land isn't good for anything.
<br />
2) China would be effectively irradiating itself with massive quantities of fallout. The mountains would provide SOME cover, but the results in China would be nothing short of catastrophic.
<br />

<br />
Course, that is all extremely hypothetical...it isn't as if China isn't already suffering from an overpopulation problem. Since India is too, why go invade someone to alleviate a problem, when they are having the same problem you are? Those two countries between them have 1/3rd of the world's population.

Since there is no medicine that has ever existed that can treat a virus (only prevent the spread), I fail to see the individual relevance here. Is there a SARS vaccine? If so, it managed to slip heavily under the news radar. So, can't cure it, can't vaccinate against it...the key then becomes to educate about it so people can avoid the risk factors. Again, most of the SARS outbreak was in Beijing...a condensed population center, which theoretically is no different than Toronto. Yet the results turned out much different.

It's the policies and rules they live under that dictate the kind of success that Hong Kong enjoys, not its predominant racial makeup. Taiwan has been ruling themselves (and under circumstances far less ideal than Hong Kong), and they seem to be doing pretty well. You make it sound like I'm trying to say that the chinese people are incapable of success. That's simply not so. It's their government that holds them back.

<br />
Okay, thats cool but the problem with Vietnam is that we never played to win in the first place.  If our Air Force had not had such limited targeting, we would have thrashed the North.  Instead we were handcuffed to bombing only military targets.  Now, don't misunderstand and think I would approve of bombing civilians, but a lot of civilian infastructure servers a duel purpose.  A factory that makes cars can be re-tooled to make tanks or planes fairly quickly.  If we had had free reign to bomb the industrial areas and utility grids of Hanoi back into the stone age, we would have run over the north pretty quickly.
<br />

<br />
As far as riots in South Korea, I'll admit that they take place.  However it's a tiny minority of the population.  Keep in mind as well that the NK's make a passtime of slipping "sleeper" agents over the border to instigate stuff like this.  There is a certain percentage of the population that does not want us there, and they are VERY vocal.  They are, thankfully, outnumbered by the quiet majority about 100 to 1.

<br />
You're making a false comparison here.  Little Boy, for it's lack of size, was a very complex piece of machinery.  It was also an air-dropped bomb.  The fusing mechanisms for a bomb that you could just carry around in a large suitcase and remotely detonate (or even suicide-detonate) are quite a bit more complex.  You have to have a directional explosion capable of causing nuclear fusion to take place, you can't throw togather a few wads of uranium and set a match to it.  
<br />

<br />
So yes, you could put Little Boy in a big box, but unless you knew how to fuse it, it's just an inert mass.  You could jump up and down on it, you could shoot it, you could blow it up with a pipe bomb...and it wouldn't detonate (although if you blew it up with a pipe bomb it would probably irradiate a small area (few city blocks), although I'm not sure it would be at a lethal level).  Making a nuclear device is only moderatly difficult.  Wiring and fusing it to where it will create a nuclear explosion is quite difficult.

<br />
Let me try to explain this (and Deris can probably back me up a little here).  If you have never been to an Asian country, you are arguing from a disadvantage.  They are, in many ways, totally alien to westerners.  For example, in Korea there is no concept of "standing in line."  We westerns stand in line for just about everything.  Concert tickets, DMV, amusment parks, hell we stand in lines to take a @#%$ at a baseball game.  In Korea, there is no such thing as a line (well, rarely).  They just push and shove until someone gets served or helped, and then the pushing and shoving starts again.  What I am trying to say is that we often have a very hard time understanding the way asains think.  Even those of use like myself who have spent a considerable amount of time over there are often left scratching our heads.  
<br />

<br />
The Chinese culture is very deeply rooted in honor.  Sometimes on the surface it doesn't show, and it's not as intense as it was in say, the days of the Samuri, but it's still there.  They would happily slag India even if it ment turning the country into a wasteland to avoid losing face.  If India lobbed a nuke at China, the Chinese would probably consider it disgraceful not to respond.  Unfortunatly for India that reponse would be harsh and final.
<br />

Not all wars are about ownership of land or resources.

Yes and no.  Southern China would experience some fallout, but India's populations centers are not numerous.  It wouldn't take very many nukes to kill a LOT of Indians.  Additionally, tactical nuclear weapons have come a long way.  China has not advanced as far as we have (I hope) in this realm, but they're pretty far along.  They could vaporize an armored division without doing excessive damage to nearby areas.

Consider who SARS kills though.  The very young, and the very old.  Now sometimes thats not the case, but honestly those people are at risk of dying from just about anything.  I don't think it's so much a dig at the Chinese ability to control a disease as it is the fact that old people infected with respratory disease tend to die no matter how good your doctors are.  
<br />

<br />
Just like the media sensationalism of the huge flu epidemic that was supposed to happen here this year.  It's been three months...I didn't even get a flu shot and lo and behold, I LIVE!  Guess it wasn't quite as big a deal as the media wanted it to be.  The point is that the very young and elderly die, and they do it a lot more than other people.  The outbreak in China was worse that it was in Canada, and Canada has many favorable factors going for it, namely geography.  To me, saying that China has poor infastructure because a few 100 people died of SARS makes no sense.

<br />
Well, part of the problem was that the Chinese Gov't tried to cover it up, so the population didn't know about it until there were a lot of people already infected.  The communicability of SARS is pretty low anyway (or bodies would be stacking up world-wide).  Here's some more factors:
<br />

<br />
1) By the time SARS got to Canada, we already knew about it, and were able to screen for warning signs and issue travel alerts.
<br />

<br />
2) Thus, the number of carriers in Canada vs China was very small.
<br />

<br />
3) Thus, the outbreak in Canada was much smaller.
<br />

<br />
4) SARS is not fatal in the vast majority of people who contract it, so it's hard to know how many people actually got the Virus on both sides of the pond.

Okay, but regardless, if a 6.5 richter earthquake happens to epicenter near ANY major city, a lot of things are going to fall down and go boom.  There are many cities in the US that are not earthquaked proofed because there are no records of Earthquakes in that area.

Having a large population does not equal power, in fact I would argue that China's population is holding them back.  Same with India.  Having a large land area also has very little to do with power.  Much of China is inhospitable mountains.  Much of Russia is frozen tundra.  
<br />

<br />
Here are the things I think that should be used to gague infastructure:
<br />

<br />
1.  Communications.  The ability to communicate in real, or near-real time, over all the population centers of the country.  China has this.
<br />

<br />
2.  A strong industrial base with enough strategic resources (both material and personnel) to run them.  China has this.
<br />

<br />
3.  A strong (not neccissarily large), well trained military, with a technological edge over your peers, and the ability to produce and maintain your own armored vehicles, planes and missiles.  China has this, and gets bonus points because not only do they make their own equipment, they're a major exporter.  
<br />

<br />
4.  An independant civilian air industry (or, more to the point, the ability of your population to get on a plane and fly somewhere else in the country).  China has this.
<br />

<br />
5.  A network of roads adaqute to allow travel in both rural and urban areas.  China has this (but I'll grant that it could be better).
<br />

<br />
6.  Electricity.  The major and lesser populcation centers have enough electricity to provide for their needs.  China has this.
<br />

<br />
7.  Water/sewage.  The ability to provide fresh water for your population centers and to remove sewage and waste from them.  China has this.
<br />

<br />
8.  Trade goods.  Having a large number of items that other countries will buy OR having the majority share of a niche item (could be a natural resource like oil, or a luxary resource like wine or precious gems) in the region.  China has this.
<br />

<br />
9.  Economy.  This is the most complicated but I would say something like this.  Having an economy in which the population has enough faith that they are not activly seeking to leave the country (or rioting).  China usually has this.  Unemployment not at a dramatic level.
<br />

<br />
10.  Stable Govornment.  A strong, central govornment that has been working for a long time.  No major rebellions, no coups, no unexpected changes of leadership.  No rapid change in system of govornment.  China has this.
<br />

<br />
Those are in no particular order, by the way.  Now, I won't argue that China does not have an infastructure equal to the US, they don't, but they would rank pretty darn high in a world wide taste test.  Just as an example I'd stack em up like this.
<br />

<br />
Grade of A+:  United States, Canada, England (UK), France, Germany (several other European nations)
<br />

<br />
Grade of A:  Japan, Australia (more European nations).
<br />

<br />
Grade of A-:  China, South Korea, Isreal, Kuwait
<br />

<br />
Grade of B+:  Russia, South Africa (borderline B), Jordan
<br />

<br />
Grade of B:  Saudi Arabia
<br />

<br />
Grade of B-:  Pakistan, maybe India
<br />

<br />
Grade of C:  Most of Eastern Europe, Lybia
<br />

<br />
Grade of D:  Pre-war Iraq, Serbia, Kosovo
<br />

<br />
Grade of F:  North Korea
<br />

<br />
Obviouslly just examples, but China ranks pretty well in my opinion.
<br />

Not quite true.  A nuke is actually very, very simple to build unless you just <span style="font-style: italic">want</span> to make it complex, and can still be very effective.  All it really takes is a disk of lithium, a disk of polonium, the proper type of uranium, a steel rod and a small amount of plastic explosive.  Getting ahold of those is fairly difficult for your average civilian, but for a government, and even most terrorist groups, it's not that hard.

Well, there have been lengthy scholarly volumnes written by people far more knowledgeable than you or I about what we *could* have done in Vietnam that might have changed the outcome. I have somewhere buried in a box a book I inherited written by a General during the time, it's 700ish pages. I've skimmed through parts of it, and a portion talks about the initial stages of the Hearts&Minds campaign, and how effective that was until the CIA got involved and changed it. Maybe if that had come out differently it would have altered the whole conflict. Who knows.

I don't know really much of anything about targeting doctrine, but wasn't it also a large problem that our planes got shot down a *lot*? Up until the first guided bombs and the Linebacker-II campaign, which was very late (too late?) in the game.

Fusing? Huh? No, you could not LITERALLY put Little Boy onto a truck and blow it up, that wasn't what I was trying to say. The Little Boy comparison was to refute the miniturization arguement. Little Boy was still pretty big.  The point was that if a bomb could be made to fit into a truck using 1940's inexperience and technology, that making something small enough to cart around today would be a minor undertaking.

The difficult part is in obtaining the uranium/plutonium and purifying it. Specifically seperating out the more explosive-friendly isotopes from the isotopes that don't go "Boom" so readily. That's what all those hundreds of centrifuges we've been hearing about with the whole WMD discussion about Iraq and Libya are for. Once you have that, making it explode is easy. The technology to do that is found in any shaped-charge anti-tank missile. Making it explode with maximum efficiency...well, that does take a lot more work. But it doesn't need to be super efficient to kill a lot of people. Again, Little Boy (and Fat Man) wasted most of their material. They still worked incredibly well.

Oh, I'm not doubting that. It also would hardly be something exclusive to China. I don't think ANY country that got nuked wouldn't be willing to return the favor. Saving face is hardly a concept that only the chinese understand.  But invading a country with nuclear weapons, and forcing their backs up against the wall is just an invitation for disaster. The simple point was that a Chinese-Indian conflict is getting into the way-out-there hypothetical range. Well, that and...if China did invade India, and if it was kept entirely conventional, why would the US intervene, and how is it a rationalization for increasing the size of our armed forces? We've kind of gotten WAY off topic here, and that was the original point of debate.

There actually was a fairly large quake that hit the northern midwest area some time ago (150 years? Something like that, not in more recent memory like the '06 SF quake). So even with no fault lines, it has happened and therefore could happen again. I wouldn't especially want to test the results, it would be bad...but I'd bet you we'd fare better than most places would.
<br />

<br />
You see things like the Ohio river flooding 10 feet above its banks, it wipes out some farms, some people are left homeless, lots of monetary damage...and 5 people killed. The yellow river goes an inch above its banks, and it seems as though a thousand people flop over dead. This is not something limited to China. It seems like it happens everywhere in the world except here. Natural disasters which do property damage in the US wipe out whole segments of the population almost everywhere else in the world, even "First World" countries...a couple years ago, Italy had floods that killed a few hundred people.

That's all I was really trying to say. I think that you are taking the more urbanized areas which are by necesity more advanced, and extrapolating it to the country at large to a greater degree than is true, but the basic idea is a simple one. Heck, there are a lot of areas of the US which have been "settled" for years, but lack essential services like running water and electricity.

Was thinking on the subject of Hong Kong last night, and forgot to include it...to illustrate the difference, you just need to look at manufacturing. Even products made today, if you buy something made in say, Shanghai, the label will say "Made in China". If you buy something made in Hong Kong the label will say "Made in Hong Kong". So, even after China took control of the governance of HK, it still remains pretty independant of the mainland.

The whole terrorism thing comes from bad movie cliches like John Travolta in "Swordfish" with his (well, his character's, at least) claims of being able to buy nuclear warheads wholesale on the black market. Terrorist groups are extremely well funded, by and large. If it could be done, it would have been done. So clearly it isn't quite so easy. If they could *get* a weapon, actually using it wouldn't be that difficult. Getting the nuclear material isn't even incredibly hard. My high school chemistry teacher had some cakes of dilute uranium-bearing ore that he used to demonstrate the function of geiger counters and x-ray film and the like. Turning that into a working weapon...that's the real trick. Doing that takes things which terrorist organizations are either not good at, or would be unwise to attempt. Things like staying low profile, or concentrating your membership in a small area, or keeping up with high-maintenance machine tools, etc.<span class="gensmall"></span>

For folks interested in the targeting doctrine look up Operation Rolling Thunder.  Targets were given priority.  The highest strategic priority was the "Alpha" list.  However, this list was avoided.  Industrial targets were on the "Alpha" list.  This list wasn't hit until late and not very much.  Washinton avoided it so as not to @#%$ off the civilian population (or so they thought).  Ports were also avoided (also on the "Alpha" list) so as not to @#%$ of the USSR.  Basically, politics got in the way of military decisions.<span class="gensmall"></span>

<br />
Well, yes you're right...however I have to tack on a large "but" to my response.  At the time the war was going on Hanoi probably had more air defense artillary (AAA (anti-aicraft arty) and SAMS (surface-to-air missles) than any other spot in the world.  A smart leader, who knows his enemy doesn't really have his heart in the war, and knows that a political disaster (like shooting a shriek anti-rader missle, used to kill SAM radars through a hospital window) is going to be a very effective deterant.
<br />

<br />
Additionally, there was a lot more technological parity back then.  The N.viets were being supplied by Russia and getting first-line SAM equipment, which at the time was SA-2's, SA-3's and maybe SA-5's (although those might have come later).  Today, and SA-2's and 3's are pretty much a joke vs the countermeasure packages carried by our aircraft, and our ability to kill the radar systems that these missiles rely on for guidance is vastly more advanced.  Stealth technology was still a wet dream back in those days too, so our aircraft were much more vulnerable to being detected.
<br />

<br />
So if I'm the N.viets and I move an infantry division into a key city, I'm going to camp them next to a schoolyard, and set up a few SAM sites around them.  If my enemy (the US in this case) wants to roll the dice and risk blowing up school and the insuing media fallout, it's a gamble they were more than willing to take.  
<br />

<br />
Thus, we cant kill the SAMS, and the SAMS protect the infantry without the risk of dropping a bomb on 100 school children.  See how it all starts to roll togather nicely?

The US would intervene for the same reasons we intervened in Kuwait when Iraq invaded them (although you could argue we did it to protect an ally and a source of oil).  The US would intervene for the same reasons we intervened in the Serbia/Kosovo situation (where we had nothing at all to gain).  The US would intervene for the same reasons we intervened in World War I, and World War II, to support our allies (India is considered an ally that we are on good political terms with).
<br />

<br />
As far as it's relevence to the topic of a strong armed forces, it ties in with the ability of the US military to fight two wars at once.  We could stop a Chinese invasion of India, but we couldn't stop a Chinese invasion of India AND keep a strong enough presence in Iraq.  Thus, I say the military cannot currently fulfill the ability to fight a two front war.

Ever seen what an F-5 tornado can do?  I have, first hand.  Living the first 23 years of my life in tornado ally, thats not to uncommon.  I watched an F-5 spiral down the I-35 freeway for about 20 miles.  It was so powerful it pulled chunks of the freeway out of the road-bed.  It marched down that freeway...and then it stopped.  Right over the little community of Jerald, Texas.  Thirty minutes later, there was no Jerald, Texas, and there were 60+ dead.  
<br />

<br />
More severe tornado outbreaks have killed 100's in a day.  So who's to say how many people a nautral disaster should kill?  If you're not prepared for something, it doesn't matter how good your infastructure is.  Again though, compare ANYONE to the US and it'll look like they have a weak infastrucutre.  That doesn't make it true though.

Not really.  Most are just above the level of armed rabble...and some don't even get there.  With a few very notable exceptions (Al Quida would be on, although much of their funding is history now), terrorrists are poor as hell...but they live in an area where every Tom, %$#@! and Abdhula owns an AK-47.  Don't equate having guns with good funding.  Any idiot can pick up a gun if there are an assload of guns lying around.  Its training that comes into play after that.  The US has lots of training money (compared to terrorist) thats why lots of terrorists die and not very many US troops die whenever they get into a prolonged firefight.  
<br />

<br />
Here's a quote a buddy of mine sent me recently from Afghanistan after I asked him if the AQ/Taliban are any good.
<br />

<br />
"Heeeeellllll No!  You should see these guys King (thats me).  They don't have the first concept of tactics.  Things that are first nature even to intel @#%$ like you like cover-and-move and buddy-fire.  They dont know anything about it.  Sometimes they just stand there like statues and empty clips until they over-heat their barrals or until one of us shoots them.  The only time any of our guys are getting hit is by accident.  Throw enough bullets at us and eventually someone gets hit.  
<br />

<br />
Example.  A few months ago before the snow hit we were on patrol in (removed) because a (removed) had tipped us off to AQ in the area.  So we're in 3 Humvees and it's dusk, like maybe an hour of light left.  Someone shoots an RPG at us and misses by like 100 meters and we come under small arms fire so we jump out and find cover.  We basically just lay around smoking cigarettes and @#%$ until the sun goes behind the mountains when it gets dark quick.  We pop on the night vision gogs, and see about a dozen rag heads up on this mountain side maybe 300 meters up and away from us.  Dude, the are just standing in the open, not even taking cover, and firing at us.  We killed eight of them and the rest took off.  After it was all said and done, we had fired a total of 133 rounds, or something like that.  We went up and searched the area they were in and by the next morning we had collected several RPGs that didnt work, a bunch of AKs and like 1300 shell casings.  These retards fired 1300 rounds at us, and hit nothing!  They couldn't even hit the Humvees, I think we found like a total of 13 bullet holes."
<br />

<br />
I cleaned that up a little but it's pretty much word for word.  Most terrorists have %$#@! for funding.  They are able to bully the locals into giving them stuff, and can usually scrape togather enough cash to buy guns and food, but thats about it.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Didn't Bush the Elder directly mention this at some point? The big concern was that if Saddam was willing to take Kuwait, that moving into Saudi Arabia was in the cards, and that would give Iraq control over what, 70% of the oil in the mideast? We were entering a phase of not liking him (instead of selling arms to him) already before he invaded, IIRC.

Interesting example, a tornado...a phenomena which is almost exclusively limited to the US. I did not of course mean that natural disasters NEVER kill people in the US, just the rate at which similar incidents inflict fatalities is so much lower here. If hurricane Andrew had instead been typhoon Andrew and washed up in southern India, it would have been tens of thousands (hundreds maybe?) of people killed, instead of the relatively few we had here.
<br />

<br />
I consider disaster preparedness to be an intrinsic aspect of infrastructure. We do it better here than anywhere else. The recent San Diego fires notwithstanding.

Well, in the similar vein that having AK-47's doesn't imply good funding, it also doesn't imply good marksmanship or good training. By well funded, I did not mean hundreds of millions of dollars/pounds/whathaveyou...but taking people like Osama, whose personal worth was last estimated in the $20 million range or so, that's good for a pretty long haul when all you need to buy are the weapons. I don't imagine that most terrorist groups have group dental coverage. Then there is the opium running and such. If buying warheads was as easy as some of the pundits would have us believe, it really should have happened by now.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Now that we have the precision, it's expected every time, like the bombs are magical or something. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

Yup.  Consider in WW2 that the bombers carried nothing but dumb bombs, and they bombed from 20,000 feet using nothing but optical bomb sights...no computers, no laser targeting.  Whole chunks of cities were bombed flat in Germany.  Especially once we started getting tired of fighting and started using incindiary bombs.  Do some reading on the fire-bombing raids late in WW2 in Bremen and a few other cities.  Fires got so powerful they generated hurricane force winds and you couldn't breathe anywhere near the fire because it was consuming all the oxygen in the area.

Again, as far disasters go, natural or not, comparing any country except Canada and maybe the UK to the US will make them look bad.  Still doesn't have much to do with their overall infastrucutre.<span class="gensmall"></span>
