<br />

<br />
Quite an interesting read with some valid points even though I dont agree with everything said;
<br />

<br />
Open letter to all who are attending the EQ summit and those who love EverQuest, 
<br />

<br />
The problem with EQ is not Word of Warcraft or City of Heroes. The problem with EQ is not the hundreds of thousands of loyal players who've paid the bills for EQ for over 5 years. I submit to you the problem with EQ is SOE. All of the major problems of EQ find their genesis in SOE and in their subsequent mismanagement. How then did the most successful online game in history go so wrong? 
<br />

<br />
Let's examine some of the problems and how we got to this point: 
<br />

<br />

<br />
THE PROBLEMS 
<br />

<br />
DOMINANCE OF THE RAID CENTRIC MENTALITY and THE RISE OF THE UBERGUILD 
<br />

<br />
EverQuest was never designed to be a raiding game. It was designed to primarily focus on group interdependence in a persistent online world. The EQ Devs were caught off guard by the tenacity of the uberguild phenomena. These guilds consumed content like locusts and in many cases actually tested major encounters. Uberguilds were also consuming content faster then the Devs could create it and they complained quite vociferously to SOE on their websites. Somehow the uberguild members got elevated to superstar status given all of the attention from SOE. Wanting to see the latest exploits of the uberguilds players would live vicariously through them by visiting their websites. Imagine gamers in a fantasy world fantasizing about being Furor and killing creatures they could only dream about killing? It’s perhaps the ultimate irony of online gaming. 
<br />

<br />
Somehow as EQ morphed into a "raiding" game and the little guy with a job and a family got forgotten and left behind. With people like Furor and other guild leaders complaining the loudest, the squeaky wheel got the proverbial grease and EQ expansions starting with Planes of Power officially became raid centric with 80% of its zones only available by completing trials and flags. If you wanted to truly succeed and see the content in EQ you had to join a uber guild and raid 6 hours per day in a quasi-military like fashion. Despite being a small minority of the playerbase all of EQ's resources were focused on keeping the uberguilds satiated with content at the expense of normal and casual gamers. 
<br />

<br />
No longer is EQ an online game about grouping to solve quests and adventures. It is primarily about raiding. As many have pointed out the gap between the normal/casual gamer and the powergamer/uberguilds has never been wider. At one point in Norrath we were all just players. We all had the same chance to go to Lower Guk and Nagafen's Lair. No longer is that the case. EQ has become a caste system of the pampered uber vs. the great unwashed normal gamer. The EQ playerbase has become polarized and it's destroying the game. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
THE DEATH OF EPIC STORY TELLING AND THE RISE OF THE WAYFARERS 
<br />

<br />
EverQuest was always a game about humans, elves, dwarves and dragons. That is the stuff that high fantasy is made of. Many on this thread have brought up this point. Scars of Velious was the pinnacle of epic storytelling with the battle between the Dragons, the Dwarves and the Frost Giants. Online gaming reached heights unseen with the massive battle of the Ring War and the ultimate quest of the Coldain Shawl. EverQuest was at its finest. Then Luclin was released with the introduction of something very un-fantasy: aliens from space and cuddly cat people living on the moon. Luclin also heralded the dreaded concept of timesinks and guilds that would "own" content by keeping smaller guilds out in zones like Vex Thall. 
<br />

<br />
With the release of Planes of Power at least the designers focused on EQ's previously successful lore with it's tale of the gods despite its obvious pandering to uberguilds with 80% of content closed off to the normal gamer. 
<br />

<br />
Enter Morden Rasp and his band of followers, the Wayfarers Brotherhood. These characters are the new salesmen of Norrath. Got a new expansion? Who you gonna call? Why Morden Rasp of course. No longer would epic figures of Norrathian history like Firiona Vie and Lany's T`vil make history with their deeds. The Wayfarers have been the worst example of epic storytelling I've ever seen in an online game. They are a clever, convenient device used to market and sell an expansion. EQ used to be a game about slaying powerful dragons and entering the planes of the gods. Now it's about working 9-5 for Morden Rasp and his Wayfarers. Instead of being a part of unfolding history we are subject to monthly snippets of text from Morden. Never has the dream of EQ been so betrayed by such a shabby storyline. 
<br />

<br />
Finally you have Gates of Discord, with a plot that makes no sense. You have unpronounceable zone and NPC names that sound more like exotic food then Norrath lore. More loot, trials and flags for the Time enabled crowd. Again the normal player is left behind but expected to buy the new expansion and foot the bill for the fun of a few. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
IGNORING THE PLAYERBASE 
<br />

<br />
For years the EQ playerbase has been posting on the problems of EQ but their cries have fallen on deaf ears. The cancellation of the official EQ Forums was the beginning of an isolationist, bunker mentality of the SOE. In time Yantis would start buying out all of the various class and community forums. Delicious irony since it backfired in their faces. Now we had Dracula (Yantis) in charge of the blood bank (the player forums). Five years later SOE has re-opened the Forums and seems to "care". Somewhere at the SOE office in San Diego a light bulb finally went off and they realized that supporting the community of players is essential for success. 
<br />

<br />
Even at FanFaire the attitude of the EQ Devs has grown more defensive and obstinate as they refuse to discuss many legitimate issues raised by players who've spend thousands of dollars to travel there. SOE has squandered the advice and suggestions of it's customers for years now. Why? Because they were the only game in town and could get away with it. No more. 
<br />

<br />
For deeper insight read this illuminating article authored by SOE’s Raph Koster and Rich Vogel entitled “How to Manage a Large-Scale Online Gaming Community”: 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/gdc_2002_community_files/frame.htm" target="_blank">http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/gdc_2002_community_files/frame.htm</a> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
WHAT HAPPENED TO GAMEMASTERS, QUESTS, EVENTS, and the BOTB? 
<br />

<br />
Shortly after SOE took over Verant, one of the biggest deceptions ever perpetrated on the EQ playerbase was introduced: the Legends premium server. Players would now be treated based on how much they were paying for EQ. No longer would dynamic GM events ever happen on regular servers as server assigned GM's were removed. If you wanted live events and GM's then you had to pay the big bucks on Legends. This was the beginning of the end of EQ as we know it. 
<br />

<br />
The Quest Troupe was also dissolved so that Legends would appear more attractive. Around the same time SOE decided to eliminate the Questmaster positions. The Best of the Best Events were also cancelled. The spirit of EQ which was that anything could happen and that gods could visit Norrath was over. Gone were the altered datasets for zones during Halloween and other occasions. With all these changes, it seemed the very lifeblood and magic of EverQuest had been removed just to save a few bucks. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
PROFITS BEFORE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME 
<br />

<br />
SOE has always put profits before the integrity of their product and now the chickens are coming home to roost. GoD is easily the least popular of any EQ expansion to date and SOE in their typical "money grubbin" style has yet another expansion waiting in the wings to extract more cash from the players. The problem is the players have finally caught on and have drawn a line in the sand. Enough is enough. 
<br />

<br />
EQ has never been more profitable with the myriad of services that SOE now charges for such as character transfers, first name changes and Legends. Smedley loves to brag about how many subscribers EQ has. Why then has SOE cutback on so many of its staff like developers, testers, and Gamemasters? Why have they outsourced GM jobs to India and the UK? 
<br />

<br />
Things were not always this way at SOE as this Business 2.0 article points out: 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0,17863,514908,00.html" target="_blank">http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0,17863,514908,00.html</a> 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.adamparnes.com/archives/00000091.html" target="_blank">http://www.adamparnes.com/archives/00000091.html</a> 
<br />

<br />

<br />
"EverQuest also relies on 47 staffers to continually add items and quests to the game; another 128 "game masters" function as customer service reps and patrol the world answering questions." 
<br />

<br />

<br />
SOE now has just a handful of in-house staffers and GM's compared to the numbers they used to have. No wonder game instability and lack of Customer service are some of the biggest complaints players have with SOE. 
<br />

<br />
EQ has been a cash cow for SOE and its only profitable venture so far. In fact EQ subscribers have been subsidizing the development of EQ2 for years now at the expense of the very game they are paying for. Most of the problems with EQ can be attributed to lack of funding for proper testing of expansions that end up released unfinished and full of bugs. It’s also common knowledge that there are only a few actual employees left working on EQ live. They are overworked and overburdened and the results show. 
<br />

<br />
Consider how understaffed SOE is at this moment and then read the bravado from Smedley from the same Business 2.0 article: 
<br />

<br />

<br />
"Would you believe we've generated over $1 million in revenue simply from moving characters?" Smedley marvels. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
It’s not too late to fix EQ. They need to listen to the whole community not just the voices of a privileged few. Here are a few suggestions many of them similar to what has already been posted: 
<br />

<br />

<br />
THE SOLUTIONS 
<br />

<br />
FIX THE BUGS and STOP IGNORING YOUR CUSTOMERS 
<br />

<br />
Before you release any more expansions fix the bugs first. Make EQ stable before you add one more iota of content. Address the concerns that various class boards have been raising for years now. Learn some humility and start to listen. No more excuses. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
POPULATE OLD UNUSED ZONES WITH NEW CONTENT 
<br />

<br />
No more expansions! Less is more. Most zones are empty across Norrath. Use the existing geography to realize the dream of a living, thriving Norrath complete with political and factional intrigue. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
STOP PANDERING TO UBERGUILDS and FOCUS ON CONTENT FOR NORMAL PEOPLE 
<br />

<br />
The gap between uberguilds and normal players has never been wider. This is the number one problem facing EQ. For all the attention you have lavished on them, the uberguilds are leaving EQ fast and furious. Focus on content for the great majority of normal to casual gamers before it's too late. Start supporting small guilds that are non-elemental. No more flags or trials. Create alternate pathways for success in this game that don’t involve 72 person raids. Create amazing dungeons that everyone can use like Lower Guk and Nagafen’s Lair. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
FIRE MORDEN RASP and CREATE A MORE COMPELLING EPIC STORYLINE 
<br />

<br />
Bring back the spirit of old EQ with a return to ancient struggles between the Dragons, the Giants and the various factions of Norrath. Morden Rasp and his band of merry Wayfarers need to go. Morden…you’re fired! 
<br />

<br />

<br />
HIRE MORE DEVS, QA and GAMEMASTERS 
<br />

<br />
Start using the profits of EQ to hire more Devs, Quality Assurance and Gamemasters. The poor quality and instability of EQ is directly proportional to how much money has been spent on staffing. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
PUT THE QUEST BACK INTO EVERQUEST 
<br />

<br />
EverQuest needs a complete revamp to its Quest system. Make quests meaningful and worthwhile. More live and scripted events too. Create quests worthy of the name EverQuest! 
<br />

<br />

<br />
MAKE EVERQUEST FUN AGAIN 
<br />

<br />
Somehow EQ stopped being fun. Everyone has said this over and over. EQ needs a serious does of fun injected into its lifeless body. The problem is that there are so many pressing issues that need to be addressed the fun/cool factor of EQ has long been neglected due to inadequate staffing and resources. The 5th Anniversary was a step in the right direction with the Fabled drops. Every month in Norrath should be a celebration of adventure and quests! 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Can EverQuest be saved? It seems very unlikely with SOE at the helm. Just like the Titanic took hours to do a 180 degree turn I seriously doubt that SOE can turn the ship around and put it back on course. The iceberg of WoW is looming ahead and many will abandon ship when the time comes. The real problem is the culture of corporate arrogance and chronic under funding at SOE which created this terminal patient known as EQ. At least Smedley has finally realized there is a problem. Perhaps that is a start. 
<br />

<br />
I urge Woody and everyone that has the good fortune to attend the SOE guild summit to please stop and think about what's good for everyone who plays EverQuest not just the privileged few. It seems that SOE has again pandered to high level guilds and have invited many of their guild leaders to attend in an effort to stop the hemorrhaging. Maybe next month we can have a “player summit” where average players get to speak to SOE. Let me remind them and SOE that casual gamers subsidize the powergamers in this game. Soon there may not be any left to pay the bills for your fun. 
<br />

<br />
In the final analysis all that SOE understands is money. They feel entitled to your hard earned dollars despite releasing substandard expansions. Those of us that still love EQ need to stand firm and resolute. Boycott the new expansion. Vote with your dollars and send a strong message to Smedley and SOE: the status quo in EverQuest is no longer acceptable. Business as usual will no longer suffice. 
<br />

<br />
I'd like to close with a gem of a quote from John Smedley from a 1999 interview with Gamespot. This quote is stunning in light of the current state of EQ: 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/btg_y2k/p19_01.html" target="_blank">http://www.gamespot.com/features/btg_y2k/p19_01.html</a> 
<br />

<br />
Gamespot: If there's one thing wrong with the gaming industry you'd want to change in the new millennium, what would it be and why? 
<br />

<br />
John: Stop rushing games! Great games take time and must be refined. To me, the best people in the business at realizing this are at Blizzard. Let's all learn a lesson from them. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Obviously Smedley should have heeded his own advice. Sadly I fear it may be too late.<br />

				Interesting article, and alot of truth in it. All things aside from uber guild to casual player, I think the idea to boycott the next expansion is something everyone should do. The only reason GoD sold so well is because they had to add harder content for those EP guilds, especially the ones that had nothing better to do but farm Time.

Remember how bugged Time was when the first guilds got in, and PoP had been out for how long? GoD was even worse, and I am sure OoW isn't going to turn the trend around.<br />

With people like Furor and other guild leaders complaining the loudest, the squeaky wheel got the proverbial grease and EQ expansions starting with Planes of Power officially became raid centric with 80% of its zones only available by completing trials and flags. If you wanted to truly succeed and see the content in EQ you had to join a uber guild and raid 6 hours per day in a quasi-military like fashion. Despite being a small minority of the playerbase all of EQ's resources were focused on keeping the uberguilds satiated with content at the expense of normal and casual gamers. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

Bingo.
<br />

<br />
According to the site that tracks PoP/Discord progress, 378 guilds are EP+.  If you say 100 people per guild, that's 37.8K or <span style="font-weight: bold">8.4%</span> of 450K of all customers are experiencing PoP and it's two years old.  That percentage is even more sickening for Discord.  Funny thing is when EQ was first released, there were only two major raids in the game -- Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox.  (EDIT: Sky, Fear, and Hate existed, but still a low percentage of raid content compaired to non-raid content.) Power gamers have changed that, but are less than 10% of the player base.  Now those same power gamers are giving Blizzard free advertising for WoW. heh  Why produce Discord when less than 10% of your customers haven't even cleared PoTime after two years (and LDoN upgrades)?
<br />

<br />
The other thing that is hurting EQ is repetition.  Much of the game is reduced to doing the same thing over and over with rare accomplishments of something different.  Exp for weeks of played time to get all your AA's.  Farm zones like VT, EP's, or PoTime for months on end.  I think people play EQ for two reasons: (1) their friends, (2) lack an alternative game.  City of Heroes is just a small taste of what's going to happen to EQ when WoW hits.
<br />

<br />
EverQuest is ancient in terms of computer games.  Most people do not play the same computer game for years on end.  Sure, some aspects of EQ have changed like toon power, but the basic aspect of grinding exp or grinding raids hasn't changed since Kunark.<br />

				Except for him being so anti-raid, I already posted 80% of that in the 5R forums about what Zak should bring up at the Sony Summit.  I didn't spell it out quite so elequently, but its amazing how our analysis of what is right and wrong with EQ, is the same.
<br />

<br />
This guy is right about a lot.  Raiding isn't so evil though, as the content remains for family guilds to conquer when mudflation inevitably floats all ships higher... to mix two sayings.  The point being that raid content becomes family content given a year or two, and when games last this long, it becomes a legit plan for making content for all players.<br />

				I think Wolf would be surprised at how similar most of the issues he's brought up are exactly what we have asked Chop to discuss with the devs as well. I am pretty sure most of these issues are being brought up in every single guild invited to attend.
<br />

<br />
Despite what people seem to think, most raiders love this game the way it was just like the "casual" gamer. Do we go through it faster? Sure we do, it's our own competition. Who can get where faster, just because we play the game differently doesn't make us the problem.
<br />

<br />
In some ways I think we have an even better understanding of just what exactly is broke in the game and it started with Luclin. We get to it faster, we beta test their product & get kicked in the %@$# after we do. We find the bugs, we find the holes, we find the broken scripts. We are unpaid beta testers & tools for the devs to fix things. Too bad they don't listen most of the time.<br />

				You guys realize that however RIGHT this guy may be...it won't change anything. They don't listen. They won't listen. I know. They are making money off of the game...sure, but it's not even close to a "priority" for Sony.  IT WORKS LIKE IT IS. You see how much money they are making? Why would they make drastic changes to a 5 year old game when they have a new one coming out? The only thing they'll be doing to EQ is phasing it out. They'll increase the price of EQ and have EQ2's price lower...they'll make their money and listen to players this time....for about 2 years. I don't know how much Verant leaving really had to do with a lot except for the crappy content. I know as a Guide, we actually got upgraded in the things we could do when SoE took over. Sure, that was because they saw us as free labor...but I didn't mind. *shrug* I don't know what this guy wants but if he thinks he can "change" something. It's been tried...many times. You don't get attention like this...you get it by having an uber guild threaten to boycott the game.... *cough* FoH *cough*<br />

				Who cares about FOH or Afterlife, the vast majority of players never heard of them and never read the server specific boards.  The article is dead-on, the focus on raiding has put EQ in the place that it is to day.  I do understand that most the readers of this board are the hardcore, i.e. the raiders, and that is the case with more boards so feedback to SOE is skewed.
<br />

<br />
Raiding simply has too many benefits, too many incentives to make it the most viable way to progress.   In many, many cases, raiding is the only way to advance.    Raiding not only gives far superior gear than can be obtained through any other source but it gives additional benefits that it never should have given; access to the best experience zones, access to zones that allow farming for cash, access to zones that allow quests for more uber items, access to zones for tradeskill drops, and the list goes on.
<br />

<br />
Raiding has created a caste system, a system where people are defined by their guild tags.   Players are assumed to be more skilled because they are in Uber_Guild_A or Uber_Guild_B.   This is, of course, far from the truth.   EQ is one of the few games where the skill and dedication of the individual players is not reflected in the rewards and recognition they achieve.    To take it further, the uber player begins to believe they are the superior player which to a degree is true because in an item-centric game, gear can be greater than skill.
<br />

<br />
Expansion after expansion has cemented this idea.  Flag, keys, and zones block by massive time sink rquirements has not only alienated the general player population but also made it near impossible for the player to catch-up to the raider in any significant manner.   The Uber player will routinely throw out terms like Mud Inflation and LDON as means for the normal player to advance.   And while this is true in theory, it fails in practice.   Where mud inflation has made it possible for a small guild to tackle a target with 12, it made it possible for the uber to farm it while 2 boxing.   
<br />

<br />
While LDON was really the most complete expansion to date but it is laced with its own problem.   The "Ubers" complained to the point that the itemization was nerfed, no way we can have a player spending hundreds upon hundreds of hours to be remotely equal to someone that killed a half dozen uber mobs.   The LDON raids aren't even doable by the people that enjoy doing LDON, another bone and benefit tossed to the uber guilds.  And the "ubers" cite LDON as a realistic path to outfit a guild that is too small to progress through PoP.   Just another sign they have no idea what they are talking about.   It takes 60 missions in LDON to fill one equipment slot (doing LDON prior to level 60 is pretty much wasted effort anyway).    I have as many LDON mission as just about anyone on this server and I am not even close to being geared equal to an EP geared player.
<br />

<br />
Pretty simple, Raiding should be fun, should allow progression, and should be supported.    It shouldnt be the only method.   Raiding should be relegated to the status of tradeskilling, a valid method of playing the game that largely coexists with the default progression path; that of the single group.<br />

				Well said Segal.  I agree 100%.  
<br />

<br />
I enjoy raiding myself but I can recognize how raiding as the only viable progression path has SoE sending emails to customer to invite a friend to play.  (lol anyone else get that email?  I've been around for 4 years and that's the first direct email I've received from them soliciting my support to get more subscribers.)
<br />

<br />
90% of the SoE customers will never get past the RZ encounter in it's current form.  Even with mudflation, most guilds don't have 30 people online at once.  PoP takes NUMBERS that cannot be made up with LDoN gear and Discord AA's.  Even after two years and multiple expansions, the EP's are off limits to most of their customers.  Discord is an utter failure.  Guilds like AL and FoH actually beta-tested the expansion before it went live and now those same guilds advertise for the competition.  SoE needs to realize that the uber crowd can't pay their bills.  There isn't enough of them.<br />

				While these are all good points, let me smash everyone in the face with reality before you get your hopes up.
<br />

<br />
1. This game cannot be fixed. Ever. To do so would require rewriting it from scratch, and essentially creating a new game. That's EQ2 (or so they hope). They will never put enough programming money and effort into Everquest to fix all of its problems, because it will be far too hard, cost far too much money, and take so damn long that they'll never be able to finish it. It is the proverbial impossible programming project.
<br />

<br />
2. They do not listen. Their agenda is not the agenda of the players. They cannot change, SOE has the Dilbert mentality, and the PHBs don't give a @#%$ about this game or its players and they never will. They are incapable of making the decisions necessary to return control of this game to the developers and the players. This summit is 4 years too late to be meaningful.
<br />

<br />
3. No matter what they do, they cannot possibly being Everquest up to the level of the next generation of MMORPGs that will be hitting the market. It's bloody obvious that EQ is going to get decimated by its competition in the upcoming months, and while it may never die, it's days of being in even the top5 MMORPGs are numbered.
<br />

<br />
I'd honestly say that Everquest isn't worth the effort. Spend the time choosing wisely from the various alternatives, not trying to help Dr. Frankenstein fix a walking corpse.<br />

				I do agree that the problems seem unsurmountable, because they have created this over serveral years and to turn the tide is pretty tough.  I do, however, expect EQ to remain pretty active for a few more years.  Alot of the new MMORPGs will end up not being everything that is expected.  I am looking forward to EQ2, its 24 man raid limit, and its more intimate game play.
<br />

<br />
But I can think of some quick changes that would address alot of the issues that the general player base has:
<br />

<br />
(1) Alternate Access Quest to enter Sol Ro.
<br />
(2) Add named that drop ornate to HoH and PoTorment (not mobs that have AE DoTs and mana drain, i.e. the wulrons in HoH).
<br />
(3) Do something about the trdeskills dropping in the elementals.  Best alternative is to make an exact replica of those tradeskill items that drop off mobs in the first tier of GOD.
<br />
(4) Increase the named spawns in LDON Hard
<br />
(5) Reverse the nerf on drops and experience in LDON
<br />
(6) Radically change the LDON raids, the people they are intended for dont want to do them.   Make it an 18 person raid for people that have completed roughly 100 LDONs.
<br />
(7) Reduce the spawn time of all Boss mobs in Kunark from 3 days to 12 hours.
<br />
(8) Reduce the spawn time of all Boss mobs in SOV/Luclin to 24-48 hours with +/- 6 hour randomizer.
<br />
(9) Add a sell back option for LDON gear that gives 50% of the AP cost back to the player.  This makes LDON viable for pre-65 players.
<br />
(10) Reduce the agrso range for LDON Guk adventures to the same as Mistmoore.
<br />
(11) Instance the elemental planes and remove the boss mobs from one instance so it is experience only.   Created alternate entry quests for those zones.
<br />
(12) Un-nerf the named spawns in Chardok B, make them 25% more common than they are currently.   Upgrade the final cloak quest to give a damn good reward.
<br />
(13) Add a random chance that the fabled mobs will spawn
<br />
(14) Eliminate Slot 8 Augs, change slot 8 to slot 7.   Uber people already have uber gear, they dont need their own set of uber LDON items.
<br />

<br />
Just a few ideas.<br />

Thanks to those people who DO have the time to chew through the game, you now have 6+ expansions worth of content.  SoV would have just now been released if they only had to cater to your progression schedule. I'm sure there are plenty of things in EQ that you haven't seen that are available to you.<br />

Yes, I started playing one in the mid 70s call "Chainmail" that allowed you to do that sort of thing.   Going back before that, most fantasy type movies / novels / etc.. would generally have a solo conqueror.  In fact, the only game I have ever played (of hundreds) that required more than 6-8 people to do anything is EQ.  Though I do see the need for raids, 72 people is beyond moronic, 24 people is plenty.
<br />

<br />
Not even the new games are going to continue in this vein.  Raid limit for Eq2 is 24, raid limit for WoW is 35 (or so I am told).<br />

				Yes Chainmail / D and D are built around adventures that can be conquered by 4 to 6 (typical) players, however how long does it take for a group to go from level 1 to level 20 and realistically able to defeat 'hard' stuff?  A long time.  So even if EQ was based on the 6 man group doing everything, people with little or no time to play (so they could gather the appropriate strength and items) wouldn't be killing it anyway until it was older than dirt.<br />
