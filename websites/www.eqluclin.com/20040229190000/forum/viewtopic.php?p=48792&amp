As i believe Poppa already stated, they are not protesting because they are not happy about the US in Iraq, they are protesting because the Grand Ayatolla Cleric told them to, for the sake of elections sooner then the US believes possible. Did the news in England leave that point out?

<br />
I will give you this one. The US was the "last frontier" for lack of mad cow disease. When it was suddenly in the US, the meat market got hit so hard so fast, they had to find the quickest route to show people it was safe. Im sure one major thought, was to show the world that it wasnt a US cow, and it wasnt US cow feed. US Beef is safe. Personally i was never worried, I ate plenty of beef without a worry. But it hurt the beef economy bad, they had to do something to try and fix the problem.

<br />
Last point. The US does report ally deaths. There are many fewer then US soldier deaths, which is why you dont hear nearly as much about them. But yes, they are reported by the US media. Putting the slant on the news saying that almost all are "friendly fire" is England's own way of making the US look worse and gain public support against the US. Just as the lack of reporting by US media makes it seem as though the US is doing all the work. Which most everyone knows is not true. 
<br />
I really dont think the US media is censored, even by omission, as much as they and any media source anywhere, just leave out(omit) the whole truth to gain the public support in the way they want.<span class="gensmall"></span>

In England they speak of how poorly Iraq is doing, how people are starving, how the people live under marshall law.  In America the news tells of how all the schools are open, the water is clean, the government is only months from holding free and open elections, how happy the people are.  If every one is so happy why do they show constant protests in Iraq back in England and never show any protests here?

I don't know what U.S. news you've been reading, but I've read stories of the power grids failing, 50% capacity and blackouts.  I've seen pictures and read stories of all the protests that happen every day.  Some of the signs protestors held basically said "Thank you USA. Now leave Iraq."  If they want that, fine.  We'll just label it Afghanistan 2.  After the Soviet Union left Afghanistan in 1989, it was in ruins because of like a decade of guerilla war between the two sides (well 3 sides, since the USA supplied the goods).  The regional warlords screwed up the remainder and the Taliban eventually came to power subjecting the country to strict religious rule that deprived them of any sort of advancement.  Iraq would fall into the same quagmire and we'd have to bomb it again in another decade.  Transferring from a dictatorship to a more egalitarian form of government is not easy.  Look at Russia and several of the former Soviet Bloc countries, Haiti, and some African countries.

Another odd thing in America.  You will hear a reference to jews every single day in America.  Jewish people have very cunningly managed to make sure every one remembers them.  I have yet to go a day in America without hearing some reference to jewish people.

This kind of reinforces my notion that Europeans are still anti-Semitic.  I'm not Jewish, but I have several friends who are and a few of them come from places other than the U.S.  Alluding to a "Jewish conspiracy" in the U.S. is so played out.  The Jews are a vocal community and are well represented in most sectors of life here in the U.S.  Can you blame them for wanting to be heard?  They were silenced in Europe during the first half of the 20th century and they were almost exterminated.  In the 1940s and 1950s you would never see anything about Jews in the U.S. media.  News of death camp discoveries in Germany and Poland were a small corner in the back pages of even the New York Times.  
<br />

<br />
I have a friend from France who is also Jewish and he says the community there is very close and exclusive.  France doesn't have a good record when it comes to condoning religions other than Christianity.  They are currently debating a ban on religious clothing in schools: yarmulkes, head scarves and "large" crucifixes.  So Catholics can wear small crosses, but Jews and Muslims cannot wear their specific items.  That law sounds fair, right? My friend says he feels safer walking about the U.S. with his yarmulke on, whereas he doesn't in France.  Maybe the Jews *should* be more vocal in Europe, so they aren't marginalized.  (This story made U.S. news)

I'm sure most of us watch the news every day and listen to the radio.  The same news is regurgitated throughout the day.  Are you telling me that there is no time for foreign news?  Even a more indepth national news.  Some girl got kidnapped and Scott Peterson killed his wife, that's not real news, that's filler.

U.S. news works off of sensationalism (and other countries too).  A crumbling political coalition in Austria or a downturn in the economy of Belize isn't going to make the headlines.  A husband murdering his wife is sensational and will attract viewers.

Maybe they are just enjoying their new freedom of speech?  Thats something they have not had... Ever.  Freedom require responsibility.  When you live as a nation without freedom of spech, or representational government, when you live in fear of your government that correlation is not exercised.  I do not expect the Iraqi people to know the ramification of their actionns yet because they have not had to live with the liberty and therefore responsibility that free speech brings.
<br />

<br />
I do not think that the people of Iraq are dolts nor do I think that they are incapable of determining their own fate.  What I am saying is that they lack practical experience with democracy and personal freedom.  Just like a sailor on a small craft for the first time out to sea they are violently disturbed by the sudden shift of lifestyle and new sensations they have never before experienced. We are likely to see a LOT of wild swinging movement as they get their metaphorical sea legs and we should be prepared to see a few sessions of projectile vomiting as well.
<br />

<br />
In the end, as long as the industrialized nations of the world support Iraq coming of age, everything will turn out well.  Knee jerk reactions to every little stumble they go through will do nothing but establish unhealthy patterns for them to build on and they will never learn to roll with the swells.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Fine, the Denver NRA meeting was "planned years in advance" (I doubt anything is planned years in advance, save for perfect weddings and investments, but I digress), I don't think it would have been too much to ask that the NRA respectfully cancel its event.  The author of the website goes over this event several times; I suppose he's trying to make the page longer, hoping that people will be sick of reading after 3 paragraphs, and they'll assume the 1/4 down scroll bar on their browser hides a lot more material than is actually presented before smacking the X.
<br />

<br />
Are the basic claims in question, such as Canada's homicide metrics as opposed to ours?  Do people in Canada actually leave their doors unlocked (addresses please)?  Really, to invalidate the entire flick for a few instances of sensationalism seems a little premature and arrogant.

I have lived in Canada for years.  As such I've never really known racism or sexism.

Americans are racist and hide behind euphamisms.

My point about the news is that we all interpret it differently depending on our backgrounds.  I don't think that was backpeddling.  It wasn't even up for debate quite honestly.

I'd submit that the world looks differently to almost every nation.  Americans think they're number 1 in the world and perhaps Somalians think they're number 1 (no one has mud huts as big as ours).  I know England think they're hot @#%$ and so do Canadians.<span class="gensmall"></span>

I heard:

No jew died in the 9/11 attack because they were told to not go to work that day.
<br />
Jews are responsible for why people cannot get jobs.
<br />
If you're not jewish you cannot work in the film industry.
<br />

<br />
The biggest problem is that people actually believe that to be true.  They're not just saying it, they actually believe it.  Some people believe 9/11 was orchestrated by the CIA.  There's so many of these terrible connections that people can make that have no basis in reallity.
<br />

<br />
I think most comments based on fact or experience are pretty reasonable.  I don't believe too many conspiracy theories.  I do believe a lot of things are withheld from public knowledge just to protect people from having to know certain truths.  I know for myself I've seen a lot of things that I wish I'd never seen and I don't think I'm better off for knowing them.<span class="gensmall"></span>

<br />
And that comes from a french jew ( or ex jew for that matters ).
<br />
And about the comments of the pro laic law in school in France , it might be a good thing to check ur facts , place them in a global context before you have any judgement.
<br />
There is something here that could be translated into "split of the church and the state".It is totally different from the US system and their "in god we trust" written on $ bills.
<br />
Both of these attitudes toward religion were developped by ppl over the last generations and , in a way , define the relation a citizen has with the state.It is part of what we call the "democratic cement" ( sorry for the approximative translation ).
<br />
If you prefer , its how we both built our democracy.
<br />
We ( the french ) split from the church ( catholic at the time ) and built our republic on laic valors.Religion is a personnal matter that should involve just you.You are free to practice it the way you feel if as long as you dont interfere with other ppl's liberty.
<br />
From what i understood , US has a lot more "direct" relation with religion.
<br />
Any of your president's speech is ended with a religious blessing , its written on ur money , etc etc...
<br />
It seems to me that both of these aspects work well for either of the parties involved , I am "shocked" when i see your president talk about an "axis of evil" , considering i think this has no place in the mouth of a politic leader.
<br />
You , on the other hand , seem to find this perfectly normal.
<br />
I don't think that our way is the best , just that we made it the way we did for a reason , because its more in line with our notion of the relation that a citizen should have with spiritual matters ( u might want to check how Rome dealt with those matters , its kinda interesting ).
<br />
In a more simple way , the way we have now in France ( as in some countries in Europe ) is what it is because it looks like us.
<br />
Your way probably looks like you ( on a very global level ) , and therefore is more appropriate to deal with your domestic problems.
<br />
However , our 2 cultures are so different that it would be foolish of us to judge your society.
<br />
To me , most american things seem horribly american , I see the impact of your culture on almost all of it.
<br />
It probably is the same with you.
<br />
You seem shocked by the law anti religious signs in public schools , then think how shocked we are toward your position to fire arms.
<br />
Our ways are just not the same.
<br />
I won't come and preach french ways here because they couldn't work in ur country and u'd find them absurd ( and i can totally understand that ).
<br />
I try not to judge your way of life , even if lots of its aspect seems horrible to me , because I know we don't speak the same language on those matters.
<br />
Try to do the same , and maybe one day you can get beyond the level of average bickering that reigns here and in most places where american talk with europeans.
<br />
Oh and one last thing , I tasted ur coffee , it s @#%$ ;p<span class="gensmall"></span>

Definitely.  BSE is spread by contamniated feed, not cow-to-cow contact, like hoof and mouth disease (England seems to have all sorts of livestock issues lately...) The fact that the cow originated in Canada shows that the problem is in...Canada.  Not to say that the American beef industry is entirely safe (lucky is a better term), as far as BSE.  Feeding cows reprocessed cow parts (cannibalism) just isnt a smart move.
<br />

<br />
I dont agree with you, Drainer.  I, too, have lived and visited many foreign lands.  My perspective is that the US media is not censored.  Biased? You bet! Why any communication is just that.  Reporting the good things that are going on in Iraq rather than dwelling on the bad that you mentioned (all a product of the former government) is indicative of a choice of using your limited air time on something extraordinary; we all know about the nasty things.  Death and distruction in Iraq isnt new...how did you put it...?...it is...filler.  
<br />

<br />
As for hearing about Jews every day...I suppose if you are listening for a particular topic or word, you are bound to hear it.  The last time I checked, Jews were part of the demographic of the US.  As are Arabs, Swahili., etc.

I would like to see your source on British battle casualties.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Perhaps you should step out of your bubble buddy.  Just because a problem starts in one place yet migrates somewhere else, doesn't negate the fact that you still got a problem.   American's are just looking for a scapegoat when it comes to the whole BSE issue.  Also given the fact that Canada/US are such massive trade partners, this issue cannot solely be the problem for 1 of us.  It is a <span style="font-weight: bold">North American</span> problem.

				<td colspan="2"><div class="postbody">Ok, for those of you that may not have read at all, only partial, or skimmed through the rest of this thread, here is the deal. 
<br />
Drainer originally, on another thread in this section, talked about how the US media was censored, such as Brit media has anti slander laws against them, so they cant report on anything or say anything they want to.
<br />
Later, Drainer flipped it to say that the US media purposely edited its own news stories to censor the public.
<br />
This may help to clear up which side of what side you are trying to argue.
<br />
As for the Mad cow scare in Wa state, it is a Canadian problem as far as origin. It is a US  problem as far as current location. 
<br />
To say the US has been lucky is a stretch. US and Canada have had rules against feed for several years. They took the precautions to make sure this didnt happen. The luck ran out when a cow born and fed before the cow feed laws, ate bad food.
<br />
It is a very good thing that there is a tracking system in place, and actually followed. The cows origin was tracked fast, the cows young was tracked fast, any other potentially contaminated meat from cows from the same farm was tracked and destroyed.
<br />
It would be nice to say Canada has the problem, which they really do. But as far as teh world is concerned, that cow was in the US when it became sick, so it is a US problem? US looking for canadian scapegoat? No. Trying to shift the eye of the public a bit? Yes. Any other country with that chance and that much money on the line would have done the same.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Im, you need to understand how BSE is spread.  I explained that in my post.  BSE is not a North American problem, its a world wide problem....it started about 15 years ago in Greece with scrapies.....migrated to Britain when they ground up the contaminated carcasses and fed them to British beef.  Contaminated beef by-products were made and sent around the world.  Voila!  Here we are!  Sorry to burst your bubble.

I think there is a difference between saying:  "we had a single cow with Mad cow disease and it's been contained" and "we had a single cow with mad cow disease and it's been contained, the cow came from Canada".  Is the implication that all cows from Canada have mad cow disease or that America has to fear cows from Canada or that Americans would never have mad cow disease?  If America imports beef, or cattle from other countries then there is a concern about tainted beef.  Having one cow with the disease got into the country, how many cows were slaughtered and then brought in untested?  COOK YOUR BEEF WELL!<span class="gensmall"></span>

Cooking beef will not stop the contagen that causes mad cow disease.  It is a simple protein that is bent the wrong way and is not destroyed by heat nor pressure.
<br />

<br />
The reason the origin of the cow in question is important is because the vector of transmission for mad cow disease needed to be determined and other infected cattle found.  The media making a lot of noise about it, again for your elucidation, is MEDIA HYPE.  Noone cares what the media says.  Here in the states you are expected to filter out the unrational and spun bits.  The news is your responsibility to understand not anyone elses to present.
<br />

<br />
You dont see signs here in teh US that say "No Canadian meat" or anything like that.  No one is boycotting Canada.  No one cares, most understand the scale of the threat for what it is infintessimily small. I'm avoiding all central nervous system tissue from cows period.  No more cabeza tacos or oxtail soup for me.  It just seems smart, but has no bearing on Canada or anywhere else.
<br />

<br />
I think that this veiwpoint is very common here in the states.<span class="gensmall"></span>

They found the cow, the herd it came from, the young it bore, the young that the rest of the herd bore, the meat that came from cattle in that herd and destroyed it all. It is safe.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Bias is a news organization determining for itself the perspective it will take on an issue.

Censorship is a third party telling a news organization what it can and cannot say.

They are not even remotely the same thing.<span class="gensmall"></span>

				<td colspan="2"><div class="postbody">You are correct, Poppa, in that you cant cook the prion out of the meat.  But cooking and proper food handling will minimize the real dangers of beef-bactierial infection, such as E coli and clostridium.  Those are nasties that are easily contracted and virulent.
<br />

<br />
The good new about BSE is that it cant be easily contracted.  Dont eat nervous tissue and you will just about eliminate any chance of getting it.  So go easy on the "sweetbreads" and dont go on that tv show that features people eating cow eyes.  Know whats ground up in your hamburger and eat them only well-done.  Rare steaks are ok, though.
<br />

<br />
Other good new is that BSE has never been detected on a bovine of less than 30 months of age, even when force-fed infected material.  Given that the average age of a beefer is 18 months at slaughter and regulations prohibiting the use of infective material (brains, spinal cord, eyes), the chances of getting BSE is incredibly small.

<br />
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Italian scientists have found a second form of mad cow disease that more closely resembles the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease than the usual cow form of the illness. 
<br />

<br />
The brain-wasting diseases BSE, known as mad cow disease, and human CJD are caused by different forms of mutant proteins called prions. A number of people, mainly in England, have also suffered from what is called variant CJD, a brain disease believed to be acquired by eating meat from infected cows. No Americans have been reported with variant CJD. 
<br />

<br />
Now, the team of Italian researchers reports a study of eight cows with mad cow disease found that two of them had brain damage resembling the human victims of CJD. They said the cows were infected with prions that resembled those involved in the standard form of the human disease, called sporadic CJD, not the variant caused by eating infected meat. 
<br />

<br />
Salvatore Monaco, lead author of the new study, said the findings may indicate that cattle can also develop a sporadic form of the disease, but it might also be a new foodborne form of the illness. 
<br />

<br />
Dr. Paul Brown of the National Institutes of Health said the finding does not indicate an increased threat to humans. 
<br />

<br />
If a new form of the disease were affecting humans there should be an increase in the incidence of CJD, said Brown, who was not part of the research team. 
<br />

<br />
However, scientists in Europe have studied all cases of sporadic CJD for the last decade and the incidence has not changed, said Brown, an expert in the disease, who works at the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke. 
<br />

<br />
Both the human and cattle diseases cause holes to form in the brain. The Italian researchers found that, in addition to the holes, two cows had an accumulation of amyloid plaque in their brains. Amyloid plaques are an indication of Alzheimer's disease in humans. They have also been found in people with sporadic CJD but had not been found in cattle, the researchers said. 
<br />

<br />
Mad cow disease is formally known as BSE -- bovine spongiform encephalophy -- and the Italians named the new form with amyloid plaques BASE. 
<br />

<br />
"Although observed in only two cattle, the BASE phenotype could be more common than expected," they reported. 
<br />

<br />
Monaco said in an interview via e-mail that he believes the incidence could be as high as 5 percent among cattle with mad cow symptoms. 
<br />

<br />
But while human CJD and BASE share several characteristics, the Italian researchers cautioned against assuming a link between the two. 
<br />

<br />
The findings of the team led by Monaco, of the Department of Neurological and Visual Science, Policlinico G.B. Rossi, in Verona, Italy, are reported in this week's online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. 
<br />

<br />
Brown said there have also been some unpublished reports from Japan of cows with a different form of mad cow disease. 
<br />

<br />
Cattle are believed to develop BSE from eating infected tissues of other animals. Such feed has now been banned in many countries, including the United States. 
<br />

<br />
The first case of mad cow disease in the United States was reported in December in Washington state, involving a cow imported from Canada. 
<br />

<br />
An investigation seeking other cattle from the same herd ended last week with Agriculture officials saying they had located all but 11 suspect animals and concluding the rest could not be found.<span class="gensmall"></span>
