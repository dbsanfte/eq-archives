I am begining to become more pro-marijuana as I get older.  If it becomes legal, then that is cool.  If it doesn't, then that's cool.

I do think that there should be a cursory background check and require a license for conceal and carry.  Even down here in pro-gun Texas people accept the requirement to go to classes before they are allowed to concel and carry.  We also should not allow the sale of straight up military type weapons.  I am not talking about M-16 type guns, but like machine guns, .50 caliber guns, and things of that nature.

<br />
The government is part of the economy.  Always has and always will.  The moment the government decides to collect taxes or purchase items (such as military items which is basically outlined in the Constitution therefore within their rights) there will be an impact.  I think the US government has proven that they can have a reasonable intervention and still allow a free market.  Proof being that we have arguably the best market in the world.

<br />
I don't enjoy paying taxes.  I don't enjoy going to the dentist either.  However those things need to be done.  The federal government has a Constitutional responsibility to see to the protection of the country, as well as other duties.  They are, therefore, required to get funding to carry out those duties.

While a balanced budget sounds good, it is not always possible.  Some years you are going to have to run a defecit, and some years you will be in the black.  Marketplace and world economic factors don't follow a fiscal year; things happen over the course of several years so it is silly to expect our government to respond by forcing our budget into an 'unnatural' budget.  Let it reflect the economy.

<br />
In no way do I want to encourage more subsidies, however to a certain degree in some industries there are a real need of subsidies.  For instance take a look at the human genome project.  Much of it was subsidized by the NIH and other gvt agencies.  NASA was a nice little government subsidies.  I am convinced that we learned way more due to this 'crazy' subsidy than anything we lost.  I would rather see our tax money used to subsidize certain things in various industries instead of seeing other countries subsidize those very same industries in their country.  In some instances, such as the human genome project, the scientific knowledge of our country would fall far behind that of other countries.  Many of you people argue for fuel cell powered vehicles, and if that is ever going to work it will require government subsidies.

Being that I used to work in the environmental testing field, I will atest to the fact that the government standards are not arbitrary.  The LP then obviously does not understand this issue.  If they do not understand this issue, then how can they develop a policy concerning this?
<br />
I think we need a government agency to act as a third party.  Else we will get a bunch of he said/she said stuff going on as companies or citizens accuse each other of pollution.

I am all for encouraging private schools, but I think it is crazy to totally eliminate government involvement in education.  Universities, by the way, are another thing I think that should be subsidized by the federal government.  As cliche as it sounds, eductation is indeed a major determining factor in the success of a society.  I therefore feel that providing education to the citizens is one of the best things government can do.

Therefore it is implied in the US Constitution, the almighty document in this country, that the federal governemnt is to negotiate with foreign countries.  If such treaties require us to intervene, then so be it.  If we need to intervene for our own protection then so be it.
<br />
For a party that claims to want to return to the essence of the Constitution, they sure do seem to ignore many specific points in the Constiution.

I think the UN as it is now sucks.  That being said we can not live under a rock, there are more countries than the good ole USA.  We must deal with other countries.

Man, the LP is just getting stupid.  They read the first part of Section 2 in the US Constitution but managed to fail to read the parts that specifically states that the President can make treaties, appoint officeholders, sign bills, and so forth.  I mentioned it earlier and I mention it again now; the LP seems to be very selective of what items in the Constitution they wish to follow.

Again, we are not alone in the world.  I do not think we should casually just fork over money left and right, but the fact that we are a charitable nation is part of our societal fabric.  I got the feeling that the LP wants to get rid of all international contacts and be literal shut-ins.  That is not a country I wish to live in.

No exceptions, eh?   There is a good way to get the vote of military veterens.  Again, there are more things in the world than just our country.  Sending econimic aid to rebuilding nations is a good thing; just ask Japan and Germany.  This is just another example of the LP not thinking things through.
<br />
Haha, no exceptions . . .
<br />

<br />

<br />
I used to think I supported many of the Libertarian Party messages, but after really reading more about what they stand for I really do think they are a nutty fringe group.  Many of their platform stances "sound good" however the problem is that they really have not seemed to have thought things through.  I think the LP appeals to many of you people because they do attempt to be up front about their stances, but the problem with that is politics change, society changes, the world changes.<br />

				There's a reason for that, Xianin.  Mainly it's because the Libertarian party's origins and many of their stances can be traced directly back to the anarchist movements in Europe.  When anarchist activity was banned there, the groups splintered and reformed calling themselves Libertarians to avoid official notice.
<br />

<br />
What we have in the United States is largely based off of the platforms that those groups operated under.  For anyone who chooses to argue with the above statements, I strongly suggest you do some research before posting, otherwise I will happily make you look stupid.

				You claim these are the extreme Libertarian Party stances?  I don't think they are, chiefly so because they ares right up there on their official webpage.  You compare them to the extremists in the Republican and Democrat party, however neither of those parties specifically mention stances taken by the extremists in their party.  Both Republicans and Democrats do seem to state more moderate views pubically.
<br />

I don't think those are extreme views by a select few in the LP, but rather the 'average' view of the LP.

European libertarianism is anarcho-communist ala Marx.
<br />

<br />
American Libertarians are Classic Liberals ala Jefferson.
<br />

<br />
They have nothing to do with each other.
<br />

<br />
Xianin,
<br />

<br />
Libertarian principles are hard fast.  One thing ou can say about Libertarians is that you can count on their foundations holding strong.  They do not waver in their philosophy for expedience though they are quite pragmatic.  Libertarians do not pretend that they are the only political party or philsophy.
<br />

<br />
I was tempted to quote you and reply to each of your points but there are too many and you are nitpicking with some.  I can address your criticism in general though by forwarding a missing concept in your approach.  Those platform positions do not at all include alternative remedies.  You argue philsophy against practicality, but you do not quote any libertarian pragmatism.
<br />

<br />
Its not fair to point at a principle and say it is not practical.  By definition you are correct.  It may be more constructive to challenge not the principle but ask how would a libertarian address these problems differently?  Then discuss the practicality of alternate solutions.
<br />

<br />
There is always more than one way to skin a cat, Libertarians promote seeking new solutions to old problems that are as liberty minded as possible.  The principles are a useful guide to where lines are better drawn when considering new solutions.
<br />

<br />
I'd love to argue some of your points, but please pick one or two at a time... just to keep it practical... of course. <img src="images/smiles/smile.gif" alt="smile" border="0" /><br />

				Whats wrong with a .50 cal BMG bolt action rifle? How is an M-16 type gun less dangerous? You can't just go to a gun shop and buy a military type weapon without a permit, a clean criminal background and proof of citizenship. To buy an AR-15 (your M-16 type gun that is ok to buy, also considered an assault rifle) you need to have a background check and pass, and you need to prove you are a citizen of the U.S. To buy a military type weapon (machine guns etc) you need to have a permit and license from the BATF, pay a $200 tax and if the ATF wants, they can come to your home and invade your privacy and check to see what types of guns you have. Did you know its legal to buy and own a silencer?? All you need to do is fill out some paperwork with the ATF, get a CLEO to signoff for you, pay a $200 tax and wait a few months for the ATF to approve your application to own a silencer. Same for machine guns. People just seem to think that you can just go to a gun shop, throw money on the table and buy whatever you want. It doesn't work that way.<br />

<br />
No, sorry.
<br />

<br />
While modern libertarianism has quite a bit in common with classical liberalism, modern libertarianism takes many of its stances much, much farther than the people you're referring to back in the 1700s did.  They take them to a point that they have more in common with anarchists than with classic liberals.  Hence why libertarians are pretty much divided between minarchists and anarcho-capitalists, with minarchists being the more moderate, and anarcho-capitalists being the more radical.
<br />

<br />
The entire problem with the libertarian party is that while some of you are, you know, rational, and understand that limiting the government too far would be disastrous, there are far more of you that can't look at long-term effects at all.  The ideas that you propose would generate mass chaos and a decline of the country in general, due to the simple fact that you're ignorant of how a country is run.

				I think you'll find that a number of these views are intentionally listed in the most extreme way possible so that people know, up front, what the party stands for. Everything and every view in the libertarian party stems from one simple principle, and that is that you own your body. If you find yourself in disagreement with a stance, it is a good idea if you think it through and wonder, "How does this view on this issue arise from the idea that every man is his own master?"
<br />

<br />
It is fine to list the party stances, but also unfair to list them without the proposed solutions and suggestions the LP has for alternatives to the current systems that they disagree with. Also, keep in mind reasons like, "It's never been done before" or "That's not the way things work in this country" are not justifications for continuing to use @#%$ system. No excuses.
<br />

<br />
You'll also find that a lot of the LP's current members do not see eye to eye with LP policy on several issues, despite agreeing in principle. Most libertarians are there because they are sick of misrepresentation from the big two, and the LP is the most sane of the alternatives, and the one most likely to stick to their guns and represent individual rights and liberty at the expense of all other factors. That's the party's main draw, especially on young people.

Like it or not, that is what personal responsibility means. If your actions harm another person, only then is there any crime and any reason for punishment. You'll find that most of the financial crimes you listed do in fact hurt someone, somewhere. Welfare abuse injures those paying for the welfare, piracy injures those provably deprived of profit, tax evasion hurts the government. 
<br />

<br />
Don't think of DWI as a crime... think of it as a revokation of your right to drive because you violated the contract you agreed to abide by when you obtained your driver's license. Driving is not a right; it's a priviledge. You must apply for a license, and meet set criteria to obtain it. The state can revoke your ability to do so based on any criteria it can pass in its legislature. One of those criteria currently in force is that you refrain from driving while under the influence of substances that impair your judgement and reaction time. Most people do not find this unreasonable, including most libertarians.
<br />

<br />
Plenty of people still drink and drive; don't pretend the law makes the problem go away. Friends preventing friends from doing it <span style="font-style: italic">because it is a bad idea</span> has done far more to prevent drunk driving than preventing people from doing it just because it is against the law. The law really does nothing more than revoking the license so the offender cannot drive again for a long time, and it screws him on his insurance and liability (a natural consequence of his irresponsible use of his priviledge). He chose to drive drunk, therefore he accepts responsibility for what happens.
<br />

<br />
You'll find libertarians object to police checkpoints (as a form of unreasonable search) investigating all cars on a given highway far more than they do to drunk driving laws. Be careful not to confuse the issue. I doubt any libertarian would have a problem with a police officer pulling over a car swerving all over the road and finding the driver drunk; I certainly wouldn't.

Nobody is refraining from doing drugs because they are illegal. If people want to try them, no law is going to get in their way. We may as well remove the laws and bring that black market back into the regular world economy, so that criminals are deprived of one of their chief sources of income. It is a "war" that cannot be won at any price, so it is pointless to fight it. 
<br />

<br />
All historical data from prohibition and drug use prior to its illegalization, as well as numbers on drug use in countries where it is legal, points clearly and irrefutably at the fact that drugs are more of a problem now that they are illegal than they ever were when nobody cared about them except the people using them. We've had this discussion here in another thread somewhere, links to numbers are there.
<br />

<br />
Marijuana will be the first one across the legal line, and I think that's going to happen within a decade. If libertarians somehow ended up with majority power in government I doubt very much even they would legalize all drugs overnight. Once marijuana is legalized, we can study the effect and learn what to expect, and how best to handle things like medical insurance under that paradigm. There will still be plenty of penalties for it, make no mistake... they just won't be imposed by government. Your employer can still fire you for it if they choose. Try showing up to work drunk sometime if you don't believe that.

Involuntary treatment might be acceptable in certain extreme situations, as you say. No law can cover all possible situations, so this is always the case with any topic.

We hardly have reasonable intervention. It is not the job of the government to bail out failing corporations. If they fail, that is simply the way the market works. I think you're overstating the libertarian view a bit here... their take is to go as hands-off as possible. The current government is hands-on in many ways that they simply do not need to be.
<br />

<br />
Libertarians also oppose anti-trust laws. I'm not sure I like that particular stance. Fundamentally it is correct... if a monopoly exists unjustly, a free market force will appear to correct it (witness linux vs Microsoft). Thing is, with a little push from the government, they can keep the curve closer to the center and not let it swing so strongly in one direction for so long. It's good harm prevention. It might take the free market 20 years to come up with a response, and that's 20 years of abusive monopoly. Not good.

The only tax I am willing to support, ever, is some kind of single nationwide flat tax. Everyone pays the same percentage, and there are no rules, loopholes, tax breaks, or any of @#%$. You pay x percent and that's it. The full body of such a tax law should fit on a single index card... more than that and it's unnecessarily complex.

You should also keep in mind that a libertarian government would lack something like 80% of the current government's size and complexity. No social security, no corporate bailouts, no public education, no war on drugs, no special funding for business interests... all of these things handed out to private companies, as it should be. The government in that situation requires a lot less money to run, and it becomes far easier for them to pay down the debt and keep their books in the black.

I would rather see our tax money used to subsidize certain things in various industries instead of seeing other countries subsidize those very same industries in their country.

The government itself has no business giving subsidies. Let those in need of money turn to banks and other private entities to get it. That is the way a free market works.

Both ways work. Only one of them is permissible under our government's charter. I'd rather stick to the plan. If other countries outcompete us in medical technology (as India is doing now, for example), that's hardly the government's fault, nor is it their job to get us back on track.

I agree that there are, simply put, precious few things important than education to any successful society. This argument in favor of government education, however, has never made any sense to me whatsoever. Here's why.
<br />

<br />
The USA has the best universities in the entire world, and the largest number of them. People travel from all over the entire world to come here and study, because it is the best place to learn, and it is widely accepted everywhere in the world that this is the case. All responsibility, financial and otherwise, is placed directly on the student. This education system is private and run by businesses and individuals.
<br />

<br />
The USA has one of the worst public education systems in the 'first world', consistently placing us well behind the education systems of other countries at or near our level of development. We consistently turn out students who are unable to meet even the government's admittedly very low standards of competency. All responsibility is placed soley on the shoulders of the government. This education system is public and run by government.
<br />

<br />
There is only one major difference between these systems: private vs public. That's fucking all, ladies and gentlemen. Case closed.
<br />

<br />
I don't know exactly how you would go about changing the public education system into a private one; it's a very tough problem. It does, however, NEED to be done. The sooner we get started on it, the better off we will be.

I hope you aren't implying that democrats or republicans (people, not elected officials) have a better idea than how the country is run than libertarians do. I'd think quite the opposite. Libertarians at least are aware of third party alternatives and the fuckery of the current election system, and that's more than most people.
<br />

<br />
I think if the LP ever did somehow come into power, their stances on a number of things (particularly, their ideas on how to abolish or phase large parts of government into private business) would compromise in a big damn hurry, precisely because they'd be getting a better idea how things work. Our current government certainly does its best to obscure all of that information every chance it gets. I can't imagine the anarcho-capitalist sect becoming the dominant philosophy in the party, ever. Of course, I didn't think the fascist segment of the republican party would be either, but lately that seems to be the trend.<br />

I sincerely doubt you can find more than ten universities in this country that do not receive some level of government funding, Raviel.  Universities are not completely privatized by any means.

Absolutely the case.  For example, I am NOT an open borders kind of person.  I think you take a severe risk of losing your country if you don't control the borders.
<br />

<br />
I also would not favor the elimination of OSHA.  One of the few proper roles of government is protection of rights, even working peoples right to life, lol.
<br />

<br />
And as a relatively new member of the Civil Service, and having experience with it in the past, I can state unequivically that, despite a paper trail veneer of being a merit system, it is a corrupt nest of cronyism, nepotism, and favoritism.

<br />
The universities, with very little exception, do NOT recieve the funding directly.  Individual students receive funding with which to pay education expenses.  This makes all the difference in the world, as an element of competition remains between schools.  To the extent, however, that the government has allowed price fixing, it has basically resulted in artificially inflated price increases for higher education.  It has been, and probably remains, common practice for schools to consult with each other over select students and tailor the packages they offer so that the net cost to the family is close to the same no matter which institution they attend.  That way, decisions are made on educational results rather than price, and price is steadily rising because the acutal customer doesn't end up paying it, the government does.  Clinton's higher education tax credit caused an immediate jump in higher education cost almost exactly equal to the credit, lol.
<br />

<br />
In any case, the principle remains sound.  Private education produces quality results.  Public education is crap.

I've no problem with government providing financial aid to those attempting to better their lives through education. That is a direct investment in the country's future.

We hardly have reasonable intervention. It is not the job of the government to bail out failing corporations. If they fail, that is simply the way the market works.

The government may seem "too big" in some people's eyes, but I really do not think it is all that bad as it is now.  We are hardly a dictatorship or communistic style government.  I think the US government has reasonable intervention for the most part.  Additionally the US government does not go bailling out failling corporations left and right.  Heck I can't even think of the last time (S&amp;L crises ~20 years ago?).  Even after 9/11, the single biggest attack on domestic soil, the US government refused to provide financial assistance to the airlines.

There are plenty of other ways to get funding (tons of it, actually) than taxes. Personally I don't mind paying taxes, however, I do not like the current tax system, because it is corrupt and easily exploitable, and favors some groups over others. The only tax I am willing to support, ever, is some kind of single nationwide flat tax. Everyone pays the same percentage, and there are no rules, loopholes, tax breaks, or any of @#%$. You pay x percent and that's it. The full body of such a tax law should fit on a single index card... more than that and it's unnecessarily complex.

Interesting that you mention there are several methods for the government to collect funds yet the only thing you can cite as evidence is yet another tax.

I think you are massively oversimplifying the tax system by wanting something to fit on an index card.  We have a very complex economy, and as such we need a complex tax system.
<br />
I think the LP mentions things like making a stuipidly simple tax system just for the PR spin, however it is craziness to think you can solve some complex issues with one simple flat percentage rate.

Government budgets do not work like a business budget.  Which is a good thing, actually.  You really don't want a government to save money for 'hard times.'  Who defines a hard time and where do you expect that money to be kept?  Oh, sure the government could put that in a savings account at a bank and that would open a can of worms in regards to favortism or government interferring with the market.  A government must estimate their costs and spend 100% of what they intend to; well that is it in a nutshell.

Who, though, would be there to define what pulltion is?  You must be able to quantitate a value and state that over this level it is unacceptable and under this level is acceptable.  The government agencies are a great third party to set such regulations.  Let us look at something like smog, the liklihood that Joe Six Pack could succesfully sue MegaCorp for polluting his neighborhood is just about nil.  The ability for the federal government to step in and fine the hell out of MegaCorp is very likley.  Many times, contrary to what naysayers state, the federal government does fight the fight for the 'little guy.'

The USA has one of the worst public education systems in the 'first world', consistently placing us well behind the education systems of other countries at or near our level of development.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />
This is one of those many little 'factoids' that has made it into society, but it is not quite true.  The US does rank below many of our peers, but there is a good reason.  When the US tests public students, all students are tested regardless if they are in special ed remedial class or advanced placement honors classes.  In most other countries, only the students in the academic tracks are tested, as opposed to students in the "lower" tradeskills class.  So basically what happens is that the US testing data includes those scores from students dumber than a doorknob yet testing data from other countries (e.g. Japan) only includes those students who will attend university.  Hardly a fair comparison.  The US is one of the few countries that all students are given an equal chance.  In so many countries across the world if a kid fucks up on a test when he is 13, he could be screwed for life.

I suppose in the Libertarian world without OSHA my family could sue my employer for my untimely death and win some $$ but frankly I wouldn't care because I would be dead.  OSHA covers anything from requiring employers to provide work boots that meet minimal safety standards to things like making sure the air is breathable in the work place.
<br />
In a way OSHA is like a watchdog for the employees of the nation.  OSHA, arguably, is one of the few branches of government that I am 100% happy with and believe that they function quite well.

This is patently untrue.  Most state universities provide quite good education.  A degree from the University of Tennessee, for instance, is quite well respected.  Same goes for most of the others.
<br />

<br />
As Xianin said, <span style="font-style: italic">every</span> state university's primary source of funding is, in fact, the government, from both state and federal levels.  Even the private universities receive a fair amount of government funding, and not just in terms of grants and loans, which no matter how you cut it are still examples of the government funding a school.  The school is still provided the money from the grant or loan, ya know.  If you think differently, I apologize, but you are incorrect.
<br />

<br />
Xianin, the main difference between Japanese education and ours is fairly fundamental.  An undergraduate degree from one of their public universities is worthless there, yes, because most undergraduate degrees don't deal with specialized fields, which comprise the majority of the Japanese business world.  Worthless in Japan has nothing to do, however, with the quality of their educational system.  I'm not knocking our educational system, I'm just pointing out that the whole "we have the best universities EVAR!" stance is misinformed.
