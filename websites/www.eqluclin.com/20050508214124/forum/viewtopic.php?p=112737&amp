<br />
<a href="http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=76563" target="_blank" class="postlink"> here </a> . It is the state of Everquest from a perspective of someone who took a break for a short while. Very well written. 
<br />

<br />
The reason I posted it in this forum however, is because it is well written and offers a variety of debate material! (this forum doesn't have to be exclusively non-Game related does it?)
<br />

<br />
In anycase, many of the topics below can be applied accross many different games! A good read.
<br />

<br />
Oh and Gemdiver wrote a good article <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=8587" target="_blank" class="postlink"> Here </a>. Again more good debate material. 
<br />

<br />
Read em both and post below.
<br />

<br />
(thanks to Loral of Mobhunter for bringing these to my attention.)
<br />

<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote"> So I found myself playing another MMO a few weeks ago. I had a good time with it. It's not EQ, and doesn't have the depth or grandeur of EQ, but it was a welcome break. I've also been spreading out and playing some other games on various platforms, including consoles.
<br />

<br />
Last night, I logged back into EQ to check with my friends and see how everything was going. What I found was that EQ seemed almost painfully slow and un-fun compared to all the other stuff I'd been doing. 
<br />

<br />
What this tells me is not that I will be quitting EQ forever yadda deleting all my characters yadda no you can't have my stuff yadda yadda. This DOES tell me that my break isn't quite over for the time being. I have no doubt that EQ will continue to be my MMO of choice. For the time being, however, I'm having more fun exploring other venues. I need to give EQ a little time to become strange, exciting, and challenging again.
<br />

<br />
That said, my brief stint away has given me some time to crystalize some thoughts on EQ that people who are currently closer to the game may be too polarized to think about objectively. Hopefully, my thoughts may give others ideas on what they want to ask for when the 're-envisioning' hand comes around to adjust their particular slice of the game world.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- EQ's consider system is not being used for its intended purpose. 
<br />

<br />
Everquest's con system, the familiar green, light blue, blue, yellow, and red is not being used to indicate relative difficulty of monsters. It's being used almost solely as an indicator of experience modifier from the very lowest levels to the very highest levels.
<br />

<br />
This indicates that enemies have levels that are wildly inconsistent with their @#%$ points, and damage capacity. As EQ has grown as a game, this disparity between 'con' and actual difficulty has grown more apparent. You can even try to peg part of this disparity on trying to adjust the con system for group mechanics, but even then, the disparity is still more indicative of the experience you can expect to receive than the difficulty of the fight.
<br />

<br />
Depending on where you are in the game and the makeup of your group, a single 'blue' con mob may be a brisk, refreshing fight or an almost impossible pitched battle.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- The 'Death Penalty' in EQ is extremely harsh.
<br />

<br />
The experience loss penalty in EQ is really quite severe compared to just about every other game on the market. 'Ressurections' are nominally intended as a mechanic to encourage players to form groups, but even then are still quite severe. Players without ressurection abilities on taps are hurt the worst, in terms of hours of 'lost' experience. Even with ressurection abilities available, the amount of downtime and 'lost' time incurred due to player death is quite punitive when compared to other games. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- Reinforcement is very punitive in EQ.
<br />

<br />
Everquest's bread and butter is reinforcing game play. 
<br />

<br />
Players are rewarded, usually with smaller stimuli such as the increase of a statistic or status bar. Occasionally, they are rewarded for completing a story-line quest with character dialogue. The most major rewards in EQ are new items, new abilities, and the ability to travel to new areas, which occur must less frequently.
<br />

<br />
Players are also punished quite sternly, both with the 'time loss' death penalty mentioned above, but also with down-time, in which one or more players are 'resting' due to over exertion of one kind or another, or loss of items or money earned. 
<br />

<br />
The best reward to punishment ratio comes from following well-established curves, pre-existing steps, and favorable conditions.
<br />

<br />
It does not pay, for example, to explore a dangerous new area, because there is significantly more punishment than reward involved when compared to playing a repetitive 'grinding' game in a well-explored older area. Attempting an encounter, a quest, or recipe without having read a walkthrough beforehand is an almost certain recipe for disaster.
<br />

<br />
Punishment comes fast and furiously compared to many other games, while rewards are often so slow and tedious to be nonexistent.
<br />

<br />
Punishment also comes from outside the game world to strike in a more personal matter. Innovation often means breaking established rules. Innovation in a game world, where rules are enforced, often draws the attention of the owners of said game world. 'Nerf' is the single most dreaded word in MMOG players vocabulary. 'Banned' seems equivalent to a death penalty.
<br />

<br />
To put it in perspective, lets revisit my (in)famous jolly rancher lab monkeys. 
<br />

<br />
The inquisitive monkey learns that by pressing the three new levers in his cage in sequential order-- 1, 2, 3,-- he is rewarded with a jolly rancher. 
<br />

<br />
He also learns that by pressing the buttons out of order, he receives a painful shock!
<br />

<br />
Sometimes, however, when pressing the buttons out of order, you avoid the shock. Not always, but just every once in a while, he gets a handful of jolly ranchers. It's a big risk to take, but gives a larger reward than the set order.
<br />

<br />
Monkey see... monkey do. Most monkeys... even the inquisitive monkey, will usually stick with the ordered 1, 2, 3 button pushing. It's steady and slow. They don't get many jolly ranchers, but they do get a steady stream of them and aren't shocked.
<br />

<br />
The 'hard-core' monkey who none of the other monkeys play with any more because he's aggressive, smells bad, and doesn't have any teeth left, does some late-night tinkering with the buttons at the expensive of several painful shocks. He realizes that if he wiggles button 1 just so, and then twists the handle off of button 3, the hopper jams open and instantly dispenses ALL the jolly ranchers.
<br />

<br />
The lab interns, realizing that monkey see, monkey do, beat the hard-core monkey within an inch of his life with rubber tubing in front of all the other monkeys in order to try to keep them from repeating his actions. Then they take him out of the cage and he is never seen again.
<br />

<br />
THEN they fix the broken hopper so that it doesn't dispense jolly ranchers any more.
<br />

<br />
Then they surgically remove several of the inquisitive monkey's fingers, just in case. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- EQ is Deep, but not Broad
<br />

<br />
It's been said before that players leave EQ for the graphics of another game and then come back for the content. I think that is very true. Compared to other games, Everquest has a wealth of content that is difficult, if not downright impossible, to compete against. It's got six years and nine plus expansions worth of zones, monsters, quests, recipes, and whatnot. There are literally hundreds of raid events in the game now.
<br />

<br />
That said, all of EQ's massive amount of content is tied to the same stake. There are only a very few ways to enjoy EQ. Even if you question players, there less than a handful of ways you can 'properly' play EQ. Accordingly, a great deal of EQ's content goes unused because it lacks open-ness of purpose and mutability of form.
<br />

<br />
In EQ, you fight enemies and accumulate rewards. There are relatively very few rewards for exploration, crafting, or lore research. The rewards that do exist outside of the former are still tied into the main activity. To do well in any activity in EQ, you first have to excel at that first concept, fighting monsters and taking their stuff.
<br />

<br />
This encourages some abuses. To be able to be a master craftsman, for example, one must first be willing to travel to the reaches of the game world over real-life weeks and months and engage in deadly combat there. Since people instinctively seek shortcuts, power-levelling and e-baying become seen as viable alternatives to real game-play.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- EQ offers rewards based on content age rather than difficulty or resource usage.
<br />

<br />
The areas in EQ that reward players with the most experience and best items are not necessarily the most difficult. They are, however, almost universally, the newest content... or the content that developers, designers, and marketing staff want players to experience. 
<br />

<br />
The latest zones usually have the latest and greatest in terms of experience rewards and item rewards. This causes the EQ population to gradually shift towards newer content released in expansions while older content is neglected. This means that the bulk of the population in the huge in-game world is focused on very specific areas while the rest of the world seems empty by comparison.
<br />

<br />
Content neglected is resources that go unused, so not only is this something that affects EQ players, it also effects SOE's bottom line. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- EQ concentrates on 'high end' content at the expense of replay value.
<br />

<br />
The overwhelming theme in Everquest is that players who spend the most time adventuring in the game world achieve the best rewards. This seems intuitive and simple. Most MMOG players would agree and endorse this notion.
<br />

<br />
In Everquest, however, exploration is also considered a reward. Accordingly, one of the rewards for levelling to 46 is the ability to explore higher level zones. There are many rationalizations for this mechanism, including important concepts like preventing grief play and discouraging power-levelling. The over-riding reality is that access to new areas is often doled out just like new abilities or items. It's a reward rather than a game mechanism.
<br />

<br />
There is very little content in the game that works the other way around. There are a total of two raid encounters in the entire game that are level restricted for younger players in any way. There is only one zone... the tutorial zone... that you cannot enter if you are over a certain level.
<br />

<br />
A great deal of this is driven by the player base itself rather than the designers or developers. Players adhere to the 'time == rewards' mechanism if anything, more firmly than the game developers. The most vocal players are more likely to adhere to it more than less vocal players. Accordingly, the game developers are made to understand that there is more demand for high level content than low- or mid-level content. They meet the demand with new content and reinforce this concept in a cyclical manner.
<br />

<br />
Again, this encourages some abuses, such as power-levelling and ebaying since there is very little reason to 'remain young' or replay the game with lower level characters for the sake of experiencing content.
<br />

<br />
It also actively discourages new players from starting EQ since the investments to see substantial rewards are very well known and broadly advertised.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- EQ is a very old game
<br />

<br />
Six years is unheard of in the world of game design. Think of other games that are six years old. Most PC games released in 1999 were not 3d games, let alone multiplayer games. The only other 'massive' online game, Ultima Online, was 2D. The double handful of 3D games that did exist were only starting to rely on 3D graphics rendering technology.
<br />

<br />
Being so old, EQ has a lot of built-up crud, including old, difficult to maintain software, old, difficult to maintain hardware, and an old, difficult to please user base. Everquest is incredibly 'crufty' as it were. 
<br />

<br />
This has some bonuses and some negatives. The Everquest client is a surprisingly mature and robust piece of software with a modular architecture. It contains a wealth of features and relatively little bloat. Better than 99% of the EQ game client's disk-space requirements are used by data files-- the graphics, sounds, and models that make up the game world.
<br />

<br />
The older client software gets, however, the more difficult it is to maintain in the face of changing technology. EQ's major graphics engine has had to have major overhauls not once, but twice during its history, each overhaul bringing a tribulation of grief and suffering along for the ride. EQ does not perform nearly as well as it could be expected to, simply because there is so much legacy code still in place.
<br />

<br />
New games are often designed to target the cutting edge of PC technology in terms of requirements. EQ has always targeted this edge. This means that a 6 year old game often still runs with some painful caveats... such as amazingly poor performance when a 'busy' area is displayed. 
<br />

<br />
"Lag" used to refer to data loss due to poor network transmission. Now, to the majority of EQ players, it means a poor graphical frame-rate.
<br />

<br />
This is not just a problem on the client side. EQ's game rules have changed dramatically over the years. Rather than a new set of rules for a new era, EQ players are still subject to modifications of rules that were crafted in 1999. Each sweeping rule change in response to a new technology or market demand has the potential to make EQ unplayable. Many redundant rule-sets and game mechanisms exist, often causing player confusion or strife. There are even multiple sound, model, and graphics formats used to store the game world, all of which must be maintained as if they were brand new.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- EQ has unprecedented inertia
<br />

<br />
Since EQ is such an old game and its rules are so old, a vocal portion of it's population has strong negative reactions to change that have been reinforced over six years. Any rule change, positive or negative, is met with hysteria and argument.
<br />

<br />
Game developers are in the unenviable position of having to vet their every action before players who may view it differently or violently oppose it. Players may object to attempts to lessen the learning curve associated with the game or view any changes to the difficulty as one part of the game as an attack against them.
<br />

<br />
Let's look at a completely hypothetical situation to understand this argument. Let's say, and this is completely for the sake of discussion and not a statement of suggestion, that SOE decided to make EQ an entirely raid-oriented game. All characters start the game able to raid and most of the game mechanics are altered so that the game's primary mechanic is large, multi-group raids.
<br />

<br />
Most reading can imagine the initial outcry over such a decision.
<br />

<br />
Although many people play EQ for raiding purposes alone, such a move would be violently protested. Even if it were to prove wildly successful, howls of disgust and anguish would rise. Messageboards would be engulfed in flames, brimstone, and sulfur. The sun was as black as satcloth and the moon was as red as blood. Yea verily.
<br />

<br />
Now let's take it the opposite direction. Let's assume that SOE decided t o make EQ an entirely single-group oriented game. All game mechanics are altered so that the game's primary mechanic is play with six or less people. Any attempt to engage a an encounter with more than 6 people is not rewarded.
<br />

<br />
The same apocalypse, trials, and tribulations, and end times would STILL result. There would still be rioting and war in the streets. Lions would still lie with lambs. Dogs and cats, living together. Total chaos.
<br />

<br />
This inertia makes changes to the game EXTREMELY difficult, both for game developers, the management of SOE, and for inertial mass of players as well.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
These statements are not meant to try to provoke instantaneous, sweeping change in the game. They're meant to be a perspective that will help others, hopefully the game developers as well, understand problems with the game and think of ways to alleviate them.
<br />

<br />
My own break from EQ will probably not be too long. Maybe when I come back, some of these problems will have evaporated.

And Vox and Naggy haven't been very routinely raided in 2+ years on Luclin, when people still wanted their Epic 1.0 because it was superior, and loot was still decent from them.
<br />
When it got to the point of players attempting and supposedly soloing Naggy, it was no longer a needed encounter.

This is something that I like, but also get frustrated by in WoW instances. So many quests for BRS/BRD/Strath/etc. can only be done in groups. But to get the most(loot) out of the encounter, people always go as raids for the sole purpose of loot gathering. Having played EQ for 3+ years previously, i know that for the most part these instances are doable as a group with skilled players. It is hard to find people in WoW that believe Strath is 1 groupable, much less want to try it.
<br />
Overall though, I like these quests that can only be done in group, and unobtainable by raid. It allows and makes those of us that like to follow the quests and storylines work for the reward it offers. And it allows me to find like minded people that know it's possible and are willing to do these instances as a group.
<br />

<br />
The article you quoted was pretty well written for EQ's current state, and hit the nail on the head.<br />

				Read this on the EQLive forums and essentially agree with most of what was posted. The last time I logged in a few months ago, I killed a MOB with my 27 cleric and sat for what seemed like 5 minutes to regenerate enough mana to kill the next MOB. Sitting down for the second time, I decided I would rather play an offline game and wait for the WOW server to come up.

      I don't know if I ever will come back to EQ as  I do feel like I have successfully thrown off my shackles. It is still a good game - I just would not want to risk getting hooked again.<br />

				EQ was so much fun and I can't really figure out why. I think one thing that turns me off about wow is how linear it is. How linear encounters are (You do it THIS Way..) how linear aggro is, how boxed in the game feels.. don't get me wrong, you can still ninja/do alot of cool stuff, but its nothing like EQ was.. bending the laws of the game mechanics was so l33t and fun:(.<br />

				I think the part mentioning the exploration and adventure part got missed by the vast majority of gamers, most likely because of the risk/reward problem.  No gain, no pain.  I like the EQ2 benny of getting a little bit of experience when you discover new things or craft new things. If EQ 1 had something like that, perhaps that would encourge people to try new things, etc.  I spent too many hours getting to the top of CoM without a rogue, but it was great when I finally finessed my way up.  Didnt get any treasure or exp bonus, but I wanted to see if it could be done.
<br />

<br />
That being said, I enjoyed my time in EQ1 pretty much because of the adventuring part.  Of course, not getting an exp rez til level 50 put me on the fast track for the slowest leveling Druid in EQ lore, so the death penalty portion of this discussion is right on track.  Exploring new areas and beating encounters without a tank or cleric or enchanter when those classes were "mandatory" provided the fun.  Getting a trinket had to be the bonus, because if you expected trinket reward and didnt get it, you would be very disillusioned.  I must have tangled with that all-too-rare named summoning SOB Lizard/dragon cant remember his name thingy in Burning Wood 50 times and never got the lousy cloak he drops.  But it was fun trying, and it was better than I had.  
<br />

<br />
I never did see King Xorbb, VP (although I finished the quest), ST, VT, and most of the raid areas of POP and beyond.  Sorry, but I got better things to do than wait around for 4 hours on a raid to start on a work night.  Besides, nobody raids those areas anymore...
<br />

<br />
I think EQ1 could do better by reutilizing the old zones.  They are virtually empty, as there is better exp-grinding and treasure elsewhere.  They could instance them and re equip them for special encounters.  They tried something like that for Qeynos Hills with the "rude individual", but it was poorly done, although I got my first procing weapon from one of them (a 5 pt "burn"...oooh!).<br />

				EQ had alot of room for trying thingd out your own way, if you so desired. When I played just a warrior, even with the limitations inherent with the class, I found plenty of 'crazy' things to try and went out of my way to make the most out of the few abilities I had and obtain the items that acted as tools to me to open up other avenues of play. When I became a bard, it opened up a TON of new options and experimentation for playstyles and fun. And finally, when Dariuse was transfered to his own account and I played a bard and warrior, the most fun and complex playstyle for me was developed. I think my favorite goofy thing I ever did was AE EVERY non summoning mob in the entire zone of Plane of Valor using a modified kite tactic and then finishing them at 50% hp by DA'ing on Dar, tabbing to Bes, fortitiduing and shakerpaging. It was just ridiculous fun. Deris saying messing with game mechanics to do cool stuff is fun, is totally the truth.
<br />

<br />
But hi to tangent. I think that article is hands on pretty much right. I loved my time spent with EQ and I will still defend that game to the bone because it IS amazing and for all its downfalls NO GAME EVER has entertained me as long or as much. I seriously doubt any game ever will again either. EQ is unique in this aspect.
<br />

<br />
WoW is a great game and fun. I think part of its seemingly simplicity and ease is the fact that playing EQ makes you a better player in a multitude of games. Hell, about 2 months ago I played FF3 for the Super Nintendo and I hadnt played that since before EQ. I raped the game because I was using EQ strats @#%$ and understood how to build my characters so much better and hell, I even grinded.
<br />

<br />
But, trying to play EQ now just seems to slow. It had its days, and I played every aspect of the game I could. My most valued experience would obviously be the time I spent leading a guild. The rewards I gained personally from that experience transcend the game as it offers a unique insight into the mechanics of people themselves. It was an interesting experience and definately yields benefit outside of gaming. 
<br />

<br />
Anyway, WoW is fun for me mostly because of the fast paced nature of the game and PvP. I seriously questioned the integrity of PvP in an mmo, but the fast paced nature of the game makes PvP really really enjoyable. I havent really dont to much of the large scale PvP action, but small scale 1v1 or 2-3v3 is a blast. There really is a large curve for player skill and I appreciate that. This holds true alot in PvE as well to my knowledge. Perhaps it also is the fact that 99% of the playerbase are retards and when you come along someine in that 1% they just seem extra impressive.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, Im basically just typing stuff because I am bored and I quite honestly am not even sure I made a post related to the topic, but just hearing about EQ brought back some memories so I felt like typing!<br />
