Seriously, have you see the @#%$ that passes for patents these days? I'm begining to think patents and copyright should simply be done away with in their entirety. I don't see any value for them in an information age. The public domain chaos that ensues will be far better (and far more productive) than the crap we endure now. Put your mind in forward mode and think about where all these developments are leading over the next twenty years.
<br />

<br />
So what if some genius comes up with an engineering idea and then cannot patent it? To hell with him. I'm getting sick and tired of the "idea" guys getting all the money and credit in the current system. I think the money and the credit ought to be going to the people who take that idea and USE it for something rather than sitting on it like some kind of hoarded nest egg. Let the ones who use the ideas and technology to actually do something get the rewards. The idea guy has first dibs on this beacuse it's HIS idea dna he's the first to know it, but if he doesn't move on it, he's got nobody to blame except himself for his failure to capitalize. In that situation everything intellectual is open to everyone, owned by no one, controlled by no one, and those who can use all this information the most effectively are the ones who come out on top.
<br />

<br />
That @#%$ about "innovation" dying because nobody can afford to do any research is just that, pure @#%$. The ones making the money will do the research because that's still the only way to progress in those fields, and if they don't, someone else will and they will get a leg up on those who don't. Innovation will hit an all time high because all the red tape that strangles the life out of it will be gone for good. It'll become something anyone can do without fear of stepping on some useless intellectual property laws and getting sued for the mere act of thinking.
<br />

<br />
So what if an artist makes music and then can't profit on the trade of it on the internet? Let them make it because they like it. They'll be able to make money from concerts if they are any good, and they'll earn plenty of respect and recognition from the folks who like it. Same goes for any artist or inventor. Artists make art because they just do. Compensation is not a prerequisite to art (sure, it helps, but it's not and shouldn't be the sole reason for the art).
<br />

<br />
Patents and Copyrights were all well and good in their time, but today they are holding us back. It's time for a sea change in thinking, and the entire concept of intellectual property needs to be done away with completely. This change is inevitable, it's going to happen no matter what people do. We can either be the ones to embrace it and benefit from it or the ones who are left behind when it happens elsewhere.
<br />

<br />
I've had enough of the lies about patents being the only way to ensure disclosure of manufacturing processes and scientific ideas or methods as well. What good is this disclosure? Nobody else is permitted to use it, so it's about as useful as putting your lunch in a sealed glass box and saying you can look but you can't eat it. What's the difference, really, between a company not disclosing a manufacturing process to keep it secret and a company who does disclose it, but no one else is allowed to use it or anything like it (at least without paying a huge fee to license)? We can do better than that.
<br />

<br />
The only danger I see in that system is people taking credit for another's ideas or creations, because the respect and recognition gained from good ideas and good creations becomes the only reward one can get in that system. The respect and recognition can themselves lead to financial gains, but money isn't guaranteed. As long as some form of registry is kept in place so that the original inventor is recognized, all is well and good.
<br />

<br />
And to hell with the lawyers. They are the only ones making a profit on this mess because their involvement is necessary at every step of the way. You will never see the legal profession lift a finger to fix this sytem because they all have far too much to gain from it staying exactly the way it is. Solve this IP problem and you will go a long way towards fixing some of the biggest problems with what passes for law in this country. Any such reform won't come from the legal system or the government; it'll be actively opposed by both of them as well as most corporations. It looks to me like this is a change that america is incapable of making. That means the think tank of the world won't be here for much longer. I'm thinking it's headed back to the east, over to India and China, whose time it appears is finally coming after all.<br />

				Doesn't matter, most people who get the patents aren't the orginal designers to begin with. The problem is that most people who invent it like to invent and don't care about patents. 
<br />

<br />
Good is example is Alexander Graham Bell, he invented the telephone, just a month after someone else did. The thing is the original inventer, who's name escapes me at the moment, didn't rush it to the patent office like Bell did, so when he sent to have it patented it was moments after Bell's had arrived at the office and so they gave it to Bell. There's quite a bit of that so eh, screw patents.<br />

				While I agree with some of the things you said,  sitting on a patent wouldn't be terribly effective.  Usually takes several years to get a patent, during that time it sits in "patent pending".  However, after a certain time in patent pending status your idea is released and can be copied by the general public.  So if you patent an idea and don't do anything with it, after a while someone can take and use your idea until your patent is approved.  After that, you can try to take legal action but the courts in the past haven't been to cooperative with those who don't do anything with the idea/product while it's in patent pending status.
<br />
What i find interesting is that a lot of patents are based on a process rather than the final product.  Like pharmaceuticals,  there are currently several companies working on a pill identical to Viagra, yet they can get around patents because they used a different method of creating it.

				Sitting on patents is all that corporations do anymore. IBM's patent portfoli is a thing of legend, and any time they get miffed at someone they nail them with a handful of patent lawsuits, since there is literally no business you can be in that does not infringe on some patent owned by IBM in some way. 
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/07/HNibmlawsuit_1.html" target="_blank">http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/07/HNibmlawsuit_1.html</a>
<br />

<br />
While I agree with your assesment of personal inventors, the courts behave very differently when dealing with a company that is sitting on patents. The majority of patents are held by companies now, and they can afford to sit on things forever if necessary. Some even patent things they never intend to use just to prevent their competitors from going in a certain direction.
<br />

<br />
 Just take a look at the dozens of highly publicized and very ridiculous patent lawsuits in the last few years. Patents are now a weapon used to strike down competitors and extort money from corporations. It's crazy. On top of that, you have people at the patent office approving patents that should not ever be approved... for example, just recently someone got a patent (they filed it in 2001) on the domain naming system (you know, site.subdomain.domain) that has been around since 1970 when the US Military invented the internet. That's the clearest case I've ever seen of the patent office with its head miles up its %@$#. The USPTO is reaching WTF? levels of stupidity.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Again, it can only be solved in court, and only the lawyers can benefit from it. All one has to do is sue someone with shallow pockets for patent infringement, and they've really got no choice but to settle since they can't afford the legal fees. It doesn't matter if the patent is clearly garbage, because only those with deep pockets can afford to pay the legal system to have it declared garbage and invalidated.<br />

				I think that's no coincidence too. Tech is the fastest moving industry, and tech is also the only industry that has products that do not physically exist. What you are seeing here is what you would be seeing in all aspects of the real world if we had the equivalent of star-trek style replicators that could duplicate physical objects and real property the way computers can duplicate intellectual property. Nice to know that by the time we have the replicator technology, we'll already have a working paradigm (well, one can hope) for economics and social behaviour from what arises out of this stage in the information age. It's fundamentally the same problem.
<br />

<br />
Another possible (even probable) outcome from this is that only the copy-lefted technologies and artworks will last, with the patented and copyrighted closed works simply becoming unused or forgotten and therefore worthless. It's an effective way to completely end-around the entire system and avoid the legal and licensing problems altogether. It's the best thing going for the little guy.<br />

<br />
But isn't it true that you can modify particulars to get the same result and bypass copyright infringment?
<br />

<br />
Like for instance.  Football goal uprights are copyrighted.  At least one particular schematic is, and all of the other people have just made them a different shape to not have to pay royalities.   A vulgarly simple example I am aware of.  But example nonetheless.
<br />

<br />
And there is areas where copyrights, or the effect of paying to use a copyright keeps very stupid people from trying to do intelligent people things.  Like anything from the medical field, and large manufacturing (assembly line) equipment.
<br />

<br />
Last thing I want is surgery done using a surgical tool designed by a moron who thinks he's smart, copied the tool in use, but did it wrong.  Same goes for an automobile in which I will drive at speeds of 70 MPH.
<br />

<br />
Everyone can yell all they want about the evils of copyrights, but you need to yell for the weaknesses to be fixed, not for an annihilation of the whole system, because it protects us as much as it holds us back.
<br />

<br />
Again it's the abusers that make the situation un-appealing.  Just like in every aspect of human life.
<br />

<br />
How do we fix that? increasingly staunch penalties for repeat offenders, capital punishment for murderers and rapists.  A free nation, not a welfare state.

I agree with you.  Patents are for processes, are temporary, and require the holder to actually produce from his property.  Deviation from those requirements will have disasterous results.  Really I think that the patent laws themselves and how they work may be a useful discussion rather than some ill conceived and bigoted flame on americans.

Pick up "Atlas Shrugged" or "the Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand if you need an illustration of how this works.

This is rather amusing, considering the number one web server software (apache), number one server operating system (linux), number one email system (sendmail), and number one name service stack (bind) are all open source products. With such low productivity they should have easily been overtaken by commercial alternatives by now, but strangely the commercial alternatives are consistently of poorer quality and smaller featureset than the free alternatives. This is proven fact.

I'd love to see some examples of open source projects stalling due to lack of funds. They came from nothing, and were far more likely to fail back during those early days than they are now. The longer a project lives, the less likely it is to ever die. If anything the development process is going to accellerate a thousandfold when India and China come on board later this year and throughout next year. They will greatly increase the developer base for open applications.
<br />

<br />
See, the reason communism fails in the real world is because when I take from you, you no longer have something. In the digital world, where the cost of a copy is zero, when I take from you I have left you with everything you had and I have enriched myself. This is even better if you have the same ability to take from me to enrich yourself. A respect system is firmly in place that encourages those who benefit from the community to give back to it, and those wishing to gain that respect even for selfish reasons still must contribute to earn it. One can of course choose not to contribute, but this does not diminish the whole in any way. Many do choose to contribute; more, in most cases, than are necessary to perfect a given project, especially a popular one.
<br />

<br />
These boards are an open source application. People go to Tym's website for his code modules.
<br />

<br />
It's like the town commons economic theory, except that the more cows you have grazing, the faster the grass grows and the more of it there is to go around. It turns conventional economics completely around, and is obviously a superior development methodology, as has been proven dozens of times over the last few years.
<br />

<br />
Educate yourself on the way these things really work. Also don't make the mistake of thinking open source is public domain... it isn't, in fact, and it forbids many kinds of uses that are allowed for public domain materials. Raymond sums the whole thing up far better than I could, and I'd say he's been proven at least mostly right by current events. You'll be seeing Linux commercials this year at superbowl halftime courtesy of IBM. Five years ago I was arguing with idiots who didn't think linux would survive because it had no hardware support and you needed a PhD in gizmos to get the thing installed and running. Today it's the number one software in the world in several categories, and it is a household term.

You'll note that Patents have no place in this system, and if anything are a threat to the way it works, due to their ability to impede developments that occur naturally in this process. Patents are an industrial idea, and they are no longer fit to function in an information society. Any system that slows down the adoption or use of a good idea is a threat.

Patents require the holder to produce nothing but lawsuits these days. This problem does not appear to be unique to the software world, either. Perhaps if patents were restricted soley to manufacturing processes it would not be so bad, but they aren't, so that is irrelevant. What they were meant to be is also irrelevant; it's what they are that matters.

<br />
My position is actually to just abolish the current one because it's clearly causing more problems than it's worth. If I could think of a better one, I would share it, but just because I can't think of a better idea does not mean that 1) the current system isn't a wreck and 2) a better system isn't needed. This is the kind of issue govermnets should be addressing rather than useless distractions like the death penalty. It takes the minds of many very smart people to solve these problems.
<br />

<br />
Search the net and you'll find there are a hell of a lot of artists who agree with the teardown of the current system... and they are in a far better position to make that judgement than I am. I'd imagine they are a bit tired of footing the bill for some fat record exec's latest sportscar, and who can blame them.
<br />

<br />
The artists aren't getting the money. I say the record companies shouldn't be getting it either. That has little impact on the artist, save for the few megastars the coporations whore us with in an attempt to create the next blockbuster record sale. Those are acceptable losses in my book, since they aren't even a tenth of a percent of the total.
<br />

<br />
The proliferation of open licenses are using the rules of the closed licenses to defeat them. The GPL is the best example of this in action. I strongly suspect that as open licenses become more common and accepted, you'll see the open products crushing the competition, unltil quite literally there is nothing left on the playing field except for the lone open solution. Monopoly by quality, and a form of competition that cannot be stopped or killed or strangled at a revenue stream or bought out... it's inevitable, really. That would be an Orwellian nightmare, except that the rules of the open solution allow anyone to use it for anything, so the tyrrany is one of freedom rather than control. It puts the users in charge and puts the abusers out of business. Seeing that kind of simple solution arise out of such a pile of wanton chaos and malice using its own rules to defeat it is almost enough to make me believe that some god somewhere knows what he is doing...
<br />

<br />
You want to know how these pointless artifical walls hold us back? Put your brain in what if mode for a moment and pull a John Lennon. Imagine what it would be like if the free use of all ideas and information was allowed, and the sum total of humanity's knowledge was at the fingertips of every living person. Add to that the sum total of every meaningful bit of artwork for inspiration and what do you get?
<br />

<br />
And please don't tell me you are foolish enough to think that nobody will create, research, or think for themselves in that society. In that society, the only things of value will be new ideas, new creations, and original thought. How people get paid is a petty secondary concern that will work itself out long after the walls come down.
<br />

If you want to know the end result, here is the long view.

A spectre is haunting Europe -- the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies, [Coca-Cola, Mc Donalds, IBM and Microsoft].

<br />

<br />
The history of all hitherto existing society [2] is the history of class struggles. 
<br />

<br />
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebian, lord and serf, guild-master [3] and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes. 
<br />

<br />
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations. 
<br />

<br />
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

Look, I hate to burst your bubble but the concept is not new.  The market wins in the end because it is a natural force of human interaction, not because it is a repressive construct of evil corporations.  Just like pecking order exists as a natural force in human interaction.  You can shape it with culture but if you try to erase it

No, it doesn't it proves the patent office allows some silly @#%$.  however the patent office is only a REGISTRAR. It sorts the best that it can with the resources it has and if there is a contention between people over the patent, then the court decides.
<br />

<br />
So, it is not the patent office that is the devil.  Its just underfunded.  If there is any basis in what you are saying you need to point to patent law and judicial ruling for how it is interpretted.  Someone elses rant (and your link goes to someone who says that what he is writing is a rant) is not evidence.
<br />

<br />
Show me that patents are not temporary and do not have to be produced on in order to be maintained for a long period of time.  There is allowance for having time to make it marketable but you have to produce an example of it working. No?

You will see more and more programmers stop working on programming and start working at steer manuer shoveling as the lack of payment for their creative work drives them to other things in order to feed their families, keep rain off their heads, get an education, etc... etc.. etc...

<br />
Look at the Linux distributions. They have added non open source pieces to linux to make it suitable to enterprise.  There are no real distributions that set up easily and cleanly, because that is where the profit is in support.  As time goes on the distributions will design themselves into more support reliant configurations and less and less of the actual distribution or stitching it together will be open source.  The core will be open source but in time as charity dwindles and "feeding the kids" becomes more important to people it will happen more.
<br />

<br />
Madrake is "now a profitable company."
<br />

<br />
Check out the prices for enterprise ready configurations for Red Hat.

<br />
SuSe will not let you DL installation ISOs you either have to connect to their server for install or gank all 6 gig (or just the portions you want if you can spend 30 man hours sorting through the packages).
<br />

<br />
I thank god for open source because it does provide a minimum bar of standard that has raised the bar on Microsoft and forced that unnatural monopoly to get on the ball or die.  It may die and that is the natural order of the market.
<br />

<br />
If it is smart Microsoft will just adopt Some flavor of open source as its own kernal one day and say thanks as it continues on with making interfaces for it with its vast ability to PAY developers to do it.  If it doesnt it will die, but that will not be the end of innovation nor of a profit based market.  It will simply be a shift in the order of things and into the hands of other innovators that will expect reward for their labor.
<br />

<br />
Open source is a holy rite of charity from man to man.  It should be revered as such and supported as such. Just like communism, its a great rallying cry but it is not a long term solution to patents. You cannot try and push it into somethign that is not freely participated in by the free will of men.
<br />

<br />
Just like communism it has this myth surrounding it that it will end patents (compare class struggle) period and is a tool to bring down the giant corprations which is absurd. It is a natural shift in the market in response to a monopoly that tried to bully the market. The strength of the people is felt in retaliation through banding together agaisnt a monster, however once the dragon is dead or subdued, the knight that champions the people must go home to his farm, or become a dragon himself.
<br />

<br />
Be careful of an unconsidered following of these neo-marxist idiots that are spouting rhetoric they are dientifying a phenomenon that is as old as trade, and callin it new. If you are not VERY careful you may find yourself commiting genocide or worse in the name of GPL or some other icon of the day.
<br />

<br />
After all who would have imagined that a man like Trotsky would spearhead a revolution in the name of oppresseed masses and then turn around and not even live to see it used to murder millions upon million upon millions.
<br />

<br />
It is not open source that is the danger.  Just like it was not communism as an idea nor in voluntary practice that was dangerous.  It was fools that tried to make it what it could never be that destroyed communism and turned mans want to do charity to his fellow man upside down on itself. Tthe same will be true with open source if this sort of non-sense diatribe is waved as its banner.<br />

That's one of the dumbest things I've heard a person say. Surely you can do better than thumping on a bunch of old textbooks (that are admittedly full of good ideas) and saying, "Because these men thought once upon a time I don't have to!"
<br />

<br />
It is new, and I'll tell you why: There is no Lord in control of these open technologies. If every reconstruction results in a Lord-Serf relationship, yet here we see a system that has designed the Lord out completely, how is that not new? One can indeed be influential with these new technologies, but only by contributing to them and making them stronger, and playing by their rules. This influence does not give you control. There is no Lord. You are looking at a newer, better incarnation of old ideas with a fundamental design change.

So essentially you are saying that you agree with me; the incompetence of the patent office is causing problems in open, unrestricted development of new technologies and clogging the courts with useless, @#%$ lawsuits, as well as providing an easy way for the big guy to push the little guy around.

Many a star programmer got his experience, recognition, and current job by contributing to open source projects while in school or unemployed. You are confusing the effects of outsourcing programming overseas with the maturity of the open source movement. The two are utterly unrelated phenomenon. Open source programmers do get paid to write open source; look at anyone working for Mandrake, Red Hat, SuSE, or IBM. IBM is being sued right now for the large amounts of code they *paid* to have developed and released into Linux. There is plenty of money in open source; many companies offer large sums of money to have a programmer extend an open application in a way that benefits them. They are paying for a product they need but then sharing the result of that product with everyone. This should be tax deductible.

Please cite these non-open pieces of code. You can't, because they don't exist. Mandrake is 100% GPL, SuSE is 99.99% GPL, with YaST being the only non-GPL component, but Yast IS licensed under a valid open source license... one that simply prevents commercial competitiors from taking it and using it in their products. RedHat has made some interesting design changes lately that are alienating some of the community, but you can still get the source code for everything they have without paying for it. If you want it for free you simply use <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">fedora</a> or <a href="http://www.whiteboxlinux.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink">whitebox</a> Linux. Any attempt to close off an open project fails in a similar manner, with open derivatives appearing and the majority of the developer base shifting to the open fork.

SuSE, Mandrake, and RedHat all install without much effort; they are no more difficult to install than Windows XP or Windows Server depending on what you are trying to do. Distros that are not easy to set up and install (such as Debian, Gentoo, Slackware, etc) still exist and are still popular, but are not commercial. The facts indicate that commercial distros are easier to install than free ones, and continue to become easier to install and use with each release.

It destroys their revenue stream, so yes, it will most definitely lay low any corporation that gets in the way. Take a look at the corpses of the myriad unix corporations that have been annihilated by the rise of Linux if you want proof. If linux becomes good enough, it'll destroy the competition in all desktop environments as well, most likely within the next ten years. It'll happen when Microsoft's license agreements and upgrade costs for the new version tick off a critical mass of users, probably with Longhorn's release in 2006. 
<br />

<br />
It's a simple choice... you can have this thing, for free, or this other thing, for a price. Your learning curve is the same, your upkeep costs are the same. The free one gives you more freedom, costs nothing, and has community support from millions. The other one costs a lot and restricts your freedom, and support costs you a lot of money. That's a pretty stacked choice.
<br />

<br />
Any information or object that reaches a near-zero copy cost will follow this paradigm.
<br />

<br />
It may be that money cannot be made on open applications; as linux rises so will google's base of knowledge about it, and it's already enough to replace pay-for support for any competent technician. The inability to make money, however, does not affect the existence or acceptance of the open application. If it did, they never would have existed in the first place. The one place money can always be made, however, is in extending and improving the open applications. Do you see the simplicity, freedom, and danger inherent in this paradigm now?<br />

				The idea behind patents and copyright isn't bad, but it's current implementation is seriously flawed.  Take the SCO threats against Linux users.  The hooplah this caused has probably set back hundreds of Linux companies by billions of dollars of total revenue this year.  Look at the patent office and check out the spurious patents that have been approved.
<br />

<br />
The concept of inventors, writers, artists and musicians retaining the exlusive rights to their inventions for a limited lenght of time is a good incentive to produce their works.  The current system whereby every time Mickey Mouses copyright is about to expire, Disney cons the government to extend the limitations on copyright is a bad idea.  Copyright and patent ad infinitum is an abhorent idea at best.  Imagine paying royalties on the Pythagorean theorem to the descendents of Pythagoras?  Productivity stagnates.  At some point in time, that so called 'intellectual property' becomes the property of humanity in general.
<br />

<br />
The granting of monopolies to produce a product should come with a cost.  Part of that cost is the research and work it takes to create the first copy of that product.  The other cost is that the monopoly must be time limited.  Should Leonardo Davinci's descendents hold a perpetual patent on the Helicopter?  Should Bell hold perpetual rights to the Telephone?  These inventions were pretty much destined to be discovered by someone - the story of the Telephone having two inventors shows that.
<br />

<br />
Patenting the obvious should not be allowed.  Unfortunately, pooly paid government employees who are probably overworked end up making the decisions.  I suppose there's a remedial process available, but you wouldn't know it from all the stories in the press about spurious patents and odious lawsuits that they spawn.  Sadly, those who can't afford the legal costs have no option but to give in to such bullies.<br />

You complain that Amazon owns a patent for a shopping cart system? Know what, thats exactly what they own, and they buit a chunk of economy doing it.  They took an idea and bloomed it into a massive company that proovided a basic service and was an archetype for internet commerce.

I'd say they will either be killed by it or forced to improve by it. One or the other is definitely going to happen. This improvement will surely happen fifty years too late for it to do any good, and there will be myriad examples of scum paying for patents on open ideas that they did not invent, and then using that patent to selectively push around those who can't afford to fight them in a court of law.

No. They built nothing. They <span style="font-weight: bold">stole</span> a public idea (using existing public code, even) and then used it to bully their competitors. Welcome to the way the patent system really works these days. They took a common practice that was being used by literally dozens of websites on the internet and patented it despite its widespread use, simply because nobody had patented it before. They then used this patent to bully around several other online venues who had been using similar one click systems and forced them under threat of lawsuit to change their systems into something less convenient for the shopper.
<br />

<br />
I suppose you still support a patent system that gives someone the right to do this.  
<br />

<br />
The plaintiff must show only evidence of infringement. The burden of proof rests with the defendant, who must show with prior art that the patent is invalid in order to defend himself. This isn't really that difficult, especially for the more ridiculous patents like the DNS Patent and Amazon's One-Click patent, but the catch is this: You still have to spend your time and energy (and money) in court, and that's very expensive. Little guys will settle rather than fight, and most of the time the kinds of people with these abusive patents don't pick on the guys who can afford to fight back. <a href="http://www.silicon.com/management/itpro/0,39024675,39117803,00.htm" target="_blank" class="postlink">(Except in this case.)</a>
<br />

<br />
Several open-source legal funds have arisen lately to fight this sort of thing, though they are currently untested. The presence of these funds shows that it is a very common problem, a big one, and a threat to open business models. The point is they shouldn't have to defend themselves in the first place. The only reason they have to is because the current patent office is wholly, ubelievably incompetent at doing its job. The patent office reserves the right to do all prior art research, and they've shown they don't understand many types of patents well enough to recognize prior art if it kicked them down a flight of stairs. I won't hear excuses on why... I don't care if they are understaffed, underfunded, stupid, whatever... there is an important job there that needs doing and it's not getting done. Fix it, because blame is pointless and excuses are a poor attempt to ignore the problem.
<br />

<br />
It's only going to get worse because new ideas are coming in at an exponentially increasing rate. What do we do when the office is a full ten years behind the industry? Suddenly you owe licensing fees on an idea that everyone accepted as open ten years ago? That's laughably unacceptable.
<br />

<br />
Fix or remove. I vote remove, since fixing something we no longer need is rather pointless. I'd love to see someone come up with a working version of how to fix it, but so far nobody has any ideas that stand up to even a moment's scrutiny.<br />

				Thats because you want everything to be free.  Someone else does the work, you get the profit.
<br />

<br />
You have yet to address why patents exist in the first place much less deal with how that would be affected. You make a blithe dismissal thta creative people would create anyway.  I have 200 years of history that shows that innovation was increased in countries with patent systems and countries without them lost their creative people.
<br />

<br />
I have creative people like Franklin, Samuel Clemons and Thomas Jefferson writing extolations on the idea of patents.  You have some middle class socialist brats ranting how everything should be free for the taking.
<br />

<br />
Money represents production.  The act of developing a product costs money.  If the developer has no garuntee in recouping his expenditure: Not only does he not have a motivation to spend his time on "new and novel" ways of doing things, but he would be throwing good money after bad.
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
As for your Amazon example. Bigger companies muscling out smaller less productive competitors is part of the game.  Again you don't get to have everyting nice and warm and fuzzy. You MUST produce to survive rather than coast on other peoples labors.  You must produce better than the other guy or he will destroy you.
<br />

<br />
That is not cruel, unusual or unproductive.  Mater of fact it is so productive a model that every competitive sport or game including EQ is modeled on the premise that competition means bullying for position (within the rules).
<br />

<br />
Tell me does Amazon still hold this patent or have there been enough instances of prior art that it is basicly invalidated as soon as it hits court?
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
Open source and Public License are being tossed around here like they are synonymous. They are not.  Open Source generally means source that is available for viewing and research.  It is an expectional idea.  I am also siding with the Germans in declaring that all software should be open source so that people can see what is REALLY going on if they have a need to.
<br />

<br />
Public License describes products that are released to the public domain (usually with some stipifiers) for general consumption.  That is the charity that I am talking about and the revolution that you are talking about.
<br />

<br />
However you view this revolution as a topping of patents. I see it as setting a minimum standard.  If the big boys do a lousey job (cough Microsloth) people doing charity work are going to out do them.
<br />

<br />
Linux did not blossum because giving away things that cost you resources to create is a good idea, it happened because the people rose up against monopolies that were seriously undermining the public trust.  I think that public license will continue to set a minimum standard.  Just like Government Cheese keeps the poor and indigent alive.
<br />

<br />
What's truely disgraceful is that Sun, Microsoft, HP, IBM and all those guys cut back on quality control and innovation so much that this phenomenon was able to shame them so quickly and easily.  In the case of OS's the government cheese tastes a heck of a lot better and is certainly more fulfilling than what you buy at a high priced restraunt.
<br />

<br />
In that analogy, I would not look to restraunts going away.  I would predict some restraunts going klunk, and others learning to cook with cheese and finding even better alternatives to draw customers in.<br />

				Texas Instruments was one of the inventors of the integrated circuit. They used to make all of their money manufacturing semiconductors (as well as calculators and computers). Nowadays 80% of their income is in licensing IP. When their patents expire, so will they. They could have spent the bucks to keep innovating like Intel or Motorola, but will fade away when their existing patents poof. 
<br />

<br />
There are many rediculous patents being issued. The patent office no longer tries to investigate whether they are original or not. They take the filing fees and let the folks with the deepest pockets duke it out in court. A common technique for enterprising folks is to dig up old dissertations from the 60s and 70s, file patent claims based on them and then sue everyone (and hope that no one can find the prior art). Dissertations in the 80s started to become available electronically, making that decade rather risky for this sort of trickery. 
<br />

<br />
Why was there no patent for waterbeds? Someone tried to patent one in the early 70s, but the patent examiner remembered reading a description of one in an old Heinlein novel from the 40s. That industry thrives without patent protection. So patents are not necessary for an industry to thrive. They can help, but one can live without them.
<br />

<br />
Another enterprising technique is to keep modifying the claims of your patent while it is being investigated by the patent office. This way, any changes in technology can be re-addressed in your claims, and the initial date that you filed the patent is what counts for filing lawsuits. The guy who claimed to invent single chip microprocessors did this, it took about 20 years from when the original claims were filed until the patent was actually issued. Because his original claims were in the system, all subsequent patent applications for single chip microprocessors were denied. They call these patents "submarine patents" because they appear out of nowhere, and sink whole industries with their 9 and 10 digit demands for royalties (per company). 
<br />

<br />
Companies usually try to beat down other companies' patents with a number of tricks, like claiming that it is obvious, or that prior art exists. Sometimes, they just prolong the legal shennanigans until the plaintiff has to drop their suit because they ran out of money. Microsoft likes to play that game, using other folks inventions and paying the 8 and 9 digit settlements out of petty cash, if the plaintiff lives that long.
<br />

<br />
Sample silly patents:
<br />
British Telecom claims to own a patent on hyperlinks.
<br />
Compton Multimedia claimed to own a patent on WWW and multimedia (patent revoked).
<br />
A patent for entering text by pressing buttons on the keypad of your phone. For example, to enter the letter F, press the 3 button 3 times. To enter the letter K, press the 5 button 2 times.
<br />
A patent for using CallerID to look up data in a computer.
<br />
A patent for putting navigation menus on the top or left of the screen. Optionally, the menus do not move off screen when the text is scrolled up and down. 
<br />

<br />
Patents can be useful for protecting your interests, if and only if you can afford the lawyers to defend your claims. Unfortunately the system is being gamed by folks who would rather use the legal system to deprive you of your patents, or to compel you to pay for someone elses invention. The system has lost the virtues that poppa was referring to. That system fizzled away and died in late 20th century. If the patent office were the same as it was in the early 70s, it would not be issuing these bogons: <span style="font-style: italic"> and we would not be having this discussion</span>. The myth about "inventing a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door" never really existed. It is a nice ideal, and I wish it were close to true, but it is not, nor ever was. 
<br />

<br />
Amazon's patent was for 1-click shopping. They still have it. Barnes and Noble lost in court. Amazon doesn't own a patent for shopping carts, because there was too much prior art to get one for that. The 1-click patent had very little to do with their success, having a massive inventory and shipping it on time was what made them a better place to do business than B&N. B&N was more obsessed with buying up competing brick and mortar stores than in an online presence: wanting to be the only place you can buy a book at because all the other chains are part of the borg, and every store had the same inventory as each other. Almost all the market is taken up by Borders, B&N and Amazon. Independant bookstores are almost all gone: I predict they will vanish as the owners retire or die. Most college campus bookstores are actually owned by B&N.
<br />

<br />
IBM lost out on OS2 because Microsoft had better marketing. All the things that keep getting hyped as new and improved for windows were already in OS2 years before it was in NT4, Win9x, Win2kx, ME or XP. But the propaganda about "innovation" won out over the truth.<br />

Not quite. Everyone does the work, everyone gets the benefit (benefit is not necessarily profit). If every idea on the planet is open, the one who builds the best toys with those ideas win. The market becomes one of pure quality. Stop pretending that having all of these ideas open and royalty-free will prevent anyone from buying anything. Quality will drive the market, and the market will move faster than it has ever moved before, because the @#%$ red tape will simply be gone.

I don't care why they exist. I only care about the obvious damage they are doing. You've yet to respond to any of my points about how harmful the system is to open ideas. As for your 200 years of history, here's a news flash. It's about as relevant today as a phalanx of roman soldiers would be facing off against the US Army. The times have changed, the playing field is very different. Stop thumping on history books and use your mind.
<br />

<br />
I guarantee you that if you were to ask Sam Clements, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson about the state of the current patent and copyright systems, they would be absolutely horrified that their good work had been perverted into a tool to abuse the rights of individuals and lock up good ideas so that only the wealthy could profit. I can easily imagine Clements going off on a tirade about it. If introduced to the concept of these new open methods hitting the market, they would be stunned that people would be able or willing to cooperate on the scale necessary to make them work, and while I can't say for certain I'm sure they'd favor a system that increases the wealth of human knowledge and provides an economy based on quality over the system we currently have.
<br />

<br />
They'd still agree that those who invented the ideas should get some kind of benefit, and I don't disagree with that. I'm simply stating that we must find a way to make that work in an open system where the idea is free to all once created. The founding fathers might even have been able to see a way to do that; they would certainly be sympathetic to it.

<br />
No. Compensation for production comes in many forms. Say rather that production is represented by an enrichment of the lives of the producing parties, and money is the easiest way to do this at this time. It's a subtle difference but I think it is important. How do you assign a monetary value to the immense respect Linus has garnered for all the free work he did creating Linux? You can't really, but his life has been enriched by it. He earned an honorary Ph.D from U of Finland, and his resume guarantees him a job anywhere he goes looking for one. It wasn't monetary compensation, even though it puts him in a position to earn more monetary compensation than he would have otherwise been able to.

That argument has no relevance whatsoever on the Amazon issue. A clickable shopping system is not the product of that company, it's simply a mechanism they ripped off and patented for selling to customers. They are coasting on the labors of other people who were using similar sales systems. You are essentially defending their right to steal and patent public ideas and then use them to interfere with another competitors' ability to sell their product to their customers online.

<br />
Dead wrong. Here's where your misunderstanding is shown. That which is in the public domain is free for anyone to use at any time without any strings attached, not even the need to put up a notice of its use. There are no rules of any kind governing its use. This is not what we want, because in that system there is no form of recognition for one's works and contributions. This is too loose, too free. There has to be some form of recognition, some requirement to at least acknowledge the works of the contributor whose work you are using.
<br />

<br />
The GPL is so successful because in addition to the recognition, it requires you contribute any further developments you make back into the pool of GPLed software unless you plan to use them only for yourself, privately. Have you thought for a moment how much this can cut down on the costs of R&amp;D? If your goal is 90% achieved by the open methods, you can either do that 90% of the work (and spend 90% more in cost) yourself so that you own the entire solution, or you can use the open method, add in that 10% it was missing for your purposes, and then release that 10% back to the community. You just saved 90% of your costs and increased the public knowledgebase at the same time. This is a win-win. The same concept can be applied to any market or industry; it is not restricted to computer code only.

<br />
This minimum standard is slowly but surely enveloping everything in the software market. There are technologies arising from open source projects that totally outstrip their commercial competitors. Apache is the best example of this. How can the very best product be a "minimum standard" when nobody can hope to top it? In that system, nobody is ever going to bother to try; they'll just use the open solution and extend it to fit their needs. Your minimum standard has several hundred thousand times the developer base of any closed standard, and so no closed standard will ever be able to compete with it. Closed standards will eventually be crushed out of existence.

<br />
Your scenario has a flaw. The restaraunts aren't going to be the victims of this revolution. The cheese vendors are.
<br />

<br />
If the government's cheese is so good, why bother trying to make a new kind of cheese? Any competing cheese vendors' innovations can easily be duplicated by the government in that scenario, so essentially the cheese vendor competition is all doomed to go out of business. If anyone wants a new kind of cheese, they'll draw upon the public resources to create it and release their new cheese back into the government pool. They'll have their new cheese, but so will everyone. Clearly, no money can be made creating new kinds of cheeses, so cheese creation becomes a matter of necessity (or, get this, art!) rather than profit. Different driving force, same result, cheaper R&amp;D since you can draw on the public base.
<br />

<br />
The money is being made by the restaraunts who use that cheese to create some exciting dishes. So what if the recipie for that dish is available to everyone? Sure, you can make it at home, but sometimes you just don't want to do the work of cooking. Sure, every restaraunt has their spin on dish x, but when word gets out that Cheezeorama has the best one, they are the one to make the buck. Now you've forced the restaraunts to compete on the quality and price of their dishes rather than the uniqueness of their recipies.
<br />

<br />
And the government cheese is still there if you don't need the variety and want to save money.
<br />

<br />
Look at what this means for the people: All the free cheese you can eat, new cheeses being discovered as they are needed or invented for fun by some well respected cheese geniuses, and a ton of really kickass restaraunts. There's also a lot of recognition to be had if you can advance the field and everyone is eating a dish using your cheese because it kicks %@$#.

<br />
This is the crux of what is blinding you.  You are arguing apples against oranges while Im just talking fruit.
<br />

<br />
The crux of my position is that patents as a concept and as they are efficiently used are a powerful engine for innovation and 200 years of history is damn good.
<br />

<br />
The current implementation of the patent process is too bulky and costly for most to traverse.  It is also dangerous because it threatens that which is in the public domain and discourages the openess of commecial source code so that people can rightfully see what those instructions sets are "really" doing with their private data.
<br />

<br />
I conceed all of that; However, I do not conceed that throwing the baby out with the bathwater is a viable solution.
<br />

<br />
The problem is that the patent office should be doing a better job at sorting for prior art.  I think that we should be pushing for an increase in that systems infrastructure and an overhaul of their processes. The fault lays in the courts and their inability to comprehend technology and adapt quickly to a changing information environment.  They are not doing a good job at judging what is novel and what is obvious.
<br />

<br />
That does not require that patents be thrown out.  Courts change slowly for a reason and to force quick change on them could have disasterous effects.  We have courts in order to slow knee-jerk reactions.
<br />

<br />
I think that a better solution to the dilemma you rail against is defendants being sued by the likes of Amazon that have patented something that is already in the publiic domain pooling together and breaking them with counter suits as a class action.
<br />

<br />
We are at a transitional time where innovation has taken off at a wildly accelerating pace.  There is tension because the courts and the market have not developed systems to deal with the new load.
<br />

<br />
It is the nature of the market to develop ways of dealing with the theives and the leeches and the courts will adapt as the landscape of the problem becomes more clear.<br />
