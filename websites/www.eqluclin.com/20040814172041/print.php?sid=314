<font class="print-normal">Website is underway for Raid Addicts Luclin's Public Raiding Union, This site will include a member roster, an application form, Forums, and talks are underway of even setting up a more practical looting method for people who have been in the union for some time..  <br>
<br>
This Raid Cult has been put together by Mortenson of Sods Law (ME) and Aomir of Endorean.  <br>
<br>
There will be TWO phases to this project<br>
<br>
PHASE 1.   All Luclin Server members are allowed to join the channel RA and go to any of the raids we host. Loot will be rolled upon with the old 10 X Level method of rolling. There will be active forums and probably IRC chat at some point for this, We ask that everyone who is interested in Phase 2 to be very active in this channel.<br>
<br>
PHASE 2.   At a later date there will be a handpicked amount of you to form a Raid Addicts Elite channel.  This will be most likely already EP geared people with more than 300 AA. This crew of people will do everything this game allows, because I am hoping it will be the Best Raiders of Luclin...<br>
<br>
Some things to keep in mind<br>
<br>
i.   We are not out to upset the server by (what has recently come to my attention) flagging every n00b on this server with Elemental Access. We will be doing flagging yes, and People will be flagged but I do not consider the people  I personally invite to be n00bs but professional people who deserve to see the rest of the game.  <br>
<br>
ii.   Any Raid Addicts potentials, or Members will be asked to leave if I find out you are skipping your GUILD raids to go on our raids.  (Again We do not wan to upset this server) <br>
<br>
iii.  Any officer, leader or concerned person of any guild is welcome to send me a tell at anytime (Mortenson) if you have any questions or concerns about any of this. I am an open minded person and I will listen to reason, if there is a concern please tell me.<br>
<br>
iv.  The people on our raids are important to us, Please send us a tell if your unhappy with something (don't whine tho). However don't confuse kindness with weakness, any unruly conduct on my raids will be reason enough for me to ask you to leave. We are not trying to make for ourselves a BAD NAME. Even though you have your own guilds, This too is a guild in a way. And I would like it's reputation to be left in tact.<br>
<br>
V.   Guilds of Luclin, We are not out to overpower you or cause trouble, We are out to help you in every way possible.  Backflagging or whatever the reason send me a tell I will always be most willing to listen.  The real reason behind this idea is to Unify Luclin. (perhaps thats a bit impossible)<br>
<br>
And last this is an ever changing and growing project, I am sure more of these rules will be added as we progress and learn. Be patient with us and never hesitate to give me or Aomir a tell in game.<br>
