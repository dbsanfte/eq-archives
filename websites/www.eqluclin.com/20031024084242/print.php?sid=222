<font class="print-normal">Found on <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp?id=57689">EqLive</a>, there are several updates coming for the patch on August 6th... most notably new fletching recipes, the ability to share plat through the shared banking system, spells for summoned Burning Affliction focus items for magicians, /memspellset command, and the long awaited Guktan illusion (not replacing the froglok illusion, in addition to!). Also, it appears as though there's a new adventure or &quot;zone&quot; awaiting in Lavastorm...<br>

Chick the article title for the full article here, or there's always <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp?id=57689">EqLive</a>.<br /><br />
Upcoming for August 6th, 2003 - updated 7-31-03<br>
It's been a little hectic around here lately, with all the Live, Legends and expansion work going on.  We're busy in that good way, where you get a lot done every day but tomorrow there's just as much to do.<br>
<br>
New adventure unearthed in Lavastorm!  In the depths of the Lavastorm mountains there is only one ruler.  But even his burning breath and power have their limits.  Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach.  These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden.  Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value.  Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself.  But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted.  Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?<br>
<br>
New fletching recipes will be added.  We're adding a few new fletching recipes.  The resultant items will only be usable by Rangers that worship Karana, and will be comparable to their Tunare counterparts.<br>
<br>
Guktan Illusion will be implemented.  Yup, the long-awaited new illusions will be available.  While the old Illusion: Froglok spell is just as popular as ever, folks have been asking for an illusion based on the new Froglok models.  After our next update, both will be available.<br>
<br>
Adding summoned Burning Affliction items to the Magician's arsenal.  Four new summoned items with the new Burning Affliction focus ability will be introduced.  This rounds out the Magician's ability to create summoned focus items.<br>
<br>
UPDATE:  Well, one of the hazards of trying to talk about what will happen in the future is that someone will make a mistake.  This time it was me.  The upcoming update on August 6th will not include any code changes.  We hope to update again at the end of the month with the code changes that will move the features listed below to the Live servers.  I'm sorry for the mistake. - Alan<br>
<br>
We will be adding platinum to the Shared Bank.  In order to allow folks to transfer money between characters on the same account in the same way that they can now transfer items, we will be adding a spot in the Shared Bank for placing platinum. <br>
<br>
New filters and chat message options will be added.  We have separated pet melee messages into their own category.  You will be able to send them to whichever chat window you want, or filter them out completely in the Options window.  We have also added the ability to send /random messages to any chat window you'd like.  There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, you can't claim that you didn't see the /random that you lost just to force a re-roll).<br>
<br>
/memspellset command will be added.  This new command will allow you to memorize the spell set you indicate (using the corresponding number) from the command line or from a hot button.<br>
<br>
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.<br>
