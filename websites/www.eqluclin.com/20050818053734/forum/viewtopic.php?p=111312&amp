What you are saying is that since I have no idea of the amount of effort that goes into a creative work, I have no respect for the terms of the laws that protect those who have put in the time from recouping their investment. This is a rather typical baseless assumption on your part. Perhaps you should simply accept the fact that I know as much as if not more than you do about this issue, and I have rationally arrived at a vastly different set of conclusions in this arena than you have, and leave it at that. Time will tell who's beliefs are correct; the market will decide as it always does. As a thought exercise, however, you may want to consider things were <span style="font-style: italic">significantly</span> more in favor of your belief system ten years ago, and are now rapidly swinging around to my way of thinking. Such trends do not reverse easily.
<br />

<br />
If I weren't currently writing the baseline for a series of science fiction novels, you might have had a point, however tactless your accusation was. If I thought it was a dollar of work before, the reality of the job is worth a million dollars. If you'll remember, it took Tolkien decades to write his baseline for LoTR, and believe me I can see precisely why. You have to write an encyclopedia of research about your novel before you can really begin to write it. What's worse... if it's science fiction, and a new technology breaks, it can turn your vision of the future inside out and leave you with mountains of rewriting to do. <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~judithberman/fiction/sffuture.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">Scifi has lost sight of the future </a>because of that and if I write this thing that's one thing I intend to change. I have a very good understanding of the amount of work that goes into even something as simple as a novel of a few hundred pages. It is very hard work to maintain an illusion of reality and remain as factually correct as possible. Writing is sustained telepathy, one of the hardest arts there is, and there's nothing like poor prose or broken facts to break that tenuous link.
<br />

<br />
And I still support limited copyrights. I value the public domain far more than you do. I consider it far more important than any one man's work. That's the difference in philosophy between us. If what I write somehow ended up as popular as Tolkien or Star Wars, I'd voluntarily release the copyright on it after ten years (and a couple feature films; I can put that kind of money to good use for humanity) just to prove a point to people like you. I'd then be rubbing every addition to the body of the work created by other people in everyone's faces as proof that my way of thinking is more beneficial to society and the right way to go. I for one would like to live to see what kind of effect my creations would have on the creative talents of other people, and I can't do that if it is chained up in copyright law. How anyone who can create something like that can bring themselves to let it rot away that way is utterly beyond my comprehension. I can understand why corporations would treat IP that way, but not the original creator.

<br />
I don't feel it is the morally right and ethical thing. I find locking works up in copyright for extended periods of time to be unenlightened, selfish, self-centered, and morally repugnant. I find it criminal; a detriment to society. I won't concede to your views on the subject, having thoroughly considered all of your arguments and the arguments of people on your side of this issue and rejected them as irrational and bound up in inferior ways of thinking that are stuck in the past. I live in the same world that you do, as do plenty of other people who feel the same way that I do. You have to share the world with people who feel that way, so you get to suck up and cope with it just like we cope with your draconian restrictions on information. Neither one of us will ever get the laws they want; we get a halfassed compromise and a real world mess instead. Such is life, and the state of any issue.
<br />

<br />
Given enough time, the generation that grows up with this free flow of information will be making the laws and running the globe. You're fooling yourself if you think things won't change then.
<br />

<br />
Zerg is quite right, this is all a market correction, probably the largest one we will ever witness in our lifetimes. Just as linux was a free market response to Microsoft's monopoly, so too is p2p a response to the intellectual property situation. If you think it's bad now, just you wait two or three decades and listen to the screams when the pendulum swings the other way, and creative commons licensing locks the world information market into free commodities.

Every post I make you say that in your response. It's your mantra, but it still hasn't made you right. If all of these ideas and market forces I champion weren't real, linux wouldn't exist, and I wouldn't have Ep. III spoilers sitting on my desktop. This website wouldn't be here either; you think we'd <span style="font-style: italic">pay</span> for a license for a message board like this? Clearly, I'm experiencing a part of reality you don't have access to, or are willfully trying to avoid acknowledging. Denial is not just river in Egypt. I don't "disagree with everybody else on this issue" either. That's another fiction you've made up. Since over fifty percent of internet traffic is bittorrent, and we all know damn well that the majority of it is copyrighted material, I'd say you're the one in the minority opinion here, not me. I could be wrong, of course, but that's a lot of traffic to explain away by any other means. The fantasy world is the one you're trying to cling to, the one the information age is starting to make irrelevant. Progress is too fast, and too important. Technology and art are not going to wait for the law. If law gets in the way, law gets changed, ignored, or ground underfoot. Just like p2p is doing today.

Pink Floyd isn't making money on DSoTM. EMI records is. If the band themselves were making the money on it, I would be far more sympathetic. If some rapper wants to use a sound sample from DSoTM for his rap compilation he should hardly be financially liable for it, yet that is the way the law works today. That's ridiculous.

I completely agree. The piracy is only a problem because the copyright holders refuse to provide customers with what they want at a price they want, and so consumers use alternative (and illegal) methods that happen to be financially devastating, highly effective, and nearly immune to law enforcement to do get the intellectual property anyway.

No, it's worse. I've accepted money for someone else's property. That's direct financial gain. That's a different beast then snapping my fingers and making a duplicate of something for myself, or for a friend for free, which do not result in financial gain. Believe me, I've had people offer me money for things like modding an Xbox, burning them a DVD of something... I have not and will never accept it. That's where my definition of actual theft begins. Perhaps my morality remains an enigma to you; that's fine, just take my word on it, there's a big difference.
<br />

<br />
If your point is that by giving my friend a free copy of something I am denying the creator a sale, sometimes you're right, sometimes you're wrong. I always encourage them to buy whatever it is if they like it. Always. That doesn't mean they can afford it. They may buy it five years from now, or decide they don't like it and never buy it. Perhaps they can't afford it (Adobe Photoshop, for example). One download of Windows XP does not equal one lost sale of Windows XP, regardless of the phony math their lawyers would feed you. The courts have, finally, come to realize that themselves lately.
<br />

<br />
I would happily pay for most of the music I've got, if I could get it in a lossless, non-DRM format online, preferably on a song-by-song or subscription basis. You be sure and let me know when a music service offering that goes online. Until then, they won't be getting my money. I'm still waiting.

Yes, skyrocketed in fact and reversed a regression trend. I'd say that handily disproves their myth that copyright infringement is hurting their business. I see no reason whatsoever to believe the MPAA when they say the same thing about movies, and @#%$ them twice for lying about it. DVD sales have outrun theater ticket sales. Clearly, there's a disjunction between reality and that line of @#%$ they feed the judges in the courtroom.<br />

				Part of this is the fault of the MPAA and RIAA.  The RIAA fought mp3 format for a very long time, just like they did CDs and casettes, instead of embracing the technology from the beginning.  The MPAA is doing the same thing with DivX, just like they did with VHS.  If both had embraced the technologies from the beginning, the copyright infringement problem wouldn't be nearly as bad as it is now.  It would still exist, but I think the scope of it would be much more limited.
<br />

<br />
Raviel, as much as I agree with some of what you're saying, you're still rationalizing why it should be ok for you to pirate music and movies.  Like it or not, once something is released, it should not become public domain.  Public domain implies that no one can profit from it, and that's not right.  Copyright limitation to fifty years or so, sure.  No problem with that.  But the creator of the book/movie/song/whatever should be ensured their ability to make money from their creation for a long period of time.  What it comes down is, they made it, not you.
<br />

<br />
Please note I'm arguing against my own interests here.  Just because I like having the ability to do something doesn't mean I don't still think it's wrong for me to do it.

You know, I hadn't considered that. You're absolutely right. The independents would stand to make the most because now that people can easily find and preview music, they have realized there are good bands out there and are buying again. But they won't be buying from major labels, since the labels manufacture most of their music and it therefore sucks. What's your preference... studio-created drivel like Britney Spears, or real talent like Green Day and Dave Matthews? I know which one I prefer.

Yes. FLAC is king. Gimme FLAC downloads every time.
<br />

<br />
I should probably clarify why I dislike CDs. First, price, but there are ways around that. Second, it's straight up retarded to use them as a distribution mechanism. Don't put bits on plastic, then put plastic in boxes, then put boxes in stores, pay for people to work the stores, pay for security, install annoying anti-theft devices that take me an hour to cut through without a chainsaw, and then expect me to go to the store and buy the product just so I can take it home and pull the bits off before throwing the plastic away. Just give me the goddamn bits directly over the wire and we're all happier. Easier for me, cheaper for you. And I expect that reduction in distribution costs to be passed partially to me in the form of cheaper-than-retail downloads.
<br />

<br />
I'd feel the same way about DVDs if there was any way to get that much data across the wire cheaply (and there will be in a few years). Until then purchase of DVDs is fine. I'll have them archived long before they ever decay.

I can't disagree with that. I do wish, however, that there was some way to make the compensation more voluntary (after sampling the product) and more transparent, while at the same time providing everyone with access to the entire body of works. That just seems right somehow. I want the artists compensated, but I want everything at my fingertips as well. I don't know how one turns that into a business model. If I did, I'd be a billionaire in no time.

<br />

<br />
Choice tidbits...
<br />

<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote"> Ramos: I apologize. Forgive me. The 10% that Mr. Frackman referred to and that Judge Noonan, forgive me, Your Honor, asked about. We were not able to determine whether those were infringement or not. In other words, we couldn't figure out what those were. We did not find any of the examples that were given by the defendants. We didn't find the Bible, we didn't find Shakespeare, we didn't find any of the noninfringing works or categories of noninfringing works they referred to. We just weren't able to identify them. Those may be infringing as well. We put forward a survey that showed that we were able to determine that 90% were infringing. They did not put forward any competing survey, so there's no opposing evidence on the other side saying that 10% is noninfringing or any other number is noninfringing. That is the sole record here and as Mr. Frackman said, I think 90% is by definition higher than 87%. 
<br />

<br />
Second, defendants claim that all they do is distribute software. In fact, they do much more. They upgrade software, they promote their services, they filter out pornography and computer viruses, but let's just focus on the software, and demystify it a little bit.
<br />

<br />
Software is a set of instructions. This court has said that before, that is what software is. It's instructions to a general purpose computer to do something. And here those instructions are to create a massive network for trafficking in pirated music. This includes instructions to use these computers to become supernodes, listing available music and movies, to ultra peers, to identify other users who have copyrighted content, and most significantly those instructions include a hook that requires that the user's computer go back to the defendant's web site every time they enter the network, so they can sell their advertising. That's key here, as Mr. Frackman said. There is a continuing relationship between the defendants and their users, and they are following the instructions that created the network, that creates the site and facilities that this court spoke about in Napster.
<br />

<br />
There's no question that if the defendants had formed a network for trafficking in physical pirated goods, by distributing instructions to each of the participants in how to copy and distribute the pirated goods, they'd be liable, irrespective of whether they were careful to be sure they weren't physically present at the moment the goods changed hands because they wanted to argue later, "We couldn't stop that sale; we weren't there." They would be liable. So why is it any different here? The defendants use the talismatic term "technology", as if that's going to give them immunity, and I would suggest to this court, the Internet is not a license to steal. There's nothing different from what they're doing from organizing and instructing the participants in a trafficking network that is trading in counterfeit materials than what they are doing. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Judge Noonan: Let me say what your problem is. You can use these harsh terms, but you are dealing with something new. And the question is, Does the statutory monopoly that Congress has given you reach out to that something new? And that's a very debatable question. <span style="text-decoration: underline">You don't solve it by calling it theft.</span> You have to show why this court should extend a statutory monopoly to cover the new thing. That's your problem. </span>
<br />

<br />
Ramos: Your Honor...
<br />

<br />
Judge Noonan: So address that, if you would...
<br />

<br />
Ramos: Your Honor, I would be, I. . .

The record here is replete with undisputed evidence that the Morpheus and Grokster products are being used today to distribute millions of authorized video games, millions of authorized songs, Jive Media has distributed hundreds of thousands of authorized music videos for one artist alone. Famous bands such as Widespread Panic, Pearl Jam, Fish, Dave Matthews Band, have all authorized the sharing of their live concert recordings among their fans&gt; In fact, contrary to Mr. Frackman's representation, appellant's own expert in searching the network was unable to avoid finding the Bible, the Koran, and the Communist Manifesto, demonstrating the use of these networks to distribute public domain materials. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The record is undisputed that these pieces of software are capable of substantial noninfringing uses, the appellants here do not seriously contest the capability for noninfringing use.

They argued then that proportion should be the test, that primary use should be the test, and they argued, again, contrary to Mr. Frackman's representation, that the Betamax could be easily modified so as to prevent or reduce the incidence of infringing uses. On that point in particular I direct the court's attention to page 494 of the Sony ruling in Justice Blackman's dissent, in which he discusses this so-called "jamming" possibility. The Supreme Court nevertheless rejected those arguments, as this court should here today. . . 
<br />

<br />
Judge Noonan: Oh, you know, I think you're absolutely right as far as the matter of Sony goes. Your problem is the gloss that Napster managed to write on it.</span>
<br />

<br />
[laughter from audience]
<br />

<br />
von Lohmann: I would agree with your *earlier* question, Your Honor, that of course [much laughter] the Sony ruling must control. But I will say this: I think the Napster gloss is not nearly the problem that appellants would have you believe. In fact, appellants distort, what I think the perfectly sensible ruling in Napster was by saying, in fact, that any notice delivered to a defendant automatically deprives them of the Betamax defense. That is not the holding of the Napster opinion. On page 1021 of this court's Napster ruling, the court extensively discusses what more needs to be shown before a defendant can be held liable. Judge Wilson read that portion of the Napster opinion closely, and concluded, in conjunction with other precedents on this point such as the Vault vs. Quaid case in the Fifth Circuit, that more is required merely than notice -- that there has to be specific knowledge coupled with, in conjunction with, the capacity to act on that knowledge. <span style="font-weight: bold">The rules suggested by appellants would lead to terrible results. Imagine, for example, if delivering a stack of notices to Xerox regarding the misdeeds of a Kinko's copy shop would suddenly make Xerox liable. They, after all, would then have actual knowledge, as the appellants constantly reiterate. Actual knowledge is not enough under the Sony case, and under this court's Napster ruling. There has to be a conjunction of actual knowledge, with material contribution. That was the piece that was missing here, as Judge Wilson correctly found below.</span>
<br />

<br />
Judge Boochever: It's undisputed here that the defendants had actual knowledge, right?
<br />

<br />
von Lohmann: It is undisputed that notices were delivered to these two companies regarding specific infringements that allegedly were occurring on the network. I would agree that that would create actual knowledge under this court's Napster ruling. Of course, as Judge Wilson found, that alone is not enough.<span style="font-weight: bold"> If it were, the Sony case today could be relitigated to a different result simply by delivering a stack of notices to Sony regarding users of VCRs who were committing copyright infringement.</span></td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

One thing always amazes me. I love watching learned experts in rationality and logic (as judges tend to be) slicing and dicing irrational or illogical arguments. You can instantly spot the people in court who have been basing all of their arguments on assumptions and opinions, because they inevitably end up falling on their faces the second the justice takes them to task for it. The look on their faces when they realize they can't simply appeal to sympathetic rhetoric is always priceless. I think that's one of the biggest reasons people like People's Court or Judge Judy.<br />

				I'd have to say there may be something to that. Easily trackable P2P (Napster, Grokster, Kazaa, etc) is not the kind of thing a real hacker who wants to do damage would write. Real Hackers write something like <a href="http://waste.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Waste</a> (courtesy of Justin Frankel of Winamp fame).
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/introduction.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">Bittorrent</a> was originally written not to pirate materials, but to nullify the costs of distribution (a much more dangerous idea). BT's goal is to give everyone the ability to broadcast anything to everyone. That spells @#%$.e.d in big media terms. Copyright isn't the whole issue.

Of course, the two ideas fit rather naturally together, despite arising from different needs.<br />

Bad comparison.  You get to test drive the car.  You don't get to take it out in all possible road conditions, see how it handles impacts first-hand, and have the ability to manufacture and distribute the car from that test drive.

				I like the idea of preview before you buy.  It could be done for music in the form of low quality MP3's on the companys/bands website.  Some do it already but they should all put 64kbs quality MP3's on there sites.  I hate buying an album only knowing what 1 or 2 songs on it are.<br />

I wont do it myself.  I stopped buying as albums phased out.  That joke in MiB about having to buy the "White Album" again was un-funny to me. Mostly I just got tired of Horrible Musicians wowing me with one song and having a disc full of @#%$ to go with it.  Sharing audio with people got me back into buying CDs.
<br />

<br />
The music industry has floated ultra high profits because of advances in information science.  There was no music industry before their were recordings. Recordings killed the sheet music industry.  And sheet music transformed music from the performance market that preceeded it.
<br />

<br />
Their current channel  is now dead.  They need to find new ways of selling their craft, the idea of selling copies of performances is now moot because of the same trends in advances that boosted their profits has made their channel obsolete.  This battle is about that industry coming to terms with that.<br />
