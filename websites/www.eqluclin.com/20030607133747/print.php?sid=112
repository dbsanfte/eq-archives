<br>
I'm considering running this due to the utter lack of quality entertainment lately by the GMs. If I get 8 or more teams willing to enter, the event will happen. I forgot to specify that this is for levels 60-65 only :P<br>
<br>
Rules and info below:<br>
(click submission title for rest of submission)<br />
Your team must consist of 6 people.<br>
- Entry fee is 3kpp per team.<br>
- Teams may contain no more than two of any specific class. Meaning no six paladin teams.<br>
- No restrictions on gear.<br>
- No form of movement acceleration other than the Run Speed AA will be allowed. This also applies to horses and bard song. Any team using movement acceleration spells or items will be disqualified.<br>
- No songs or spells which shadowstep another player will be allowed.<br>
- No fear type spells will be allowed.<br>
- Fighting will be confined at all times to the area of the platform. If any member of the team leaves the platform, that member will be disqualified, unless that member has gone LD. They will be required to remain outside the platform's boundary, and if they interfere with the match from that point forward they will be removed from the arena.<br>
- Matches will not be delayed to allow discipline timers to reset. If you choose to use a discipline, make sure you do it when you really, really need it.<br>
- The fights will begin with a 60 second buff period. After that, combat begins whether your team is ready or not. You will be fully dispelled before the buff period begins. Any casting while you're being dispelled results in disqualification.<br>
- While teams are fighting, anyone watching from the sidelines who attacks the teams or casts a spell will be removed from the arena. Since I'm not a GM and can't just summon you out, you'll get the choice of leaving on your own or being removed by force.<br>
<br>
Those are the rules in their entirety. If something is not prohibited above, it is allowable, so please don't ask me 8972387126397821 different questions.<br>
<br>
Respond to <a href="http://pub106.ezboard.com/fluclin71335general.showMessage?topicID=9445.topic">this post</a> only if you have a 6 man team that is willing to enter and can make it on the appointed day and time. 8 or more teams and it's happening.<br>
