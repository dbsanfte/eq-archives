Note: Some folks have had trouble getting the elves' beard colors to work properly. In order to get them to show up, you may need to set DoProperTinting=TRUE in your Eqclient.ini file. You can do that by typing /dopropertinting in game. <br>
<br>
ALSO NOTE: We have changed a lot of UI Files. Here's the list: <br>

<br>
<br>
** Interface and Gameplay ** <br>
<br>
- The melee button for Ulaks, Martial weapons and Two-Handed Piercing weapons should appear to be depressed when attacking. <br>
- Increased the size of the Notes window in the new UI. <br>
- /viewport fixed. <br>
- Fixed bug where action and hot-buttons for innate abilities would revert to numbers (1-6) instead of their name when a skin was loaded using /loadskin. It now reloads the names too. <br>
- Fixed a bug that could cause a client crash if too many full containers were open and the ALT key was pressed. <br>
<br>
<br>
** Spells ** <br>
<br>
- Lowered the mana cost of Yaulp I, Yaulp II, Yaulp III, and Yaulp IV to increase the value of these spells <br>
- Theft of Thought works properly now, it was draining all of the caster's mana, no matter who the target was. <br>
- Damage over Time type Area of Effect spells will no longer do damage when player character resists the spell. <br>
- All pet spells will now get focused from any pet focusing spell/item. This means, for example, that summoning haste will work on Beastlord and Necromancer pets. <br>
<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that caused pet health bar to disappear if when trying to charm when a pet already exists. <br>
- Divine Barrier now does all of its healing in a single burst instead of as regeneration. <br>
- Removed the erroneous message &quot;Returning to your own perspective&quot; that occurred when a character was changed into something using an illusion. <br>
<br>
<br>
** Quests ** <br>
<br>
- Dillon the Drowned should now respond properly when hailed. <br>
- Corrected a problem with a 'quest' for the hermit in South Karana. <br>
- Animist Poren now gives the correct recipe for his Handwraps Quest (shadeling silk instead of shade silk). <br>
- Noirin Khalen now gives out the proper jewelry book. <br>
- Supreme Loachsmith Psorin now returns items that he does not need or want. <br>
<br>
<br>
** Items ** <br>
<br>
- Removed Rogues from the list of classes on the Elegant Darkwood Katana, since it is a two-handed slashing weapon. <br>
- Removed the &quot;secondary&quot; tag from the Flametongue, as this item is for Int. casters only and they can't equip this item in their secondary slot. <br>
- The Nathsar Greatsword and Fester now have the proper inventory icon. <br>
<br>
<br>
** Tradeskills ** <br>
<br>
- Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman): Shadeweaver Portal. <br>
- Renamed one of two items called Figwort. The Figwort sold in Shar Vahl has been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion. <br>
- Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk. The Drachling Silk that was once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid Silk. <br>
- Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes. These great beasts are now much more likely to have their eye intact when killed. <br>
- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Soul of Incorporeal&quot; to use a &quot;feather&quot;. <br>
- Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Troll's Essence&quot;. <br>
- Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were inconsistent with their single dose versions. <br>
- General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he was having a problem crossing in the past. <br>
- Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of planar oak, Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable. <br>
- Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable. <br>
- Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents. <br>
- Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability. <br>
<br>
<br>
** Alternate Advancement ** <br>
<br>
- Extended Notes now works on area of Effect songs as well as group songs. <br>
<br>
<br>
** PvP ** <br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug with Root and Snare spells that prevented the target player character from being affected until they zoned. <br>
- Fixed a bug with mesmerization spells being unbreakable by normal means. <br>
<br>
<br>
** Zones ** <br>
<br>
- Fixed some text and grammar errors in Skyshrine. <br>
- Ikurenm the Sly should no longer disappear when trying to chase his enemies. <br>
- Repaired some &quot;safe spots&quot; in Echo Caverns, Paludal Caverns and Grieg's End. <br>
- Fixed a pathing issue in Kurn's Tower that was causing some NPCs to disappear. <br>
- The Golem Master in Charasis now looks like a golem. <br>
- The Orc Arsonist will no longer have his torch disappear when looted (as long as he had it to begin with). <br>
- The Sands of Fire event will now be restricted to the intended four groups. Alternate methods of getting characters into the event have been removed. <br>
- Corrected doors in Kaladim, Blackburrow and Erudin that opened the wrong way and one door in Kaesora that was way off its hinges. Also, the Dwarves have installed a door in one of their guard huts to prevent drafts. <br>
- Moved an oven in North Freeport that was poking through a ceiling. <br>
- Wraith of a Shissar should no longer attack its compatriots, so they should no longer be killing it in retaliation. <br>
- Corrected some respawn issues in the Plane of Air. <br>
- Rallos Zek is much less likely to need to leave the arena in order to deal with his enemies... <br>
<br>
<br>
** Miscellaneous ** <br>
<br>
- Changed &quot;wode&quot; to &quot;woad&quot; in the face picker. <br>
- Corrected a spelling error in the text of the Purify Body ability (affect to effect). <br>
- PCs under illusions should appear with hair if the race can have hair, even if the PC's race can't have hair. Fixed a few other bugs with illusions and their effect on hair and eyes. <br>
- Vah Shir will now see &quot;punches&quot; when punching instead of &quot;hits&quot;. <br />
