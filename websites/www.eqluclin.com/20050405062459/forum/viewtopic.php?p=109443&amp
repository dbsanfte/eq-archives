<br />
Copied for your pleasure:
<br />

<br />
With the launch of EverQuest in 1999, Sony Online Entertainment (back then we were Verant) was on the leading edge of what became a revolution in the video game business&#8230; Online Gaming. We certainly didn't invent it&#8230; in fact, we stood on the shoulders of some pretty amazing games, including Ultima Online&#8230; Meridian 59 and many, many other games including some great text MUDs.
<br />

<br />
EverQuest had that magic that propelled it to selling over 3 Million units over it's six year (well almost) lifespan. We've released 9 expansion packs during that time that have added an absolutely massive amount of content that we're pretty proud of. Certainly some of those expansions were better than others, but I think our goal has always been the same&#8230; to entertain our players.
<br />

<br />
With the launch of EverQuest II, our goal was to refine EverQuest&#8230; to distill the things that made EverQuest great, but also to add its own flavor and gameplay style. I think it's fair to say we also needed to aim for a more casual gamer&#8230; and make the game appeal to people that may not have the same amount of time they had when EverQuest first came out. As a company we needed to also appeal to a wider base of people. I think you can see from the universal appeal of the Lord of the Rings books (and oh yeah, the movies too&#8230;) fantasy worlds are what we can all call "mass market". I'm really proud of EverQuest II and I honestly believe we delivered on our goals of making an incredibly fun and immersive world that our players want to be a part of and make their own.
<br />

<br />
Over the years, we've learned a lot. The biggest thing we've learned is that our players care very much about everything we do and the changes we make to their world. I cannot tell you how many thousands of emails I've gotten over the years complaining about class balance, nerfs, and overall changes we've made to the game. While I can absolutely understand and respect where each and every one of the people that took the time to write these passionate emails came from (and I read every single one of them and do my best to respond to them as well), I can also assure you that our game teams really do care about the changes they make. Remember... YOU, our players, write our paychecks.
<br />

<br />
But it's more than that.
<br />

<br />
It's also about truly caring about what we do. The vast majority of our development teams come from our playerbase. That's a fact that I'm incredibly proud of. In fact, it may surprise you to know that EverQuest actually was the catalyst for one of our Executive Team members to meet his wife (he just got married within the last 6 months)&#8230; she was in his guild&#8230; one thing led to another and&#8230; well the rest is as they say history.
<br />

<br />
We've certainly made our share of mistakes over the years&#8230; but overall, we've tried to stay true to our primary goal of entertaining you.
<br />

<br />
That's our job description.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Now what's been interesting from our perspective is what really serious competition is doing to the online gaming space. World of Warcraft has come on the scene and is doing awesome. Kudos to Blizzard on what I think is a spectacular game. I've played the heck out of it, and I love it (as have many people here at SOE). To a game developer, having another game developer play your game is the ultimate compliment&#8230; so to the folks at Blizzard we say "Nicely done".
<br />

<br />
But don't think for a second that we don't see WoW as both a great game AND Blizzard as serious competition.</span>
<br />

<br />
Personally&#8230; I'm glad they are out there. They keep us honest. They keep us focused and they force us to play with our 'A' game. They've certainly opened some eyes in our company to styles of gameplay that are different than we would have come up with inside SOE. I hope they're also opening up the eyes of other MMO developers that the 'old school' probably won't cut it any more. I'm glad that we went in the direction we did with EQ II because had we stuck with making an even "harder core" game, I think bad things would have happened. We need to be about larger scale mass-entertainment&#8230; because that's what online gaming is slowly becoming. Our games just need to be fun&#8230; and easy to get into.
<br />

<br />
In the United States there are around 2 Million paying online gamers (this is after WoW btw). That's up from 250,000 back before EverQuest was released... and I'm only counting the MMO's.. if you start to add in the Pogo's of the world we're probably talking about 3-4 Million online gamers... and I have no idea what scary numbers some of these online poker places are bringing in.
<br />

<br />
What this means is that making future online games is a big business that is going to be increasingly competitive. I think that's good for you, and good for us. It's going to insure great games get made&#8230; and I can tell you we're in this for the long haul.
<br />

<br />
Where are we going? What are we going to be doing to revolutionize this business? Well let me throw out just a few of the things we're thinking about here at SOE.
<br />

<br />
What if you could have families in MMO's? Virtual Children&#8230; What if your characters could have children and pass on the family name&#8230;
<br />

<br />
What if players could build fantastic dungeons that become part of the worlds we create with tools we give them? How would that work exactly?
<br />

<br />
Can MMORPGs have skill based combat?
<br />

<br />
What if?
<br />

<br />
I mention these things to be provocative. I want to make sure we're going to take what we do to the next level&#8230; and that's going to mean putting some next generation ideas out there and seeing the kinds of things you actually want&#8230; but I at least want to start this dialogue and stir the pot a little. We're very interested in your ideas about where things go from here.

And thats bad how? I don't like playing with 23540928340234892092304 complete idiots in WoW. Pick up groups are suicide. I end up yelling at people and kicking them out of group after 5 minutes because they just don't cut it. If you don't know how to play a game after hitting level 40, I'm sorry - there is NO hope for you. Quit - delete,  you are worthless get off my server for the love of god and go play somewhere else, or go play online poker/scrabble since it seems to be more your speed.
<br />

<br />
Vanguard, if they stick true to form with no instancing, etc... an O.G EQ feel - I'll be playing that, with 500 other people on the server, and you know what? I'll know everyone's name, whenever so and so got that elite sword that you only hear about, who killed what first and why... it'll be nice to have that again.
<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong WOW is a great game, but its designed to appeal to the masses, while Vanguard isn't. Brad has a vision in his head as to what a real game should be for real game players. WoW is alot of fun! And thats what it is supposed to be. But there is no sacrifice, no risk really, but there is some great PVP and griefing to be had <img src="images/smiles/wink.gif" alt="wink" border="0" />. WoW isn't exactly what I wanted, but it is a damned good game, by far the best the market has to offer right now.<br />

				That style would be just fine with me.  I liked it in EQ and will be fine with it in another game.  My only fear is I believe M$ is the publisher for Sigil, and as such they might try to push their hand too much and try to turn Vanguard into another watered-down-for-the-masses RPG.  But Brad has demonstrated before he's willing to put up a fight to protect his vision, and I don't doubt he'll do it again.
<br />

<br />
Microsoft cancelled a couple of their other MMRPG projects but let this one continue.  Hopefully they realize that the best thing they can do for the game is to stay the hell out of it.<br />

Casuals and hardcores are not exclusives.
<br />

<br />
All you need to do is make the casuals rule the casuals zone unless the non-casuals farm it as well.
<br />

<br />
But if to be equal to the casuals in Crushbone you need to hunt there 2 days and leave Papazol to beat you unquestionnably in the high end area, we both know you will lack in Crushbone and competing with Papazol.  Althought I wont be competing per say, I would work more there then in Crushbone.<br />

				Deris raises some good points.  And I agree about most of those things that we used to appreciate about EQ.
<br />

<br />
In EQ we definitely had much more of a sense of community than I have seen in WoW so far (granted the game is still young).  And I think there was a bit more quality over quantity.  In WoW there are just a lot more indistinct faces in the crowd, and it's a large crowd.
<br />

<br />
But there are tradeoffs.  Most of which I'm happy about in WoW.  EQ sucked for pvp (it was nothing more than an afterthought, I know, but it was stupidly frustrating and pointless trying to ever duel or pvp as a caster most of the time).  WoW player combat is something that overall I'm very pleased with.  It's not perfect and I'm not even going to get into the honor system, but I think it's fairly friendly in terms of being more effective with a wider level range and how useful classes are.
<br />

<br />
And also where in EQ it took me what, 2+ years to get to level 60, I can make that inside of 3 months in WoW without making myself miserable at times to do so.  It's a lot more friendly as far as time commitment goes.  EQ owned if you wanted to progress, especially in the high end.<br />
