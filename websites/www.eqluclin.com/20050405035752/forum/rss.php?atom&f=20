	I just bought an XFX 6600gt AGP 128mb card and I had 3d graphics working on it yesterday.  While messing with the settings in WoW, the shader settings I checked the death setting.  Well about 3 seconds after that it locked up and I had to reset my comp.  Now I cant get 3d to work on anything.  3dbenchmark locks up about 3 seconds into its test as well.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Did I fry my card somehow?
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Also I deleted the WTF directory in WoW.  I was told that should reset my graphics options to default.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;- Yunus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	You would be suprised what IT Admins look for and look at on client systems.  I am the admin for the proxy and NAV servers here in my own little corner of HP hell and there are several places where red flags are raised and I start snooping.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
You hit a site with a bloodhound exploit?  Even if NAV blocks it, its logged on the server and flags your PC in the console.  Most work related sites do not have bloodhound exploits built into them, thats a BIG red flag.  I browse to the possible offender's temp internet files and take a gander.  Even if they purge their temp files, I can still search the proxy logs by user name, machine name, or IP address.  
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Its really, really hard to hide what you are doing with all the reporting tools available in today's corporate world.  In short, if you arent willing to lose your job over your surfing habits, keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;---

&lt;br /&gt;
Short answer? No.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Their property, their computers, their network, all time you spend there is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;their time,&lt;/span&gt; not yours. They &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;own&lt;/span&gt; you, in a very real, legally binding sense. There have been lawsuits where employees have lost rights to the intellectual property they have created because it was done on company time. I even read one case where it was an employee's hobby project, done on his own time at home, but his employer was still able to take posession of it because his employment contract went so far as to claim ownership of everything he creates while employed. Some contracts stop just short of claiming they own your thoughts. I'd be willing to bet there are government and military contracts that don't stop there.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This is why you very carefully read your employment contract and all company policy before signing anything. You'll find the computer use policy typically revokes any kind of privacy right you think you have. This is all perfectly legal; if you don't agree with it, you can always refuse to sign. Signature is consent, and waives your rights.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6290&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/images/smiles/protest.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	As an IT manager are you allowed to view an employee's desktop just at random or do you have to suspect something shady is being done?  The AF does not allow our regular IT guys to do this.  It takes a Network operations center officer/SNCO to remote view.  This is for privacy concerns with the possibility of sensitive emails being open and viewed.

	Aye. One of my favorite IT t-shirts bears the phrase, &quot;Go away, or I shall replace you with a small shell script.&quot; That's actually no joke. Typically a lot of the detection logic is scripted and built in to the proxy server. There are companies that make money selling products and security scripts for exactly this purpose. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Even if you evade the script's logic, there's always random monitoring. Some IT shops set up policies so that every employee is monitored once every couple of months. The number of people isn't important; the computer processes that data to make reports, not the administrator. It's the number of company sites and number of external connections that makes it harder. 4000 people at one site is barely harder than 1000 people at one site.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Also, don't make the assumption that the security department is as incompetent as the rest of the IT department. Usually, security is the most competent of them all, and you never see them, so you've no idea they are there, and you tend to assume they are just part of the IT group. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Your best hope to go unnoticed is that their network is largely fragmented, made up of many seperate departments with their own domains and security models, and even their own internet connections. The more decentralized and disorganized it becomes, the harder it is to track user activity. Size and density aren't as much of an issue as disorganization and decentralization.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Most companies won't give @#%$ about a low bandwidth ssh connection to a shell at home. If you want to surf at work, chat, manage torrent downloads etc, your best bet is a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic&quot;&gt;text only&lt;/span&gt; terminal session to home, with no tunneling. Unless they are screenshotting you, they aren't likely to notice that. Learn to love a command line.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6290&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/images/smiles/protest.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Who says they are actively monitoring it?  I can't write them, but I have seen some MEAN scripts to monitor different types of traffic, complete with session records and alerts based on whatever triggers are set up.  One I can remember pretty well was some guy who had a transparent proxy set up on their network, and was picking users at random and had x output to a browser window a mirror of what they were surfing.
&lt;br /&gt;

Big Brother is watching a lot closer than you might think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	That was pretty informative Raviel, thanks.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I don't know any of our IT people, heck they are in a different building.  This place I work at is a campus, I have ~4,000 co-workers.  You mentioned places like Xerox and Kodiak, well this is a multi-billion dollar company I am working at.  Would rather not mention a name right now, but they are a Fortune 100 company.   I would think and hope that the IT people have better things to do than monitor traffic that could be coming to the PC in one of my labs.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Anyhow I have no clue what type of proxy server they use or how the network is set up.  I know they are not too anal about things (hence why I am able to get on the net to begin with), but they do lock out certain websites.  For instance I was reading Google News about the Sony PSP and when I tried to click links it was being blocked, and I imagine due to keywords like &quot;games.&quot;  Most other news websites, though, are not blocked.  Honestly I can't blame a company for blocking out gaming websites, even if it is just info.  I was, though, able to come to this forum without any issue.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I suppose it is just the inquisitive science person in me.  Often when I meet new things, such as this proxy server stuff, I get curious about it and start poking my nose around.  I may install that SmoothWall stuff on my home PC network just for kicks to see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=460030&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue&quot;&gt;Xianin Shakezula&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	Network administrators can, frankly, lock down everything to the point where there is no way you can get around it. The good ole days are long gone, at least if the admin is worth his salt. There are precious few things he can't outright prevent, and he can easily detect you doing the things he can't prevent you from doing. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Essentially, a web proxy is a machine running special proxy software, such as the squid proxy server, or Microsoft's Internet (in)Security Server. (As far as I know, Squid is the best one on the market, and it's GPL.) The web browsers on your machine are configured to send their requests for web pages off to this proxy server, which then does the actual connecting and downloading of the website itself, and passes the results back to your web browser. Direct access to the internet in this situation is usually forbidden by the company's firewalls, and there's no way around that. Typically only the proxy server itself is allowed to access the internet. Large organizations like Xerox and Kodak (to name two I know for certain) typically set up their networks this way.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Proxies provide a number of advantages. One of the big ones is caching. Squid can maintain multi-terabyte caches of data, saving the trouble of going out to the internet again to download that same data over and over, much like your web browser's own cache, but on a company site-wide scale. It can really ease up the load on your internet connection.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The main reason they use it for corporate security is because the proxy can keep the kind of logs on your websurfing behaviour that give Orwell nightmares. Every minute activity of the user is logged in excruciating detail, giving them the ability to profile all aspects of a user's web surfing.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Proxies can be configured to request usernames and passwords before allowing access for further security. They can be set up to grant or deny access to certain protocols (http, https, ftp, etc) or websites based on those credentials. Commercial (and even some free) proxy servers also have modules that can be activated that block pages with dirty words, a certain amount of skin tone content in images, or ones that are on a list of blocked sites. They can cut out images, change the data on the page coming back to you... anything really. It's an easy way to launder your websurfing data before it gets back to the end user. Highly advanced servers can be configured to block and alert or filter based on literally any context that can be expressed mathematically. They can be far more complicated than firewalls.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
(Typically, an overly-draconian proxy configuration is a sign of massively paranoid management or administration, and not a good thing... it means you probably work in dilbertland.)
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The most typical are the kind you don't even know you are using, called transparent proxies. Typically these are part of your company's gateway/firewall configuration. All web traffic is analyzed as it travels across the firewall, and no special configuration is needed on your workstation. The firewall is already proxying all of your internet traffic for you; that's its job, using NAT translation. It's trivial to add proxy features to a firewall since it's already doing it, so that's what they did, and most commercial firewalls have powerful proxy capabilities.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
If your internal work network matches 192.168.xxx.xxx, or 10.xxx.xxx.xxx, you're definitely using one (those are private, non-routable, meaning they can't be used on the internet). Also, if you are using 192.168.xxx.xxx, your administrator needs a boot to the head for being an idiot. Those conflict with home networks all the time... if you use 192.168.1.xxx at home, and 192.168.1.xxx at work, you can't bridge or tunnel those two networks together. It's like having the same phone number at two houses; the router can't figure out where to send the data.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Proxies are an excellent type of software that is, unfortunately, usually used to draconian ends in IT shops as an easy, invisible method of invading a user's privacy (not that they technically have any while at work, but that's a computer ethics discussion and a topic for another thread).
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
If you know you are going through a proxy, you should NEVER be typing any passwords. Ever. The proxy can easily record them, and now that pimply-faced net admin has your bank account information. Lovely.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A popular tactic of spyware is to hijack your internet connection, then redirect (proxy) all of your internet traffic either through a remote host owned by the spyware company, or through a local proxy set up by the spyware program itself. This is to record your surfing habits and security-sensitive information. Typically you can tell when this happens, because things stop displaying properly and slow down dramatically (some proxy software can wreak havoc with high-tech pages that are highly dynamic).
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
***
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
There's another kind of proxy server that is much more interesting. Reverse-proxies are the same software, but applied in reverse, so that the proxy server is sitting directly in front of the webserver the internet users are trying to access. This is a good way of handling heavy loads that tend to hit the same pages over and over. It's how heavy-load sites can handle thousands of hits per second. For example, Wikipedia uses a squid cluster in front of their web servers (their architectire is internet-proxy-web-database). This means when an article becomes suddenly very popular (a flash crowd like the slashdot effect), the load hits the proxy servers in the front who can keep serving it from their cache, saving the webservers the hassle of re-rendering the page for every new visitor.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Wikipedia is kind enough to make all of their configuration (and analysis pages) publically accessible, so if you want a good real world example you can take a look at them &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; There's a snapshot of their cluster architecture &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikimedia-servers-2005-01-30.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; Their alexa rank is 126 this week... at this rate, they'll be more popular and more visited than eBay in a few months. That's several hundred hits per second, all day, every day. All thanks to reverse proxies. Their statistics say Squid is handling 78% of all traffic, and nearly 100% from media spikes.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
All that said, essentially the network administrator can wreak havoc with you and do whatever he wants. There is only one way to get around this, and that is through tunneling. Tunneling is essentially creating a pipeline over the existing network (on whatever port you desire), and creating a virtual network of sorts over that tunnel. The best example of this is VPN.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to get around anything your network administrators do, the easiest way is to use software like &lt;a href=&quot;http://openvpn.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt; to create a private tunnel from your network at work to your network at home. Essentially, you can proxy all of your internet traffic that you don't want work to see back off to your home computer to be redirected back out onto the internet (it's more complex than that under the hood, but that's essentially what it is doing). Also, VPN tunnels are typically encrypted, meaning that while the administrator of your work network can see them coming from your work PC and going off elsewhere, he cannot see the data inside... all he can see is the destination.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
You can make this connection as long as you can get out to the internet in any way. If necessary, you can tunnel your entire network over a web connection going from your work computer to your home computer. The only downside to doing this is that, if they check the logs, it'll undoubtedly show up as a large spike of your web traffic going to one host, and an alert administrator will notice that. An expert one will suspect it's tunneling. Typically that sort of thing is forbidden by your company's computer use policy and doing it can get you in hot water if they find out.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Where I work, we use a transparent proxy. Esentially, the firewall/router is doing the proxy work itself, so there's no need to set up a seperate proxy server in the company and go to the work of configuring all the machines to use it. We don't do any real monitoring; our users are allowed to browse anything they damn well please from their desks so long as it doesn't choke up the internet when we're trying to get work done (like downloading 5 800MB ISO images during business hours). The only filtering the firewall does is to check the URLs for attacks and vulnerabilities (basically, funky URLs get dropped by the firewall as being a security risk). This breaks some sites that use fagtastic web code (Yahoo and eBay, to name a few.) We don't care. &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/images/smiles/wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;wink&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
While we don't mind users surf whatever they want (including porn... don't ask don't tell is the policy), we do take issue with tunneling. The problem is that the tunnel works both ways, and if your home network is polluted with viruses and spyware and other crap, your little tunnel is a great backdoor for it to get into our corporate network right past all of our internet-facing defenses. Things like the SQL Slammer worm can infect your work PC from your home network, and then our intrusion detection systems pick up the attacks coming from your work PC, shut it down, and you get a nasty phone call from us. For this reason, VPNs and tunnels are watched for here like a hawk. We allow a couple people who know @#%$ (like me, the firewall admin, and one or two users) to do it, but block it for most others.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
There are ways to secure all this and control the traffic flow over the tunnels to minimize risks, but they are non trivial, and if you can do them you are at the skill level of a professional network administrator. There are no point-click interfaces for doing this easily; it is not for non-techies... at least, not yet. Someday. Linksys cable routers are the first attempt at a non-techie solution to this sort of thing, and frankly, they suck %@$#, especially for anything as advanced as tunnelling.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
***
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
There are two linux distributions designed for this sort of thing for your use at home, if you are interested. They come with builtin firewalls, pretty web interfaces similar to linksys for configuration, as well as proxy servers, dhcp/dns servers, security, and a bunch of other bells and whistles. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The first (and my favorite for home use) is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smoothwall.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;Smoothwall.&lt;/a&gt; It uses a simple color scheme and drastically simplified rules that make firewall management a cakewalk (red for internet, orange for DMZ (protected servers), green for your home network, blue for wireless, you get the idea). There's also a great forum and user community, and literally dozens of homebrew hacks to add functionality. It's a great firewall for learning. If you use this thing you can rest easy as far as security... the only people who can possibly hack you through it have far better things to do with their time than worry about you.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
That said, it is only great if you use it for what it was designed for... connecting a home network to the internet. There's a truckload of logic in it that makes you very secure, but prevents you from adapting it to more general purposes (such as connecting safe corporate network segments together). It is not intended as a fully-configurable, general purpose firewall. There's a smoothwall corporate version (pay-for) for that. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Smoothie is free, GPLed. The commercial version has a truckload more features (most of which are duplicated in the homebrew modules to some degree) but is a pay-for product. Smoothwall Limited does go out of their way to support the free version, however. They are very active on their forums helping people out.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
If that's what you need... if you want something more configurable and more sophisticated, you can play with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mandrakesoft.com/products/mnf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;Mandrake's Multi-Network Firewall.&lt;/a&gt; I hate mandrake linux, but they make a damn sensible firewall, one that works like the real thing and supports very complex rules. There's also no default logic in it, so it won't do things you aren't aware of; it'll only do what you tell it to do. They've got a damn fine user manual, but firewall familiarity is assumed. MNF logs far better than Smoothwall, and is much more precise. MNF is included in every Mandrake Linux distribution... simply elect to install the &quot;very minimal system&quot;, then the &quot;httpd-naat&quot; and &quot;mnf&quot; packages. From there the manual will get you set up.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Happy hacking. Yes, I was bored, and had an hour to kill. Time to go home.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/images/smiles/razz.gif&quot; alt=&quot;razz&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;

Because ssh is an encrypted protocol nobody is going to have a clue what you are doing from analyzing the traffic - other than knowing you have a reasonable amount of traffic on port 22 (or whatever port you configure SSH to listen on).&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;postbody&quot;&gt;

Because ssh is an encrypted protocol nobody is going to have a clue what you are doing from analyzing the traffic - other than knowing you have a reasonable amount of traffic on port 22 (or whatever port you configure SSH to listen on).&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;Dread Lord Gobb 65 SK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	ok i googled up &quot;.nrg files&quot;, and found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200312/1071225077.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;. Seems a .nrg file is akin to an ISO file, which can be easily extracted (like .zip files) via &lt;a href=&quot;http://flashtrax.ca/wrar340.exe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot;&gt;WinRAR&lt;/a&gt;. Whether or not .nrg files work with WinRAR, i don't know, but it's worth a shot. Most likely, your movie file is inside the .nrg file.&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;/lurking since the year 2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	Ok I dl some movie which unfortunately was converted to a .nrg file. It says it's a Nero Backup Img file but when I try to burn, open or anything Nero says this is not a valid Nero Image File.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone know of a proggy that I can use to convert this file to a watchable vid (avi, wma etc...)????
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Any help appreciated.
&lt;br /&gt;

	Be very careful with proxy traffic, they can watch for it, and you will get your %@$# busted faster than if you were visiting sites normally. Especially if it's encrypted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

	Your BIOS is seeing it as a 33GB drive?
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Check your drive's jumper settings.  You may have turned on the 32GB clip option many drives come with.  Also check your BIOS's seettings for the drive.  You may have LBA turned off.  You may also have a buggy BIOS or attached it to a controller that does not play well with the drive.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Which Gentoo version are you using and what kernel (2.6 is too broad) is it booting with.  Is it 2005.1?  I could do a lot more for ya if you would dump the dmesg into a post.  Gentoo install comes with an ssh server that you can start up and you can scp files to another machine in a network if you dont wanna bother with links.  I'm sure you know that:
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
#dmesg &amp;gt; ~/postme.txt
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Will let you save it and fetch it easily.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Alternately you could just putty in and dmesg to your terminal and copy and paste from there...
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Troubleshooting hardware without the kernel's output is really tough.  There is a chance that the output from lspci may be useful too &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.eqluclin.com/forum/images/smiles/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;smile&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;If voting could change the system, it would be illegal.

	fdisk and cfdisk both show it fat32 as 33 gigs.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I went into my BIOS and looked at my hard drive... it's showing the size as 33 gigs.  I have a newer motherboard that really shouldn't have any problem at all supporting large drives...
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
What i CAN do is I can use the SuSE installer and mount the two drives (which it sees perfectly.  2 80 gig drives, Fat32 LBA mounted to /mnt/disk1 and disk 2 respectively (yes i come up with some creative names)) during install.  I fire up SuSE and boom, there're my drives.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
How do I do that with gentoo?&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;Transcendent of Cabilis -- LoS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
