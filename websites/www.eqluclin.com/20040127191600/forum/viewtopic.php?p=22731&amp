Cayleu is correct to a certain level regarding the return of Jewish people to Israel/Palestine. It started with the Zionist movement in 1892.  One fact I am unclear of was whether or not there were any Jewish people left in these lands before this time.  I know they were exiled at least by the Romans after Masada, and I think a few other attempts to resettle in the region were made.  Seems to be a pretty large hole in history from what I've been able to find out.<span class="gensmall"></span>

Get a few facts straight.
<br />

<br />
The UN (actually, the British, who had the place after WWII) did not GIVE the jews anything.  Jews moved to a desert that no one wanted and no country claimed and BOUGHT the land, paying outrageous prices in most cases.  It was a Zionist movement to reestablish Israel, and it worked.  On the contrary, the British, and then the UN, did their best to block jewish immigration, and the formation of Israel.
<br />

<br />
THERE NEVER WAS A PALASTINE!  No such organized country has ever existed.  The term has been used to identify a geographc area, but was never a country, people, or government.  The concept of a Palastinian nation is recent, within the last decade or two, and is a blatent copying of the Zionist movement, which movement "Palastinians" deplore, lol.
<br />

<br />
While no person, nation, or cause is perfect, there is clearly a good guy and a bad guy in this conflict.
<br />

<br />
No! No! No!
<br />

<br />
Let's correct a few facts.  The UN did not do it because "wow" there was no UN yet!  It was an act of the League of Nations!  According to Microsoft (cos it's too late for me to quote from something really serious)
<br />
</span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr>	<tr>	  <td class="quote">In July 1922 the League of Nations, an alliance of world powers formed in 1920 to preserve peace, issued a mandate granting control over Palestine to Britain, entrusting it to facilitate the establishment of a Jewish national home. Encouraged by British support of the Zionist cause, waves of Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine between 1919 and 1939, each contributing to the developing Jewish community (Yishuv). </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
<br />

<br />
Palestine was not a country, it was a manditated area.  It had rules etc. written down by England. The first and most important set written in 1917 (Balfour Declaration).  This was AFTER 35,000+ Jews had already settled there, starting in the late 1800's.  Way before the dates of 1919 you give.   In many ways it was a soverign nation. It even had its own governments, one for the Arabs and an assembly run by the Jewish settlers.  So as you can see, the idea of the Arabs having their own government is not within the last couple decades, but goes back to 1939.
<br />

<br />

<br />
To correct another error, England turned it over right after WWII - they had it since WWI not WWII.  
<br />

<br />
Early on, Britain did a little to keep the Jewish population down, but not as much as you claim.  And what little they did was to provent infighting with the Arabs over land.  It was not until 1939 that Britain issued a serious policy statement discouraging Jews from settling.  This is because there had been turmoil for the last 15 years between the Jews and Arabs and a full revolt in 1936-39 by the Arabs who wanted thier land back and the newly relocated Jews out.
<br />

<br />
If the British were so very against this idea of Palestine, why did they mandate it?  And yes, both England and the UN wanted to form a country out of part of Palestine. In fact, they even formed a special committee to make sure the problem would be taken care of by the time the British mandate ended in 1948.  The Arabs refused to accept the UN decision.    
<br />
From then on the situation becomes similar to that of Northern Ireland.  I once heard Bernadette Devlin speak and what she said was very revelant to this part of the world as well as her home.<span class="gensmall"></span>

<br />

<br />
The Ottoman Empire ruled Jerusalem and the surrounding territory from about 1517 to 1917.  Zionism began a movement of Jews towards Jerusalem including purchasing land during this time.  This movement dates to the late 19th century...including one specific reference to 1897 ( <a href="http://www.zionist.com/zionism/series/zionism3.htm" target="_blank">http://www.zionist.com/zionism/series/zionism3.htm</a> ).  It started as a movement to establish a national homeland for Jews on historic Israel.  It was based on a tract by Theodor Herzl called "A Jewish State" proposing a national homeland as a solution to oppression and persecution against Jews worldwide.  This was during the time of Ottoman control of "Palestine."
<br />

<br />
Britain militarily occupied the "Palestine" as a consequence of the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1917.  The Balfour Declaration was signed in 1917 BEFORE the establishment of the British Mandate.  The Balfour Declaration can be found at this site ( <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/balfour.htm" target="_blank">http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/balfour.htm</a> ) and demonstrates British government support for Jewish Zionisht aspirations for a national homeland IN "Palestine."
<br />

<br />

<br />
In 1920, Britain was given the responsibility of administering Palestine via the British Mandate of the League of Nations and a civil administration took over from the military.  The Mandate included
<br />
1.  What is now Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank
<br />
2.  The Golan Heights, ceded to the French Protectorate of Syria in 1922.
<br />
3.  What became Trans-Jordan and is now Jordan.  "Trans-Jordan" meant across the Jordan River from the main portion of Palestine.  It was separated from "Palestine" in 1921.
<br />
The mandate called for the mandatory authority to establish a Jewish homeland in "Palestine"
<br />
( <a href="http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_mandate_overview.php" target="_blank">http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_mandate_overview.php</a> and <a href="http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_ww1_british_mandate.php" target="_blank">http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_ww1_british_mandate.php</a> )
<br />

<br />
After the conclusion of World War 2, the British sought to leave Palestine and ceded to the United Nations the responsibility of determining how to resolve Jewish v. Arab interests.  The UN established a plan for partitioning Palestine and issued UN General Assembly Resolution 181 in 1947 that created intended boundaries for Jewish and Arab states.  The plan gave the northern coastal region, Eastern Galilee (surround the Sea of Galilee), and the Negev desert to the Jewish state.  The rest was planned for the "Palestinian" (aka Arab) state.   The proportion was approximately 55% Jewish and 45% Arab.  ( <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Palestine" target="_blank">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_Palestine</a> )
<br />

<br />
The Jews accepted the plan although they had reservations regarding security.  The Arabs rejected the plan and requested other Arab states to join them in a war for political control over the entire region.  This war occurred in 1948 and resulted in what was then called the "Green Line" (and we call the "pre-1967" borders) via an armistice in 1949.  Israel gained about 50% more land and ended up with approximately 70% of the land area.  Egypt occupied Gaza and Jordan occupied the West Bank to prevent Israeli control over those territories.  I've included the wiki pages because they give a good perspective and seem relatively "balanced".

<br />

<br />
The next major altercation surrounded Egyptian nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956.  The canal was built by a joint Egyptian/French effort from 1859-1869 with the intention that it would be jointly administered for 99 years and then revert to Egyptian control.  Britain purchased the Egyptian stocks (portion) in 1875.  Britain gained by treaty the right to station military forces on the canal in 1936.  In 1954 Egypt and Britian agreed to a force reduction plan that would turn the canal over to Egypt by 1961.  In 1956 Nasser short-circuited that plan by nationalizing the canal.  France and Britain joined forces attacking Nasser and Nasser responded by sinking 40 vessels that were on the canal at that time.  France and Britain secretly conspired to have Israel also attack Egypt.  The US and the Soviet Union step in to stop the war.

<br />

<br />
Fatah (al Fatah means "the victory") was founded by Yasser Arafat in 1957 in the aftermath of the war for the Suez Canal.  The group's purpose was full independence for "Palestinian" Arabs.  Fatah later joined the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1968 in the aftermath from the 1967 Six Day War.
<br />
( <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fateh" target="_blank">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fateh</a> )
<br />

<br />
The Palestinian Liberation Organization was formed in 1964 as an umbrella organization to unify and coordinate various groups opposed to Israeli control of "Palestine".   The Palestinian Liberation Army was the military wing and was established in Gaza until 1967.  The listed site suggests Arafat collaboration/leadership of the PLA.

<br />
The Six Day War is a very intricate subject that deserves an extensive treatment.  If any one nation were to blame for the start of the war, it would probably be the Soviet Union.  They essentially passed questionable (if not intentionally false) intelligence to Egypt and Syria suggesting that Israel was about to attack.  This led to an amassing of forces by both which led Israel to strike pre-emptively.  This pre-emptive strike destroyed the majority of Egyptian and Syrian air power.  Israel then conquered Jerusalem, all of the West Bank (from Jordan), Gaza and the Sinai Desert (from Egypt).  They also pushed into and took control of the Golan Heights from Syria.  Egypt, Jordan, and Syria also received aid from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Sudan, and Algeria.  At the end of the Six Day War Israeli troops were less than 100 km from the capitals of Egypt (Cairo), Syria (Damascus), and Jordan (Amman).  Egypt also closed the Suez Canal due to Israel proximity to the Canal (and in part to punish Western supporters of Israel.)  Finally, the PLO/PLA moved to Jordan after Israel conquered Gaza.

<br />

<br />
In 1969 Yasser Arafat assumed control of the united PLO.  He made an attempt to futher unite a collection of pro-Palestinian militant organizations based in Jordan.  King Hussein (OF JORDAN) accomodated the militants at first, but as time progressed his primary political struggle became maintaining control over his own nation.  To make a long story short (read the link for more details), Hussein went to war with the PLO and kicked them out in the Black September action of 1970.  One historical note was those of us who remember the term 'fedayeen' associate it first with the PLO/militants fighting against the Husseini government forces.

<br />

<br />

<br />
Next was the Yom Kippur/Ramadan War in 1973.  This was a surprise attack by the Arabs, led by Egypt and Syria (supported by Jordan and Iraq, financed by Saudi Arabia), to reverse the humiliation of the 1967 defeat.  Israel was caught unprepared and lost some of its occupied territory, particularly in the Sinai.  The UN brokered ceasefires with Syria and Egypt.  Egypt regained control of both sides of the Suez Cana.  Western supporters were punished by the beginning of the oil embargo by OPEC nations in 1973 following conclusion of hostilities.  Israel positioned military units to support Jordan in case of extensive military intervention by Iraq and Syria in support of the PLO.

<br />
Israel invaded and occupied Lebanon in 1982 to pursue PLO guerillas.  The PLO eventually agreed to withdraw from Lebanon to Tunis, Tunisia.  Iran/Syria-backed Hizbullah then took up arms against Israel in an attempt to force Israel out of Syrian-"managed" Lebanon.  Israel unilaterally withdrew from Lebanon in 2000.  The link I'm providing gives some of the details and hints at the broader Civil War for Lebanon that was occuring at this time.  That war deserves separate research by informed readers.

The two intifadas occurred between 1987 to 1993 and the more bloody one from 2000-the present.  Since we see the results of the second one in the news, I'm not going into details on this.

				<td colspan="2"><div class="postbody">You might be surprised by my answer on this.  In spite of overwhelming force from the Arabs, Israel established and has maintained a state since 1949.  They have conquered and administered the West Bank and Gaza.  This historical event is fact.
<br />

<br />
A fact prophesied by the Tanak among the prophecies of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and the "minor" prophets.  That prophecy includes the gathering of Jews from all parts of the world...including unlikely places like Cush (present-day Ethiopia).
<br />

<br />
There is no other nation that has literally been reformed from all parts of the world back into its original geographic region ever.  That hints at something invisible going on.
<br />

<br />
I do not believe that the present day Israelis own the moral high ground, however.  They have used every ploy possible to frustrate the ambitions of the Palestinian Arabs...and the surrounding Arabs in turn.  They have created what can only be viewed as a deep, abiding enmity with their closest geographical neighbors.  It wasn't surprising, therefore, that Israel has put out feelers for joining the European Union...because it is difficult to imagine normal relations between Israel and Syria, Saudi Arabia, or even US-backed Iraq.  BUT...the peace with Egypt and with Jordan still holds.
<br />

<br />
There is more eschatology that I could discuss here, but I suspect that attempting to discuss it isn't worth the ridicule...so I won't.  Just something to consider.

On April 23, Bob read this list of overlooked facts in the current Middle East situation.  These were complied by a Christian University professor. 
<br />
1. Nationhood and Jerusalem. Israel became a nation in 1312 B.C.E., two thousand years before the rise of Islam.
<br />

<br />
2. Arab refugees in Israel began identifying themselves as a part of the Palestinian people in 1967, two decades after the establishment of the modern state of Israel.
<br />

<br />
3. Since the Jewish conquest in 1272 B.C.E., the Jews have had dominion over the land for one thousand years with a continuous presence in the land for the past 3,300 years. 
<br />

<br />
4. The only Arab dominion since the conquest in 635 C.E. lasted no more than 22 years. 
<br />

<br />
5. For over 3,300 years, Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital. Jerusalem has never been the capital of any Arab or Muslim entity. Even when the Jordanians occupied Jerusalem, they never sought to make it their capital, and Arab leaders did not come to visit.
<br />

<br />
6. Jerusalem is mentioned over 700 times in Tanach, the Jewish Holy Scriptures. Jerusalem is not mentioned in the Koran.
<br />

<br />
7. King David founded the city of Jerusalem. Mohammed never came to Jerusalem.
<br />

<br />
8. Jews pray facing Jerusalem. Muslims pray with their backs toward Jerusalem. 
<br />

<br />
9. Arab and Jewish Refugees: In 1948 the Arab refugees were encouraged to leave Israel by Arab leaders promising to purge the land of Jews. Sixty-eight percent left without ever seeing and Israeli soldier.
<br />

<br />
10. The Jewish refugees were forced to flee from Arab lands due to Arab brutality, persecution and programs.
<br />

<br />
11. The number of Arab refugees who left Israel in 1948 is estimated to be around 630,000. The number of Jewish refugees from Arab land is estimated to be the same.
<br />

<br />
12. Arab refugees were INTENTIONALLY not absorbed or integrated into the Arab lands to which they fled, despite the vast Arab territory. Out of the 100,000,000 refugees since World War II, theirs is the only refugee group in the world that has never been absorbed or integrated into their own peoples' lands. Jewish refugees were completely absorbed into Israel, a country no larger than the state of New Jersey.
<br />

<br />
13. The Arab-Israeli Conflict: The Arabs are represented by eight separate nations, not including the Palestinians. There is only one Jewish nation. The Arab nations inititated all five wars and lost. Israel defended itself each time and won.
<br />

<br />
14. The P.L.O.'s Charter still calls for the destruction of the State of Israel. Israel has given the Palestinians most of the West Bank land, autonomy under the Palestinian Authority, and has supplied them.
<br />

<br />
15. Under Jordanian rule, Jewish holy sites were desecrated and the Jews were denied access to places of worship. Under Israeli rule, all Muslim and Christian sites have been preserved and made accessible to people of all faiths.
<br />

<br />
16. The U.N. Record on Israel and the Arabs: of the 175 Security Council resolutions passed before 1990, 97 were directed against Israel.
<br />

<br />
17. Of the 690 General Assembly resolutions voted on before 1990, 429 were directed against Israel.
<br />

<br />
18. The U.N. was silent while 58 Jerusalem Synagogues were destroyed by the Jordanians.
<br />

<br />
19. The U.N. was silent while the Jordanians systematically desecrated the ancient Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives.
<br />

<br />
20. The U.N. was silent while the Jordanians enforced an apartheid-like policy of preventing Jews from visiting the Temple Mount and the Western Wall.

The errors I saw included:
<br />

<br />
Romans imposed the Diaspora on the Jews.  They were unable to occupy Jerusalem after that time (literally driven out of Israel purely on an ethnic basis circa 68-72 AD.)  A recent archaeological find at the "Colosseum" in Rome includes an inscription dated to the 70s AD that explains that the Colosseum was built with the pillage from Jerusalem.   It seems a little much to claim that Jerusalem was the capital of Judaism after 70 AD.  I also think it presents a certain amount of historical perspective to note that the Romans, not the Arabs, expelled Jews from Jerusalem.
<br />

<br />
I'm not certain about Mohammed coming to Jerusalem.  That flies in the face of Arabic/Muslim claims that he ascended from where the "Dome on the Rock" is.  (Not that I agree he ascended, just strange that they would make the claim when he never even went there.)
<br />

<br />
The claim that the Arabs started all of the wars is blatantly not true.  The French and British were responsible for the 1956 war.  Israel attacked pre-emptively in 1967 based on Soviet Union attempts, in communications to both sides, to suggest that Israel was preparing to attack. 
<br />

<br />
Follow that logic...there is significant historical information to prove this:
<br />

<br />
1.  The Soviet Union communicated to Arab States that Israel was amassing troops.
<br />

<br />
2.  Israel denied and invited Arab State representatives to visit...not sure if they did nor not, though the amassing was supposed to be near the Golan Heights.
<br />

<br />
3.  Arab States did amass troops in response.
<br />

<br />
4.  Israel's military at the time was a working military (roughly equivalent to our reserves), so mobilizing to 'wait' at the border would have destroyed their economy.  They chose to attack in order to respond to the possibility of aggression.
<br />

<br />
In other words, the 1967 conflict probably can't be blamed on either...though it would be a little more accurate to portray Israel as the agressor...much in the same way that it is a little more accurate to portray the US as the agressor in Iraq, even though our response is actually a followup to Hussein's unwillingness to meet either the terms of the 1991 ceasefire or the UN resolutions since then.
<br />

<br />
Just curious if anyone else sees any blatantly incorrect items in that list.  (Not trying to foment a philosophical or sectarian fight, really is curiosity.)
