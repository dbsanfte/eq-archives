<font class="print-normal"><b>Reagent Coverage</b><br>
<br>
The need for Reagent coverage is an important issue on raids. Especially on open raids. The amount of reagents that a raid can go threw in a short time is staggering. Ask any cleric that goes on one. The amount of tells for virtue and symbol is insane. Lets break it down a little.<br>
 <br>
<i>Click article title (or <a href="http://www.eqluclin.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=316&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0">here</a>) for rest of article.</i><br /><br />
1. Beginning of raid. IF we can use MGB we spend 2 peri’s to cover raid that is there and on time. Now add the Bo9 people that hate virtue with a passion and want symbol. Normally they are spread threw out the raid and have to be targeted one at a time. figure 10 peris to cover them( I am bidding kinda low here)<br>
2. Late comers to the raid.(UH! did I, miss MGB?) add another few peris to the out the window fund figure 5 - 10 peeps on an average.( following me so far we over a stack of peris at cost that over 200 plat and we have yet to leave the starting line.)<br>
3. Then of course there are deaths( to be expected) on the way to main target. figure 10 - 15 deaths ( seems assisting MT is to tough for some people or the manic agro lovers take your pick)<br>
there another 10 - 15 peris gone.<br>
4. WOOT we at a named!!! Divine Intervention on the MT. 2 emeralds used . Lets say healing rot is interrupted for some reason.( cleric dies. MT OOR.  you get the picture) cast DI again. ( wash , rinse repeat as necessary) on TT alone I went threw a stack of emeralds average cost over 600 plat.(BUT we won with only 3 deaths)<br>
5. What do you mean all the pallies and Clerics are dead? RUT ROO!! We wiped BUT a necro mancer is still standing WOOT!!! Say hello to a necro rez. 1 Essence Emerald to rez a clicky cleric.( average bazaar price 350 plat)<br>
<br>
This is just a small break down. Not covering coffins if needed. pearls for Coh if needed. a Raid force is a very money hungry  machine!!!! And so far there is nothing to set up to help take care of that. SOME raid leaders repay the clerics and other people if they ask others forget or have never given it much thought. <br>
What I am suggestioning is that someone take a step forward and start a Reagent fund for the raids. There are a few things that can be done to help fund this. And I leave it to the powers that be to decide on a good way to handle this but here are a couple of suggestions.<br>
<br>
1. Charge for the raids. nothing pricey. say 50 plat. to get in. helps cover lots of Reagent costs and everyone can move on. this won’t make or break anyone but if u look at all the peeps that go to a raid it adds up quickly. I suggest that someone is put in charge of that payment fund. They have to keep records and post them on a set time schedule. (amount in. amount out and to who and for what)<br>
<br>
2. Someone is assigned to loot for raid. almost every drop has a price tag on it when u head to a vendor. If it is a quest item roll like normal (maybe charge 100 plat to winner. once again nothing really high) The loot is the sold to vendor  and u then repay all reagents used . what is left over goes to the person who looted.( I suggest they post how much was spent on reagents and to who they was given to and how much they got to keep. OR the left over cash goes to a special RA raid fund)<br>
<br>
3. If u want a buff that costs . you pay for it. plan and simple. no money no buffy.<br>
<br>
These are just a couple of ideas. And here is something to think about. The amount of reagents used by me alone in the past day tallied over 1k. That was just one raid. No money back. no reagents returned. Cash out of pocket. <br>
I truly think something needs to be done about this. In the cleric channel we started joking around about not buffing or rezzing peeps who did stupid things.(i.e. break a chanters mez. rez chanter rebuff em but leave the mez breaker down and out for the rest of raid) We got a great laugh out of it. But we didn’t do it. Each rez was costing a cleric over 10 plat a rez . Cause you know how people are . I been rezed. Now gimmie my virtue. No thanks. No please. Just a solid demand. Remember the clerics on the raid are there and spending cash to be there . So take time to thank them . With out em you not going ANYWHERE!!! <br>
