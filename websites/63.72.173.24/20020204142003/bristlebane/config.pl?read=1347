<P>This raid went well all but for one thing, or should I say one guild, CIRCLE OF LEGENDS came in while we were grouping CoH there and ks-ed Phinny, we told them multiple time we were doing kedge, they have a link to to Rodins website on thier msg boards (where my Kedge Keep raid was posted since MON, 31-DEC-2001 12:12 PM, and scheduled to start SUN, 13-JAN-2002 1:00 PM (all central time) , so they can't say they don't look at this board, and even tho we told them not to do it they did anyways. And were quite rude about it. I won't forget them, many petitioned them and I suggest that you guys do too.
<P>We killed everything else in the zone, including
<P>Undertow Corrrupted Sea Horse Estrella and all sea horses including the ones near phinny
<P>(but no phinny was to be had)
<P>I am sorry I couldn't help you guys get your epic. I had a friend in the CoL guild who specifically told them I was raiding it as they were putting together groups to come ks us, and they simple said they didn't care and that they would get there first. I wish they was something more I could have done, but I hope to see you all on next raid, and maybe, just maybe those arses of Legend will not be there, and we can really get Phinny
