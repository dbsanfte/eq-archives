<P>
<P>PRELUDE TO THE PRESENT.

<P>&quot;I have nothing left to give for the cause...but my own life, my own soul...&quot;

<P>All things die. Everything breaks down and decays. Nothing is spared the caress of Entropy. These are the facts of Reality as most know it. There are those, however; who know otherwise. These entities are aware that if you serve Entropy then it serves you as well.
<P>Those that lurk in the underworlds, the demons, are possessed of the very essence of Entropy. Mortals turned into things unholy. They are its agents, servants, worshippers and lovers. To embrace Entropy is to exist in its favor, indefinitely, until Oblivion swallows all. Some have a choice in this process, while others come about it unwillingly.
<P>In this world, those who embrace Entropy are powerful beyond belief. In this world, love and purity are banished from the hearts of all but a select few. In this world, though many do not realize, all serve a darker entity. This world is Azaroth, a dark realm where war has taken place of hope. No longer does grass cover the land, nor trees, nor stream of blue water. All is a strange orange in hue, a baren landscape, cracked and torn; distant from what it once was. The sky is alight with fire, and the streams are crimson with blood.
<P>For thousands of millennia, a war has been fought between the two races of Azaroth; the Wildrunner Suldanar Elves, and the Azgrath Humans. So long has this war been waged, that neither side remembers the reason for its beginning. All they know is that they must eliminate the other, despite what sins they have to commit in the process; victory is the sole purpose.
<P>However, neither has shifted the balance in their favor. Only the senseless slaughter of billions has been fulfilled. And, yet, they both still fight strongly for whatever cause their ancestors fought for before them. That is ignorance, my brothers. Ignorance which led them to a suffering more profound than any could comprehend.
<P>Little did they know, that with the lusty rape of each elven woman by a human soldier, the brutal slaying of human children by elven priests to cleanse them of their sins, each senseless sin commited created demons in the underworld. Disgusting, rotten, horrid masses of damnation made strong by the sins of the mortals. Mortals, having been slain in battle, transformed into the epitome of their anger and sacrilage.
<P>The beauty of it all! It was almost as dreadfully pleasant to my eye as my homeland was before my exile. The charred and broken land, scattered with a million corpses. I watched as, even though the bodies of their comrades coated the ground like grass; in fact, seeming to have become the ground itself; they crawled and hacked their way through to reach the other of their enemies that did the same. I have never, my brothers, seen such determination in death. I almost shed a tear. Almost.
<P>I stood upon a high cliff overlooking the battlefield. I was but a lone figure and, of course, my presence would not be noticed at such a distance. Howling and the cries of pain filled the air like a symphony of death, the sound of steel ringing clear in the early morning light. I watched until the last man fell, without tearing my gaze away for a mere moment. This was the last battle of the war. I knew such, because I was going to be the reason for its end. I wanted to be present for such an occasion. The ending of a war that had existed for hundreds of billions of years.
<P>I could feel the legions of the underworld growing stronger. I could sense their anticipation of fresh blood, and the meat of these mortals. In fact, I could sense nearly all of those slain before my eyes BECOMMING such creatures. Excellent , I thought. For the legion of the underworld would SOON be MY army.
<P>With a slow intake of breath I turned. I had someplace important to go. I arrived upon this plane mere moments before, and I already wished to get to work. I was undrained from my planar-travel spellcasting. I was at the apex of my power. A step down from being what I wished to be: A God. None could step in my path. Those who did were simple weaved out of the pattern by my magic. Weaved out of life itself by a few chosen incantations and gestures of my hand.
<P>Teristra was a thought far behind me. I had to concentrate on what truely mattered at this point in time. What I had been watching this plane for half of my life in expectation. The shift of the balance of the Gods, and the grow of evil. With my power, I was unstoppable, even to the Gods themselves. I simply had to be...placed...upon the throne.
<P>I glided to Flamescale, an ancient Red Dragon from my home plane. I killed the Dragon, placed his soul in his own disembodied eye, and made him my servant. With my power, I could bring back his essence and place it into his physical form, though only once per day.
<P>I climbed atop his back, positioning myself firmly in between his shoulder-blades, and gave the order to take flight. He breathed in deeply, the sound like a gnomish furnace, and beat his great, leathery red wings to the sky. Soon we reached my destination. The Temple of the Suldanar Elves. The only place within the world granted vegitation, it was a place of holiness so profound, that I could feel it radiating toward me even at my distance. It had to be one of the most beautiful sights I had ever seen.
<P>Twilight glinted in a rosy hue off of the windows in the many structures erected on the surface of the Temple, the sharp reflected rays seeming to only enhance the beauty and peacefulness of the view which few had seen; far above the world, constantly hidden in a seemingly magical veil of clouds. Taking in the vastness, I marveled at the large building that now seemed to be calling to me. Made of white and gray marble, the building is flat to the ground, stretching out across a large area and up to the heavens
<P>White marble spires twisted to the heavens, walk-ways and cat-walks connecting them to one another. The emblema of the God of the Heavens, as he was known here; strange, I thought, that a God had not had a name; etched beautifully into the ancient marble. Lush grass and trees surrounded the Temple, ending where the land was left unblessed. I saw the elves, my 'kin', gliding here and there. All donned in white robes of clergy, or paladin, or wizard. This is where the armies of Suldanar regrouped, met, and went off to their deaths.
<P>As the black shadow of my Red flew across the gigantic Temple, I saw the elves scattering and staring in horror as the Dragonfear took hold of them. Dragons were something unknown to this land, and I am sure that Flamescale was mistaken for some God. Nevertheless, thousands of arrows were loosed in our direction. None hit, of course, for we were protected by my will and magic.
<P>If I didn't need their aid, I would have redirected their projectiles back at them, but I kept myself from doing so. Landing before the massive, golden doors of the Temple; both etched with arcane and holy symbols, a pain shot through my body that I had felt time and time again when I entered holy ground. I did not show any pain, however, to my kin who looked upon me in horror and surprise. I would never show elves pain. I dismounted from my Wyrm, muttered the words needed to transform his essence into his own eye once again, and tucked him into the secrect pocket within my robes.
<P>I was clad in my typical garb. Black robes, lacking runes; for who needed cabalistic symbols when they were this powerful?; the dagger Deathbite at my hip, and my fingers of my left hand wrapped about the Staff of the Darktide.
<P>Gah! What fools! Didn't they realize that their arrows could not harm me? They continued to loose them, nevertheless, and I did not cease in my pace towards the golden doors that led to the bowels of the Temple. Reaching the great doors, with arrows whizzing past my form, but never touching me, I waved a hand and calmly pushed upon them. I could feel the strain of the knights behind, pushing with all their might to keep the door closed. Nevertheless, my single hand forced them back.
<P>&quot;I do not wish-&quot; I was cut off as I had to bark words of an incantation swiftly, a violent gust of wind blowing back the rushing paladins. It took a few more minutes to get everyone quiet, though. I placed all of the paladins before me, about eighty or so, into a deep sleep with a wave of my hand. Protected myself against holy bombardments of divine projectiles from the Priests. Knocked aside a few magic missiles and lightning bolts that were cast by mundane magelings, and cast a spell that simply made each individual's mouth vanish.
<P>I tried again, &quot;I do not wish to do battle. As you can see, I am much more powerful than all of you.&quot; I kept my hood donned, my face shadowed by all before me. I could have been a Human Wizard, though powerful beyond the likes of them all. &quot;I have come to see the Gate. Either you shall direct me to it, or I will slaughter each of you without mercy. I am not a part of your army, nor am I a part of the Human army. I am here on my own accord. Do what I wish, and you will not die. Simple, no?&quot;
<P>Through the tears, the hateful glances, and the frightened looks, I saw a face that could have been Her. A sliver of pain went through my body, forcing me to my knees upon the Temple floor, crying out in agony as I looked upon what I thought was her face. Then, as I refocused, I saw that it was simply one with Her look of compassion, understanding, and sadness. I calmed, collected myself, and thrust all thoughts of my beloved Bird aside from my mind.
<P>I stood, dispelled the Silent Mouth I had cast upon this elfmaid, and bowed deeply. &quot;Milady,&quot; I began. &quot;I have come from far away. I need the Gate, or all I have come for is meaningless. Will you help?&quot; Like she had a choice. I knew, by the red robes she wore, that she was the High Priestess of this Temple. She wasn't angry, or vengeful as she nodded and led me through the crowd.
<P>&quot;You must dispel this terrible curse you've placed upon my clergy, Dark Wanderer,&quot; she answered as she led. Immediately, struck awed by her beauty and knowledge of my title, I dispelled the spell only to be confronted by more silence. No one spoke.
<P>She turned to the hall at the right, her hands disappearing into the folds of her deep red robe. She waited for me to catch up, and then continueed on her slow and tedious walk down the hallway that twisted slowly to the left, heading around the tower. Doorways to study and meditation rooms lined the passageway, but the young woman paid them no heed. Her eyes were concentrated at the white stone floor as she moved with elvish grace.
<P>Etched on the walls of the passageway were scenes depicting the Great Ages of Aztaroth. I stopped for a moment to look, but then continued after my guide into the warm and inviting recesses of the dim area. The wooden door creaked slightly as she opened it and stepped into the softly-lit room. Orbs of light hung in a way so it illuminated but did not disturb the passerby or the person reading intently. Magical by origin, the orbs glowed and floated on their own accord.
<P>The walls were covered still with the runes and etchings of the Ages. The floors in the large entryway were covered in fine rugs, and furniture was placed near the walls. I recognized some of the runes within the entryway. They were runes of protection from extraplanar creatures, like demons. Good, I thought. She knows where I wish to go.
<P>Before us was a large door, also carved with similar runes, and two other guards. Gliding past them, my steps silent, we entered through the doors into a shadowed chamber. There appeared to be no ceiling, or walls to our sides. All was lost in blackness. Except a single vision. Two HUGE double-doors seemed to materialize out of the blackness. The Gate I needed to enter the underworld.
<P>&quot;You have come, Dark Wanderer, as we knew you would from prophecy,&quot; she said, turning to look upon me with green eyes much like my birds. She turned back, looking upon the Gates. &quot;There is no way for us to stop you from doing this. There is no way to stop the inevitable. So, I give you this warning, what you are about to do will be your downfall.&quot;
<P>&quot;Prophecy means nothing to me.&quot; I swept back my hood, revealing my elven heritage. As she turned back, she looked upon me in horror. I could almost hear her thinking: AN ELF! . I smiled to her, moved to the doors and examined them with curiousity.
<P>A beautiful structure, to me at least, which depicted one's entry into hell. From death, to being dragged down by the demons, to the God of the Underworld himself sitting upon his thrown in mockery. &quot;Leave me,&quot; I ordered. She left, without a word, as though she accepted what would occur. I found that quite commendable; that she had the strength to simply leave.
<P>I continued my research upon the ancient passage into the embodiement of all that was evil, and found some ancient text that was truely to my interest. It was in perfectly etched demonic script, something I had studied in the Underdark with my time with the Drow elves, and understood enough of it to comprehend:
<P>It is said from a dying golden tree This was the last of its fruit, Set to be seen higher and higher, Strong and beautiful was the heart of fire.
<P>&quot;A riddle,&quot; I said aloud to myself, rubbing my chin in thought. I knew, somehow, that the answer to this riddle was the only way to unlock the Gate. None of my magic could bypass the demonic symbols of protection. This angered me, though easy enough the riddle was. It didn't occur to me, until months after when I sat within my private chamber inside the Temple.
<P>I had been researching various histories of this plane, trying to see if there was any significance within. The Gate had been created before Time, and the Temple was built about it, as if to protect from what was held within. I rested my volume of ancient lore upon my small cot, and watched as the darkness gave way to light.
<P>I stood immediately, and spoke the world that brought me back to the dark gate. &quot;The Sun,&quot; I hissed to the Gate, but I recieved no answer. This made me more angry, for I knew that it was the only answer. My anger could be a dangerous thing, no, it is a dangerous thing at times.
<P>I raised my hands, lightning jolting forth from my fingertips. It strike the gigantic door, knocking me back as it was reflected from the surface. It hit the ceiling that I couldn't see, huge chunks of black marble falling to the floor. Covering myself with my cloak as pieces fell about me, a single stream of sunlight flowed through the hole and struck the Gate. I heard the creeking of old, rusted hinges and, there it stood within in a sheer wall of darkness, and in the wall it gaped wide, like a mouth of night.
<P>Silence struck me as though a physical thing. That is all that came through from this dark gate, even though I could hear the screaming of the clergy throughout the Temple, obviously having heard my angry screams and the crash of the cieling. I gathered my robes about me, and stood, prepared for whatever may come from the bowel of this darkness.
<P>Red eyes gleamed, thousands, no, millions. Or perhaps more than that. I prepared spells that would destroy whatever foe I would come across, though what occured next made me more curious than hostile. Demons strode from the gate, donned in armor and brandishing swords of unholy make. Each one who walked past me bowed, their hundred eyes downcast, before moving on. An entire army strode past me, composed of the hundreds of billions of years of human sin. In fact, I had lost track of all time. Little did I know that I had stood there, intranced by what I had seen, for more than three days.
<P>The screams went swift. All within the Temple died and, before my very eyes, I saw the white marble turned diseased. It faded to grey, then black, as though touched by the contaminated hands of these creatures. Smiling, I entered where my soon-to-be servants exited, into a world of pain and agony and disgust. It was a land created from human bone and sinew, with rivers of blood and the pus of children.
<P>I knew where to go, though I had never been upon this realm, as though it wanted me to defeat the current Master. I do not remember how long I had travelled through the evil wastes. Hours seemed to fly by like minutes. Minutes like hours. Seconds like years. Years like seconds. It was so confusing, but I kept moving. Without fear, without any sense of danger.
<P>I came to a large throne, made of what the realm was comprised of. Skulls lined the top, skulls of creatures I've never before seen, of humans, of elves, of animals. I saw it pulse as though living, blood oozing from the sides and spraying upon the ground like an artery sliced open from the sword of an enemy.
<P>&quot; WHO DARES ENTER MY REALM? &quot; I heard the voice speak, booming in my ear from darkness unfathomable. I struggled to maintain sane, though my will is strong and the wish to flee was overcame. Slowly the Master of the realm materialized within his bloody throne. &quot; A MORTAL? HAHA. YOU'VE DONE WELL, ELF. YOU HAVE ALLOWED MY ARMIES TO SPREAD ACROSS THIS PATHETIC EARTH, SLAUGHTERING ALL THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH. YOU HAVE SERVED ME WELL, YET YOU ARE FROM ANOTHER WORLD. SINCE YOU HAVE SERVED ME, I WILL MAKE YOU MY GENERAL.&quot;
<P>I stared into the eyes of the creature. Two at the side of the skull, and one directly in the center, bigger than the others and gleaming like a jewel with fire trapped within. His body was sinuous, like a viper's, and he coiled in the chair instead of sat. Huge, leathery wings were folded at his side, and the horns upon his head stretched higher than I could see at the time. Saliva, which burst into flame upon contact with...I guess you could call air, fell to the bloody earth in fireballs.
<P>&quot;I have not come so far,&quot; I spoke without fear, though inside I was sure he could smell it secreted, &quot;to become your servant. I am to take your place.&quot; Simply said, no?
<P>&quot; HAHAHAHAH! YOU IGNORANT MORTAL! YOU SHALL-&quot;
<P>&quot;Bah. Save me your words. I am your successor.&quot;
<P>&quot; HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH A MANOR? I AM A GOD! VERY WELL, YOU SHALL PERISH LIKE THE REST UPON THE WORLD. YOU HAVE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE COMING TO ME. FOR I AM ASMODAN, RULER OF DEATH AND DARKNESS! &quot;
<P>&quot;I am the Dark Wanderer. You need nothing more than that title.&quot;
<P>The world erupted around me, flames spouting out of the blood-coated earth and snapping at me like vipers. I waved my hands in the symbols needed to bring forth a magical shield that, even with the strength of the plane this demon had lived upon for all of existence striking at me, the fire could not penetrate. The anger I saw in Asmodan's eyes was beyond anything I had ever seen.
<P>His clawed hands, which reminded me of Flamescale's, stretched out. Hot red circles appeared beneath me and above me, energies that were soon joined by a beam of energy so profound, I had to leap out of the way less be destroyed. I retaliated with my own magic, knowing what his weaknesses were, though hard as it was to expose them. The eye was his only source of death. The eye atop his head, the one larger than the rest.
<P>Centuries we battled. For time here was different than upon the plane Teristra was located. Seconds in the city of Teristra were decades upon this plane. The fight was devastating both in the realm of Asmodan, as well as the realm of the living. I fought servants of the Dark Lord, souls that had been wracked and torn from their corpses and thrust into his services. I fought the General's of his army. Huge creatures with the torso and breast of women, and the eight legs of spiders. So endless were the wave of creatures that I thought it would never end.
<P>Then, upon beating all of those who lingered within the Underworld to protect their Master, I turned my gaze upon the battered and broken Asmodan. Indeed, my magic was powerful and, even to a god, was dangerous. I had recieved my own wounds, of course, but nothing that compared to his. Centuries of battle had made me stronger. I was a God now, having sucked the souls of the demons from their husks with each kill. So, moving quietly over to the form of Asmodan, which breathed heavily as I stopped before it, he decided to fight once more.
<P>Reaching out with his clawed hand, he wrapped his fingers, which were the size of tree trunks, about me and began to crush. Screaming, I pushed upon his digits to no avail. I felt my ribs snap, my organs pop with each pound of pressure. &quot; YOU CANNOT DEFEAT ME! &quot; Then, without thinking, I plunged my staff deep into the eye atop his skull. A strange, colorful blood oozed out as I plunged it deeper and deeper, until the jewel at the top was all that was visable. With spasms of agony, I felt the hands loosen. He fell to the bloody earth that was once his realm, and I with him.
<P>&quot;You...are...dead,&quot; I muttered through the froth of blood at my lips. &quot;Grant me TRUE Godhood!&quot; Energies poured from his body as it decayed, surging into me. It was a power I had never imagined. My blood raced. My heart beat no longer. My brain didn't function. Yet, my thinking was heighted beyond mortal comprehension. I stood as my wounds healed and, calmly, moved to the throne that was now mine.
<P>&quot;Damn. How simple this was.&quot;
<P>The creatures let loose from my ambition destroyed all in their path. Every being upon the plane was slaughtered. The Elves and the Humans, looking past their war for now, decided to make attempts together at destroying the hordes. But they were too few, and the demons too numerous. Eventually, my hordes destroyed all.
<P>This went on for a millennia.
<P>However, with my powers, I called them back. I allowed the God of the Heavens and the Goddess of the Earth, who had been 'killed' by the devastation of the humans, to reclaim their world. I allowed the God of the Heavens to place new races upon the earth, and the Goddess of the Earth to repair her damaged streams and jungles and forests. I allowed all to return to what it once was before the Great War that ravaged the lands. Of course, none upon the earth gave me credit.
<P>Eventually, my power having grown so strong that I became unfocused and uncaring of what occured, because nothing could destroy me, the Goddess and the God GREW in strength. Seperate, they were meaningless fools who could not fathom MY power. But, together, they were a threat.
<P>They both, hand in hand, infiltrated my realm. They forced me into the body that I onced inhabited as Rahlaer Shadowfyre, and thrust me upon the Earth once more as an avatar. Furious to have the true Asmodan reincarnated and placed atop my throne, I began spells that would expell all of my energy. The avatars of all Three Gods placed upon the Earth to confront me, I cast these spells. Such a force of magic rippled through the plane that even the Gods couldn't resist. All was torn apart, all destroyed. Planets crumbled. Races vanished. Space tore.
<P>And I, once again, was sent twisting through the planes.

<P>I awoke with my face in grass and, tasting it, realized I was not in MY realm. I stood to look upon the white marble of a strange land and, around me, were my kin. I was...in my homeland? No, no, this couldn't be. This place was different, yet it still held the beauty that Silvanesti did. I was in another world and, to my fear, was mortal once again.
<P>Eventually, I would find out that this world was Norrath, and that I was stripped of my power with the expulsion and destruction of the plane I was at previous to this one. I was in a new land, with new possibilities.
<P>MY TIME WOULD COME AGAIN!

&gt; PRELUDE TO THE PRESENT. 

&gt; &quot;I have nothing left to give for the cause...but my own
&gt; life, my own soul...&quot;

&gt; The sky is alight with fire, and the streams are crimson with blood.
&gt; 

&gt; For thousands of millennia, a war has been fought between the

&gt; Humans. So long has this war been waged, that neither side remembers

&gt; seeming to have become the ground itself; they crawled and hacked
&gt; their way through to reach the other of their enemies that did the
&gt; same. I have never, my brothers, seen such determination in death.
&gt; I almost shed a tear. Almost. 

&gt; I stood upon a high cliff overlooking the battlefield. I was
&gt; but a lone figure and, of course, my presence would not be noticed
&gt; at such a distance. Howling and the cries of pain filled the air like
&gt; a symphony of death, the sound of steel ringing clear in the early
&gt; morning light. I watched until the last man fell, without tearing
&gt; my gaze away for a mere moment. This was the last battle of the war.
&gt; I knew such, because I was going to be the reason for its end. I wanted
&gt; to be present for such an occasion. The ending of a war that had existed
&gt; for hundreds of billions of years. 

&gt; I could feel the legions of the underworld growing stronger.
&gt; I could sense their anticipation of fresh blood, and the meat of these
&gt; mortals. In fact, I could sense nearly all of those slain before my
&gt; eyes BECOMMING such creatures. Excellent , I thought. For the legion
&gt; of the underworld would SOON be MY army. 

&gt; With a slow intake of breath I turned. I had someplace important
&gt; to go. I arrived upon this plane mere moments before, and I already
&gt; wished to get to work. I was undrained from my planar-travel spellcasting.
&gt; I was at the apex of my power. A step down from being what I wished
&gt; to be: A God. None could step in my path. Those who did were simple
&gt; weaved out of the pattern by my magic. Weaved out of life itself by
&gt; a few chosen incantations and gestures of my hand. 

&gt; Teristra was a thought far behind me. I had to concentrate on
&gt; what truely mattered at this point in time. What I had been watching
&gt; this plane for half of my life in expectation. The shift of the balance
&gt; of the Gods, and the grow of evil. With my power, I was unstoppable,
&gt; even to the Gods themselves. I simply had to be...placed...upon the
&gt; throne. 

&gt; I glided to Flamescale, an ancient Red Dragon from my home plane.
&gt; I killed the Dragon, placed his soul in his own disembodied eye, and
&gt; made him my servant. With my power, I could bring back his essence
&gt; and place it into his physical form, though only once per day. 

&gt; I climbed atop his back, positioning myself firmly in between
&gt; his shoulder-blades, and gave the order to take flight. He breathed
&gt; in deeply, the sound like a gnomish furnace, and beat his great, leathery
&gt; red wings to the sky. Soon we reached my destination. The Temple of
&gt; the Suldanar Elves. The only place within the world granted vegitation,
&gt; it was a place of holiness so profound, that I could feel it radiating
&gt; toward me even at my distance. It had to be one of the most beautiful
&gt; sights I had ever seen. 

&gt; Twilight glinted in a rosy hue off of the windows in the many
&gt; structures erected on the surface of the Temple, the sharp reflected
&gt; rays seeming to only enhance the beauty and peacefulness of the view
&gt; which few had seen; far above the world, constantly hidden in a seemingly
&gt; magical veil of clouds. Taking in the vastness, I marveled at the
&gt; large building that now seemed to be calling to me. Made of white
&gt; and gray marble, the building is flat to the ground, stretching out
&gt; across a large area and up to the heavens 

&gt; White marble spires twisted to the heavens, walk-ways and cat-walks
&gt; connecting them to one another. The emblema of the God of the Heavens,
&gt; as he was known here; strange, I thought, that a God had not had a
&gt; name; etched beautifully into the ancient marble. Lush grass and trees
&gt; surrounded the Temple, ending where the land was left unblessed. I
&gt; saw the elves, my 'kin', gliding here and there. All donned in white
&gt; robes of clergy, or paladin, or wizard. This is where the armies of
&gt; Suldanar regrouped, met, and went off to their deaths. 

&gt; As the black shadow of my Red flew across the gigantic Temple,
&gt; I saw the elves scattering and staring in horror as the Dragonfear
&gt; took hold of them. Dragons were something unknown to this land, and
&gt; I am sure that Flamescale was mistaken for some God. Nevertheless,
&gt; thousands of arrows were loosed in our direction. None hit, of course,
&gt; for we were protected by my will and magic. 

&gt; If I didn't need their aid, I would have redirected their projectiles
&gt; back at them, but I kept myself from doing so. Landing before the
&gt; massive, golden doors of the Temple; both etched with arcane and holy
&gt; symbols, a pain shot through my body that I had felt time and time
&gt; again when I entered holy ground. I did not show any pain, however,
&gt; to my kin who looked upon me in horror and surprise. I would never
&gt; show elves pain. I dismounted from my Wyrm, muttered the words needed
&gt; to transform his essence into his own eye once again, and tucked him
&gt; into the secrect pocket within my robes. 

&gt; I was clad in my typical garb. Black robes, lacking runes; for
&gt; who needed cabalistic symbols when they were this powerful?; the dagger
&gt; Deathbite at my hip, and my fingers of my left hand wrapped about
&gt; the Staff of the Darktide. 

&gt; Gah! What fools! Didn't they realize that their arrows could
&gt; not harm me? They continued to loose them, nevertheless, and I did
&gt; not cease in my pace towards the golden doors that led to the bowels
&gt; of the Temple. Reaching the great doors, with arrows whizzing past
&gt; my form, but never touching me, I waved a hand and calmly pushed upon
&gt; them. I could feel the strain of the knights behind, pushing with
&gt; all their might to keep the door closed. Nevertheless, my single hand
&gt; forced them back. 

&gt; &quot;I do not wish-&quot; I was cut off as I had to bark words
&gt; of an incantation swiftly, a violent gust of wind blowing back the
&gt; rushing paladins. It took a few more minutes to get everyone quiet,
&gt; though. I placed all of the paladins before me, about eighty or so,
&gt; into a deep sleep with a wave of my hand. Protected myself against
&gt; holy bombardments of divine projectiles from the Priests. Knocked
&gt; aside a few magic missiles and lightning bolts that were cast by mundane
&gt; magelings, and cast a spell that simply made each individual's mouth
&gt; vanish. 

&gt; I tried again, &quot;I do not wish to do battle. As you can see,
&gt; I am much more powerful than all of you.&quot; I kept my hood donned,
&gt; my face shadowed by all before me. I could have been a Human Wizard,
&gt; though powerful beyond the likes of them all. &quot;I have come to
&gt; see the Gate. Either you shall direct me to it, or I will slaughter
&gt; each of you without mercy. I am not a part of your army, nor am I
&gt; a part of the Human army. I am here on my own accord. Do what I wish,
&gt; and you will not die. Simple, no?&quot; 

&gt; Through the tears, the hateful glances, and the frightened looks,
&gt; I saw a face that could have been Her. A sliver of pain went through
&gt; my body, forcing me to my knees upon the Temple floor, crying out
&gt; in agony as I looked upon what I thought was her face. Then, as I
&gt; refocused, I saw that it was simply one with Her look of compassion,
&gt; understanding, and sadness. I calmed, collected myself, and thrust
&gt; all thoughts of my beloved Bird aside from my mind. 

&gt; I stood, dispelled the Silent Mouth I had cast upon this elfmaid,
&gt; and bowed deeply. &quot;Milady,&quot; I began. &quot;I have come from
&gt; far away. I need the Gate, or all I have come for is meaningless.
&gt; Will you help?&quot; Like she had a choice. I knew, by the red robes
&gt; she wore, that she was the High Priestess of this Temple. She wasn't
&gt; angry, or vengeful as she nodded and led me through the crowd. 

&gt; &quot;You must dispel this terrible curse you've placed upon
&gt; my clergy, Dark Wanderer,&quot; she answered as she led. Immediately,
&gt; struck awed by her beauty and knowledge of my title, I dispelled the
&gt; spell only to be confronted by more silence. No one spoke. 

&gt; She turned to the hall at the right, her hands disappearing into
&gt; the folds of her deep red robe. She waited for me to catch up, and
&gt; then continueed on her slow and tedious walk down the hallway that
&gt; twisted slowly to the left, heading around the tower. Doorways to
&gt; study and meditation rooms lined the passageway, but the young woman
&gt; paid them no heed. Her eyes were concentrated at the white stone floor
&gt; as she moved with elvish grace. 

&gt; Etched on the walls of the passageway were scenes depicting the
&gt; Great Ages of Aztaroth. I stopped for a moment to look, but then continued
&gt; after my guide into the warm and inviting recesses of the dim area.
&gt; The wooden door creaked slightly as she opened it and stepped into
&gt; the softly-lit room. Orbs of light hung in a way so it illuminated
&gt; but did not disturb the passerby or the person reading intently. Magical
&gt; by origin, the orbs glowed and floated on their own accord. 

&gt; The walls were covered still with the runes and etchings of the
&gt; Ages. The floors in the large entryway were covered in fine rugs,
&gt; and furniture was placed near the walls. I recognized some of the
&gt; runes within the entryway. They were runes of protection from extraplanar
&gt; creatures, like demons. Good, I thought. She knows where I wish to
&gt; go. 

&gt; Before us was a large door, also carved with similar runes, and
&gt; two other guards. Gliding past them, my steps silent, we entered through
&gt; the doors into a shadowed chamber. There appeared to be no ceiling,
&gt; or walls to our sides. All was lost in blackness. Except a single
&gt; vision. Two HUGE double-doors seemed to materialize out of the blackness.
&gt; The Gate I needed to enter the underworld. 

&gt; &quot;You have come, Dark Wanderer, as we knew you would from
&gt; prophecy,&quot; she said, turning to look upon me with green eyes
&gt; much like my birds. She turned back, looking upon the Gates. &quot;There
&gt; is no way for us to stop you from doing this. There is no way to stop
&gt; the inevitable. So, I give you this warning, what you are about to
&gt; do will be your downfall.&quot; 

&gt; &quot;Prophecy means nothing to me.&quot; I swept back my hood,
&gt; revealing my elven heritage. As she turned back, she looked upon me
&gt; in horror. I could almost hear her thinking: AN ELF! . I smiled to
&gt; her, moved to the doors and examined them with curiousity. 

&gt; A beautiful structure, to me at least, which depicted one's entry
&gt; into hell. From death, to being dragged down by the demons, to the
&gt; God of the Underworld himself sitting upon his thrown in mockery.
&gt; &quot;Leave me,&quot; I ordered. She left, without a word, as though
&gt; she accepted what would occur. I found that quite commendable; that
&gt; she had the strength to simply leave. 

&gt; I continued my research upon the ancient passage into the embodiement
&gt; of all that was evil, and found some ancient text that was truely
&gt; to my interest. It was in perfectly etched demonic script, something
&gt; I had studied in the Underdark with my time with the Drow elves, and
&gt; understood enough of it to comprehend: 

&gt; It is said from a dying golden tree This was the last of its
&gt; fruit, Set to be seen higher and higher, Strong and beautiful was
&gt; the heart of fire. 

&gt; &quot;A riddle,&quot; I said aloud to myself, rubbing my chin
&gt; in thought. I knew, somehow, that the answer to this riddle was the
&gt; only way to unlock the Gate. None of my magic could bypass the demonic
&gt; symbols of protection. This angered me, though easy enough the riddle
&gt; was. It didn't occur to me, until months after when I sat within my
&gt; private chamber inside the Temple. 

&gt; I had been researching various histories of this plane, trying
&gt; to see if there was any significance within. The Gate had been created
&gt; before Time, and the Temple was built about it, as if to protect from
&gt; what was held within. I rested my volume of ancient lore upon my small
&gt; cot, and watched as the darkness gave way to light. 

&gt; I stood immediately, and spoke the world that brought me back
&gt; to the dark gate. &quot;The Sun,&quot; I hissed to the Gate, but I
&gt; recieved no answer. This made me more angry, for I knew that it was
&gt; the only answer. My anger could be a dangerous thing, no, it is a
&gt; dangerous thing at times. 

&gt; I raised my hands, lightning jolting forth from my fingertips.
&gt; It strike the gigantic door, knocking me back as it was reflected
&gt; from the surface. It hit the ceiling that I couldn't see, huge chunks
&gt; of black marble falling to the floor. Covering myself with my cloak
&gt; as pieces fell about me, a single stream of sunlight flowed through
&gt; the hole and struck the Gate. I heard the creeking of old, rusted
&gt; hinges and, there it stood within in a sheer wall of darkness, and
&gt; in the wall it gaped wide, like a mouth of night. 

&gt; Silence struck me as though a physical thing. That is all that
&gt; came through from this dark gate, even though I could hear the screaming
&gt; of the clergy throughout the Temple, obviously having heard my angry
&gt; screams and the crash of the cieling. I gathered my robes about me,
&gt; and stood, prepared for whatever may come from the bowel of this darkness.
&gt; 

&gt; Red eyes gleamed, thousands, no, millions. Or perhaps more than
&gt; that. I prepared spells that would destroy whatever foe I would come
&gt; across, though what occured next made me more curious than hostile.
&gt; Demons strode from the gate, donned in armor and brandishing swords
&gt; of unholy make. Each one who walked past me bowed, their hundred eyes
&gt; downcast, before moving on. An entire army strode past me, composed
&gt; of the hundreds of billions of years of human sin. In fact, I had
&gt; lost track of all time. Little did I know that I had stood there,
&gt; intranced by what I had seen, for more than three days. 

&gt; The screams went swift. All within the Temple died and, before
&gt; my very eyes, I saw the white marble turned diseased. It faded to
&gt; grey, then black, as though touched by the contaminated hands of these
&gt; creatures. Smiling, I entered where my soon-to-be servants exited,
&gt; into a world of pain and agony and disgust. It was a land created
&gt; from human bone and sinew, with rivers of blood and the pus of children.
&gt; 

&gt; I knew where to go, though I had never been upon this realm,
&gt; as though it wanted me to defeat the current Master. I do not remember
&gt; how long I had travelled through the evil wastes. Hours seemed to
&gt; fly by like minutes. Minutes like hours. Seconds like years. Years
&gt; like seconds. It was so confusing, but I kept moving. Without fear,
&gt; without any sense of danger. 

&gt; I came to a large throne, made of what the realm was comprised
&gt; of. Skulls lined the top, skulls of creatures I've never before seen,
&gt; of humans, of elves, of animals. I saw it pulse as though living,
&gt; blood oozing from the sides and spraying upon the ground like an artery
&gt; sliced open from the sword of an enemy. 

&gt; &quot; WHO DARES ENTER MY REALM? &quot; I heard the voice speak,
&gt; booming in my ear from darkness unfathomable. I struggled to maintain
&gt; sane, though my will is strong and the wish to flee was overcame.
&gt; Slowly the Master of the realm materialized within his bloody throne.
&gt; &quot; A MORTAL? HAHA. YOU'VE DONE WELL, ELF. YOU HAVE ALLOWED MY
&gt; ARMIES TO SPREAD ACROSS THIS PATHETIC EARTH, SLAUGHTERING ALL THEY
&gt; COME INTO CONTACT WITH. YOU HAVE SERVED ME WELL, YET YOU ARE FROM
&gt; ANOTHER WORLD. SINCE YOU HAVE SERVED ME, I WILL MAKE YOU MY GENERAL.&quot;
&gt; 

&gt; I stared into the eyes of the creature. Two at the side of the
&gt; skull, and one directly in the center, bigger than the others and
&gt; gleaming like a jewel with fire trapped within. His body was sinuous,
&gt; like a viper's, and he coiled in the chair instead of sat. Huge, leathery
&gt; wings were folded at his side, and the horns upon his head stretched
&gt; higher than I could see at the time. Saliva, which burst into flame
&gt; upon contact with...I guess you could call air, fell to the bloody
&gt; earth in fireballs. 

&gt; &quot;I have not come so far,&quot; I spoke without fear, though
&gt; inside I was sure he could smell it secreted, &quot;to become your
&gt; servant. I am to take your place.&quot; Simply said, no? 

&gt; &quot; HAHAHAHAH! YOU IGNORANT MORTAL! YOU SHALL-&quot; 

&gt; &quot;Bah. Save me your words. I am your successor.&quot; 

&gt; &quot; HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH A MANOR? I AM A GOD!
&gt; VERY WELL, YOU SHALL PERISH LIKE THE REST UPON THE WORLD. YOU HAVE
&gt; MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE COMING TO ME. FOR I AM ASMODAN, RULER OF DEATH
&gt; AND DARKNESS! &quot; 

&gt; &quot;I am the Dark Wanderer. You need nothing more than that
&gt; title.&quot; 

&gt; The world erupted around me, flames spouting out of the blood-coated
&gt; earth and snapping at me like vipers. I waved my hands in the symbols
&gt; needed to bring forth a magical shield that, even with the strength
&gt; of the plane this demon had lived upon for all of existence striking
&gt; at me, the fire could not penetrate. The anger I saw in Asmodan's
&gt; eyes was beyond anything I had ever seen. 

&gt; His clawed hands, which reminded me of Flamescale's, stretched
&gt; out. Hot red circles appeared beneath me and above me, energies that
&gt; were soon joined by a beam of energy so profound, I had to leap out
&gt; of the way less be destroyed. I retaliated with my own magic, knowing
&gt; what his weaknesses were, though hard as it was to expose them. The
&gt; eye was his only source of death. The eye atop his head, the one larger
&gt; than the rest. 

&gt; Centuries we battled. For time here was different than upon the
&gt; plane Teristra was located. Seconds in the city of Teristra were decades
&gt; upon this plane. The fight was devastating both in the realm of Asmodan,
&gt; as well as the realm of the living. I fought servants of the Dark
&gt; Lord, souls that had been wracked and torn from their corpses and
&gt; thrust into his services. I fought the General's of his army. Huge
&gt; creatures with the torso and breast of women, and the eight legs of
&gt; spiders. So endless were the wave of creatures that I thought it would
&gt; never end. 

&gt; Then, upon beating all of those who lingered within the Underworld
&gt; to protect their Master, I turned my gaze upon the battered and broken
&gt; Asmodan. Indeed, my magic was powerful and, even to a god, was dangerous.
&gt; I had recieved my own wounds, of course, but nothing that compared
&gt; to his. Centuries of battle had made me stronger. I was a God now,
&gt; having sucked the souls of the demons from their husks with each kill.
&gt; So, moving quietly over to the form of Asmodan, which breathed heavily
&gt; as I stopped before it, he decided to fight once more. 

&gt; Reaching out with his clawed hand, he wrapped his fingers, which
&gt; were the size of tree trunks, about me and began to crush. Screaming,
&gt; I pushed upon his digits to no avail. I felt my ribs snap, my organs
&gt; pop with each pound of pressure. &quot; YOU CANNOT DEFEAT ME! &quot;
&gt; Then, without thinking, I plunged my staff deep into the eye atop
&gt; his skull. A strange, colorful blood oozed out as I plunged it deeper
&gt; and deeper, until the jewel at the top was all that was visable. With
&gt; spasms of agony, I felt the hands loosen. He fell to the bloody earth
&gt; that was once his realm, and I with him. 

&gt; &quot;You...are...dead,&quot; I muttered through the froth of
&gt; blood at my lips. &quot;Grant me TRUE Godhood!&quot; Energies poured
&gt; from his body as it decayed, surging into me. It was a power I had
&gt; never imagined. My blood raced. My heart beat no longer. My brain
&gt; didn't function. Yet, my thinking was heighted beyond mortal comprehension.
&gt; I stood as my wounds healed and, calmly, moved to the throne that
&gt; was now mine. 

&gt; &quot;Damn. How simple this was.&quot; 

&gt; The creatures let loose from my ambition destroyed all in their
&gt; path. Every being upon the plane was slaughtered. The Elves and the
&gt; Humans, looking past their war for now, decided to make attempts together
&gt; at destroying the hordes. But they were too few, and the demons too
&gt; numerous. Eventually, my hordes destroyed all. 

&gt; This went on for a millennia. 

&gt; However, with my powers, I called them back. I allowed the God
&gt; of the Heavens and the Goddess of the Earth, who had been 'killed'
&gt; by the devastation of the humans, to reclaim their world. I allowed
&gt; the God of the Heavens to place new races upon the earth, and the
&gt; Goddess of the Earth to repair her damaged streams and jungles and
&gt; forests. I allowed all to return to what it once was before the Great
&gt; War that ravaged the lands. Of course, none upon the earth gave me
&gt; credit. 

&gt; Eventually, my power having grown so strong that I became unfocused
&gt; and uncaring of what occured, because nothing could destroy me, the
&gt; Goddess and the God GREW in strength. Seperate, they were meaningless
&gt; fools who could not fathom MY power. But, together, they were a threat.
&gt; 

&gt; They both, hand in hand, infiltrated my realm. They forced me
&gt; into the body that I onced inhabited as Rahlaer Shadowfyre, and thrust
&gt; me upon the Earth once more as an avatar. Furious to have the true
&gt; Asmodan reincarnated and placed atop my throne, I began spells that
&gt; would expell all of my energy. The avatars of all Three Gods placed
&gt; upon the Earth to confront me, I cast these spells. Such a force of
&gt; magic rippled through the plane that even the Gods couldn't resist.
&gt; All was torn apart, all destroyed. Planets crumbled. Races vanished.
&gt; Space tore. 

&gt; And I, once again, was sent twisting through the planes. 

&gt; I awoke with my face in grass and, tasting it, realized I was
&gt; not in MY realm. I stood to look upon the white marble of a strange
&gt; land and, around me, were my kin. I was...in my homeland? No, no,
&gt; this couldn't be. This place was different, yet it still held the
&gt; beauty that Silvanesti did. I was in another world and, to my fear,
&gt; was mortal once again. 

&gt; Eventually, I would find out that this world was Norrath, and
&gt; that I was stripped of my power with the expulsion and destruction
&gt; of the plane I was at previous to this one. I was in a new land, with
&gt; new possibilities. 

&gt; MY TIME WOULD COME AGAIN!
