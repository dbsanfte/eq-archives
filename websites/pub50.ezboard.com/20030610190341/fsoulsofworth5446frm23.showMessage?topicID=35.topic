In the future, we will need raid sign up posts for the raids we WILL be hosting, and I dont like the idea of having strangers reading thru our posts. We should have three main sections- public, guild, and officers. And with the leaving of some friends, we should change up the passwords. Snick make them as you see fit, and send us an email. <p>Nitiena Ebonblaze

Tell me one thing that this guild has talked about in the boards that makes you think that things should be so secretive.. I dont understand.<br>
<br>
And so what if people that have left the guild want to come back and see what people are saying about them, and what the people they once called family have to say behind their back now.<br>
<br>
This guild is going through times and i am afraid to say that i will prolly be leaving the guild soon.  I really enjoy some of you in the guild and i will miss them.. I am tired of getting on and the ONLY people that have something to say at all is Snickerr, I also enjoy talking to nit when i actually get to talk to her.  Otherwise it seams i only get a tell when someone wants something.<br>
<br>
I hope this stuff can be worked out<br>

However i'm sure at one point it will happen and want to ovoid it.<br>
<br>
Also as nitiena said above, that's just one of the many reasons to password protect the conversations, aka posts, within the guild, after all, why do we have a guild chat on the game??<br>
<br>
This isn't to go against you Orcin, I unederstand your concern but also feel that this is important, LN does it and I feel it's a good idea.  If anyone else has concerns about this, PLEASE RESPOND, i want to know before i do it.<br>

Meaning that if one of the officers were to make an offhand remark about another guildie's actions/attitudes, it would have been done to give the other officers a heads up, NOT to berate the person. However, the person in question would feel that they are &quot;singled out&quot; or being picked on for no reall reason.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Some things are just best left unsaid to certain people. I know who I can talk to rationally, and who I cannot. Those that I cant reason with, will have to either decide to become more of what we want as a guildie, or go their own way.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I did NOT wanna lose you. Yes, you have some valid concerns and issues that need to be addressed, but I dont think you were very fair to us to leave after being here for such a short time.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;THIS is how good guilds go bad or fall apart. ONE or TWO key people leave a guild for their own reasons, and the guild starts to unravel. If a friend has left the guild, the other guildmates start to panic, &quot; Is this the end???&quot;<br>
Well, yeah, it CAN be. <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;It really hurt me to lose the two people that left on their own accord. I will miss them both =( I was even hurt when Layha had to dismiss a guildmate; but he left her no choice... Now you have left us, and it also makes me sad =(<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;In hard times, we gotta stick together, not run spiralling out of control. I had planned to take a much needed break from EQ, but I dont wanna come back to NO GUILD. Im trying to keep it all together and strengthen the guild again. When this guild started I was CONSTANTLY watching over it. Recently, I have been obsessed with Planar raids, and it has taken some of my attention from the guild. THIS MUST CHANGE, or we WILL fall.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;And as far as your comment about having only TWO ppl from our guild go on the Hate raid...well, I had about 10 ppl from our guild slated to go. Some of them were frineds that were joining the guild, others were being PLd, and some friends of the guild were going along as well. But, being alot like life, things in EQ dont always go as planned. They all backed out, or were unable to attend for one reason or the other, despite a 2 week notice from myself about the raid =(<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;So, it was VERY embarrassing for me as a GUILDLEADER/RAIDLEADER to have only TWO ppl from my guild in HATE. Heh, I'll trade places with ANYBODY at ANY time...Hehehe, it AINT easy. And to make us stronger, I have to do some things that are going to hurt/offend people, and I dont relish it. I will do what I must, regretfully, but HAS to be done, and Im the one who has to do it.Anyhow, my novel is nearing completion, Ill look for you in game sir...<br>

I think this should be brought up in a guild meeting.

The changing of passwords will be very rare, shouldn't happen to often cause the only time a need for it would be if an offenceive post is made, which like you said yourself, hasn't happened.<br>
<br>
This isn't done to hide anything or add any inconvenience to anyone, I just feel it's a good idea to have cause your guild chat on ezboards should be like it is in game, with few exceptions, of course.<br>
<br>
The postion about a passoword being on for raids wasn't my idea, i'm not sure the position behind that cause Layha and I can filter any bad post out on that, and with BIG raids, those will most likely be done on the Brell ezboard.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps, cya all in the game <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
