Even after having my body summoned, I stuck it out as long as I could bear, sorry I couldn't stay longer, but at 7 am, I was beat, as I'm sure most of you were.  /Applaud Sorka, he was still online and rezzing when I left, he was a trooper as were alot of people there.  But ya, I'm sure we won't hear the end of this one for a while.  Hang in there everyone. <p>Snickerr Satisfya;

I at 2 bubbles of experience, lost my level, never got what i wanted, and spent 6 hrs total on a night before my final exams CRing basically.  About the &quot;logging off&quot; that is completely off base and untrue.  EVERYONE else was loggin off right after their rezzes and i stuck around to try and help CR.  I did as much as I could, pulled 3 corpses out, and then when I had IGs on me, I naturally ran them to the zone.  When zoning, I CRASHED.  I am competletely sorry for crashing and not coming back when i had final exams within 3 hours and I didn't really want to invest the time in CRing with 1 coffin left, no rogues, and little hope.  I stayed as long as I could and did as much as I could, and if it wasn't enough, I am sorry.  The raid ended up taking too much time out of my RL world, and I hate to say it, but this is a game.  I will continue to help with CR today, when i actually have no time at all to do so.  I have led successful vox raids before, and have also led unsuccesful ones, none however, went as badly as this one.  My sincere apologies for that.  Once again, I am not sorry for crashing and not coming back when 8 people were in the zone, but I am sorry for people like Sorka, who gave their time and lost a lot of xp.  I lost 2 bubs myself, and about 1.1k.  If you find this despicable, or intolerable, let me know, because I am man enough to know what is right and what is wrong.  Up to you guys I guess, though i don't see what i could have done more.<br>

Here's how I see it....The raid was a pick up raid, and thus it took a long time for the full force to get to perma.  People became impatient, and began to leave, not a lot but a few, and some key charachters.  Cam also fell into a pit, and we had to pause for a tricky CR that was pulled off quite well actually, and efficiently.  Buffs circle was set up by a druid who had not done this before, and it was going slowly until I took over.  Anyways, after this, we quickly buffed and camped to chat, however, this was not done without losing a few more people who were to tired to go on, even though we were logging to chat, including members of our guild.  I have nothing against that, I understand they were tired, I&quot;m just simply stating that by the time we were reading to actually charge vox, we were down a full groups worth of valuable players, including 2 Clerics, 1 ench, 1 wiz, 1 shaman, and 1 warrior.  The actual fight with vox went alright, I think the main problem was that the command for casters to nuke was given to late, if it had been giving just a few seconds earlier, she probally would not have gotten her cheal off, but that's just opinion.  After we wiped out, IG's started repopping, as well as terrors, because it had taken so long to get to Vox.  This made CR quite a problem, as you might of heard.  Personally, my corpse is still chilling right underneath vox as we speak, as I'm sure some others might be.  I will try to lead some kind of CR tonight for those with trouble.   Anyways, this was a lot more long winded then I had intended for it to be, but I wanted to inform everyone as much as possible, because...knowledge is power :  )  Anyways, I'm posting this from my capmus in between my first final(which I kept falling asleep of!).  I hope this helped somehow, I'm to tired to be sure myself.<br>

Did this raid have an unfortunate turn of events? Yes<br>
Is that going to amount to a hill of beans to me? No<br>
<br>
Are people going to be upset about this? Of Course<br>
Will they get over it? For the most part, Yes<br>
<br>
Will this effect my willingness to attend a "spur of the moment" raid? Probably, but as Bahccus said, that's the risk we took when accepting to do a spur of the moment raid.<br>
Will this effect my willingness to attend a raid that is planned out days ahead of time? Nope<br>
<br>
Sorka, you da man, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  I admire how hard you worked ALL NIGHT to help people get their bodies.  Who cares what someone says to you that doesn't know what is going on, once they get the whole picture, i'm sure their attitude will change, and if not, send them my way :)<br>
<br>
Can, you did an EXCELLENT job in my book, unfortunately, it was a spur of the moment raid, and this type of disaster is very possible to happen, it's a risk we take when doing something like this on the spur of the moment.  The only thing I would suggest after doing this for the first time is that in the future, always have a backup plan and don't be afraid to call it off if you don't feel it will work.  If you do call something like this off while preping and people push you to continue, the weight of the fall will lessen on your part if you don't succede.<br>
<br>
I have not lost respect for ANY person due to this raid, everyone gave 100% and some gave even more.  Try not to think about what was lost, or what others are going to think of us as a guild or individually, but think about what you, individually, have learned.  And, MOST OF ALL, it is, just a game:)<br>
<br>
Take care all, hope to cya in game, keep your chins up :) <p>Snickerr Satisfya;
