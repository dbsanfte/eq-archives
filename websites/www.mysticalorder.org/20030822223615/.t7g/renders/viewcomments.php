		You hace some very nice pictures! The last picture on your page is one of my favorites. "And if I look up in your eyes" and the Forest picture is very nice too. Those are my three fav pictures. Keep up the good work! Maybe some day if you decide to print these to posters I would consider buying one or two :)<br>

		So, what does everyone think of the new features I've added to the site? If you didn't notice at the bottom I've written a site statistics section and I completely recoded showimage.php. Linking other people to images should look a lot less garbled now ;P Since it's all run from a mysql database. Also, I know theres a broken image at the bottom on the site section. Truth be told I don't know what image to put there yet, so I'm waiting till I figure out which image section to use=)<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
