                  amazing moments of my Everquest life. A little before midnight
                  I headed from Luclin to Greater Faydark and after refreshing
                  my epic headed over to Crushbone. Using Improved Invisibility
                  I stealthily made my way through the orc centurions who were
                  on full alert. One spotted me but a quick Ice Spear managed to
                  dispatch him before he could alert the guards - which was good
                  because I was on a very urgent mission. Creeping towards his
                  thrown I noticed a group of distressed fellow adventurers
                  running in the other direction - a horde or orcs chasing after
                  them. This gave me just the chance I needed to slip behind the
                  Emperor's throne where I caught the supreme lord of Castle
                  Crushbone - Emperor Crush himself!&nbsp;</font></p>

                  Emperor Ssraeshza is dead, early Thursday night 69 TMO went to
                  Ssraeshza Temple and decided, you know, I'm tired of this
                  server being so fucking gimp, lets kill the Emperor. So about
                  a couple hours later we engaged the Emperor...28 minutes and a
                  couple thousand sunstrikes and complete heals later...T7 got
                  his king size pin cushion w/ fold out bed back.&nbsp;</font></p>

                  </font><font color="#DCDCDC" size="2">Besides the pin cushion
                  he also left us with some decent loot, 2 Velvet Slippers of
                  Harmony which went to Rubies and Mecalis, Gebron's Demented
                  Cloak which went to Galilo, and Garrison's Superior Sundering,
                  which went to Gemdiver.</font></p>

                  That's all he dropped this time, and it was pretty decent
                  loot. Was it worth the months of camping ore and keys though?
                  Naaa not really. The best loot came from his 5 gimp friends
                  whom each dropped a planes rift which made all the months of
                  commander camps and AE'ing the mines
                  worth it! Most likely most of you don't know what a planes
                  rift is. Well here let me show you:</font></p>

                  Pretty lame right? No flowing thought V or enraging blow, not
                  even any hp or mana. What does a Planes rift do? Ask Zeelot he
                  can tell you since he got there first.</font></p>

                  For anyone who is still having problems following, that means
                  TMO is the first guild on server to get into Vex Thal, the
                  hardest zone in the game. The Emperor kill was the culmination
                  of months of work. We had tried with more people, and we had
                  failed, sometimes failed miserably, sometimes letting some
                  small error - a patch undone or a wiz over nuking - dash our
                  hopes of getting into Vex Thal. But tonight was different.
                  Every single person played at the highest skill level
                  possible. Not only did the Emperor die...he was slaughtered. 1
                  Main tank, *1* died, and our next tank stepped up and locked
                  him perfectly, clerics swapped their targets and wizards
                  unloaded on the poor guy. It was a slaughter, and with 15 less
                  people than our prior best attempt. Bill Murray put in best in
                  the Ghostbusters...We came, we saw, we kicked its ass. We are The Mystical Order.</font></p>

                  have to rush to work and since I was in such a wonderful mood
                  I figured artificial chicken and orange juice could only
                  improve on the moment.. What makes this moment so enjoyable?
                  Well I should start about 28 hours ago...Fennin crashed. There
                  was surprisingly little competition on mobs yesterday - our only challenged spawn of
                  the day was King Tormax by ZS in the early morning. In any
                  event the first mob to fall was Creator.</font></p>

                  headband - 100 hp and other stats, Jesus in a piece of cloth
                  im told - went to Colinee. The Grey Dusted wraps, also a very
                  nice item with 80 hp/mana (sorry didnt get pics on these) went
                  to Naeviticus. The Harnessed Flame Dirk well it was defaulted
                  to some mage because nobody wanted it. We had originally
                  planned for Emperor today but due to unforeseen circumstances
                  an attempt could not be made - leaving us with a higher than
                  average attendence. Since the rest of Ssra hadn't spawned yet
                  we made a quick stop in Kael to take out the Avatar of War. He
                  dropped a Blade of Carnage which went to Sorf, barbarian mask
                  which went to Platt, and his helm - which went to Torlan. At
                  that point one of our newer members asked a very important
                  question as to our next target, Opalopa took care of it.</font></p>

                  Unfortunately as I mentioned we could not kill Emperor last
                  night, so we had to settle for killing the High Priest
                  instead. Our force took him down in a new record time - 9
                  minutes! And whats more important, he dropped really nice loot
                  - 2 FT6 Shield of Ssraeshza's, one to Edroheht and the other
                  to Roses.</font></p>

                  About halfway through the High Priest fight we got a tell
                  saying that servers would be coming down in three hours for maintenance.
                  Seeing we didn't have enough time left to kill any more big
                  mobs we thought we should nab the Arch Lich. Pretty average
                  loot for a pretty average mob. Sorry no loot pics on this -
                  but Faded Skull Medallion to Khomodo and Pristine Jade Idol to

                  finished Arch Lich around 20 minutes before server down, so
                  found our various places to camp out and I went back to IRC,
                  feeling pretty good. I had wanted to kill the Emperor last
                  night, we weren't allowed to, but we still killed Creator, AoW,
                  High Priest, and Arch Lich - and there was going to be a patch</font><font color="#DCDCDC" size="2">.
                  Opa and Tseven had said something about trying to get Cursed

                  really thought he'd do it, so I headed off to bed. About three
                  hours later I got a call from Opa telling me to login </font><font color="#DCDCDC" size="2">for
                  Cursed. I thought it was some cruel practical joke but logged

                  1 very dedicated app, woo Tandria!) waiting in the basement
                  with a spawned Cursed.&nbsp; The fight was long due to a

                  we were able to down the mob without too much trouble - not
                  bad considering it was 8:00 in the morning on the east

                  is what TMO is about, and why I am in such a good mood right
                  now (besides the egg McMuffin). Its not about killing the
                  hardest mobs or having the best equipment. Its about being a
                  group of dedicated highly skilled players who can organize and
                  be where they need to be when they need to be whether its at
                  Creator and AoW and 9 pm at night and 10 hours later killing
                  Cursed - with half the usual number of people used. Its called
                  skill ladies and gentlemen, skill and dedication. I don't mean
                  to belittle any of the other guilds on the server, many are
                  also skilled and dedicated, but none with so long a history
                  and track record of skill and dedication as us. We are The

                  Shortly after that we went to Kael to kill Tormax - boots,
                  dagger - and were prepping for AoW when VI decided they needed
                  to patch servers (Oh damn, not that!) so we rushed back to
                  Ssra. Relogging back in we noticed we had really good
                  attendence and we shouldn't waste it on common mobs.&nbsp; We
                  went up to visit the Emperor and got our best attempt to date

                  Emperor, very very soon.&nbsp; It was only a little past
                  midnight at this point and boasting record attendence we went
                  to Kael. Colinee did an amazing feat pulling Tormax all the
                  way to arena for us to kill, AoW style. It was well worth the
                  trip too - He dropped 2 rings and 2 boots, on top of the
                  talisman and his head.&nbsp; Statue, Idol, and AoW went
                  smoothly and we got some very nice drops - THREE Blades of
                  Carnage, and a Ring of Destruction! Good job everyone!</font></p>

                  I wish I were there to report it in all our glory, but
                  Thursday night we finally killed Vyzh`dra the Cursed; That
                  alone would have marked a great night, I could throw a nice
                  loot pic up here, maybe a good quote or two, and you all would
                  probably be satisfied. Cursed wasn't the only thing TMO killed
                  last night though. We also knocked out THO and the Creator.
                  Incredible right? Cursed, THO, and Creator all in one night?
                  Yeah...it is incredible, but what if I also mentioned that
                  after we killed Cursed we headed up to the zoo and took out
                  the High Priest of Ssraeshza too? Not bad eh? THO, Creator,
                  Cursed, and the High Priest, all in the same night; but we
                  were just getting started. A quick stopover in Akheva found
                  Shei up, so killed the four armed ho quickly before stumbling
                  onto Cazic in PoF - really, what is a night of ownage without
                  a slain God? And we just killed Tunare yesterday and Inny is
                  such a pussy that well, Cazic was the only real God left.
                  After that it was getting pretty late and attendence was
                  starting to lag a bit and people were logging. Enough stayed
                  on to run over to VP quickly for a quick visit to Silverwing
                  and Phara Dar. Nice way to end the night.&nbsp;</font></p>

                  In other news, past couple days since last update we killed
                  Tunare (Essence finally dropped!) killed Burrower (4 rings of
                  depths), Yeli, Dain, AoW somewhere along the way; in other
                  words, right now TMO is running like a well tuned machine and
                  very very soon Emperor Ssraeshza is going to die.</font></p>

                  mad about you're asking? Well some gimps got the idea that
                  they were hot shit and decided that&nbsp; they'd exploit Cursed and kill him. Mr. T
                  doesn't like that. In
                  fact he hates talentless gimps of all sorts, especially ones
                  who gloat about being lame. Anyway, luckily for us there
                  are some mobs that can't be exploited. Let me introduce you to
                  one of them now.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

                  High Priest of Ssraeshza; or he was rather, as you can tell
                  from the above picture he's no longer around. Poor bastard
                  never knew what hit him. Fight lasted an entire nine minutes.
                  Unfortunately I can't say this was a deathless fight. For
                  reasons unknown an anonymous enchanter (read Fawlyn) decided
                  that upon entering the room he'd run up and say hi to the high
                  priest before we started the fight. Anyway, he's an elf so he
                  doesn't count. Once we started the fight not a single person
                  died and it served as a brutal reminder to any&nbsp; Mr. T
                  want-to-be's out there of the ungimp way to kill a monster. He
                  dropped some pretty decent stuff too:</font></p>
