                  I wish I were there to report it in all our glory, but
                  Thursday night we finally killed Vyzh`dra the Cursed; That
                  alone would have marked a great night, I could throw a nice
                  loot pic up here, maybe a good quote or two, and you all would
                  probably be satisfied. Cursed wasn't the only thing TMO killed
                  last night though. We also knocked out THO and the Creator.
                  Incredible right? Cursed, THO, and Creator all in one night?
                  Yeah...it is incredible, but what if I also mentioned that
                  after we killed Cursed we headed up to the zoo and took out
                  the High Priest of Ssraeshza too? Not bad eh? THO, Creator,
                  Cursed, and the High Priest, all in the same night; but we
                  were just getting started. A quick stopover in Akheva found
                  Shei up, so killed the four armed ho quickly before stumbling
                  onto Cazic in PoF - really, what is a night of ownage without
                  a slain God? And we just killed Tunare yesterday and Inny is
                  such a pussy that well, Cazic was the only real God left.
                  After that it was getting pretty late and attendence was
                  starting to lag a bit and people were logging. Enough stayed
                  on to run over to VP quickly for a quick visit to Silverwing
                  and Phara Dar. Nice way to end the night.&nbsp;</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font color="#DCDCDC" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  In other news, past couple days since last update we killed
                  Tunare (Essence finally dropped!) killed Burrower (4 rings of
                  depths), Yeli, Dain, AoW somewhere along the way; in other
                  words, right now TMO is running like a well tuned machine and
                  very very soon Emperor Ssraeshza is going to die.</font></p>

                  been busy though. We've been practicing a lot on Emperor, and
                  also killing some mobs. Among the mobs we killed: Tunare (2x),
                  Blood (2x), Ring of slime, like 4 dains, Arch Lich, THO, and
                  probably some other misc stuff I forgot. Nothing else really

                  the entire Brazilian women's soccer team. So what's he look so
                  mad about you're asking? Well some gimps got the idea that
                  they were hot shit and decided that&nbsp; they'd exploit Cursed and kill him. Mr. T
                  doesn't like that. In
                  fact he hates talentless gimps of all sorts, especially ones
                  who gloat about being lame. Anyway, luckily for us there

                  one of them now.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

                  from the above picture he's no longer around. Poor bastard
                  never knew what hit him. Fight lasted an entire nine minutes.
                  Unfortunately I can't say this was a deathless fight. For
                  reasons unknown an anonymous enchanter (read Fawlyn) decided
                  that upon entering the room he'd run up and say hi to the high
                  priest before we started the fight. Anyway, he's an elf so he
                  doesn't count. Once we started the fight not a single person
                  died and it served as a brutal reminder to any&nbsp; Mr. T
                  want-to-be's out there of the ungimp way to kill a monster. He
                  dropped some pretty decent stuff too:</font></p>

                  I get brutally raped by a 3 foot midget named Peterson coming
                  out of Food Lion this afternoon? Well thats not really
                  important. The simple answer is, we laid waste to half of
                  Luclin, while another guild took out one or two leftover
                  spawns on Velious. So it looks like the only thing up for Zen
                  Sect will be Emperor Crush. Don't worry guys, I'm sure if you
                  get your positioning right you can bow him to death with no
                  problem. So if any ZS come around here tomorrow whining about

                  that. Team MOB headed over to the Deep next to knock off the

                  went almost flawlessly. Unfortunately the loot wasnt all that
                  good except the melee ring, but it sure as hell beats farming

                  <p>&nbsp;You, like many others, may have first stared the game
                  with zone music enabled, but have since turned them off to
                  allow greater game performance during high intensity raid
                  situations and are no longer greeted with the ambient
                  atmosphere of the dungeon or town. Or, you may have chosen to
                  play your own mp3s as you venture through the lands of Norrath,
                  not allowing for a complete immersion in the game as it
                  relates to your guild’s activities. You may have thought
                  that the soundtracks provided did not fully reflect the
                  personality and appearance of your guild’s growth in stature
                  and reputation. Now, as part of Sony Online Entertainment’s
                  continuing commitment to provide EverQuest players with the
                  finest gaming experience available, SOE is pleased to announce
                  a new, reasonably priced, guild theme song service. This
                  service will allow your guild to request a theme song to
                  represent them in the lands of Norrath.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;This new service will broadcast the theme song of
                  your guild’s choice when certain criteria are met. There are
                  three different situations which allow for a guild’s theme
                  song to be played. First, when any member of your guild enters
                  a zone whose average Player Character level is equal or less
                  than on third of your guild’s mean Player Character level,
                  your guild’s theme song will be broadcast through the zone
                  heralding the arrival of one of your members. Second, when
                  twenty or more guild members pass through an outdoor zone, en
                  route to a dungeon, the theme song will be played in the zone
                  to announce the movement of your forces. Finally, whenever
                  your guild defeats a tier seven monster (as defined in the
                  Legends reservation system), your guild’s theme song will be
                  broadcast throughout the continent upon which this creature
                  resided, declaring your erstwhile victory to all.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Your guild master simply fills out SOE’s form
                  (which you use to request, for each guild, an unused theme
                  song on your server that complies with all of the terms and
                  conditions of SOE’s guild theme song policy) and SOE will
                  charge your guild the applicable fee. SOE may discontinue this
                  service, without notice, at any time.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;Legends Premium Server guild theme songs will be
                  free. All other servers are eligible for this paid service.</p>

                  Last time we killed the Arch Lich in 17 minutes versus Zen

                  prove and decided to improve on our 17 minute time by shaving
                  off an extra 10 minutes. The Arch Lich went down like a 10
                  dollar whore - 7 minutes to get the job done, 5 min to clean
                  up, and back to work before the boss notices. Yes, 7
                  minutes...thats about 8% of the time it takes that other
                  guild. So all you rice jizzers keep making those arrows and
                  maybe someday you'll kill the AoW. In the meantime here's a

Had to be well coordinated and well timed; kudos to Otavia for handling her crew extremely well.  This is somewhat akin to fighting Shei, but on a larger scale.  So if you feel the need to "test" the High Priest, go kill Shei first.  And while I recommend this fight to all who are capable, who have the perseverance and insight to handle it, there are a few things I will warn against.  There are certain things which will not allow you to survive encounters such as these, let me name a few:  fletching arrows until your finger a bleeding stumps on the end of your hand, cybering your newest recruit, or having a Webster's dictionary crammed up your ass such that the only thing that matters to you is proper spelling.  I'd add shouting fake combat messages across the zone regarding a raid you're not even a part of, but folks who find that amusing rarely progress terribly far in the game.</font></td>

		&nbspYes, I know, first update from me in a while.  In fact, this isn't going to be much of an update.  Instead, I'd like to tell you a little story.  I'd like to tell you a little bit about my dogs.  They're greyhounds, retired racing dogs.  One in particular I'd like to describe, his name is Beau (I call him Bo-bo.)  This is Beau (it’s a bad picture, I'm sorry.)
		<br><center><img src="index_files/beau.jpg" width="500" height="375"></center>
		<br><br>
		&nbspNow, Beau is lovable, but he's one of the more neurotic dogs you'll meet anywhere.  As I type this, it is raining and we've had thunderstorms.  Beau is afraid of rain.  I don't mean he's afraid to be outside in it.  When it starts raining, he runs for the basement and shivers and quakes in the corner, panting and drooling like a dog possessed.  He's also scared of ants.  If he is lying down outside, and an ant runs across the ground in front of him, he jumps up and runs away.  (Not all greyhounds are like this, the other one will catch bees out of the air with his mouth and eat them.)  
		<br><br>
		&nbspYesterday Beau had a little accident, he threw up on the carpeting where he likes to sleep.  Being the lucky guy I am, I got to clean up his dog puke.  (Not to mention other liquid-solid presents left by the other dog.  It was one of those days.)  However, not all of the vomit was soaked up from the carpet immediately.  Beau doesn't care, he goes back to lie down.  And rolls over several times.  By the end of the evening, he has large yellow splotches on his shoulders (white fur.)  Beau is a very companionable dog, and I love him, but he can easily bear the name of stupid.
		<br><br>
		&nbspWhat does this have to do with EQ?  A lot actually, bear with me here.  Fennin Ro has a certain guild that happens to have a lot in common with that dog.  It would be unprofessional of me to sling mud at another guild, so we'll call them, for sake of argument, Zen Sect.  Yesterday, Zen Sect fought the Idol of Rallos Zek slowed, in order to spawn the AoW thinking they had a shot in hell of downing him.  I don't expect everybody to understand the significance of this, so I'll explain.  The Idol of Rallos Zek is both a trigger mob and a gauge of your guilds performance.  If you cannot kill the Idol when it is unslowed, you don't have a prayer of killing the AoW.  Slowing the Idol does nothing but take the AoW away from guilds who could actually kill him.  The Idol is the mob that your guild practices on, the mob your guild tunes its strategy on, the mob that your guild uses to ensure you can actually kill the AoW without wasting it.
		<br><br>
		&nbspMuch like my dog, Zen Sect is stupid.  For continually ignoring some of the most basic premises of EQ, Zen Sect is stupid.  For being proud of this, for blithely looking past the idiocy of their arguments that what they've done is plausible they're much like my dog in that they soil themselves.  They enjoy rolling around in their own filth and putting it on display for the world to see, reveling in it.
		<br><br>
		&nbspNow, unlike my dog, which is loved by all, Zen Sect is not.  Strangers walk up and comment on how beautiful he is and adore him.  Zen Sect is neither beautiful nor loved, they are simply dogs who soil themselves.  I had to wash my dog today, he didn't like it but he forgave me.  When is Zen Sect going to get their bath?  Is it coming soon?  Maybe.

            well, since most everything worth killing was already dead we
            figured since NToV was still up we might as well go clear to end the
            weekend. Average loot dropped. Most likely the best drop of the
            night was Onyx Gauntlets to Edroheht. Everyone played their class
            well and in the end walked away with some nice loot. The raid served
            to show that even a painful 6 hour NToV raid can be fun if people
            make it fun.&nbsp;</font></p>

            woke up Saturday, still running on adrenalin from the Arch Lich
            kill. We noticed that tree hugging ho was up in PoG so we killed her
            early on but still no essences dropped. Next we headed to Deep to
            find the Burrower was up and thought we'd better knock him out just
            in case hell froze over and he dropped a robe - he didn't but it was
            a smooth fight and kept the momentum rolling on TMO's Weekend of

            updated. In either event early Friday night TMO noticed Statue was
            up in Kael so we promptly killed him - Grats Obrae and Torlan on
            bows, Nova on
            ring, and Hena on sword. After that we figured we should put all
            those whining bitches who say TMO can't kill AL to rest so mustered
            up some firepower - even Aelucard made an appearence - and marched

            The fight lasted all of seventeen minutes and four
            or five people died to the AE at some point, but flawless
            rampage control along with incredible work by everyone else resulted
            in one dead lizard and phat lewtz for all. Naeviticus and Damlyn
            both got Shield of Auras and Tizit got a big ass two hander. One
            more mob off the TMO 'to-kill' next.&nbsp; Nice work and
            Congratulations to all.</font></p>

            regularly as well as getting all our wizards copies of Elnerick's.
            Some late night Ssra farming raids have resulted in keys for a good
            chunk of our members and Blood and Emperor are right around the
            corner. </font></p>

            Hopefully once Episode Two leaves theaters we should drop some more
            mobs. Until then, keep on rocking Fennin guys, and remember
