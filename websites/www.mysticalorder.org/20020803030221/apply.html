            all these guidelines we may not invite you for months, or even at 
            all.</FONT> 
            <P><B><FONT face=Verdana size=4 color=white>So YOU want to be TMO?</FONT></B> 
            <P><FONT face=Verdana size=3 color=white><B><I>The next step is to convince US 
            to want YOU.</I></B></FONT> 
            <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white>First, there are 2 things you should 
            know about TMO.</FONT> 
            <OL>
              <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white><B>You Will Respect Other 
              Members.<BR></B>You may not like everyone in this guild, and they 
              may not all like you. However, you will be expected to follow one 
              basic principle in all that you do in EQ: your guild comes first. 
              Be it arguments, grouping, exp, res, teleport, loot, calendar 
              issues, guild fights, or spawn "rights"... your guild members must 
              come first in your priorities. If you are in this for yourself, 
              then you are better off soloing.</FONT> 
              <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2><B>You Must Contribute to TMO's 
              Success.<BR></B>We constantly push the envelope of what has been 
              accomplished on Fennin Ro. If there's a dragon we have not slain, 
              a Plane we have not explored, or a dungeon we have not conquored 
              we will be the first guild to do it. When a new zone opens, we 
              will be the first guild to break it. In order to this you must 
              level, become a more skilled player, and show up to the majority 
              of our events. If you cannot do this then you cannot contribute to 
              our success.</FONT> </LI></OL>
            <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white>There are 2 basic factors about YOU 
            that we take into consideration when voting on your 
            application:</FONT> 
            <OL>
              <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white><B>Your Approach<BR></B>This is 
              completely subjective, but there are some people who, no matter 
              what their ability, just don't fit into The Mystical Order. When 
              you are trying to prove yourself worthy of being a member of The 
              Mystical Order, you have to realize that we are the best of the 
              best on Fennin Ro, and we will not settle for less. Basically, try 
              and be a human being. Think of going out and getting a new job, 
              and how you would act in that situation; you would wear your best 
              face, your best clothes, and you'd show off what you are good at 
              and why the hell we should hire you. If you are going to come and 
              hinder us, we don't need it. If you are going to screw around and 
              not help, we don't need that either. If you're going to whine and 
              cry and expect to get all the phat lewt, you're going to be in for 
              a wakeup call. No one can tell you to be someone you are not, so 
              be yourself, but don't expect to be accepted unless you have 
              proven to us that you are worthy to have our tag over your 
              head.</FONT> 
              <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white><B>What You Need to Make the 
              Cut<BR></B>We are a high level guild. Many people in the guild 
              believe we already have too many people, so we really have no 
              reason to invite low level people into the guild. These days, 
              anything under 55 is pushing it for new invites. Since most of our 
              main characters are 55-60, it is harder for you to contribute to 
              the guild if you are lower level than most of us. If you don't 
              like to raid, TMO probably isn't for you. We go on a lot of raids, 
              and this is something we do almost daily. If you have the 
              patience, and the time, then by all means we'd be happy to have 
              you along, as long as you can contribute.</FONT> </LI></OL>
            <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white><B>As for equipment:</B></FONT> 
            <UL>
              <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Think raid gear... shoot for 100+ 
              resists in all categories (not necessarily all the time, just for 
              specific raids). If we're going to kill Trakanon, we don't need 
              people to have 0 poison resist gear on because you're going to end 
              up dieing, and that doesn't help us at all.</FONT> 
              <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white>Dungeon Keys. Don't even think of 
              applying unless you have your Sebilis and Charsis (Howling Stones) 
              keys.</FONT> 
              <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white>We've recently made our first trip 
              into Veeshan's Peak, and we plan on heading back plenty more 
              times. If you don't know what Veeshan's Peak is, I don't think TMO 
              is for you. If you know what Veeshan's Peak is, but you haven't 
              done anything yet to get started on the quest, do so. We don't 
              want to have to hold your hand through the game, and going to 
              Veeshan's Peak is one of the most difficult things in the game. If 
              you can't prove to us that you have the initiative to at least get 
              a portion of your key done, then you'd bettter start cracking. 
              </FONT>
              <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white>When and if we guild you, we don't 
              want to guild your twink. You are joining TMO as yourself, and you 
              are to contribute. Until you have your OS, HS, and VP key, you are 
              level 58+ and you have all your necessary equipment, you should 
              not be on your twink. Don't expect anyone to be very happy if we 
              see your twink around more then you.</FONT> 
              <LI><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white>If you have approached joining The 
              Mystical Order with the idea in mind that you will be getting 
              great loot and then selling it, you have another thing coming. If 
              and when you are rewarded with loot from a guild raid, that item 
              still belongs to the guild. Usually, you will hold on to that item 
              until you recieve something better, in which case we will most 
              likely hand the item down to another member who does not have that 
              item, and who needs it. If you need to make money, and you want to 
              get your own items, then do it on your own.</FONT> </LI></UL>
            <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>When you're ready to apply, post on our

            href="http://66.196.196.167/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=3"><B>message 
            board</B></A> about yourself, what you can do for TMO, and what you 
            hope to get out of being in TMO. To even be considered you don't 
            just need people to post support... you need MANY posts of support. 
            30+ different people is a good number to shoot for.</FONT> 
            <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>DO NOT constantly message officers for 
            groups or ask officers to get people to post for your application. 
            Our officers have enough to deal with and this would probably work 
            against you.</FONT> 
            <P><FONT face=Verdana size=2 color=white>These should not be considered hard and 
            fast rules, but instead guidelines to help you decide if, when, and 
            how to apply. Even successful TMO invites usually come after weeks 
            of initiation. Get to know us, let us know you.</FONT>
