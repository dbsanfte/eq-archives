<p>	<span class="style9"> Missions<a name="Missions"></a></span></p>
<p> To start off you will need atleast indifferent faction with the respectable camp that you choose to align yourself with in order to start the progression line which leads to the alternative abilities.. This can be accomplished in a few ways. You can group with friends who are already able to get missions from the camp and upon completion will reward you with a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57209">Dark Reign Token</a>, which can then be turned into Xeib Darkskies in the Dark Reign camp, or this can be turned into Wayfarer Mercenary Limann if you are Kill on Sight or Threatingly to the Dark Reign. Reward is posative faction to Dark Reign, Lany's T'vyl and negative faction to Norrath's Keepers, and Firiona Vie. </p>
<p>Note: You must do the Dark Reign missions to recieve this, if you do a Norrath's Keepers mission you will recieve the wrong kind of token. I do not recommend turning it in, it will lower your faction with the Dark Reign and add to the faction work you have to do.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back to Top</a> </p>
<p class="style3"><span class="style14">Wayfarer Tasks</span><a name="WayfarerTasks"></a></p>
<p class="style3"><img src="Wayferer%20NPC.jpg" width="628" height="547"></p>
<p>Another Option you have available are the various tasks the Wayfarers give out. These are generally able to be soloable tasks that can raise your faction to indifferent. Once you reach indifferent you will be unable to recieve any tasks and must do missions from the Dark Reign camp.</p>
<p>Note: There are 6 Wayfarers located in the camp. Four of them give out tasks, Two are for Dark Reign and 2 are for Norrath's Keepers Tasks.The other 2 are the ones for the tokens from either camp as it is noted above in the missions section. When attempting to get a task please make sure that you are getting the task from Wayfarer Mercenary Jeryx or Wayfarer Mercenary Varien.. Attempting to complete a task from one of the other task givers will result in faction for Norrath's Keepers and will lower your Dark Reign.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back to Top</a> </p>
<p class="style3"><span class="style14">Guards</span><a name="Guards"></a></p>
<p>The last option you have available to gain that precious faction is that you can move over to the Norrath's Keepers camp on the opposite side of the Dark Reign camp, and kill there guards. However this is tedious, and the guards hit fairly hard and have alot of hit points now. They hit for about 650 maximum, Enrage, and mitigate slow. They will also leash (any guard from either side will if aggro) if it is pulled to far from its spawn point or pulled to far away without being activly aggro.</p>
<p>Once you have obtained the required faction (indifferent) you can start the series of progression quests. The time it takes you to get to indifferent is dependent on how your faction started out. Naturally a &quot;good&quot; aligned Class/Race is going to have slightly more work to join the Dark Reign then a Iksar would. Once you've obtained the faction see step 2 below.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back to Top</a></p>
<p align="center" class="style13">The First Advancement Ability (Step 2)<a name="FirstAbility"></a></p>
<p>So you have obtained your faction and your ready to begin the adventure. To start off you need to visit the Dark Reign camp. If you have yet to visit the camp it is found along the north part of lavastorm, through the middle tunnel,<img src="Commander%20Zaerr.jpg" width="156" height="325" align="right"> Left leads to Norrath's Keepers, and the far right leads to Lavaspinners Lair. The tunnel leading to the camp can be found at location 2741, -190. </p>
<p>You've found the Dark Reign camp, now where to begin. You need to locate Commander Zaerr Ty'dar. He can be found along the outter east wall, you can also easily idenfity him because he will have Dark Reign Recruiter under his name. Upon finding him and hailing him (make sure you have indifferent faction otherwise he will turn you away saying you must still prove yourself to the Dark Reign), upon hailing results in the following test.</p>
<p><img src="First%20Flag%20copy.jpg" width="560" height="146"></p>
<p>He then directs you to speak with Sirrikis who has some menail tasks for you.
  <img src="Officer%20Sirrikis.jpg" width="211" height="503" align="right">
</p>
<p class="style14">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style17">First 3 Quests</span><a name="FirstQuests"></a></p>
<p>Upon Hailing Sirrikis, who can be located to the right of the Commander will yield you the following text: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="First%20AA%20quest%20list%20copy.jpg" width="438" height="79"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He then gives you the following quests to complete.</p>
<p><img src="First%203%20Task%20list.jpg" width="884" height="313"></p>
<p>Completion of each quest task will add it to your quest log of when you completed as well as reward you with experience posative Dark Reign, Lanys T'vyl and negative Norrath's Keepers, Firiona Vie faction and 216pp 5gp, 6sp, 2cp per completion.</p>
<p>Once you have completed all 3 of the requested tasks, you must return and speak with Commander Zaerr Ty`Dar. Upon hailing him will result in the following text.</p>
<p><img src="3%20quest%20text%20first%20aa%20completion%202nd%20hail%20before%20note.jpg" width="564" height="81"></p>
<p>You must then speak with Offcer Vacax Rol'Tas. </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back to Top</a></p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style17">Have Note Will Travel Mission </span><a name="HaveNoteWillTravel"></a></p>
<p>Officer Vacax Rol'Tas can be found to the left of the Commander is. Hailing him result in the following text as well as opening the Task window.</p>
<p><img src="Officer%20Vacax%20Hail.jpg" width="560" height="40"> <img src="Officer%20Vacax%20NPC.jpg" width="203" height="410" align="right"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task Window will open up. You will have a shared task available called &quot;Have Note Will Travel&quot;. Details can be found below.<img src="Have%20Note%20Will%20Travel%20Task%20Window.jpg" width="384" height="405"> </p>
<p>This is one of the first &quot;real&quot; missions that you will complete. As soon as you have your valiant party gathered and are ready to attempt this round them up and get the task and make your way to the enterance to Tirranun's Delve in the Broodlands. The instanced zone in can be found at location +906, -1618, its a cave on the side of the hi<a href="Tirranuns%20Delve%20Map%20Minus%20Tirranuns%20lairLarge.jpg"><img src="Tirranuns%20Delve%20Map%20Minus%20Tirranuns%20lair.jpg" width="330" height="538" border="0" align="right"></a>ll towards the northeast part of the zone.</p>
<p>Once you zone in, if you have the current maps (they can be found at eq.mapfiend.net). Your map will look simular to the one posted to the side. (Clicking on it will display a larger version) </p>
<p>Note: The red/yellow dots will not appear if you have just downloaded the maps. These are additions made by me to indicate spawns. Yellow dots indicate Goblin Guard locations, and the yellow dot indicates the Goblin Taskmaster's Spawn.</p>
<p>Once you zone in you have alittle work to do. You must locate Tirranun's Letter. Naturally this is held on the Goblin Taskmaster. He will not spawn the moment you zone in. You will need to make him spawn. This is simply done by killing everything that you can. Upon each goblin's death it has a chance to emote &quot; The goblin falls before being able to sound the alarm&quot;. It took me about 4-5 emotes of that before one was finally able to &quot;alert&quot; the taskmaster which in return made him spawn. You will know the text because it will be a yellow emote and will include the following text &quot;As the Delvian falls to the ground you can hear a siren going off. Your presence has been made known. Quickly find the Goblin Task Master for the information you seek&quot;. He can be found on the map on the yellow dot. I recommend when you kill him that you kill him inside the big open room he spawns in and keep away from where the guards spawn. He is no harder then that other mobs in the zone in terms of damage, is partially slowable. The only difference is he has about 4 times the hit points of the average mob. Once he is dead you will be able to loot <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=48139">Letter from Tirranun</a>. Upon looting this your task will be updated indicateing that you must kill 9 Goblin Guards, and make your way to the enterance. Once again refer to the map above for Goblin Guard locations, they spawn 3 per area and can be mixed with the normal zone spawns. There easily mezzable so if you have some form of crowd control you should have no problem. There same as the rest of the mobs in the zone in terms if difficulty. Upon killing the 9 and makeing your way to the zone out you will have your task completed and recieve the following message:</p>
<p><img src="Tirranun%20Delve%20Mission%20Completion.jpg" width="559" height="40"> </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back to Top </a></p>
<p class="style14"><span class="style17">Completion</span><a name="Completion"></a></p>
<p>After completion of the <a href="#HaveNoteWillTravel">Have Note Will Travel mission</a>, you need to head back and speak with Commander Zaerr Ty`Dar. Upon hailing him you will recieve the text:</p>
<p><img src="First%20AA%20gained.jpg" width="563" height="107"></p>
<p>Gift of the Dark Reign description: </p>
<p><img src="First%20AA%20window%20description.jpg" width="370" height="55"></p>
<p>What it does is increase your BASE statistics (strength, agility, wisdom, intelligence, charisma, dexterity) by 10 points maximum. It will NOT increase your resists cap. Upon completion you will also be rewarded with 1 alternative advancement point.</p>
<p>Congratulations on completion of your first alternative advancement ability. You can now move onto the next step.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back to Top</a></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" class="style13">The Second Advancement Ability (Step 3)<a name="SecondAbility"></a></p>
<p>So you have completed Step  2 and now your ready to start 3. Please make sure that in order to start this you must now have atleast a faction standing of Amiably. If you do not have this level of faction please see <a href="#GainingFaction">Step 1 missions and guards</a> for ways to imrpove it.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back to Top </a></p>
<p class="style9">The start of your second ability<a name="StartOfSecondAbility" id="StartOfSecondAbility"></a></p>
<p>So you have the faction, you have everything up to here completed your ready to begin. Seek out Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar in the Dark Reign camp and Hail him. You will recieve the following text:<span class="style1"><img src="2Raid%20Recruiter.jpg" width="203" height="479" align="right"></span></p>
<p class="style1"><img src="2nd%20AA%20start.jpg" width="435" height="391"></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">Tirranun Raid <a name="Tirranun"></a></p>
<p>You will now have access to the &quot;Fanning the Flames&quot; raid event. You can recieve this from General Lereh Dirr. It involves killing the great dragon Tirranun. This is aimed for a elemental/time lev<a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=34088"></a>el raid. Loot can consist of <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71637">Ashen Blade of the Slayer</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71633">Blackened Sandals</a>, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=34088">Brimstone Spaulders</a>,<img src="2Fanning%20the%20Flames.jpg" width="284" height="105" align="right"> <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71634">Glimmering Fire Opal Band</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71632">Hands of Flame</a>, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=34630">Scorched Green Metal Visor</a>, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=34752">Smoldering Claw of Tirranun</a>.</p>
<p>Note: Tirranun does not appear to be needed in terms of completion of the progression line. </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">The Second Three Quests<a name="SecondThreeQuests" id="SecondThreeQuests"></a></p>
<p>You must now speak with Officer Sirrikis Ryktor again. Upon hailing him your task window will open up you will recieve 3 quests which are outlined below.</p>
<p class="style1"><img src="2nd%20aa%203%20quest%20intial%20hail.jpg" width="434" height="94"><img src="2nd%20AA%203%20quest%20task%20description.jpg" width="950" height="451"></p>
<p>These tasks are not to hard, generaly they can be completed solo or with a friend or two. Completeion of each one results in posative Dark Reign, Lanys T'vyl faction and lowering your Norrath's Keepers, Firiona Vie. You also will net some experience as well as 216pp 5gp 6sp 2cp per task. </p>
<p>Once you have completed the above quests head back once again and speak with Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar. Hailing him will result in the following:</p>
<p class="style1"><img src="2nd%20AA%20pre%20emoush.jpg" width="563" height="120"><img src="2Drake%20Egg%20Task%20Window.jpg" width="373" height="417" align="right"></p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must now speak with either Officer Vacax Rol'tas or Captain Aleeth Zyrv. Note: You can complete either the Drake Egg mission or Calling Emoush in either order as long as they are both completed. For the sake of this guide we'll start with Vacax. </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">Drake Egg Mission<a name="DrakeEggMission" id="DrakeEggMission"></a></p>
<p>He can be found to the left of the Commander still. Upon hailing him it will open up your task window and you will have the following mission available --------------&gt; </p>
<p>This mission involves zoneing into The Ascent instance. Upon zoneing in your task will be updated to indicate that you must recover <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=49022">a stillmoon drake egg</a>. These can be found on any mobs that are called A drake.They can spawn at various points along the mountain path. You can use invisibiltiy through this zone, just watch out for spiders they seem to be the only thing I could find other then the ocasional statue that would see through. If I recall right it took me about 5-6 drakes to get mine. Upon the completition of it your task will be updated to indicate that you must make your way back towards the enterance where you zoned in to defeat a Goblin Guard. He spawns at the exact location where you zoned into the instance. He does not hit any harder then your average mob in the zone. When he dies your task will once again be updated and you must return the stillmoon drake egg you looted to Celrak Blightblood. He can be found near the tunnel exit leading out of the Dark Reign camp towards the Broodlands zone. Hes really hard to miss. Upon turning in the stillmoon drake egg you will recieve the following task completion message.</p>
<p class="style1"><img src="2drake%20egg%20completion.jpg" width="560" height="67"><img src="2Cerick%20Blightblood.jpg" width="202" height="291" align="right"></p>
<p>Note: You might not be sent back to Commander Zaerr Ty'dar UNTIL you complete emoush. I completed the Emoush event first then did the Drake Eggs so the above &quot;Congratulations! Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar at the Dark Reign Outpost wants to speak with you now.&quot; might not be given until you complete the Emoush event.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p><span class="style9">Calling Emoush Event <a name="Emoush"></a></span><span class="style1 style2"><span class="style1"><img src="2Calling%20Emoush%20task%20Window.jpg" width="374" height="416" align="right"></span></span></p>
<p class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
<p>So your ready to try the first &quot;event&quot; encounter now. In order to recieve this task you must speak with Captain Aleeth Zyrv. He can be found to the left of where Officer Vacax Rol'Tas spawns and to the right of where Celrak Blightbrood spawns on the Northeast wall in the Dark Reign camp. Upon hailing him your task window will open up you will have the following event available.</p>
<p>This event is a 24 player limit. Depending on the group make up and the level and gear ranges 2-3 groups would be a fairly accurate number to what it takes to complete. Once you have your party gathered and recieve the task make your way to Tirranun's Delve again. The zone in can be found in the Broodlands on the northeast section of the zone at location +906, -1618. You can identify the zone in from the black cave looking area on the side of the hill. Once your task will be updated once again and you will be required to Confront Emoush. Emoush can be found on the north most section of the map. You can view the spawn locations by refering to the map to the side.</p>
<p><a href="2Tirranuns%20Delve%20Map%20EmoushL.jpg"><img src="2Tirranuns%20Delve%20Map%20Emoush.jpg" width="330" height="538" border="0" align="right"></a></p>
<p>The yellow dot represents Emoush's Spawn point. The red dots represent his guards spawn point. Upon entering the main room area your task will close and you will be unable to invite or remove any players from your task. I suggest that you make any adjustments you need and keep your raid back out of the main room until you are certain you are ready. Once you are ready move your raid into the main room area to the edge of the sand area is where we pulled to. This is not to difficult of an encounter. He is surrounded by 3 guards named  Mystic Shiflor, Mystic Griknok, and Mystic Braggle. These guards hit for roughly 1020 or so and were able to be pulled single very easily with no effort. </p>
<p>The idea of this encounter is that you need to have all 3 of his guards dead in order for Emoush the Destroyer to be attackable. There are a few ways you can go about doing this, the method you choose is comletly up to you. You can tank each one and bring each one down to low hit points then finish off all 3 one after another or you can pull one after another as soon as you can and kill each one. Only once they are all dead will you be able to attack Emoush the Destroyer. Note: The guards will respawn roughly 3mins after being killed so if they respawn in the middle of killing Emoush you will need to defeat all the guards again in order to attack. If a guard respawns Emoush will be unattackable and will move back to his original spawn point until all are dead then he will be attackable. Emoush hits for aproximitly 1200 damage, is slowable. He also has an area effect spell that is called Rumbling Stone. This will do 1000 damage, and a 1.0 second stun if it lands. You need to make sure you have every resist of yours buffed since it is a Prismatic Resist check with a -350 adjustment. What this means is that if you add all your resists together, then divide them by 5 that will equel your average then minus the -350 adjustment will equel the resists your actually useing to resist it with. It did not seem to bad, but with a raid of very low &quot;average&quot; resists it could be a challenge. The Rumbling Stone will go off every 1 min as long as you have engaged or pulled 1 of his guards. He will gain strength (attack/hit points) over the course of the duration you are engaged as well as regen a decent amount if you have to kill goblins mid fight. Once he is dead you will recieve the following task completion message.</p>
<p><img src="2Emoush%20Task%20Completion.jpg" width="563" height="40"></p>
<p>Upon looting emoush you will recieve 6 <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57202">Glowing Stone Fragments</a>, and will recieve 1 item drop that can consist of a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71563">Lava Crystal Sceptre </a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71560">Band of Ashen Rain</a>, or <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71562">Ring of Living Malachite</a>. </p>
<p>Note: There are only 6 orbs that drop. This is required for BOTH good or evil progression. So if you have friends who have joined you that are going for Norrath's Keepers faction that wish to loot this they can loot it. There is no requirement to looting them. If you require more then 6 you will have to do the event multiple times. Once completed you will also recieve a 3 day or so lockout timer so that anyone that was with you in the event will not be able to do the event again for that time.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">Completion<a name="SecondCompletion" id="SecondCompletion"></a></p>
<p>Once you have looted your orb, you must head back to the Dark Reign camp and show your proof of completion to Commander Zaerr Ty'Darr as proof you have completed your task. Upon turning the orb in you will recieve the following text.</p>

<p>You now have the option of going after Volkara in Tirranun's Delve or doing the Gilded Scroll mission. Volkara is a 42 person max event. For the sake of all things I'll explain the Gilded Scroll mission first.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">Gilded Scroll Mission<a name="GildedScrollMission"></a></p>
<p>Seek out Vaxax Rol'Tas yet again. He can still be found to the <img src="3Gilded%20Scroll%20Mission.jpg" width="373" height="414" align="right">left of the Commander. Hailing him will open up your task window and you will have the option to select the Gilded Scroll mission. Select the Gilded Scroll mission which can be detailed to the right. Make your way now to the Thundercrest Isles instance. If you have problems with locateing the enterance it can be found at location 520, 1221. Both posative. Its the northwest corner, its a small portal pad between a circle of pillars.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon zoneing in your task will be updated to indicate you must loot 1 scroll. You must kill anything that is spawned. These mobs seem to range around level 67-69 or so. If you have a enchanter or bard they will need to have there Omens of War spells. Average hits on things were about 900 so it was equel to roughly a hard LDON. Everything you kill will have a chance to drop &quot;a scroll&quot;, but only one of them is truely what you need. When you loot a scroll you will recieve a emote along the lines of &quot;As you take the scroll from the corpse, magical runes appear on the parchment&quot; now it will change to a different scroll with a different name. There is no way to tell which is which, until you loot. provided you loot the wrong scroll you could have a number of different area effect spells go off. I only had 2 that managed to go off while doing mine, one was heatwave which is a 1500 DD, and one that was a massive knockback. I do not recall the name on the knockback but it was a very large one. I went through clearing roughly half to 3/4 of the zone before I managed to get the right scroll. You will know the right scroll by when you loot your task will be updated and it will turn into a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=81885">Gilded Scroll of Earth Rending</a>. </p>
<p>Your task should be updated by now and you must kill Noble Kirn Scholar. He will most likely not be up right away. I had to clear almost the whole zone until he spawned. It might just be you need to have the whole temple area clear I don't know for sure. You can tell when he spawns because you will recieve the following <img src="3Daelynn%20Spiritshadow.jpg" width="103" height="291" border="0" align="right">emote.</p>
<p><img src="3Kirn%20Emote.jpg" width="558" height="32"> </p>
<p>He was not a hard fight, about 1030 max hit was unslowable. He died pretty easily. Once he is dead your task will be updated and you must deliver the Gilded Scroll of Earth Rending to Daleynn Spiritshadow in Lavastorm Mountains. She can be found around the campfire in the middle of the camp.</p>
<p>Upon turning in the Gilded Scroll you will recieve the following completion.</p>

<p class="style9">Volkara Event <a name="Volkara"></a></p>
<p>So, you want to try Volkara next eh? This starts out with Captain Aleeth Zyrv. Who can be found to the left of Officer Vacax Rol'Tas. Upon hailing your task window will open up and you will have Volkara's Bite available.<img src="3Volkara%20Task%20Window.jpg" width="373" height="500" align="right"> This is a 42 person max event. The very first time I completed it was with about 30 people with a few boxed players of Tacvi level equipment. Once you have your raid gathered and you have the task its time to head to the zone. This fight is located in the Lavaspinners Lair instance. Upon zoneing in you will zone into the spider section of the zone. Volkara is located in the southeast section as detailed on the map below inidicated by the red dot. Its very easy to find there will be nothing but Volkara up. Once you enter the big room where he is located your task will close so make sure your raid does not wonder around down there unless your set and ready. Once you get down there you have options how to handle the fight. Currently theres a few different ways you can handle it which I will detail below. </p>
<p>First off what you need to know about Volkara. He is not rooted so he can be pulled, rampages (fake possably flurry instead), partially slowable, hits for double 1650 or so and missed fairly often. 1 cleric on CH was more then enough to keep up. He also has an area effect spell called Volkara's Bite. This is a 300 range area effect spell that will do 2000hp of DD damage, 200 damage per tick, 100 endurance per tick, and 100 mana per tick with a poison count of 25. This is poison based, with a -300 resist check and will go off every 1 min and will last 5 mins when it lands. Make sure you hare buffing your raid fully with posion resists. With a bard this was easily resisted. I would have people lined up to cure your clerics and mana users due to the mana drain effect first. Utilizeing your mass group heals if required. We tanked him to the right of the big ramp leading up to him useing the corner.</p>
<p>Now the fun part. Once you have him pulled or tanked wherever you choose. Every 20% life that he loses he will spawn &quot;eggs&quot; in the center of the main platform where he spawned. Theres a few different ways like I said to deal with this. You can do what we initially did and get all your damage class's to get on them and kill them one after another as soon as you can. They hit for about 4-500 max, and have very low hit points. However if you dont kill fast enough sometimes an egg will &quot;burts&quot; and baby spiders will pop out. These baby spiders can be from 2-4 per egg &quot;burst&quot; and they hit for about 500 and do not summon, are snareable, very low MR and flurry. Dosent sound like much I know. But when you have multiple eggs &quot;burts&quot; you can get a very very large number of spiders. The way we intially delt with them was to kill the spiders when they spawned, then get back on Volkara. Volkara dosent have to many hit points so I would watch if you use this way as to how much damage your doing. </p>
<p>The other way that you can deal with the baby spiders is to assign kite groups to get on them when they spawn and snare and kite them around while you maximize your damage on Volkara. They do not despawn however once Volkara dies so you could end up haveing to kill alot of spiders. You also run more of a risk of someone messing up and haveing your raid wiped out with them. Its completly your choice how you deal with them.</p>
<p>The last way, and one that most seem to currently use that I expect to see a fix to is that since Volkara is not rooted you can pull her out of the main room and up as far as you want through the zone. This makes it so that when the baby spiders spawn they do not aggro anyone since the will not assist Volkara. This lets you kill her completly out of range of any and all of the baby spiders and not have to worry about them. Although I have heard a few peopel mention that once she was dead the baby spiders all of a sudden showed up. But this seems to be one of the more common ways people seem to deal with the event currently. </p>
<p>Once Volkara is dead and you have looted you will find 9 <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57206">Lava Spider Spinners</a>, as well as 2 various loots that can consist of <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71608">Ring of Unsung Legends</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71607">Ancient Feline Leggings</a>. </p>
<p>Once you have your Spinner head on back the Dark Reign camp and speak with Commander Zaerr Ty'dar again. You need to turn into him you Lava Spider Spinner and you will recieve the following text and character flag.</p>

<p class="style9">Test of Perseverance Mission <a name="TestOfPerseverance"></a></p>
<p>Ready to do the final task that Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar has asked of you now. Head on over and speak with Captain Aleeth Zyrv, upon hailing your task window will open up again and you will have the &quot;Test of Perseverance&quot; event available. This is a 24 maximum person event and takes place in Stillmoon.</p>
<p>You will need roughly 2-3 groups on average to complete this. Once you have your party gathered and are ready accept the task and make your way to the Stillmoon instance in the Broodlands. The instance zone can easily be found at location 1030, 54 both posative. Its straight out and to the left alittle if you are comeing out of the enterance temple area of Stillmoon. </p>
<p>Once you zone in your task will be updated. You now have to speak with Osashi. He is found straight from where you zone in near the bell. Be warned though once you approach him your task will close and you will be unable to invite or remove anyone so make sure you are ready. Upon hailing him you will recieve the following text.</p>
<p><img src="3Osashi%20dialog.jpg" width="559" height="79"> </p>
<p>Telling him ready will start the event. He will despawn and you will have 4 Goblin Guards that will spawn. They spawn around the bell area in a circle one on each side. They can be split but if you leave any of them unaggro for to long they will &quot;ring the bell&quot; and the event will be over. The way I did it was bring a enchanter to keep 3 of them locked down while we killed one. These hit for roughly 1200 damage and are partially slowable with not to many hp. Once one dies it will spawn another near the bell where he was originally from. It will go through 4-5 until it will spawn spawning, then you move onto the next one. I'm unsure if its a set amount of these that need to be killed or if it is just a matter of picking the right one, but after you kill each one theres a chance that A Stillmoon warlord will spawn. (once you started the event your task was updated to indicate this is what you needed to slay). We had a enchanter control the other goblins while we did the Goblin Guards then while we did the Warlord. Warlord hits for about 1250, and has area effect rampage. However it did not seem like he rampaged alot. Was easily slowable. Once he is dead you recieve the following message. Note: Goblin Guards will not despawn when he dies you must finish them off. </p>
<p><img src="3Warlord%20death.jpg" width="563" height="40"></p>

<p><img src="4First%20Hail.jpg" width="560" height="121" /> </p>
<p>You now can speak with Captain Aleeth Zyrv who will open up your task window and will give you the selection of being able to participate in Guardian of the Sands, or Goblin Dojo. I will explain the Guardian of the Sands task first.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">Guardian of the Sands Event <a name="GuardianOfTheSands"></a> </p>
<p><img src="4Guardian%20of%20Sands%20Task%20Description.jpg" width="375" height="485" align="right" /></p>
<p>So your ready to try the Guardian of the Sands event. This event starts out by hailing Captain Aleeth Zyrv who will open your task window and give you the options of selecting the correct mission. This event is a 42 player maximum event. I suggest that when you gather your raid you make sure you have some good tanks, some very good enchanters, and good healing. I would aim more towards getting a good group of enchanters 2-3 decently geared would most likely suffice, the rest of your raid can be made up of the standard class's of dps etc. Once you have your raid set accept the mission and you will need to zone into the Stillmoon Instance. You can find this instance at location 1030, 54 both posative numbers, its a teleporter pad.</p>
<p>Once you zone in your task will get updated to indicate that you must confromt Shogurei, Guardian of the Sands. It's alot easier then it sounds. There is normal spawns up through the zone. If you look at the map I have included off to the side so you can see what I am talking about. (Clicking the map will display a larger version) I have marked Shogurei, Guardian of the Sands as the yellow dot that can be located in the top right. I have also enclosed that top right section in a green box. This box indicates where you have a very large amount of goblins. These goblins will respawn within seconds of being killed and will spawn at the various red dots I have marked depending which section your in. The first big room being one section, Shogurei's area being another. </p>
<p><a href="4Stillmoon%20TempleL.jpg"><img src="4Stillmoon%20Temple.jpg" width="330" height="266" border="0" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There are static spawned mobs on the way up to the northeast corner. Just kill them as you go. These are the same as any normal trash mob. Once you get up to the green section I marked you have a few options since the Goblins once dead will respawn within seconds. </p>
<p>The method that I used when I completed it was to move in and have the enchanters get the adds under control then we would move up to the next corner and we would pull the ones we had aggro on to that point kill them then quickly move to the next section. Between the 2 large room is a camp fire area that has 4 Goblins around a fire. These are static and will not respawn. Just continue to move a distance, pull the ones you have on aggro kill them then quickly move. Its very easily to get a very large amount of adds in a very short time, a good set of enchanters can make pretty good work of controling everything. These all hit for your normal trash mobs. Once you make it to Shoguri's section you can either let your enchanters control all the adds and pull Shoguri to you, or you can clear along the west wall and get your raid bunched on that side, then pull Shoguri and use the corner. When I did it we only had 1 enchanter and by the time we reached that point we were starting to get a few to many adds so I promptly pulled Shoguri and we got the raid on it.</p>
<p>Shoguri now hits for aprox. 1900 damage, Flurry's, has a single target rampage and will have an area effect spell called Explosion of Sand. This is a 1500 DD, 30% melee slow, and 30% snare. It also has a knockback effect is Magic based and has a -250 resist check. The range on it is 500. He did not seem to have to many hit points. We just burned him down while adds were controled by enchanters and tanks. Once he is dead you can finish off the goblins that your enchanters had locked down and they will no longer spawn.</p>
<p>You will also recieve a Dark Reign Faction orb and 9 Crystals upon completion of the task. </p>
<p>Upon looting you will recieve 9 <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57207">Quintessence of Sand</a>, You will also recieve 2 loot drops that can include <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=34890">Cape of Serenity</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71616">Wrapped Glass Shard</a>, and <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71617">Polished Sunsword</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have your Quintessence of Sand you can now head back to Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar and turn it in and recieve the following text.</p>
<p><img src="4Sand%20Turn%20in.jpg" width="561" height="54" /> </p>
<p>Note: This text might be slightly different depending if you had completed the Goblin Dojo event first.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">Goblin Dojo Event <a name="GoblinDojo"></a></p>
<p>Your ready to begin the next adventure that Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar has requested you complete in order to prove yourself.</p>
<p>You can find this event from Captain Aleeh Zyrv. Upon hailing your task w<img src="4Goblin%20Dojo%20Task%20Desc.jpg" width="375" height="451" align="right" />indow will open up and you will have the option to select the Goblin Dojo task. This task is a 24 person maximum event. I would suggest that you bring a well rounded set of people to help you. I would bring atleast atleast 3-5 decently geared time equivelent tanks. You will also need to bring 4-5 healers, a shaman or 2 and a enchanter. The rest can be made up of various dps class's and what not.</p>
<p>Once you have your raid gathered hail Captain Aleeh Zyrv and accept the Goblin Dojo event. The details of the event can be found off to the side. Once you have accepted it have your raid make there way to the Stillmoon instance. This can be found at location 1030, 54 both posative, it is a teleporter pad. Once you zone in your task will be updated to indicate that you must enter the Dojo.</p>
<p>You need to make sure that your raid is fully ready before entering. Once you have your entire raid into the dojo doors your task will be updated to indicate you must survive the Stormreach Challenge. The Dojo doors will also lock preventing you from leaveing the area. When this happens you will recieve the following text (sorry no screenshot yet).</p>
<p>The Storm Reach Sensei says, 'Good, you have decided to meet the challenge. I will not bore you with unworthy tales of our training methods or our meager accomplishments, certainly your own deeds far outshine our own. We are but meager servants to the Strom Mistress, Yar`Lir, and are of little consequence. We have been asked to test you and, certainly, ourselves in a battle to the death. The residents of this place are away at tasks beyond those such as we, and for a short while we have this room to ourselves. We must finish our contest before they return, and so there is little time for pleasantries.'<br />
  <br />
The Storm Reach Sensei says, 'A winner will be declared if they are the only combatants alive in this room. Your first challenge will be to defeat the Disciples of The Five Elements. Certainly they will be easily defeated by such mighty beings, but it is within their hearts to try. Your battle will begin in one minute. Prepare yourselves.'</p>
<p>The various Disciples of Earth, Metal, Fire, Wood, and Water will now move from the sides of the Dojo to infront of the Sensei. Shortly after they reach there location they will all emote various emotes which I have included below.</p>
<p>In a clear, ringing voice, The Disciple of Metal says, 'Please forgive my poor humor, but I am very eager to test your mettle.'<br />
  The Disciple of Earth rumbles, 'When we have defeated you, I shall see that your corpses rot in the soil as is proper.'<br />
  The Disciple of Fire shouts, 'I make no apologies. I shall burn your hearts out!'<br />
  The Disciple of Water says, 'Ah, yes. You must forgive Fire, for he cares little for pleasantries. It is part of his charm. You most certainly will be worthy opponents. I am honored to face you.'<br />
  The Disciple of Wood says, 'May our efforts here earn favor with those that watch over us all.'<br /> 
</p>
<p>They will very soon after emoteing aggro you and try to kill you. These all will need to be off tanked and can be targeted before they actually aggro. They all hit for roughly 1000 to 1200 damage and have various area effect spells. </p>
<p>Disciple of Water will cast Mists of Enlightement which is a cold based -275 resist area effect spell that will decrease your attack speed by 20%, decrease your hit points by 250 per tick, decrease your AC by 450, decrease your mana by 100 per tick. It is also 18 curse counters so I would suggest that you have someone that can cure this from your various clerics and mana users first before you do so on your melee. </p>
<p>Disciple of Fire will attempt to cast an area effect spell of Nova Inferno. This is a 2000 hit point DD, that is fire based with a -350 resist check. Just make sure you have your Fire resist buffed up before you start. He will also Rampage. </p>
<p>Disciple of Eath will have a single target process effect called Cumbling Blow that is a 2.00 second stun and a 175hp DD and is magic based.</p>
<p>Once you have them 5 dead you will get the following emote.</p>
<p>The Storm Reach Sensei says, 'Congratulations! You have defeated the Disciples of the Five Elements. You have proven yourself worthy to face the Four Emotions. They have mastered their emotions and from them they gain strength. Each has become a conduit for the emotions of our kind, a paradigm, if you will. Certainly you shall defeat them, for you are the champions of your people and they are slaves. We shall begin again in two minutes. Rest and consult with each other, if you have need.'</p>
<p>You will now see that there will be 4 more goblins moveing to the Sensei platform. These are alittle harder then the previous one and will range up to a maximum hit of about 1500. These will emote the following.</p>
<p>  The Master of Rage shouts, 'I hate you!  I will rend you into bite-sized chunks of flesh and feed them to the puma!' Rage's face darkens with blood and flecks of spittle fly from his mouth as he pants and stares at his enemies.<br />
  The Master of Deceit smiles broadly. 'You certainly will find Rage difficult to stop.  I see it boiling up inside many of you. Allow it to take over, and Rage will ruin you.'<br />
  The Master of Doubt mutters, 'I. . .  You. . . ' he sighs, 'I do not know what will happen next.  I see the same misgiving in some of you.  Could it be that you are like me?  No, that seems unlikely.'<br />
  The Master of Contentment drawls, 'Ah!  I am pleased to meet you all.  This is a fine challenge for us, is it not?  I find this sort of exercise invigorating, though rarely do I find invigoration to be a good thing.'<br />
</p>
<p>These can once again be pretargeted and will aggro as soon as your 2 min window is up. These all have small abilities as well.</p>
<p>Master of Rage will have Area Effect Rampage.</p>
<p>Master of Doubt will attempt to cast an area effect spell called Doubt. This is a 300 attack debuff, 200 strength, 200 charisma, and is 30 curse counters. It is a Chromatic resist with a -225 resist check. He also has a melee process that is called Mental Discord which will reduce the mana pool by -450 of the person he is currently aggro on. </p>
<p>Master of Deceit is naturally a rouge and will try to use his various abilities such as backstab. He will also at times &quot;disappear&quot; and will move to a different place in the Dojo.</p>
<p>Once you have defeated the 4 of them you will recieve another emote.</p>
<p> The Storm Reach Sensei says, 'Well Done.  It is rare that an opponent is able to defeat the goblin Emotions.  Your next test will be greater, I fear.  You must face our three Animals.  These are grandmasters of our arts and have never suffered defeat against opponents outside of these grand islands of the sky.  You look weary.  You shall have three minutes to prepare for the next contest.</p>
<p>You now have 3 mins to regenerate your mana and hit points. These will not emote but will move to the center platform near Sensei. They are Grandmaster Beatle, Grandmaster Puma, and Grandmaster Snake. I do not recall what they all hit for but it will be alittle harder then the last set. I would estimate then hitting for about 1400-1500 as well.</p>
<p>Grandmaster Beatle will use a Whirling Beetle Strike which is a 600 hit point DD along with a 2.00 second stun. With a prismatic (average) resist with a resist check of -225. He will also Rampage. </p>
<p>Grandmaster Snake will use a Venomed Mist area effect that is a -50 mana per tick -500 hit points per tick and is 36 poison counters. It is posion based and has a resist check of -300. </p>
<p>Grandmaster Puma will attack fast and also flurry. <br />
</p>
<p>Once you have defeated the 3 you will recieve yet another emote.</p>
<p> The Storm Reach Sensei says, 'Amazing, simply amazing!  Never before have our grandmasters been defeated by anyone other than your next opponents.  Prepare yourself, for next you must face Silk and Steel.  You have four minutes to prepare, use those minutes wisely.'</p>
<p>You now have 4 minutes to rest up and get ready to defeat Silk and Steel who will also make there way towards the middle Sensei platform. They will both emote the following. </p>
<p> Steel looks at each of you in turn, his cold eyes taking in every detail. 'Individually, you are flawed. I see rust. I see cracks. Weakness is abundant in you. I shall exploit that weakness and shatter you one at a time.'<br />
  In a voice more fluent and soft than any you've heard a goblin use, Silk says, 'Forgive my brother. He has a keen mind but a blunt mouth. We look forward to this test of our skills. Thank you for honoring us by accepting the challenge.'<br />
</p>
<p>Once they attack you they both have there own abilities once again as the last waves did. They both will hit for roughly 1500 damage and will &quot;switch&quot; there aggro lists at one point so your tanks will be switched around on opposite ones. It didn't seem to bad. </p>
<p>Steel will area effect rampage and will mitigate melee attacks </p>
<p>Silk will Flurry  and has VERY high resists. </p>
<p>Once they are both dead you will recieve the following emotes and text. </p>
<p><img src="4Sensei%20Emotes.jpg" width="559" height="181" /></p>
<p>You must now defeat the Storm Reach Sensei. He has a single target rampage, hits for 2000 damage and is slowable. He can also stun the tank for a fairly long time. He was over all pretty easy if you can get to him. Once he is dead you recieve the following text and emote.</p>
<p><img src="4Sensei%20Death.jpg" width="458" height="53" /> </p>
<p><img src="4Kilt%20of%20the%20north%20winds.jpg" width="388" height="160" align="right"></p>
<p align="left">Upon looting there will be 6 <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57204">Meditation Stone</a>, and one loot drop that can include Kilt of the North Winds. <br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you have your Meditation Stone you can return and speak with Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar. Upon the turn in of your Meditation Stone you will recieve the following text.</p>
<p><img src="4Yarlir%20Pretext.jpg" width="559" height="294" /></p>
<p>Note: This text might be different depending if you did the Goblin Dojo first or if you did Shoguri. I did Shoguri first.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">Yar'lir Raid <a name="Yarlir"></a></p>
<p>Note: You must have completed both the <a href="#GoblinDojo">Goblin Dojo</a> and <a href="#GuardianOfTheSands">Guardian of the Sands</a> before you will have access to the Yar'lir raid. </p>
<p>You must now face the mighty dragon that rests in Thundercrest. You can recieve this event from General Lereh Dirr. Upon hailing your task window will open and you will have the option of selecting the mission &quot;An End to the Storms&quot;. This will require 54 very well equiped players of Tacvi/Anguish/MPG quality. I will not spoil the encounter being as that completion of this not only will yeild you the next part of progression but will also open up your server access to The Accursed Nest if it has not been already.</p>
<p>Once you have Yar'lir dead you will recieve the following text.</p>
<p><img src="4yarlir%20text%20completion.jpg" width="559" height="73" /> </p>
<p>As I stated above this also will open up your server to The Accursed Nest which is the last zone of the Dragons of Norrath expansion. This will also allow you to obtain single group missions from Pericolo L'Morte. The Nest is slightly harder in terms if difficult then Riftseekers mob and provides moderatly better experience provided your group can handle 1300 or so hitting mobs, a good tank is required.</p>
<p>Upon looting Yar'lir you will recieve 9 <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57200">Yar'lir's Fang</a>, this can include 3 loot drops which can include <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?db=item=71659">Crystallized Glass Staff</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71661">Crescent Palemoon</a>, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71660">Eye of Yar'Lir</a>.</p>

<p>This does excactly what the description states. To what extent I can't say. I do know as far as critical process's on my weapons I noticed a very good increase. I have yet to actually look at how much it increased my actual melee criticals.</p>
<p>Congratulations on completion of the 4th AA. One left to go! Continue onto the next step. </p>

<p>Finished Yar'lir, got access to The Accursed Nest and you still want to progress. In order to start the next line of progression you will need to make sure you have the appropriate faction that is required. When I finished this part of the progresson I had very high Warmly faction. If you do not have the required faction the Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar will not speak with you. Please see step 1 in regards to faction if you need ways of improveing it.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top </a></p>
<p class="style9">The Start of your Fifth and Final Ability<a name="StartOfFifthAbility"></a></p>
<p>You now have the required faction. Thats half the battle right there. Upon completion of your 4th advancement ability you can hail Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar in the Dark Reign camp and you will recieve the following text.</p>
<p><img src="5Start%20initial%20hail.jpg" width="563" height="120" /> </p>
<p>You now have the options of accepting a 6 person mission that will take place in The Nest, or you may accept a 24 person event which will also take place in The Nest. These can be gotten from there respected task givers Officer Vacax Rol'Tas for the group version and Captain Aleeth Zyrv. I will explain the 24 person event first.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">The Curse of the Ju'rek Event <a name="Jurek"></a></p>
<p>So you've decided to take on the The Curse of the Ju'rek 24 person event. You <img src="5Curse%20of%20Jurak%20Task%20Description.jpg" width="374" height="420" align="right" />can find this event from Captain Aleeth Zyrv who will make it available to you once you have beaten Yar'Lir along with the appropriate faction. Upon hailing Aleeth your task window will open up and you can accept the mission. This event is geared for a 24 player limit maximum. I would suggest that you bring atleast 1 bard for resists, 1-2 enchanters, atleast 1 shaman, and a well equiped tank. </p>
<p>Now that you have the raid ready. Accept the mission from Captain Aleeth Zyrv. You will now need to zone into The Accursed Nest. You can find the instanced zone in at location -532, -1266. It can easily be reached as you exit the Lavastorm/Broodlands connection tunnel you can go straight out from the caves in the Broodlands and alittle to the right, there you should be able to see a ruined pillar type structure that is supposed to be a dragon with the small teleporter pad in the centetunnel you can go straight out from the caves in the Broodlands and alittle to the right, there you should be able to see a ruined pillar type structure that is supposed to be a dragon with the small teleporter pad in the center.</p>
<p>Once you have zone in your task will be updated to indicate that you must find and confront Ju`rek the Corrupted. I have included a map below and to the side that details the exact position in which you can locate him. Looking at the map he can be detailed by the bright yellow dot. You can click the map for a larger version.</p>
<p><a href="ThenestmapLarge.jpg"><img src="5Thenestmap.jpg" width="330" height="274" border="0" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Now once you zone in. Theres very minimal clearing. I believe we cleared roughly 6 trash mobs that it took to get to him, and 3 or so that he had in his room. These are just normal average mobs nothing to big. Once you reach his room your task should be updated to indicate that you must kill him.</p>
<p>Now for the fight details. Ju`rek the Corrupted hits for aprox 1940 damage, was slowable and didn't seem to bad far as melee damage. Now his AE's were the other story. The first time we went at him we got him to about 30% before we were taken over. He has 2 different abilities he use's. The first is Decaying Stench. This is a 1800 hit point per tick damage over time, and is 45 disease counters. It is disease based -600 resist check and is 100 range. The other is Ju'Ok's Cry. This is a 1500 DD and a 10.00 second stun. Posion based -550 resist check and is a recast of 60.</p>
<p>The best way we found to avoid them or attempt to was to maximize your resists. A shaman and bard can help greatly since they both specialize in resist buffs of both kinds. We used a paladin to DA in ahead of the raid and pull him over on the side near the wall where we tanked. Melee could get on the side/back while the tank used the wall as corner type area and keep it positioned in one area. This allows your casters and clerics to maximize there range without haveing to worry to much. The fight lasted 2:24 seconds according to my parse of the fight from the time we engaged. He has extreamly low hit points I would estimate in the 800k range at most. The other fun part about the fight is that every 20% I think it was he can spawn 2 adds. These are controlable with a enchanter and hit for a maximum of 837 and cast Freezing Breath. This is a Cold based area effect spell with a 200 range and a -150 resist adjust and will do 750 DD and a 70% melee slow. The best bet is to try to get your raid more caster/range oriented for damage because of this. We just burned Ju'rek down while we had enchanters/bards keeping the adds occupied since his hit points were so low and the fact that we wanted to have him dead before he could cast Decaying Stench again. Once he is dead you can kill the various adds or they despawn eventually if you wiped.</p>
<p>Once he is dead you will recieve the following text and crystals.</p>
<p>Your task 'The Curse of Ju`rek' has been updated.<br />
  He has been slain. You found nothing? How worthless.<br />
You have gained 18 Ebon Crystals.</p>
<p>Upon looting you will recieve 6 <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=57205">Diseased Wing Fragment</a>, and 1 loot drop which will be of Quarm level quality and can include <a href="http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=34900">Hammer of the Last Clutch</a>, and <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71590">Dark-Touched Mantle</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>Once you have your Diseased Wing Fragment you can head back to Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar and turn it in. You will recieve the following text.</p>
<p><img src="5Diseased%20Wing%20Turn%20in%20Text.jpg" width="564" height="54" /> </p>
<p>Note: This text might be different pending if you chose do to do the Rival Party mission first.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Index">Back To Top</a> </p>
<p class="style9">Rival Party Mission <a name="RivalPartyMission"></a></p>
<p>Now your ready to begin the Rival Party mission. This mission is a 3-6 person mission that takes<img src="5Rival%20Party%20Task%20Description.jpg" width="372" height="477" align="right" /> place in The Accursed Nest. You can recieve this mission by speaking with Officer Vacax Rol'Tas. You should be able to accept the &quot;Rivail Party&quot; mission from there. Once you have accepted it you can head to the instance which can be found in the Broodlands. </p>
<p>This instance was slightly harder to find then most. Once you know where it is though its pretty easy. I suggest that you take note of it since you will be useing it later on. You can find this zone in to the far west of the Broodlands in the forest area. To reach it though you must go to the northwest portion of the zone where you will find a small valley between the hills that leads back to the dragon statue. The location of the valley can be found at location -259, 962. Once you reach the valley section you can follow it back to the dragon statue which holds the teleporter pad inside at location -881, 1624. </p>
<p>Once you reach the instance and zone in your task will be updated to indicate that you must kill Drogorus of Norrath`s Keepers, Vincent of Norrath`s Keepers, Syllan of Norrath`s Keepers, Corgoth of Norrath`s Keepers. These are level 70 mobs and were very very easy compaired to the normal mobs in this zone. The normal mobs in this zone you can expect to hit for 1200-1350 damage and be slightly harder then your normal Riftseekers. The experience here is a good deal better though considering the difficulty. You can see on the map I have included below as to where these 4 spawn. They hit for roughly <a href="ThenestmapRivalPartyLarge.jpg"><img src="5Thenestmaprival.jpg" width="330" height="274" border="0" align="right" /></a>900 damage each. You can see where they are on the map by the bright green dot indication. Clicking the map will display a larger version. </p>
<p>Once you have killed the 4 of them you must collect 6 <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=86005">Egg of a Saved Clutch</a>. This proved to be the real challenge when I completed this section. The Eggs appear to be random drops from any creature in the zone. They just seem to be extreamly rare, or we just had some extreamly bad luck on looting. We managed to kill the 4 Norrath's Keeper's within about an hour of accepting the task (took a few of the group 30 mins to find the zone in). The other 2 1/2 hours we spend in the zone after that was spent finding the eggs. My experience they seem to be much more common off the stone golem models then anything else. We did however have moderatly decent lucky on the far west portion of the zone where the various drake models were. The only thing that kept our group from going insane other then the fact it was 3am when I dragged them into it is the fact that it was really good experience. I just hope that you have better luck then I did in collecting them.</p>
<p>Once you have looted the 6 eggs your task will be updated to indicate that you must return one of them to Pericolo L'Morte. She can be found in the Dark Reign camp on the northeast section surrounding the camp fire. Turning the egg into her will result in a character flag for your whole party as well as the following text.</p>
<p><img src="5Egg%20turn%20in%20text.jpg" width="560" height="79" /></p>
<p>Note: This message could be different depending if you completed the Rival Party mission prior to Ju'Rek.</p>
<p>Upon completion of Ju'Rek and the Rival Party missions you will be able to recieve the following text from Commander Zaerr Ty'Dar.</p>
<p><img src="5Vishitmar%20Flag.jpg" width="552" height="158" /> </p>
<p>You will now have access to Vishimtar The Fallen raid task which can be accepted from General Lereh Dirr.</p>

<p align="left">This is the last step in the line of progression. This task involves the slaying of Vishimtar The Fallen. This task can be accepted by speaking with General Lereh Dirr.

At the time of writeing this guide there are only 3 guilds that I know of that have accomplished the defeat of this mighty foe. My Congratulations goes out to Darkwind of the Antonius Bayle server for being the first to complete him across all servers. My guild has yet to defeat him so I do not have the text from the next set of turn in's and the 5th aa yet, so this will be updated as soon as I have finished.
