        people that don't know what Global Combat is, its kind of like Risk
        except online and much faster paced. If you have access to &quot;a
        second computer&quot; then its a great thing to play during those long
        boring raids where you're sitting around waiting for stuff to happen
        (not that I'd ever be playing Mdar and Saedyan during a Seru raid) It's free to register, etc and
        play. Anyone on Fennin can play; There's gonna be a 500pp entrance fee, first place
        winner will receive 70% of the pot, 2nd place winner 20% of the pot, and
        3rd place winner will receive 10% of the pot. If you wanna sign up, zip
        me an email <a href="mailto:cjf233@nyu.edu"> here</a> or talk to me in game.
        We'll start games once we have a
        good amount of people. If it goes well there'll be more competitions and
        we might get some guild v. guild fun etc.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
