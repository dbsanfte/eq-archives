										that, if you meet the requirements, your 
										forum access will be updated to allow 
										you to post in the App forum. Then you 
										may start a new thread in this forum 
										enclosing your application. Write your 
										application in an organized and easy to 
										read format. Be absolutely sure that 
										your application contains all of the 
										required information!! You will also at

										times a week MINIMUM***(that means full 
										from the raid beginning to end) around 4 
										- 5 pm pst to around 10 - 11pm pst 
										(maybe more)... Then I don't think we

										TMO is a raiding guild. We need active 
										people like YOU out there, And I know 
										you want to be part of the best. This is 
										your chance. We are ACTIVELY recruiting 
										people who are....<br>
										<br>
										1. Skilled<br>
										2. Meet requirements<br>
										3. Active (as previously mentioned)<br>
										4. MUST HAVE ALL EXPANSIONS.<br>
										<br>
										Minimum equipment needs to be somewhat 
										standardized around full OOW Rares/DoN 
										Merchant gear. No Epic? No problem. We 
										might help you a bit, but don't expect 
										it.&nbsp; Epics come in time, and 
										patience is a virtue.&nbsp; If you're 
										joining TMO to be equipped, we don't 
										need you either. We're here to get 
										further in the game, and loot is only a 
										secondary. (It will come naturally of 
										course, if the guild performs well.)<br>
										<br>
										Applicants are to post on the message 
										board, and write an introduction to 
										yourself (level, AA, Flags, Previous 
										guild history), A small essay regarding 
										your class and it's role in a raid 
										situation, and the top 3 reasons a raid 
										fails. If you get no's on your apps, it 
										doesn't mean we hate (not yet anyways!) 
										it just means we have some concerns 
										about your apps. Whomever votes no on 
										you, you should talk and get stuff 
										straightened out.<br>
										<br>
										If you are thinking about joining TMO 
										and just happened to read this on a 
										pass-by but think you're not good enough 
										or TMO is too l337 for you? Well you are 
										wrong. As long as you have activity and 
										the will to learn, you will always 
										improve your game. Don't settle for 
										apping for other guilds just because 
										&quot;you don't think you have what it takes&quot; 
										Apply for yourself then figure out if 
										it's right for you or not! I know there 
										are many TMO who talk to me and tell me, 
										&quot;I didn't apply before because I thought 
										I wasn't good enough.&quot; Most of those 
										people fit right in and enjoy the 
										high-end raiding guild on Fennin Ro.<br>

										Here's a Summary of what we need AND 
										class specific requirements, take note 
										that we need people with good 
										connections. Other classes other than 
										clerics can get away with lagging a bit, 
										but clerics need to be of the best 
										connections possible. If you got a 
										computer that can't handle that 
										situation... wait for upgrades and get

										raid situation with your current 
										computer/internet connection, I'm sorry 
										but those people will just lag the guild 
										behind when we need to push forward to 
										be the best on the server.&nbsp; (Please 
										note that Priest classes are required to 
										have RGC/Pure Blood/Blood of Nadox 
										spells in addition to the requirements 
										listed below)</font></p>

										Non-level-based requisites: <br>
										<br>
										1. We're very foul mouthed, especially 
										me =p You cannot take offense to this. 
										Be prepared to be reemed for mistakes.
										<br>
										<br>
										2. We recruit you for what you apply 
										for, once you are in, I'm not going to 
										tolerate any switching of mains, unless 
										we are in dire need.<br>
										<br>
										3. Server transfers are welcome and 
										encouraged.&nbsp; We're eager to have a 
										great player from any server join us, 
										but don't expect a free ride.&nbsp; Once 
										here, you will need to show us what you 
										got.&nbsp; I promise it will be worth 
										it.<br>
										<br>
										4. Once again and I *stress* this... 
										Active and on average, able to raid 4 - 
										5 days a week (FULL raid days, not just 
										one here one there) <br>
										<br>
										5. Must know how to play your class. I 
										don't care if you're a cleric with 5 
										billion AA, and level 70 with FT500 or 
										whatever. If you can't follow CH orders, 
										or know how to heal in a raid situation, 
										we don't need you. <br>
										<br>
										6. Flag requisites: None at the moment, 
										however it would <b>STRONGLY </b>help if 
										you have completed the Signet Quest for 
										Citadel of Anguish access.&nbsp; This is 
										not required before you app, but once 
										you do app, this will be your number one 
										priority if you haven't done it.&nbsp; 
										We can piggy you in, but you need this 
										part done for us to do it.&nbsp; This is 
										all one groupable.<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										Depending on your situation, there are 
										exceptions to requirements, though they 
										may not be so negotiable. Classes that 
										are higher in demand may/may not get 
										this break. </font>

										<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#008000">
										Applicants are to post on the message 
										board, and write an introduction to 
										yourself (level, AA, Flags, Previous 
										guild history), A small essay regarding 
										your class and it's role in a raid 
										situation, and the top 3 reasons a raid 
										fails. <br>
										<br>
										Oh one more thing... If you get no's on 
										your apps, it doesn't mean we hate (not 
										yet anyways!) it just means we have some 
										concerns about your apps. Whomever votes 
										no on you, you should talk and get stuff 
										straightened out if possible.<br>
										<br>
										If you are thinking about joining TMO 
										and just happened to read this on a 
										pass-by but think you're not good enough 
										or TMO is too l337 for you? Well you are 
										wrong. As long as you have activity and 
										the will to learn, you will always 
										improve your game. Don't settle for 
										apping for other guilds just because 
										&quot;you don't think you have what it takes&quot; 
										Apply for yourself then figure out if 
										it's right for you or not! I know there 
										are many TMO who talk to me and tell me, 
										&quot;I didn't apply before because I thought 
										I wasn't good enough.&quot; Most of those 
										people fit right in and enjoy the 
										high-end raiding guild on Fennin Ro. <br>
										<br>
										Good luck to you guys on your 
										applications.</font></p>

										<p align="left">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#00FFFF">
										Assuming everything goes well and you 
										meet all the requirements, you should be 
										given access to post your application to 
										TMO.&nbsp; TMO members will be able to 
										vote and post on your app once it's 
										posted.&nbsp; <b>DO NOT RESPOND TO YOUR 
										OWN APP WITH A NEW POST.&nbsp; EDIT YOUR 
										ORIGINAL APP POST TO KEEP IT UP TO DATE 
										AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS PEOPLE MAY 
										HAVE.&nbsp; </b>Also at this time, you 
										will be extended an invitation into our 
										Applicant Guild, &lt;Afkite Masters&gt;.&nbsp; 
										We have found it easier to keeps our 
										applicants under a guild tag during the 
										app phase for better communication, head 
										counts, and a chance to get to know 
										fellow apps.&nbsp; When you log on, the 
										first thing you should do is ask for an 
										invite to TMO Channels (there are 2 of 
										them).&nbsp; Any officer will be able to 
										invite you, as can several veteran 
										members.&nbsp; If your confused, just 
										ask.</font></p>
										<p align="left">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#00FFFF">
										As an app, your entitled to pretty much 
										nothing.&nbsp; You can ask on loot, but 
										will only get it if no full member needs 
										(apps have got some very nice stuff 
										though, and when we do Plane of Time, 
										it's truly app heaven!).&nbsp; If we 
										have to many people on a raid, apps wil 
										be the first ones asked to sit out 
										(unless they are a cleric, or it's a 
										retro flag an app happens to need.&nbsp; 
										We do have a little bit of a heart).&nbsp; 
										The app period can last as little as 30 
										days or as many as 60.&nbsp; It depends 
										on your level of activity and the votes 
										you get, but in the end the final 
										decision lays in the hands of the 
										officers and guild leader.&nbsp; </font>
										</p>
										<p align="left">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#00FFFF">
										Also remember, when you are apping to 
										TMO you still represent TMO.&nbsp; This 
										means that you will maintain a high 
										standard of integrity and respect 
										towards your fellow players, and follow 
										the rules of the game as set out by SOE.&nbsp; 
										Use of third party programs to alter 
										gameplay can result in immediate closure 
										of your application, or a loss of your 
										tag should you have made it that far.</font></p>
										<p align="left">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#00FFFF">
										If you have a question feel free to ask, 
										but consider asking a veteran member of 
										your class before you go to an officer.&nbsp; 
										Chances are that if they are your class, 
										they know the role you should be 
										performing better than some stupid 
										lizard with a long tail anyways.&nbsp; 
										If there is still any confusion, don't 
										be afraid to ask an officer.&nbsp; We 
										don't bite.</font></p>
