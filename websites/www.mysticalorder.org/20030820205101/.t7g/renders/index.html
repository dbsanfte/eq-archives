<center><br>A little history...<br></center>
In the past I was quite into conventional art. When I was young I would draw and paint and all of that, sometime during highschool
I took art classes which were fun, but one of my later teachers was a really anal person and not having a decent amount of time to
finish assignments turned me off to conventional art for good. Creating things quickly for a grade without being able to exercise
creativity just wasn't fun. So I gave up conventional art completely. Sadly, no digital copies or even hardcopies of some of my old
works still exist.<br><br>
At some point, I picked up tinkering with Photoshop and made some decent artworks with filters, although I didn't feel it was real
art - Due to it being done with filters and not much creative talent. I later on picked up on 3d rendering using Bryce 5, and recently
started using Poser4 to add more realism to my art. When I can, I'll include a jpeg version and if I have the origional render still, 
I'll also have a high quality version available to download.<br><br>
In any case, here are some of the things I've done and put up on the internet for people to enjoy. I create these to exercise my creativity, 
and for my friends to enjoy. Feel free to use them as your desktop wallpaper or use them on your website, just 
remember where you found them and give credit where credit is due. Also, I do suggest you look at the entire page. I just wrote 
and put up a comment system so if you'd like to leave a message, you'll find the comment book links near the bottom of the page!<br><br>

<center><br>Icy Despair.<br></center>
It's been a while hasn't it? Yes, it has. I never really left, I've just been busy. Theres no reason to explain other 
than now I'm a normal person who despises thier job, makes too little and spends too much. In any case, I apologize for 
a few things first. At this time I only have a 1024x768 copy of this rendered, It's probably not done using superfine 
anti-ailiasing, and it's not really a picture I worked hard on. I just used it as an example to show Emma, who I'm 
teaching Bryce and Poser to. So, it's nothing special, but it's here for those that want it. It is a product of both Emma 
and I messing around, her trying to make new images and me trying to teach her the tricks I use. I admired the fog effect 
so I figured I'd post it up here. I have two other images but it will take forever for me to render them at 1600x1200. 
I'll put them up when I can, and a new version of Icy Despair when I can finally render it full size. You see, I no longer 
use my old computer to make these, and, well. My laptop died an early death, "Those who live on luck die young" ?

Another serene tropical ocean scene. One of the first renders I've done in a while without a figure in it. I hope you're happy! There isn't really too much to 
say about this image. I suppose it just speaks for itself. "Cherish this moment, for happiness is elusive" - very wise words indeed. There are quite a few 
recent moments I wish I would've cherished more, and now they're gone forever and it will never be the same.. In any case, I'm off to

Far off in the twilight. My first indoor render in Bryce that actually turned out very good. I wanted to do something with
reflections before making this and accidently made the reflections in this do just that. Well, you'll find quite a few neat
details if you look closely. I'm actually quite happy with this image, which means noone else will be, but meah. Whatever ;P

Some people have recently complained about me not having enough dark and forboding images. So here it is, Dead days refuse to 
dream. Not really one of my best Bryce renders, but it should appease the evil crowd and I learned an important lesson in Bryce
to make this. I've kinda been out of inspiration lately but this turned out okay, I'm not really all that happy with it though.

Off the edge of despair... My ninth Bryce render. The origional unfinished picture didn't convey the meaning of the scene too well
and I had so many problems with the water not looking right due to the top down perspective. Yes, this is staged on the top of a cliff 
looking down. I can't help that Bryce is not good with looking down :E Or maybe I just can't do the depth right. I would give a better 
explaination of this work, but I just got off work and I am so very tired and I need sleep for work tomorrow so. I'll leave it up to you to 
discern the meaning of this image, and by the way. All of my images have hidden meanings and messages, you just need to think about them.
Even I'm amazed periodically by the things I come up with. Well then.. Off the edge of despair?

<center><br>Breezy...<br></center>
Well I know some of you are wondering why I keep using this character over and over again in many different renders. The only real answer
I can think of is that I'm quite proud of the character I've created. So I've done a few images with her in it. Those of you who would
rather just see scenes by me need not worry as I won't always use this character in my scenes, but she fits quite well :D So, in any case. 
Breezy is my eighth Bryce render. I've lately been inspired to add human figures to my scenes, and she quite well fits the surreal profile 
of my images by looking human and anime-ish at the same time. I do realize there is quite a bit of open space, but I really didn't know what 
to put there, and the focus of the image is obviously her. So I rendered it straight up and left that space open. Hopefully noone is 
terribly disappointed in me for it. Anyways, on to the image. I hope you're not too disappointed!

And if I look up in your eyes.. Will you notice me? Or notice it? Or fade into this accident?<br><br>
This image takes the place of my seventh render, using a figure I modeled in Poser 4, and rendered in Bryce 5.1. I really don't know what 
inspired me to create this, but I am extremely happy with the result. I may be doing a few more renders of it to different skies. It started out with a 
single blue tree. The one you'll see on the left, and eventually came to have all that it has now. I wanted to do another image that was forest-ish, but 
I just couldn't get a really good idea for one, until this morning when I had the idea to create this. Did I mention I really like how it came 
out?<br><br>
In any case, here it is. My seventh render - dedicated to Asher. One of the most simple yet detailed images I've ever done, which I am more than 
proud of :D<br><br>

Cheshire Forest is my fifth rendering in Bryce 5 and the first render I've done using a character I've modeled in Poser 4 and imported into

Cheshire cat. I intended to create a surreal setting out of Alice in Wonderland. This is why some of the mushrooms have a glassy texture. It

<center><br>Dream of the Shore<br></center>
Dream of the Shore was my fourth Bryce render. It was the product of me tinkering with layering water to achieve a tropical look. For
a long time, Dream of the Shore remained on my harddrive collecting dust - unfinished. I eventually picked it up again and started 
playing with it. When I finished and did my first render of it I was extremely surprised to see the result. It was probably the start 
of my more complex renders and remains one of my best works. The idea for it is based off a scene from Chrono Cross on Opassa beach - 
Looking out into the ocean. It was a really beautiful scene and I did my best to recreate something like it. After the initial final 
render. I noted that the beach looked very unrealistic due to the water just ending on the sand, so I made a fixed version which I 
dubbed the final version. The surf didn't come out as good as I would've hoped, but all in all I think the image turned out very good 
in the end. I've uploaded the three images from the three stages of it's creation.<br><br>

The Blue Glass Terrace is my third render in Bryce and probably my least favorite. The idea came from something I thought of one day in 
one of my English classes many years ago. The premise is that it's a terrace made of blue glass overlooking the ocean. It never 
turned out how I wanted it to. I couldn't get the glass to be transparent the way I wanted it to be and reflective. In the end I 
think it looks washed out and isn't the way I would've liked it to be. I include it since some people liked it and it is in my

waterfalls and other such things. You see, my seventh render may take a while to complete because I demand perfection in it. I'm
