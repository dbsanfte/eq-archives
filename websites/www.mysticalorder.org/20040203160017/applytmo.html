<p><b><u><font color="#800000" face="Verdana"><a name="Top"></a>A forward from 
Edarion:</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For those of you applying. The most important 
thing YOU yourself as an app can show is that you level to the approximation of 
the requirements first. NOT only that... but if you cannot dedicate yourself to 
raiding ***4 - 5 times a week MINIMUM ***(that means full from the raid 
beginning to end) around 4 - 5 pm pst to around 10 - 11pm pst (maybe more)... 
Then I don't think we need you. (maybe if you were a certain class, yes, but I 
still need ACTIVE members... *NOT* casual players)<br>
<br>
TMO is a raiding guild. We need active people like YOU out there, And I know you 
wanna be part of the best. This is your chance. We are ACTIVELY recruiting 
people who are....<br>
<br>
1. Skilled<br>
2. <a href="http://www.mysticalorder.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=1693">
Meet requirements</a><br>
3. Of key classes<br>
4. Active (as previously mentioned)<br>
5. Meet flag requirements AND MUST HAVE ALL EXPANSIONS.<br>
<br>
Equipment needs to be somewhat standardized into equivalent of around full POG 
and 36 - 41% haste for melee and around that equivalent for Priest/caster 
classes. No Epic? No problem. We might help you a bit, but don't expect it. 
There are VERY successful people in TMO without epics, but that doesn't hinder 
how they can play their character to their full potential. Nor is it guild 
obligation to get ppl their epics. The only exception to this is Bards, they 
absolutely positively need their epic. If you're joining TMO to be equipped, I 
don't need you either. We're here to get further in the game, and loot is only a 
secondary. (It will come naturally of course, if the guild performs well.)<br>
<br>
Applicants are to post on the message board, and write an introduction to 
yourself (level, AA, Flags, Previous guild history), A small essay regarding 
your class and it's role in a raid situation, and the top 3 reasons a raid 
fails. If you get no's on your apps, it doesn't mean we hate (not yet anyways!) 
it just means we have some concerns about your apps. Whomever votes no on you, 
you should talk and get stuff straightened out.<br>
<br>
If you are thinking about joining TMO and just happened to read this on a 
pass-by but think you're not good enough or TMO is too l337 for you? Well you 
are wrong. As long as you have activity and the will to learn, you will always 
improve your game. Don't settle for apping for other guilds just because &quot;you 
don't think you have what it takes&quot; Apply for yourself then figure out if it's 
right for you or not! I know there are many TMO who talk to me and tell me, &quot;I 
didn't apply before because I thought I wasn't good enough.&quot; Most of those 
people fit right in and enjoy the high-end raiding guild on Fennin Ro.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you guys on your applications.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF0000">*NOTE: Please do not harass 
Edarion with questions about the application process. You have many resources 
you can go to for questions, this website, Exotika and myself, other veterans in 
the guild - there is no reason to ask Edarion and if you bother him with a 
question at the wrong time it could have dire consequences. PLEASE direct 
questions regarding TMO and applications to other sources.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Think you've got what it takes? In that case 
the next thing you need to do is read and follow the steps by Exotika listed 
below. Exotika will be your go-to person for any questions you may have about 
the application process. I personally would also recommend you find one close 
friend in TMO who you can ask other questions to and to guide you through the 
process. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such a 'mentor' is invaluable for all those 
questions like 'how does dkp work?'. Also try to find a veteran in your class.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">TMO has the most skilled players on the server 
and its a good idea to find out exactly what is expected from you in a raid. And 
now on to Exotika (Goddess of Afkite) and her steps. Good luck with your 
application process and you're more than welcome to speak to me about any 
questions you might have as well.</font></p>

planning to apply to TMO, please follow these steps:</b></font><br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="#CC00CC">[1] </font>Start by reading Edarion's Recruiting Post 
which is stickied at the top of this forum or at the top of this page. Read it 
thoroughly!<br>
<br>
<font color="#CC00CC">[2] </font>In Edarion's post, read the <b>requirements</b> 
(see definition below) for your class (specific AA skills and flag 
requirements). Be sure to check whether or not your class is currently being 
recruited! Recruiting changes frequently so
<a href="http://www.mysticalorder.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=1693" target="_blank">
GO CHECK</a>!!<br>
<br>
<font color="#CC00CC">[3]</font> If you meet the minimum requirements for 
applicants of your class, send me a private message on these forums stating your 
wish to apply and include a brief summary of your AAs and flags. After that, if 
you meet the requirements, I will update your forum access to allow you to post 
in this forum. Then you may start a new thread in this forum enclosing your 
application. Write your application in an organized and easy to read format. Be 
absolutely sure that your application contains all of the required information!! 
You will also at that time receive access to our private applicant forum where 
you will find important information for applicants.<br>
<br>
<font color="#3333FF"><b>Please Note: </b></font>If recruiting for your class is 
currently closed, but you feel TMO should consider you anyway, you are required 
to include the names of 10 TMO recommendations (2 from your class) in your 
private message to me. You will be able to post your application once all 10 
sponsors have verified their sponsorship of your application with me. <b>
Applications from closed classes will not be considered or be allowed to be 
posted until the recommendations are included and verified.</b><br>
<br>
<font color="#3333FF"><b>Cross Server apps: </b></font>We're sorry but at this 
time, we are not accepting applications from other servers if your class is 
currently &quot;closed&quot; (check Edarion's recruiting post to see what classes are 
open/closed).<br>
<br>
<font color="#800000">***If you do <b>not</b> meet the minimum requirements to 
apply, you will <b>not</b> be given forum access to post an application until 
you meet them. There are no exceptions.***</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#CC00CC">[Note:]</font>&quot;Requirement&quot;:<br>
\Re*quire&quot;ment\ (-ment), n. <br>
1. The act of requiring; demand; requisition.<br>
2. That which is required; an imperative or authoritative command; an essential 
condition; something needed or necessary; a need.<br>

<br>
<b><font color="#800000">Incomplete applications will not be considered.</font></b><br>
<br>
<font color="#CC00CC">[4]</font>After you have posted your complete application, 
you will then be contacted in game to discuss your application, to answer any 
questions you may have about the application process, and to invite you into our 
applicant guild. <br>
<br>
<font color="#3333FF">TMO members may <b>begin voting</b> on your application 
from this point forward.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#CC00CC">[5]</font>During your application period, please keep your 
application up to date by using the &quot;Edit&quot; function on your original post. 
Keeping a log at the bottom of your application of new AAs and Flags attained is 
highly recommended. <b>EDIT your post! Do not reply to your own thread.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Note</b>: If you receive a lot of &quot;No&quot; votes, it will appear that your 
application is not being supported. In this situation, you will be contacted and 
your application may be closed. <br>
<br>
<b><font color="#800000">Disclaimer: Edarion has the final say regarding 
invitations to our applicant guild.</font></b><br>
<br>
<font color="#3333FF"><i>Keep in mind that once invited into our applicant 
guild, you will be expected to uphold the standards of a TMO member.</i> </font>
<br>
You will be expected to attend every raid that you are online for, and you will 
be expected to be online and contributing to the guild when you are not at work, 
at school, or otherwise committed. This being said, do not apply to TMO if you 
are not an active player. Remember that the manner in which you carry yourself 
in game, and any actions that you choose to do, will reflect upon TMO, good and 
bad alike.<br>
<br>
<font color="#3333FF"><i>The most frequently asked question is, &quot;How long will I 
be an app?&quot;</i></font><br>
The keys to earning a TMO tag are high raid attendance and exellent raid 
performance. Expect a minimum of 1 month of meeting expectations before being 
considered for a TMO tag, but your app time can range anywhere from a few weeks 
to a few months depending on the individual and is at the sole discretion of 
Edarion.<br>
