<hr>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">A few points on AOL:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="3">The AOL software controls the modem, protocols
    and flow control.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>AOL bypasses any Windows settings
    concerning the modem including initialization strings.</b></font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="3">AOL servers have a limited number of
    first-come-first-served 56k modems.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Any late log-ins get 33.6k and 28.8k
    connections.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="3">AOL customers can be &quot;bumped&quot; from
    their server... first in means first out.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="3">AOL connections are timed.&nbsp; Every 45
    minutes online the customer will get a pop-up that they must click on in
    less than 15 minutes or be disconnected, even while downloading.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="3">AOL mailboxes are small and tightly
    controlled. An AOL customer cannot receive an email larger than 1.5MB, and
    may not keep more than 10MB in their box. If larger mails come in they may
    never get to the customer or may not be intact if they do make it through.
    Also, AOL uses dumbed-out anti-spam software that will block many incoming
    greeting cards, etc.</font>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Some AOL technicians will insist that your
    modem has an incorrect <b>UART</b> (Universal Asynchronous
    Receiver/Transmitter) setting.&nbsp; Call your modem's manufacturer to
    determine if you have a hardware or software modem (Winmodem). In order to
    have a UART you must have a hardware modem.&nbsp; Hence any Winmodem CANNOT
    have an incorrect UART setting because there is no UART.</font></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Here is what you can do as an AOL customer:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">1. Contact your local phone company's repair
center and request a &quot;Point to Point Line Test&quot; (PTPLT) between the
phone number the modem uses and the phone number of the internet connection.&nbsp;
The phone company will pulse the lines to find flaws and perform necessary
repairs at their own expense.&nbsp; The average dial-up will go through up to 30
connections before reaching the server.&nbsp; All it takes is noise or
corruption on <b>one</b> of those 30 lines to hobble the connection.&nbsp; Most
phone companies guarantee a minimum connect speed and quality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">2. Contact local electronics shops to purchase a
&quot;Noise Reducing Phone Line&quot; (NRPL).&nbsp; This looks much like a
standard phone line (usually 6 feet in length) that has a rubber &quot;U&quot;
on the line near one end.&nbsp; This is a resistor about the size of a
thumbnail.&nbsp; Use of this device usually produces an extra 2000 - 6000bps and
may be placed in-line with longer phone lines.&nbsp; Average cost is $1.00.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">3. Contact AOL technical support at
1-800-827-6364 for assistance with uninstalling and reinstalling the AOL
software. Be sure to pressure them into a FULL uninstallation, including the AOL
Dial-Up Adapter and the file folders.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">If none of the above accomplish anything it is recommended
that you change your ISP.&nbsp; Not all ISP's are created equally, nor are their
equipment and interest in customer satisfaction.&nbsp; Some of the higher
quality mainstream ISP's are Mindspring, Flashnet, Earthlink, WT-Net, CyberRamp
and CoolLink.</font></p>
