<h3><font color="#CC9966">Website Update! - August 10, 2001:</font></h3>
<p>Website back up, my appologies for all the trouble.  I really need someone to host this site...
   It's dynamilly assigned, so if you have about 40mb of hard drive space (10 for website, 30 for 
   Apache serving software_, a DSL or Cable modem, and don't mind giving a little of your 
   bandwidth to Vita, please contact me for details.</p>
<h3><font color="#CC9966">Website Update! - June 17, 2001:</font></h3>
<p>Thanks to Vipar for the new look!! Pretty swank, eh?</p>
<h3><font color="#CC9966">Website Update! - June 2, 2001</font></h3>
<p>Website back up, thanks for your patience.</p>

<p>More screenshots have arrived and are posted in the Photos.&nbsp; I am also 
  beginning to receive screenshots for the soon-to-be &quot;Giblet's Death Page&quot;. 
  :)&nbsp; What I am missing are the stories, though.&nbsp; We all started gathering 
  screenshots just recently but the death string has been long-running.&nbsp; 
  Give me the scoop for the page! </p>
<h3><font color="#CC9966">News - April 4, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>I had mentioned the work of a man named Shadoe in our forum a while back and 
  I promised to try to make contact with him.&nbsp; Well, I have done so and he 
  is still the kind-natured and giving soul that he always has been.&nbsp; I was 
  simply elated to find him again.&nbsp; It turns out that EQX didn't really shut 
  down but rather morphed into Otherworld Express (OWX).&nbsp; The incredible 
  story that he is writing is called <a href="http://express.stratics.com/credits/shadoe.htm" target="_blank">&quot;The 
  Pact of Zeranon&quot;</a> and is currently in its 17th of 28 chapters.&nbsp; 
  If you are a fan of medieval fantasy literature you simply have to read this 
  story.&nbsp; The link above is to the archives where the first 12 chapters are 
  and you can find 13 - 17 in the current issues of <a href="http://express.stratics.com" target="_blank">OWX</a>.&nbsp; 
  Once all the chapters have been written and published Shadoe may allow me to 
  host the complete e-book on our site.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be wonderful?&nbsp; 
  /cheer Shadoe </p>
<h3><font color="#CC9966">News - March 30, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>Many people (including myself) have been experiencing video issues in EQ since 
  the last patch.&nbsp; While Verant says they're working on it they have not 
  released any information about the actual problem.&nbsp; I've done some homework 
  and it appears that these issues only exist for people that use a video card 
  that has 2 video chips that run in tandem.&nbsp; Some of the cards known to 
  be affected are all SIS, the GeForce Ultra (but not the Ultra 2 because the 
  chips are not tandem), the TNT Explode series and the Voodoo 5.&nbsp; I think 
  I have found the root of the issue and it deals with how the new version of 
  eqgame.exe is attempting to access your system to work with the tandem chips.&nbsp;

<h3><font color="#CC9966">News - March 25, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>The website, email, FTP and personal websites will be unreachable for an estimated 
  4 hours beginning at approximately 10:00am PST tomorrow (Monday).&nbsp; This 
  is due to a full server upgrade.&nbsp; I apologize for any inconvenience this 
  may cause you. </p>
