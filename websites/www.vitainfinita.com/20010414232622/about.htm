<h1 align="center">About Us</h1>

<p> Vita Infinita is a newly formed Lanys T'Vyl guild that was forged when the fine members of several guilds came together to form a union of friendship and power. These guilds were Power Elite, Cladagh, Lore
Keepers and Steel Alliance. The involved guilds were not one of haphazard selection for the sake of
sheer size but rather a union of friends that all share the same desire to group together and accomplish what the few cannot. Honor,
integrity and friendship will be the mainstay for us all to live by.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vita Infinta is a guild that puts its Members first.  Our goal is to be a group of friends that is always willing to aide
one&nbsp; another.  Most of all, we work to keep the game exciting and fun for everyone involved.</p>
