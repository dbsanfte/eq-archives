Vita Infinita members will not use /anonymous and will fly their Vita Infinita banners <b><i>AT ALL TIMES</i></b>. If you need privacy you may use /roleplay.<BR>
<BR><u><b>Twinking</b></u><BR>
VI has nothing specific to say regarding the act of twinking. However, asking VI members to twink your characters (mains or alts) will not to be 
tolerated especially over guild chat. If you expect people to give you things than you’re in the wrong guild. Asking to buy something is fine and if a 
member offers to give you an item then so be it. Member’s generosity should never be put on the spot by being “asked” to give anyone anything.<BR>
<BR><u><b>Powerleveling</b></u><BR>
Powerleveling is a tough topic. It is hard to say what is powerleveling and what is merely a little help. Asking a higher level friend in the guild for help 
through a hell level or to help you ding or anything of that nature will be fine as long as it’s kept out of guild chat. Hardcore powerleveling of characters 
is not going to be sanctioned by VI in any way. It creates poor players with low skills and poor players don’t benefit VI or themselves.<BR>
<BR><U><B>Guild requests for ports</b></u><BR>
If you are in need of a teleport you should try to find a ride by using the following process of elimination. First, is there someone in your group or very 
close-by that can port you? Second, is there someone in the zone or one zone over that can port you? If you still haven’t found a ride then do a /who all 
Vita to see what porting capable guildmates might be on. Use your common sense to find members that may not be busy (for instance, someone in WC, 
EC, DL etc…) and send them a <b>TELL</b> to ask for assistance. Move down the list and ask members by using <b>TELLS</b>. Sending out random requests for 
help over guild chat should be at a MINIMUM. You should also do your best to be at or near a druid ring or wizzy spire to be picked up. Please do not 
expect porters to port to your nearest zone and run through 3 zones to give you a ride.<BR>
<BR><u><b>Guild requests for rezzes</b></u><BR>
If you are in need of a rez you should try to find a ride by using the following process of elimination. First, is there someone in your group or very 
close-by that can rez you? Second, is there someone in the zone or one zone over that can rez you? If you still haven’t found a rez then do a /who all 
Vita to see what cleric guildmates might be on. Use your common sense to find members that may not be busy (for instance, someone in WC, EC, DL 
etc…) and send them a <b>TELL</b> to ask for assistance. Move down the list and ask members by using <b>TELLS</b>. Sending out random requests for help 
over guild chat should be at a MINIMUM. Please try to procure transportation for the cleric ahead of time if needed (see “Guild requests for ports” 
above).<BR>
<BR><u><b>Message Board</b></u><BR>
The message board is for positive communication between guildmates outside of the game. It helps us to organize raids and exchange game 
information or just to chat about things with our friends. Please use the message board in a respectful, positive manner. Posting messages that are 
hateful, incite or instigate other members, or are found to be otherwise hurtful to the guild or members MAY be removed by council. Even the 
touchiest of subjects can be posted in a postive, respectful way. Please use tact and common sense to avoid the ridiculous scenario of council having 
to censor posts...<BR>
<BR><u><b>Guild Chat</b></u><BR>
Guild chat is where we all as a family can communicate and have fun regardless of what we may be doing or how far away we are from each other. 
Guild chat is NOT the place to iron out differences, be overly vulgar or rude, argue, use inflammatory language, or instigate your guildmates. 
This behavior is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. <b><i>USING THE /GUILD CHANNEL IN THIS MANNER CAN RESULT IN DE-GUILDING!</i></b><BR>
<BR>Even if you have something personal to discuss with someone that is not negative, please do this in tells to cut down on the enormous amount of 
green spam that goes by. Ask yourself, does anyone other than who I am directing this to care about what I am saying? If the answer is no, take it 
to tells, please.<BR>
<BR><u><b>Inner-guild Disputes</b></u><BR>
Disputes between guildmates should at least be attempted to be resolved between the parties involved. This is a game so hopefully people can 
resolve their differences in this manner. If after attempting to resolve the conflict you are still at an impasse, the matter needs to be brought to the 
council for our intervention. All interested parties should send their “version” of the conflict to <A HREF="mailto:eqballzz@yahoo.com">eqballzz@yahoo.com</a> for our review. If you choose 
this option be warned that whatever is resolved by council may not be agreeable to either party but the council ruling on the matter will be final. 
<b>AT NO TIME WILL INNER-GUILD DISPUTES BE HASHED OUT OVER GUILD CHAT. DOING THIS CAN RESULT IN DE-GUILDING.</b> 
Please note that putting a guildmate on the /ignore list is not acceptable in Vita Infinita. If you are at that point you must follow the steps above to 
reach some sort of resolution. Please do not <b>IGNORE</b> your guildmates!<BR>
<BR><u><b>Disputes that involve non-guildmates</b></u><BR>
Disputes between guildmates and non-guildmates should at least be attempted to be resolved between the parties involved. This is a game so hopefully
 people can resolve their differences in this manner. If after attempting to resolve the conflict you are still at an impasse, the matter needs to be 
brought to the council for our intervention. All interested parties should send their “version” of the conflict to <A href="mailto:eqballzz@yahoo.com">eqballzz@yahoo.com</a> for our review. 
If the non-guildmate is part of a guild then contact information for their guild should be provided such as council members or guildleader name. 
The council will discuss the matter and look to either the non-guildmate or the non-guildmates guild contact or both to resolve the matter.<BR>
<BR><u><b>Complaints about guild members(from non-guildmates)</b></u><BR>
Anyone with a complaint about one of our members should speak with a council member or send a detailed account of the problem to 
<a href="mailto:eqballzz@yahoo.com">eqballzz@yahoo.com</a> for us to review. If you are truly looking for a resolution to a conflict please do not post on the general message boards as this 
will only result in flames.<BR>
<BR><u><b>Vita Raids</b></u><BR>
Vita raids should be advertised to the guild (and possibly elsewhere if required, such as Lanys.com or our allies message boards) on our message 
board in the Raids and Discussions thread with all pertinent raid information including but not limited to: day, time, level minimum, class requirements, 
resist requirements, loot rules (see below) and raid goals (i.e. This raid is to get Joe Bananas his epic ball of twine, which will default to him).<BR>
<BR>If you're signed up for a raid you are expected to show up on time or early or at least give notice to the raid leader prior to the raid if you can’t 
make it or will be late. You are expected to do all in your power to be at the raid location <b>PRIOR</b> to raid even if it means you have to do it the night 
before. This also means do your banking for resist gear, weapons, armor, food etc… beforehand as well. Asking porters in South Ro for a ride to pick 
up gear right before port up to Hate is <b>LAME</b>.<BR>
<BR><u><b>Loot rules on VI raids</b></u><BR>
At this time Vita has no guild-wide loot rules on VI raids. Loot rules will be determined on a raid by raid basis and are left up to the raid leader. All VI 
raids should have some form of loot rules posted on a raid thread prior to the raid date and/or gone over prior to the raid beginning.<BR>
<BR><b>ATTENTION VI RAID LEADERS</b>: to avoid conflicts, making clear loot rules prior to the raid should <b>NOT</b> be overlooked! Even if it the rules 
are very basic, this can't be stressed enough.
<BR>
<BR>
<b>NOTE:</b> Council <b><i>MAY</i></b> alter these policies or include additional policies as it sees fit, so remember...ignorance of guild policies is <b>NOT</b> an excuse to 
not follow them! </FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></center>
