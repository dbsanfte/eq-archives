<h3><font color="#FF0000">News - April 4, 2001:</font> </h3>


<p>I had mentioned the work of a man named Shadoe in our forum a while back and
I promised to try to make contact with him.&nbsp; Well, I have done so and he is
still the kind-natured and giving soul that he always has been.&nbsp; I was
simply elated to find him again.&nbsp; It turns out that EQX didn't really shut down
but rather morphed into Otherworld Express (OWX).&nbsp; The incredible story
that he is writing is called <a href="http://express.stratics.com/credits/shadoe.htm" target="_blank">&quot;The
Pact of Zeranon&quot;</a> and is currently in its 17th of 28 chapters.&nbsp; If
you are a fan of medieval fantasy literature you simply have to read this
story.&nbsp; The link above is to the archives where the first 12 chapters are
and you can find 13 - 17 in the current issues of <a href="http://express.stratics.com" target="_blank">OWX</a>.&nbsp;
Once all the chapters have been written and published Shadoe may allow me to
host the complete e-book on our site.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be wonderful?&nbsp;
/cheer Shadoe </p>


<h3><font color="#FF0000">News - March 30, 2001:</font> </h3>


<p>Many people (including myself) have been experiencing video issues in EQ
since the last patch.&nbsp; While Verant says they're working on it they have
not released any information about the actual problem.&nbsp; I've done some
homework and it appears that these issues only exist for people that use a video
card that has 2 video chips that run in tandem.&nbsp; Some of the cards known to
be affected are all SIS, the GeForce Ultra (but not the Ultra 2 because the
chips are not tandem), the TNT Explode series and the Voodoo 5.&nbsp; I think I
have found the root of the issue and it deals with how the new version of
eqgame.exe is attempting to access your system to work with the tandem
chips.&nbsp; I sent the information off to Verant (along with my DX and Event
logs) and you can view it <a href="video_errors.htm">here</a>. </p>


<h3><font color="#FF0000">News - March 25, 2001:</font> </h3>


<p>The website, email, FTP and personal websites will be unreachable for an
estimated 4 hours beginning at approximately 10:00am PST tomorrow
(Monday).&nbsp; This is due to a full server upgrade.&nbsp;
I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. </p>


<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Website Update! - March 22, 2001:</font> </h3>


<p>More people are sending in their screenshots and you can view them all in the
Photos section. :) </p>


<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Website Update! - March 19, 2001:</font> </h3>


<p>The results are in for the poll on whether or not to include a stock ticker
in the &quot;Real World&quot; area.&nbsp; They indicate a resounding
&quot;No&quot;.&nbsp; The majority shall rule in any poll held here and to that
end there will be no live stock ticker integrated to our site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>


<h3><font color="#FF0000">News - March 18, 2001:</font> </h3>


<p>There is now an FTP site established as part of our domain.&nbsp; It is
available for everyone to upload to and download from.&nbsp; The details of the
connection are in the &quot;Members Only&quot; section of the message
board.&nbsp; Enjoy! </p>


<p>***Note: Be sure to check your Vita mailbox for news of something new.&nbsp;
:) </p>


<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Website Update! - March 18, 2001:</font> </h3>


<p>If you look in your browser's status bar you'll see our new scrolling
messages feature there.&nbsp; :) </p>


<p>Not that most people care, but if you type in a bad link to anywhere on our
site or if I ever make a bad hyperlink in our pages you won't see that generic
&quot;404&quot; page that your browser generates anymore.&nbsp; hehe&nbsp; Now
you get a customized error page complete with hyperlinks to email me about the
error or to
return to the main page. </p>


<p>More screenshots have been added to the Photos section. </p>


<h3><font color="#FF0000">News - March 14, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>We have formed a Guild Alliance with the <a href="http://www.heraldsofdestiny.com/"> Heralds of
Destiny</a>.&nbsp; </p>


<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Website Update! - March 14, 2001:</font> </h3>


<p>A poll has been added to the &quot;Real World&quot; page linked above in
blue.&nbsp; Visit and cast your vote! </p>


<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Website Update! - March 11, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>More, more, more!&nbsp; Visit the link above for the &quot;real world&quot;
aspect of our website, complete with news and sports (which update every 10-15
minutes if updates are available) and a full blown search engine.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;
The time and date shown on the page are CST/U.S.&nbsp; The times shown in the
news and sports are EST/U.S. </p>
<p>Our first screenshots are up!&nbsp; Visit the Photos section to peruse them. </p>


<p>The site is getting large and detailed so I have established a copyright for the domain (at the bottom of this page) to help protect us from leeches. </p>


<h3><font color="#FF0000">News - March 11, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>It's quite apparent that many of our members do not read our message board
frequently.&nbsp; It is best to read it often as new posts are made every
day.&nbsp; There is valuable and current information there.&nbsp; Please do read
the board to keep current on guild happenings and activity and keep yourself in
the loop.&nbsp; :) </p>
<p>I know many of you are frustrated with the tool up top that shows how many
people are on Lanys, in Chat, etc, due to it not updating frequently
enough.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have no control over it.&nbsp; It's only&nbsp; a
script to pull the data from a service provider and we are at the mercy of their
own updating.&nbsp; It seems that they do not update on the weekends at
all.&nbsp; I have sent a message to inquire as to whether or not this is normal
behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Obvious even at a glance, I have made many changes to this
website/domain.&nbsp; I think it is now full-blown.&nbsp; hehe&nbsp; We have a
great guild roster, a Lanys-monitoring view, calendar, screenshot archive, tons
of links and troubleshooting help, a chat room, the message board, email and a
real-life portal.&nbsp; If anyone has more ideas of things to include please <a href="mailto:glasse@vitainfinita.com">email
me</a> and I'll see what I can do.&nbsp; :) </p>


<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Website Update! - March 10, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>Chat page added&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Just click on &quot;Chat&quot; in the bar
above and follow the directions on the page.&nbsp; You will see me logged in the
room at all times even though I'm not using it (necessary for proper function of
the program) </p>
<p>Added some information specific to DSL issues to the troubleshooting section. </p>
<p>Also, I have started putting all &quot;Website Updates&quot; in yellow and
all &quot;News&quot; entries in red to make site negotiation easier. </p>


<h3><font color="#FF0000">News - March 09, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>We now have an email server.&nbsp; Any member of the guild may have an email
box as charactername@vitainfinita.com!&nbsp;
See the message board for details in &quot;General Messages&quot;. </p>


<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Website Update! - March 09, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>Added a link to some awesome patches for broadband, dialup and web
surfing.&nbsp; See the Troubleshooting section (from the <a href="links.htm">Links</a>
section).&nbsp; </p>


<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Website Update! - March 08, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>Added several dialup and other troubleshooting tools.&nbsp; You can link to
them <a href="ts/troubleshooting.htm"> here</a> or from the Links page. </p>


<h3><font color="#FFFF00">Website Update! - March 07, 2001:</font> </h3>
<p>The website has temporarily moved to a new host.&nbsp; Please email <a href="mailto:glasse@vitainfinita.com">Glasse</a>
with any problems you encounter.&nbsp; Also, feel free to send him any content
you would like to see on the site.&nbsp; :) </p>
<p>The Member's page has shifted to <a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/index.cfm" target="_blank"> Guild
Magic</a>.&nbsp; If you have not registered your character there please do
so.&nbsp; Thank you. </p>
<p>The &quot;Links&quot; page is now active. </p>
