    The Terrifying Experience is rather the opposite of their name, providing a varied view of
    straight up rock music. Fronted by former Guided by Voices guitarist, Mitch Mitchell, you
    can pretty much guess the direction this is heading. And while it does skirt the edges of
    the former frontman's outfit, it's brief, yet enjoyable when it does happen
    (&quot;Universal Sheep Coma&quot;, &quot;Elizabeth and Mercury&quot;). Primarily, the
    Terrifying Experience is a rock outfit that houses punk energies that almost seems to
    careen at breakneck speeds from time to time (&quot;Woodshed Fist Fight&quot;, &quot;The
    Road to Hell&quot;). I guess to sum up the sound of the Terrifying Experience, try and
    imagine what would happen if Guided By Voices got rough, dirty and edgy. Personally, as a
    nominal Guided By Voices fan, the nods to the former outfit made this album pretty cool in
    my book. The times when The Terrifying Experience picked up the pace and started to rock
    at mach speeds were also rad and got my foot tapping, but sometimes bordered on silly (the
    lyrics to &quot;The Road to Hell&quot; are rather childish). Overall, however, this is a
    quality rock album.<br>

    <p><font face="Verdana"><small><small>This double dose of The Terrifying Experience
    catches the band's dirty guitar-led pop melodies in fine form. Less abrasive then previous
    releases, the two songs on this 7&quot; put a classic 70s rock feel into the year 2000,
    producing an up-to-date combination of rockin' riffage and familiar pop melodies that can
    attract a diverse crowd. The vocals are turned up on both songs, placing the chorus-heavy
    melodies at the forefront as the band drives home the message that loud rock can indeed be
    cool in the indie arenas of the world. Supposedly from the band's upcoming CD, these two
    songs are a good indication that another daunting Terrifying Experience will be well
    received. -- <a href="mailto:amagilow@splendidezine.com"><i>am</i></a></small></small></font><br>

    By Sara Farr</span>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>Few people embody rock &#145;n&#146;
    roll like Mitch Mitchell does. Currently the vocalist/guitarist for Terrifying Experience,
    Mitchell has had a long and fruitful career in several of Dayton&#146;s highest-arcing
    rock bands, including Guided by Voices (and Workhorse)&#133;.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>Now that Mitchell is doing his own
    thing&#133;his voice and his uncomplicated, clear songwriting have developed into a
    veritable powerhouse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Terrifying Experience
    is the sort of band that picks you up by the scruff of your neck and makes you rock &#150;
    no excuses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mitchell&#146;s songwriting cuts
    to the chase&#133;.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>&#147;Mitch has an ability to write very
    straightforward, easy songs,&#148; Workhorse guitarist Todd Sonnanstine said.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&#147;His songs really grab you &#150; he knows
    how to cut away through the flash and the icing and get to the meat and potatoes.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It&#146;s just a gift he has&#133;Mitch&#146;s
    minimalistic approach created great songs.&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>Nowhere is that more true than on
    Terrifying Experience&#146;s latest release, <i>Magnetic Breakthrough</i>, on which
    Mitchell uses a go-to-hell crunch of guitar, drum and bass to create a fusion of the best
    elements of rock experimentation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The rock
    anthems are there, but what makes <i>Magnetic Breakthrough</i> so interesting is its
    diversity and Mitchell&#146;s evolution as the lead songwriter of a band.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>The CD took a full year to record,
    according to Mitchell, mainly because of the distance between band members (guitarist
    Duane Hart, bassist Geoff Ortlip and drummer Mark Deane all live in Columbus), but also
    because he wanted the album to sound as though it captured different feelings and time
    frames.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#147;When you break it down, you can
    get different sounds and tones,&#148; Mitchell explained&#133;.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>The attention to detail shows.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Songs such as &#147;Tearful Champion&#148; and
    &#147;Anvil Jumper,&#148; originally released as a single, have been reworked and sound
    incredible; what makes &#147;Tearful Champion&#148; work so well are the intertwined
    guitar and bass lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The guitar work is
    polished, yet still raw, and Mitchell&#146;s cigarette-stained vocals are clear and
    confident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It&#146;s also a fairly
    experimental album.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once again, Mitchell has
    structured the sequence of the album as though it were a vinyl recording, complete with a
    Side A and Side B, split by&#133;(an 80-second) electronic interlude titled
    &#147;Underground Pressure,&#148; concocted by Mitchell&#146;s friend DJ Ali Obvious.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It&#146;s a wild, totally unexpected addition to a
    TE album, a cut that shows Mitchell&#146;s penchant for experimentation.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>&#147;I like to use weird things to show
    the separation between the two sides,&#148; Mitchell said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&#147;I like to work with different people and see if it will work.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I&#146;ll try anything.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If it doesn&#146;t work, who cares? And if it
    does, it&#146;s captured.&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>Perhaps the best song on the album,
    &#147;Universal Sheep Coma,&#148; reveals Mitchell&#146;s evolution as a player most
    clearly &#150; effects-laden guitar lines snake through the song, creating an earthy,
    instinctual groove.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#147;That&#146;s a real
    dynamic song,&#148; Mitchell said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#147;The
    way it&#146;s set up is that it&#146;s quiet, then just bursts into this full rock thing,
    then it&#146;s quiet again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just like that
    song because of the guitar work.&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>That Mitchell still evaluates his guitar
    ability, or songwriting ability, is one of the things that have helped make him the
    godfather of punk to many in Dayton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His DIY
    ethic and devotion to the craft have been with him since he first picked up the bass when
    he was 9 years old.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>&#147;I feel I still have to prove
    myself,&#148; he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#147;If I&#146;m
    worthy of praise then great, and if the (songs) are bad, then I&#146;m worthy of that,
    too.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess I&#146;m an eternal optimist.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I want to earn what I get because that&#146;s the
    only way it&#146;ll mean anything.&#148;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><small>&#133;&#147;I like this album a
    lot,&#148; he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&#147;I&#146;m really
    proud of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We&#146;re able to do what we
    want, since we&#146;re on an independent label, and I&#146;m thankful for that.<span
