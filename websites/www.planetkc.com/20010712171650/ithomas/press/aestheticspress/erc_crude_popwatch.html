    New Zealand Vanguard: <em>The Island Nation's Latest School of Individual Innovation</em><br>
    <small><font color="#C0C0C0">By Dan Vallor</font></small><strong><br>
    <br>
    CRUDE </strong>is <strong>Matt Middleton<br>
    </strong><small>Likely the most musicianly of New Zealand's crafty troubadours...Matt
    Middleton is on of the more established of New Zealand's cult figures, with an enormous
    portfolio of cassette releases and a few rather high-profile album releases.&nbsp; Having
    done time in Shayne Carter's revolving lineup of Dimmer and the obscure but semi-legendary
    Space Dust, as well as his own combos The All Electric and The Aesthetics, Middleton has
    developed a solid reputation in New Zealand's musical community.&nbsp; Exploring a
    seemingly unending series of musical non-sequiturs, Crude comes off as something of a
    post-Henry Cow snake charmer, a maven of electronic violence and a master of reeds (his
    signature instruments being saxophone and clarinet).&nbsp; Creating vaguely
    Chrome-inspired splatter with a sort of bizarrely robotic Beefheartian blues-rock,
    Middleton is one of the most colorful eccentrics working today.&nbsp; The influences are
    expansive (Sun Ra, glam rock, euro-ethnic folk jazz, early electronic saboteurs such as
    The Normal, krautrock, No Wave...the list goes on), but these inspirations serve only as a
    jumping off point.&nbsp; What appears within is an audio time warp, simultaneously
    retrogressive and indescribably futuristic.&nbsp; Some of his releases are lengthy
    expulsions of harsh noise while others are inspired rock and jazz inventions.&nbsp; At
    times, Crude sounds like the missing link to the early-80s Manhattan scene, other times he
    sounds like the death of Marc Bolan.&nbsp; And then there's his corporate culture and
    Silicon Valley fixations; he's either creating &quot;New Soundtracks for Sony
    Playstations&quot; or he's turning computers and analog synthesizers into a demolition of
    electronica, Space Invaders style.&nbsp; Whatever Middleton is up to, it's always from a
    new angle and always pretty inspiring.&nbsp; He's prolific (more material is coming out
    monthly, it seems), and also remarkably artful.&nbsp; I have a hard time keeping up but
    I'm going to keep trying.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><em>SOUNDS</em><br>
    <small>Crude</strong>: The sound initially was a product of the technology and
    instrumentation on hand.&nbsp; Cheap guitars, the clarinet, the 4-track, the financial
    bandwidth of New Zealand's unemployment benefit, the barter system, a vague interest in
    musical advancement, an even vaguer interest in New Zealand's &quot;alternative music
    scene&quot;, the quest for that &quot;thing&quot; that you can't describe in words with
    music and, of course, soft drugs.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><em>NEW ZEALAND<br>
    </em><small>Crude</strong>: My interests are separatist and pseudo-capitalist at present,
    a paradoxical slant owing to my complete dependence on NZ's welfare system plus the fact
    that in essence I am and will always be regarded as part of the New Zealand music
    underground.&nbsp; Having said this I must confess that from time to time there is
    support.&nbsp; Flying Nun released a CD and failed to promote it properly, Crawlspace and
    Trinder Records have released singles, Juggernaut Records are releasing a new CD and lots
    of punks with no money are interested.&nbsp; There's also the slowly germinating entity
    that is Dirtlove Records.&nbsp; Generally, however, the sheer amount of work I produce
    must be &quot;self-released&quot; on cassette.&nbsp; I once thought I should hold on to a
    lot of the best material for eventual CD release but now I don't care and am happy to
    remain a cassette artist.&nbsp; I'd release my entire catalog on CD and flood the market
    if I had the money.&nbsp; It's kinda like some sort of deluded artistic blackmail or
    industrial espionage fantasy, like threatening the give cassettes titles like &quot;New
    Soundtracks for Sony Playstation&quot; or &quot;Themes for Microsoft Employees.&quot;</small><br>
    <br>
    <em><strong>THE NZ SOUND</strong></em><br>
    <small><strong>Crude</strong>: Oh yes -- the NZ sound.&nbsp; Isolation, innovation,
    NZ-made gear, and all that f'ing attitude.</small><br>
    <br>
    <em><strong>AUDIENCE</strong></em><br>
    <small><strong>Crude</strong>: I try my best to discourage New Zealanders to attend my
    gigs, and frankly, subversive brainwashing soundscapes are all I'm interested in
    presenting to live audiences.&nbsp; Kinda like Tony Conrad's &quot;seminars&quot; or
    something.&nbsp; The way I distribute cassettes of late has been sloganed &quot;Art,
    Finitude and Micromarketing.&quot;&nbsp; Some Americans have my tapes -- occasionally I
    get the odd $5 and an encouraging comment, but other than that I don't even understand the
    concept of &quot;audience.&quot;</small><br>
    <br>
    <em><strong>ART AND AESTHETICS</strong></em><br>
    <small><strong>Crude</strong>: I am fond of geometric designs, occult motifs, official
    documents, pornography, world maps, French adverts from the 50s, corporate slogans,
    archaic illustrations of musical instruments (especially woodwinds), and electronic
    read-outs.&nbsp; This sort of visual stimuli certainly does complement a lot of Crude
    material.</small><br>
