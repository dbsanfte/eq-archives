    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Leeches are usually small and flat.&nbsp; They tend to
    cling to smooth stones with their circular &quot;sucker&quot;.&nbsp; Leeches generally
    have the appearance of being segmented, with the lines running perpendicular to the length
    of their body.&nbsp; They move by extending and contracting their tough muscular bodies,
    so they appear quite long.&nbsp; Do not confuse these with the flat soft-bodied planaria;
    leeches are your basic, run of the mill, parasites.&nbsp; Approach them with extreme
    caution.<br>
