    Thomas may be the most criminally ignored force in the Kansas City music scene. Hit the
    Hurricane in Westport, find the nearest disco-addicted weekend lesbian and ask, &quot;who
    the fuck is Ian Thomas?&quot; and you won't find out. Hit Davey's Uptown, find the first
    black-tee-shirt-clad hessian making devil-horns to Cretin 66 or Parlay and ask, &quot;who
    the fuck is Ian Thomas?&quot; You still won't learn anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That's because
    Thomas is the Quasimodo of the Kansas City music scene. Others go for the flash, the
    glory, the noise, the chicks and the big bucks. Thomas has put his independent record
    label to work out of love. And he really doesn't care if you know his name. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>Although he has
    retired from performing his own music, Thomas provided tracks for two tribute albums
    devoted to members of Guided By Voices. As The Vulture Club, Thomas contributed a
    psychedelic four-track version of GBV's &quot;Are You Faster&quot; to the <i>My Big Day</i>
    Jimmy Pollard tribute album. It is currently available in MP3 format at: <a

&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>Thomas also
    contributed an acoustic version of &quot;Scissors&quot; to the Tobin Sprout tribute album <i>I,
    Tobot</i>, originally released on CD-R from Economy Island Records and now available in

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Funded with
    overtime hours and the sale of precious musical equipment, Thomas' label, Mental
    Telemetry, is a case study in do-it-yourself, grass-roots independent rock. The label
    recently released a single by Guided By Voices off-shoot The Terrifying Experience. The
    single has sold out through Mental Telemetry's distributors, and more releases are in the
    works. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I've known
    Thomas peripherally for several years but I've never bothered to dig around inside his
    head until now. What I learned was that Thomas is a far cry from what I thought an
    aspiring record company mogul was: he's conscientious, articulate, and he epitomizes an
    ethic I thought was dead and gone. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This interview
    was conducted over several e-mails and is reprinted here verbatim.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What's Mental
    Telemetry's focus...more or less so-called indie-rock?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There's
    &quot;independent rock&quot; in the context that relates to Mental Telemetry, and then
    there's the genre of independent rock, or indie-rock. Mental Telemetry is an independent
    record label by design...We're operating without help or influence from larger entities,
    that this entire operation is completely self-contained and motivated. On the other hand,
    my interests lie very far from the actual genre of indie-rock. I consider Mental Telemetry
    more of an underground or &quot;outsiders&quot; label with my focus being not so much on
    specific genres, but on releasing recordings that are unconventional and interesting.
    Therefore, I would definitely release a good spoken word album or say, a psychedelic
    country album, if something like that was to catch my attention, and I dig what is going
    on there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There are
    thousands of independent record labels. Why start up another one?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There are tons
    of interesting small labels putting stuff out these days and I've asked myself the
    question &quot;why start one up?&quot; many times. Starting a record label was just
    something that I've always wanted to do, something that I've felt compelled to do for a
    long time. A lot of inspiration came from some of my favorite punk and underground labels
    such as Crass, Alternative Tentacles, Touch 'N Go, Datapanik, Siltbreeze, Xpressway,
    Dischord, and so on. Labels like these both inspired me and infected me with their
    independent spirits. In a way, I guess I'm sort of paying homage to that entire aesthetic
    -- the beliefs/systems that these labels helped create and prolong. Aside from that,
    Mental Telemetry gives me an opportunity to work with artists that I profoundly respect
    and admire, which is really great. Setting the &quot;business&quot; of things aside, I'm
    still a music fan and it's just nice to be able to reach people this way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When did you
    launch the label?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Mental Telemetry
    has been active since about January of last year and our first release was issued in
    February of last year. I tried a number of times in the early &#145;90s to get a record
    label started. But most of those attempts were thwarted because there was either little
    money or little interest. After my first attempts to start a label failed, I basically
    holed up and began studying all of the processes involved in manufacturing records and
    running a label. I also tried to realize a clearly defined goal for the label that I hoped
    to create. Which brings us to where I am right now with Mental Telemetry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So how did you
    hook up with the Terrifying Experience?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I hooked up with
    the Terrifying Experience pretty conventionally, but how I got them to do the record will
    always be a favorite story of mine. I'd been a fan of the Terrifying Experience ever since
    Mitch Mitchell parted ways with Guided by Voices. I really wanted to do something for
    Mitch and the Terrifying Experience, and I also thought it would be great to launch the
    label with them. I just wrote Mitch up one day and asked if he would be interested. I sent
    him a postcard, which pictures of Sonny Bono sporting a tennis outfit, pointing at the
    recipient. Printed in big bold letters over Sonny's head was the phrase &quot;I WANT
    YOU!&quot; I think it was a few weeks later that I got the E-mail from Mitch saying they
    wanted to do the single! So to make a long story short, I sent Mitch and the guys a big
    bottle of the best bourbon I could find and the rest is history; they released the
    &quot;Anvil Jumper&quot; single with me. I always like to think we closed the deal with
    that bottle of bourbon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Are you making
    any money or is this a labor of love?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Unfortunately,
    the label is not paying for itself at this point; it is a serious labor of love for me.
    Not only have I sold nearly everything I owned to start Mental Telemetry, but I've also
    worked insane hours of overtime at my day job to keep the cash flowing. I hope to keep the
    release schedule going -- and maybe eventually, the label will begin to break even
    financially. I would really like to break even so I could release records without worrying
    about where the money is coming from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Do you see this
    going somewhere money-wise, as in &quot;fuck yes I get to quit my job now!&quot; or do you
    plan on keeping this as more of a hobby-type project?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I'd be lying if
    I told you I wouldn't mind quitting my day job and running the label full time. It's great
    fun, and I'd love to wake up to it every morning, but I don't see that happening soon.
    Living off of Mental Telemetry is really not a priority for me, and I believe a choice
    like that might ultimately hurt the label rather than help it. After all, my day job has
    been keeping everything going thus far. I'd love to eventually have the freedom to run
    M-Tel full time, and I'm optimistic about being able to do that someday. Things would have
    to be going very well before I took such a big risk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What's the
    biggest challenge you face? Money?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There are many
    challenges facing a label of this size. However, the biggest challenge is definitely
    financial -- everything else seems to tie into finances or they pale in comparison. For
    example, I can't sell records unless I advertise and I can't advertise unless I sell
    records; small distributors may not carry our catalog because we are unknown and larger
    distributors won't carry us because we're small or because we are working with
    lesser-known artists. However, I do feel that a lot of these challenges are essential to
    Mental Telemetry's growth and that many of them will be eliminated with a little
    perseverance, ingenuity and time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So there's no
    financial reward...what is rewarding about running Mental Telemetry?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Being able to
    release great recordings and work with some of my favorite musicians are definitely the
    most rewarding aspects of running Mental Telemetry. I suppose if I was more concerned with
    turning a profit I might not feel fulfilled at this point, but that's entirely not the
    case. Just doing this is reward enough. Plus, seeing all of my hard work and effort turn
    into something after all of these years is a nice bonus too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">How do you
    promote a small record label?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Promotion and
    advertising for Mental Telemetry have been pretty low-key at this point. I like to keep
    attention focused on the music, not so much on the label itself -- and that's where I've
    spent much of my energy lately. It's an interesting balancing act. Most of my promotional
    efforts to date could be described as grass roots or guerilla style. I don't have a lot of
    money to funnel into advertising, so I've relied on friends of the label who help promote
    releases within their home regions. And then there's always word of mouth. I've done
    things like photocopy small handbills with label/release information, then slip those
    inside free weekly papers. I've also done typical things like sending loads of promotional
    records and letters out to small press and college/pirate radio. But again, it's been a
    very grass roots effort and only time will tell how well it all works out. For future
    promotions I've considered hijacking a city billboard, hiring a brigade of bicycling
    megaphonists and having a Mental Telemetry Day parade&#133;The mayor still hasn't returned
    my phone calls for this one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What's the
    feedback been like so far?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">All of the
    feedback I've received has been very encouraging, and that means the world to me. I get a
    lot of support from fans, family, friends, and the artists themselves, which makes those
    days of coming back from the post office empty handed still seem worthwhile. Ordering has
    been a bit slow through mail order, which probably has everything to do with the fact that
    we're not equipped for online ordering. Stepping through into the E-commerce realm is just
    not financially possible at this point in time, so we sell mostly through distributors who
    are equipped for online sales. Our first release, the Terrifying Experience single, has
    completely sold out through our distributors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    hope it's only a matter of time before people feel inspired to order directly from the
    label. I definitely prefer a more one on one interaction with people as opposed to selling
    through distributors and record shops, because all I see in that situation are numbers and
    not names. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Any press
    attention?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Mental Telemetry
    itself hasn't received any press that I know of. However, our debut release, a single by
    Dayton, Ohio's Terrifying Experience, has received some press in alternative music papers
    and online magazines. As far as more accessible press, this single was reviewed in Magnet
    Magazine recently, which is pretty big for us and I've heard we might see a review in CMJ
    as well. I'm truly hoping the small press will get interested soon because there's a lot
    of support for smaller labels there. As far as seeking press for the label is concerned, I
    don't like to create a lot of hype around myself. I owe it to the artists to spread the
    word about their releases and I fully intend to do that, but I'd rather achieve notoriety
    through subtlety and not flamboyance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What labels do
    you admire? Who do you look to for inspiration?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I admire and
    draw inspiration from so many labels that it's hard narrowing it down to a few, but I'll
    try to list a handful of my favorite contemporary labels and discuss them a bit...I'd
    encourage anyone reading to seek out releases from these labels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Siltbreeze is a
    damn fine label out of Philadelphia, their output has been top-notch since day one. Over
    the yeas, Siltbreeze has released recordings from artists such as Angus Maclise (original
    drummer for the Velvet Underground), Jim Shepard (late Ohio artist/poet/musician, founder
    of Vertical Slit and V3), The Dead C (beautiful discord by way of New Zealand) and a long
    list of many other brilliant artists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Datapanik is now
    a defunct punk label from Ohio, who I've always admired for their &quot;instant&quot;
    (read: cheap) approach to releasing records. Datapanik albums usually came in photocopied
    or screen-printed sleeves and occasionally they had handwritten labels, all of their stuff
    had a real personal feel to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Xpressway was an
    underground label from New Zealand run by Bruce Russell. Xpressway has been out of
    operation for quite a while now. But in my opinion, it's one of the most important
    underground labels to ever exist. X/Way was incredibly prolific throughout its run and
    released many great recordings from New Zealand, too many to properly give them justice
    here. Most of X/Way's releases were issued on cassette and done in relatively small,
    handmade editions - all of them beautifully done. Bruce eventually shut down X/Way because
    it had met its original intention of exposing New Zealand artists to an international
    audience. Bruce now runs Corpus Hermeticum, an excellent CD label that follows in the
    Xpressway tradition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Mental Telemetry
    distributes another label, Minutewax...how does Minutewax differ from M-Tel?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I treat the
    Minutewax label as a separate entity from Mental Telemetry, although it still functions
    under the same basic principles and ideals. Minutewax is more of an &quot;instant&quot;
    label. What I mean by that is I don't have to spend a lot of time and money to make
    releases happen. All of the recordings that are coming out on Minutewax will be done in
    small limited editions (anywhere from 50 to 100 copies per release) and issued on the CD-R
    format only. The basic premise here is identical to many underground and punk cassette
    labels that have flourished over the years, I'm just utilizing a newer technology, CD-R.
    There's more freedom involved by doing things this way as well. If a release doesn't sell
    many copies, it will not ultimately affect the label's output. Honestly the initial drive
    behind Minutewax was to keep me busy during the interim between Mental Telemetry releases.
    But it's beginning to take on a life of it's own, which is very exciting. I don't know
    where the future will take Minutewax, but ultimately, I'd like to showcase some of the
    more unusual blues roots music that's going on here in Kansas City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">You're an
    extremely talented musician...but it's my understanding that you're more or less retired
    from the performing side. What led to your decision to step behind the scenes, so to
    speak?<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">My decision to
    stop writing, recording and playing my own music was a very difficult one, but it just
    seemed like the right time to give it up. After nearly a decade of doing my own home
    recordings and experimenting with rather loud instruments, I've developed a nagging case
    of tinnitus in my left ear. The tinnitus was one reason I thought it better to stop now,
    while I still have my hearing intact. I then decided to sell all of my instruments and
    recording equipment to help raise money for Mental Telemetry. Of course, I don't want it
    to sound like I quit only because of this ringing in my ear or to start up my own record
    label. I had also grown quite disillusioned with much of today's independent music and
    figured the easiest way to change anything would be to change it from the inside. I also
    did not want to continue on my own musical paths, because they were becoming less
    interesting to me, less challenging to me and too conformed for my own tastes. One can
    only take so many lonely malcontents, bashing away at various instruments in their
    basements and recording it all to a four-track, before it becomes completely redundant and
    boring. There are many talented people out there who are much better at doing that type of
    shit than I am.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    style="font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Music has been
    one of the only constants in my life for as long as I can remember. Some of my very first
    childhood memories are of my father playing music while I sat in my crib. At the time I
    was too young to know what it was, but on a daily basis he would play stuff like the
    Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Doors, Thin Lizzy and the Velvet Underground. So I literally
    grew up listening to all of this stuff and I know it has made a deep impression on who I
    am today; the music was always there. My dad was also a pretty big record collector
    himself and I think I've picked up much of my rock and roll &quot;romanticism&quot;
    because of that as well. At a very early age I can remember sitting down with my dad's
    vinyl records, studying the covers, reading the liner notes, looking at the pictures and
    wondering how it was all done. I didn't begin dreaming about running my own label until I
    discovered punk music and got caught up in seeking out these strange and unknown bands on
    obscure record labels. At the time, I felt a lot of those punk and underground records
    were being made just for me, like they were speaking just to me, which is what initially
    sparked my interest in putting out records. I longed to be a part of that, because those
    records made me feel like I belonged somewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
