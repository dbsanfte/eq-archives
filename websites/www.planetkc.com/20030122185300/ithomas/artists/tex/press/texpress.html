    Mitchell played guitar in the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of GBV, but with his band The
    Terrifying Experience he's been following a wholly different path. More in line with the
    Stooges-influenced dirty punk of Ohioan bands like Prisonshake and Cobra Verde than GBV's
    eccentric arena rock, The Terrifying Experience blast through 15 tracks of loud-as-hell,
    straightforward rock and roll on their latest CD <i>Magnetic Breakthrough</i>. While the
    most striking part of their music is the guitar sound (big, crisp and raging), here and
    there they'll surprise you with an almost-pop melody or with a switch in genre, as with
    the bluesy &quot;The Road to Hell&quot; or the lazy, Meat Puppets-ish dreamer &quot;From
    Chariots to Garbage Cans.&quot; And while the vocals are relatively low in the mix, Mitch
    Mitchell has a quite sensitive singing voice, one that balances nicely with the rolling
    thunder of rock that the band delivers. I hope this CD can break out of the
    &quot;GBV-related&quot; category and reach a wider swath of rock fans, because at this
    point the GBV comparison is irrelevant and will just lead people to false conclusions and
    misguided expectations. All in all, what's here is plain and simple, little analysis
    needed: it's rock and roll, delivered straight to you, without any pretense, posing or
    slick production.</small></font><br>

    <small>Old school Ohio punk-rooted rock. Old as in splitting the difference between the
    Dead Boys, the Pagans and one of those Raspberries-influenced bands that got lumped in
    with the punks until someone started using the term New Wave and its Who-derived buddy,
    power pop. So you get mid-tempo to fast stuff &#150; but not hardcore fast &#150; with
    thick slabs of Gibson-through-Marshall-stack roar leavened with sturdy melodies riding the
    riffs or thrown up over them via voice. The guy who put the band together, Mitch Mitchell,
    has done time in Guided by Voices but it&#146;s the difference between, say, King&#146;s X
    and Pantera, or The Dickies and the Ramones, or No Use For A Name and New Bomb Turks... Or
    a huge box of assorted, multi-layer truffles and a life-size bust of Lemmy made from 30
    lbs. of Hershey&#146;s chocolate, with a quart of whiskey to wash it down. This is a good
    CD. I&#146;d pay money for it, and the last new CD I paid money for was Judas
    Priest&#146;s <i>Hell Bent For Leather.</i> I did get The Gathering&#146;s <i>How to
    Measure A Planet?</i> used though. Thanks for askin&#146;.</small><br>

    Very cool, satisfying anthemic, intelligent punk rock stuff that reminds me of all the old
    fart shit like NAKED RAYGUN, RUIN, WIPERS and even ELECTRIC FRANKENSTEIN. They've got the
    guitar firepower but also some interesting song structures, melodies and even some
    excursions into psychedelicisms (all the crap old codgers like). Makes for an interesting
    stew for me as far as I'm concerned. Does some of this stuff even sound like RUSH? Maybe.

    The Terrifying Experience is rather the opposite of their name, providing a varied view of
    straight up rock music. Fronted by former Guided by Voices guitarist, Mitch Mitchell, you
    can pretty much guess the direction this is heading. And while it does skirt the edges of
    the former frontman's outfit, it's brief, yet enjoyable when it does happen
    (&quot;Universal Sheep Coma&quot;, &quot;Elizabeth and Mercury&quot;). Primarily, the
    Terrifying Experience is a rock outfit that houses punk energies that almost seems to
    careen at breakneck speeds from time to time (&quot;Woodshed Fist Fight&quot;, &quot;The
    Road to Hell&quot;). I guess to sum up the sound of the Terrifying Experience, try and
    imagine what would happen if Guided By Voices got rough, dirty and edgy. Personally, as a
    nominal Guided By Voices fan, the nods to the former outfit made this album pretty cool in
    my book. The times when The Terrifying Experience picked up the pace and started to rock
    at mach speeds were also rad and got my foot tapping, but sometimes bordered on silly (the
    lyrics to &quot;The Road to Hell&quot; are rather childish). Overall, however, this is a
    quality rock album.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><small>Mental Telemetry's last Terrifying
    Experience release revealed a more subdued side to the band. As I listened to that
    7&quot;, I wondered if the Experience had decided to go soft on me, throwing in their
    abrasive licks for a more refined pop approach. As the feedback on <i>Magnetic
    Breakthrough</i>'s opening track squeals uncontrollably, it's quite clear that the
    Experience has plenty of muscle left in their Marshall stacks. As a matter of fact, the
    band's latest release falls somewhere in between feral psychedelic punk and overdriven
    rock, crossing back and forth between each genre regularly. Several tunes remind me of
    Cleveland's The Pagans, without that legendary band's over-the-top vocals, as gritty
    guitar licks brusquely drive home the point that distortion is still king. Piano, acoustic
    guitar and even a drum machine-inspired techno number follow, giving you a brief break
    from the band's deafening sound. Overall, though, The Terrifying Experience has dispensed
    another round of raucous vocals, amps cranked up to 10 and staggering riffs that'll make
    eardrums bleed and have you smashing up your parents' furniture in a fit of rock-fueled
    rage.</small></font><br>

    Former Guided By Voices guitarist Mitch Mitchell and company churn out high-octane tunes
    with the &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy: they find a cool riff and ride it for the
    entire song. Distorted guitars and singing -- not screaming -- on some tracks recall the
    glory days of Husker Du. &quot; Universal Sheep Coma&quot; shows these guys can strip away
    the distortion and still pull it off.&nbsp; TE also includes an electroncia instrumental
    midway through the CD to keep you guessing.</font></p>

    Who would have known that Dayton, Ohio could produce such enjoyable little scamps? These
    boys have a fine taste for bands such as Man Or Astro-Man?, but with fine vocal
    capabilities. A lackadaisical attitude around the microphone merely adds to the band's
    driving sound. While not exactly screaming their way through songs, the band are certainly
    pointed. And it makes them that much more enjoyable. They know their way around a cool
    lick and aren't afraid to use it. It's like shoe gazers that actually got up some
    gumption. !!!! Keith Carman</small></p>

    <p align="left"><small>This double dose of The Terrifying Experience catches the band's
    dirty guitar-led pop melodies in fine form. Less abrasive then previous releases, the two
    songs on this 7&quot; put a classic 70s rock feel into the year 2000, producing an
    up-to-date combination of rockin' riffage and familiar pop melodies that can attract a
    diverse crowd. The vocals are turned up on both songs, placing the chorus-heavy melodies
    at the forefront as the band drives home the message that loud rock can indeed be cool in
    the indie arenas of the world. Supposedly from the band's upcoming CD, these two songs are
    a good indication that another daunting Terrifying Experience will be well<small> </small>received.</small></p>

    released three singles, an EP, and two full-lengths that have garnered only a fraction of
    the attention afforded the solo records for Tobin Sprout and Robert Pollard.&nbsp; The
    second of those LP's, <i>Magnetic Breakthrough</i>, is the first to feature drummer Mark
    Dean, formerly of Columbus legends Pica Huss.&nbsp; Dean has sparked some renewed spitfire
    in the band, and <em>Magnetic</em> is an inspired album of diverse allure. &nbsp;
    &quot;Anvil Jumper&quot; is a potent three minutes of cataclysm, while
    &quot;Leprechaun&quot; is propelled by a driving bassline and riff.&nbsp; GBV fans will
    most likely find &quot;Elizabeth and Mercury,&quot; which resembles <em>Bee Thousand's </em>quieter
    moments, most appealing; however more than anything <i>Magnetic Breakthrough </i>makes it
    plain that not all the songwriting talent of that band resided with Pollard and Sprout.</small></font></p>

    unadorned, hardened guitar sound that blends the gravity of Detroit rock with the pace of
    American style punk, but with variable melodic edges to it.&nbsp; At least, that's where
    this second full length CD heads, with occasional piano, acoustic guitar and even some
    half serious techno effects.&nbsp; It's a bit Radio Birdman (Woodshed Fist Fight), a bit
    Hüsker Dü (The Tearful Champion), and even a bit Guided By Voices (Universal Sheep
