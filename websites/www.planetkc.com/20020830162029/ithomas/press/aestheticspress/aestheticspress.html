    AESTHETICS &quot;OFF&quot;</small><br>
    <small>BY ANDREW MAGILOW</small><br>
    <small><em>SPLENDID EZINE </em>(2/22/02)</small></strong><br>
    <big><br>
    </big><small>Certain bands take you back through music's past. When Rancid first hit the
    scene, people reminisced about hearing the early Clash. The Casualties suggest mid-period
    Exploited. The Strokes may even bring to mind a certain early Seattle-raised garage band
    called The Sonics. Is all music cyclical, with contemporary copycats repeatedly modifying
    existing musical patterns to update their sound for modern-day listening standards? Is
    there anything out there that's still truly original? It's a world of rhetorical
    questions, ain't it? </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><small>The Aesthetics call certain bands to
    mind as well, though unless you have a penchant for noisy New Zealand schlock, you'll
    forget their names as soon as you read them. But for those of you who are either &quot;in
    the know&quot; or just sub-par record collecting losers like me, there are definite
    strains of King Loser, Trash and even an inkling of The Dead C spilling from The
    Aesthetics' lips. This all boils down to a musical cauldron of damaged noise that mixes
    peppery garage-rock rhythms with anti-climatic, post-punk improvisation, creating an
    overcooked broth that will leave some listeners kvetching and others anxiously scrambling
    for more. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><small>Having done time in such relative
    unknowns as Dimmer and his own solo project, Crude, local eccentric Matt Middleton formed
    The Aesthetics in 1995. While the band has progressed from cassette-only releases to
    full-length CDs, The Aesthetics still prefer their recordings to be harsh, scummy
    garage-flavored rockers. Using plenty of overdriven instruments, Middleton, Kraus and Fyfe
    tear through <i>Off</i> with energetic screaming, rugged rhythms and a sloppy swagger that
    suits anyone looking for a glaring upheaval of standard musical thoroughfare.
    &quot;Sufi&quot; blends pseudo-free jazz saxophone squawking with a rash of yelping guitar
    notes and a slew of noisy sludge, belittling any hopes of establishing a recognizable
    beat. Muffled low-end bass and fiendish words zip past your ears on the startling
    seven-minute epic &quot;The Idiot Team&quot;, as looped samples and phasers are injected
    into the mix, creating a particularly irritating masterpiece. Taking the distorted mayhem
    motif to the extreme, The Aesthetics include two live numbers that are equivalent to a
    hyperactive Daniel Johnston recklessly exorcising himself of inner demons with the help of
    the finest extra-lo-fi equipment. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><small>The Aesthetics aren&#146;t for
    everyone. Quite frankly, they&#146;re not for <i>most</i> people; the majority of musical
    curiosity seekers will desperately seek some semblance of aural familiarity -- and will
    leave empty-handed. And while there are certain influences sporadically spread across <i>Off</i>,
    it&#146;s quite difficult to associate this CD with anything cyclical ­- there&#146;s
    simply too much instability and feedback-laden noise to remind one of anything except the
    jackhammering construction crew outside your window. If you&#146;re in need of a good
    musical enema, The Aesthetics will hastily purge your record collection of any unnecessary
    rock &#145;n roll parasites that may mercilessly prowl your shelves.</small></font><br>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b>The Aesthetics, <i>Off<br>
    </i><small>BY DAVE HEATON</small><br>
    <small><em>ERASING CLOUDS #7 </em>(October 2001)</small></b><br>
    <br>
    <small>Call it sub-sub-sub rock, if you will; The Aesthetics' <i>Off</i> sounds like it
    was recorded in another land somewhere deep under ground. The songs are weird bluesy
    guitar rock but <i>everything</i> is distorted beyond belief, making it seem absolutely
    arcane, something miles away from what your average person on the street would think of as
    rock. A trio from New Zealand, led by prolific eccentric Matt Middleton, The Aesthetics
    make music that is downright strange: lo-fi rock fueled by a desire to mess with every
    sound at every step. Songs like &quot;Sufi&quot; sound in part like a sort of punk-rock
    version of out-there jazz, with the same freeness about it. Other tracks, especially
    &quot;The Idiot Team,&quot; wear an extra layer of noise over them from start to finish.
    The slower, more spacey &quot;Imbroglio&quot; sounds like a rock song that has been
    partially destroyed, like big parts of it are missing. The vocals everywhere are nearly
    impossible to understand on first listen, and the music is also often hard to get your
    bearings with at first. Too extreme for your average person (your Best Buy shopper), <i>Off</i>
    is baffling but also exciting, a living work of art which shifts around in ways you won't
    expect. Listeners in search of a challenge shouldn't turn away, <i>Off</i> is a unique
    musical adventure.</small><br>

    <small><small><small><small><em>THE WIRE</em>&nbsp; (Issue 215, January 2002)</small></small></small></small></span></h1>
    <p align="left"><small><span lang="EN-GB">While New Zealand regularly throws up some of
    the best heavy drone and freeform noise discs on the planet, it&#146;s been a while since
    they produced any worthwhile rock &#146;n&#146; roll.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>You have to go as far back as the early Flying Nun singles, speaker wrecking stuff
    like The Clean&#146;s first few EPs, to mainline that kind of energy.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then out of the blue comes this, Matt
    Middleton&#146;s Aesthetics, a wild trio who specialise in lo-fi bursts of snotty rock,
    complete with bleeding electronics and three note guitar riffs that could&#146;ve come
    straight out of the tombs of Cleveland.<br>
    <br>
    Middleton&#146;s CV is all over the place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
    former member of Shayne Carter&#146;s Dimmer, he also plays under a variety of different
    group names.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether he&#146;s roaring
    through a free jazz inspired tangle or building streaming towers of squeakily industrial
    electronics, they all share an obsessional punk-noise aesthetic.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As Crude, he recorded for Flying Nun and cut the
    deranged Refute A Myth Society for Ecstatic Yod&#146;s Ass-Run series.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Aesthetics are Middleton on guitar, vocals and
    synth, Pat Krauss on &#147;big boom boom drums and attitude&#148; and &#145;Fyfe&#146; on
    &#147;Bad ol&#146; bass, software, hardware and morale&#148;.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They blast off with &#147;Store Card 60&#148;,
    which sounds like a benign take on the fuck-you pogo of Cleveland&#146;s Electric Eels,
    with Middleton&#146;s cheap fuzz riffing suggesting The Damned&#146;s Captain Sensible on
    helium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though iced with Middleton&#146;s
    endearingly wayward singing, later tracks are more steeped in electronics, recalling early
    Mute or Rough Trade ventures into bedroom circuitry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>With prime garage punk riffs sunk in tape hiss and distortion, Off is an
    exhilarating ride.</span><br>

    time on the fledgling Missouri imprint Mental Telemetry. &nbsp; <em>Off </em>offers what
    we've come to expect from these guys, demented ear-bending rock intensity along the lines
    of Chrome, performed within the farthest outskirts of the traditional song structure and
    with lo-fi aesthetics on their sleeves.&nbsp; </small></font></p>
