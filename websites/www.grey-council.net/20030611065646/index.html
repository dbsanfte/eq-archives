				GC has been going through a lot of changes in the past month. We are now a guild of about 35. We are more oriented to human relationships, having fun, and retaining the values that GC always has had. We "play how you like" in terms of doing raiding, quests, levels, tradeskills and lots of other things. About half of our folks are casual players and the other half play a lot. We are no longer a major raiding guild. Since a lot of information on our web site is incorrect (we're working on upgrading it!) please check our forums for the latest information. Applicants should look on the Applications board for where to send their applications. We want to thank the many friends of GC who have been helpful to us during this transition. If you have any questions, contact the interim Guild Leader (me) at gcxevbusiness@aol.com -- thanks. <br>

				An Ogre Chorus Line

It’s always been a dream of mine
To see an ogre chorus line
I’d pay big money for the chance
To line them up and watch them dance

They would shimmy and shake their groove thing
Accompanied by a bard, who’d sing
And all in attendance would gape in awe
At the fantastic site that they just saw

And when the ogres complete their jig
They’d move on to their next gig
The crowd would roar as they turn to go
In appreciation of the stupendous show

And above the rest, I would be glad
Thankful for the chance I had
To watch them dance and shake their stuff
And I could never get enough

So come on now, my ogre friends
Do for me those twists and bends
Shake it up for all to see
Fulfill this wizards fantasy!

Lala 


....

A happy holiday season to one and all from the members and friends of the Grey Council

peace

We had a hate run, and did the escort the gnome quest for a giggle, and some epic fights.. and that's most of it I think.<br>

Congrats Alun on fist of lightning (damn that thing is scary) and Groob on Mask of Sky from Eashen.. and congrats Tullik and Cartesian (SR guy who joined us) on Boots from Iki, and Verm on Iki mask.

				Nothin else up to kill, so Vindi drew the short straw. To be honest, at one point I thought we were in trouble, but a great MT switch, and a good job of tankmezzing his pet, left Vindi face down, us dancing, and Qinn wearing some nice new boots.
