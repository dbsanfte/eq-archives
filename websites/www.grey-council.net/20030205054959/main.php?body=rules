Grey Council is a guild of friends that role play in the world of Norrath to enjoy their leisure time. In our members we value friendship, loyalty, honesty, maturity, and generosity above all else. We expect all our members to uphold this set of values, and we have a few rules designed to make this goal easier for us all. <br>

<br>

Before you consider joining Grey Council, you should be completely sure that you can abide by the following:
<ol>
<li><b>Do nothing to harm the good name of the Grey Council.</b>
<li><b>Treat your guildmates, and other people with respect.</b>
<li><b>Behave in a manner befitting an adult (even if you're not one)</b>
<li><b>Keep GC a pleasant guild to be in.</b>
<li><b>Do not be greedy: people are more important than things.</b>
</ol>

These are explained in more depth below, but essentially those are the guiding principles of our Guild, and should be followed in spirit, and used as a yardstick to guide your actions.
<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
<b>1. Do nothing to harm the good name of the Grey Council.</b>
<br><br>
Don't get into public fights or heated arguments, on message boards or in game, and represent the Guild well at all times, in groups, as guests on other raids or as hosts on our raids.
<br><br>
<b>2. Treat your guildmates, and other people in EverQuest, with respect.</b>
<br><br>
Don't insult anyone based on race, religion, nationality, gender, or sexual orientation, even in jest. Don't threaten, bully or abuse your guildmates or people you meet.
<br><br>
<b>3. Behave like an Adult</b>
<br><br>
We have no age limit on people joining GC. However, we expect all members, whatever their age or background, to behave like adults.
Do not have a short temper. Do not blow up when criticized. Do not be so insecure you must be handled with kid gloves. This is our hobby, not our job. If it's hard work dealing with you, we don't want to.
<br><br>
<b>4. Keep GC a pleasant guild to be in.</b>
<br><br>
Don't try and cajole/bully/guilt-trip people into performing services for you, or doing things they don't enjoy.
<br><br>
Do not complain about loot/how much your class sucks/how much your gear sucks/how your guildmates don't raid enough/raid too much/how life in EQ is too hard. This is a game, not Dear Abby. If we want to hear people complain we will visit our grandmothers. 
<br><br>
Watch your language in /gu.
<br><br>
<b>5. Do Not Be Greedy; people are more important than things.</b>
<br><br>
On GC raids, and in general in GC groups, mains ALWAYS take precedence over alts. Unless no-one present will use an item as an upgrade, need before greed always applies. Only roll if you WILL use (not just if you can). If you use a different system in a private group, make sure all present are happy with it.
<br><br>
Loot is distributed on GC raids according to the rules laid out by the raid leader. We often use a partial merit system on large raids, but some raids are on a random (or semi-random) basis. Applicants and/or new members may not be considered as heavily for merit based loot.
<br><br>
If you upgrade an item on a GC raid, pass on the item you upgraded to a guildmate if they need it.
<br><br>
If you gain an item you need on a guild raid, and later get an upgrade for that item through whatever method, return the original item to the guild.
<br><br>
If you upgraded an item on your own and a main could your hand-me-down, you are encouraged to seriously consider loaning it to them. If they're stronger, we're all stronger.
<br><br>
If you're in doubt, and you think you're being greedy, always err on the side of generosity.
<br><br>
As a final note: Epic quest assistance is not given until the member reaches full member status and (with the exception of cleric and enchanter epics) is level 55 or higher.
<br><br>
Epic quest assistance for alts is not given under any circumstances, official or otherwise. Don't even ask.
