Our application process may seem long, but it is our way of ensuring that those who join GC are 
compatible with our values and philosophies. GC is a guild of friends, and friendship doesn't 
happen overnight!

<b>The Application Process</b><br><br>
The four stages of Grey Council membership are as follows: Applicant, Trial Member, Initiate, Full Member.
<br><br>
<b>Becoming an applicant:</b> before posting an application, you must be either level 55+, or 
already have 5 full members willing to sponsor you, whose names you must post in your application.
<br><br>
You must be unguilded, and have no active applications with other guilds. You must post an 
official application on our board, and mail a copy of it to our recruitment officer, Grendl, at 
<a href="mailto:Gimmi_D_Bard@Hotmail.com">Gimmi_D_Bard@Hotmail.com</a>. Include your character 
name, class, level, and guild history (including 
why you left any previous guilds), and explain why you wish to join Grey Council.
<br><br>
You will be expected to group and raid with GC members as much as possible for at least a 1 month 
period, and must be appropriately equipped and prepared for any raids you attend. You will be 
given access to the Rush Committee forum and the GC applicant chat channel to assist in this. At 
the end of that period, your application will be reviewed by the Guild. If you did not have 5 
sponsors to begin with, at least 2 full
members must step forward to sponsor you in your review. At this time we may decide to guild you 
as a trial member, to extend your applicant period, or to deny your application.
<br><br>
Once guilded as a <b>Trial Member</b> you will be given access to the member only forums. Your 
period as 
a Trial Member typically lasts at least 1 month. Continue to raid and group with GC members as 
often as possible during this period, as we are still getting to know each other. At the end of 
your Trial Period, your application will again be reviewed. At this time your Trial Membership may 
be extended, you may be
promoted to Initiate, or your application may be denied. You must have 5 full member sponsors, and 
no significant negative feedback, to progress to Initiate.
<br><br>
As an <b>Initiate</b>, you are a regular member of the Grey Council. You may not, however, sponsor 
new 
members or receive guild assistance with your Epic Quest. After at least 1 month as an initiate, 
your progress will be reviewed. If a majority of officers
vote in favor of it, you will be granted full member status. If you do not have sufficient votes 
at that time, you will remain an initiate until the next review period.
<br><br>
Once you are a <b>Full Member</b>, you may sponsor applicants, and you may receive epic assistance 
for 
your main character as determined by the officers (full membership does not mean you are entitled 
to your epic. It just means we may help you according to our schedule and merit rules). You may 
only sponsor 2 applicants at once, and your sponsorship is in effect until they achieve full 
member status, so use it wisely.


<!--old rules-->
<!--<b>Notes:</b> There is no level limit to join GC! We accept folks of any age. However, since 
much 
of our application process involves grouping and raiding with other members, it is to an applicant's advantage to be of an appropriate raiding age. A large number of guild raids are 50+ and raids to certain select locations are 55+. Please contact an officer if you have specific questions about level-related issues.
<br><br>
Grey Council members are expected to adhere to a high standard of conduct - Read our <a href="main.php?body=rules"><b>Rules</b></a> section to find out more. If you don't think you can follow these rules, don't apply.<br>
<br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center>
<br>
<b>The Application Process</b><br><br>
The 3 stages of Grey Council membership are as follows: Applicant, Initiate, Full Member.
<br><br>
<b>Applicant</b>: To be considered an applicant to Grey Council you must A) be unguilded, B) post an official application on our <a href="http://www.greycouncil.org/applicantboard.php">application board</a>. Please don't have pending applications to other guilds while applying to GC. At the very least your application post should include: your character name, class, level, details of your past everquest experience, and your reasons for pursuing membership into the guild. At this time you should also send an email to our recruitment officer, Grendl, at <a href="mailto:Gimmi_D_Bard@Hotmail.com">Gimmi_D_Bard@Hotmail.com</a>, and notify him of your application.
<br><br>
Once considered an applicant you will be contacted by Grendl and asked to group and raid with the guild for a period of typically one month. This period will allow us to get to know you better and evaluate how well you fit in with other Grey Council members. It is expected that during this period you raid or group with us often enough for us to be able to make this determination - if you can't or do not your application period may be extended. Our application period may seem long, but it is our way of ensuring that those who join GC are compatible with our values and philosophies. GC is a guild of friends, and friendship doesn't happen overnight!
<br><br>
After sufficient exposure your application will be reviewed by the guild and two sponsors will be asked to step forward. Should you fail to meet the guild's requirements or lack initial sponsors your application can be dropped. Fulfilling these requirements grants you initiate status.
<br><br>
<b>Initiate</b>: As a Grey Council initiate you will be guilded as a trial member and given access to our private members forums. At the end of your trial period your membership will again be reviewed and an additional 3 sponsors will be required. If, at the end of this period, you fail to meet GC standards or do not have additional sponsorship you may be given an extended trial or completely removed from the guild. An initiate's trial period lasts on the average of 3-4 weeks.
<br><br>
<b>Full Member</b>: Once your trial period is passed you are granted with full membership into 
Grey Council. Full membership includes complete access to guild resources as well as the ability 
to sponsor initiates.-->
