Grey Council is a guild of friends that role play in the world of Norrath to enjoy their leisure time. In our members we value friendship, loyalty, honesty, maturity, and generosity above all else. We expect all our members to uphold this set of values, and we have a few rules designed to make this goal easier for us all. <br>

<br>

Before you consider joining Grey Council, you should be completely sure that you can abide by the following:
<ol>
<li><b>Do nothing to harm the good name of the Grey Council.</b>
<li><b>Treat your guildmates, and other people with respect.</b>
<li><b>Behave in a manner befitting an adult (even if you're not one)</b>
<li><b>Keep GC a pleasant guild to be in.</b>
<li><b>Do not be greedy: people are more important than things.</b>
</ol>

These are explained in more depth below, but essentially those are the guiding principles of our Guild, and should be followed in spirit, and used as a yardstick to guide your actions.
<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
<b>1. Do nothing to harm the good name of the Grey Council.</b>
<br><br>
Don't get into public fights or heated arguments, on message boards or in game, and represent the Guild well at all times, in groups, as guests on other raids or as hosts on our raids.
<br><br>
<b>2. Treat your guildmates, and other people in EverQuest, with respect.</b>
<br><br>
Don't insult anyone based on race, religion, nationality, gender, or sexual orientation, even in jest. Don't threaten, bully or abuse your guildmates or people you meet.
<br><br>
<b>3. Behave like an Adult</b>
<br><br>
We have no age limit on people joining GC. However, we expect all members, whatever their age or background, to behave like adults.
Do not have a short temper. Do not blow up when criticized. Do not be so insecure you must be handled with kid gloves. This is our hobby, not our job. If it's hard work dealing with you, we don't want to.
<br><br>
<b>4. Keep GC a pleasant guild to be in.</b>
<br><br>
Don't try and cajole/bully/guilt-trip people into performing services for you, or doing things they don't enjoy.
<br><br>
Do not complain about loot/how much your class sucks/how much your gear sucks/how your guildmates don't raid enough/raid too much/how life in EQ is too hard. This is a game, not Dear Abby. If we want to hear people complain we will visit our grandmothers. 
<br><br>
Watch your language in /gu.
<br><br>
<b>5. Do Not Be Greedy; people are more important than things.</b>
<br><br>
On GC raids, and in general in GC groups, mains ALWAYS take precedence over alts. Unless no-one present will use an item as an upgrade, need before greed always applies. Only roll if you WILL use (not just if you can). If you use a different system in a private group, make sure all present are happy with it.
<br><br>
Loot is distributed on GC raids according to the rules laid out by the raid leader. We often use a partial merit system on large raids, but some raids are on a random (or semi-random) basis. Applicants and/or new members may not be considered as heavily for merit based loot.
<br><br>
If you upgrade an item on a GC raid, pass on the item you upgraded to a guildmate if they need it.
<br><br>
If you gain an item you need on a guild raid, and later get an upgrade for that item through whatever method, return the original item to the guild.
<br><br>
If you upgraded an item on your own and a main could your hand-me-down, you are encouraged to seriously consider loaning it to them. If they're stronger, we're all stronger.
<br><br>
If you're in doubt, and you think you're being greedy, always err on the side of generosity.
<br><br>
As a final note: Epic quest assistance is not given until the member reaches full member status and (with the exception of cleric and enchanter epics) is level 55 or higher.
<br><br>
Epic quest assistance for alts is not given under any circumstances, official or otherwise. Don't even ask.

<!--
Grey Council is a guild of people that role play in the world of Norrath to enjoy their leisure time. They are also responsible for helping others as best they can by respecting others and following the rules set forth by the officers of Grey Council. Members of Grey Council (inductees and full members) must always be respectful of other players, be generous by nature and willing to work out any issues that might arise as best they can.
	<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
	Respect comes from treating people as you would like to be treated: helping someone that has lost their way, died to some unfortunate accident or just by giving them a simple spirit of wolf or portal if you can.
	<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
	A GC raid is two or more groups of GC with the majority of those 2 groups GC members.
	<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
	Being generous can take on many forms. If you gain a item you cannot use or is 'lower quality' than yours, you give it to active main GC member. On GC Raids, active mains always get looting preference over Alts. If you win a item on a GC raid and the item is on an alt of yours, loan it to an active main GC member if it is a upgrade for them until they can attain better. Any items given to you by a GC member that upgrades a item you have currently cannot be traded without first trying to see if someone else in GC can use. You also pass down any items you upgrade (no longer need) to an active main GC member.
	<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
	On most major raids GC uses a merit based loot system as determined by the raid leader - applicants or new guild members may not be considered for items as heavily as full members.
	<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
	Epic quest assistance, officially organized by the guild and its leaders, is not given until the member reaches full member status and is level 55 or higher. Certain cases might arise where level will not be taken into account (almost completed quest, very useful to guild such as cleric epic/etc). There are several reasons for this, one of which is there are just far too many people in GC to work on everyone's epic item without some sort of limit. Level limits will ensure that the player will be most effective with his/her epic weapon in guild raids.
	<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
	Grey Council cannot always provide everyone a group. This is the responsibility of the member. If no groups have an opening, create one!
	<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
	We do NOT sell to guildmembers.
	<br><br><center><img src="images/bullet.gif" border="0"></center><br><br>
	Grey Council's goal is to enjoy Everquest. We're not about killing the biggest mobs repeatedly to gain items as quickly as we can. We explore new areas as we become capable, slay beasts when the desire arises and help members complete their epic quests as we can.-->
