    <p>It had been seven years since Loral had retired from his days of adventure, but he had one last job to do.  Loral walked slowly around the cavern, carefully inspecting every detail of the large room. Any flaw in its construction could spell disaster for those within, and eventually all of Norrath. Two large ballistae, huge crossbows with bolts two meters long, were bolted to the floor corners of the room. Seeing these siege weapons in such a small room would make no sense to any outside observer, but to Loral, they were critically important. Loral checked the chains that ran across the floor ending at two huge stone wheels on the far end.  Loral looked to the two armored barbarians that stood to the sides of the large wheels, iron hammers slung over their shoulders.  He turned and looked to the two elves that manned the giant crossbows.  The resolve of these warriors would be more critical than the flawless engineering of the room and its furnishings. They were about to see something few mortals ever did, and fewer still ever lived to talk about it.</p>

    <p>Loral took out a black gem from a pouch on his belt. A single word activated the priceless gem, and once activated it could never be deactivated.  The huge crossbows, the unbreakable chains, and the strength of the warriors would all fail if the gem was not activated properly. Each was a piece of a large puzzle, each had to be put in at just the right time or they would all die.  Loral took a deep breath.  It was time to release Xuzl. Loral took the battered shield off of his back and set it in the center of the floor.</p>

    <p>"Awaken Xuzl. You are free."</p>

    <p>A vibration filled the room, rattling the chains on the floor and drawing concerned looks from the guards. The edge of the shield began to glow and then burst into flame. The circle expanded outward forming a large pool of fire. A sudden blast of hot air filled the room as the portal to the Plane of Fire opened.</p>

    <p>A red claw reached out of the pool and gripped the stone floor. Another claw followed the first and the two heaved up the rest of the demon's bulk from the pit. Xuzl's green eyes beheld the small priest.  The foolish priest had kept his word.  Xuzl was free.</p>

    <p>Upon blackened hooves, Xuzl stood above the fiery pit.  He stretched his full fifteen feet height expanding his wings to the edges of the room.  He beheld the priest again with his burning green eyes, he hissing laughter filling Loral's mind.</p>

    <p>"Ganthalrom"</p>

    <p>The word of command activated the black gem. The shine from Loral's earrings and rings faded.  Two magical gems that lit the room darkened immediately but the four torches of the room stayed lit.  The demon felt the shell of invisible protection surrounding his huge frame disappear. He called upon a column of lava to incinerate the priest but no fire came. All of his magical powers were gone along with all other magic in the room.  All magic within one hundred feet of the black gem ceased to exist.</p>

    <p>It mattered little to Xuzl. Even without his powerful magic, the demon was stronger than a the Ice Giants of Permafrost. He could crush all five of these pitiful creatures with a single stone. That was when he noticed the ballistae.</p>

    <p>"Fire"</p>

    <p>Two huge bolts, each a six foot steel rod tipped with a black barbed tip, tore through Xuzl's arms. The huge chains, attached to the end of the bolts, raced up the ground and criss crossed Xuzl's massive chest. Xuzl roared and the guardians felt their knees grow week. One of the elves manning the ballistae fell to the ground, his hands covering his head.</p>

    <p>The two barbarians bashed out two logs that held the stone wheels in place with their hammers. Behind the wall, a four ton stone weight fell. A network of levers and pulleys behind the wall pulled the chains tight around the beast. Four huge chains wrapped the demon around the chest, crushing the bones of the beast's wings.  Three more wrapped around its legs.  Xuzl was pinned to the wall, the chains held tight by the huge stone weight.  The strength of twenty frost giants could not break their bond.</p>

    <p>Loral had spent years studying the powers of extraplanar creatures and in almost all cases they had three powerful weapons; physical strength, magical abilities, and psionics . Two of the demon's three weapons had been removed.  Only one remained.</p>

    <p>While magical energies were drawn from the outer planes or their gods, even from one plane to another, the psychic abilities of outer planar demons came from a different source.  Unlike magical energy which would be stopped by the black gem, psychic energy worked on the internal powers of the mind and would be unaffected. Sometimes these psychic effects were subtle. Xuzl's was not.</p>

    <p>The elf that manned the left ballistae screamed, a scream so violent that his throat ripped itself apart from the strain. Blood flowed from his eyes and ears, running rivers down his cheeks. Loral felt his stomach heave when he heard a small pop and the elf fell dead to the stone floor, his brain crushed under the might of Xuzl's powers.</p>

    <p>The barbarian to the beast's left took out a large black shining helm he had hanging on his back. The helm cost almost as much as the black gem, its shape forged from instructions over five thousand years old. It was built from a material known to block the mental intrusions of the Shissar and was used as armor by the ogres of Old Norrath. The ogres used the armor to keep psychic intrusion out, but this helm was designed to keep it in. Most importantly, the power of the helm to block psychic abilities was not magical but natural.  It would work within the stones antimagic shell.</p>

<p>The ogre put the helm over Xuzl's huge head, the form fitting perfectly around the demon's black horns and covered the green burning eyes of the demon with smooth black metal. A latch clamped the helm shut, tight against the creature's head.  Loral let out a sigh of relief.  Had the helm not fit, they would have all died as their elven companion had.</p>

    <p>Xuzl felt his senses crash down. He could no longer hear the thoughts and emotions of the attackers. He could not send out his psychic tendrils into their minds. He could not summon his powers to call forth waves of lava or reopen a gateway back to his home world.  He could not even see.  For the first time in fifty thousand years of life, the arch-demon Xuzl was afraid.</p>

    <p>Loral watched the chest muscles of the huge beast flex against the strain of the giant chains. He saw the black claw clench into a fist and extend as if reach for something, anything. The chains pinned the creature completely to the wall, his arms wrapped around him in some obscene embrace.  Xuzl's roar got softer and softer, turning into an inhuman whimper as the chains tightened around his chest. Loral could not see Xuzl's eyes under the black helm, but the whimper was one that brought no hatred into Loral's mind.</p>

    <p>For the first time since contemplating the trapping of this unholy beast, Loral had doubt. He would have thought this feeling was one of Xuzl's psychic tricks, but with the black helm in place he knew such a trick was impossible. Who was he to trap so mighty a creature? He had orchestrated and carried out a plan to trap this beast forever within this tomb. What right did he have to do so?</p>

    <p>Another vision filled Loral's head. One of the beast Xuzl plucking an armored female elf off of a hill far away in the lands of Tunaria. The beast flew high, crushing the screaming paladin in an immortally strong grip. With a smile and a chuckle, the demon bit off her screaming head and swallowed it whole.</p>

    <p>Loral's vision snapped back to the trapped beast, faceless under the black helm. To remove such a creature from the world of Norrath was necessary. To have such a power free in the mortal world or even the planes was against all that was good.</p>

    <p>Loral and his remaining companions left the chamber, sealing the door behind them. After a few hours, the torches burned themselves out and the room was black.  The only sound was the forced breathing of the demon, his chest too constrict to scream or even speak.</p>

    <p>Loral walked past the illusionary treasure room filled with a king's ransom in platinum and magical items. Two stone guardians, built and enchanted by gnomish arch-mages stood motionless, protecting the room from intrusion forever. Should any adventurers get this far, an almost impossible feat, they would think the treasure room to be the final victory.  None would suspect the giant rock on the opposite wall to contain the unholy beast Xuzl, and his eternal tomb.</p>

<p>Thoughts of the demon flowed out of Loral as the thick liquid of the potion of forgetfulness flowed down his throat. In moments, he and his three remaining companions would forget the entire experience. It was the only way to ensure their secret remained so. All three stepped out of the maze-like catacombs and into the inner chambers of the Church of Tunare. Soon all three were walking through the streets of Felwithe, the encounter and its location already forgotten.</p>

    <p>None of them remembered that a few hundred feet below the streets of the elven city of Felwithe, chained to the wall and bathed in pitch blackness, hissed the eternal breath of Xuzl the demon. The demon, however, would never forget.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">1028@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p><em>For six years I have served the Emerald Guardians.  I was proud to wear their leaf on my cloak and eager to serve the people who had felt such torment at the fall of Takish Hiz.  It was a joy to travel to the far reaches of Tunaria as an agent of the Guardians.  It may now be my greatest pain.</em></p>

<p><em>Scores of orcs have fallen to my arrows.  The goblin witch, Tesht’uzu, spit out her last curse when my blade crossed her throat.  I traveled to Diren's Hold and defeated the great bear, Trapmaw.  But then my duties changed.  I was sent west to find a Tier'Dal Enchanter and his prisoner, an elven maiden whose mind had been broken with his poisoned words.  I found them at an inn in Highbourne.  The Tier'Dal's wicked magics ceased when I cut off his hands and then his head.  A stab of my guardian's blade ended the screams of the mind-warped elven maiden.  It wasn't until her hand reached out to her dead lover that the truth reached me.  Charmed vessels do not cry over fallen masters.</em></p>

<p><em>Troubled, I followed new instructions to head south through the desert of Ro to recover an artifact of the church of Tunare stolen by a fallen priestess.  It took me weeks to find her, deep in the swamps of Guk on a ruined pyramid of an old, dark god.  She was in prayer to whatever dark god she now served when my first arrow tore into her side.  A wolf-shaped demon attacked me from the shadows.  The elven enchantments of my blades ripped into its ghostly form and it burst into smoke.  Tesarin Moonstrider clutched the chalice to her breast, her prayers never ceasing, even when I plunged my thin scimitar through her chest to the hilt.  It was difficult to understand the prayers she whispered as life left her.  One thing rang clear.  They were prayers to Tunare.</em></p>

<p><em>For six years I have been an agent of the Fayspires.  Through bureaucratic double-talk and false patriotism they have turned me into a weapon.  I believed I was a ranger of Tunaria, serving the will of the Mother.  Tunare has left Tunaria and left behind the salted earth of a once-great elven empire.  Ranger is not the right word for what I am.  The world is not black and white.  I am Tarlin the Grey.</em></p>
<p><em>I am an assassin.</em></p>
<p>- From the journals of Tarlin of Tunaria</p>

<p>Loral pushed the worn leather journal across the table, knocking over his glass and spilling his red wine on the table.  The words hit him like a hammer.  It shattered a fog that had surrounded him since the days he left for Kunark.  Their missions had never been to rescue the elf maiden, Fironia Vie, but to fill the treasure-rich lands of Kunark with those who served their interests.  It had all been a lie.</p>

<p>For decades Loral had followed the church's orders, traveling throughout Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and now the outer planes.  Their motives or goals were never clear.  Loral had never asked for justification. He was trained to follow the will of the church.  Now images of his past flashed into his mind as the words of his father, written five hundred years earlier, rang in his ears.  The death of the Overking Bathezid, the death of Venril Sather himself, the vampyre Xalgoz, General V'Ghera, Trakanon, Nagafen, Lady Vox, King Tormax, Innoruuk, Cazic Thule, Terris Thule, Bertoxxulous, Rallos Zek and his sons, all of them had been slain with Loral's assistance.  Hundreds had been slain to further the goals of the council of Felwithe, expanding their lands, their influence, and their coffers.</p>

<p>Loral had been their weapon.</p>

<p>He left the city of Tanaan at once and traveled to Felwithe with only one thought in his mind.  He must face Yeolarn.</p>

<p>The stone door slid open, splashing the room with harsh light.  Loral walked in, silouetted black against the white light of day behind him.  His explosive entrance sent the guards' hands to the hilts of their blades.  They softened when they recognized Loral, not because they no longer thought he was a threat, but because there was little they could do about it if he was.</p>

<p>Allia Moondancer smiled when she recognized Loral under the hood of his cloak but the smile dropped when she saw the fury in his blue eyes.  As unthinkable as it was, Allia saw the truth of this visit.  If this conversation did not go well, elven blood would spill in the church of Tunare.</p>

<p>"How long have I been an assassin of the church, Yeolarn?"  Loral roared.  "How long have you built me into the dagger of Felwithe?  How long did it take you to decide to feed me to the Shissar?  How surprised were you when I returned?"</p>

<p>Loral stopped dangerously close to the platform where Yeolarn stood.  The Tunarian priests had the words of their battlemagic on their lips, but few had great expectations for their success.  They foresaw their magics flowing off of Loral's enchanted armor like water.  They saw his ethereal hammer swing out impossibly fast, crushing the steel helmets of the guards along with the skulls inside.  They saw his magic, a chaotic magic fueled by a demon some had whispered, rip through them like thousands of blades.  All of the priests stood tense and ready.  All but Yeolarn, who leaned heavily on his staff as if Loral's questions added weight to his shoulders.</p>

<p>"We sent you to Ssraeshza because we could not send an army.  We sent you because you ARE an army.  How long have we battled Crushbone?  How long have we kept the orcs in check when you alone could kill every orc in Crushbone in two hours?  We do not send you to Crushbone because the orcs are necessary for the stability of Felwithe.  You are an agent of the church.  We send you to the far reaches of the land.  We send you into the pits of hell and we send you alone."</p>

<p>The scarred shield burned on Loral's arm.  Deep in his mind he heard the whispers of Xuzl.  <em>THEY HAVE BETRAYED YOU, ELF, AS THEY DID YOUR FATHER.  RAISE YOUR HAND AND SHOW THEM WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.  GIVE THEM THE JUSTICE THEY DESERVE.</em>.</p>

<p>"Felwithe is no single entity, it has no single mind," Yeolarn continued.  "The motivations of each council member is as different as we are from the Tier'Dal.  Some sent you to Luclin to see if Felwithe was in danger.  Others sent you to die.  We have many agents in the lands, each acting independently.  Some are killed.  Some break under the strain and turn against the Mother herself.  But you return.  You always have."</p>

<p>Loral felt his skin set fire from within.  <em>RELEASE ME.  RELEASE ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU VENGEANCE.  YOU CAN WALK AWAY WHILE THE CORRUPTION OF FELWITHE BURNS BEHIND YOU.  DESTROY THIS CITY THAT SO INSULTS THE NATURE OF TUNARE.</em>  Loral clenched his fists Yeolarn continued.</p>

<p>"Fironia Vie's name was a banner for our interests in Kunark.  Venril Sather needed to die, whether a threat to Felwithe or not.  Emperor Ssraeshza needed to die, whether he would have left his temple or not.  We send you because there is evil that must be destroyed.  It is not about the safety of Felwithe, it is about good and evil.  It is about the will of Tunare."</p>

<p>Loral's head swam.  Behind his eyes Xuzl screamed for release.  Visions filled Lorals mind of Xuzl exploding from the church and burning all of Felwithe in a great ball of fire.</p>

<p>"You knew the truth before you walked in that door.  You act in the interests of Tunare, in the interests of good.  You have done so before and you will do so again."</p>

<p>Yeolarn handed Loral a scroll sealed in wax.</p>

<p>"Takish Hiz has been found."</p>

<p>Silence filled Loral's mind as both he and the demon within his cursed shield considered this news.  Then the voice of Xuzl screamed again in a tongue thousands of years older than the elves.  Loral silenced him with a single thought, a single promise.</p>

<p>He would release Xuzl in Felwithe.</p>

<p>From the worn leather-bound journal of Loral Ciriclight buried on a shelf of infinite books in New Tanaan</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/torment_landscape.jpg"><img src="./images/torment_landscape_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Plane of Torment" /></a>
    </div>

<p>It was 3168 in the Age of Turmoil.  Only a few months earlier we found that all of Norrath's lands had been folded closer, connected to they planar city of New Tanaan in the Plane of Knowledge.  I remember how strange and wonderful it was traveling a short twelve steps between Felwithe and Halas, a trip that took six weeks by foot and boat.  Now these portals have entrenched themselves into every aspect of our society, changing a thousand years of culture and economics by the removal of geographical boundaries.  How quickly we have accepted these planar gateways and now treat them as a dirt path through the woods or an oak wheel on a cart.  They are commonplace to us now and few of us can ever recall the world without them.</p>

<p>Now powerful adventurers have entered the Plane of Time.  What changes will we find as hunters and treasure seekers begin tugging on the strings that tie together our past and future?  The swing of an enchanted blade may sever the chain our very existence or release horrors beyond imagination.  How can we possibly understand the ramifications of our actions?  The life of a quarter of a million Erudites could be snuffed out like the flame of a candle.</p>

<p>Why do we go?  I find myself asking this question often.  Is it the will of Tunare?  In the great balance of the outer planes, her realm and the hells of nightmare and disease cannot threaten each other.  Is it the will of the church and the safety of Felwithe?  I doubt the demons of these deep planes could comprehend such an intrusion.  We cannot be sure the demonkind could survive in our world at all.  The pollen of a flower may be as toxic to them as Trakanon's breath is to us.  Is it the thrill of adventure that pushes us to these outer worlds?  After seeing the darkness within some of these terrible places, one must question the sanity of such a motivation.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/torment_building.jpg"><img src="./images/torment_building_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Plane of Torment" /></a>
    </div>

<p>Few questions in life have simple answers.  Many variables drive our actions.  I cannot say why my friends and I entered the Plane of Torment but whatever the reasons, there we were.</p>

<p>I had seen the world of the banished in a vision some months previous, but I was unprepared for the feeling of sheer hopelessness as we beheld the horrible world.  There are very real dangers in this prison world but it is the mental terror that is the most dangerous.  Were it not for my stout friends, Stonehewer, Semidil, Kabbal, Juror, Vuldar, and Norque, I would have fled as soon as my eyes beheld the blood red sky and black sea.</p>

<p>The air in torment was thick and hot.  Though breathable, our bodies revolted with each forced breath, rejecting the smell and taste of blood and decay.  Faint screams, moans, and unsettling laughter rolled across the black water.  The cells of Torment, rooms suspended from chains that led up into the red haze of the infinite sky, held beasts older than Norrath.  Demons who spend their days within their own insanity, hating all life itself and wishing for the destruction of all life including their own.  With trepidation our party took our first steps onto the first of hundreds of suspended walkways.</p>

<p>The deafening scream of the bloodravens was our first welcome to this hell.  The psychic attack drowned out any ability to call upon our magical powers.  The beasts flew on oily black wings.  They stared at us with bloody eye-less sockets and filled our minds with visions of endless terror.  They ripped into our skin with a power and ferocity far beyond their size.  While our magical powers were limited, the blades of Stonehewer, Kabbal, and Semidil quickly cut down the demonic birds, their screaming fading along with whatever life force they had.</p>

<p>Within the mental screams of the eyeless bloodravens I heard the laughter of Xuzl.  The demonic entity trapped in my shield showed me just how unprepared we mortals were to even think we could understand what we were seeing.  The demon projected his feelings of elation woven into the thicker fabric of horror.  Even with his tauntings, his protections saved my life.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/torment_demon.jpg"><img src="./images/torment_demon_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The battle of the Kaniz Hunter" /></a>
    </div>
		
<p>The Kaniz Hunter and Boruk Ravager made up for their lack of subtlety with pure physical power.  Like most creatures of the outer planes, their crude language was intermixed with telepathic visions of their intent to rip off our limbs and feast on our blood.  To feel the pleasure these unholy beasts felt at the thought or our own torture is a mental paradox beyond what mortal minds should face.  To see ones self as so alien a being is terrible indeed.</p>

<p>Thank Tunare that their physical forms were natural enough for blades and spells to combat.  Kabbal's great axe cut into the hoof of one, breaking the bone at an odd angle above its twisted backwards knee.  Far from defeated, the beast sunk its claws deep into Kabbal's thigh ripping into flesh and muscle.  My own prayers to Tunare sealed the mortal wound and Stonehewer's blazing greatsword beheaded the demon.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/torment_pig_demon.jpg"><img src="./images/torment_pig_demon_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="kabbal versus the Boruk Ravager" /></a>
    </div>

<p>With the finest elven swordsmanship, Semidil plunged his blades into the second demon's chest to the hilt.  Semidil stared at the blazing red eyes of the demon, expecting the massive creature to fall over dead.  The Boruk Ravager laughed and punched the warrior in the face, sending him skidding across the stone walkway.  A barrage of magic assaulted the creature, waves of poisons, disease, and clouds of darkness engulfed it as both Juror and Norque chanted.  The red eyes went white as blindness took over the demon.  Stonehewer promptly beheaded the second beast, seeming to prefer this method of dispatching the demons of Torment.</p>

<p>We traveled for four days along the suspended walkways of the prison world.  Succumbing to curiosity, I ventured close to one of these buildings and what I saw made me wish I had not.  I do not know how demons come to exist, whether simply created by their god or perhaps the manifestation of imperfections in our own world.  I do know that no natural force could have created the Constructs.  The beast was a mass of pulsating veiny flesh.  It dragged its weight with a number of swollen tentacles, each ending in a mouth lined with needle-like teeth.  It had no visible eyes, but three of the larger tentacles turned my way and I heard a gurgling hiss.  With uncanny speed for such an unwieldy beast the hideous creation attacked and it wasn't alone.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/torment_constructs.jpg"><img src="./images/torment_constructs_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Constructs" /></a>
    </div>

<p>Kabbal severed three of the hideous mouthed tentacles from the beast with a swing of his axe.  Daninulaer, my summoned hammer, smashed in the skull of another wolf-headed demon.  A third, seeing it was out numbered, grabbed Semidil by his chain tunic and in a flash of black light, the two disappeared.  Two more demons roared in and with the tentacle Construct still quite alive, our luck had run out.</p>

<p>Our astral lines snapped tight as the claws ripped into us.  The lines dragged our spiritual projections back into the Plane of Tranquility.  There was a moment of panic until we saw Semidil unconscious next to us.  Mentally exhausted but safe, we ended our exploration into Torment the only way we could have, defeated. Other adventurers had been trapped, doomed to an eternity of pain and misery. We did return, however, with a tale to tell and a little smarter for the experience.</p>

<p>Two years ago the Shissar gave me the greatest gift I had ever been given and then ripped it out of my mind like a barbed arrow.  For two days they injected sixty years of a life I had never lived into me.  I fell in love with and married a woman who has never existed.  Sometimes in that place between sleep and consciousness I can still feel her next to me, her hand draped across my chest.  Then I awaken further and remember that she was nothing but a dark electricity burned into my mind and I weep.  Sometimes I hear my son's laugh in the streets of the bazaar and I turn with a smile before my mind reminds me that he was never born.  For two years I have had to struggle with the acceptance that none of it was real.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if I have left the ancient laboratories of the Shissar warlocks at all.  I wonder if I am still living my own life or living the sixty year lie they wrapped around me.  One thing convinces me that the life I live now is real; I never questioned the one the Shissar fed to me.  I enter the Planes for a few reasons, but there is one strong one I do not wish to admit.  I go to the Planes because it is the only place that feels real.  The surrealism of the outer planes wraps around me like the embrace of a mother and for just a moment I remember the feel of Elandra's hand in mine.  That is usually just before the demons come.</p>

    <p>The room was small, no more than twelve feet across, with a desk, a rug, and a bed. On a chair opposite the door was the artifact, covered with a black cloth. Loral's eyes never left the object as he closed and bolted the door. Loral couldn't help but wonder if it was the last time he would ever see the outside world again.</p>
    <p>With a small knife, Loral carved runes of protection into the wood of the door and into the supporting beams. He used the dust of crushed peridots and globes of summoned water to make a shimmering paste that he filled into the carved runes. A prayer to his goddess and a wave of his hand made the runes shine with an internal light. Loral prayed again, this time surrounding his body with a magical shell of protection from both physical, mental, and elemental attacks. He did not know what he might face in this encounter, it was best to be prepared. With his protection spells in place, Loral was ready.</p>
    <p>Loral pulled back the cloth and revealed the circular shield. It appeared dull and scarred from thousands of battles. It was an artifact of the Plane of Fire, a shield that held magical powers beyond the understanding of mortals. It had been forged before the existence of man or elf, a weapon of power in a war long past. There was something deeper, however. During its last battle the shield had captured a piece of the spirit it once protected. Loral closed his eyes and began to speak.</p>
    <p>"Awaken, Xuzl." Loral felt a flash of heat as the shield came alive. Loral imagined the shield expanding into a gateway, its oily surface appearing as a black liquid. A red claw extended out. A blast of hot sulphuric air blew Loral's hair back. He could feel the beast enter the room, over two thousand pounds of muscled hatred and fire.</p>
    <p>Loral heard the thud of Xuzl's hoof hitting the wooden floor. He felt the mass of the beast all around him. The floor seemed to sink under the demon's weight. Loral heard leather wings unfold around him, filling the entire room. He could smell the beast's burning breath beating down on him. Through his closed eye lids he could see the burning green eyes of Solusek's guardian. In a basement of a bar in Felwithe Loral sat in front of one of the most dangerous creatures ever to step foot upon Norrath.</p>
    <p>Xuzl's voice boomed. "At last we speak, elf. I wondered when this moment would occur." Xuzl laughed, a sound mixed of screaming children and steel scratching on stone. Loral could feel Xuzl's mind probing into Loral's, seeking control.</p>
    <p>"Stand down, Xuzl." Loral spoke, putting as much strength into his voice as he could. "I know what you are and I have seen your powers before. You shall not have control over me." Loral held his hand up revealing the black oval scar on his palm - a scar it the shape of an eye. "I have been possessed before, demon. I have tasted the breath of evil from my own mouth and I shall not taste it again."</p>
    <p>Xuzl considered the scar for a moment. "A beast of Innoruuk gave you this," the demon spoke with a voice both deep and gratingly sharp. "The Prince of Hate never had much patience. Your resistance to me is no concern. In time, priest, you will feel the strength I can give to you and perhaps you will see things differently."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps I should toss you into the pits of Lavastorm."</p>
    <p>Xuzl laughed. "Perhaps some red-skinned goblin would find me there. Perhaps his mind would not be as strong as your own and perhaps I would be released faster than I thought." Loral felt his heart sink at the demon's logic.</p>
    <p>"I am a patient one, priest." Xuzl continued, "I have many powers to give and many tales to tell. I will not lie to you as Innoruuk's fiend did. It is far more entertaining to watch you burn by your own twisted truth."</p>
    <p>"And what truth is that?"</p>
    <p>"The truth that you do more to damage your world than you do to protect it. Do you think you've saved Norrath by killing Fennin Ro? Do you think no one will take the throne? Can you not see the great imbalance you have created? The Planes are a scale, pasty elf, and you just took all of the weight off of one side. It is only a matter of time before the world crumbles around you." Again came the steel-scraping laugh.</p>
    <p>"I have tasted the blood of your grandfather, elf." Xuzl's heat grew as he spoke. "I heard him scream out to a goddess that would not listen when I ripped him in half and crushed his skull in my teeth. A thousand of your kind I have killed, but your own self destruction may be the most entertaining death I have seen."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps, demon. But for now you will serve the will of Tunare. You will serve as my hand, as I serve as hers. And when your time of service is up, I will return you to your fiery pits with the other vermin that infest your world."</p>
    <p>Loral opened his eyes. The room felt no different than it had when he first entered. The demon was gone. The scarred shield sat quietly across from him. Loral picked it up and slipped it onto his arm, feeling its warmth.</p>
    <p>Loral considered the danger of such an item.  To have the voice of one so versed in the ways of the outer planes was a benefit beyond measure, even if the voice was so foul as Xuzl's. If the will of Tunare is served and the protection of the elves is sound, the methods may not be questioned. It would not be the first time Loral had fought next to the hand of darkness in order to serve the greater good and it would not be the last.</p>
    <p>Loral climbed up the steps of the bar's basement and into the city of Felwithe. The demon sat comfortably on his arm.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">155@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p><em>There are ways to try to wrap the mortal mind around the Planes of Power but all of them fail to grasp the entire picture.  Some view the Planes as a scale, with Norrath at the center and the planes spreading down to each end.  The further down one side you travel, the more extreme the Planes become.  On one side you have Innoruuk's domain, the Plane of Hate.  On the other is the realm of Tunare, the Plane of Growth.</em></p>

<p><em>Others see the Planes as a great sphere surrounding us. If we start at the center of this sphere, we see planes similar to our own world of Norrath.  The Plane of Knowledge and its stones of travel, for example, resemble many cities of Norrath.  This pocket-world, however, makes it possible to travel from Halas to Felwithe with fifteen foot steps.  It shortens the distances between two points in our world as if folding our lands to bring these two points together.  Yet the Plane of Knowledge is little different than our own, though it would seem to have encapsulated all of Norrath in a single walled city.  If we look at a further layer we begin to see extremes.  The Plane of Valor and its garrisons of immortal paladins sit on one side, forged in eternal battles against the chaotic beasts of the Glasslands.  The Plane of Torment and its eternal willingness to torture all inside for an eternity rots on the other.  One is unable to see where the black chains that hold up the eternal cells of Torment lead.  Perhaps there are no chains.</em></p>

<p><em>In the furthest of these layers known to us are the elements.  Their deities are beyond our comprehension of good or evil.  They serve our world at its most fundamental layers.  How would we choose to align water when it both feeds our crops with rain or destroys our cities in floods?  How do we choose to fit fire into our primitive beliefs when it keeps our children warm at night or sends armies screaming into the abyss?  And how can we possibly comprehend these worlds were we to visit them?  Is our mind able to even attach images onto what we might fix our eyes upon?  Do we stretch ourselves beyond our own boundaries of reality by even stepping foot inside?  We may never know.  One can only wonder what our mortal lives would face in such levels of extremity.  And one can only wonder what lies beyond.</em></p>

<p><em>- Maelin Starpyre, Grand Librarian of Myrist</em></p>

<p>The air cracked and the portal opened, sucking the hot air of Fire back through.  Loral fell, landing hard on one knee and a hand placed out to balance himself. His eyes were closed.  The air around him singed his skin but the heavy enchantments on his armor protected him from what otherwise would have burned his skin off his bones.  Slowly he looked up and opened his eyes to behold the outer world around him.  What he saw almost sent him into shock.</p>
    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/fire_wall.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_wall_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Wall of Doomfire" /></a>
    </div>
<p>Eternal flames scorched the sky.  The volcanic mountains towered around him, streams of lava pouring from their peaks.  Huge ancient trees burned like a thousand candles over the charred ground in front of him.  From within the dense burning forest he could see the movements of living flame and he could hear the clicking of many legs on the hard cracked ground.  There were enemies about and Loral had no doubt that should they discover him, they would kill him.</p>

<p>A hand gripped Loral's coif and hoisted him off of his feet.  Shaken, he turned and saw the smile and shining eyes of Tera the swordswoman of Halas.  Many battles he had faced with the powerful yet graceful bladewielder, some deep within the Halls of Testing, the ancient temple of the dragons of Velious.  The air cracked again and with a crash of steel on rock stood a monument of power, Grongl the Warlord.  He leaned on the sharp Blade of War and stood.  Three long but sure strides took him to the top of a large obsidian rock.  There he beheld the burning lands of Doomfire.  He sneered.  Loral had little doubt that the General was more at home in these horrid lands than anywhere on Norrath.  The powerful troll leaned the long curved blade on his shoulder and turned.  A cheer from the other members of Lotus Cult flowed across the lands as Grongl held the blade high and pointed it to the north.  From behind the crowd, Binedina and her advisors smiled.  The battle was on.</p>
    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/fire_guardian_golem.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_guardian_golem_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Golem of Fire" /></a>
    </div>
<p>The raiding party moved along the volcanic mountains around the burning forest and to a river of lava.  A great wall split the lands in half, guarded by dozens of Fennin's guardians.  Their burning spears glittered in the dark smoke.  The raiding party floated onto the upper platforms and in a score of fierce battles they breached the walls and approached the dark side of the burning lands, closer to the city of Fennin Ro.</p>

<p>The party met the minions of Fennin Ro in force.  Huge elemental flames, hundreds of times stronger than those that walked Norrath, unleashed waves of lava over the warriors.  All about the skies were great winged demons, the fire reflecting off of their thick red skin.  Some were as large as the guardian, Xuzl.  Some were even larger.</p>
    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/fire_spider.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_spider_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Babnoxis" /></a>
    </div>
<p>The horrible sounds of Doomfire grew quiet as they approached a narrow bridge suspended over a chasm of lava.  Six scouts moved forward, their eyes peering into the smoke ahead.  Without warning, a twelve foot spike, pierced through the chest of their leader, pinning him to the ground.  Out of the smoke came an vision out of Loral's deepest nightmares, Babnoxis the Spider Queen.  Over thirty feet high and almost ninety feet across from her massive legs, the giant spider roared down upon the party.  Arrows skimmed across her thick black shell <!-- candy -->and the spider countered with streams of venom from shining fangs.  A dreadful scream filled the heads of the raiders, the ancient voice of the spider queen, spewing forth malice and terror in a language five thousand years dead.  Loral felt a rage build inside him.  He held his hand towards the black demon-queen and called upon Tunare's Condemnation.</p>

<p>The roar of Xuzl filled Loral's head as energy poured out of his hand and blasted into the thick shell.  The shell cracked and Babnoxis screamed in Loral's mind, bringing him to his knees.  Loral heard the laugh of Xuzl behind the scream of Babnoxis, the shield burning upon Loral's arm.  Loral clenched his jaw and stood to behold the battle.  The enchanted blades of the Cult, forged in the outer planes themselves, cut deep into the joints of Babnoxis's living armor. With a final cry to her lord, the ancient beast fell dead.</p>
    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/fire_demon.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_demon_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Guardian of the Ring of Fire" /></a>
    </div>
<p>A voice boomed out across the burning lands and the council of flame was unleashed.  The greatest of Fennin's creation, the inner circle of Fennin's most powerful and loyal demons, roared to life and fell in from the burning sky.  Falling back to a narrow bridge, the war party faced each of the demons in turn.  Azobian the Darklord, Blazzax the Omnifiend, Hebabbilys the Ragelord, Javonn the Overlord, Reaxnous the Chaoslord, and Omni Magus Crato attacked the party one by one in two horrible hours of battle.  Columns of flame could be seen for miles.  The thick obsidian ground broke apart swallowing and crushing those unfortunate enough to step near.  Loral clutched his symbol of Tunare close, sending beams of healing light onto the fallen when he could.  All about him the battle raged.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/fire_fennin_chamber.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_fennin_chamber_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Chambers of Fennin Ro" /></a>
    </div>

<p>The war party never broke ranks.  Each member protected the next as the horrible beasts attacked.  The perfect synergy of magic power, enchanted steel, icy arrows, and blue waves of life was beyond the chaotic strategies of Fennin's high council.  With a final spear of ice ripping through the torso of the great Omni Magus, the final arch demon fell dead.  Deep in his chambers of burnt stone, Fennin Ro stood alone.  The war party approached.</p>

<p>Two weeks passed.  Loral sat at a great oak table in the library of Tanaan, reading over the memoirs of Maelin Starpyre.  Fennin Ro, elder god of Fire, had been killed.  While the rush of victory was hard to suppress, Loral could not help but feel a coming darkness.  He remembered the speakings of Ciric, his Erudite mentor, about balance and the complementary relationships of the gods.  How could the balance of Norrath be sound when such a great force had been slain?  As if in reply, Loral felt the shield leaning against his chair grow hot.  The grating laughter of Xuzl hissed in the back of Loral's mind.  Loral would return to Qeynos to speak with Ciric on these matters, but Loral had one more conversation to have first - a conversation with a demon.</p>

    <p>The final day of the elven city of Fayspires was approaching. The ancient trees of Telethin burned like giant torches, filling the sky with black smoke. Outside of the city, the armies of Tunaria battled the demons of Ro. Inside, the last sages of Fayspires concentrated their powers on the large blue shell that encompassed the city.</p>

    <p>Waves of fire and bolts of electricity bounced off of the protective shell. Then Rizlona entered the wizards guild and all was lost. Once known as a bard with songs that soothed the most troubled heart, the elven woman had been in seclusion for weeks before the gates of Fire had opened. For weeks Solusek Ro whispered to the bard, tempting her with powers and riches beyond any Rizlona had ever known. When she awoke this morning she found a white multi-faceted gem in the center of her floor. The last dark words of her dream rang in her ears. "Take the Dresolik to the wizards."</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/solro_rizlona.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_rizlona_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Rizlona the Traitor" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The eyes of the wizards snapped open when they felt the burning artifact enter their room.Before they could react, the gem flashed and a guardian of Fire appeared in the middle of the wizards' circle. The demon was black faced with red burning eyes and held a double-bladed glyphed axe.Elven magic exploded and blood sprayed on the white marble walls as the last defenses of Fayspires collapsed.</p>

    <p>Rizlona was given a place as a guardian of Solusek Ro in his black tower deep within the Plane of Fire. For five hundred years, her powers grew within her dark chamber. It was within that chamber that she now faced the vengeance of the elves. It was within that chamber that she faced the vengeance of the elves. She was reminded of the last days of Fayspires when she heard the roars of battle just outside her door.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/solro_grezou.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_grezou_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Grezou" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Few had ever seen a horror greater than that of the demon Grezou. Older than the mountains of Kunark, he attacked with a ferocity of pure hatred. Beams of energy shot from his emerald eyes and claws ripped through enchanted armor like paper. The blades of the warriors of the Cult cut deep but the beast was relentless. Calling upon the powers of his home plane of Fire, Grezou reached his arms high. His chanting was interrupted by a blast of absolute cold that tore through the massive chest of the greater demon. Loral turned to see an icy glimmer in Azile's eyes before they returned to normal. Loral shuddered.</p>

    <p>Covered in ash and soot, the raiding party entered Rizlona's chambers. Loral was shocked to see the elven woman armored in gold. His surprise intensified as his companions attacked the woman and she showed her true form.</p>

    <p>Solusek Ro had given many gifts to Rizlona for her part in the destruction of Fayspires. None was more powerful than her new body. Rizlona fell to her hands and knees. Her back arched and elongated. Claws sprang from her finger tips as she grew many times her size. Her armor fell away revealing a thick gold hide of scales. The cracking of bones refitting and reforming made Loral shiver. Huge batlike wings spread above the raiding force. When she raised her head again, Loral stared in shock at the head of a huge golden dragon.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/solro_rizlona_2.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_rizlona_2_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Rizlona Revealed" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Rizlona breathed and a huge column of lava engulfed the front lines of the raiders. Blue rings of protective magic kept the party alive if not unharmed. The party attacked. Powerfully enchanted blades and waves of magical powers ripped into the dragon. Though it felt as if it lasted for days, the battle lasted only a few minutes before the betrayer of Fayspires fell dead.</p>

    <p>Each of the five guardians of Solusek Ro had been defeated. A silence fell over the tower. Bubbling lava and creaking steal were the only sounds as the war party stood in front of the pillar of flame, the gateway to Solusek's antechamber.</p>

    <p>Solusek Ro stood on the raised platform of his throne room. His remaining minions stood with him, horribly powerful protectors feared by Norrath's eldest dragons.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/solro_throneroom.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_throneroom_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Throneroom of Solusek Ro" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Loral thought back to the stories of the exodus of Tunaria. He remembered the cold eyes of his father when Tarlin retold the sad tale. Thousands of elves had died, many of starvation and exposure to the harsh ocean of Tears. While the strongest of the elven armies died upon the fields of Northern Tunaria, many of the sick, the elderly, and the children of the elves died in travel to Faydwer. So weakened were the elves that they had been threatened with extinction at the hands of the Crushbone orcs.</p>

    <p>It was the jealousy and greed of this spoiled child of Fire that taught the elves the meaning of true sadness. The vengeance of Tunaria fed every elf who ever picked up a sword or cast a spell. On this day, vengeance was sated. Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince, was killed within his own lair. Across the Plane of Fire, one last flash of brilliant light from the top of the needle spire of his tower could be seen.</p>

    <p>Loral stood staring at the smoldering corpse of Ro. His hammer, Daninulaer, still hummed in his hand. An unintelligible voice whispered within his mind. The weight of his actions began to sink in. Rallos Zek the Warlord had been killed, protecting Growth from the assault of the frost giants of Kael Drakkal. Solusek Ro, destroyer of Tunaria, had been destroyed, avenging the death of thousands. All across the outer planes, gods, demigods, and their armies had been hunted and killed.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/solro_solusek.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_solusek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Burning Prince" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Somewhere within the chambers of Ro, a gnome of the raiding party found a lever opening a pit of burning lava. Darkweb the wizard recognized it as a gateway, perhaps deeper into the Plane of Fire.</p>

    <p>Loral stared into the burning pit. He could return to Felwithe this day. He could spend every day from now on in peace, knowing Felwithe was safe. Loral looked deeper into the gateway. There was no logical reason to continue. He had served Tunare more than any had ever expected. There was no need to face further unknown horrors. A single prayer and the powers of the Faithstone of Nature would return him home. Entering the gate would send him to dangers beyond any known by mortals. The laughter of Xuzl the demon echoed in the back of Loral's mind.</p>

    <p>Loral jumped into the pit of Fire.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It was three hundred and fifty years before the Age of Wonder and Tunaria burned.  Tarlin and his band of fifty rangers marched solemnly but quickly through Kithicor on their way north to Telethin.  They could already see the red smoke in the sky.  Fayspires was on fire.  They stepped out onto what was once rich and grassy lands but now was lifeless rock and ash.  It was on these burnt lands that the elves faced Solusek's demons.</p>

<p>They felt the ground rumble under their feet and the air filled with waves of heat as a massive form approached.  Grezou came upon them on twenty foot wings, his body rippling with muscles and smoking with an internal flame.  He opened his clawed hand and a cone of fire incinerated two of Tarlin's companions.  Holding their ground, the other rangers raised their bows and fired waves of arrows enchanted with ice.  Steam rose from a dozen wounds but the red demon was not finished.</p>

<p>Sixteen more companions were killed before the beast was sent back to the Plane of Fire.  While the troops regrouped and mended their horrible burns, Tarlin stood on a charred hill overlooking the valley that had once been Telethin.  He brushed away a dirty lock of blonde hair that stuck to the grime and sweat of his brow.  Large red shapes dotted the once lush countryside that was now a wasteland of ash.  Tarlin's heart sank. Two hundred more demons remained.  It was Takish Hiz all over again.</p>
  <div class="imageset1">

  </div>
<p>The Planes were alien to Loral in every way.  For a year he had traveled the planes and he felt himself changing mentally and physically.  His armor had shifted around him changing hue from deep blue to gold.  His summoned hammer, Daninulaer the Wraithsbane, pulsed with life in his hand.  Loral felt his grasp on the physical laws of nature slip the further he traveled into the Planes.  His time in the Tower of Solusek Ro was no exception.</p>

<p>Giant stone walkways stood suspended over huge chasms of lava.  Hallways forged from thousands of tons of iron twisted and turned throughout the demonic lair.  Teleportation crystals sent the Norrathian adventurers deeper into the tower, removing all sense of bearing and navigation.  There was nowhere to travel but up, further into the hands of the Burning Prince.  Loral caught a glimpse through a crack in the wall of the outside world.  He became dizzy when he saw the ocean of lava that surrounded the black tower for hundreds of miles.  His mind cleared when he heard the attack of the first of Solusek Ro's guardians.</p>
  <div class="imageset2">
    <a href="./images/solro_guardian.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_guardian_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The A Guardian of Ro" /></a>
  </div>
<p>The demon Xuzl sat within his black hall and waited. For six hundred years, he had remained within the giant iron tower of Solusek Ro, rising like a black needle in the center of the Plane of Fire.  After six hundred years, he remembered the taste of mortals. Although he would now face mortals again, it was not on their land.  It was on his own.</p>

<p>Xuzl stood to his full twenty four foot height and stretched his giant wings to the edges of his hall.  Outside he could hear his minions in battle.  The clash of steel and the blasts of flame flashed through his doorway.  Soon the intruders entered.  He recognized their races from his short stay on Norrath.  All the races were represented, it seemed, armed and armored with great treasures to fill his vaults and arm his own troops.  Xuzl was not a stupid creature, however.  He knew that no ordinary mortals could penetrate this deep into the 
tower of the elder god, Solusek Ro. He knew the strength of the guardians 
these adventurers had defeated.</p>
  <div class="imageset1">
    <a href="./images/solro_xuzl.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_xuzl_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Xuzl" /></a>
  </div>
<p>Two green eyes suspended in blackness were the first signs of this 
mighty foe the mortals glimpsed.  Then the room exploded into orange light as walls of fire roared to life.  Xuzl raised his claw into the air sending waves of fire through the war party.  Only the protective magics of their druids saved them from the searing heat.  Loral ducked behind his shield and felt the enchanted steel melt under the waves of flame.  The adventurers returned the attack firing dozens of enchanted arrows and magical spears of ice onto the beast.  Xuzl's own protective magics stopped many of the attacks, but some pierced his thick hide.</p>

<p>Any conversations among the minions of Solusek Ro's tower ceased when they heard the roar of Xuzl.  A demon among demons, none dared to challenge the creature. He was one of the five guardians of the Burning Prince himself and kept company only with those he commanded.  To hear the beast's cry of agony and rage put fear into the mightiest of Solusek's guardians.</p>
  <div class="imageset2">

<p>The smouldering corpse of Xuzl lay on the stone platform of his lair.  His mouth was twisted in agony and anger, bearing horrible fangs.  Loral eyes were fixed on the slain demon.  Many such creatures remained but for a party of mortals to enter the realm of Solusek himself and defeat such a foe was incredible.  Loral felt a twinge of doubt and trouble within the back of his mind.</p>

<p>Binedina stepped forward and handed Loral a round silver shield found in the demon's treasures.  Loral dropped his own ruined shield and slipped this new one onto his arm.  The roar of Xuzl's final death echoed within Loral's ears and the circular shield blazed with fire and then grew still.  A powerful item indeed, Loral thought, and bowed to thank Binedina for her generosity.  She smiled in return and the war party moved on.</p>

<p>Within the highest spire of the tower, at the tip of the spike within the world of lava, Solusek Ro stood.  There was a threat within his home.  His demonic sentinel had been killed. Solusek Ro summoned his remaining guardians close and ordered the remaining four sentinels to stand ready. Solusek, the Burning Prince, felt a sensation he hadn't felt for a thousand years - Fear.</p>

      <title>Make Everquest Look Better</title>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Everquest is a beautiful game.  Every frame, every view gives us thousands of bits of information, from what armor someone is wearing to how many nasty fire beetles are outside the gates of Qeynos.  Our view into Norrath is the primary sensory output of EQ.  Everything else our computer has ends up leading to the picture.  We need to make that picture look as good as it possibly can get.</p>

<p>  This article describes ten ways to make Everquest look better and give you a better gaming experience.  The following settings will dramatically improve the look of the game, however it is mainly for newer systems with over 512 megs of ram and either Geforce2 or Radeon video cards.</p>

<h2>Set initial Options</h2>

<p><strong>Who should do this:</strong>  Everyone.  Proper optional settings will make the game look better for everyone.</p>

<p>When clicking "Options" on the initial Everquest menu you will first be prompted to pick your video card.  Pick the one that matches your best video card, often the only selection.  The next menu is for detailed character models.  Choose as many as you can, ideally all of them on a system with 512 megs of ram or better.  The last menu is the Luclin Engine Settings menu.  Check "sound", "mip mapping", "Social Animations", "Dynamic Lighting" and "Texture Compression" to "on".  "Texture Caching" should be set to "off".  "Resolution" should be as high as you can go, 1280 by 1024 on 17" monitors and 1600x1200 on 19" and 21" monitors.  "Texture Quality" should be set to "high".</p>

<p>The detailed character models with Shadows of Luclin have greatly improved the realism of other players.  On a system with 512 megs of ram or higher you can set all models to the new ones including horses.  It is important that the use of high resolution models doesn't drop your frame rate to a crawl.  Frame rate is just as important as resolution for a realistic environment.</p>

<p>Properly setting these settings will dramatically improve the realism of Norrath from the detail of other players to the realism of the buildings and streets of the cities.</p>

<h2>Enable Mip Mapping</h2>

<p><strong>Who should do this:</strong>  Everyone with a 32 bit color video card including Nvidia Geforce or Radeon video cards.</p>

<p>Mip Mapping is a way to blur textures as they get farther away.  Having this enabled will mean that objects appear smoother as they get farther away.  If this is not working, you will see things shimmer as they get farther away.  This breaks the solid feel of the game and reminds us that we're just looking at a stupid monitor, not a world.  Mip mapping helps create a solid world.</p>

<p><strong>How to do this:</strong> The mip map setting under the initial "Options" set above is currently broken.  There is only one way to make sure mip mapping is working.  Open your "eqclient.ini" file in the everquest directory with Notepad.  Look for a line called "MipMapping=TRUE" and replace "TRUE" with "1" so the line reads "MipMapping=1" without the quotes.  Now restart Everquest.  Note:  Every time you change your display options you will have to redo this change in the eqclient.ini file.</p>

<h2>Set proper resolution, bit depth, and refresh rate settings</h2>

<p><strong>Who should do this:</strong>  Everyone.  While settings will vary depending on system, everyone should tune resolution to its optimal level.</p>

<p>Every pixel is telling you something.  Every dot on the screen is a bit of information.  The more bits of information you have, the more information your brain can process.  The higher the resolution, the more realistic the game is.  Bump your resolution to the highest possible resolution you can with your current monitor and video card setting.  On 19" and 21" monitors with high end systems, you should be playing at 1600 by 1200 resolution.  On 17" monitors you should be playing at 1280 by 1024.  Try different settings out until you can find the highest one.</p>

<p>Like resolution, the higher the refresh rate the better.  Set a refresh rate at 75Hz or higher when possible.  This will make your screen refresh faster which will reduce the amount of flicker.  While 60 frames a second is very fast, 75 is much better.</p>

<p>Bit depth is one of the smallest changes that will drastically improve your picture.  Setting a bit depth of 32 bit will remove saw-tooths at the bottom of buildings and remove a lot of strange effects at the bottom of rocks or statues.</p>

<p><strong>How to do this:</strong> There are two places to change this.  One is in the initial "Options" screen.  The other is in game with the Options menu.  Press "ALT-O" for options.  Press the "Display" tab.  Press "Video Modes".  Select the proper resolution for your monitor.  Select "75hz" refresh.  Select "32bit" bit depth.  Click "accept".  When your picture comes back, click "yes" to save those settings.  Should you pick a setting too high for your monitor, it will revert back to the original.</p>

<p>Icons and text will appear much smaller when you switch.  Use "/chatfontsize 5" to bump your chat text up.  The other windows will be smaller but you will get used to them in time.  Smaller user interface windows mean you get to see more of the world.  Remember that you are looking at a world, not a user interface.  Get the user interface out of the picture as much as possible.</p>

<h2>Clean your monitor</h2>

<p><strong>Who should do this:</strong>  Everyone.</p>

<p>A little Windex can go a long way.  Removing smudges and dust can give you a much nicer picture.  Remember that your monitor is your window into another world.  Keep the window clean.</p>

<h2>Calibrate your monitor</h2>

<p><strong>Who should do this:</strong>  Everyone.  Properly tuning a monitor costs no money and does not effect performance at all.</p>

<p>When a game artist designs textures they have their monitors set at something called "NTSC standard" a specific set of color, brightness, and contrast settings.  Your monitor should be calibrated as close as you can to NTSC standards.  Each monitor setting is different but you want your color to be set as close as possible to "normal". <a href="http://www.zonezero.com/calibration/english.html">This tutorial can help you calibrate your monitor.</a>.  If you have a monitor with professional settings, the color temperature should be set to 6500K.  Proper monitor calibration will make colors appear richer, deeper, less washed out, and more vibrant.</p>

<h2>Set anti-aliasing level</h2>

<p><strong>Who should do this:</strong>  Those systems running over 2ghz processors with over 512 megs of ram and either a Geforce 4 or Radeon 9700 video card.</p>

<p>Anti-aliasing is a feature of newer video cards but is often ignored.  With high-end systems, anti-aliasing can be set with little or no performance loss.  On most newer systems a level of 2x is appropriate.  With a very powerful system, 4x will improve it further.  Anti-aliasing will remove jagged lines  from objects up close and far away such as the edge of a sword or the brim of a helmet.  It gives a much sharper and more realistic picture.</p>
<p><strong>How to do this:</strong>  Different video cards will do this differently but most follow this basic instruction.  From your windows desktop right click on the background and click "display".  In the tabbed window click "settings" and then the "advanced" box.  From this advanced window click the "Direct 3D" tab.  This window should have some form of "anti-alias" setting.  Try either "none" or "2x" for most systems.  Very powerful systems can try "4x".  Framerates will vary.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Jalen had been guarding the gates of Felwithe longer than any human had lived. His blade had seen no fewer than five hundred orc necks in his two hundred years of service. He had been guarding the Koada'dal city since it had been founded.  As 
unexpected as it was, he died as he had always hoped, defending the 
city of the elves.</p>

    <p>The guardian of Felwithe never felt the ethereal blade cut through his steel armor and sink into his back. The Daiku Hendin, Gandulak, let the blade slip free as the body of the high elf fell to the ground. Gandulak's face betrayed no emotion as he looked with white pupil-less eyes towards the gates of Felwithe. The ogre pulled his cloak tighter around his large frame and faded back into the darkness. The assassin peered out from under the black hood, his tattooed face hardly visible. In a few hours, the king of Felwithe would be returning from Kelethin. Then Gandulak would strike. The king would be well guarded but none upon the mortal world had seen the skills of a Hendin, a master assassin of Zek. He had no doubt that he would be able to dispose of any guards who might stand in his way. He had no doubt that the king of Felwithe would die this day.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/drundor_war_wraith.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_war_wraith_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The War Wraith" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Loral's vision of the demonic assassin shattered as a War Wraith tore into the priest's party. The cowl on the beast's face made Loral wonder what horror was being hidden that could possibly be worse than the rest of the demon's body. Loral was shocked back into the present when a swing of Moegid's axe 
severed the beast's head from its body with machine-like precision. A shower of thick black blood sprayed against the wall as the corpse fell to the stone floor. The ring of the steel axe echoed down the corridors of Drundor.</p>

    <p>At the top of a large stone staircase, the war party engaged the Daiku 
Hendin Shadowmasters. Armed and armored in black metal forged from the 
mountains of the Plane of War, the Hendin attacked with the power of 
the giants of Kael who lived deep within Kael and also with the dexterity 
and accuracy of the finest elven swordmasters. Each swing led into three more, each feint led to a riposte that had their opponents clutching at their open bellies or slashed throats. Their white eyes burned with the thrill of combat but they never succumbed to the rage of a typical warrior.  Only with the solid coordination of powerful warriors and the combined efforts of many spellwielders were the powerful guardians destroyed.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/drundor_elite.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_elite_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Hendin Shadowmaster" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The adventurers were ragged when he struck.Some leaned heavily on their blades while others sat against the walls. A chill was felt throughout the party. An elven ranger narrowed his eyes and turned towards the dark hallway as a wind flowed past. A black blade burst through his chest. The blade pulled out and cut across, severing the ranger in half to the horror of his companions. Behind the cloud of blood was the grinning face of Vallon Zek, the master of assassins. A bombardment of arrows raced towards the god but before they landed, his visage split into five. Each acting independently, the shades of Vallon cut through the adventurers.</p>

    <p>Loral watched in horror as powerful warriors were carved into pieces before his healing light could keep them alive. In a well coordinated feint, the adventurers focused their attacks on each shade in turn while the others were led down the dark corridors by quickfooted druids. One by one the shades were cut down by the raiding party. Finally, with teeth clenched in vengeance, another ranger of Tunare fired two arrows into the eyes of the son of Zek. The god fell to his knees and then face down onto the stone floor.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/drundor_tallon_zek.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_tallon_zek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Tallon Zek" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>A great roar of anger rumbled through the fortress, numbing the bones of the adventurers and rattling their teeth. The mightiest warriors' knees went weak, hearing the immortal voice of war.</p>

    <p>From deep within the center of the fortress was the first arena ever created. A den of combat, only the best warriors had ever been tested there and few of these ever stepped out. The raiders floated down onto the sandy floor with spells of levitation. The stench of centuries of decay tainted the air and the roaring flame of Rallos Zek's axe lit the arena. The warriors of the Cult stepped 
forward - Dachunker, Grongl, Slivereyes, Torray, and Tera - all representatives 
of different cultures but all the mightiest warriors of Norrath.</p>

    <p>Bright red eyes of hate flared from within the black helm. His body was built from the blood of armies. His burning axe had been forged from the combined rage of one hundred thousand battles. Time slowed down for Loral as Zek's black boots cracked the stone under the sandy floor. With a huge throw, the burning axe soared. With a ring of steel on steel, the head of a human paladin tumbled through the air, a pinwheel of blood in its wake. Loral began chanting in time with six other clerics. A steady stream of healing energy filled the warriors, closing wounds that the horrible axe opened.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/drundor_rallos_zek.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_rallos_zek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Rallos Zek The Warlord" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Loral gained confidence as the battle raged on. While the black armor turned almost every attack, many hit home. The healing waves of Loral and the other clerics flowed, keeping the attacking warriors alive. The sizzling blasts of fire and ice pelted the God of War. The battle was in their favor, until the dead returned to life.</p>

    <p>Loral felt the ground under his feet break open. A rotting claw wrapped in a tarnished silver gauntlet reached out of the ground. All around the arena beasts tore free from the ground around them. Giant boars armored in gold burst through the rear lines of the war party. A score of the winged beasts they had battled earlier dove in, claws tearing into flesh. Quickly the creatures were rallied, taunted, and led astray by the arrows and spells of a rear guard. The slayer of Vallon Zek fired arrow after arrow, piercing the thick hide of a boar and tearing holes in the wings of the war wraiths.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/drundor_beasts_of_zek.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_beasts_of_zek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The beasts of Zek" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The burning axe spun in the air around the God of War. The blades of the warriors cut deep under his armor. Black blood flowed from a thousand wounds. The female troll, Dachunker, crushed Rallos Zek's knee with a skull headed heavily enchanted mace. He came down hard on one leg and the keen blade of Slivereyes's sword found the edge of a plate and plunged deep into the Warlord's skull. The fortress went silent. The risen beasts stopped their assault and turned towards their master. The impossible had happened. Slivereyes pulled his blade free from the helm and cut again at the God's neck almost severing the head from its shoulders. The red eyes flashed one last time and then went out. The burning axe, still spinning in the air, plunged into the ground 
with a crack of thunder.Rallos Zek the Warlord had been killed.</p>

    <p>Gandulak felt a psychic scream split his mind. Only his thousand years of training kept him from crying out. Something horribly wrong had happened. Twenty other Hendin, all poised outside of Norrath's cities, heard the same cry. Thousands of miles away the giant priests of Zek fell dead, blood streaming from their ears. Gandulak's skin grew cold. Something horrible had occurred within his home world. He drew a small ruby from within the folds of his cloak. He crushed the gem and blew the fragments into the air. A tear in the fabric of space created a doorway back to the Plane of War. Gandulak stepped into the rift and it snapped shut behind him. A minute later King Thearsis Thex came back from his meeting with the council of Kelethin, completely oblivious to the danger that had once stood only a few feet away.</p>

    <p>Loral awoke just before dawn in the inn of New Tanaan. The fragments of his dream slipped away as his eyes took in the room's furnishings. He pulled the thick blanket tighter around him and let his eyes close. The king of Felwithe was safe as were the other leaders of Norrath's people. Rallos Zek had been slain and his assassins had retreated. Loral could afford another hour of sleep.</p>

  <p>"The warriors of Zek are not finished with you. The fires of War are eternal. I shall return."</p>

  <p>The words from King Tormax echoed through Loral's head as he watched the frost giant lord die in the icy caverns of Kael Drakkal. For four years he had fought the giants of Kael. Loral had battled the frost giant general, Narandi, during the war of Thurgadin. He had destroyed the guardian of the church of Zek, Derakor the Vindicator. A hundred giants had fallen to Loral's companions. Still the spirit of war did not leave this powerful enemy. The Kromzek leader had fought a war on three fronts, battling Thurgadin, Skyshrine, and the Plane of Growth within the same year. Loral was no tactician but even his priestly mind knew how difficult such a campaign would be. All three enemies of the Kromzek continued to feel the sting of the giants' spears. Scores of Coldain were killed on the river banks of the Great Divide during Narandi's battle. Corpses of young dragons littered the Western Wastes, slain by the mercenaries of Kael. Loral had even found a spy deep within the inner halls of Skyshrine, cloaked and masked by the magic of the Kromzek priests.</p>

  <p>King Tormax lay dead but the sense of dread did not leave Loral. Outside stood the war machines of Kael aimed at the Plane of Growth. The war would be delayed but Loral doubted it had been stopped completely. The priests of Zek were powerful and the giant king would return to his dragon-skull throne. Only one path remained for Loral to follow. There was only one way to protect Tunare. He must remove Kael's resolve to fight. He must remove the source of their murderous spirit. He must face Rallos Zek.</p>

  <div class="imageset1">
    <a href="./images/drundor_tanaan.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_tanaan_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="New Tanaan" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>Ten years had passed since the battles of Kael. Loral sat at a small table in an inn of New Tanaan. Across from him sat a beautiful human female wrapped in red robes. Starkin the ranger walked into the bar and saw the venerable priest in his green robes speaking to her. She soon rose and walked out the door, smiling at Starkin as she left.</p>

  <p>"Who was the woman?" Starkin said as he sat down at Loral's table. "I do not recognize her."</p>

  <p>"Nor will you ever." Loral said with a smile. "I have met her perhaps a dozen times and each time she appears different. You could pass her again on your way out and not even know it."</p>

  <p>"One of the spies of your vast network?" Starkin said teasingly. "Certainly the church would not approve."</p>

  <p>"The Tier'Dal incorporate spies, my friend, I simply have contacts." Loral smiled and took a sip of wine from the crystal glass on his table. "Well informed contacts."</p>

  <p>His demeanor changed though when he remembered the tale of his friend, the enchantress. "The kingdom of Felwithe sent me here to locate threats to the elven nations," he spoke sternly. "The tools I use to fulfill that role are not of their concern. Perhaps the Church would not approve of my methods but they have not seen the dangers I have seen."</p>

  <p>Loral took two rolled parchments from his worn leather pouch. One held the wax seal of the Church of Tunare, the other the symbol of Healers United.</p>

  <div class="imageset2">
    <a href="./images/drundor_hall.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_hall_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Fortress of Drundor" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>"Zek has commissioned the construction of war machines from the gnomish tinkerers of Innovation. He already has an army of warriors and with these new machines he plans to invade Norrath. The model of the metal beast in Innovation was destroyed four days ago but I do not think that will dissuade Zek from his attack on our world. The priests of Kael will open a doorway to Drundor, the Fortress of Zek, and his army will march across Norrath."</p>

  <p>Starkin grew cold. He had seen one of his warriors, a Daiku it was called, in the desert of Storm. It took twelve adventurers to defeat the murderous beast. The creature appeared to be an ogre but with a speed, power, and sturdiness he had never seen in a mortal.</p>

  <p>"A portal has been opened to Drundor from the caves of Tranquility and a raiding party plans to infiltrate the fortress," Loral continued. "I plan on entering with them." Loral handed the two parchments to Starkin. "Please deliver the first to Yeolarn of the Church of Felwithe. The other should go to Juror." Loral rose and embraced his noble friend. "I will return with news soon." Starkin looked at Loral for the truth of that statement. Himself a veteran planewalker, Starkin the Warder knew that Drundor would offer little chance of escape.</p>

  <p>Two days later, Loral entered the Fortress of Zek.</p>

  <p>Norrath was a world of balance. Each element helped to off-set another. The outer planes had no such balance. Stepping foot into Drundor sent a feeling of murderous dread through Loral's skin. Rough stone floors fed into the metal plates of the walls. Steel torches burned harshly, blackening the walls around them. The clashing of steel upon steel, the howl of wild animals bred for war, the roars of triumph, and screams of pain all echoed throughout the halls. Though fifty members strong, the raiding party Loral accompanied felt small. There was no doubt in Loral's mind that he had entered a hall of death. There was no purpose for Drundor other than war.</p>

  <div class="imageset1">
    <a href="./images/drundor_guards.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_guards_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Guards of Drundor" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>Two guards of the fortress, over 20 feet high and armored in steel stained with dirt and blood, saw the approaching raiding party. Without hesitation or nervousness, they drew shining blades from their scabbards and roared as they swung at the front lines, hoping to sever them in half. Thus began the many battles the adventurers faced in the Fortress of Zek.</p>

  <p>All throughout the fortress, the party met the forces of Zek's army. Every guardian of Zek was covered in scars and each fought with the experiences of centuries of combat. Loral imagined the devastation that would face the cities of Norrath as hundreds of these icons of battle stormed through, mercilessly cutting down everything in their path. For these warriors there had never been peace. There was no concept of love or happiness. There was only the smell of blood and the rush of victory.</p>

  <div class="imageset2">
    <a href="./images/drundor_tallon_zek.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_tallon_zek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Tallon Zek" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>The party soon entered a large hall deep within the fortress. The torches burned low and Loral became aware that all had become quiet around them. A powerful warrior of the raiding party stepped in and drew his blade. From the quiet darkness soared a screaming arrow of flame. It struck the warrior and sent him flying through the air, slamming him against the back wall of the room. From the shadows stepped Tallon Zek, nocking another arrow into his ancient bow.</p>

  <p>The raiding party charged in to meet the demi-god. Tallon's 15 foot bow creaked and he let another arrow fly, this one blazing with ice. A mage caught the huge arrow in the chest and immediately fell dead, the four foot arrow still smoking in his chest. Steel rang against the god's armor as the party hacked at the diety of battle. Overwhelmed, Tallon spoke a word of command and fired another barbed arrow. The arrow split into three dozen smaller ones, each finding the mark of one of his attackers. Those hit by the barbed arrows flew back and were pinned to the walls of the hall. The shouts of battle became the cries of the dying as arrow after arrow left Tallon's unholy bow. But the attackers were filled with resolve.</p>

  <p>The healing energy of Tunare flowed from Loral's hands, mending the gaping holes of the evil arrows. Calling upon the strength of the Mother, Loral raised his hands and a shower of blue lights quietly embraced the raiding force. The light enveloped the adventurers near him, mending their wounds and renewing their spirit. The party regrouped and attacked again. This time Tallon Zek fell to their blades.</p>

  <div class="imageset1">
    <a href="./images/drundor_loral_hall.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_loral_hall_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral travels deeper into the halls of Drundor" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>Loral stood over the body of the son of Zek. Many of the party tended to the injured and to those fallen in the battle. Others sorted through the treasures found in the hall. Loral could only look at the corpse at his feet and wonder when this would end. The fortress around them continued to bustle with activity. Zek's army was far from defeated. Loral felt old. How far he had gone in the name of Felwithe. How many enemies had he uncovered. How distant he was from his home.</p>

  <p>Leaning heavily on his silver-headed hammer, Loral walked forward. His armor felt heavier than before, pressing deeply in permanent creases on his shoulders. The memories of Coldain blood staining the snow of Velious returned to him as he headed back into the depths of Drundor.</p>
