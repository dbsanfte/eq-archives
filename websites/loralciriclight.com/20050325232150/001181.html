      <h1>Mobhunter: The New Mobhunter</h1>

<p>Over the past few weeks the tinkering gnomes at Mobhunter installed and tested a new version of the site you so dearly love.  Give the <a href="http://mobhunter.com/new/">New Mobhunter Design</a> a look and try out the new comment system.  There were quite a few reasons for a change and the new version offers a few advantages over the previous version including the following:</p>

<p>- Both the homepage and each article should load faster.</p>

<p>- Both the homepage and each article has a simpler design suitable for printing and reading on smaller screens.</p>

<p>- Comments are now flat instead of threaded.  Read all new comments at once instead of clicking through the threads.</p>

<p>- The links on the homepage are now updated and easier to maintain.</p>

<p>- The site continues to have the same clean look you appreciate.</p>

<p>- Mobhunter now has both a <a href="http://mobhunter.com/new/index.xml">Really Simple Syndication 2.0</a> and <a href="http://mobhunter.com/new/atom.xml">ATOM</a> newsfeed for headline syndication.  For more information about news syndication, read <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/rss/">Yahoo's RSS page</a>.</p>

<p>- For you HTML Tech-heads, the site now supports XHTML 1.1, CSS 2.0, and W3C Accessibility guidelines for the disabled.</p>

<p>- The new version includes dynamic space-age knowledge scripts to add 24% more wacky pop-culture references.  You'll be wearing your pants backwards and singing "Jump, Jump" before you can spell "Chia-pet".</p>

<p>The comment system will take a little bit of getting used to and we may make changes for the articles that get over fifty comments.  Please give it a good test.  Assuming we get the kinks smoothed out, we will release the new version in a couple of weeks.</p>
