      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p> Last week's update gave us quite a few improvements. Both the LDON adventure-point trade-in and the safe augment removal system went in and both work quite well. At the last moment SOE changed the refund value to 70% from 50%. The 20% increase combats the problem of adventurers skipping mid-level gear and saving up for only high-end gear. The 300 and 750 point armor sets are much more desirable now that one can return them when one decides to upgrade. With the save augment removal one can move augments from older to newer sets of this armor.</p>

<p>The changes to Lost Dungeons go a long ways towards helping single-group hunters equip themselves for the harder content in Gates of Discord. While we will not receive new LDON equipment until after Omens of War, these changes bring new life to LDON.</p>

<p>The new tribute change improves the value of Gates of Discord for players under level 55. The ability to start and stop tributes gives players a bit more control over these chaotic and expensive effects. The tribute system is much improved over the original.</p>

<p>The ability for zoning pets made a lot of pet classes happy. Now the equipment and buffs one gives a pet last a lot longer. Now if only pet classes could name their pets. Identity is everything.</p>

<p>A new LDON raid on Stormhammer focused on two groups of level 55 to 65. Early reports from my Stormhammer spy network state that the raid is quite a bit harder than level 55 equating it more towards Elemental / Time level. LDON raids offer much unused potential. SOE could easily build Vox / Naggy type raid encounters for all levels and equipment power using the expeditions of Gates. They could focus on two, three, four, five, or six groups. They could bring raiding to everyone, not just the most powerful guilds, but instead they focus most raid content on Elemental / Time level guilds.</p>

<p>Currently LDON raids offer too little reward for their difficulty. Raiding guilds skip them because of low rewards and everyone else skips them because of their high difficulty. The easiest way to fix this problem is to lower the difficulty and lower the reset time of these events. They offer too much potential to let them rot.</p>

<p>The Veeshan's Peak revamp made it to live servers with the last update. A new quest parallel to the old one both lead to a new raid event in Skyfire mountains. Another hideous shade of the Dar challenges elemental level players and rewards them with access to the revamped elemental-level raiding and hunting zone. I would complain about another hunting zone blocked by raid-level encounters but there is a lot of unlocked single-group content at the elemental level in Gates now including Riwwi, Tipt, Vxed, and the sewer trials.</p>

<p>Though listed on the top ten items SOE would focus on after the guild summit, it appears we will not see solo instanced adventures at least until after Omens of War. Again, I would complain except that raid-focused requests such as the instancing of Time also face the same timeline. There is a simple explanation for the delay; it takes too much time for the amount of work solo instanced adventures require.</p>

<p>Some asked for SOE to reduce the number of required players from three to two or one but this doesn't solve one of the biggest problems with soloing, not everyone can solo and some solo far better than others. For some, soloing is more profitable than grouping. That is simply broken. Grouping should always offer a higher gain than soloing for all classes. Soloing should be desired only when time restricts a player too much to group.</p>

<p>Only two solutions solve this problem. Increase the ability for a class to solo where needed or focus content around each class so each class solos effectively. Both of these changes require extensive work both in development and in balancing. New solo abilities could unbalance a class in grouping and raiding creating another round of "my class is worse than your class" woes. New content requires a lot of development work for little gain. Building an entire zone, even if it's small, for a single class only reaches a fraction of its possible population.</p>

<p>The delay of instanced solo content puts a lot of weight on the shoulders of the new Omens of War task system. It may be too much weight to bear if Sony doesn't find other solutions.</p>

<p>The real problem comes down to limited content for people with limited time. People with only 30 minutes to play need something useful to do. If they're a wizard, they can go solo but if they're a warrior, life isn't as easy. Tradeskills and quests help but not enough. Adding new mini-games might help. Additional quests like the low level newbie quests but for middle and high level hunters might help as well. Everquest requires short duration content, in whatever form it decides to take.</p>

<p>Hobart's testing thread shows us the updates we'll see in future days. This includes new multi-slot augments for slot 7 and 8 augments; consenting options for groups, raids, and guilds; and a new system-friendly Everquest that lets you cap your framerate. My machine's whole purpose in life is to run Everquest so I see little reason to focus it but I suppose some people want to watch others rip their cars in half on Ebaums World while raiding Uqua.</p>

<p>In the last sixty days we've seen many excellent improvements for all players. While a lot of cynics, myself included, have accused SOE of focusing on raid-level content, they showed their level of support to all players regardless of level or play style. Gates shifted from an expansion for only a select few to offering up some excellent zones and encounters. Simple changes like the Gunthak stone, tribute activation, LDON point returns, and the excellent tutorial helps old and new players of every class and level. A bright future lays ahead.</p>

      <title>Mobhunter: The Advantages of Point-based Loot</title>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>This week's Mobhunter discusses the advantages of a point-based loot system.  While Everquest primarily uses random drops to reward players with equipment, Lost Dungeons of Norrath showed us a new, fair, and powerful loot system.  It is my hope that we see systems like this used more in the future.</p>

<p>Along with instanced dungeons and content scaled for all levels, the Lost Dungeons expansion brought us the adventure merchants.  This new method for acquiring treasure rewarded each member of a group with points they could spend on new items.  This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the adventure point system.</p>

<p>The adventure point system lets developers tune equipment directly against the effort required to acquire it.  A Breastplate of the Sands always takes 1492 adventure points.  At a minimum this takes 15 hard adventures at level 65 or 15 hours at a minimum to complete.  Most likely it takes 30 hours; 30 normal adventures at level 65.  Random loot, in comparison, may drop the top item the first time or the 500th time.  Even the developers do not know how often it will drop.  Developers control the odds of a dropped item but they do not directly control the drop rates.</p>

<p>Adventure point systems reward all participants in an event evenly.  Adventure point systems also offer clear progression towards equipment goals. Each adventurer wins and each adventurer knows how much closer they are to the item they desire after each adventure. </p>

<p>For years many high-end raiding guilds used a point-system for raid loot distribution called the Dragon Kill Point system.  This system, maintained by the leadership of the guild, awarded loot to the members of the guild who deserved it most based on attendance.  This works well for most guilds but works poorly for less organized groups.  Such systems face corruption or destruction when the leaders either move on or turn sour.  </p>

<p>While the DKP system works well for many high-end guilds, a game-based point system works for everyone.  Any player from any guild can earn points by attending encounters or adventures that award points.  They may hunt with a different group every day but every day they earn points.  For unguilded or lower-end guilds, such systems help players grow steadily towards their goals.  Point-based systems help facilitate pick up groups between players who do not know each other but may one day grow into great friends.  It rewards players without regard to their guild tag and does not require the sacrifice of a group for the progress of an individual.</p>

<p>There are some problems with an adventure point system.  The wide range of armor available on the same point systems in LDON rewards everyone with progress at the most powerful gear.  Because any player of level 20 can go to the Lost Dungeons, they begin earning points towards the high-end armor right away.  The only thing in the way of top-end gear is time.  Regardless of how easy LDON missions become, the points each player earns always lets that player buy new gear.</p>

<p>Dedicated adventure loot for specific content solves this problem.  The sewers in Gates of Discord have a set difficulty – Level 65 pre-elemental level.  The developers know how difficult the sewers are and tuned it for a specific group.  They also know that Elemental armor would benefit this group.  They do not want players gaining elemental loot every time they enter the dungeon so instead they make them rare drops.  The problem with rare drops is that even the developers don't know if this treasure drops the first time or the fiftieth.  The players are not progressing towards this gear, they hope for a good loot table roll and a good roll against the other players.  It can turn players against one another instead of supporting them all equally.</p>

<p>Instead, consider a sewer trial that rewards each player with one sewer point for each completion of a sewer expedition.  Our friend, Mordin Rasp, offers us Elemental-level loot for ten points each.  Do ten sewers, get a nice item.  For the Tipt / Vxed trials, offer a different set of loot on a different point system.  Loot is carefully controlled and is directly based on the difficulty of the encounter and the time one needs to spend in it.  The loot system cannot be corrupted by other players and everyone in the trial earns something for their effort.</p>

<p>Point-based loot should not replace random drops.  Developers design random loot to be a surprise to players, not something to be farmed over and over.  A mixture of point-based loot and random loot helps ensure players can gear up for new content but doesn't remove the excitement of getting a surprise item off of a hideous beast.</p>

<p>Point-based loot works well for progressive loot like the basic armor.  Chest, wrist, leg, feet, head, hands and arm equipment could come from point-based systems while rings, earrings, masks, and necklaces, may still come from lucky random drops.  Players work steadily towards progressive armor while still receiving random equipment for secondary slots.</p>

<p>The point based system of Lost Dungeons of Norrath was one of the great improvements of Everquest.  SOE has no plans to further capitalize on this system.  While it is not the solution to loot in Everquest, it offers many advantages in many situations over random drops and dice roll rewards.  It rewards groups of strangers as well as guilds.  It helps all players earn gear required for further progression.  Much in the same way a Player vs Environment system fosters cooperation, point-based loot systems rewards successful groups, not lucky individuals.</p>

<p>A patch due out next week offers a lot of good changes for players of all levels including safe augment removals, Lost Dungeon adventure point refunds for unused gear, changes to the tribute system, changes to the user interface, some new zones and zone revamps, and changes to pets.</p>

<p>For a price between 1 and 4000 platinum players can purchase solvents that remove augments from items without destroying them.  There are eighteen such solvents with prices that increase depending on the power of the augment.  Low-end augments cost one or two platinum; the 1500 point LDON augments cost 1000 platinum, and raid-level Gates of Discord augments cost around 4000 platinum.</p>

<p>Adventure merchants on test now buy back LDON purchased equipment at 50% of its original cost including the augments mentioned above.</p>

<p>While the changes above don't add more powerful items to the adventure merchants, it helps players replace and purchase more of the existing higher-end items.  The ability to trade in unused equipment allows players to purchase more of the current high-end armor and augments.</p>

<p>New Lost Dungeon raiding zones make their way to Stormhammer and the Live servers next week.  A 40 to 55 Lost Dungeon raid moves from Stormhammer to the regular servers while Stormhammer receives a 55 to 65 raid for sub-elemental equipped raiders.  These additions may help improve the use and perception of Lost Dungeon raids which did not meet the expectations of either lower-power or higher-power raiding groups.</p>

<p>The test server also includes an excellent change to the tribute system.  Players will soon activate tributes when needed with an “activate” button.  Players are immediately charged the point cost for whatever tributes they selected from their tribute master in their home town.  Activated tributes last ten minutes and can be reactivated when needed.  This change drastically improves the tribute system.</p>

<p>Pets for all pet classes will soon zone along with their master.  Like the current beastlord warders and the Wizard's Mr. Flappy Flap, pets for all pet classes will now travel across zones and last during short link-deaths.  This is a huge improvement for pet classes..</p>

<p>Some new changes to the interface include visible buff timers and a numeric mana pool display.  Players have asked to see an exact mana count for years and they will finally have it.  The buff duration timer, though available for 15 leadership points, helps people manage their buffs a lot easier.  Expect to see all new user interfaces with both of these features.</p>

<p>SOE will release a rebuild of Veeshan's Peaks, the first locked raiding zone in Everquest, next week.  Those with a key to the old Veeshan's Peaks have to perform one last piece of the quest to gain access to the new VP while those without the old key must go through a new quest to gain access.  The zone is tuned for Elemental-level raids.</p>

<p>I had more of an opportunity to hunt in the Gates of Discord over the past few weeks and I continue to find improvements since the recent Gates revamp.</p>

<p>A few nights ago I took a group between 60 and 65 into the explorers version of the Sewers.  Players can spawn two different versions of the sewer expeditions; one that does not lead to a flag for Kodtaz and one that does.  The non-flagging version seems a lot easier for a mid 60s group.  Though we saw no rare beasts and received no treasure beyond some platinum, the beasts did not hit nearly as hard as they once did.  We earned over 1% experience per kill, around the same experience as Valor, and did so in an instanced zone.</p>

<p>The last patch included changes to the spell drops in Gates.  Instead of dropping a class specific spell, a rune dropped that could be traded in by any spell casting class for their own class specific spell.  What wasn't mentioned is that the drop rates for these runes was decreased.  Some players report killing over one dozen named mobs and not receiving a single spell.  I know dozens of level 65s who spend a lot of time in Gates and still have not a single spell.  While SOE considers spells to be loot; not everyone should have them all; spells are one of the selling points of a new expansion and when we cannot even get one of them we don't feel like we're getting our money's worth.</p>

<p>Every expansion should have at least one or two spells for sale on top of higher-end spell drops.  Only ancient spells should be so exclusive.</p>

<p>I've had a lot of interesting comments and heated discussions with developers and players regarding equipment progression for single-group hunters.  With the refunds and safe augment removal changes to Lost Dungeons and the items available in Riwwi, Ferubi, Barindu, the sewers, Vxed, and Tipt, it may be possible for a single group to progress into Kodtaz and the Ikkinz trials without requiring elemental and time gear.  A few higher-end items in LDON would not unbalance the game and would help single-group hunters with limited time see more of what Gates has to offer.</p>

<p>Since the guild summit we've seen a lot of improvements to Everquest and next week's patch is no different.  Most of these changes help players of all levels and most classes.  Small improvements like the selective activation of the tribute system, the new user interface labels, the LDON safe augment removal and and point refunds, improve the game significantly.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>Loral sat in the heavy wood chair running a finger along the grain of the worn table. A gray vacancy filled his eyes; his mind was a lifetime away.</p>     

    <p>The cold northern breeze slid in the tavern's window, bringing strange smells to Loral's nostrils. It had been two years since Loral last visited Qeynos. Even the air was different.</p>

    <p>Black blood from horrors beyond the world of Norrath stained and tarnished Loral's golden armor. A string of leather tied back his grey hair. His dirty left hand circled an untouched goblet of wine, the black scar of his palm a deep contrast to his pale skin. On his back sat the burning shield of Fire, the phylactery of Xuzl. Loral felt the demon smile even now.</p>

    <p>A wave of the cold northern wind blew in as a dark-skinned figure cloaked and hooded in blue opened the door and entered the tavern. He stepped towards Loral's table on soft hide sandals. A small silver medallion cut in the shape of a crescent moon hung around his neck and three red dots sat below his left eye. His skin had wrinkled and he walked with a slight limp but otherwise he was the same priest Loral met decades ago in Felwithe.</p>

    <p>Ciric sat down at the table, his eyes fixed on the golden-armored elf.</p>

    <p>"Your father is alive. Death will not find him for many years." Loral let out a breath he hadn't realized he held in. Ciric continued, his voice even and calm. "He is severely underfed. His muscles are weakened. He cannot stand. His left eye is blind."</p>

    <p>Loral's eyes filled with tears. He couldn't imagine what his father faced in the depths of Hate and Torment. No mortal ever survived for so long in places like that.</p>

    <p>"He hasn't spoken. He doesn't yet seem to recognize this place." Ciric put his hand over Loral's wrist. "We are taking care of him, my friend. We will take care of him as long as we have to."</p>

    <p>"Now tell me how you found him."</p>

    <p>Loral looked up, light streaks of pale skin drawn from his eyes down to the side of his mouth.</p>

    <p>"Xuzl told me." Loral let the words hang in the air while he watched his mentor's reaction. These three words could have the priest excommunicated from the church if not executed as a heretic. If any one man understood the pain behind these words, it was Ciric. Loral reached into a pouch at his belt and drew out a small leather-bound book.</p>

    <p>"I found this in the library of Tanaan. It is my father's journal." Loral kept his hand over the small journal. "He began writing it when he joined the Emerald Guardians of Telethin over four hundred years ago.</p>

    <p>"It seemed my father had many of the same problems with his kingdom that I have with mine. Many were slain by his hand under the order of loyalty and valor. He quickly lost stomach for it.</p>

    <p>"During the wars of Telethin he drew his blades again. When the elves reached Faydwer he fought with the armies of Kelethin against the goblins and orcs that wished to send the elves back into the sea. His tale ended but I have more journals to discover.</p>

    <p>"Xuzl learned of my father as he invaded my dreams. He sent his agents of Fire far and wide to find anything he could use against me. He found much.</p>

    <p>"Over one hundred years ago a plane-walker broke into a church in the Plane of Hate and stole an artifact of the dark priests of Innoruuk. The rogue returned to Norrath with the artifact and hoped to sell it but the danger of the artifact grew in his mind and he sold it to my father for copper.</p>

    <p>"The dark priests called fourth a creature of Hate, filling a cauldron with their own lifeblood and once released, this agent of Rancor began hunting down this hammer.</p>

    <p>"Tall and covered in leathery blue skin, the agent of Hate hunted across the lands with burning red eyes under his black cloak and hood. He carried a long jagged shard of metal from another world. Leather from the skin of a wyrm wrapped its handle.</p>

    <p>"The cloaked agent strode past the guards of Felwithe like a cold shadow. My father never stood a chance.</p>

    <p>"My father found himself in the shadowed world of Hate, hearing whispers of paranoia that blew through the iron city like a chilled wind. The demonic hunter smiled over jagged pointed teeth when he saw the pain and fright in my father. The agent of Innoruuk plunged his long dagger into my father's heart.</p>

    <p>"Death is strange in the Planes. With so many ways to travel, death comes differently to all. For my father, death was exile. The hunter threw his broken body into a pile of others that rotted on every street corner of the dark city of Hate.</p>

    <p>"Some, when they face death, are judged by the even hand of the Tribunal. Some, however, find themselves lost in the chaos and horror of Saryn's cells in the Plane of Torment. There is no justice there, no judgment. There is only pain and misery. That is where Xuzl found my father.</p>

    <p>"Xuzl is old and his spy network is vast. There is little information he cannot find. He was surprised to find my father alive, deep in the cells of Torment. He was surprised and delighted.</p>

    <p>"Even the twisted horror-masters of Torment didn't know why my father was there. This didn't stop them from breaking him apart and rebuilding him every day for one hundred years. Xuzl's spies found him there, broken and drained of every ounce of life.</p>

    <p>"Xuzl saw the state my father was in and knew the pain it would cause me to see him that way. He also knew it was the only way he could get what he wanted."</p>

    <p>"What is that?" Ciric's voice sounded strange after Loral's description.</p>

    <p>"Release." Loral's eyes stayed on his drink. "He wants to be free upon Norrath again. He wants to feel the ground die under his feet. He wants the air to scream in protest against his very being." Loral looked up to his friend and mentor.</p>

    <p>"I accepted."</p>

      <title>Mobhunter: Progression in Everquest</title>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p> The short-winded summary:</p>

<p>These days, players have smooth equipment, experience, and zone progression from level 1 to 65 / 100ish AAs. At this point, equipment becomes the only way to progress and the only way to reach new zones. High-level raiders burn through content faster than anyone else, this is why expansions like Gates of Discord and Planes of Power exist. Characters from levels 1 to 64 require new features similar to the new tutorial, the PoK stones, the tribute system, the bazaar, and the LFG tool. Characters at level 65 need new levels, aas, and equipment and need to be able to reach these without raiding. Players at all levels need something meaningful to do in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The longer pontification:</p>

<p>In an interview on the success of Everquest, one of the original designers attributed this success to three things: dependency between classes, social interaction, and progression. Progression keeps us hunting, raiding, trading, and traveling. Without it, Everquest would be AOL Instant Messenger with graphics. With it, Norrath breathes and her people prosper.</p>

<p>Players progress in Everquest in three main areas: experience, loot, and zones. Everyone from levels 1 to 65 seek out these three almost infinite goals as they travel through Norrath. When one line of progression begins to slow down, we focus on the other two. If two lines slow, we go for the third. If the third slows, we become tired and weak and spend our days writing angry messages to Brenlo.</p>

<p>Levels are the most basic form of progression; offering the largest changes in power but also the largest difficulty in development time. SOE offset the difficulty in implementing level increases with Alternate Advance points. AAs are easier to design and implement, use the same experience method as levels, and don't threaten to unbalance the game. Equipment upgrades are the second most common way to progress in Everquest.</p>

<p>Most don't think about zones as a form of progression, but it is the only one that visibly changes as character levels increase. While gear and levels generally increase arbitrary numbers, zones look and act far differently from one another. One of the reasons we want to get to level 30 is to see Dawnshroud Peaks. One of the reaons we want to get to 45 is to see The Gray. 46 lets us enter the hideous planes of Disease, Nightmare, and (*shiver*) Fear. Each of these zones offers new hideous rats, bats, and spiders for us to destroy. Many of us dreamed of that firey doorway into Fear and dreamed of the day we could face Cazic's hellish minions. Today, many of us can reach that world (Tunare knows why we would want to), and now we dream of the furthest reaches of the Elemental Planes, the Plane of Time, or the lost temples of Taelosia.</p>

<p>Progression changed much over the last five years. New tools like the Knowledge portals, the bazaar, the tutorial, quest armor, and instanced dungeons change how players progress today from how we did so many years ago.</p>

<p>Characters progress in level, equipment, and zones steadily and continuously throughout most of the game. While the shift from soloing to grouping around level 30 becomes more difficult; sometimes it's all we can do to find a group; there is no lack of new items in the bazaar to purchase, new zones to hunt in, or new levels to gain.</p>

<p>From level 20 on, there are instanced dungeons in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath and even a new instanced expedition in Natimbi that allows most characters below 50 solo without interruption by other players. The instanced dungeons offer unlimited experience zones from level 20 to level 65; over-camped hunting zones are history. If you can get three people together, you can at least try a Lost Dungeon even if you aren't successful in the adventure.</p>

<p>Equipment progression is also smooth from level 1 to perhaps level 64. Nice items with restrictive level recommendations can be purchased for low prices, higher end items cost more but upgrades are usually for sale at reasonable prices. Players lower than 65 may want to camp a rare item or two, but they may better spend their time acquiring levels and save that equipment camping time for later. Occasionally one might get a nice dropped item and another may pay for something with adventure points in LDON, but the best value for the time spent comes from the bazaar below 60.</p>

<p>Characters of all levels now have the opportunity for constant experience progression at every level. Every level has zones full of dark-blue beasts that offer between 1% and 2% experience every battle. Alternate Advanced skills help off-set those who raced to 65 and it isn't until each class crosses over perhaps 100 to 150 AA points (each the equivalent of leveling from 50 to 51) that the diminishing returns of the skills outweigh the desire to acquire them. Who really wants to spend four hours so you don't eat food so quickly. Achieving level 65 with 150 AA points takes quite a long time. However, many have spent that time and much more. How do they generally progress? Equipment.</p>

<p>Most level 65s with moderate to high AAs begin to focus on equipment. It is their equipment and the equipment of their guild that gets them into the deeper reaches of the Planes of Power which lead to ... more equipment, which leads to Gates and ... more equipment. The cycle continues. New items are replaced with newer items with 10 more hitpoints. Raiders bank priceless no-drop gear many times over for that new shiny item.</p>

<p>It is at this time when the game changes. While high-end equipment in the Lost Dungeons adventure points exists, as do high-priced items in the bazaar, most powerful equipment for level 65s comes from raiding. In order to progress into new zones, you must have the right equipment. The only way to get that equipment is to raid.</p>

<p>Times were far worse than they are now. In the early days of Planes of Power, the excessive use of flags practically required raiding in order to get any of the three forms of progression. If you wanted new gear, new zones, or experience for new levels and AAs, raiding was your best option. Many friend-guilds split apart to feed the massive raiding guilds. For these guilds, raiding wasn't a fun side-adventure like it was in the days of Nagafen, raiding is their business and they do it every day.</p>

<p>The opening of many lower-tier planes and the new zones in Gates of Discord helped solve narrow direction. The sewers, Tipt, and Vxed offer experience rewards close to the deeper Planes. Zones like Ferubi and the first sets of the Breakdown in Communication quest give two or three groups a shot at some nice gear.</p>

<p>However, the gap still exists. The easiest way to acquire new equipment and new zones, two of the three forms of progression, is to join a raiding guild. Most people hit the wall of usefulness in AA progression at this point, whatever their guild. Equipment is the primary progression method and equipment leads to new zones.</p>

<p>It is this gap I ask SOE to fill. The Lost Dungeon adventure point system lets players work in small increments towards powerful gear. It lets SOE control the flow of equipment by controlling prices. LDON gear is no-drop so it doesn't effect the economy. Many times I recommended that SOE increase LDON gear to off-set the requirements for progression through raiding.</p>

<p>However even this should be a small focus for SOE. SOE needs to make the game more enjoyable at all levels. New features for all players keep them playing. Features like the tribute system (that admittedly needs work), the knowledge portals, soul binders, extra bank slots, armor dyes, and the bazaar help all players.</p>

<p>Low and mid-level players need new features as well although probably not through level, equipment, or zone content but with features that help them find groups or spend shorter amounts of time playing with profitable results.</p>

<p>Not every new feature helps every player, Everquest needs new raiding content, new levels above 65, new equipment beyond Time, especially when we see how far and fast powerful players travel through existing content. For these players, the faster they can get through the game the better, although it leads them faster and faster to the black gaping hole of space known as "the endgame". If they see it, they see the emptiness of their own progression. They see that none of it is real. They travel through that black void and end up in strange worlds of night elves or perhaps even a super-hero fighting armies of TV-helmeted villains. It is the will of the gods and the job of SOE to make sure we never see that black void. </p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>Note: This short story appeared in the July 2004 Everquest newsletter.</p>

    <p>Tiim watched the shoppers of the Freeport market as he always did on Saturday mornings. The exotic scents of a hundred different spices filled his nostrils. Dozens of the market's shoppers milled about the stalls, some from the soft and fat noble class, others rough and lean adventurers.</p>

    <p>Tiim watched the purses of these shoppers carefully. A coin or two from time to time might fall through careless fingers and Tiim must grab them if he wished to eat. If he became desperate enough he would have to cut the purse strings himself. To be caught in such an act meant losing his hands. A boy like Tiim needed his hands if he didn't want to starve.</p>

    <p>Tiim's eyes shifted to the pair of armored guards who scanned the people strolling by. Those near the guards kept their heads down and eyes forward. The tall guards, armored in steel breastplates, greaves, and bucket helms, kept their eyes out for people like Tiim.</p>

    <p>Most people have an ability to sense when they are being watched. When they feel eyes on them, even from behind, a person will turn and look without even knowing what they are looking for. A boy in Tiim's line of work, the work of thievery, knew this sense well. Tiim never looked directly at the guards or any other person.</p>

    <p>Tiim had further honed this sense. He didn't only know when he was being watched but when others were being watched as well. Someone else was watching the guards. Someone close. Tiim slowly turned and saw a figure studying the guards.</p>

    <p>The man was tall. A gray cloak and hood covered his face. Tiim saw the man's scruffy chin in the light of the morning sun. Two pinpoints of light reflected off of the man's eyes from within the shadow of the man's hood. Tiim made out the dull gleam of a mail shirt under the stranger's cloak. The man wore tall soft leather brown boots heavily seamed and coated in the dust of the road.</p>

    <p>The man turned his head towards Tiim and the young thief's heart jumped. He had been carefully taking note of the stranger from the corner of his eye but the stranger had felt his gaze anyway. Tiim yawned, his natural protective response in moments of high stress. He looked down and dragged the toe of his tattered cloth sandal in the dirt. The ruse of relaxation seemed to work. The hooded stranger looked away and back to the guards.</p>

    <p>A scuffle at one of the merchant tents took the guards' attention and the cloaked man moved quickly. The stranger headed to an alley, attempting to escape from the marketplace. He might have made it if two other guards hadn't come out of the very alley the stranger hoped to escape to. It was pure bad luck.</p>

    <p>One of the guards recognized the cloaked man and shouted. The other reached out to grab the stranger by the front of his cloak. There was a flash of movement and instantly the guard was on the ground holding his deformed broken wrist to his chest.</p>

    <p>The other guard began to draw his sword but the stranger drew his own shining silver shortsword and cut out to the side with speed far beyond the clumsy guard. Tiim saw a ribbon of blood in the air and the second guard crumpled to the ground.</p>

    <p>Tiim always trusted his instincts even if they made no logical sense. His instincts had kept him alive for thirteen years and today they would change his life forever. Tiim felt this instinct like a needle stuck into his spine and began to move.</p>

    <p>The two other guards raced towards the stranger just as the second of the two guards from the alley fell. They shoved and punched their way through the crowd and hit the cloaked man hard. The stranger ducked into a ball and hit the first rushing soldier at the knee. Tiim heard the snap of the guard's dislocated knee and saw him somersault onto his back howling in pain. The second guard clipped the cloaked man in the jaw with an iron-gauntleted fist. That is when Tiim arrived.</p>

    <p>Tiim's rusty dagger served him well over his years on the street. It was a part of him and it was no surprise that he found it in his hand even though he had no memory of drawing it. Without slowing down, Tiim's hand slashed out. A leather pouch fell from the cloaked man's belt and into Tiim's waiting hand. Tiim disappeared into the crowd. He had just a moment to see the stranger drop to both knees and hamstring the fourth guard with his gleaming shortsword.</p>

    <p>Tiim ran for an hour using every secret passage and hidden alley he knew. He darted into sub-basements and alcoves. He ran under the docks past the unseeing gazes of Freeport's street dregs. Finally after running down his favorite darkened alley, Tiim stopped.</p>

    <p>There the cloaked man waited for him.</p>

    <p>The man had thrown back his hood and Tiim saw his red hair pulled back over his pointed ears. The stranger, a half elf if Tiim had to guess, had his hands comfortably on his hips. The shortsword, hilted in shining gold and jewels, sat on his left hip.</p>

    <p>"I've never seen hands as fast as yours." The man's voice was even and smooth. A thousand lies came to Tiim's lips but Tiim saw in the half-elf's blazing green eyes that no lie would take. He knew of only one way to survive this confrontation. He held out the leather pouch.</p>

    <p>"I never saw you coming and I see everything," said the half-elf plucking the pouch from Tiim's hand. "I have need of someone like you."</p>

    <p>The man smiled so warmly that Tiim's guard immediately fell. In his whole life no one had ever smiled to Tiim with such kindness and warmth. If he had not been an orphan he might have recognized the smile as one given to a child from a pleased parent.</p>

    <p>"How would you like to join the Antonican Bards?"</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">1135@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>SOE released a large patch this week, one with many changes from the community feedback they received from the guild summit.  Read the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/recent_updates.jsp?id=62500">full patch message</a> and then continue for today's editorial.</p>

<p>More collision bug fixes should reduce the bugs we've seen even more.  Since the last update I personally haven't seen any of the big collision issues introduced with the Direct X 9 update.</p>

<p>The Plane of Knowledge now has a stone to the boat in Gunthak down in the evil section of the zone.  Lower level players now have much easier access to the zones from Legacy of Ykesha.  Changes allowing players to group and hunt more quickly are always welcome.</p>

<p>Quite a few changes were made to Gates of Discord.  Most of these changes affect zones beyond Kodtaz, a land few people can see.  The beasts that previously dropped class-specific spells now drop tokens.  Turning in the token returns a class appropriate spell.  In my hunts in the sewers, Tipt, and Vxed, I've seen spells drop only three times and each time it was for a class not present.  This is a welcome change.</p>

<p>A scripting change to Plane of Time shuts down unused instances of Time.  This helps guilds who became stuck because of a previous guild.  While Time instancing is still a large issue for high-end guilds, it doesn't appear it will be fixed before Omens of War is released at the end of August.</p>

<p>An NPC in the Plane of Knowledge will now teleport you to the Plane of Hate for a price.  This change has some wizards in uproar; previously the only way to the Plane of Hate was with a wizard's teleport.  The cost is higher for the NPC version and Plane of Hate isn't exactly the most popular zone so I don't see the change as a large one.</p>

<p>A new /guidehelp system lets players ask for assistance with in-game events such as weddings, GM quests, and server events.  I hope to see more GM events in the future.  GM events breathe life into an otherwise static game.  There is a lot of opportunity to enrich Norrath's lore through GM events like the Fironia Vie event in Kunark did years ago.  Most GM events became smaller in scope and did not affect the story line.  If GMs were handed a script or timeline of events to follow, the story of Norrath could grow over time through these dynamic events.</p>

<p>The raid management window received some changes including the ability to add notes to individual players, a Message of the Day feature, and the much needed ability to drop raid members who have left the zone.  Horror stories of raids having to disband and rebuild because of an AFK raid member are over.</p>

<p>The "/stopcast" command has many people scratching their heads.  The main reason people wanted it was to stop casting on horseback but the command specifically does not work on horseback.  SOE never meant horses to allow mana regeneration while moving.  Horses were designed to be a status symbol.  The meditation while riding became the most popular reason to buy a horse.  SOE has no intentions of "fixing" this "bug" but they will not improve it by allowing riders to cancel spells like they can do on their feet.  This has been a long-standing policy with horses and is unlikely to change.</p>

<p>A new PvP test server includes a variety of changes for player versus player combat.  New point-based armor rewards, new spell balancing, and rumors of an in-game hit-list complete with a reward system threaten to make PvP a fun place to play.  The violent and aggravated PvP server citizens receive little in the way of an update so this is a nice change for them.  As long as they don't bleed into my soft blue server and eat newbies, I'm happy.</p>

<p>New Lost Dungeon armor is under discussion though the developers continue to discuss the exact power of this armor.  Hopefully it's equivalent in scope to Elemental and Time items considering the requirement for such equipment in Gates of Discord.</p>

<p>Keep an eye out for some form of augment swapping in the next update.</p>

<p>While the changes in this week's patch mean little to most players, the updates in the future promise some exciting changes for characters of all levels and all paths.  Keep reading!<br />

<p>SOE will begin to release changes based on last week's guild summit next week. Only two changes are noted: a Plane of Knowledge stone for Gunthak and a way to clear empty instances of Time, but I wouldn't be surprised to see more soon.</p>

<p>The Gunthak portal helps level 30 to 50 players a lot. It wasn't exactly hard to run through Paineel, Warrens, and Stonebrunt, but its nice to skip them and head right to Gunthak. It saves a lot of time.</p>

<p>The Time change interests Time-capable guilds who ask repeatedly for an instanced Plane of Time. SOE had this at the top of their "future items" list. I heard whispers of a two month process to rebuild Plane of Time into an instanced zone. I would rather see revamps of Fear and Sky than see Time instanced for a select few. Like Sleepers Tomb, North TOV, and Vex Thal, Time will be put aside when the raiding guilds reach deep into Gates of Discord and start to battle in Omens of War. Quick changes to Time are fine but spending two months on it sounds extreme.</p>

<p>SOE is looking at new LDON gear to help smaller groups and guilds gear up for Gates of Discord. This could help open up more options for single-group hunters as well as raiders who need one or two items they can't seem to get in raids. Gates has a lot of single-group instanced trials including the four sewers, Vxed, Tipt, single group hunting in KodTaz, and the three infamous Ikkinz trials. All of these are available to single groups if you're able to get to them and survive. Vxed, Tipt and above are tuned for Plane of Time and "Time+" level players.</p>

<p>The subject of new LDON gear brings up a few unanswered questions. How much will high-end LDON items cost? How powerful will they be? Will there be other requirements to reach them? Some developers feel that simply awarding it for adventure points is too easy, that some sort of greater challenge must exist to acquire these items. I don't agree. While raid leaders and long-time raiders face great challenges, people slip into mature raiding guilds and acquire massive amounts of armor without seeing that challenge. 30 to 60 hours of LDON hunting is long enough to acquire high-end Elemental or Time tier 1 or 2 loot.</p>

<p>Augment swapping is on the way. Augment swapping solvents will most likely require a trade skill to create. There will be a cost associated with augment swapping, but the cost is not yet determined.</p>

<p>SOE also discussed refunding adventure points on LDON items. People may spend 1500 points on a LDON breastplate and then bank it when a new one comes along. SOE hasn't worked out the details yet but a 50% refund has been discussed. Considering my bank is full of my purple Hate armor, my Skyshrine quest armor, and about a dozen outdated bits of treasure, I think a 50% refund is generous. No drop armor is outdated all the time.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention last week that SOE plans to release a level 40 to 55 LDON raid to Stormhammer and then the rest of the servers soon. LDON raids were initially designed for Plane of Time raiders with little else to do. Unfortunately, no raids were developed for lower level or lower power adventurers. The set duration, difficulty, and player numbers of LDON instanced raids allow for extremely tailored raid encounters for all levels. I hope we see more LDON raids for levels 55s to 65s with gear below elemental.</p>

<p>I had a chance to hunt in the Sewers of Barindu recently and enjoyed the changes I saw. The mobs hit for 66% of the damage they used to. Moderately equipped tanks can tank normal mobs and as a Cleric I had to work for a living again without being overwhelmed. The experience was good but could use a boost when compared to the Planes with their graveyards and easy access. Named mobs were still quite hard and a gating mob ended up wiping us out, but the experience was good and the loot was not bad.</p>

<p>My CR was a disaster. I died once in Qinimi on my way back to Barindu, my body got stuck under the earth, and it ended up decomposing before I could get a GM to summon it. I still want more CR options than having to spend two hours after a loss to recover. Death should be painful but there should be options.</p>

<p>Painful CR or not, I will go back to the sewers.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It's been quite a weekend. </p>

<p>SOE loves their game.  Almost the entire staff of designers, artists, programmers, customer service representatives, and management are former players who joined SOE because they love the game.  Every attendee of the guild summit I spoke with never felt that SOE fed them a line.  Only twice did <span title="Brenlo is the best guy ever">Brenlo</span> hold his tongue in response to my questions; one when asked about SOE's plan with IGE and later when asked about focus effects above 65, a subject not yet decided.  Every developer spoke clearly and in detail with every question I asked.</p>

<p>"Gush on, valiant Fanboi!" you shout, but let me reveal the darker side.  Though Smedley said that the bulk of active EQ players were below level 50 I only know of one or two attendees of the sixty that play characters below level 65 and both hardly play anymore.  I learned on the first night that SOE developers have a private forum with raiding guild leaders to discuss raid encounter tuning.  I can't help but wonder why no such forum for single-group players exists.</p>

<p>After nearly ten hours of focus groups and future discussions Brenlo handed out <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7457">a list of twenty issues</a> SOE would review and implement very soon.  Of these twenty, twelve of them were raid specific and most of the rest were general fixes.  Only one focused on casual content: a solo instanced encounter of some sort.</p>

<p>Many single group issues came up, however, and SOE reacted positively.  I left at least half a dozen copies of <a href="http://mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1950615164">Loral's Evil Agenda</a> in the hands of SOE employees including Robert Pfister, Executive Producer of Everquest (who had already read it but politely accepted it before wrapping the remains of his hot dog in it and casually tossing it over his shoulder).</p>

<p><span title="Smed Loves the pirate!">John Smedley</span> stated first that Gates of Discord's release was SOE's worst mistake in five years.  He personally apologized.  I spent my day job listening to managers who speak often and say little.  Smedley was the opposite.  His introduction gave the statistic that most active EQ players are below 50 and revealed that EQ and EQ2 development teams receive royalties for their games individually.  This dispells the theory that SOE is secretly trying to wean us off of EQ and onto EQ2.  The EQ team wants to keep us playing as long as possible.  Rod Humble augmented this address stating that while voices often state that Velious is SOE's best expansion (I still think LDON is), Ykesha is the best selling expansion.  Many attendees attribute this to shared bank space, but I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>Smedley revealed the failed plan to bring out level 65 to 70 during the fifth year anniversary two months ago and Brenlo confirmed that SOE designed Gates of Discord with level 70 in mind.  This explains a lot of the expansion's difficulty.  I spoke with just about anyone who would listen about the overly long duration of sewer, Vxed, and Tipt trials and the designers agreed that four hours for an often failed event was too long.  Whether it's fixed before we see level 70 or not is hard to say.  SOE designed Gates to be very hard.</p>

<p>Later I asked Smedley to confirm the rumor that we would have new PC models before the end of 2004 and he confirmed it.  SOE is outsourcing the project to another company, an act that vexes SOE artists.  It's their baby and they want to do the models but there simply isn't the time, a statement we heard often.  The developers who spoke at the initial meeting stated that they want and expect Everquest to stand up graphically to other current massive online games including EQ2.  The graphic update we battled through recently helps us get there.</p>

<p>The shifting number of allowed players in raid encounters between Planes of Power, Lost Dungeons, and Gates of Discord frustrates a lot of guilds and leads to many players quitting.  Everquest's designers stated that 54 is the new official number for future Everquest raids.</p>

<p>Though focused on raid content, all love of the single-group gamer is not lost.  Brenlo confirmed that new high-end elemental level equipment will update the LDON adventure merchants.  Single-group hunters will be able to gear up for Gates of Discord content without Time or Elemental access.  Omens of War includes only one flagged zone though certain encounters may be locked.  This resembles Kunark, Velious, and Luclin expansions where most of the content was open to all players.  Omens of War includes zones for all players tuned to help characters level up to 70.</p>

<p>SOE based the high cost of AAs on the experience found in the Plane of Fire, a zone many single-group hunters cannot yet reach.  While Omens zones will offer experience zones to help non-flagged hunters, SOE should up the experience in Tipt, Vxed, and the sewers closer to Fire than they are now.  The difficulty in reaching these zones and the difficulty in the encounters warrants the experience boost.</p>

<p>While SOE designed Epic 2.0s to be the best class items available to the most powerful raiders, Epic 1.5s will be available to high level players and require only one or two groups to complete.</p>

<p>It was an amazing weekend filled with the obnoxious rings of cell phones, one so loud that its owner cried out to his deity in shock and horror.  The icy glare of the guild leader from the dark and frightening Rallos Zek server gazed over us bluebies like we had green target circles under our feet.  Twice I became stuck between Gilfalas of <a href="http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=19890.topic">Paladin's of Norrath</a> and Raaj of <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7457">The Steel Warriors</a> who crashed together in debate over Defensive.</p>

<p>Ryan Robinson, the Sheriff of Norrath and customer support supervisor told the story of a trade scam buried under over thirty transfers from different accounts that took two weeks to track down, but they did.  This fellow needs his own Stephen Bocco police drama.  40% of the 47,000 petitions the CS department receives monthly are lost items and 70% of these are scams of some sort.  A lot of CS's day is chasing ghosts.</p>

<p>Here's a brief summary of the things I found most interesting:</p>

<p>- We will have new PC models by the end of the year.<br />
- New high-end high-cost items will be available on LDON adventure merchants.<br />
- Gates was designed for level 70, thats why its so hard.<br />
- Rallos Zek is a chaotic server of horror and villainy.<br />
- Gilfalas just wants "a little something!"<br />
- Omens of War has only one locked zone, the rest of it is open to all players.<br />
- While Epic 2.0s are for the uberist of the ubers, Epic 1.5s are available to the rest of us.<br />
- Some sort of instanced solo adventure is in the works.<br />
- The Omens of War task system, a small 30 minute quest system, will be available to levels 20 and above.<br />
- There will be a quest for Gates of Discord spells, though details aren't available.<br />
- Chat channels cross over between Everquest and Everquest 2.<br />
- The development team wishes they never called it Everquest 2.<br />
- Soon augments can be removed and replaced on other items.<br />
- Smedley loves pirates.<br />
- The graphic engine update we went through will help EQ stay graphically competitive with other MMOGs.</p>

<p>There are dozens of other reports of the summit including posts on <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7457">Steel Warriors</a>, <a href="http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=19890.topic">Paladins of Norrath</a>, <a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org/viewtopic.php?p=145875">The Safehouse</a>, <a href="http://forums.gucomics.com/viewtopic.php?t=2220">GU Comics</a>, <a href="http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4178">The Rune</a>, <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=5406">Caster's Realm</a>, <a href="http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=8094">The Druid's Grove</a> and a lot of places I haven't found yet.  Druid's Grove even <a href="http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=8098">has pictures</a> including some unfortunate ones of <a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/images/summitspring2004/bus1.jpg">your fearless writer, Loral</a> (I'm the one in the black shirt on the right).</p>

<p>I received a lot of positive feedback from at least six other attendees I spoke with on the way back home and feedback from the postings above agree.  SOE is working hard to improve Everquest and fix previous mistakes.  Though not all of my agenda points were met; mainly what I wanted to hear was "Lost Dungeons 2 in December"; I am very happy with the direction things are going.  I look forward to the next few months.</p>

<p>Our world is strong.</p>

<p>Next week SOE is hosting a visit for guild leaders and community representatives to talk about the state of the Everquest and get feedback.  This article outlines the evil agenda I plan to bring to San Diego and hand to the Everquest developers.  </p>

<p>I cannot speak for the entire community. I read the message boards every day.  I play hours every night.  I talk to low level players, high level players, raiders, casual hunters, trade-skillers, and everyone in between and I have no doubt that I am missing the majority of opinions.  We have no idea what all 400,000 players think.  Few players post to message forums. Few players send feedback. Few players even bother to read websites like this one.  It's impossible to know what they think needs to be fixed. I can, however, give my view on the state of Everquest and the features I believe will help the game. </p>

<p>Lets begin Loral's Evil Agenda:</p>

<ul>
<li>Focus on single-group content.</li>
<li>Offer easier corpse recovery in old world and GoD zones.</li>
<li>Offer quest, adventure-point, or vendor alternatives for level 65 and GoD spells.</li>
<li>Offer progressive content in 30 minutes or less.</li>
<li>Add higher-end equipment to LDON adventure merchants.</li>
<li>Add more Lost Dungeon content including zones, adventure types, and rewards.</li>
<li>Make the Sewers, Vxed, and Tipt easier to get to, easier to recover from, easier to battle in, and offer more significant rewards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Focus on single-group content.  The six-person group was once the single unit that all content was balanced against.  Planes of Power and Gates of Discord put raiding and raid-equipped players above moderately equipped single groups.  Increase content for single groups.  Increase high-end equipment opportunities for single group hunters.  Use adventure merchants, expeditions, and instanced zones to bring more content and progression opportunities to single group hunters.  Make the six person group the focus of Everquest again.</p>

<p>Offer easier corpse recovery for old world and Gates of Discord zones.  Planes of Power and Lost Dungeons of Norrath offer excellent escapes for nasty corpse recoveries.  Befallen, Blackburrow, Kaesora, Dalnirs Crypt, and all other old-world dungeons offer no such option.  The Plane of Fear has a higher risk than any raiding zone in Planes of Power.  Don't punish Befallen hunters with horrible corpse recoveries while Plane of Fire hunters recover in 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Offer quest, adventure-point, or vendor alternatives for level 65 and GoD spells.  For single group hunters, level 65 spells are rare and gates of discord spells are almost non-existent.  Offer quests or adventure point systems for high level spells.  Give casual hunters a clear path to these spells.   Place level 65 and GoD spells on LDON adventure merchants or add a similar system to GoD.</p>

<p>Offer progressive content in 30 minutes or less.  Many players have limited play time.  There is little progress anyone can make in thirty minutes.  Many people solo and work on trade skills when they have limited time.  Improve solo content; improve trade skill content; add adventure-point based task systems.</p>

<p>Add higher-end equipment to LDON adventure merchants.  Lost Dungeons offers a fair and consistent method for acquiring equipment.  Players are able to progress towards powerful gear in small steps.  This equipment lacks power when compared to Elemental, Time, and GoD equipment.  Add high-cost equipment with two slot 3s, higher power melee weapons, and augments with the higher-end focus effects such as Marr's Gift, Preservation of Xegony, Mana Regeneration +3 and +4, and Faerune.</p>

<p>Add more Lost Dungeon content including zones, adventure types, and rewards.  Many players love Lost Dungeons and want more adventure types, zones, and lower power raid content.  Add new adventure types and rebalance the rescue and assassination quests.  Increase the cash and experience rewards.  Use the expedition feature of Gates of Discord in Lost Dungeons so people can come and leave in the early parts of an adventure.</p>

<p>Make the Sewers, Vxed, and Tipt easier to get to, easier to recover from, easier to battle in, and offer more significant rewards.  These zones are very hard for their current rewards and many powerful groups fail in the last few minutes of a four hour hunt.  Tune these zones for high level characters without raid-level equipment.</p>

<p>Minor Quips and Suggestions:</p>

<p>Fix sitting animations for male elves.  Why do I still look like a statue when I sit?</p>

<p>Revamp Sky and Fear.  Fear is the only zone left where people cannot get a safe summon at the zone in.  It is the hardest of the Planes with the worst loot.  The time for three-day sky raids is over.  Let Call of the Hero work in Sky.</p>

<p>Debug quests.  A lot of people fail on quests when they hand in stacks.  The rat whisker quest still eats stacks of rat wiskers without returning them.  Buggy quests frustrate players of all levels.  Add better quality control to quest and trade skill content.</p>

<p>Support dual-monitor systems.  I'd love to put my buff and extra chat windows on another monitor while using my main monitor for the world view, target, and group windows.  Duel monitor support adds a lot of capability for high-end systems.</p>

<p>Offer partial refunds on adventure-merchant augments.  A 50% refund wouldn't unbalance the game and would give people some points back for future gear.</p>

<p>No more rats, bats, and spiders.  I've fought these throughout my 65 levels and 260 AA points.  Its time I fought nothing smaller than a armadillo.</p>
