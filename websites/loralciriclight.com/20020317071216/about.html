    <h1 class="title">About This Site</h1>


    <p>Tales of Loral Ciriclight is a collection of stories based around a character in the game <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/" title="The worst digital addiction since Tetris">Everquest</a>. Loral is hosted on the Quellious server, and was created in May of 2000. He is a member of the prestigious guild, <a href="http://www.healersunited.com/" title="The Greatest Guild in Norrath, and no I am not biased">Healers United</a>. This group prides itself on seeking a higher goal than the typical hunting and gathering of powerful beasts and magical weapons. We seek to help all the citizens of Norrath in their time of need. Many of the articles were written for the guild's monthly e-zine, <a href="http://thehealingzone1.homestead.com/mag2index1.html" title="The official fan-zine of Healers United">The Healing Zone</a>.</p>
