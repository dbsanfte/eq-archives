<h1 class="title">Chapter 2: Trapmaw</h1>

    <p>Tarlin crouched down and placed two fingers on the red patch of blood in the snow. The agent of the Emerald Guardians narrowed his blue eyes and peered into the blizzard around him. The blood was warm, Trapmaw was near. With his bow in hand, Tarlin continued his hunt. His hide boots never broke the snow as he walked around the giant prints of the great bear.</p>

    <p>For two weeks Tarlin had traveled west of the dwarven city of Moradim, and had arrived to the village of Diren.  The barbarians treated Tarlin as cold as the icy wind. They cared little for the troubles of elves and had not heard of the Emerald Guardians.  They had agreed to part with the hammer the elven overseer of Fayspires required, but Tarlin would have to perform a task in return.  Tarlin didn't like the exchange of looks the barbarians gave as they explained it.</p>

    <p>For two hundred years Trapmaw ruled the icy lands of the north.  Four hundred battles the giant bear had faced.  The stubs of twenty arrows protruded from the ancient bear's chest like badges of victory.  Trapmaw had faced this elf twice so far with neither managing to defeat the other, but today the venerable bear would kill this persistent elf.</p>

<p>Tarlin could feel the ground rumble beneath him and the roar chilled him to the bone. Tarlin fired his bow. The flaming arrow traced across the night air leaving a smoking trail behind it. Tarlin immediately fired another arrow before the first sunk deep into the thick hide of the bear.  Trapmaw was upon him.  The bear reared up and slammed a huge paw down, hoping to crush the elf.  Tarlin side-stepped the blow, slammed his foot down to trap the paw in the ice, and fired a third arrow into the neck of the two thousand pound bear.</p>

    <p>Trapmaw swiped Tarlin aside with his free paw. Tarlin rolled and came up quickly, sidestepping another overhead blow that sunk into the snow. Tarlin drew his shining blade and cut deep into Trapmaw's shoulder.  Trapmaw raked Tarlin's chest with four inch claws, cutting deep wounds in Tarlin's chest and knocking him to the ground.  The bear stood its full twelve feet and came down hard, hoping to crush the tiny elf.  Tarlin pointed his blade up and slammed the hilt into the ice.  The bear came crashing down.  The roar could be heard all across the icy lands.  Then silence.  Trapmaw, the two hundred year old bear was dead.</p>

    <p>The people of Diren were amazed when the elf walked through their gates again. Nothing stole their words more than the site of the massive paw strapped to the elf's back. The smith happily gave over the magical hammer the elf had asked for. Tarlin left Diren the following morning, heading north through the lands of the Freezebloods and to the city of Halas.   Whispers of "Trapmaw bane" followed him as he left.</p>
