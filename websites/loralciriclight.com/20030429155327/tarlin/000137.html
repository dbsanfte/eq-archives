<h1 class="title">Chapter 3: Varik</h1>

<p>The spires of Neriak cut into the grey sky like blades of black swords.  Varik stepped out of the front doorway of the black city and into the wilds around it.   It was his first real patrol outside the city gates.</p>

<p>The rest of his scouting party walked ahead.  Their instructor, a scarred shadowknight named Klantag, walked ahead.  The female cleric and the other warrior followed.  Varik walked behind.</p>

<p>The party traveled north to investigate rumors of fire-goblins near the northern camp.  They moved through the dead woods of Nektulos and to the rocky lands beyond.  Xuzlek the cleric, scowled at the lands around her, her dark purple robes a contrast to the dirty lands around them.  Not feeling as confident Varik held his halbard tightly, trying to find security in its sharp tip.</p>

<p>Klantag stopped them with an outstretched palm and drew his slender longsword.  He crouched down and the other dark elves followed his lead.  Four goblins lumbered over the hill ahead, their red sagging skin hanging off of their unnaturally strong arms.  Nervous energy shot into Varik's hands.  He preparing to stab one in the chest as soon as the oppertunity arose.  He had patience, though, and it saved his life.</p>

<p>Xuzlek the cleric began whispering a prayer to the dark god Innoruuk and her hands flared with power.  The lead goblin's chest exploded into green blood and gore.  Klantag cursed. The furthest goblin raised a hand of his own and began chanting.  A wave of black insects grew to life in front of the goblin and soared towards Xuzlek.  They covered her from head to toe and began to feed.  She opened her mouth to scream, but more of the insects flowed in.  She let out a shallow gurgle as the insects tore into her throat and then fell dead to the muddy ground.</p>

<p>Klantag drew a small axe from his worn belt and threw hard.  The axe spun head over handle then cracked into the shaman's head.  The goblin fell back stiff-legged, dead before he hit the ground.  Klantag rushed and cut with his black longsword, beheading another of the red goblins.</p>

<p>The remaining goblin, seeking the oppertunity to strike, raised his sword and rushed at Varik and the other remaining warrior.  Varik reacted, kicking the goblin's knee and hearing the splintering of bone.  Varik stabbed his halbard through the goblin's chest and out its back.  The goblin shuttered and went still.</p>

<p>The war party was silent as they returned to Neriak.  Old Klantag carried Xuzlek's medallion of Innoruuk back to the church.  Varik returned to his quarters.  He didn't sleep for two days.  As soon as his eyes began to close he saw a thousand tiny insects and heard the gurgling sound of Xuzlek's stifled scream. It was the end of his first patrol.</p>
