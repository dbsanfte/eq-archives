      <p>Loral was the son of a jewel dealer, a widower, in the fine city of Felwithe. His father was a good man, but always had an eye out for profit. One day, a strange traveler came in and sold him a magical hammer said to send demons back into hell with one blow. The hammer was a mighty piece and very valuable, but Loral's father had no intention of selling it. One night, a figure came to their door. He was taller than a man, with pale blue skin. When Loral's father approached him, the figure pulled back his hood and introduced himself as the Maestro of Rancor, sent to retrieve the feared weapon for his lord, Innoruuk. Loral's father attacked with the mighty weapon but when he slammed the magic hammer into the demon, the Maestro laughed, embraced Loral's father and they both disappeared into the plane of Hate. Loral never saw his father again.</p>

      <p>Now an orphan, Loral was taken in by the local Church of Tunare where he began his life as a priest. He was happy with his duties, but always dreamed of the riches and adventure life had to offer. One day he met a Cleric of Quellious from the far away land of Erudin named Ciric Azilebane along with his long time companion, the wizard Azile Ciricbane. They traded tales of their adventures with the young Loral, telling him of the beauty of the Karanas, the awesome magicks of Erudin and the horrors of Unrest. Loral was enthralled hearing their stories. A month passed, Azile had left for the lands of Raithe, but Ciric had decided it was time to hang up his adventuring boots and settle down. He took Loral under his wing and cultivated his dreams of traveling the lands of Norrath. Time came for Loral to begin his adventures, and on the day of his departure to the dwarven city of Kaladim, Ciric handed him a pack containing all of his old adventuring equipment. Loral doned the armor and wielded Ciric's mighty Shining Star of Light as he left the city to spread the word of Tunare and live the life of an adventurer.</p>

      <p>The horrors of seeing his father taken away from this world gave Loral a hatred of all unnatural beasts especially the vile undead that infested the lands. He hunted many moons in the lands of Butcherblock, ridding it of the dwarven skeletons and listening to the tales of the mighty travelers that passed through. It was during this time that he met the group Healers United, a guild who traveled the lands to bring back life and peace in a world of hatred and fear. He knew immediately he had found his place among the members of the guild and did his best to spread the word of Tunare in their name.</p>

      <p>Being raised by a jewel dealer gave Loral a keen eye for the marketplace. He traded often at the bazaars and was always quick and keen in the art of the haggle. While his true love and purpose is to spread the will of Tunare, he always enjoys browsing the wares of the Oasis bazaar.</p>

      <p>Still the memories of his father being snatched by the demons of hate flooded his mind, keeping him isolated from society. He traveled into the <a href="ro.html">desert of Ro</a>, hoping to chase away these demons that haunted his mind with the ancient techniques taught to him by Ciric and by reading a tome of knowledge known as the Testament of Vanear, a book given to him by Azile, the arch wizard, his traveling protector in the harsh world. While he learned much and became even more powerful as an instrument of Tunare, he still tasted the poison of hate that Innoruuk had left in his life.</p>

<p>Throughout his travels Loral has acquired a powerful collection of magical items and artifacts.  For his time in the Halls of Testing, the Claws of Veeshan awarded him with Akkirus's Armor of the Risen, a suit of armor enchanted with the spiritual essence of the dragon-priest Akkirus.  His boots are a soft leather colored red from the ooze of a red slime in the depths of the Temple of Cazic Thule.  A ring on his right hand acts as a key to the inner sanctum of Emperor Ssraeshza.  Loral wears an eyepatch of Torbin modified into a pair of spectacles, one lense shaded blue and the other green giving him ultravision and allowing him to see through invisibility.  Around his head is a coil of twisted platnum wire that focuses his thoughts. His primary weapon is the hammer, Daninulaer, one of the spiritual Hammers of Damnation.  Loral also carries one of the Water Sprinklers of Nem Ankh, an artifact of the Triumverate that returns life to any fallen ally.  Loral carries many items from the outer planes that allow him to better focus and channel Tunare's power.</p>

<p>Two of Loral's other magical items include a bridal of summoning for his Planar horse, Illuminia, and a strange gnomish box that locates the bodies of his comrades to be resurrected later.  The grotesque box makes sniffing noises as it points Loral towards his fallen friends.</p>

<p>His most interesting and dangerous item is a Circular Shield of the Blaze possessed or partially possessed by the demon prince Xuzl, a servant of Solusek Ro.  The demon-possessed shield protects Loral from almost all fire and channels Loral's energy into a more chaotic and destructive blast.  Loral and the trapped demon are often in mental conflict with neither ever gaining the upper hand.  While other powers may be embedded in the shield, they have yet to show themselves fully.</p>

      <p>The following are summaries of the <a href="./">tales of Loral Ciriclight</a>. More information can be gained by reading the full stories first.</p>

      <h2>The Fist of Innoruuk</h2>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/hu_naggy_raid.jpg" title="The Battle of Lord Nagafin"><img src="./images/hu_naggy_raid_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Battle of Lord Nagafin" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Under the direction of the Church of Tunare and with the help of his new friends, Healers United, Loral traveled to the lands of Kunark in search of the lady Fironia Vie. There he discovered the plots between the great <a href="scale.html">Ring of Scale</a>, the lich-king Venril Sather and the ancient dragon constructs, the Sarnak. With the help of many of Norrath's adventurers, Loral assisted in the <a href="nagafen.html">slaying of the great Lord Nagafin</a> and the undead poison dragon, <a href="trakanon.html">Trakanon</a>, as well as an <a href="fear.html">assault on the Plane of Fear</a>, home of the minions of the demon-god Cazic Thule.</p>

      <p>During his assaults of the Sarnak Fortress of Ill Omen, Loral <a href="kithicor.html">learned of a plot</a> against his mentor, Ciric Azilebane. He quickly helped defeat the plotted assassination by killing the Dark Elf General who planned it. During this battle, Loral discovered a dark mace of great power, an ancient artifact of Bloody Kithcor.</p>

      <p>Filled with a newfound bloodlust, Loral <a href="battle.html">waged an assault</a> against four powerful figures of the plot against Fironia Vie. Korasal Klyseer, Prince Selrahc Di'Zok, the vampire Xalgoz and Venril Sather himself were killed during the attacks. Still, Loral's vengence was not satisfied with their deaths.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/innoruuk_fight.jpg" title="The battle with Innoruuk"><img src="./images/innoruuk_fight_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The battle with Innoruuk" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>It was discovered by his friends in Healers United, that the dark mace Loral carried was a vehicle of influence for the dark elf god, Innoruuk. With it, he convinced Loral to open a gateway to the Plane of Hate. Convinced he would slay the Avatar of Innoruuk in Antonica's Arena, Loral used ancient magiks discovered in the libraries of Kaesora and Chardok to open the gateway. Innoruuk, knowing he would be victorious in such a battle, planned to invade all of Norrath.</p>

      <p>The Healers confronted Loral and told him of Innoruuks plot. Enraged, Loral killed the young cleric Idoru and forced the Healers into combat. Minions of Innoruuk battled the Healers but they were victorious and the dark mace was destroyed. Loral was resurrected by the leader of Healers United, Dahlea, and released from the influence of the dark god.</p>

      <p>Haunted by his actions and seeking freedom from the torments of the death of his father, <a href="darkness.html">Loral confronted Innoruuk</a> within the Plane of Hate. A great assault was waged against the dark lord and after a bloody battle, the demon god was slain.</p>

      <h2>War of Ice</h2>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/giant_war_2.jpg" title="The war of Ice"><img src="./images/giant_war_2.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The war of Ice" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Faced with the horrors of his actions and still shaking free the dark influence from his spirit, Loral sought solitude within the icy lands of Velious. Here he befriended the Coldain Dwarves and <a href="kromrif.html">assisted in their battles</a> against the Ice Giants.</p>

      <p>Loral joined in many assaults against the ice giants including some within their city of Kael Drakkal. He soon learned that the giants wished to lay siege to the Plane of Growth, home to Loral's goddess, Tunare. The defeat of the Avatar of Tunare and the poisoning of the lands of Lesser Faydark kept the Elven empire of Felwithe from assisting in the <a href="trouble.html">war of Ice</a>. Loral was forced to seek allies with another much more mysterious group, the <a href="claws.html">Claws of Veeshan</a>.</p>

      <p>While Azile <a href="hsagras_wrath.html">researched ancient powers of the dragon Hsagra</a>, Loral traveled through the icy lands of the Western Wastes. Here he discovered the great temple of Veeshan, an ancient monument to the crystaline dragon built long before Loral's race ever walked Norrath. <a href="the_test.html">Loral was tested</a> by the great dragonkin of the Claws in their Halls of Testing along with many other adventurers who sought the wisdom and strength of the dragons. Loral was given much more than the artifacts rewarded to him after succeeding in the tests, he was given a larger understanding of the ways in which Norrath lives.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/loral_closeup.jpg" title="Loral in the Temple of Veeshan"><img src="./images/loral_closeup_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral in the Temple of Veeshan" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Soon, Loral joined with his friend Azile, now one of the most powerful sorceresses in Norrath, and waged a <a href="vindication.html">final assault</a> against the city of Kael. Here, assisting the powerful hunter guild, Lotus Cult, Loral witnessed the defeat of both the guardian, Derakor the Vindicator, and the lord of Kael, King Tormax.</p>

      <p>Returning home, Loral was rewarded with the title High Priest of Tunare for his actions in protection of the Mother of All. A new mission was given to Loral. To travel through the recently awakened portals to the moon of Luclin and discover what he could of the new lands. Half excited to be visiting such mysterious lands and half understanding the Church's memory of his influence under Innoruuk, Loral accepted and along with his friends, traveled to the moon of Luclin.</p>

      <h2>Darkness and Light</h2>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="/images/hollowshade_cave.jpg" title="Loral in Hollowshade Moore"><img src="/images/hollowshade_cave_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral in Hollowshade Moore" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Accepting the mission of the exploration of the new strange lands, Loral traveled along with many seasoned adventurers to the <a href="luclin.html">lands of Luclin</a>. He spent many days in the town of Shadowhaven and purchased a magical bridal that summoned a great magical horse named Illumina. He traveled through the underground passages, wrought with dangerous beasts never seen on Norrath to discover a lush magical land outside the cat city of Shar Val. Little did he know that back on Norrath his barbarian servant and tradesman, Bonescar, had been assassinated.</p>

      <p>Loral explored much of the lands of Luclin, joining up with an adventuring party from Healers United. Together they traveled to the canyons of Mons Letalis where they discovered the <a href="spirelord.html">ruins of once-mighty teleportation spires</a>. Entering a cave at the base of the mountain supporting the great spires they confronted and defeated the spire spirits, the ghosts of long-dead wizards or minions from the plane of shadows, and their ruler, the Spire Lord.</p>

      <p>Using a powerful artifact known as the Faithstone of Nature, Loral returned to his hometown of Felwithe and received further instructions from the High Priest of Felwithe, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf. Loral was to return to Luclin and track down a lost Kaoa'dal paladin who had been exploring the ruined temple of the Shissar.</p>

      <p>Loral had written a book on <a href="iksar_history.html">Iksar history</a>, a subject he found fascinating regardless of their worship of the faceless god, Cazic Thule. He found their society to be one of once great nobility and impossible hardships. He knew that all the great strength of the three great Iksar empires was due to the horrible conditions of life as slaves to the Shissar. To hear of the discovery of Shissar ruins on Luclin was to hear of a great darkness indeed.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="/images/sshraeshza.jpg" title="Temple of Ssraeshza"><img src="/images/sshraeshza_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Temple of Ssraeshza" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Meeting up with fellow adventurers from the Healers, Loral <a href="the_grey.html">traveled to the Grey</a>. There he and his friends battled many of the undead and magical creations that scourged the wasteland surrounding the powerful blue temple. In a great battle, they defeated a great clay golem that protected the temple from outside eyes. A few days later, Loral's party disbanded and he went alone into the black mouth of the evil Temple.</p>

      <p>As he entered <a href="ssraeshza.html">the Temple of Ssraeshza</a>, Loral quickly found himself whisked away by a hunting party of Lotus Cult, the guild of his old friend, the sorceress Azile Ciricbane. The powerful hunters took him down into the mines below the temple where Loral discovered more of the horrors of the Shissar empire and one very dangerous fact. The Shissar were attempting to escape the confines of their temple and once again rule over the known worlds. Once again, Loral used the Faithstone to return home, but this time it didn't work.</p>

      <p>The teleportation of the Faithstone was routed by the ancient magics of the serpent rulers and Loral was taken by the Shissar interrogators. For unknown hours the interrogators, led by a great glyphed serpent, sent <a href="darkness.html">false memories</a> into Loral's mind. These memories built an entire reality for Loral, all with the intent of distilling his mind and receiving what they could. For what seemed to be a century of life, Loral believed every memory they implanted. Soon, however, a great burning in his had showed him of the false-life and he <a href="light.html">broke free</a> from the shackles the Shissar held against him. At this same time the hunters of Lotus Cult attacked and killed Loral's captors and he was able to escape to the city of Felwithe via the Faithstone.</p>

      <p>Loral returned soon enough with the hunters of Lotus Cult and aided them in their battle against the emperor of the Shissar, <a href="godslayer.html">the Godslayer</a>, Ssraeshza. In a massive battle combining all known races and religions of Norrath, the hunters defeated the ancient Shissar king and saved Norrath from falling once again into his clutches.</p>

      <p>Loral returned to Shadowhaven and spent much of his time in retrospect over all that he had learned. Many great changes he had seen in 100 years of service as an adventurer of Tunare. The fading of the lines between the races being the greatest of them all. No longer did the races kill each other on site, now accepting their differences and even banding together for the greater good of all their kingdoms.</p>

      <p>They would need it, for soon opened the doorway to the outer planes and a danger they couldn't begin to expect.</p>

      <h2>The Outer Planes</h2>

<p>Unsure of his place within the Church, the Council of Felwithe sends Loral to investigate the newly discovered gateways to the <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/000092.html">outer planes</a>.  Still <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/000204.html">tormented</a> by his false memories during his captivity by the Shissar, Loral dives into the outer planes with vigor and assists in many <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/000093.html">huge battles</a> against <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/000142.html">younger</a> and <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/000155.html">older gods</a> alike.  His adventures in these outer worlds change Loral, filling him with new power and allowing him to discover many lost and powerful magical artifacts.</p>

<p> One of these artifacts, a shield found in the Tower of Solusek Ro within the Plane of Fire, <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/000145.html">contains at least a piece of the arch-demon Xuzl</a>, a servant of Solusek Ro.  The <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/000129.html">demon was slain</a> by the raiding party, Lotus Cult, and somehow a piece of the demon's soul was trapped within the shield.  Xuzl <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/001028.html">spoke to Loral in dreams and visions</a> as well as direct conversation, hoping to bargain or force his release upon the world of Norrath where he would surely prosper among the corpses of mortals.</p>

<p>Years later, <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/000199.html">Loral would trick the demon</a>.  He would release the demon within a cavern deep underneith Felwithe, and with the aid of magical and physical bonds, would trap the demon forever.<p>

<p>Today, however, the demon still speaks to Loral, trading power for control.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The sun felt as heavy as the mace Loral carried through the desert of Ro. The normal gleam of his dwarven chainmail was dull from the dust and grime that constantly beat on him, seeming to come from every direction at once. Still his eyes narrowed, ignoring the bite of the hot wind, while he tracked his prey. He lifted two fingers and said a small three word prayer to Tunare. Sparks flew from his forehead, turning his attention west, guiding him again to the elusive creature he hunted. He climbed the dune in front of him and once reaching the peak he saw his prey.</p>

      <p>"There is a form of evil in this land that should have never been" he remembered his mentor, Ciric, stating one day as they listened to the peaceful rush of water at the edge of the river in the elven city of Felwithe. Loral was just a wild teenager back then, hardly sixteen seasons old but ready to take on all the evil that Norrath had to offer. He remembered the lifeless look in Ciric's eyes more than the words as he spoke as he described the horrible plague of undead that seemed to reach out of the darkness of Hate and into the once peaceful land. "It is our job as the vehicle of our God to rid the lands of this plague," the tall Erudite cleric continued as if reading Loral's thoughts. Loral always got excited imagining himself citing a word of his lord, Tunare, and watching the trapped spirit leave the bones it was imprisoned in. The next statement tore these glamorous thoughts from his mind and made his heart sink until it almost brought him to tears. "It is this evil that took your father, Loral. This isn't a game."</p>

      <p>Though the words happened almost a year ago, they still rang as he stared down the Drybone. The Drybone was physically not much different than the dwarven skeletons he hunted in Butcherblock during his 8th season as a cleric of Tunare. It possessed the same physical vehicle, an ancient decaying skeleton, and had the same lumbering walk as if pulled by a puppeteer. The Drybone was much different though, the spirit inside had gained just enough control to understand it's current status and went insane from it. Sometimes the spirit was a warrior that had made a pact to live forever, only to realize what forever really was, but other times, as in this case, a mage or wizard had made the attempt for immortality themselves with disastrous results. These were the most dangerous types as only lunatic undead wizards would be.</p>

      <p>Loral opened his pack to see the black sockets of his dark totem staring back at him with that evil grin. He pulled the skull out and when his hands touched it, sparks of life appeared in the sockets. This magical skull, a gift from a member of his guild, the Healers United, gave him a surge of energy he could channel into his God's gifts of magic. It always left a sour taste in his mouth when he looked at the ironic icon that gave him this energy while laughing at him in his mind at the same time. Though, as Ciric would say, sometimes in order to defeat your enemy you had to use his power against him. This didn't make Loral feel better about using dark magiks of the Skull of Jhen'ta.</p>

      <p>Loral wanted the battle over quick, so he stood and cast his first spell. The tendrals of roots hundreds of feet under the desert floor thrusted upwards and wrapped around the cracked bones of the Drybone's legs. The drybone struggled against the roots as Loral's eyes went white and the powers of Tunare began to tear the screaming spirit from the bones. The drybone finally managed to turn as the second expulsion began. Loral held the skull of Jen'ta high and cast a third blast. The drybone began its own incantation, finally realizing that it didn't need to move in order to retaliate. Fire burst fourth from it's hands and caused Loral's blood to raise sharply in temperature. Loral grit his teeth from the pain and continued to expulse the undead beast. The Drybone was weakened to the point of destruction but let out a final blast of fire dropping Loral to his knees. Loral dropped the Skull and let out his final expulse, breaking the bones apart and releasing a white light of the trapped spirit that dissipated into the air around him.</p>

      <p>Loral could hardly move but felt the rush of bringing the world one step closer to the land he had known as a boy. His excitement faded as he saw once again the eyes of the magical skull staring back at him, mocking his meager attempt to right what is wrong and reminding him how far he has to go.</p>

      </div>

      <p>A black spike, the size of a spearhead sliced through Loral's dwarven chain and bit into the skin of his shoulder with a single powerful blow. Never had Loral been so viscously hit. The blow knocked him down and slid him against the ground. Apparently, this creature wasn't to happy about him restoring the health of Kormac, the steadfast fighter and a recent friend of Loral, during their battle. A set of black bug like eyes stared at Loral from a beautiful female Tier'Dal face on top of a spiders enlarged body.</p>

      <p>Loral regained his composure and whispered a prayer to Tunare. The wound healed up to just a scratch and he attempted to stand. Before his footing had settled though he fell back down again. There was more to that spike than the initial sting it seemed.</p>

      <p>Loral's vision blurred and the last thing he heard was the sound of the Drachnid's inhuman voice voice chanting dark words as her hands began to glow red. Before the blast hit, Loral fell unconsious from the poison.</p>

      <p>"Poison. That is what Fulgor of the Tusk said when he saw the wood Elven city of Kelethin. It is often the same among the other races and religions. If it does not follow the same path as you, their society is poison." Loral sat in the small and quiet tavern in Felwithe with Ciric Azilebane, his friend and mentor. Loral had just returned from Antonica after his adventures in Ro and was catching up with his old teacher. Loral had described a strange lizard creature, armed and dressed as a fighter, he had seen in the tunnel bazaar a few weeks past. Soon after, Loral learned of the lands of Kunark and the lizard-folk who resided there, the mighty but fallen empire of the Iksars. Loral had told Ciric of his decision to travel to these lands and remove this dangerous menace. Ciric just smiled at this statement and told Loral of the story of Fulgor, the barbarian leader who had told his people of the strange and dangerous wood elves.</p>

      <p>"All creatures of Norrath have a social system, Loral. All believe their society and their deities are the right one. Any threat to that social system is looked upon as dangerous to their way of life. Veeshan has worked a mighty puzzle with all of us and we each have our part to play. While you have the word of Tunare to spread, do not forget that those who oppose it feel just as strongly towards their way of life. Neither is right or wrong."</p>

        <a href="./images/vie.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 62k"><img src="./images/vie_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Elven outpost of Fironia Vie" /></a>

      </div>

      <p>Like all statements coming from Ciric's mouth, this one had Loral thinking all the way from his beloved city of Felwithe to the dark and dangerous lands of Kunark. His excitement seemed to have no bounds as he boarded the mighty Elven vessel that traveled faster than he thought possible to the wonderful outpost in Fironia Vie. The giant statue of Tunare made his heart soar and he stepped off the pier with a new sense of purpose. He was not going to destroy the Iksar menace. He was going to attempt to understand it, learn its culture and its motivation. After all, had Ciric not given him the understanding to treat all of Norrath's creatures individually he never would have sworn himself to Dalhea, the leader of the guild of healers. An alliance he has never questioned.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Loral traveled outside the gates with a party of adventurers like himself and saw the giant millennia old Iksar statue shaking it's fist at the sky as if in defiance of the Gods for bringing their society to it's lowly state. It wasn't one of the fallen Iksars that met him underneath the statue near the mouth of a river that fed into the bay, but the black eyed Drachnid. At first he thought a beautiful naked Tier Dal was coming out of the water to greet them, a site that had him gasping for air all on it's own, but the site of the eight giant legs digging into the earth on both sides of the stream, almost 5 meters apart from each other stunned him even more. The mouth of the cursed creature of Innoruuk opened, revealing the inhumanly sharp teeth. Then the leg tip came in at him.</p>

      <p>"No time for dreaming friend" the lovely barbarian shaman, Desjadins, said as her desease curing potion destroyed the vile ichor that entered his blood. "This battle still needs you".</p>

      <p>Loral stood, feeling as if he had slept for a week to discover his party continuing to battle the vile creature. Aleustria, a powerful and deadly ranger, sliced and slashed the beast along with Kormac's mighty blows until the demon-spawn lay in a pile of cracked shell and blood.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">

      </div>

      <p>The party cheered in victory over the corpse of the vile creature, but an inhuman scream of horror and anger broke their victory cry down as fast as it had started. Above on a hill, a male Drachnid stared at it's fallen mate. His hands raised and clouds of green gas began to seep out of the ground.</p>

      <p>Even these dark creatures had a social system it seemed, and their party had just cut it down without a thought. Now they would have to pay for it.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Loral was hunting the vile Spectral minions of Trakanon's Teeth when he got the word.</p>
      <div class="imageset1"><a href="./images/spectral_keepers.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 68k"><img src="./images/spectral_keepers_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Hunting the Spectral Keepers"  /></a></div>

      <p>"You can go." was all that was said, but those three words changed Loral's life. He would have the ability to represent the Healers United at their first raid on Lord Nagafen, the great red wyrm of Norrath. Since he was a wee lad he had dreamed of facing the dragon, as did every child who ever picked up a wooden sword, but very few ever got the opportunity. Loral, it seemed, would be one of these few.</p>

      <p>He immediately let his group know what was happening and they all rejoiced for him. Being only of the 43rd circle of Tunare meant he was one of the youngest members going. He first was going to have to get to the 44th circle as fast as he can, then begin to collect as much fire protection equipment as he would be able to get.</p>

      <p>Desjardins the long time friend and hunting partner of Loral helped him reach the 44th circle and receive his newest line of spells in a short period of time. Then Azile, the arch-wizard only smiled and shook her head when hearing about the event, then handed Loral a purse of two thousand platinum and sent him on his way to the ever running bazaar of Ro.</p>

     <div class="imageset2"> <a href="./images/nag_raid_mercenaries.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 113k"><img src="./images/nag_raid_mercenaries_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The mercenary war party." /></a></div> 

      <p>Within a matter of hours, Loral was suited up with new armor and stood among some of the roughest and toughest mercenaries in all of Norrath. They had come from all over Norrath, it seemed, to hunt Lord Nagafen. Some came for the promise of riches, some for the thrill of the hunt. Some had experience hunting the great beast before, but all of them were nervous, this they all shared.</p>

      <p>The initial raiding parties were put together and began to march on Nagafen's lair. The three Giant Slayers, mighty warriors who were trained and bred to destroy the nasty Fire Giants that stood in the way of the great beast, headed in first. The other teams went in second. I was picked as the leader of one of these teams.</p>

      <p>The teams began pouring into the entrance to the dragon's lair, slaying the greater Kobolds and heading to the Stone Spider room, a large room about half way to Nagafen's lair. Here we listened to the clashing of steel and the stomping of boots as the giant slayers stormed the front doors of the Fire Giant Citadel. We waited with nervous anticipation, each one of us wondering whether we would be able to slay the beast.</p>

      <p>Then we were called up, the door guards were killed and we could begin to make our way forward. As we moved through the Giants lair, eventually into the throne room of their king, the giant slayers would pull in one or two of the beasts and the groups of soldiers would drop it to the ground. As soon as battle would be engaged, Loral would watch the health of the three warriors, the mage and the bard in his group, but aside from some minor singes, they were never hurt.</p>

     <div class="imageset1"> <a href="./images/magi_rokyl.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 129k"><img src="./images/magi_rokyl_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Battle with Magi Rokyl" /></a></div> 

      <p>Finally, the last giant, a mage named Rokyl, was slain and Wail gave the orders to begin preparing for battle. The groups began to disband, and everyone dropped their preparation spells for the final set to be cast on them. First four weaker protection spells were cast one each member, and then sets of much more powerful protection spells were cast over every member of the group. Once completed, the member would lie down and a magical sleep was laid over them. Once all were ready, all would be awakened simultaneously and the battle would rage.</p>

      <p>An induced dream entered the minds of every soldier in the raid. The orders were implanted into the very sub concous of every man and woman in there. The attack groups were laid out, the plans set fourth. Nagafen would be attacked in two waves. The warrior heavy battle group would be sent in a piece at a time, never giving Nagafen a chance to prepare for the next group. Wizards would blast, druids would call upon the natural surroundings and warriors would hack at the beast until it lies dead.</p>

      <p>Loral was to stay back outside the entrance and heal as it was required of him. He had only one spell needed, a complete heal spell that removed all damage from his party members. He was to cast this on each member as needed until he was able to cast it no more.</p>

      <p>Then the battle horn was called. All the warriors at once were brought back from their sleep. The scared faces now looked like those of a machine, ready to perform their simple operation until they were able to perform it no more. The final groups were put together and the waves were set up.</p>

      <p>With a final silent moment, the raiding party stood outside the stone head that led into the lair of the ancient dragon. Then the order was given.</p>

      <p>"Wave one, charge!"</p>

      <p>With a chorus of shouts, the first team rushed in. Loral and his warriors stood ready for their order. Then it came.</p>

      <p>"Wave two, charge!"</p>
      <div class="imageset2"><a href="./images/Nagafen3.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 107k"><img src="./images/Nagafen3_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Lord Nagafen"  /></a></div> 

      <p>Loral's fighters rushed up the stairs, with Loral in tow, past the corner and into the mouth of the tunnel. Loral got a sight of the dragon, one of the most deadly creatures in all of Norrath, and began preparing his spells. A blast wave like none he had ever seen hit the group, sending Tynulaver to his knees and the others back on their heels. Then a wave of fear hit them. Loral stood aside as a stream of the battlers, unable to control their own movements, ran past him and into the hall behind. Loral began casting his heal on the mortally wounded Tynulaver but it was too late for him, the dragon had him. Loral instead cast on Lindadar, the next warrior in his path. This spell sank in and he was completely healed and ready for another battle. Another prayer left his lips and Lindadar was healed, but soon fell dead a few seconds later.</p>

      <p>Then the terror of the mighty dragon set in. Watching two of his members fall in a matter of seconds, plus a look at the mighty creature was too much for Loral and he felt himself running back into the throne room. Behind him another blast sent people sprawling out into the hall. Loral regained himself and rushed back in to help his comrades, but his mana was spent and he could do nothing but watch as another of his comrades fell. Then a final blast tore the life from Loral's body and dropped him to the floor unconscious.</p>

      <p>Loral awoke in the sleep chamber, only a short ways away from the battle. Two of his party still battled on, and he could still help them. He sat and memorized his complete heal prayer from his book and rushed back into the fray. This time, no fear sunk in and no blast pushed him back out. The mighty dragon was beginning to soften. Loral cast heal after heal until his mana had been depleted. He could do nothing now but watch. Again the piles of bodies forced him into a run back to the safety of the outside hall, but he forced himself back in again.</p>
      <div class="imageset1"><a href="./images/Nagafen_dead2.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 80k"><img src="./images/Nagafen_dead2_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Lord Nagafen lies dead "  /></a> </div>

      <p>Then with a mighty roar, Nagafen fell.</p>

      <p>A hush fell over those remaining. The dragon's enormous body laid out in front of them was almost surreal. Only one of Loral's fighters remained alive. The other four had fallen during the fight. Loral managed to scramble over the body and see the true carnage of the fight. Corpses littered the stairway of the great beast's lair, blood rushed in rivers into the steaming lava on both sides. A group of the survivors was forming inside the main hall of Nagafen's lair. Loral made his way into the room and collapsed. He attempted to search for his friends, Desjardins, who had made it. Nitzerebb, a fellow healer, who had also joined in the hunt was sitting there. They smiled at each other and let their exhaustion take over.</p>
      <div class="imageset2"><a href="./images/victory_party2.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 80k"><img src="./images/victory_party2_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The mercenary war party relaxes in the lair of Nagafen"  /></a> </div>

      <p>The high level clerics worked to help restore life to the fallen bodies. Soon all the original warriors sat in the hall and cheered. Tails of the battle were being sung and written by the bards. Loot was handed out to those lucky enough to receive it. The rest simply enjoyed the moment of serenity in this mouth of darkness. Then groups started to teleport away, led by the druids and wizards of the group. There was another danger of this place. It was very easy in such a crowd to become left behind, unable to escape the clutches of even the now dead wyrm. Luckily an kind soul helped Loral and the remaining members leave the dangerous place and they soon found themselves on the rocks of a druid circle a few kilometers away.</p>

      <p>The battle was a success. Nagafen had fallen.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">66@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Loral was returning from his <a title="The story of Loral's adventures in the desert of Ro" href="ro.html">adventures in the desert of Ro</a> when he heard the horrible news about the <a title="The Harpy's Tavern story of Feronia Vie's abduction" href="http://www.everquest.com/hht/quests/hq_Treachery.jsp">kidnapping of the young maiden, Fironia Vie</a>. While the clerics of the church of Tunare did not answer directly to King Thex of Felwithe, Loral took a personal interest in the return of the Elven princess. Rumor had it that she was <a title="The Harpy's Head story of the origin of Feronia Vie" href="http://www.everquest.com/hht/quests/hq_King.jsp">personally blessed by Tunare</a>, and this fact alone gave Loral the drive to help in her rescue.</p>

      <p>After meeting with his mentor, Ciric, in Felwithe he made the decision to explore Kunark and attempt to find the young maiden. He also wished to learn more of the Iksar people. He had heard of <a title="The Harpy's Head story of the Iksar Traitor" href="http://www.everquest.com/hht/quests/hq_Prisoner.jsp">King Thex's wrath towards the Iksar prisoner</a>, but he personally felt that the king acted rash and that you could not denounce an entire race for the actions of one group.</p>

      <p>Ciric left the city of Felwithe along with Loral and they split up at the docks of Butcherblock. Ciric was returning to the church of light in Quenos to find more information on these new lands while Loral was going to visit the lands himself.</p>
      <div class="imageset1"><a href="./images/keyo_vs_kly.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 62k"><img src="./images/keyo_vs_kly_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Keyo slashes at the spellcasting Kly Imprecator" /></a> </div>

      <p>After an explosive <a title="The story of Loral's first adventure in Kunark" href="vie.html">introduction to Kunark</a>, Loral had many adventures in the land. He spent some time fighting for the newly formed city of Vie (named from the young missing maiden) against the scourge of the nearby giants of the Kromdek. During these times he ran into the occasional Sarnak, a dragon-like creature that stood on two legs and fought like a man. He tracked down a particular faction of these creatures, known as the Kly, to a crypt in the lands of Warslick Woods. Along with his adventuring group he managed to battle his way down through the caverns of this dungeon and meet up with the Kly Imprecator, an ancient Sarnack that had acted as the servant to Dalnir a millennia ago. After a bloody battle with the Kly, Loral discovered a note discussing the young Koada'dal maiden, Feronia Vie, and was signed by the Circle of Scale.</p>
      <div class="imageset2"><a href="./images/veeshan_cave.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 62k"><img src="./images/veeshan_cave_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The lair of the high council of the Circle of Scale" /></a></div> 

      <p>Loral met back up with Ciric in Quenos, after traveling back to the lands of Antonica and learned that the Circle of Scale was an ancient alliance of the greater dragons of Norrath. Some of these great beasts stormed in the open lands of Kunark, but most were secluded in their lairs deep within the earth including a legendary land known as Veeshan's Peaks, where it was rumored the inner lords of the Circle of Scale resided.</p>

      <p>With the help of the leader of Healers United, Dahlea, Loral found himself in a small army that was going to slay the great red dragon, Nagafin. After the epic <a href="nagafen.html">battle against Lord Nagafen</a>, Loral found little to help discover the location of Feronia, except to hear of another land, undiscovered in thousands of years known as Velious. A land still ruled by the great dragons and giants that made their homes there in the beginning of time.</p>
      <div class="imageset1"><a href="./images/vox_attack.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 72k"><img src="./images/vox_attack_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Lady Vox Attacks" /></a></div> 

      <p>Shortly thereafter, Loral was asked to join a raiding party who would be going after Lady Vox, Nagafen's mate. While the war party Loral joined had no problem battling the goblins who had moved into the fortress of Permafrost a millennia ago, and even defeated the Ice Giants who protected Vox, treachery was afoot.</p>

      <p>The priest of Nagafin, a fire giant emissary of the red dragon had warned Lady Vox of the impending attack and she was prepared. She froze half the soldiers with her icy breath upon entering the great cavern and those that remained standing ran in sheer terror from the beast. Her giant guards who had stood in wait pounced on the fleeing warriors and crushed them with boulder, feet and fists. Loral managed to escape along with a few others from the ambush and later helped to heal the wounded who made it out. Wizards and druids helped those trapped in the icy caverns to escape from the clutches of the giants. Vox laughed her horrible icy laugh as the party scrambled away.</p>

      <p>Loral continued his exploration of Kunark, searching for more information on the Circle of Scale, and the mysterious lich-king of Kunark, <a title="The lich king of the Iksar's, Venril Sather" href="http://www.everquest.com/hht/quests/hq_Plan.jsp">Venril Sather</a> who's name is whispered by the dying Lycanthrope's outside of Karnor's Castle, where Loral currently hunts.</p>

      <title>Chapter 5: The War of Fear</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">67@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>While successfully holding back the minions of Unrest from invading all of the Faydark, the Healers United took many casualties. Seeing his friends fall to the minions of Cazic Thule sent Loral into a rage. He traveled back to his home of Felwithe, but the demons followed him, if only in his mind.</p>

      <p>Then opportunity presented itself to strike back. A long time friend of Loral from his hunts in the lands of Kunark, Dinirose the Enchanter, sent word that they were amassing a force from the highest guilds in the land to counterattack Cazic Thule in his homeworld, the Plane of Fear.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/hate_gate.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 68k"><img src="./images/hate_gate_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The dark doorway into the plane of Fear" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral traveled to the dark swamps of the Feerott, where the rumored portal to Fear existed. After tracking a specter's roar through a wall in the mountain, Loral found the cave. The catacombs in the mountain almost did Loral in, as the specters scythe slashed at him while he ran aimlessly into the cave. Then around a corner like many hundreds before it, Loral faced the portal.</p>

      <p>Dinirose and a black robed necromancer stood by the portal. Icebone skeletons surrounded the portal but left the party alone, as if inviting them to step inside the portal and greet Cazic Thule himself.</p>

      <p>Loral's fear almost overtook him, but the images of his friends being cut down by Thule's minions started his heart afire again. He stepped up on the stairwell that lead to the portal and after whispering a last prayer to Tunare, he stepped inside.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/raining_blood.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 99k"><img src="./images/raining_blood_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The skys will rain with the blood of mortals" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>The blood red sky burned Loral's eyes as he stepped out of the fiery portal. The land stretched in front of him, covered with horribly twisted trees and scorched earth. His small party had already traveled ahead of him, so he ran to catch up, but the vile denizens of this cursed place caught up with him first. The stinging cold of some white spider-like creature hit him like a crashing wave. Along with it came two red demons, who bit and clawed at him. Loral fell to his knees before their savagery. He was unprepared for such creatures and fell quickly. Blackness surrounded him.</p>

      <p>It was not the beautiful face of Tunare that his eyes laid upon when he awoke, but that of Dinirose. A dwarven cleric had returned his soul to his body and he stood up once again, weakened and disoriented. The red sky was still above him, but now he felt a wetness falling on him from it. It seemed too warm and thick to simply be rain and he was horrified when he saw the blood streaming down his armor.</p>

      <p>Apparently his companions had found the raiding party and had dragged his corpse along with them. The dwarven cleric called upon his own gods to restore Loral, and they began preparing for the small war against Cazic Thule's minions.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/amygdalan_knight.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 178k"><img src="./images/amygdalan_knight_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Amygdalan Knight, the personal guards of Cazic Thule" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Vile creatures so unnatural they never would walk the earth of the prime material plane slashed and blasted at the war party. Minions of Thule that Loral had only heard about from Ciric, his mentor, or had seen in ancient tomes written back in the days the Ring of Scale ruled the Norrath. Some demons as small as goblins or fire beetles fought with the fury of giants or wurms. Mutated apes and towering ghouls all clawed against the earth in search of the blood of mortals. The giant squid headed Amygdalons, the elite guard of Cazic Thule offered the most resistance, blasting with poison clouds and cutting with viscous claws. They soon fell to the party, though, with limited casualties.</p>

      <p>For days, the party traveled across the dark vile lands, slaying demons and hell-spawn with no mercy. Many priests from many gods traveled with them, and Loral had found himself spending more time blasting down the demon-kin than he did healing. Only occasionally would one of the vile creatures slay one of the warparty, but a quick prayer to Tunare would restore them to this world.</p>

      <p>The holy war lasted two weeks, but finally it was apparent that they could not stay in this land forever and Cazic Thule himself was not to be found. Loral bade his friends goodbye and gated himself back to the lands of Kunark. While the walls of the ancient Iksar castle were far from the warmth of his bed in Felwithe, seeing a blue sky again was enough for Loral to realize what home really meant to him.</p>

<p>Loral was enraged by the <a href="scale.html" title="Loral and the Circle of Scale">loss at the hands of Lady Vox</a>. Watching his friends crushed and clawed like ants was more than his mind could take. He vowed to find what lead to this treachery and destroy it. He would help rescue Fironia Vie and avenge the deaths of the heroes he fought along.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/dead_sarnak.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 57k"><img src="./images/dead_sarnak_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral over the dead Sarnak" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Months later, while assisting in the war against the Kromdek, great giants who battled the Antonican armies, Loral found a clue. A Sarnak knight had struck at Loral's party and was quickly cut down by the blades of Shagnaz, the ranger, a long time friend of Loral. On his body they found a note signed by the circle of scale. Loral gave the note to Dinirose, Shagnaz' wife, a highly skilled enchanter and expert of dragon lore. She translated the note for Loral.</p>

      <p>The note was from the Chancellor of Di'Zok to his lord. It stated that the circle of scale gave a reward to the lord for his help in protecting Lady Vox. This reward was in the possession of the Chancellor and he would be expecting Di'Zok's gate commander, Korasal Klyseer, to come and pick up the key. Loral had heard stories of this commander, a shadowknight who delighted in reanimating his victims and using them to fight for him later.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/sarnak_fort.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 57k"><img src="./images/sarnak_fort_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Sarnak fort in Lake of Ill Omen" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral had no intention of it ever being retrieved. He traveled back to the Lake of Ill Omen, a land he had traveled when first coming to Kunark. The young warriors of the Elven outpost continued their battles with the Sarnak at a fort deep within the area. Loral met up with the armies of Vie and found out that a small infiltration team had made it inside the fort but had been routed within. They were trapped inside the Chancellor's dining hall. Loral asked a near by wizard to cast the spell of invisibility on him and he slipped past the guards near the rear of the complex.</p>

      <p>When inside, he heard the snarls of the beasts all around him. They passed him by in groups of three or four all heading to the outskirts of the fort where the battles raged on. Loral continued deeper within the fort until a Sarnak spellcaster, an extremist, sensed his presence. As soon as Loral heard the familiar chant of the Sarnak he countered with a wave of power that blew the spellcaster on his back. Another chant to Tunare drew roots through the stone floor and immobilized the unconscious beast. Loral open his hands and prayed to Tunare to release her wrath on the creature and a ball of magical energy blew the Sarnak into pieces. Loral smiled at his own power, noting how often he had to battle with such beasts with far less desirable outcomes.</p>

      <p>Loral continued into the Chancellor's dining hall, sliding past those Sarnak legionnaires and recruits who guarded the place. Inside he found the small band of adventurers that had been trapped within. He healed and cast magical protections on the party who began their preparations to escape the room. As they finalized their preparations to leave, the Chancellor stepped into the hall.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">

      </div>

      <p>The Chancellor of Di'Zok was physically large for his race, standing at almost two and a half meters. A spiritual wolf walked in with him, it's Grey eyes hollow and lifeless. In his hand he carried a massive spear inlaid with jade runes that glowed with a magical light.</p>

      <p>Loral wasted no time. The band had already cleared out the Sarnak guards who the Chancellor had expected to protect him, so their time to strike was at hand. Loral called a wave of force, which slammed the Chancellor hard. The Chancellor was not as easily defeated as the extremist Loral had battled earlier, but the stunning blow still slowed him down. Loral, hit him with the retribution of Tunare. While the damage was mighty, the large Sarnak took it in stride. The Chancellor's wolf started charging at Loral, running at inhuman speeds. Loral expected the dog to knock him down and probably begin to tear him apart. He gritted his teeth and took comfort in the fact that he would die in the name of Tunare and Felwithe, when the armored barbarian, Tinyfeet, slammed the wolf with his shield, sending it sprawling just before it hit Loral. Loral ignored the cries of the wolf as the party cut and blasted it down, concentrating on calling spell after spell upon the Chancellor. The Chancellor's own majiks were mighty even without his wolf companion and Loral felt the sting of electricity soar through his armor and into his bones. Loral stood his ground through the onslaught of spells and finally the Chancellor fell to the ground dead, smoke rising from his eyes and mouth.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/loral_in_rain.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 31k"><img src="./images/loral_in_rain_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral in rain" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral whispered a prayer to Tunare and his wounds faded away. He walked over to the smoldering corpse and picked up the jade spear. The party finished off the wolf and cheered at each other and at Loral. Loral only looked at the spear and wondered whether this was the reward that cost the lives of so many.</p>

      <p>After regrouping and preparing for their escape, the party made it's way back out into the sunlight and into the ranks of the army of Vie. Unlike the rest of the party, Loral found little comfort in their escape. Instead he found his rage building even more, telling him to travel to Chardok and give this necromancer the reward he so richly deserved. Loral ate silently before his journeys, imagining what rewards he would give the shadowknight, Klyseer, for the deaths of his friends</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>After his <a href="dizok.html" title="Loral battles the Chancellor of Di'Zok">battles at the Sarnak fortress</a>, Loral returned to the Elven outpost of Fironia Vie. A cool breeze smelling of the salt from Timorous Deep lulled him to sleep under the statue of Tunare. Fully refreshed the next morning, loral visited the local cleric's guild and received a message from a young page. The message was short but hit Loral like a hammer. Ciric, Loral's mentor, was in trouble. Loral immediately booked passage back to Faydwer to help his old friend.</p>

      <p>It took Loral far to long to locate his mentor, who apparently was visiting the temples in Quenos. By the time he reached the human city of Freeport it was too late for him to continue his travels. Luckily, Brianna, a member of Healers United was able to travel to Quenos in Loral's stead and save Ciric just in the nick of time. The vile Tier'Dal had hired an assassin to murder Ciric as he helped the young warriors of Quenos clean up the rats, bats and snakes that plagued the front gates. Ciric received Brianna's warning just in time to defeat the assassin and discover his origin.</p>

      <p>Brianna returned the message to Loral of the safety of his mentor and while he was surly relieved to know his friend lived, it did little to ease his heart. Ciric had been specifically targeted by the Tier'Dal, and while this attempt had not succeeded, Loral might not learn of the next.</p>

      <p>A note found on the assassin was signed by General V'Ghera, the field commander of the Tier'Dal armies. According to the Elven war commanders in Felwithe, General V'Ghera was leading the Tier'Dal against the human outpost of High Keep.</p>

      <p>Tier'Dal necromancers and dark clerics had raised the dead of ancient armies from a long forgotten war buried deep under the Kithicor forest to fight for them. The undead attacks on High Keep had been raging for a year, but the Tier'Dal only sent in their undead minions at night, clawing their way out of the cursed grounds at dusk and returning to their graves in the mourn.</p>

      <p>Loral had learned that the General himself had recently traveled to Kithicor along with his personal lieutenants, priests and spellcasters. He would be taking a personal interest in the fall of High Keep. As part of his plans, he sent out his circle of assassins across all of Norrath to eliminate those who opposed him. Great military leaders from the human, elven and even barbarian nations were killed as they slept or ate in their homes. This is how enough came into danger. The General felt that Ciric's assistance to the human armies of Quenos was enough to sign his death warrant. And upon learning of the failure, it would certainly invoke a stronger attack later.</p>

      <p>The decision for Loral was not difficult. For the horrors they inflicted on the dead of Kithicor, the constant murder of High Keep's citizens and the attack upon his mentor, Loral declared his own personal war against the General and his army.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/tierdal_camp.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 68k"><img src="./images/tierdal_camp_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Tier'Dal camp" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral traveled quickly to Kithicor with the help of the druids in his guild. Many of the battle groups around High Keep spent their time defending the keep from the undead armies, but a small team was being put together with the intent of inhabitants the dark elven camp which resided in a burned out cabin. Loral didn't wish to think about what happened to the original inhabitants. He asked to join this raiding party, offering his powers as a cleric of Tunare.</p>

      <p>The infiltration team was lead by a rogue named Wyen. Loral thought him to be a half elf, but almost every time Loral layed eyes on him, he had shifted into some other race whether it be gnome, or even dark elf. Loral had no idea what race Wyen really was, perhaps he was simply a shadow. While his origin may undetermined, his ability to command the small group into a single fighting entity was not questioned. The party traveled from the canyon entrance of High Keep into the deep wood of Kithicor. During the day, the band found no troubles, but at night, the undead shrieked and lumbered around them. Many of the horrid beasts rushed in to attack the group but found themselves blasted down with spells and steel.</p>

      <p>On the second night, one of these vile creatures rushed out of the dark woods and attacked Loral personally. It was a ghoulish creature, hunched over with yellow eyes, but even after centuries under the ground, Loral could still tell that this fearsome beast was once a high elf. The ghoul swung on Loral with a dark morningstar, which tore into Loral's robes. The beast swung again, catching Loral in the side. Loral heard the cracking of his ribs, but the pain hadn't hit him yet. Loral whispered a chant and the ghast's eyes were filled with the horror of his own existence. As the beast fled into the woods, Loral called the earth to rise and hold the undead elf in place. Loral called another set of prayers that drew out the dark forces which animated the husk of this poor soul. It fell to the ground in a heap.</p>

      <p>Loral couldn't move. His ribs had torn up his internal organs and he was slowly bleeding to death. A dwarven cleric noticed Loral's state and was quick to call upon her own diety to heal Loral's wounds and mend the broken bones. Freshly healed, he then examined the corpse and what he found made him weep. Not only was this horror once a high elf, but a high elven cleric of Tunare. The symbol around his neck had only one meaning and apparently even Tunare's blessing could not stop the Tier'Dal from using his corpse against her.</p>

      <p>The dark morning star lay at the beasts feet, a blue-black glow around it. Loral picked it up. The first feeling he got was the sheer weight of the thing. Even though it was not large in sized, it felt as heavy as a giants axe. That feeling was quickly forgotten as the warmth and strength of the weapon flowed into him. Hazy visions of the wars of the past filled his head. Ancient battles with dragons and giants, ceremonies between the high elves and the wood elves and finally the darkness and hate of being driven from the earth. All of these visions hit Loral in a matter of seconds, and quickly they were gone. Only the warmth and comfortable vibration of the weapon remained.</p>

      <p>The next day passed and Wyen began giving orders to the team, forming into small battle groups. A few hours later, Wyen's personal group left to pull the General and his escort into the trap they prepared.</p>

      <p>One of the wizards in the group had used his magic to view through the eyes of Wyen. As soon as the trap was sprung, he yelled out to the rest of the group to get ready. Within moments, Wyen had returned with the Tier'Dal commanders behind him.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/adjutant.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 68k"><img src="./images/adjutant_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Adjutant D'Kan" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Even after realizing the trap, the General and his party fought like wild animals. Adjutant D'Kan, one of the General's master assassins wielding two magical scimitars, cut through the teams like an entire army. His blades twisted and sliced into the joints in armor and into the soft skin beneath. Four great and mighty warriors dropped to his blades in a matter of seconds. Only the icy blasts of a team of wizards froze him in place and pummeled him to the ground. One of the Tier'Dal wizards draped waves of magical fire over the casters, searing their flesh. But she was quickly slammed by the shield of a huge barbarian warrior and cut down with his blade.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/general1.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 68k"><img src="./images/general1_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="General V'Ghera" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>The General himself fought like no other warrior Loral had ever seen. He did not rush in, taking his time to judge his opponent. When someone charged in, he deflected the blow easily with his shield, not taking the brunt of the attack but letting it roll off. The his sword would cut in perfectly, dropping this opponents like training dummies. The casters spells made few marks on him, as if the protection of Innoruuk kept their spells at bay.</p>

      <p>Warm waves traveled from Loral's hands to the damaged fighters, closing up wounds and soothing burns. The General saw that with the healing powers of the clerics behind them, the warriors would eventually cut him down. He vaulted over a charging ranger and sliced into the line of healers. Two of them fell to the ground faster than Loral had ever seen. The General's eyes fixed on Loral's and he smiled stepping casually over the corpses he left in his wake. Loral whispered his final prayer to Tunare and waited for the blade of the General to run him through. Suddenly the General stopped. He looked down at the morning star in Loral's hand and smiled a little. Then his sword fell to the ground and he collapsed. Loral was confused, looking at the morning star. Then he saw the large wound that ran from the shoulder down to his right hip in the Generals back. Wyen appeared out of the darkness behind him and smiled. His curved blade was red with the lifeblood of the General.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/dead_general.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 68k"><img src="./images/dead_general_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Dead General" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>What remained of the war party cheered in their victory. Loral returned the lives of the fallen clerics who in turn returned the lives of the other fallen adventurers. In time they returned in victory to High Keep.</p>

      <p>The undead still plagued the forest, but this time in disarray instead as an organized party. Loral had nightmares of their torment, forced to fight in a never ending war instead of sleeping in the rest they so richly deserved. Still, High Keep was once again protected and Ciric was safe from the clutches of General V'Ghera. Still a dark voice spoke to Loral, reminding him of the battles he had yet to fight. Feeding him the visions of the Maestro of Rancor stealing his father into Hate. Of the slaughter of so many noble warriors. The kidnapping of Tunare's daughter. These dark images kept him from spending the time resting in Felwithe that he planned and he soon left to venture back into battle.</p>

<p>It had been a week since Loral assisted in the <a href="kithicor.html" title="Loral's battle with General V'Ghera">battles with General V'Ghera</a> and his minions. Azile had convinced Loral to spend a few days resting in Felwithe before returning back to his war against the Ring of Scale. The return home had partially served its purpose, Loral was rested, but far from relaxed.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/tavern.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 117k"><img src="./images/tavern_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The tavern above Loral's apartment in Tunare" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral pulled the large locked chest out from underneath the bed in his small apartment. He opened the chest and milled around the contents, not really sure what he was looking for. He pushed aside his golden armor, rewards from the temple of Solsek Ro. A layer of dust had accumulated on it since he packed it away. He now wore a much lighter Jarsath scale armor he found on Venril Sather's undead minions in Karnor's Castle. Many of his traveling possessions had been replaced with more practical items. More practical in battle. The priests of Tunare frowned on this, but they never faced the beasts Loral had killed.</p>

      <p>Then he saw what he had apparently been looking for. <a href="ro.html" title="Loral and the Skull in the desert of Ro">The dusty skull smiled at him once again</a>, the grin making Loral's heart sink. He had thought the item lost, or sold on one of his many trips to the Oasis bazaar, but there it was. Seeing the skull gave Loral an introspective view of his life. In his recent days, battling for the freedom of the Elven nations and the word of Tunare, all he had seen was death. The very city he grew up in seemed foreign compared to the battlefield of the Dreadlands. The stink and blood of hundreds of creatures replaced the pristine robes he used to wear. While he often reminded himself that he was the hand of Tunare, the black empty eyes of the skull showed him the raw truth. He was not her hand, he was her fist.</p>

      <p>That night nightmares raked through his sleep. Thousands of years ago a mighty city of the Iksars was destroyed because of the treachery of one of their leaders. While the citizens led their normal daily lives, no different than those of Felwithe, one of their elders made a pact with demons for nothing other than personal gain. The pact led to the death of all of the men, women and children of the city and it became lost for a millennia. Their spirits still roamed the city, unable to rest after the demons raised them from the earth. This traitor still ruled over the city, far above in his tower while the innocent cry for their loss below.</p>

      <p>Loral woke staring at the dark battleworn mace he had picked up in Kithicor. The screams of children as they are torn apart by black demons echoed through his head while he looked at the dull gray aura that surrounded it. Once again Tunare sent him on a mission. He must find this lost city and avenge the deaths of so many innocents.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/kunark_statues.jpg"><img src="./images/kunark_statues_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The ancient society of the Iksar" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>His years in Kunark gave Loral a keen knowledge of many of the lost monuments to the Iksar's past. It was not long before he found the city, following the rumors and lore of those he fought with. He even had discovered a group of adventurers also seeking the lost city. There he reunited with his friend, Desjardins, the barbarian shaman. Together they traveled via spell and by foot through the overgrown Emerald Jungle and to the entrance of the city.</p>

      <p>Thousands of years ago it had been a mighty city. Giant Iksar statues adorned every pillar, guarding the gates with their stone blades. Inside the city, a feeling of gloom touched the hearts of the adventurers. A true horror had been unleashed here, there was no doubt.</p>

      <p>Upon entering the city, they were immediately attacked by the ghosts of long dead Iksar. Their icy touch sought to tear the life from the adventurers, but the adventurers were strong. Magical blades and powerful spells tore the spirits to ethereal shreds. Huge lumbering golems, magical creations by some powerful wizards slammed into the warriors' line of defense sending them sprawling. Only the mightiest casters could blast their clay bodies down.</p>

      <p>Further into the city they crept. Past the inns, merchant shops and houses of the dead until they reached a courtyard. Here they established a battle camp. Scouts would enter further and draw out the horrors that laid within.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/black_reaver.jpg"><img src="./images/black_reaver_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The ancient society of the Iksar" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>These horrors came in the shape of giant black constructions, called Black Reavers. Their armored skin so black and lifeless that spells were simply absorbed into it. No eyes stared at the adventures and no sound aside from the slamming of unearthly metal could be heard from within the depths of their skin. The casters switched to increasing the strength and protection of their warriors who cut, slashed and bashed the beasts until they fell, one right after another. Upon cutting down the last one, a spirit of an ancient wizard was released from within the black vessel and rained fire upon the party before being destroyed by the mighty adventurers.</p>

      <p>The adventures fought their way into a keep near the back of the city battling the unholy Reavers along the way. Inside, they discovered a hidden corridor that led to magical translucent ramps. These ramps took the adventurers up into the sky above the city. Houses and great halls floated above, held up by ancient and powerful magics.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/tower.jpg"><img src="./images/tower_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The tower above the city." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Upon entering one of these halls, the party was ambushed by a team of undead warriors and casters. The lord they sought was apparently aware of their presence. The battle raged for an hour with both groups using magic to bring back their fallen heroes and unleashing the powers of gods upon each other. With nearly total losses, the adventures were finally victorious, cursing the last wrath that stood in their way.</p>

      <p>After bringing back their dead, the party continued, walking carefully along the pathways that spanned a kilometer above the city below. Finally they reached the lord's tower. It stood untouched and silent ready to unleash hell upon the heroes. A thief of the party went in to draw out the lord and within seconds, they were attacked by another fist of Reavers. Each one fought with the force of an army and did so completely without emotion. They were simply constructions built for death. Loral felt a chill through him when this thought crossed his mind. When the final one fell, Neh'Ashiir, the traitor, raised from the remains of the armored hulk. The party felt a new rush, facing this demon and unleashed all they had. The lord rained poison and fire upon them, dropping many a strong warrior. Wizard's spells were interrupted with a choking cloud of noxious gas. Loral feared they would lose. Then the magical blades of a dozen fighters cut deep into him and Neh'Ashiir fell.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/ashiir.jpg"><img src="./images/ashiir_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Ashiir the traitor" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral stepped over to the fallen specter, wishing to see the face of such a horrid creature. What he saw made him stop short. The face was of an old wrinkled Iksar, nothing more. His eyes were gray and sad, no hate could be seen in them. Loral could still feel the sting of the creature's spells, but he felt no hate. Neh'Ashiir was as much a pawn to the dark forces of Norrath as anyone. Loral felt tears come to his eyes.</p>

      <p>The rest of the adventurers split the treasure of the tower with one another. Ancient artifacts of a long lost culture were given to the mightiest adventurers. They quickly regrouped and made the decision to continue the battle against the undead of this scarred city. Loral no longer wished to continue the battle, he had seen enough pain. He bade his friends good will and returned to his home. His home along the scorched earth of the Dreadlands.</p>

<p>Loral was surrounded by the dark ones. Unholy priests, beasts of nightmares and the walking dead of ancients stared at the Kaoa'Dal Cleric. While any one of these beasts could have slain Loral in seconds, it was not them he was afraid of, or even paying attention to.</p>

      <p>The lord of Hate, father of lies, god of demons stood in front of Loral, towering over him. He was flanked by the slayer of Loral's father, the Maestro of Rancor, and a charred construction that resembled a female dark elf brandishing the tools of a torturer. Lord Innoruuk smiled at Loral as if welcoming an old friend.</p>

      <p>"You have grown mighty, young one. Who would have thought that the simple act of retrieving my hammer could have created such a power as I feel in you." Loral could feel the mockery pouring threw him with every word. "I see you have tossed aside those dry tomes of yours and now brandish a weapon, what a sadness that must be to your Lady, Tunare."</p>

      <p>"It is a weapon of my people, Demon. It was wielded by an ancient priest against your minions a thousand years ago. It's name is Kathalo'r. It has slain your children and now it will slay you." Loral said swinging the black battleworn morning star back from underneath his cloak.</p>

      <p>"I too have a weapon, young one." Innoruuk spoke, lifting an identical black mourning star into Loral's gaze. As Loral stared into the eternal blackness of the weapon, he felt himself waking from this horrible dream. When his eyes opened, the final words echoed throughout his mind.</p>

      <p>"It is called Loral"</p>

      <p>Twelve dark robed figures stood in the large room. One stood near the center, his hood pulled back exposing his scaled head and dark red eyes. He turned to the rest, taking each of the other eleven in his gaze. No words were spoken and none needed to be. The voices of the eleven fill his head, and he responded with thoughts of his own. These twelve were the only hope of keeping Sebilis, the greatest city of the Iksar, from falling to the beast of nightmares. The unhooded figure hissed at them one final time ceasing their conversation and raised his hands. Suddenly, the twelve appeared a mile under the earth in the cavern that the creature called home. This was the outpost where the Froglok warriors and sorcerers had poured out and devastated the entire city. The twelve turned around and faced the beast. They called the energy of the planes to their grasp twisting and forming it into a single beam capable of destroying a city. The beam turned rivers into steam and rock into glass. It struck the beast in his massive green chest, scorching a hole through the thick skin, through his scarred ribcage and past the cavity that should have contained his vital organs. Trakanon laughed and seconds later the sorcerers died. The mightiest empire Kunark had ever known was lost forever.</p>

      <p>Two thousand years later, Loral Ciriclight, Vicar of Tunare, stood just a few meters from where the Iksar sorcerers had died. He and his war party stood at the foot of a narrow, rotting bridge that led into the undead dragon's cavern. Loral had prepared his group with spells of protection from Trakanon's deadly breath and fierce attacks, but he feared these would be little protection against the ancient wurm. Still his group was ready to do battle.</p>
      
<div class="imageset2"><a href="./images/sebilis_statues.jpg" title="The statues of Sebilis, jpeg image 1024x768 106k"><img src="./images/sebilis_statues_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The statues of Sebilis, jpeg image 1024x768 106k" /></a></div>

      <p>Months he had spent in the swamps and jungles of Kunark, seeking the ancient ruins of the once mighty city. Finally he had found it, deep in the jungle of Trakanon's Teeth. A huge stone archway led to rows of enormous Iksar statues guarding the walkway. Loral found a cavern inside one of the outlying buildings that led deep under the city. The corridor winded hundreds of feet underground until it ended in a large room. In the center, a huge ruby orb bathed the room with a brilliant red light. Only the idol of Trakanon, an ancient key of an ancient time, would allow passage into the depths of Sebilis. Loral had one such idol.</p>

      <p>Now Loral faced that small rotten bridge, knowing that death sat on the other side. They had little problems with the Froglok guards. Deeper within the caverns they defeated the Sebilite Juggernaughts and Trakanon's personal guard, the Sebilite Protector. They reformed their attack groups and now waited for the orders to charge. After what seemed like an eternity, the order came.</p>

      <div class="imageset1"><a href="./images/trak1.jpg" title="Trakanon, beast of nightmares, jpeg image 1024x768 175k"><img src="./images/trak1_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Trakanon, beast of nightmares, jpeg image 1024x768 175k"  /></a></div>

      <p>Loral's group was the first to charge in. They turned the corner and faced the beast. Trakanon smiled at them. He raised his head hundreds of feet into the air and swept his hollow eyes across the group, then they fixed upon Loral. The warriors and rangers immediately began slashing at the dragon, cutting into his thick, rotten skin. But Loral was transfixed with the beast's eyes. Tiny specks of intense light pierced into Loral from the dark caverns where apparently Trakanon once had eyes. Unlike the other dragons Loral had faced, he felt no fear. Instead he felt something he truly didn't expect to feel. The beasts pain.</p>

      <p>Time slowed down. The room went silent. Loral stood, his battleworn mace hanging at his side, while his group charged in. Trakanon's gaze didn't move from Loral's. A millennia of isolation, the horror of living in death, the pain of existing for thousands of years as a rotting corpse. All of these hit Loral like waves of ice. Then with the boom of a wizards blast, time sped back up. Trakanon's gaze shifted off of Loral and he returned to the battle at hand.</p>
      <div class="imageset2"><a href="./images/trak3.jpg" title="Trakanon, the undead dragon of Sebilis, jpeg image 1024x768 189k"><img src="./images/trak3_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Trakanon, the undead dragon of Sebilis, jpeg image 1024x768 189k"  /></a></div>

      <p>Trakanon lifted his head and breathed his poison breath on the war party. Spells were choked off and mighty warriors fell to their knees under the thick stench of death. Loral opened up his heart to Tunare and began releasing her healing energy into the warriors of his group. Tendrils of swirling light faded away the burns of corrosion the poison left on the mighty warriors, but the taint had sunk in. Loral felt his own life-force fading under the vile poison. He drained every ounce of spiritual energy he had, giving it to himself and his party. Still the poison tore at them from the inside of their lungs and from within their blood. Soon the heroes began falling to the plague that engulfed them. Loral took a final look at the battle as his legs became weak. Half the warriors fell like timber, the other half slashed and blasted with every last ounce they had in them. Then blackness overtook Loral's vision and he collapsed to the ground.</p>

      <p>"What has happened to you Loral, what happened to the wide eyed acolyte ready to spread the word of Tunare with peace and love?" Ciric Azilebane sat at the small tavern in Quenos across from Loral. Loral had just related the <a href="kithicor.html">story of General V'Ghera</a> to Ciric who did not seem impressed with the killing of the General and his minions. "You left the gates of Felwithe wearing a priest's robes and carrying the Testament of Vanear. Now you wear the blood of your enemies like some dark badge of honor. Even the high priests of Tunare don't approve of your actions anymore, most fear you to much to tell you. Your books of scripture and history have been replaced with a burnt shield and that black mace."</p>

      <p>"Enough!" Loral stood, his chair falling backwards onto the floor. The tavern went silent. "Those fools in Felwithe have no idea what they speak of. They wish to spread the word of Tunare, hoping it's mere speaking will turn all the world's evil away. Even you believe you can make a difference, giving your protection to the hunters of rats and snakes. We are at war, Ciric. Evil pours out of the earth from every cave, every hole and every swamp of this world. Once peaceful woods are now haunted by powerful armies of undead right outside our door. You can hide behind your robes and your scripture and close your eyes, but I cannot. Beasts you can't even imagine will crawl past these walls and kill our children if we don't do something about it. And I will." Loral got up and left the bar. It was the first time he had ever had a conversation like that with Ciric and it broke his heart. He gritted his teeth against the tears and started his preparations to go back to Kunark.</p>

      <p>The memory faded as warmth flowed through Loral's veins. His eyes opened to the plump face of a female dwarven cleric. She smiled warmly at him, stood up and walked to the next corpse. Loral got to his feet, still very weak from the resurrection, and looked around. Trakanon's corpse filled the hall. Small bands of the survivors sat and regained their strength as clerics walked from group to group, putting their hands on their wounds. Loral walked over to the enormous corpse.</p>
      <div class="imageset1"><a href="./images/trakanon_corpse.jpg" title="The corpse of Trakanon jpeg image 1024x768 173k"><img src="./images/trakanon_corpse_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The corpse of Trakanon jpeg image 1024x768 173k" /></a></div>

      <p>The fire still burned in Trakanon's eyes, but they focused on nothing. Adventurers wandered around the corpse looking at the wounds of a thousand battles. Loral reached into the jaw of the giant beast and tore free one of the dagger sized teeth. He pulled off the red wurm scale he wore around his neck, and hung the tooth there in its place. Then, whispering a prayer to Tunare, he left. The ancient horror of Sebilis, destroyer of a nation, Trakanon, had fallen.</p>

      <p>Deep in the bowels of his dark citadel, under the eternally black sky and air filled with the screams of innocence, Innoruuk laughed. He sat on his throne, staring into the fire that burned from the broken bones of Elven clerics and druids, now crushed under Innoruuk's hand. In it he saw Loral tie the dragon tooth around his neck. Behind Innoruuk stood a dark cleric, dressed completely in blackened charred armor, his face pale and featureless. Innoruuk turned and gazed at his minion, who stood ready to serve. "Soon we will be ready, my friend, and then you can have him."</p>

      </div>

      <p>Korasal Klyseer had been in the services of the Di'Zok Royals for over a century. He enjoyed his position as the commander of the Di'Zok troops stationed outside Chardok and was proud to offer his protection. This latest news he received, of the possible <a href="dizok.html" title="Loral's battle with the Chancellor of Di'Zok">betrayal and death of the Overking's Chancellor</a> was not good news. He awaited a message from the outpost by the Lake of Ill Omen on the situation. He received it in the form of fire as it exploded from the ground around him, immediately followed by the sting of two arrows as they entered his chest. His skeletal minion rushed to meet the forces, but was torn to pieces by a white spiritual ball of light. A burly fighter in bronzed armor rushed up to fight Korasal face to face. Korasal touched him and felt the energy of the fighters onslaught seep out of him. The Klyseer quickly cut him down with a stroke from his blade, the Runic Carver. His victory became small when wolves burst out of the trees and tore into his legs, taking him to the ground. Two more cuts from the blades of a ranger had him gasping for one last breath. He turned and looked into the blue rage filled eyes of Loral Ciriclight.</p>

      <p>"Your chancellor sends you a message." Loral said before smashing the 200 year old dark knight's head open with the battleworn morningstar of Kelethin.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Prince Selrach Di'Zok was discussing the latest plans of his father and mother to increase the forces around the goblin strongholds near the Frontier with his advisors, when the front door to their keep came smashing down with the fists of a huge elemental. His advisors, both skilled sorcerers, immediately began chanting their spells of protection while the Prince unleashed his own dark magics, tearing the elemental into chunks of dirt. The mercenary battle group that laid siege to the keep began pouring in, cutting with the might of an army and casting arcane spells only spoken by the mightiest sorcerers in Norrath. Fires burned and ice blasted from both sides in the battle. Cuts deep enough to slay the mightiest fighters were healed before they bled. After seconds that seemed like hours, the sorcerer advisors of the prince stood captivated, unable to move under the magical whispers of enchanters, while the prince was slain and beheaded. Loral picked up the head and set it on a red velvet chair who's cost could feed the city of Felwithe for a year. Let that be the first thing the Overking sees when he returns, he thought.</p>

      </div>

      <p>The ancient books of the the Iksar describe the last days of Venril Sather's role as the emperor of their people. They describe his reign of terror as he ruled all of Kunark with an iron fist. They speak of his love for another practitioner of his dark art, the Necromancer Druzilla. With her he found his only true happiness, and it was shortly taken from him when she was assassinated by those in his senate who opposed him. His rage was felt by every living thing on the continent. His most loyal servants were sealed in the tomb of his beloved, cursed to live forever screaming within the mountain city of Charisis. Before he went into seclusion, he gave the key to the tomb to the only servant he could trust. His spy within the Chardok empire, Xalgoz the Vampire. Children were threatened with a visit from Xalgoz should they not behave, and the name became a slang term used within the vulgar mouths of the sailors of the Overthere, but nothing else was ever heard of the legend. Loral knew otherwise. His hunt of the undead of Kunark led him to a tomb outside the new cities of Cabilis. Deep within, past the spectral guardians and skeletal minions, Loral faced and destroyed the vile Xalgoz. From the mouth of the vampire he tore free a tooth. The tooth implanted by Sather two thousands years earlier as the key to Drusella's resting place.</p>

      <p>Venril Sather, the lich-king of the Iksar empire, sat on his granite throne imbued with his dark power. The throne fed him the visions of the outskirts of his keep, the ancient castle of Karnor. He enjoyed the constant strife of the outlanders as they battled with his army of lycanthropes. The mighty Drolvargs tore into the skin and bones of their victims, sending them screaming into the sands of the dead land around the castle. Sather had to admit that the armies of the outlanders were well organized and powerful, but his unlimited supply of undead kept them from ever penetrating his fortress. He was safe within his inner palace, protected by his powers, harvested by the perversion of nature throughout the two thousand years he resided here.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">

      </div>

      <p>Sather was about to contact his spies within the outpost city of Fironia Vie when a young barbarian warrior in blue armor stepped into the door. Silence laid heavy as the two looked at one another. The lich could hardly believe a living thing had managed to even step foot into his throne room, but here he was. Then the instinctive twinge of hunger as he imagined the life force this young warrior must have rang in his mind and he smiled. Floating off of his throne he approached the warrior. Instead of cringing in fear, the warrior swung his twin diamond headed blades and cut into the dead skin of the lich. Sather ignored the cuts, knowing that soon they would close while the life force of the fighter was drained of his body. He thrust his clawed hand at the chest of the warrior, but hit an invisible barrier just before penetrating his armor. Confused and angered, he cut again. The warrior continued slicing into Sather, his blades mostly glancing off of the spells of protection Sather had in place. Sather howled with rage and continued to rip at the warrior, still hitting nothing but air. He was so angered he didn't realize the others that entered the room. Wizards, enchanters, rangers and monks entered, each beginning to cut, bash and blast into Sather's spiritual armor. Enchanters refreshed the energy shields around the single warrior when Sather began to come close to breaking through. Never once was he able to recharge his life force. Soon his own spells failed and he fell to the mighty party.</p>

      <p>Loral stepped through the door, along with a small halfling dressed all in black. The halfling smiled at the corpse of Sather, as did Loral.</p>

      <p>"An excellent job my friend, even Sather's runes of protection were not enough to stop your nimble fingers. Tunare thanks you, as do the citizens of Fironia Vie." The halfling nodded, but smiled greatly when Loral dropped a heavy sack of gems into the halfings hand. Loral had learned what drove these men and knew how to get what it was he required. As the rest of the party looted the room, Loral studied many of the tomes and parchments around the room, searching feverishly for the information he sought. Finally he found a dusty book with an ancient symbol of a lost religion on the cover. He sat crossed legged on the floor and poured over the pages, careful not to let them fall apart in his hands. His eyes widened and his mouth curled into a smile.</p>

      </div>

      <p>A universe away, in a land of ever green pastures, where the woods walked in harmony with the spiritual animals of dreams and wishes, the Mother looked into her pool of visions. She witnessed the deaths of the four pillars of evil in Kunark. She watched as they were slain in her name. She watched as Loral studied the tomes of ancient lands, travel into the depths of dungeons and talk with the loremasters and scribes. She saw Loral at the bazaar in the Commons after spending a week in the depths of Sebilis. She watched him trade for a book from an old grave robber. Skimming the pages he smiled and tucked the book into his pack. He pick up his blackened shield and dark mace and then the visions within Tunare's scrying pool collapsed. She spent a few moments more watching the dark waters of the pool, hoping her visions would return. When they didn't, Tunare wept.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">74@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The departure of their apostle gave the priests of Tunare a small break from their normal bickering and arguing about the coming of the dark ages and the sins of the local tavern, Tovonia's Venom, next door. Young Loral had been with them for seven years, having come to them as an orphan at the age of 10. They knew he wouldn't stay with them forever. His path led out into the world of Norrath, spreading the word of Tunare. The young lad had the sparkle of adventure in his eyes, and it was hard not to feel the same wanderlust when looking at his shining dwarven mail tunic and his worn leather backpack, gifts from the mysterious Ciric Azilebane. Yeolarn Bronzeleaf smiled at Loral as he shook his hand and bowed to the young adventurer, but inside his heart sank. The world held dangers that many couldn't even comprehend, much less survive. He gave Loral one chance in five of returning to them alive. Allia Moondancer, Loral's teacher of the arts, gave Loral a kiss on the cheek and whispered a prayer of safety upon him. Loral blushed, stood up straight and walked out the doors. Yeolarn whispered a prayer himself, hoping it would not be the last time he saw young Loral alive.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/clerics.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 123k"><img src="./images/clerics_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral returns to the clerics of Tunare." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>It was. The figure that stepped back into the Church of Tunare was no longer the young acolyte of Tunare. Loral stepped into the room with swirling lavender boots forged in worlds of darkness. His green robe shifted and shimmered with a life of it's own. His skin had been hardened by the heat of Kunark and the icy winds of Velious, but no part of him was as hardened as his eyes. One gaze gave Yeolarn a view of the horrors and wonders that had passed before Loral. One look was all that was needed for both men to understand the depths of what had happened in the past years. Loral kneeled to the clerics of the church, and tears began flowing from his eyes. Yeolarn's eyes too began to tear. He had hoped that this day would come, that he would see Loral alive again. But after seeing those eyes, he felt that perhaps this fate was the less merciful alternative.</p>

      <p>A storm was blowing over the ancient arena. Clouds moved across the sky faster than the wolves of the Karanas, while lightening struck the ground near by. Many warriors had fought and died in the Arena, and Loral knew that this day would be no different. His preparations for the summoning of Innoruuk were almost complete. While battles raged around him, the focus of hate burning in his chest kept him thinking of the confrontation he would soon face. No spells or blades could stop Loral from seeking the revenge he had sought his whole adult life. One hand held the ancient book of Obulus open to the pages of summoning, the other held the <a href="http://mikeshea.net/everquest/kithicor.html" title="Loral's Adventures in Kithicor">burning black mace of Kithicor</a>, which glowed with a black light. The summoning was almost complete. Then a figure stood in his way. Dressed in the white gowns of a young cleric of Tunare, Idoru, a fellow Healer in his guild and apostle of the Mother stood fast. "Don't do this, Loral. You are under the influence of Innoruuk. Stop this now." Loral looked into her blue eyes, knowing she was right. His heart ached and tears welled up in his eyes. He reached out a hand to her, whispering a prayer to Tunare...and killed her.</p>

      <p>Loral woke with a jolt. That same dream had followed him every night since it took place, weeks earlier. And like it did every morning, his hand burned and he felt the loss of the dark mace, even though its evil had been destroyed that same day. The darkness of its curse still had not left him, but he hoped that it would this day. He sat up on the cold stone, not refreshed, but rested for the coming battle. While he became aware of his dark surroundings, the unnatural stone walls of Innoruuks outer halls of the Plane of hate, the sound of scraping metal sent a shiver through his bones. Loral looked up at Boldog, the large barbarian warrior, sharpening his blade. He watched the barbarian's one good eye, the other cut through from some past battle. He watched and knew the man would soon be dead. Seeing the look in Boldog's eye as he sharpened his huge sword, he knew that the warrior knew it as well. Only a few might survive their battles with the demon-god. More than likely none would. But the warrior knew that the stronger he fought, the more likely he would be killed, for if any gets the attention of Innoruuk, they die.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/innoruuk.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 154k"><img src="./images/innoruuk_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Battle with the God of Hate, Innoruuk" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>A half hour later, Loral was staring at that one good eye again, this time lifeless. He was walking among the wounded of the horrific battle, healing those who could be healed and offering the last rights of Tunare to those he couldn't. Then he came across the body of Boldog and had to stop. He sat there, regaining his strength, but weary of heart. So many dead, so much loss. Then the impact of their accomplishment woke him from this trance. Behind the fighter, lay the corpse of Innoruuk. They had defeated the Lord of Hate. Loral remembered the battle in bits in pieces. He remembered hearing Innoruuk chanting the names of those in the war party, tearing into their souls and stripping them of their lives. "AILEN...VAGE...SOMNUS...WADEN...BOLDOG". One by one the adventurers fell. While wizards unleashed their powerful spells and warriors cut with magical blades, Innoruuk continued to chant. "SOLRAK...RAIZZE...TALTHAR...RAICA." When the mobs of warriors became too thick, he raised his hands and sent the remaining adventurers flying through the air, smashing up against walls and sliding hundreds of feet across the floor. The adventurers quickly regained their footing and rushed the Lord of Hate again. Then, when all appeared lost, Innoruuk stumbled and fell. The blades and spells of the mighty party had finally cut him down.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/innoruuk_dead.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 109k"><img src="./images/innoruuk_dead_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The lord, Innoruuk, lies dead." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>The sheer scope of what Loral had done took a long time to sink in. Sitting there, looking at the corpse of the dark god, Loral thought about what this meant. His whole adult life he had sought this moment. Since the day his father was taken by the Maestro of Rancor, Loral vowed revenge. Now the Maestro lay dead in the hallway after attempting to defend his master, and Innoruuk was killed shortly there after within his own inner chambers. Loral had his revenge. But instead feeling the thrill of victory, he only felt emptiness. He had spent his entire life as a vehicle for revenge under Tunare's name. Innoruuk had used Loral's hate against him and he had almost released the demon-god on all of Norrath under the notion that he might possibly defeat him in a duel. Innoruuk had done far worse than simply kill his father. Innoruuk had stolen his soul and used him as a tool of war. Loral claimed to have followed the will of Tunare, but had killed one of Tunare's most noble and pure clerics, all in the name of revenge. And even now, after having defeated Innoruuk on his home ground, now he had nothing left.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/loral_and_tunare.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 122k"><img src="./images/loral_and_tunare_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral faces the Mother of All, Tunare." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>In his early years as an adventurer, Loral had dreams of finding his father in the outerworld prisons of Hate. Those dreams were shattered when he realized just how insignificant he and his father were to Innoruuk. All that he had to show for his life of vengeance was the black scar on his hand from the black mace, and the sadness of knowing he had used the name of his goddess to murder an innocent. He wasn't sure what would become of his life now. But he knew one thing. He must ask for forgiveness. He would seek out the clerics of Felwithe and apologize for his actions in their name. He would then seek out Tunare herself and accept whatever fate she would have for his sins. His only hope was to once again be her hand on Norrath. If not, he would do his best to spread her faith and her love, even if he was doomed by the acts of his past.</p>

      <p>It was a beautiful autumn day in Felwithe. Loral couldn't decide which was warmer. The summer sun overhead or the smile of his father when he pulled up the large bass out of the clear river that ran outside their home. Talien the Jeweler patted his young son on the back, sharing in the joy of the catch. While there were times when Loral became bored of the constant haggling between his father and a customer, the Sunday fishing trips were the times Loral really look forward to. Loral would sit and watch the fish through the clear stream while his father would tell him stories of the far away cities of Kaladim, Kelethin and even Ak'Anon, land of the curious gnomes. Loral would imagine the strange cities of fiery forges and giant machines while his father spoke. Other times, Talien would tell Loral of his mother, and although sometimes they made him sad, he more often felt the happiness that her memory brought to his father. Those fishing trips meant everything to Loral. They were the best moments of his life.</p>

<p>The bickering between the Church of Tunare and the Paladin's Guild had gone on for hours. Loral almost wished he had stayed the outcast he once was, but then remembered <a href="darkness.html" title="Loral's passage of darkness">the dark times</a> and thanked Tunare that he was once again her hand in Norrath. Loral sat in the back of the meeting hall, absently twisting one of his velium rings around his finger over and over and watching his green robes swirl while the debate raged on. The subject of whether the Elven nations would support the Coldain Dwarves of Thurgadin against the Kromrif Giants of Kael had gone on for weeks, but today it finally looked as though they might have a plan. They would send in a spy, someone who could find out what the Kromrif had in store for the Elven nations. If their grasp was farther than Thurgadin, the Fier'Dal would make a decision. Before another huge debate started, Loral raised his hand and volunteered for the job. He was already an enemy of the Velious frost giants, he explained, and he had a good idea where to look for this information. He also knew the perfect partner.</p>

      <p>Cold wind bit at Loral's exposed face like a thousand Bixie daggers. It howled over the dunes of white snow and chilled his armor to his skin as he lay face down watching the front of the large fortress. <em>Where is she</em>, he thought as he watched the two frost giant guards outside the keep. It wouldn't be long before the patrol was back and that would mean dealing with four more of these monsters. Loral peeked once again into the Gnomish spyglass, a gift from the druid Wrenne, scanning over the desolate land behind him. She was no where in sight. Then as he was just about to collapse the spyglass, there she was.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Azile Ciricbane, the Erudite Evoker had her dark green hood pressed close in against the biting wind. Loral smiled as he watched her lips wording a thousand curses towards the blizzard above. It appeared that even her elemental armor could not take the sting out of the icy weather. She trudged through the snow, using her long staff to help her make her way, and came up to Loral's position. She looked down at Loral's red boots, a gift from the Healer Akaysa, and sighed. Loral smiled at her.</p>

      <p>"I was wondering how long it was going to take you. We haven't much time. The patrol will be back soo.."</p>

      <p>"We have all the time we need, they will not be back," Azile cut him off without even looking at him. She reached into a bag that hung around her waste and dropped four Velium swords to the ground. "Lets get on with this, I haven't all day." Loral smiled to himself as she continued to walk past him towards the front of the keep, not even bothering to conceal herself from the guards ahead. She was right, he nodded, they had a mission to accomplish.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/kromiff_outpost.jpg"><img src="./images/kromiff_outpost_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Kromrif Outpost of the Eastern Wastes" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Deep in the icy lands of the Eastern Wastes, surrounded by tons of rock and a platoon of Kromrif soldiers, Fjloaren Icebane seethed. He had been in charge of this fort for almost five months now and there seemed to be no sign that he would be brought back to Kael and promoted. Five months ago he had been offered his own command, his own garrison of troops and his own fort. Instead of the great stronghold of Wakening Lands, or the forward outpost in Greater Divide, he was given command of the worst post he knew of, the outpost of Eastern Wastes. Instead of immediate promotion and honor of leading armies against the Coldain, Fjloraren spent his days bargaining with the horribly stupid Ry'Gorr orcs or sending out raiding parties to destroy the lumbering Ulthork and the occasional Snow Griffin. Only the most incompetent soldiers working for the Kromrif were ever sent to this fort and it drove Fjloaren mad to know this. Fjloaren pretended to study a map of the area in his hut, while he stewed over this horrible turn of luck. He had no idea that in a short twenty minutes he would be dead.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/azile_blasting.jpg"><img src="./images/azile_blasting_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Azile unleashes her wrath" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Guard Kazul's feeble mind couldn't comprehend why this lone woman would walk so boldly towards the front gates of the outpost he guarded, but there she was. Dressed in green robes and carrying a long staff, the figure walked up as if she belonged in the place. He looked over to Faroth, the other guard, and smiled at him. Kazul then saw the thin tendrils, thousands of them, that laced Faroth from the ground all the way to his neck like a package of meat, paralyzing him. Kazul, finally realizing what had happened, reached for his own sword just before his head exploded.</p>

      <p>Although angered that this attack had come as a surprise, Fjloarin was happy to be in battle once again no matter what the circumstances. He lifted his great battle axe from the table and in three steps was outside of his hut. The blast of fire greater than any known in nature almost blew him back into his hut. Outside, a single figure unleashed the flames of hell upon his troops. Azile turned towards another guard who rushed out of the hut next to Fjlorain's, exposing her back to him.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/loral_vs_icebane.jpg"><img src="./images/loral_vs_icebane_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral battles Fjloarin Icebane" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Fjloarin had been passed up many times for promotion for his blind ferocity and rage but he wasn't as stupid as his superiors thought. He carefully walked behind the wizard and raised his axe high. Before he could cleave the wizard in two from the top of her head to the ground below his kneecap burst. Roaring with rage and pain, Fjloarin fell to his good leg and faced his attacker. Loral Ciriclight stood ready to battle the giant. In his hand was a shining mithral mace of the Fier'Dal, the standard weapon for the priests of Tunare, which replaced <a href="kithicor.html" title="Loral acquires the dark mace">the dark mace he once held</a>. Loral called Tunare's retribution and an eruption of energy blasted Fjloarin hard. Fjloarin stood up ignoring the crunch his knee made and slashed at the cleric. Loral barely avoided getting severed in half as the huge axe glanced off of his transparent shield. Fjloarin slashed again and Loral ducked out of the way, but not before taking a cut across his shoulder and chest. A kick from Fjloarin sent Loral sprawling. Loral rolled to avoid another cut from the huge axe, but had no where left to go. Fjloarin raised the axe one final time, smiling when he imagined wiping Loral's remains from the blade when his chest exploded outward. For a second he stood there, the four foot hole in his armor spewing smoke into the air. His axe fell out of his hands to the ground and he toppled face first to the ground. Loral stood up, looking at the hole which had burned through the giant's back. Azile's expression hadn't changed since he had seen her walking towards the fort before. Loral called upon the power of Tunare and healed the wound on his chest and shoulder. Together they walked into Fjloarin's hut.</p>

        <a href="./images/loral_at_council.jpg"><img src="./images/loral_at_council_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral and Azile at the Council" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>The council meeting was still raging when the doors opened up, splashing sunlight into the great hall. Loral stepped through with Azile behind him. The ambassador of the Kaladim dwarves, a scarred retired general now a diplomat, explained the minds of the dwarves. They were ready to wage war on behalf of their distant cousins, the Coldain, and hoped that the elves would help their cause. The Fier'Dal chancellor explained that their forces could not be spared until more of the situation was known. Loral knew that this indecision would change as the information he carried came to light. The room went silent when he walked to the main table and dropped the documents from the Kromrif outpost on the table. He turned and addressed all the members that sat in the large hall.</p>

      <p>"There is no longer a question of our involvement in this war my friends. We no longer have a choice. The Kromrif are at this moment preparing a siege greater than any they have unleashed against the noble Coldain. They are preparing for war against Tunare herself in the Plane of Growth."</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p><em>A strange note is delivered to you sealed with the crest of the Clerics of Tunare. You open the note and find the following message written in the handwriting of Loral Ciriclight.</em></p>

      <p>Ungdin was just like us. He was a loving husband and father of three children. He was a worshiper of his God. He was a merchant and miner. But unlike us, he was a Coldain. Unlike the other Coldains, he didn't live secretly behind the vast mountain caverns. He lived in a small hut on the outskirts of the Eastern Wastes, mining for Velium in the mountains. One day, he came back to his hut after a hard and long day of mining to find his life completely upturned. His wife and his children had been murdered. His hut had been ransacked and all his possessions looted. What beasts would do such a thing to a simple dwarven miner?<br />
      <br />
      The Kromrif of Kael Drakkal.<br />
      <br />
      </p>

      <p>For a thousand years the Kromrif have kept the kindly dwarven nation of Thurgadin in hiding. Their every move brings pain and misery. It is only a matter of time before all nations of Norrath will face the threat of the Kromrif. As nobles of the most honorable guild in Norrath, I ask all the Healers to join me in this war against Kael. Join the Coldain and the Claws of Veeshan as allies against the Kromrif. Battle the vile giants, not the little people or the scaled children of Veeshan. Their strength mixed with our own can be the key to our success.</p>

      <p>As a guild our strength lies with each other. If we choose to battle the giants instead of the Coldain or the claws of Veeshan, we can acquire greater treasure and further our travels into the wastelands of Velious. Portals that would otherwise be completely closed to us will open with loving arms. Quests for treasures beyond our imagination will be achievable. And more importantly, we will be doing the right thing.</p>

      <p>Ungdin now mines within the city of Thurgadin, down in the dark tunnels below. He has managed to rebuild his life as a miner, but not a day goes by where he doesn't miss his wife and children. Help avenge their death and help the Coldain in their eternal struggle with these monsters. Help yourselves in the process by allowing us safe passage through Thurgadin, Skyshrine, Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar. Help yourselves by opening up the treasures of the Temple of Veeshan.<br />
      <br />
       Help us all by proving that we are truly Healer "United".<br />
      <br />
       Your friend,<br />
      <br />
       Loral Ciriclight<br />
       Cleric of Tunare</p>

      <p><br />
      <br />
      <strong>/ooc</strong></p>

      <p>The time has come for our guild to decide whether we should support the Coldain, the Kromrif or the Claws of Veeshan. My recommendation based on my experiences in Velious and from the information I have gathered from many of the Everquest web sites is to support both the Coldain and the Claws of Veeshan factions and fight the Kromrif in Kael.</p>

      <p>There are a few reasons for this. Our guild is more likely to be successful on the Thurgadin quests than the Kael quests since the corroded armor drops in Kael. If we do manage to get to the point where we can achieve Kael armor by hunting in the Temple of Veeshan, we can also achieve the Skyshrine quests which results in better armor overall.</p>

      <p>If our Claws of Veeshan faction is higher, it is far easier to travel to the western zones of Velious including Wakening Lands, Cobalt Scar, Sirins Grotto, Western Wastes, Dragon Necropolis, and the Temple of Veeshan. With bad Claws faction, travel in these zones is almost impossible.</p>

      <p>The teleport locations in Wakening Lands and Colbalt Scar are almost totally cut off if you damage your Claws of Veeshan faction, limiting your ability to travel within velious.</p>

      <p>My plan is to run many raids and events in these areas. If your faction follows the plan above, we can have many great adventures in these lands. If not, you may not be able to attend these events.</p>

      <p>Ally yourself with the Coldain Dwarves of Thurgadin, the children of Veeshan in Skyshrine and battle the vile Kromrif of Kael and you will be doing a service to your guild and all of Norrath.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>A cool breeze brought the scents of fragrant flowers, cooking meat, and clear waters. The sounds of trees rustling and of a near-by waterfall made Dog's ears perk lazily into the air. Dog was relaxing under the shade of a tree, watching his friend, Rex, wrestle a smaller companion to the ground by grabbing it's hind legs in his mouth and pulling forward. It wasn't angry fighting, it was fun fighting and that made Dog happy. Rex and the younger one bounded and yelped happily at each other. In a little while Dog would join them, but now Dog was full and preferred sit in the soft green grass, listen to the soft sounds, and smell the smells of this happy and green place. Dog had never felt such peace in his life.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/dog.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 193k"><img src="./images/dog_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Dog" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Dog woke with a kick to his side and he yelped as he came to his feet. Gone was the soft breeze, replaced by the harsh frigid air as it billowed through the caverns around him. The feeling of his full stomach was replaced with the growling pain of hunger he had known all his life. He looked around for Rex but remembered that he hadn't seen him in some time. Others were there, the mean ones. Dog liked happy fighting, but these others were mean and angry. They smelled of hate and blood. Dog had been here as far back as he could remember. He was always cold and always hungry. Sometimes he would be taken out into the snow where he wasn't allowed to play and chase the small bunnies, but instead had to track for Masser. Most of the time Dog stayed in the icy pit, with the others. They were all cold and hungry and always angry. They weren't nice like Rex was, they didn't like each other and they didn't like him. This made Dog sad, he missed Rex.</p>

      <p>After getting to his feet, Dog suddenly smelled something in the air. Strangers, here in his home. Masser was above him, yelling angrily as usual. He was pushing Dog and the others through the icy caverns and into the larger halls. Everyone was excited, and this made Dog afraid. Strangers didn't often come here, and when they did, it was always exciting. It also meant food, which was good, Dog was very hungry. But it meant something else. It meant the bad word. Dog didn't like the bad word though the others did.</p>

      <p>Masser pushed and kicked them into the main halls where others like Masser were all running around. At the end of the hall, a group of small ones stood. They smelled different than Maser, it was far less strong. They also made sounds much lower and more soothing than the gruff and loud noises Masser and his kind made. There were about twelve of them, in a small pack. They held many sharp things and some had strange lights around their hands and bodies. Masser's people slashed and cut at the small ones with their sharp-sticks, while the small ones dove and dodged.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/dog_battle.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 302k"><img src="./images/dog_battle_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The battle with the small ones." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>When Masser saw the small ones, he kicked Dog forward and Dog knew the bad word would come. Dog hated the word but didn't remember why. Even though it meant a full belly and it made Masser happy, it made Dog sad. But he knew had no choice. The others around him lowered down to the ground, ready to pounce with shouts and howls of excitement. Dog got in line as well, he knew what he must do. Then the word came.</p>

      <p>"Kill!"</p>

      <p>Dog and the others rushed into the mob of small ones. Dog was aware of the others falling or yelping as strange lights hit them or they were poked with the sharp-sticks. He was aware of the sad and dark smells of burning hair and blood. He saw the small ones scatter and lunge, avoiding the charge of Dog and his pack. The others each picked out a small one to wrestle, and Dog picked his as well, a smaller one than even the others, holding a stick and wearing dark robes. Dog almost stopped when the aroma of the small one caught him, it was the smell of the fields and streams he had been dreaming of. A sudden vision of the pond and trees came back but was soon out of his mind as the word struck him again. He bared his teeth and lunged at the small one, knowing that soon the horrible burning in his stomach would be gone. Then the small one spoke to him. It wasn't the guttural noises of Maser, it was smooth and as coherent as he could imagine.</p>

      <p>"He is not your master, he is the enemy. You have been hurt by him and he will hurt you again. Attack him and you will be free. I am your master and I love you."</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/dog_and_rex.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 190k"><img src="./images/dog_and_rex_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The battle with the small ones." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Dog's head swam with the memories of his entire life with more clarity than ever before. He remembered the day his mother was taken from him, along with her soothing warmth and mother's milk. He remembered being beaten and yelled at by Masser, being told to "Kill" as he attacked other small ones. He remembered wrestling happily with Rex, but then remembered something very sad. He remembered hearing the word, but this time while in a hole with Rex. Rex heard the word too and they were both sad, they didn't want to wrestle each other down here. But they did. Rex went for his back legs but Dog managed to clamp down on Rex's throat as he rushed in. Dog squeezed even as Rex yelped and thrashed about. He continued to squeeze, feeling warmth drip down his throat and mouth, until Rex went to sleep. Masser took him away and fed him which made him happy, but he never saw Rex again. All of these memories flooded through his mind, but one thought stayed constant. Masser didn't love him.</p>

      <p>He turned and saw Masser shouting the word over and over. He would follow the word, but not on the small one who loved him. Dog rushed and jumped at Masser, sinking his teeth into Masser's throat. Dog smelled the fear inside him. He heard the shouts and excitement from the others around him and heard the high pitched scraping of the sharp-stick Maser kept at his belt. Dog felt a sudden sharp pain in his side. He felt warmth on his side where the pain was, but also felt warmth in his mouth and knew that this was good. Maser fell to the ground with Dog on top of him. The sharp pain came back, this time in his stomach. He heard Masser's sounds of gurgling become softer. Than the sounds stopped. Masser had gone to sleep, and that made Dog happy. Dog tried to stand up but realized he couldn't. He rolled off of Maser and landed on his side in the icy cavern. It was hard to breath. His eyes fell onto the small one who spoke nicely to him, the one who loved him. The small one smiled at him and made soothing sounds that Dog couldn't understand. He knew he had done well and was happy. Then Dog went to sleep.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/dog_in_growth.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 236k"><img src="./images/dog_in_growth_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Doggie Heaven." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>The cool evening made Dog feel a little sleepy as he sat in the field of grass, watching the fish in the stream. He listened to the quiet sounds of trees rustling and birds chirping. His belly was full and he was happy. When he first arrived here Dog met a tall pretty woman who smelled like the grassy lands around him. When he had wondered what this place was, the woman spoke in a soft voice to him the same way the small one did. The woman told him to be happy, that he would never be hungry, he could sleep when he wished, and could always play with his friend, Rex. Most importantly, he would never have to hear the bad word again. Dog stood up slowly and trotted across the stream. On the other side was Rex, who was chasing a small one around a group of trees. Both Rex and the small one were happy and having great fun. Dog was happy to see his friend again and trotted down to join them. Dog had never felt such peace in his life.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>The sound of rattling bone and steel on stone echoed along with the screams of the tortured souls in the Plane of Hate. A slender figure strode past the hideously twisted minions of the Dark Lord, taking no notice as they snapped to attention when he passed. Behind the figure walked two enormous trolls wearing the bone armor of ancient beasts and carrying the glowing black blades of Innoruuk's elite guard. The blood red cloak of the Elven figure billowed out behind him, a deep contrast to the dark purple armor and pale skin of Innoruuk's high priest and military advisor. The three figures climbed up the steps of Innoruuk's church and the two trolls turned to guard the entrance as Loral Ciriclight stepped past the great archway. Inside sat the Prince of Darkness upon his throne of the skulls of heroes. Innoruuk smiled.</p>

      <p>"You cannot deny who you are, my friend. Though you were made aware, one cannot change what lies in one's heart." Loral placed his hand over the symbol of Innoruuk that hung around his neck and kneeled before his master.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/loral_in_apartment.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 117k"><img src="./images/loral_in_apartment_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral's Apartment" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral woke with a start to the sound of breaking glass from the tavern next door. Apparently another debate over the price of velium or of Kormrif Spit Vodka had erupted into the all too common Coldain bar brawl. Loral had once been shocked and horrified by the event but eventually understood it as a typical social encounter with the sturdy dwarves. Why the bartender insisted on installing a new window every night was a question that always baffled Loral.</p>

      <p>Loral got off his small cot and stretched out. These quarters were a little crampt and didn't offer as much privacy as Loral wished, but living with the Coldain miners offered Loral a perspective of Coldain life that he never would have gotten from the high class inn he was originally offered when he came to stay in Thurgadin.</p>

      <p>Loral put on his green robes of Tunare and began to step outside of the small apartment when he found a sealed letter at the doorway. It had been stamped by no fewer than four of the Antonican bards who delivered out this way, a long journey for such a package and very expensive. As soon as Loral recognized the wax seal as that of Yeolarn Bronzeleaf the High Priest of Tunare, he opened it at once.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><em>My Dear Loral,</em></p>

        <p><em>It is with saddened heart that I give you the following news. A great horror has befallen our people and our Lady Tunare. An epic battle between the avatar of the Mother and the beast Cazic Thule took place a week ago. Our Lady has fallen and a plague of evil has taken over the lands of Lesser Faydark. Undead Sprites tear apart every living thing that resides within and even the Lady Fironia Vie's advisor, Quellimaine, has been perverted into serving the Beast.</em></p>

        <p><em>At this very moment the council of the Sword and the Church of Tunare are in session to determine a course of action.</em></p>

        <p><em>Because of these dark times the council of Felwithe is unable to provide aid to the noble Coldain in their war with the Kromrif.</em></p>

        <p><em>I know this comes as a great disappointment to you. For that I am sorry my friend.</em></p>

        <p><em>I wish you and your friends well and may the Mother watch over us all.</em></p>

        <p><em>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf</em></p>

        <p><em>High Priest of Tunare</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Loral dropped the note to the floor and wept.</p>

      <p>For months Loral had assisted in the raiding parties and spy teams gathering information and hindering the progression of the Kromrif armies. Loral's reputation with the Coldain had gone from suspicion and mistrust into respect and admiration over the months. When Loral returned to the council of Thurgadin with the news that the Kromrif would be invading within a week, the Dain put every able bodied dwarf under the command of his field general and top officers. They immediately began preparation for the battle to come, a far cry from the political meetings of the Felwithe council that usually lasted for weeks. The Dain was saddened to hear of the lack of Fier'dal support but took Loral's personal attendance and offer to assist as a sign of good faith if not for the High Elves than of himself.</p>

      </div>

      <p>For three days and nights Loral sat in the cold damp caverns of the Greater Divide and battled the Kromrif. A short distance to the north was the waterfall entrance to Thurgadin, protected by the army of the mightest Coldain warriors. A fellow member of Healers United, the Lady Catlin, sent reports of their battles and of the progression of the Kromrif army. Only a short distance away Loral's group, a mix of the most powerful mercenaries and adventurers from all over Norrath, drew small groups of the Kromrif warriors and veterans out and awy from Thurgadin, slowly but surely thinning out their numbers. For three days they fought, filling the snow and the stream with the blood of giants. On the evening of the third day, Loral was healing the wounds of the scouts when he came across the mighty Shadowknight, Ggan the Reaver. The scarred troll wore an entire suit of bone armor and carried a black pulsing blade. Though no one was very comfortable sitting next to the dark knight, Loral found him more disturbing than most but couldn't understand exactly why. Upon noticing Loral's stare, Ggan grinned bearing great fangs and deepening the scar that cut through his face. Loral hurried past.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/narandi.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 117k"><img src="./images/narandi_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Nerandi the Wretched" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>A few minutes later it was announced that Narandi the Wretched himself had joined his troops in battle. Defeating him would send the Kromrif armies into disarray and Thurgadin would be safe. The scouts were quickly sent out to draw him away from the armies and to the caverns where the adventurers ambush awaited. Enraged by the though that so few had killed so many giants, Narandi took the bait and rushed quickly into the trap. The enchanted blades of a dozen warriors cut in at him while powerful spells unleashed the elements. Narandi's great sword, carved from teh bones of an ancient wyrm, cut down the warriors one after another. No prayer of healing cold protect them in time. The clerics quickly abandoned healing the warriors and instead began resurrecting them as soon as they had been killed. Fallen warriors shook off the chill of death, picked ub their weapons and continued the battle with Narandi the Wretched. The blades of the risen warriors began to cut deep into Narandi's thick hide, sending him into a rage. Great waves of flame poured over the giant and with one last howl, the lord of the Kromrif invasion was destroyed.</p>

      <p>The familiar crash of the tavern's front window woke Loral with a start. Loral sighed and stretched out feeling his back crack. Many windows had been installed and broken since the Kromrif army had been routed and their field commander slain. One happy dwarf even had the honor of being thrown through it by the hero of the outlanders, a rogue of all people, after a particularly crass remark about intimate relations with a tree. Loral noticed another package at his door, this one larger and stamped with the seal of his mentor, Ciric Azilebane. Inside Loral found a small book, handwritten under Ciric's pen, entitled "A Guide to the Claws of Veeshan". Lorla spent two days in his small hut studying the words within the book. Loral might have found the ally he needed after all. The most powerful ally in all of Norrath.</p>

<p>No creature is as feared and admired as the mighty dragon. While the younger races of Norrath battle for lands, titles and treasure, the dragonkin have evolved as slowly as a mountain. Their power and their wisdom is the greatest known on Norrath. The following theories are taken from the loose scriptures of ancient texts. Our people have only just begun to understand the true power of these mighty beasts and it will be centuries before we stand a hope of truly discovering their mysteries. Our greatest hope is that we may one day stand side by side with the scaled children of Veeshan.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">

      </div>

      <p>During the first days of Norrath, there was nothing. An entire world had been created capable of sustaining all life but it stood naked. The greatest of the Gods, the crystalline dragon Veeshan, swooped down from the plane of Sky and tore open the lands of Velious with one mighty swoop. She deposited upon the land the first of all races, her children, the dragons. For a millenia they ruled all of Norrath. Their mighty wings beat through the air, their great wisdom and intellect studied the mysteries of the land. They built great monuments to their goddess. They built a society of honor and justice. Thus began the Age of Scale.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/derasinal.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 302k"><img src="./images/derasinal_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Derasinal" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Soon after, the other gods began populating Norrath. The mortal races were born, grew up, fought and died all in the blink of an eye to the dragonkin. The dragons evolved like Norrath itself, their children coming only within centuries and living thousands of years. While the other races scrambled to survive from the dangers of the worlds and from each other, the dragons spent their time learning what powers and wisdom the earth held. Then the races met. The younger children of Norrath fled in fear from the mighty dragonkind, spreading rumors of hate and murder.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/woushi3.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 302k"><img src="./images/woushi3_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Woushi, guardian of Wakening Lands" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>It became known to the dragonkin that though they were much more powerful and wiser than the younger races, that their small numbers put them in danger. Two factions of the mighty dragons split apart. One, the Ring of Scale moved to the towering mountains of Veeshan's Peaks. The other stayed within the icy claws of Velious, isolated from the rest of Norrath.</p>

      <p>The Ring of Scale began getting involved in the interactions between the younger races. The betrothed dragons, Lord Nagafin and Lady Vox built lairs within the lands of Antonica and sent out their goblin and giant armies upon the world. They were the first to have contact with the younger races who spent years hunting them down.</p>

      <p>In the tropical lands of Kunark, the Ring of Scale sent forth a race of scaled humanoids, the Sarnak, to do their bidding. Along with the Sarnak, four dragons were sent out from the Peaks into the lands. The mightest of these four, the dragon Trakanon, had his spirit ripped from him by the earliest and most powerful necromancy. He took vengeance upon those who stole his life and ruled from within the ruins of their mightiest city. Another of them, the red wyrm, Talendar, stood guard outside the gates of Veeshan's Peaks. The other two, Gorinare and Solandar, wandered the lands learning what they could and sending back information of the races progress within the land. Within the Peaks, the mightiest of the Ring of Scale still commanded their agents and legions of troops within the societies of Norrath.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Back in their home of Velious, the Claws of Veeshan led by their mightiest, Vulak'Aerr, began construction of the Temple of Veehsan deep within the Western Wastes. Here they build the halls of testing, a place where mortals could be tested in order to prove their worth in the aid of the Dragonkin. The hall also became their place of worship to the goddess Veeshan and their place of work, unleashing the mightiest artifacts and spells ever known on Norrath. One such spell even unlocked a doorway to the Plane of Mischief, home of the insane god BristleBane. The protection of the temple itself was entrusted to Sontalak, a great wyrm known for his might and ability to sniff out the smallest attempt of deception. For centuries the children of Veeshan lived in peace. Many of the dragons wandered the Western Wastes, filling the breeding grounds with eggs that took centuries to hatch. The isolation of the land afforded them a protection even their own magic couldn't provide.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">

      </div>

      <p>As the mortals grew stronger, reports of their expansion into the lands of Velious grew. Knowing that they could not remain isolated forever, the leaders of the Claws built a great city and entrusted its well being to one of their children, the dragon Yelinak. His minions, including great wyverns, wurms, drakes and their creations, guarded the city and established a level of commerce with the outside world. Though separated by the mighty giant city, Kael Drakkal, the Coldain dwarves and the city of Skyshrine shared a mutually beneficial trade for stone and metal. Deep within the city, Yelinak and his closest advisors continued to research the powers of Norrath. The city served well as a layer of isolation for the Claws of Veeshan and their home within the Western Wastes.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">

      </div>

      <p>For a millenia the oldest of the Claws had kept a dark secret from even the younger members of their brood. Apparently the Claws had known of a great power, one darker and more powerful than any ever discovered. It was a power that could threaten the lands of Norrath itself if unleashed. Little was ever known about this power except that it was locked away inside of a tomb centuries before the dragonkin migrated to the Western Wastes. The tomb was sealed by the power of the mightest dragons, the Dar Brood, and sealed inside were the most powerful dragons ever to have lived. These dragons, the Warders, sacrificed their lives to help keep the danger locked from the rest of the world. To die for one's cause is considered noble. To be locked inside of a dark pit for an eternity is something above honor. This great danger was only known as the Sleeper.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">

      </div>

      <p>As the mortals began to migrate into the lands of Vellious, some of the dragonkin felt that the sacrifice of the Ring of Scale was not enough to protect them, they felt that only a clensing of the planet could keep the children protected. One of these spoke louder than all the others. Zlandicar the Black felt that unleashing the Sleeper would wipe clean the planet from the menace that would surly come inside of their homes. Zlandicar had felt loss at the hands of the mortals and took a far stronger view than many of the others. One of the high council, a great and wise wyrm known as Jaled Dar attempted to calm Zlandicar and spoke against his theories but to no avail. In a horrible event that shook the very structure of the Claws of Veehsan, Zlandicar killed Jaled Dar and was outcast deep within a dark land known as Dragon Necropolis. There he would reside among the carrion that fed on the dead wyrms of old. But recently, rumors have heard a voice, that of the ghost of Jaled Dar whispering of revenge in their minds. Though nothing more than a spirit, it plots to destroy Zlandicar by using his own weapon against him.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">

      </div>

      <p>These days the dragons have begun to recruit mortals into their fold, offering artifacts of power greater than any ever held by mortal in return for service against those who would hunt them down like dogs. They continue to research the most powerful lore ever known and share pieces of it with those they deem worthy. Their testing halls stand open to those who believe they have the strength to endure some of the greatest wrath ever felt. Those that survive are given great treasures those that don't are offered the void.</p>

      <p>There is no creature on Norrath that is as mysterious as the mighty dragons. While once thought to be a scourge upon the lands and a menace to her people, history shows that these creatures have as rich a culture and as wise a mind as any society that has ever lived. It would be one of the greatest adventures for any people to gain their trust and open up the wealth of knowledge and resources that this noble tribe has to offer. To turn our backs, or worse yet our blades, upon these mighty beings is to throw our mightiest books, spells and weapons into the fires of Hate. To side against the dragonkin is to side against Norrath herself for they are the first children to walk upon the earth. Any that seek a union with the noble children of Veehsan would see the smiles of the Gods upon them.</p>

<p>Ice as hard as stone cracked open as the claw of the mighty dragon tore into the ground. The huge creature thundered across the icy planes as her pursuers closed in. Hsagra, sorceress of Veeshan and first brood of the dragons of Norrath, whirled around and unleashed a wide column of fire. Ice turned into steam burning those around it, but the Kromzek soldier who caught the blast was instantly vaporized. Hsagra's wings beat at the air as she once again fled from the small army of giants that chased her through the ice. While she had killed dozens of them upon their initial attack, with wings torn, and scales pierced she knew the peril of frontal combat. She stormed up a small hill and dug her claws into a large rock that jutted out of the ice. Whirling she began chanting her mightiest incantation and another flaming column disintegrated one of her perusers, this time a Kromzek captain. The small victory gave her hope that she could reach the Temple and gain the assistance of Sontalak, the guardian. She began her descent down the opposite side of the hill when Porlos' trap sprung. Her claw sunk into the snow and the wood and steel jaws of an enormous trap crushed her leg. Howling with pain, Hsagra fell to her side and saw the line of giants flanking her. In the middle of them was the sorcerer-king, Porlos, his red flowing cape billowing in the icy winds against his golden armor. The spearmen that accompanied him rushed in and stabbed at Hsagra's underbelly. Porlos' began chanting and a whirlwind of frost colder than any known in nature burned and cracked her scales wide open. Hsagra shrieked and fell back, gasping for one last breath. Instead of air, her lungs only felt the stab of Leutenant Derakor's blade as he stabbed through her into the ice below.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/yelinak_howl.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 188k"><img src="./images/yelinak_howl_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Lord Yelinak howls." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Deep under the ground of the dragon city of Skyshrine, Yelinak wailed as he watched the giants behead his wingmate through his murky scrying pool. He felt his sanity slipping further as they stripped the scales from her carcass and King Porlos broke free one of her large teeth. Yelinak and Hsagra had known a love for each other that had lasted longer than many empires of Norrath. They had grown up over centuries within the comfort of eachother. Now he was alone, with only the icy cavern around him to protect him from the world. He begged Veeshan to wake him from this horrible nightmare and when no dawn came he silently prayed for the Sleeper to be unleashed and finish his misery. Knowing that his oath to the Claws of Veeshan forbade any such action, he hung onto the only thing he could. Revenge.</p>

      <p>Loral's finger slid across the gash in the rock that Hsagra's giant claw had torn into it over five thousand years past. Though the winds had softened the gash, it was still very pronounced against the smooth stone. Loral turned to his party and followed their eyes to the line of giants below. A captain of the Kromzek force was bellowing orders to the troop, preparing them for the scouting mission against the dragon nursery. The excitement of the troop gave Loral the idea that they would do more than gather information should they come across a younger, weaker wyrm. The ranger to Loral's right whispered a prayer to the Mother and vanished. His steps could be seen in the thin powdered snow that covered the ice below as he approached the line of giants.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/temple_of_veeshan_door_t.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 188k"><img src="./images/temple_of_veeshan_door_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The doorway to the Temple of Veeshan." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Seconds later, both the ranger and Loral fled to the caverns nearby, hoping to lose the giants that fast approached. While they had succeeded in dulling the minds of many of the troop, Loral's friend, Coelin, had been killed by the captain when he noticed the wood elf whispering soothing sounds to his men. Now the captain and one of his guard were almost upon the two remaining adventurers when they disappeared into a small cave. The captain stormed up to the cave but instead of finding the two elves within, he found the glowing blade of Ggan, the shadowknight. With one mighty cut, the Captain was hobbled to the ground. Spells and weapons of the mightiest adventurers quickly dispatched the captain and his guard.</p>

      <p>An hour later, Loral had given the scout Charisa, an agent of the Claws, the broken artifact he found on the captain. She smiled and handed Loral a talisman of the Claws, a globe with a tiny flame inside enclosed in a golden cage. Loral took the talisman and tied it to his belt. He and his friends bowed to Charisa and left for the warm beds of Thurgadin.</p>

      <p>After weeks spent in the libraries of Skyshrine and consulting with the wurm spellcasters of Yelinak's guard, Azile the Sorceress learned much of the ancient spells of the Claws of Veeshan. She listened to the tale of Hsagra's doom and of Yelinak's seclusion. She learned that once, another great dragon spellcaster, Relnar had constructed the lost spells of Hsagra. After days of travel through the icy winds of Western Wastes, far from the warm climate of Odus, Azile traveled to the great scar of Velious that acted as the doorway to the temple of Veeshan. Outside stood seven great wyrms, each with the power to destroy an entire city. Four of these were of Relnar's brood and having heard of her interests in the dragon's favor, they nodded their great heads as she confronted them. Great clouds of vapor left their nostrils as she recited what she had learned. They spoke with her of the powerful spells of Hsagra and gave her four runes, artifacts of Relnar's teachings in return for her vow to assist them in their war with the giants. A week later she was back in Skyshrine, meeting with Lawla, the scribe of Skyshrine to put together the lore she had gathered.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/thurg_bar.jpg" title="jpeg image 1024x768 117k"><img src="./images/thurg_bar_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Thurgadin Bar" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral was having a friendly chat with the barkeep in the Coldain miner's bar of Thurgadin when Azile drifted silently through the door. Loral stood and embraced the Erudite who looked pale compared with her normal ebony complexion. They picked out a small table for two and Loral poured Azile a small glass of Winterfalls Wine, a specialty of the establishment, and a drink Loral fancied when he couldn't drink a glass of Tunare's Finest from his home town of Felwithe. She pushed the glass away and stared coldly at Loral.</p>

      <p>"I have it, my friend. The magic of the dragon sorcerers is mine. Soon, the giants of Kael will feel Hsagra's wrath."</p>

      <p>Loral shivered a bit at this thought. While they had discussed their plans in the war with the Kromrif and Kromzek of Kael Drakkal, a small voice in the back of Loral's mind wailed softly. Loral quickly shook the voice away and stared across at his old friend and protector.</p>

      <p>"Than feel it they shall."</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/temple_bridge.jpg" title="Bridge leading to the Temple of Zek"><img src="./images/temple_bridge.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Main hall of the temple of Zek." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>For a thousand years it had stood and guarded. It had lived through three different kings and hundreds of political disputes that ended in blood. Five hundred of the mightiest warriors of Kael had died in the arena under his reign as the sole guardian of Zek. He was the only surviver of the reign of Porlos the Sorcerer-king. While King Tormax knew his legacy and his power, he never made a move against the guardian, knowing that to do so was to risk the wrath of Zek and possibly his own death. Derakor the Vindicator cared not for politics or squabbling. It did not care of the war with the Coldain, a topic though hundreds of years old felt like a drop in the bucket to the veneral Vindicator. Derakor felt no fear or pain or love. He felt only duty. He had but one job, protect the Temple of Zek. He and the guardians that served him had the simplest of orders. Defend or die. Recently, however, the voice of Rallos Zek gave him new orders. He was to once again serve in battle for the God of War. He must lead an assault against the Plane of Growth and defeat Tunare, herself.</p>

      <title>Chapter 19: The Test</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">81@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Loral remembered vividly the day his neighbors brought him to the church of Tunare and introduced him to Yeolaren. He and his father had often gone to the ceremonies that Yeolaren preceded over which had always intrigued the young lad. That day he felt nothing. The night before, while the rest of Felwithe slept, a demon came from the pits of Hate and stole his father away in their own house. Standing there on the cold marble floors of the church, facing the silver armored high priest of Tunare, Loral had never felt so alone in the world. Loral felt that exact same way when he stood deep in the Temple of Veeshan buried under millions of tons of rock and ice and looked into the large yellow eyes of Lendiniara the Keeper.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/keeper_2.jpg" title="Lendiniara the Keeper"><img src="./images/keeper_2_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Lendiniara the Keeper" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Two ancient white wurms and two smaller red drakes flanked the Keeper. Each one of these guardians held enough power to burn Felwithe to the ground in a matter of minutes but they were dwarfed in size and in power by Lendiniara. The ancient dragon of the western halls stood fourteen meters tall and more than fifty meters from tale to horn. Great winds blew Loral's green robes against him as Lendiniara stretched her great wings and quickly retracted them back to her sides. The fast movement of such a large creature seemed wholly impossible and Loral found his mind had trouble grasping what he had just seen.</p>

      <p>Images and words poured through Loral's head in a flood that soon relaxed as Lendiniara found the level of communication that Loral's mind was capable of handling. Loral saw a black stone doorway to the east of the ancient temple. Behind there, Lendiniara explained, Loral would be tested. He should expect to be tested in mind, body and spirit, the internal voice of Lendiniara continued, the testing halls had forged the mightiest warriors, priests and spellcasters that had ever dared to walk in front of the dragonkin, but most found only death or insanity.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/temple_of_veeshan.jpg" title="The Temple of Veeshan"><img src="./images/temple_of_veeshan_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Temple of Veeshan" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>As Loral walked slowly to the main halls of the Temple of Veeshan, past the wurms and drakes that had been guarding the halls since before the Elven nations had crossed the Ocean of Tears, he tried to remind himself what was at stake. Meeting the Coldain dwarves had shown Loral the tyranny of the giant nations of Kael Drakkal and luckily had revealed their plot against the Plane of Growth. Knowing of the long-standing wars between the giants and the dragons, Loral had hoped to seek their wisdom and strength to help him protect Tunare and her children. Loral's greatest wish would be to see a formal alliance between the Claws of Veeshan, guardians of this temple, and the Guardians of Tunare within the Plane of Growth. The combined power would be enough to defeat the giants for good and perhaps bring peace to many of Norrath's people. As Tunare's hand on Norrath, it would be Loral's greatest accomplishment to be the vehicle for this alliance. Perhaps then the pain of his actions would be removed.</p>

      <p>These thoughts left Loral's mind completely when he faced the black stone doorway that led to the Halls of Testing. Loral couldn't imagine what led past that door. Memories of Innoruuk's tug on his spirit and Trakanon's lifetime of solitude flowed past as he looked towards the ancient standard of the Claws imprinted on the door. For another few moments Loral stared at the symbol, then he placed his hand on the door and entered.</p>

      <p>A blast of hot air and smoke blew past Loral as he stepped into the halls of testing. The smell of sulfur burned his nose and the screams of claws scraping on stone sent chills up and down his back. Loral was in the center of a large U shaped room. The stone floors and walls had been blown smooth over thousands of years of erosion. Two stone staircases on either side led down to a large sunken room with three doors. Large gusts of hot wind blew against Loral, but one sight pushed him harder than any physical blast. Standing at the top of the south staircase was Sever Doomreaper.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/sever_and_loral.jpg" title="Loral and Sever Doomreaper"><img src="./images/sever_and_loral_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral and Sever Doomreaper" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral was very familiar with Sever's reputation and had even seen the shadowknight compete in a barbaric contest in the Arena in South Antonica. Sever was a mercenary of Innoruuk, offering his services to a variety of groups against a variety of foes for a variety of prices. His power both as a swordsman and as a practitioner of the dark arts were known to every regular drunk in every bar of Norrath. Loral had no doubt that these tales were true. Held loosely in one hand, blade pointed into the ground was Sever's blade, Innoruuk's Curse, a gift by the dark god for only his most faithful and powerful followers. Blackened armor covered in runes adorned his slender frame. Tucked under his arm was the mask of a demon, it's appearance alone a thing of nightmares. Seeing Loral's discomfort, Sever smiled.</p>

      <p>Loral was baffled by the confrontation. While he had no doubt in his faith to Tunare or the powers bestowed upon him, Loral also knew there was no way he would be able to defeat the dark knight. As if in answer to this thought, the voice of Lendiniara once again filled his mind.</p>

      <p>"All who choose to walk our halls are tested equally here. You, a cleric of light and this one a minion of darkness are two halves of a whole. Only while acting as one will you survive the tests"</p>

      <p>All became clear to Loral. Though the thought of such an alliance still disturbed him, he must work with Sever in order to defeat whatever beasts roamed these halls. Loral would have to use the powers of Tunare to heal a weapon of Innoruuk. Loral was aware that he and Sever were not alone. All around them, adventurers from all over Norrath stood and prepared to be tested. Before Loral could finish the thought, one of the three great doors opened and out stormed the first of hundreds of ancient guardian wurms that Loral would face with his new allies over the coming weeks. Loral placed his hand over the warden symbol of Tunare around his neck and whispered a prayer just as the first wave of fire hit the party.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/loral_with_wyverns.jpg" title="Loral in the towers of Skyshrine"><img src="./images/loral_with_wyverns_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral in the towers of Skyshrine" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Two moons later, Loral stepped out of the tower that separated the dragon city of Skyshrine from the gulf of the Cobalt Scar. His dark blue/green armor, forged and enchanted by the powerful Leoch sorcerers of the Claws, reflected the water in the gulf below. Though the battles had been more difficult than he could describe, Loral had gained much from the dragons during the testing. The trials had made enemies of friends and friends of enemies. He had found protection where he least expected and where he once had found solid ground had now become a vacuum. Loral had learned a valuable lesson, a lesson he had heard many times from his mentor Ciric but never fully understood until these recent battles. There was a great balance in the worlds of Norrath. A great balance that Loral must learn to utilize rather than to fight. Only by working within this balance could Loral hope to protect his friends and his God. It was a lesson that changed Loral forever.</p>

      </div>

      <p>A warm breeze glided through the quiet tree limbs, rustling leaves and sending a wave through the tall grass of the grove. Loral sat at the top of a small hill looking down at the wonders that only the presence of the Mother could create. Four tall white unicorns gently grazed upon the thick grass. Their wise and patient eyes beheld Loral as they chewed and for a moment all of Loral's past troubles left him. For a second he felt the true beauty of this place. He placed his hand on the earth below him and felt the energy of life that spread out from the tower, gateway to the Plane of Growth a short distance away. The energy spread through him and he exhaled feeling his tention flow out through him. Loral hadn't felt such peace in years. The sights, the sounds, the feelings, all blended together into one perfect experience.</p>

      <p>The far away clash of metal against metal brought him out of his trance and he remembered why he was here. A short few kelometers away, the Frost Giant war machine was in full production, preparing for a war with the minions of the Plane of Growth. Loral had scouted the area a few days earlier and had seen the enormous structures and great outposts that were being built. He knew that action had to come soon if the war was to be stopped.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/frost_giant_guards.jpg" title="Frost Giant Guards of the Doorway to Kael"><img src="./images/frost_giant_guards_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Frost Giant Guards of the Doorway to Kael" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>A half hour later, Loral stood outside of the eastern doorway to Kael Drakkal. Two guards stood outside the great stone cavern, their large weapons resting against the walls. Loral's thoughts turned around his plan for defeating the enormous foes, no easy task by himself, when he noticed a number of scarlet lines down the neck of one of the guards and a large dark puddle around it's feet. Taking out his gnomish scryer, he zoomed in on the giant's and saw the source of those trails. Dozens of arrows had the giant pinned to the wall behind him, it's lifeblood spilt to the ground below. Knowing the carefully planned deception would not last long, Loral hurried into the city.</p>

      <p>There was a great commotion just inside the city gates. Adventurers from all the great cities in Norrath stood ready, donned in the most spectacular armor and brandishing the greatest weapons in Norrath's history. Though the races of the hunters ranged from tiny gnomes to huge orgres, they all shared a symbol of a white flower upon their breasts. Loral recognized the symbol for the Cult of the Lotus, a powerful guild of hunters. Loral had battled beside them when their paths had crossed before and knew their great strength in such matters. The skill with which the giant guards had been slain was no longer a surprise to him.</p>

      <p>As Loral passed through them, he spotted Azile, dressed in the red robes of the Icicle, talking to a sharp eyed gnome mage. Azile turned and smiled at Loral. Loral suddenly felt the sting of a blade jabbed into his side. Turning quickly he beheld the slender figure and wide smile of Aleustria the Ranger. With a shout of excitement he embraced his old friend having not seen her since their travels in the lands of Kunark many seasons earlier. From the incredibly fine chain armor and the glowing blades in her hands, it was obvious that life had been good for her since joining the Cult. Before they could spend any more time reminiscing. The attack began.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/vindicator.jpg" title="The battle of Derekor the Vindicator."><img src="./images/vindicator_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The battle of Derekor the Vindicator." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral had never witnessed such an attack. Giants were confronted and slaughtered before he had time to speak one prayer. Kromrif guards burst into ash from the powerful spells of the great wizards. Within minutes, the team stood outside the northern arena of Kael, lair of the great Clerics of Zek and pathway to the Church of the war god. With little delay the clerics that had caused Loral such concern were dragged out into the courtyard and cut down. They were of little concern to the Lotus Cult who had only two targets in mind for this attack.</p>

      <p>An agile monk of the party, known for his ability to draw out attackers from any position using many arts of deception ran to the north down a long icy bridge. The warriors stood ready, their healers behind them prepared to heal the great wounds they would soon face. Seconds later the monk returned and on his heel was the sole guardian of Zek himself, Derekor the Vindicator.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/travelers_home.jpg" title="Loral in Felwithe"><img src="./images/travelers_home_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral in Felwithe" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Three weeks later, Loral was back in Felwithe in the chambers of his teacher, Yeloaren. Loral described the fall of not only the priests of Zek and even the mighty Vindicator, but also of the very king of Kael himself, King Vlantious Tormax. The Vindicator was only half of the goal of Lotus Cult that day, Loral explained. In one single attack, the entire political structure of Kael from both the religious sect and the royal court had fallen. Thurgadin was safe and the war against Growth had been quickly forgotten.</p>

      <p>"This is a great victory, my friend. It is these selfless actions you have taken that has led to this day. Tunare has smiled upon you and upon us all. It is your action in these matters that has led the Church and the Court of Felwithe to ask once again for your service in another matter." Yeolaren spoke carefully, Loral noticed. "The wizard Al'Kabor has released a gateway to the moon of Luclin. As we speak, agents of all known empires are traveling to these unknown lands. The Court is concerned with what may be found up there and what may find us should it choose to travel back down. We need those faithful to the Church to learn more of these lands. Your skills in the matters of Velious show you to be the perfect choice."</p>

      <p>Loral knew there was more not being said. While his victory in defending the Plane of Growth was not in doubt, his past actions had placed them in an uncomfortable situation. The Court of Felwithe was never comfortable with his alliance with the Claws of Veeshan and the Church of Tunare had not forgotten the death of Idoru and his fall into the hands of Innoruuk. Sending him so far away was a perfect situation for them. They stood much to gain from the new world and little to lose should he fail.</p>

      <p>Loral quickly dismissed much of these thoughts when he remembered his reason for being here. Had Felwith thought so little of him there is no way they would give him the gift he was about to receive. Should he still be dark to Tunare's eye, She would simply not allow it. He took in a deep breath to reduce his nervousness as he and Yeloaren walked down into the main halls of the Church of Felwithe. Together they stood at the large oak doors that lead to the first church of Tunare. Yeloaren put a hand on his shoulder, as he had done decades earlier when Loral first swore his oath to Tunare and became an acolite in her service. The door opened and at the head of the church stood the council of the Church, the chancellor of the Court of Paladins and King Tearis Thex himself. Loral stood straight and prepared himself to swear his oath again, this time as a High Priest of Tunare.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/cobalt_scar.jpg" title="Cobalt Scar"><img src="./images/cobalt_scar_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Cobalt Scar" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Cold ice blew against the cliff that overlooked Cobalt Scar. On a large rock nearby, the sorceress Azile mediated. Loral, holding his cloaks tight against him from the chilling wind, climbed the rock and sat next to her. She wore a golden robe this day, adorned with the symbol of a white lotus. Though somewhat concerned by the unknown motives of the Cult of the Lotus, Loral was still happy for Azile's acceptance into the selective group. Likewise, Azile smiled when she saw the symbol of a High Priest of Tunare that hung around Loral's neck next to the tooth of Trakanon. The brightness of the moon of Luclin above them seemed to grab their attention at the same time and they both turned to gaze upon it.</p>

      <p>"The world will never be the same now," Azile said coldly. "Who knows what evils that meddling megalomaniac Al'Kabor has done to us."</p>

      <p>Even with her distaste for the well known wizard, Loral could feel her excitment of exploring whatever wonders were unveiled within that alien land. In a few short days, they would travel to the Nexus for the first time, and as Azile had stated, the world would never be the same.</p>

<p>Bonescar was happy with his new life. Ever since his escape from the Runnyeye goblin's gladiator with the help of his new employer, Loral Ciriclight the priest, he had nothing but good drink, hearty food and extra coin for his purse. Loral taught the large barbarian the trade of the merchant, a long way from his original trade as a future corpse of the cheering bloodthirsty goblins. He now had a keen eye for what was truly a mighty weapon of ancient times and what was better used to poke a rat. He served his master well and in turn had begun to build a life for himself. But that night it all ended with a dark blade stabbing him through his back.</p>

      <p>The dark elf pulled the blade free and wiped the blood on the wolf cloak still held in the barbarian's arms. Quickly he cut free the man's purse, only to toss it down a deep crack in the wall. He had no use for the dead man's possessions, save for one item. Within seconds, he found the heavy object. The icy eyes of the assassin gleamed when he saw how successful this hunt had been. The sounds of footsteps and the red-purple glow of torchlight brought him back to the moment. Stepping back into the shadows, he disappeared from sight.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/faydark_spires.jpg" title="The spires of Greater Faydark."><img src="./images/faydark_spires_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The spires of Greater Faydark." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral Ciriclight stood at the center of the ancient spires. He watched the Nexus Scion, a beautiful high elf dressed in the white apprentice robes of Al'Kabor's wizard school, her blue eyes fixed and focused. Loral felt the ground begin to rumble and a great humming filled his head, rattling his teeth and weakening his knees. White glowing clouds drifted from the ground around them and a white sphere began spinning around the large spires. Then with a flash, he was gone.</p>

      <p>The great forest of Greater Faydark was replaced with the dark stone rock of a large cavern. Loral and the other travelers stood on a large platform surrounded by four spires just like those he had left. The platform sat upon a huge black rock chipped in thousands of places and vibrating with a huge internal power. Four stairways led down the great rock and into caverns beyond and to the nearby city of Shadowhaven. There was no doubt, Loral was far from home.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/nexus.jpg" title="The Nexus"><img src="./images/nexus_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Nexus" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>For his short stay in Shadowhaven, Loral discovered the general disdain the residents had for 'outlanders'. Loral spent little of his time talking and much of it listening to the rumors of workers and nobles in Shadowhaven's inns. He heard tales of the caverns that led to the surface and after replenishing his supplies and donning the blue armor of the dragonkin, he crossed the great bridge of the underground city and into the dark caverns of Paludal.</p>

      <p>Loral spent two days slowly navigating through the dense Paludal Caverns. Just outside of the gates of shadowhaven, bandits and thieves had set up a small and run-down village held at bay by the sharp blades of the powerful Shadowhaven guard. The caverns evolved into large worn stone, blasted away by the currents of large underground rivers. Great shelled beasts and small humanoids with skin of thick fungus glared at his passing but did not attack, though their smell alone was almost enough to fell the cleric. Soon the caverns opened up and Loral stepped carefully outside onto the beach that circled Hollowshade Moore.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/shadowhaven_gates.jpg" title="The Gates of Shadowhaven"><img src="./images/shadowhaven_gates_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Gates of Shadowhaven" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>The site was one of the most beautiful Loral had ever seen. Waves of a crystal clear lake gently washed upon the pure white sand of the beach. The very sound of the water soothed the ache of the caverns behind him. Green hills stretched beyond the beach to the west and far off he could see the lights and smoke of torchlight and campfires. That is when the light above caught his attention and he looked up to view the huge sphere of Norrath.</p>

      <p>Loral lost his balance and would have slipped into the water below if he hadn't steadied himself on the wall. The feeling of hanging upside down above his homelands was so strong it took the strength from him. Feeling suffocated, Loral pulled off his helmet and dropped it to the ground. No site he had seen upon this moon truly made him understand his position until he stood staring at the very lands he had lived on thousands of miles above him.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/hollowshade_cave.jpg" title="Hollowshade Moore."><img src="./images/hollowshade_cave_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Hollowshade Moore." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Returning to his present situation, he hoped to find shelter among those camps ahead. Thinking it a perfect opportunity to try his latest possession, a gift of the lady Dahlea and the priestess Wrenne, he drew the white bridal, clasped with the symbol of Tunare, out from his soft leather pack and held it at arms length. He closed his eyes and remembered the words of activation.</p>

      <p>"Come Illumina"</p>

      <p>An unearthly air spun around Loral and his arms and a great white mare stepped from the swirling grey mist. It's head filled the muzzle of the bridle and in seconds, Loral found himself next to the beautiful creature. The great beast stood with the nobility that only a creature of Tunare could have. Loral stood in awe. Almost impatiently, the horse turned and nudged Loral with its muzzle. Loral smiled, mounted the beautiful horse and the two sped off to the firelight ahead.</p>

      <p>Little did he know of the murder of his friend, and little did he know of the dangers to follow.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">84@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Chilled air blew through the deep caverns as Loral and his friends stepped out of the mouth of the cave that led to the barren plains of Marus Seru. Ahead of them, great ridges fed into canyons hundreds of meters deep. Quivous, the armored bard, stepped forward and Loral followed close. Behind Loral were Juror, Wrenne and Raom. Each highly respected elders of Healers United and mighty adventurers.</p>

      <p>Quivous's magical songs of travel held the party high above the great gorges of the broken land. A misstep climbing the steep ridges would mean death, but floating high above them, the party was safe. Looking down, Loral could make out the giant blue isects that crawled within the gorge. Loral shivered as his feet stepped upon illusionary walkways while they traveled deeper into the barren land.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/spire_pillar.jpg"><img src="./images/spire_pillar_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Climbing over a steep ridge, the party beheld the great broken artifact. A huge stone platform stood on giant arcing columns of granite that burrowed deep into the rock like great worms. The platform stood hundreds of meters above the earth and was penetrated through the center by the spike of a steep mountain peak. At each corner was a grey runed spire the same proportions of the wizard spires of Norrath but much larger. One of the four had broken and lay deep in the canyon below, shattered from the great fall.</p>

      <p>Loral had learned of the existence of this monument through gossip and rumor. Though many of the drunkards of various inns had little information of worth, one elderly bar maiden told Loral a tale passed to her by her grandfather. According to her story, the great wizards of Seru, known as the Eye, attempted to construct the largest teleportation spire ever created, building it upon this mighty platform over a twenty year period. When finished, the great wizards of the Eye of Seru tore open the fabric of time and space to activate the great spires, but something went horribly wrong.</p>

      <p>The great energy of the spires collapsed and exploded, sending one of the burning spires plummeting to the canyon below. Some wizards were simply blown to pieces, others were transported to some unknown reaches of the universe damned to unknown hells. The deformed clawed hands of extra-planiar beasts reached from the abyss and tore others to shreds. Many powerful wizards had their spirits stripped free of their bodies, forever to walk in two planes of existance with life in neither. Hundreds of years later, the barmaiden told Loral, the spirits of the damned wizards still haunted the spires seeking answers and vengeance.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/spire_staircase.jpg"><img src="./images/spire_staircase_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral pointed his traveling companions to the base of the canyon wall below the platform. There, a small cave led into the mountain that pierced into the platform. Blades drawn and spells ready, the party entered the cave. A few meters in the cave widened into a giant circular cavern. The center held a great pillar and spiral walkway leading far above the floor. All along the outskirts of the cavern stood spirits of the damned wizards, now guardians of the abomination.</p>

      <p>With great speed the party was engulfed under the blacked robed figures. Icy etherial claws tore at the party. The chilling touch of the horrors turned Raom's skin grey and Loral began his prayers to Tunare to cure his longtime friend. Back to back, the party made their way to the staircase in order to fight the spirits one at a time. Loral grasped the warden symbol of Tunare around his neck and the earth below reached up and held the spirits to the ground. Quivous's harmony lent great strength to the blades of himself and Raom while Juror's spiritual chants stole the speed from their attackers. Wrenne splayed her fingers and a blinding star of fire tore through one of the spectres, bursting it into flame.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/spire_fight.jpg"><img src="./images/spire_fight_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Gaining the high ground, the party moved quickly up the staircase, paralyzing each creature in turn until they were able to focus on defeating the spirit. Raom's bladed axe, a Wurmslayer of Kunark, drove through the dusty robes and landed solidly in the etherial body of the spirits. Loral turned his hand from the spells of healing into the judgement of Tunare's wrath, blasting down another of the horrid spectres with unyielding energy. Soon the party had worked up the stairs to the upper platform but instead of a break in the onslaught the party faced even greater numbers.</p>

      <p>The eternal voices of torment filled the heads of the weary adventurers as the spirits attacked. Feeling the battle turning against them, Wrenne prepared to open a gateway far away to the lands of Norrath where they might escape with their lives. Quivous, quick to find solutions to such odds, began a different chant. This one a slow melody that turned the attentions of the spirits away from tearing the party to shreds. Their voices calmed as memories of their lives flowed into them through the haunting chant. Quickly capitalizing on the turn of battle, the rest of the adventures cut down the spirits with spell and blade. Soon they stood in the empty room, the tattered robes of their foes at their feet.</p>

      <p>The adventurers passed through an archway onto the open platform, facing the true guardian of the destroyed portal, the Spire Lord. It stood taller than any of the spectres they faced and instead of an eternal blackness staring out from under the dark hood, twin red eyes pierced into the very souls of those who met it's gaze. A steel crown, that of an arch-wizard of Seru, adorned the head of the century old creature. With an etherial growl, more felt than heard, the beast attacked.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/spirelord.jpg"><img src="./images/spirelord_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Raom stunned the spectre with a quick slam of his shield and a powerful chant to his diety, Errolisi Marr. Juror cursed the creature, calling fourth the great powers of ancient mystics and stealing the lord's strength. Wrenne surrounded the party with translucent blades of energy that bit into the spiritual beast with each swing of it's horrible invisible claws. Quivous sung songs of war as he cut into the creature. Loral surrounded Raom with a celestial pool of light, healing his wounds as they appeared and protecting him from the cold touch of death. They fought in perfect sequence, each member an extension of the party in perfect unison. Though never having faced such a creature in battle, it was little match for the battle hardened Healers. With a final cut of Raom's blade, the spirit screamed across two planes of existence and fell to the platform's surface.</p>

      <p>Three weeks later, Wrenne met Loral on the second floor of a small inn near Shadowhaven. Loral had been preparing a report to the Church of Tunare outlining the events. Wrenne smiled at the strict scripture and Loral's attention to details, it would seem even the wilds of Luclin hadn't removed his sense of discipline in the matters of the church. They talked about what they had seen at length, it was clear that while they had seen first hand the results of Seru's attempt, the full result of the catastrophic event was unknown. Loral had heard of spectral minions of other planes walking within caverns under Luclin. Rumors of the return of the slavemasters of the Iksar had also been overheard. There were many great dangers on Luclin, and with the Nexus now in operation, those dangers could soon face Norrath. Loral had much yet to discover.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It was the darkest day for the elves of Tunaria. For hundreds of years they had known a great prosperity and a great peace. The high elven city of Takish-Hiz was known across all of Norrath as a pillar of strength and honor. Outside, the wood elven glades of Eldarr Forest held the greatest wonders of nature, a true monument to Tunare. But the jealousy of a demi-god destroyed it all. Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince, twisted the spine of the lands, turning forest into desert and mountains to dust. The elves fought valiantly but poverty, plague and war broke their spirits. The great demon, Ixiblat Fur, killed thousands before the great wizards banished him back to the Plane of Fire. The elves watched as all they had known and loved turned to death and sadness. With the loss of hundreds of years of prosperity, they built ships of their remaining trees and sailed across the great blue sea, known years later as the ocean of tears.</p>

      <p>Loral sat in the sulfuric baking caverns of the late Lord Nagafen. Now assisting the priests of the Triumverate, Loral had tracked down the last of those who wished to once again release the demon-god, Solusek Ro. In a great battle, Loral prevented the release of Ixiblat Fur and broken the Sarnak circle of sorcerers who attempted his summoning. Now only a traveling merchant, Zordak Ragefire, remained. Loral had heard of the merchant's passing through these corridors, and traveled to the underground lair of the dragon, Nagafen, to confront the agent of Ro. A week earlier, Loral had infiltrated the compound of fire giants that protected the lair and now he camped in the cavern itself, surviving on the sustenance his powerful armor of the draconian priest, Akkirus, provided. The great gasses of the rivers of lava stung Loral's lungs and clouded his mind. He wondered if he would even have the strength to battle Ragefire, should the time come. For days he fell in and out of consciousness, dreaming of wonders and horrors alike.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/zhia_2.jpg" title="Lady of the Heart"><img src="./images/zhia_2_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Lady of the Heart" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Loral woke to the strange light glowing in the center of the cavern. His eyes had grown accustom to the red glow of this hall, so this new blue light grabbed his attention immediately. He sat up, reaching for his shield and grasping tight his warden symbol of Tunare. In the center of the room stood a figure, armored in violet and carrying twin blades sparkling with energy. She was a wood elf, shorter than Loral in stature but carrying herself with an air of authority and nobility Loral had never seen. Loral found it hard to breathe, and when she turned to behold him, he had no doubt of her divine nature. She was an angel of Tunare, the Lady of the Heart.  She called herself Zhia.</p>

      <p>Zhia smiled and sat with Loral for a short while, discussing the matters of Solusek Ro's plots as though she had witnessed the history herself.  Her voice was that of a perfectly tuned harp, it's sound soothing the aches of this place and clearing his clouded mind and spirit. For a short time she stayed with Loral, but eventually stood to leave. Before he could stammer out his thanks at the visit, she drew a small wrapped package from a belt pouch. Loral accepted the package and watched as she touched one of her jeweled rings and disappeared in a burst of energy. Loral opened the small package, smiled, and bit into one of the tasty gnome shaped cookies.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/ragefire.jpg" title="Ragefire"><img src="./images/ragefire_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Lady of the Heart" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>It had been five years since Loral and his friends had broken Ragefire's ruse and defeated the hidden dragon. Loral had just returned to the forest of Greater Faydark after one of his adventures in Luclin to hear the announcement of a great contest of casters and priests to be held in the Arena. Loral never found much interest in these contests, but something drove him to travel far to the planes of the Karanas and to ride Illumina south to the great Arena of Antonica. During his ride, he tried to find the source of this drive. Was it simple curiosity, or some darker splinter from Innoruuk's previous hold on his spirit?</p>

      <p>A few days later, Loral found himself inside the great arena. Around him stood the mightiest priests and spellcasters Norrath had ever seen. Loral found a group of his friends from Lotus Cult and they quickly prepared to work together in the chaotic contest to follow. With some short instructions by the organizers of the great event, the gates slammed shut and the horns of battle sounded.</p>

      <p>The bolts of lightning and bursts of fire could be seen fifty miles away. The powers of the greatest casters tore open the fabric of space and time, bringing down hails of ice and tearing the ground open to swallow it's victims. Loral quickly ran for cover as tons of rock hurled itself through the air and waves of plague blew through the crowds. He stepped off of the central platform and moved towards one of the outside spires when what he beheld knocked him to his knees.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/solusek_ro.jpg" title="Solusek Ro"><img src="./images/solusek_ro_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Solusek Ro" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Walking casually through the crowd was the visage of the Burning Prince, Solusek Ro himself. The sounds of the explosions around him drifted away as a thousand years of history filled Loral's mind. He beheld the twenty foot avatar and remembered the stories his father had told him of the plight of the elves and the sorrow of leaving their great homeland of Tunaria. He remembered the cruelty of Ixiblat Fir burning the armies of noble paladins into ash. Loral gasped for words and stood on unstable legs as his anger built. Suddenly, Loral felt strong arms pull him aside as a column of fire burst from the ground where he had stood. Under one arm of the barbarian shaman, he was carried behind one of the great claw-like spires of the Arena as the battle raged around him.</p>

<p>The great battle raged around his party as they defended their small alcove.  The mighty Lotus Cultian wizards sent great shards of ice tearing through the arena while the healing powers of the shaman and druids closed gaping wounds and soothed charred skin.  Loral's mind was still clouded with the image of the burning prince.  Of all loral had expected at this barbaric display, he had no idea he would come face to face with the focal point for the end of the great elven nations.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/zhia.jpg" title="Lady of the Heart"><img src="./images/zhia_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Lady of the Heart" /></a>
      </div>
<p>The minutes stretched as long as days under the stress of the great battle.  Great horns had blown, signaling a final battle in the center of the arena.  Loral and his remaining partners moved quickly to the raised platform.  Loral could not find the avatar of Ro, but what he did see shocked him almost as much.  There, walking casually through the final strife of the great war, twin blades glimmering with a life all their own, was the Lady of the Heart.  Waves of fire rolled over her without even a blemish on her soft skin.  Her eyes flashed as bolts of lightning broke open the ground in front of her, though she didn't even blink.  Her green elven eyes turned and beheld Loral's pale blue.  His heart stopped and he fell to his knees in humility and reverence.  Zhia winked and smiled.</p>

<p>A week had passed.  Loral had traveled back to the lands of Luclin, far above Norrath, but each night he spent in the small room on the second-floor inn he thought of that day.  Many dangers Loral had heard rumors of during his travels, many possible threats to assess and deliver to the Church of Felwithe.  But that day, he had been driven to witness the calling of the dark god, Solusek Ro.  That day he had seen the angelic protector of the elves, as he had while hunting the agent of Ro, Ragefire.  What purpose for the event was still unexplained, but Loral would not take lightly what he had seen.  His eyes would be open for possible signs of further explanation.  And he could only hope and pray to see the vision of Zhia, Lady of the Heart, once again.</p>

<p>Understanding a species requires an understanding of its history. This parchment discusses the main turning points of the great Iksar Empire, from her rise of imperial power to her fall into darkness.</p>

      <p><strong>The Shissar</strong></p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/cazic_hand.jpg" title="Monument to Cazic Thule built by the Shissar"><img src="./images/cazic_hand_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Monument to Cazic Thule built by the Shissar" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>No one knows where they came from or how long they were in power, but historians have no doubt that the great empire of the Shissar was powerful indeed. Quite possibly shaping much of Norrath's culture and planting the seeds of much that exists today. They were devastating and vile, torturing souls for no other reason than their own pleasure and driving the largest slave army ever built to the brink of death and starvation.</p>

      <p>Their monuments are rare, for the Shissar paid little homage to their god, Cazic Thule. Only two great stone hands protruding from the swamp of Innothule show their acknowledgment of the diety. As their power grew, so did their vanity. They renounced Cazic Thule and proclaimed themselves walking gods upon Norrath. They drove the Iksar slaves harder then ever and brought the lizard-people to the brink of extinction.</p>

      <p><strong>Freedom of the Green Mist</strong></p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/iksar_statues_fv.jpg" title="Statue of the Iksar in Fironia Vie"><img src="./images/iksar_statues_fv_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Statue of the Iksar in Fironia Vie" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Then came the Green Mist. Unknown in origin, many believe it to be a plague engineered by the fiendish alchamists of Cazic Thule in his poisoned plane of Fear. A tool of revenge against his lost children, it was released upon Norrath seeking out the Shissar alone among the enormous slave population. The Shissar's whip wielding hands fell and soon the slave races found themselves without masters. The Shissar had been wiped off the face of Norrath forever and freedom was given to a race that had known nothing but torment.</p>

      <p>For many years the Iksar wandered Kunark, seeking shelter and food. They began to form small packs, which formed larger tribes. After six decades, these tribes numbered five - the Kunzar, the Obulus, the Jarsath, the Kylong and the Nathsar. Feuds and skirmishes between the five tribes tore much of Kunark apart. Some shaman of the Iksar tapped into the powers of their original master, the god Cazic Thule, and their power grew. Others began delving into the darker arts left behind by the Shissar and others practiced hand to hand combat as an art.</p>

      <p>Than one stepped outside of the tribes, stronger and smarter than all the others. He alone held the power to unite them, and unite them he did. The young warrior of the Kunzar, Venril Sathir, knew the key to uniting the tribes. He taught them patriotism. For only in the love of their species, the love of their society as Iksar united, would they be able to unite. And thus the empire was born.</p>

      <p><strong>Emperor Venril Sathir</strong></p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/iksar_statues_fm.jpg" title="Statue of the Iksar in Frontier Mountains"><img src="./images/iksar_statues_fm_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Statue of the Iksar in Frontier Mountains" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Venril Sathir's empire grew quickly. Great monuments were built, embedding a great pride in all the Iksar and inspiring fear in all those who would oppose the huge empire. Cities of grand scale were built by the Iksar's goblin and giant slaves. Venril Sathir wed the eldest daughter of the Obulus wizards, Druzilla, and together they built the greatest empire ever known.</p>

      <p>But Sathir was not sated. Discovering a dark tome of necromancy, said to be one of the original texts left from the Shissar, Venril Sathir began a ritual to grant him immortality. Knowing of this dark corruption, Venril's eldest son, Rile Sathir, interrupted the dark ritual and destroyed the body of Venril Sathir, burying all evidence in the tomb of Charasis.</p>

      <p><strong>Emperor Rile Sathir</strong></p>

      <p>Soon after being crowned, Rile Sathir continued to open the Iksar nation to prosperity. While Venril used the honor of the Iksar as a weapon, Rile used the water. Under his command, a great navy was built, larger than any Norrath has ever seen since. Led by Rile's weaponsmaster, Vlzk Irontail, the navy knew no dangers and no bounds. The Iksar became the richest nation upon all of Norrath. Rile's land army was as formidable as his navy and he soon built a massive slave army of goblins and giants. Only one race was left unruled on Kunark - the dragons.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/iksar_guardians.jpg" title="Guardians of Cabilis"><img src="./images/iksar_guardians_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Guardians of Cabilis" /></a>
		</div>
      <p>The Ring of Scale, an ancient order of great dragons upon Kunark, understood the threat of this growing empire and their leader, Jaled Dar, acted upon it. They sent fourth an agent of Scale, one known for his viscousness and ruthless nature. While the Iksar empire was large, the great circle of wyrms knew only one agent would be required. Swooping out of the great caverns of Veeshan's Peaks flew the powerful green dragon, Trakanon.</p>

      <p>It was said that a great storm destroyed the armada of Rile Sathir, but other historians know differently. Standing from the bow of his greatest warship, Rile pondered the strange messages his network of sages had given him, feelings of terror and confusion from the other ships of his armada. He looked out over the great sea into the vast waves of the storm around him. In the distance, a great wave traveled in the wrong direction and at its crest flew the enormous Trakanon. Giant arrows the size of trees were fired from the ballista of Rile's ship, tearing through the leathery wings of the huge beast. Trakanon flew only a few feet above the ship and crashed down onto Rile's sister ship, breaking the hull in half with its great claws. Balls of fire and storms of electricity raked over the dragon but Trakanon was relentless. He turned and breathed a great cloud of acidic gas upon the ship's deck, killing scores of the crew instantly.</p>

      <p>Rile watched as his weaponsmaster, Vlzk Irontail, leapt onto the back of the powerful wyrm and crushed the beast's ribs with a great swing of his steel tail. Twisting too fast to see, Trakanon plucked off the heroic Iksar and bit him in half. With the grin of a thousand teeth, Trakanon leapt onto Rile's own ship and faced the soon-dead emperor of the Iksar.</p>

      <p>The battle was quick but its scale enormous. In the great battle, Rile Sathir's armada was sunk and Rile himself was lost at sea. While single handedly destroying the largest navy of Norrath's history, Trakanon himself was mortally wounded and crawled into a deep cave to prepare to die.</p>

      <p><strong>Emperor Atrebe Sathir</strong></p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/dar_skull.jpg" title="The Skull of Jalid-Dar"><img src="./images/dar_skull_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Skull of Jalid-Dar" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Rile's eldest son, Atrebe Sathir, unprepared for his inheritance to the empire, drew upon the dark powers of the Shissar legends and magiks for his source of power. Buried deep in his labs along with the greatest Iksar alchemists, he began experiments in breeding. His first result was a race of dragon-like soldiers called the Sarnak, powerful warriors and spellcasters used as fodder for his army. His second more successful breed was a great flying mount called Sokokar, a cross-breed of froglok and dragon. With this powerful new weapon, Atrebe builds an air force of winged knights, able to battle with the dragons of the sky.</p>

      <p>A great fifty four year war breaks out between Atrebe's armies and the Ring of Scale. Great devastation fell upon Kunark as drakes and wurms scorch the earth and tear apart the once great cities. In a final great battle, high above Cabilis, Atrebe himself battles the queen of Scale, Jaled Dar herself. In the greatest display of magic ever seen by mortals, the two embraced in combat, both destroying themselves in a huge column of fire over a mile wide. All that remained of the battle was the great crater known as the Field of Bone and the skull of Jaled-Dar, fallen leader of the Ring of Scale.</p>

      <p><strong>The Fall of the Empire</strong></p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/sebilis_statues.jpg" title="The Ruins of Sebilis"><img src="./images/sebilis_statues_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Ruins of Sebilis" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>With no heir to the throne and much of their military in waste, the Iksar once again found themselves fragmented. The rebellious slave armies of goblins, giants and Sarnak broke apart the mighty empire, sending the bulk of the Iksar people to the port city of Cabilis.</p>

      <p>From a poisoned grave, the once great agent of Scale, Trakanon, arose. His soul had been stripped from the rotting husk of his body, a price he paid for vengeance against the Iksar. The Ring of Scale, now led by Phara-Dar turned the dead dragon away, marking him a traitor for his descent into the dark arts but with the aid of the freed Froglok slaves, Trakanon destroyed the last sorcerers of Sebilis and claimed the ancient city as his own lair.</p>

      <p><strong>Sathir the Lich King</strong></p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/overthere.jpg" title="Crypt in the Overthere"><img src="./images/overthere_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Crypt in the Overthere" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Rumors spread that the legendary emperor of the Iksar, Venril Sathir, had returned from the dead, his attempt at immortality partially successful. He raised a powerful army of lycanthropic warriors, the Drolvargs, and overtook the feeble forces that held the fortress of the wizard Karnor. Sathir's bride, Druzilla, was buried along with her servants and protectors in the tomb of the once great city of Charasis. It was said the howls of the damned could be heard throughout the canyons, giving it the name Howling Stones to adventurers who crossed its path.</p>

      <p>Today, the Iksar continue to rebuild their once great empire one day at a time. Few know of the motivation of the lich-king Venril Sathir or his budding army of werewolves. Few know of the City of Mist or of Cabilis, and few know what the dracholiche Trakanon desires. It is rich hunting for the mighty adventurer and rich lore for the historians who dare to explore the ancient and lucrative ruins. Though of dubious morality, little can argue with the might of the once great Iksar empire.</p>

      <title>Chapter 25: The Grey</title>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Jolain Goldenleaf stared out over the wastelands of the Grey. The vacuum of the land pulled his skin tight against his face and only the magical protection of his amulet kept his lungs from exploding in his chest. A long lock of his jet black hair fell across his scarred face. Dirt and grime covered the normal shine of his masterfully crafted and highly magical armor, a gift from the Coldain Dwarves for his services in their war against Kael Drakkal. His blade, the golden runed outer-planiar blade Nature's Defender, was caked with the acidic blood and clay of the burrowing worms, timeless golems, and skeletal slaves put in the land by their vile masters an eternity earlier.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/sshraeshza.jpg"><img src="./images/sshraeshza_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Ssraeshza" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>For a month Jolain had traveled to the vast wastelands of the Grey and for two weeks he had carved through the unliving creatures of the dead land. Five score of the beasts had fallen under his blade and Jolain was able to heal his wounds with the prayers of Tunare. For two weeks he fought outside the massive pyramid in the center of the wasteland learning much of the ancient snake-people and their minions.</p>

      <p>Jolain felt the ground tremble beneath his feet. In an instant Jolain's blade came up in time to parry a huge stone arm swinging inches away from his golden helmed head. The strength of the blow sent Jolain to the ground, but he swung hard at the beasts legs. The fine edge of Nature's Defender cut five inches into stone leg of the beast. The rockfiend, a faceless mass of rocks and shimmering ore held together by an unnatural magnetic bond, swung a massive fist and connected solidly with Jolain's chest blasting the breath from his magically filled lungs. Another swing smashed Jolain's head and sent his helmet spinning to the ground. Jolain's vision darkened into a fading tunnel and he felt a stream of warmth flow from the side of his head as he fell to the ground unconscious.</p>
      <!-- DIRECTORS CUT!!  p>Loral woke violently, sitting up in his bed and clutching the symbol of Tunare around his neck. The dream that woke him faded quickly from his mind as he reoriented himself to his surroundings. An hour later, Loral was bathed and dressed in his green robes, but far from rested. For three days he paced inside his small apartment the memories of dragons, giants, pain and fire filling his head instead of the cool waters and shady trees of his homeland. While he could remove himself for a short time from the constant dangers of the lands he explored, it seemed that he could not remove them from himself. Perhaps he was now a creature of the wild, a minion of the environment battling for survival. Relief from the dark thoughts came in the form of a young acolite of the Church who greeted him and escorted him to Yeolarin's meeting chambers.</p -->
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/church_of_felwithe.jpg"><img src="./images/church_of_felwithe_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Church of Felwithe" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Two weeks and a planet away, Loral entered the small office of Yeolarin Bronzeleaf, high priest of Felwithe. Yeolarin sat at a small table covered with many dishes of the fine foods of the church. On his left sat Tynkael, a leutenant of the Paladin's guild, and on his right sat a dark haired high elf wearing the deep red robes of an elder spellcaster but from which guild Loral couldn't guess. Yeolarin stood and embraced Loral then asked him about his travels in Luclin. The chit chat ended quickly when Leutenant Tynkael cleared his throat and Yeolarin bade Loral to sit. A plate of food was placed in front of Loral, though he mainly pushed it around as they talked.</p>

      <p>The same time Loral was sent to Luclin, Leutenant Tynkael explained, an agent of the Paladins guild was sent to gather information on the threat of the Shissar. Shortly after reporting of his journey to the Grey contact with the agent had stopped. Yeolarin took over the conversation and explained that the church had agreed to send someone to travel to Luclin and track down this lost paladin.</p>

      <p>Loral found the story ironic. The dangers of Luclin were well known and Loral was far from surprised to hear someone had gone missing. The paladin had most likely been killed by any number of horrors. To send a priest to rescue a single soldier didn't make much sense but Loral knew the loyalty of Felwithe. Even Loral was shocked by his own negativity towards the plight of the soldier. Loral looked to his longtime master, the high priest Yeolarin, and accepted the assignment.</p>
      <!-- p>Soon after his meeting Loral gathered his belongings, old friends from his days of adventure. He folded and packed away his robes and strapped on the blue shimmering chestplate of Akkirus feeling it form around him. From his locked chest he took out the Water Sprinkler of Nem Ahnk, the gift of the Triumverate avatar, and Illumina's rope bridle. Wrapped in a green cloth was his latest magical possession, a wonderous gift from the heirophant Skrabbit of Lotus Cult, the Faithstone of Nature. The carved idol could transport him directly to the church of Tunare from anywhere in Norrath. Since accepting it, Loral would never again have to be far from home, though such a place seemed to be slipping away.</p -->

      <p>Two days later in the underground city of Shadowhaven, Loral met his friends and fellow members of Healers United; Juror Truespirit the powerful Shaman of the Tribunal, Raom Spirithealer the battle-hardened Paladin of Marr, Cymil Sylvanshot the graceful and deadly ranger, and Wrenne Celtes the fierce druid of Tunare.  Loral felt at home again among his old friends, relaxed and excited at their future adventure.</p>

      <p>For two weeks the party traveled through the abandoned tunnels of Netherbian's Lair, the hilly grasslands of Dawnshroud Peaks, the barren plains of Marus Seru and the dangerous canyons of Mons Letalis. Before they knew it they stood staring into the howling mouth of the cavern to the Grey. The next morning the adventurers put on their magical rings, necklaces and cloaks of enduring breath and stepped past the shimmering barrier that contained the vacuum of the Grey.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/ssraeshza.jpg"><img src="./images/ssraeshza_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Ssraeshza's Temple" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>The adventurers moved cautiously through the cave and into an ancient crypt.  While magical air filled their lungs, the vacuum removed all sound from the space around them. The eerie silence drew many concerned looks between the party as they climbed the stairs and stepped outside into the great wasteland of the Grey. All around them the cracked earth was split apart by giant rocks that seemed to fall from the bright blue sky above. Great hulking beasts made of stone and clay lumbered between the fallen rocks. The party made its way carefully among the fallen rocks and over a large ridge. There they saw the temple of Ssraeshza.</p>

      <p>Loral could feel the screams of a thousand generations of torment when his eyes beheld the horrific temple. To see such a construction in the center of such a desolate land was terrifying enough, but the dark aura of the place chilled the companions to the bone. Quietly the party walked closer to the finely crafted walls of the temple, built by the hands of a thousand skeletal slaves.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/shissar_revenant.jpg"><img src="./images/shissar_revenant_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Shissar Revenants" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Without warning the Revenants attacked, their rotten serpentine bodies pushing them quickly across the ground. Loral gasped in horror when one of the beasts de-hinged its jaw to clamp down on his throat, but Loral was saved when the great stone blade of Raom's axe cleaved through the creatures back. Even the mighty stomach of Raom, hardened under a lifetime of ale, turned over when the creature twisted against the severed spine and silently hissed. Raom and the Shissar Revenant clenched together and Raom's feet slid as the creatures venomed claw closed in on his face. Raom's left hand let go of the axe handle and with a powerful magical blast he smashed the half-snake against the temple wall. Loral held his symbol of Tunare and whispered a prayer calling great tendrils from the earth around the serpentine body of the rotting horror. Another prayer sent rays of light bursting from the creatures broken chest and it slid to the ground, it's evil spirit departed.</p>

      <p>Loral turned in time to see Cymil's whirling blades finishing the second revenant. In a wide circular cut of the blade Earthcaller, Cymil sliced the throat of the beast and then sliding his arm tight to his body he stabbed through the beasts torso with twin blade Swiftwind.  The party was stunned to see the green blood boiling off the ground around the dead revenant.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/cymil_golembane.jpg"><img src="./images/cymil_golembane_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Cymil and the Golem" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>As they looked in horror, a great shadow of an enormous golem fell over the weary party. The beast stood as high as a hill giant, it's great fists as wide as Juror's shoulders. Juror was the first to act, channeling a cloud of insects around the beast while Wrenne called upon the powers of her Nature Walker's Scimitar, snaring the giant with roots of the earth. Loral called a blast of magical energy rocking the ancient creature on its heels. Raom's axe cut deep into the thick skin while Cymil's twin blades sliced pieces of clay and stone from the servit's chest and abdomin. With a silent roar, Juror stabbed his etherial tipped spear deep into the knee of the beast bringing it down to their level. Wrenne pointed at the beast and wildfire coursed over its body. Raom cleaved deep into the back of the creture's neck, almost severing it's head from the great body. Cymil dove out of the way as the five ton monster fell to the earth.</p>

      <p>The companions spoke little that night, huddled in the cave of Mons Letalis sharing blackened bread, fish rolls, and magically summoned water from Loral's powerful boots. The following morning Wrenne would be heading back to Norrath along with Juror. Cymil and Raom would be returning to Shadowhaven to learn more in the inns and taverns of the newly discovered city. A snicker broke the heavy air when Juror asked how much they planned to discover at the bottom of a keg of porter, but Loral's mind was elsewhere. He told them of his plans to study the lands more, and they knew that was a half-truth at best. Loral had little choice if he wished to follow through with the orders of the Church. He would have to enter the temple of Ssraeshza and face whatever horrors lay within.</p>

<p>For one hundred twenty years Yylis had been a slave of the Shissar. For seventy of those years he had worked on the pyramid in the middle of the ocean. Day and night for seventy years the temple had been carved by the Iksar slaves and enchanted by the Shissar warlocks.  For a thousand years the Shissar had ruled Norrath, but their time on the green world was at an end.  A new life would begin for them elsewhere.</p>

<p>Slavery was the only life Yylis knew.  He felt no love, no pride, no anger. He only felt hopelessness and despair. Yylis had seen his mate die and brought back as a horrible skeletal creature to continue the work she had done in life. His children were taken from him at birth while he did nothing to stop it, knowing resistance meant death and undead servitude. He never saw his children again. There was no escape from the Shissar or their tyranny, there was only obedience.</p>

      </div>

      <p>One day the Shissar taskmasters sent hundreds of Iksar into the great temple while hundreds more were packed around the outside, crushing them against the outer stone walls. Buried in a mass of his Iksar companions, Yylis watched the Shissar nobles enter the temple, breathing their last breath of Norrathian air. Yylis felt his ribs crack as even more slaves were forced around the great temple. Through his agony he heard the chanting of the serpent warlocks, coming from around the perimeter of the slave horde. A blinding magical sphere began to form around the pyramid and slave horde cutting the unlucky Iksar who formed the outside ring of the horde into pieces as it reached the ground. Then they were gone. The green sky of Norrath was replaced with the blue sky of the Grey. The sphere of his home world stood hanging above them.  Before he could comprehend the strange sight, Yylis's lungs burst in his chest as did the lungs of the thousand slaves left outside in the vacuum of the Grey. All around him the Iksar slaves fell dead with no last sound, no scream, no final plea or proclamation. Yylis knew as his eyes went dark that his servitude had just begun.</p>

      <p>Five thousand years later the corpse of Yylis walked outside the temple of Ssraeshza. Long gone were any memories of his life, now only the three word command of the Shissar necromancers filled his head - protect the temple. For five thousand years he had guarded this temple, skin peeling away from his bones, eyes sinking into his skull, fingers cracking into horrible sharp claws.  Then one day he was released.  A great blast of pure light broke him into pieces. A blue armored cleric of Tunare stood twenty feet away, white wisps of holy energy drifting up from his hands. After five thousand years, Yylis had finally found peace.</p>

        <a href="./images/ssraeshza_artwork.jpg"><img src="./images/ssraeshza_artwork.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Carving of the defilers" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral walked over and picked up the ancient skull of the Iksar slave. For a brief moment he felt a great weight of sadness for the Iksar. He felt the torment of millions of slaves over thousands of years. The Iksar had truly lost everything.  There was nothing in their lives but horror and sadness. Loral looked up to the giant Shissar statues flanking the tunnel leading deep into the temple and understood the true meaning of evil.</p>

      <p>Loral was no stranger to evil.  He had felt the sickening blood-rain run over his face in the Plane of Fear. His mind had swam with the paranoia and rage that flowed through the air of the Plane of Hate. This tunnel was somewhere different, somewhere outside the influence of the Gods of Norrath. It was a temple of defilers and the weight of his future should he enter fell upon him. Loral clasped his hand around his warden symbol of Tunare and stepped into the tunnel.</p>

      <p>"Good, You're here", said the Sorceress Azile as if they were walking into Tovania's Venom in Felwithe.  Loral was shocked at her presence, but she seemed not surprised in the least to see him.  Her small but strong hand took Loral by the arm and led him down a short finely carved hallway of the entrance to Ssraeshza. At the end stood a large set of carved stone doors. Azile closed her eyes and tilted her head, Loral noted the glimmer from the lotus symbol on her dark red robes. "They are ready for us downstairs," She said reaching into a small pouch on her belt. Chanting a quick incantation, Azile and Loral faded from sight.</p>

      <p>The oddity of seeing his longtime friend in this horror of a place shook Loral's thoughts into a jumbled mess. It felt like the chaos of a dream forming just before falling asleep. His thoughts became clear, however, when the twin doors opened and revealed the Shissar guardians. Standing over ten feet tall and adorned with finely crafted golden armor, the Shissar protectors stood guard in the large tiered room.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/ssraeshza_elevator.jpg"><img src="./images/ssraeshza_elevator_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Gateway of the Ssraeshza temple" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Though the presence of the Shissar demanded attention, Loral's eyes were drawn to a huge stone carving above the corridor directly across from them.  A sudden addition to the horror of the Shissar's rule became clear. The Shissar required slaves even when retreating to the void of the Grey, that was already known to the Elven sages. But the Shissar aparently used the Soriz tribe for more than just labor.</p>

      <p>They used them for food.</p>

      <p>Visions flooded into Loral's mind. Iksar families being torn apart, the strong being sent to work until death, the weak being harvested to feed the isolated Shissar masters. Surely any escape from such treatment, even at the poisoned hand of Cazic Thule himself, was not simply a choice for the lost people, but a necessity. With the trials of the Elven nation of Tunaria and the fall of Takish Hiz, Loral wondered whether the high elves could have chosen any differently.</p>

      <p>Azile ran between a pair of the serpent beasts and Loral felt his skin crawl when one of the creatures hissed, apparently at nothing at all. Loral followed Azile through the twisting corridors and down a great floating column of thick air that led down into the depths of the dark temple. There they joined fellow members of Lotus Cult in their hunt of the undead Iksar slaves as they dug deep into a mine-shaft.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/ssraeshza_mines.jpg"><img src="./images/ssraeshza_mines_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Mines" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>For hours they battled the vile skeletons.  Azile's spells blasted through the creatures while Loral's spells of healing sealed the wounds of Lotus Cult's great fighters.  Through the onslaught of skeletal slaves attacking the small raiding party one point had struck home. It had been Loral's hope to find the Shissar dormant in their sinister lair, buried under the wastelands of Luclin and no danger to Felwithe. This was not the case, the Shissar were active indeed.</p>

      <p>The Shissar were digging.</p>

      <p>Surely this information was critical to report to Felwithe. Surely if Norrath ever faced a truly dangerous enemy, the Shissar was it. Loral's decision was clear, he must return to Felwithe and report on this news. Rescuing the lost Paladin would have to wait until the elders could figure out a true battle plan against the Shissar.</p>

<p> Loral explained his plan to Azile and she nodded her agreement. He reached into his dusty ransacker pack and pulled out the Faithstone of Nature. A powerful artifact given by the Hierophant Skrabbit on behalf of Lotus Cult, the Faithstone had the ability to return Loral back to the church of Felwithe with with but a single prayer. Loral began the chant and soon faded away.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/shissar_den.jpg"><img src="./images/shissar_den_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Den of the serpent priests" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>A dark magic, a millenia old, spliced into the conduit of the ethereal tunnel and pulled the visage of the Tunarian priest off track. Loral shook off the unbalance of magical teleportation and opened his eyes. Instead of the warm arms of the church Loral had spent his entire childhood in, he found himself in a dark chamber deep within the temple of Ssraeshza. Loral heard the hissing of the Shissar High Priests all around him, their red eyes looking at him as they would a dead thing. Loral pulled his blue draconian helmet off from his matted hair and let it fall to the floor. He closed his eyes and whispered a prayer to Tunare. He knew no answer would come.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">89@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>"It was a dark moment, my boy. Perhaps darker than any I had faced before. The ancient serpents paralyzed me mentally and physically with powers not seen on the face of Norrath in five thousand years. They studied me as they would have studied a strange rock. While the minutes crept by like hours they continued hissing to each other, their burning yellow eyes never leaving mine. Only one fate seemed possible. I was surely dead."</p>

      <p>Loral paused and scratched his newly grown beard, a habit he knew drove his avid listener crazy. Though the warm breeze and soft rustle of the trees created one of the most serene moments Loral had ever witnessed, his companion, a small Elven boy, seemed ready to break under the tension of Loral's tale. Just as the boy was about to protest, shouting his rage of impatience, Loral continued.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/felwithe_lake.jpg" title="The lake of Felwithe."><img src="./images/felwithe_lake_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The lake of Felwithe." /></a>
      </div>

      <p>"Their decision had apparently been made. The largest of their number, a great ancient serpent covered with deeply etched glyphes in its rotting scales, moved forward extending a jagged claw towards my face. Red bolts of energy shot from nail to nail as it got closer. But before that horrible claw tore my face and mind from my body and spirit, the creature's head exploded into white light and dark green gore."</p>

      <p>The boy literally bounced with excitement.</p>

      <p>"Zolina knocked another arrow and let it fly into the chest of the glyphed serpent. Juror's powerful spirit-tipped spear skewered one of the guardians while the rescue party stepped through Tarzel's planar gateway. The shining runed blade of Lavun tore open a rift in the fabric of nature releasing a great green hand of roots, moss and vines that crushed another attacking Shissar between its giant fingers.  A huge golem, as large as the fire giants of Nagafen's Lair roared towards the party but a bolt of pure energy burned a hole straight through the beast. I saw the smoking hands and grey eyes of Azile through the hole in the chest of the golem just before it crashed to the ground. Knowing I was safe, my mind turned off and I fell unconscious into the arms of my friends."</p>

      <p>Relief flowed into the boy and he fell back against the large oak behind him. Loral smiled and tugged at the fishing line cutting into the mirror surface of the small lake they sat by. Though the boy had heard the story before, he never seemed any less nervous at the outcome than he had here today. Remembering his own actions at hearing such tales of adventure, Loral looked to the boy and smiled. Darlan was a wonderful son, indeed.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/faydark_portal.jpg" title="The spires of Greater Faydark"><img src="./images/faydark_portal_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The spires of Greater Faydark" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Loral's mind trailed back those seventy five years as he thought about the tale of the Shissar. How much his life had changed. How much Norrath had changed. While that day had been dark indeed, many dark days had followed. The Shissar had been a great menace but even they stayed buried in their tomb when the rifts opened. Magic had grown from a thing of mystery and wonder into the norm of everyday life. Merchants and tradesmen no longer traveled in caravans or on ships preferring the speed and safety of teleportation. The Antonican bards had disbanded under the competition of the psychic abilities of wizard guilds. It was a different age.</p>

      <p>Then chaos began. It started with reports of travelers becoming lost during teleportation. Stories of parties appearing buried in rock or returning transformed into horrible manifestations circulated. Then the rifts opened. Planiar beasts of fire, stone, flesh and crustation poured into the lands. Armies of city militia were slaughtered by creatures never dreamed of in the worst nightmares of children. Powerful adventurers far and wide returned to their homelands and thus began the Plane Wars.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/akanon.jpg" title="Ak'Anon"><img src="./images/akanon_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Ak'Anon" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>For ten years the wars raged, destroying cities and gods. Loral's powers of healing fed armies of Elven knights, rangers and warriors. Deep in the wizard guilds of Odus, Felwithe, Neriak and Freeport the great spellcasters looked for an end to the menace and just when all seemed lost, they found it.</p>

      <p>Life began again for the people of Norrath. After 120 years of service to the Mother, Loral retired to the life of a jeweler and though his mate, the only mortal woman Loral had ever loved, had been slain in the last days of the Plane Wars, Loral's life was lived again through the eyes of his son.</p>

      <p>With the turn of the seasons, Loral and Darlan traveled across Norrath. Over the months they traded the intricate mechanics of Ak'Anon with the velium of the hearty Coldain and the finely crafted gems of Odus for the black acrylia of Luclin. They found great profit in their lives but living his adventures through Darlan was the greatest treasure of all.</p>

      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/emperor_gateway.jpg" title="The shissar gateway"><img src="./images/emperor_gateway_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The shissar gateway" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>Now spring brought them back to Felwithe where they fished during the day and met with old friends in the nearby cities at night. Though his trials had been great over the past two centuries, Loral had finally found the happiness he always sought.</p>

      <p>Dark telepathic visions passed from the Shissar interrogator to the ancient glyphed serpent. The beast studied the pale elf, pinned ten feet off the ground by the titanic arms of two enormous golems. Bolts of dark energy sliced through the figure, sending him into spasms. The interrogator had performed such operations before and few had ever survived. Though this broken priest still had some sort of mental activity, the Shissar wasn't convinced that the tiny mortal hadn't already gone insane. A few more hours would tell, but it was doubtful that this one would live through the night.</p>

      <description>&quot;And what of the heroic paladin lost to the Shissar? What ever happened to him?&quot; Loral had told his son...</description>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">90@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>"And what of the heroic paladin lost to the Shissar? What ever happened to him?"</p>

      <p>Loral had told his son the tale of his rescue in Ssraeshza many times but this was the first time Darlan had asked this question. Loral found it puzzling, not just the question but something else. A burning sensation in his hand interrupted his train of thought but a voice in the nearby woods took back his attention.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/faydark.jpg" title="Greater Faydark"><img src="./images/faydark_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Greater Faydark" /></a>
      </div>

      <p>"Aye, old friend, what ever did happen to that broken down old knight."  Stepping out of the brush to the grassy hill where Loral and Darlan sat with their picnic came Jolain Goldenleaf dressed in the traditional silver and gold armor of the Felwithe paladins. Resting over one shoulder was his legendary blade, Nature's Defender, and a green cloak fell lazily over the other. He held his golden helmet next to his hip.  A lock of his jet black hair had come free from his neat pony tail and fell across his scarred face. Loral stood and embraced his old friend.</p>

      <p>For an hour the two traded tales of their adventures. While Loral and Darlan had been traveling across Antonica, Jolain had been training Felwithe's newest recruits. This day his students traveled through the forest of the Faydark, keeping a watchful eye for orc invaders who, even two hundred years later, continued to pour forth from Crushbone.</p>

      <p>Their tales shifted to their partnership during the plane wars, entertaining young Darlan with visions of the golden armies of elves and stout dwarves standing strong against giant and powerful demons never meant to walk Norrath. For ten years Loral and Darius had served together, fighting the unnatural horrors of the outer planes and pushing them back to and finally through the rifts to their own planes. Although highly entertained with such marvelous tales, Darlan's original question returned.</p>

      <p>"How was Sir Goldenleaf returned from Ssraeshza?"</p>

      <p>"Aye, friend, I have little recollection of the event. What ever did become of the vile Shissar?" Both Jolain and Darlan looked to Loral. The burning became stronger in Loral's hand, breaking his concentration on the question. Images of the Shissar flashed into his mind, jolting him suddenly and ringing his ears, but Jolain's questions continued.</p>

      <p>"Did the elves know of the tunnels below? Were the cities of Norrath planning an assault? What of Katta Castellum or Sanctus Seru? What did those cities know of the threat of the Shissar?" Jolain's questions pounded inside his head. Gone was the sweet sound of birds chirping and crickets seeking their mates. Gone was the sound of the water passing down the rocky stream. All he heard was the hissing questions and all he felt was the white hot burning sensation in the center of his left palm.</p>

      <p>Then it all became clear. Loral looked into the eyes of Jolain and raised his palm towards the knight. A beam of pure white light burst forth, turning the armored elf into ash. The beam continued, searing through the forest like paper and seeming to crack the very fabric of the world in half. The scene around him shattered like a rock being thrown through a mirror. Loral found himself in darkness.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/taskmaster.jpg" title="The Shissar Taskmaster"><img src="./images/taskmaster.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Shissar Taskmaster" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Immediate was the pain he felt all throughout him. He screamed when he tried to move. His one eye opened, the other swollen shut, and beheld the great glyphed Shissar before him. To his right he saw the great golem pinning him to the walls of the dark temple with giant clay hands. Not a muscle in his body or a nerve in his head was free from the electrical energies the Shissar spells pumped through him. With a mouth capable of swallowing his hole head, the glyphed serpent hissed at him, exposing great fangs as long as Loral's forearm. The ancient beast reached forward, preparing to tear out the troublesome elf's heart when the room went silent.</p>

      <p>Visions of battle and fire filled Loral's head. The glyphed serpent turned towards another smaller Shissar and hissed an intricate throaty command. The smaller snake replied and the two turned and slithered towards the great door at the other end of the large room.</p>

      <p>A moment later, the great golem that pinned Loral's arms to the wall stepped away and Loral fell to the floor in a crumpled ball of agony. It thundered quickly out the door leaving Loral alone in the large room.</p>

      <p>It took all of Loral's energy to remember how to breathe.  His one open eye spotted a golden glimmer a short distance away. His left arm broken above the elbow, Loral shifted to his right side and inched across the floor, each move bringing waves of pain and blackness. Twelve feet and an eternity later, Loral found the source of the golden glimmer, a small idol of Tunare poking out of his five large packs. That golden glimmer turned into a glimmer of hope. Loral snaked his good arm through the straps of his worn leather packs and drew out the Faithstone of Nature. He whispered his prayers to Tunare and held the stone close. Thirty seconds later, the room flashed away and he was lying on the marble floors of the Church of Felwithe hearing the gasps of Yeolarn and the priests of the Mother.</p>

      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/dog_in_growth.jpg" title="Dog"><img src="./images/dog_in_growth_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Dog" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Dog raised his large head from the thick grass as the voice of Mother filled his mind. As always, a great feeling of love and warmth filled him when he heard it, even if he knew it meant having to leave his games with Rex or his meals to help her. Dog trotted through the large woods, past the great tree where Mother stayed and past the walking trees that guarded her. He ran through the blue stream taking joy in the great splash and the feeling of water soaking into his thick fur. Soon he came upon four large pillars and an open marble floor. In the center was a small one, dressed in a light yellow robe. Dog had been asked to help before, mostly to show the small ones who appeared towards the great tree, but sometimes not.</p>

<p>Today, Dog had to point the small one away, back to the glowing tunnel that stood to the side of the large platform. Dog licked the small one's face rolling it over onto its back. Dog turned his head to the side and perked up his ears hearing the faint beat within the small one's chest. Another great lick and the small one bolted upright. Dog could smell the fear in the small one, but felt it leave when the small one looked into Dog's eyes. With his great muzzle, Dog pushed the small one onto its feet and pushed it back into the tunnel from where it came. When the small one had left, Dog trotted back to his original resting place, assured that he had done well and salivating at the smell of his sixth meal of the day waiting for him.</p>

      <p>"It was as real as the life I have lived until now."  Loral sat with Juror in the small bar of Shadowhaven and recounted his tale four weeks after his return to the temple. "Two hundred years I had lived, all illusions of the Shissar trying to tear open my mind."  The large barbarian, much wiser than his great size imparted, sat and listened to the cleric's tale. It wasn't until the end of Loral's story, detailing a life that had never been lived, that Juror shared a piece of information that explained Loral's chance for escape.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/shadowhaven.jpg" title="Shadowhaven"><img src="./images/shadowhaven_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Shadowhaven" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>"Lotus Cult killed the Glyphed Covered Serpent shortly after you left," Juror's deep voice said calmly.  Loral looked at the barbarian for a long time.  Although his head still swam with the false-life the Shissar had implanted, the relief of knowing the vile creature that fed it to him was killed took a great weight off of his shoulders.  He looked to his friend again and became aware of the large barbarian's greying hair and lined face.  How long the two of them had served their deities.  How long they had worked together within the great network of Healers that spanned so many races and so many societies.  While Loral had certainly aged less physically in his 110 years of service, he felt no younger than his friend looked.</p>

      <p>Later that night Loral rested in the darkness, staring up at the ceiling of the small stone room of the inn in Shadowhaven. In two days he would be traveling to Katta Castellum to look into an unknown undead menace that could possibly be in the area. The church had sent word of the discovery and Juror gave Loral information to further the claim. Fellow members of Healers United would meet him in the dark city, and they would investigate and deal with the threat.</p>

      <p>The unknown threat was not on his mind, however. Loral knew the Healers would be able to deal with such a menace, whatever it turned out to be. Instead Loral's mind went back through a life he never lived, mourning the death of a wife he never had. A tear fell across his cheek before he fell into a deep sleep.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Since the dawn of Norrath, pain, torment, and horror all paid homage to the Plane of Fear. Dark demons and foul spellcrafters delighted in the terror of mortals, reveling in their power as servants to one of the most powerful gods of Norrath, Cazic Thule. The Faceless, as he was sometimes called, had the largest number of followers in all the lands and there had never been a threat to his reign as the Lord of Fear. This day, however, he faced the worst danger he ever knew.</p>
<div class="imageset1"><a href="./images/fear_stones.jpg"><img src="./images/fear_stones_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Plane of Fear" /></a></div>
<p>The fiends watched in curiosity as the rifts opened. Large tears in the fabric of their world sucked foul air into Norrath on the other side of the rifts. The scouts came first, recognized as Iksar by the minions of Fear. One such demon, a bat-winged fiend known as Gamblazan, glided forward towards a scout, planning to tear open the small lizard for its intrusion. But the lean Iksar struck first, stabbing through the naturally armored chest of the red beast with his ethereal tipped spear. Gamblazan stared down at the mortal and fell dead to the tainted earth.</p>

<p>With a rhythmic rumble, five hundred Iksar poured through two dozen rifts into the Plane of Fear. Alraza Thule, the Bloodqueen, looked over to Dread, another of Thule's demi-gods, and shrugged in confusion. This confusion soon disappeared when behind the Iksar army slithered 
in the Shissar.</p>

<p>A war greater than one ever seen upon Norrath filled the Plane of Fear. Waves of roaring magma turned scores of screaming Iksar into ash. More were tossed into the air only to come crashing down, bursting into gore. The destruction of their slave army did little to discourage the Shissar Warmasters. While their well equipped fodder distracted the minions of Thule, the Shissar struck at Cazic Thule's children, the demi-gods of Fear.</p>

<p>Twelve great sorcerers hurled great beams of pure energy at the hulking wolf-headed beast, Gromhazik the Chaosfiend. His pitch black skin split and charred, burning down to the bone. Arunz the Amygdalan King carved through dozens of the Iksar soldiers when the telekinetic grasp of five Shissar channelers took hold. Arunz screamed loud enough to turn every head, mortal and immortal, until a power greater than the combined strength of every giant of Norrath ripped him to pieces.</p>
<div class="imageset2"><a href="./images/emperor_ssraeshza_3.jpg"><img src="./images/emperor_ssraeshza_3_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Lord Ssraeshza" /></a></div>
<p>Watching from a nearby hill, the Bloodqueen began a great incantation when a powerful blow from behind stole the words from her lips. She looked down to the golden-runed blade protruding from her chest. Twisting around she beheld her slayer, the Shissar King Ssraeshza. With a sneer, the Shissar lord pushed the dead demi-goddess off of his blade and wiped the black blood on her rotten mantle.</p>

<p>Seeing three of his children die in as many minutes told Cazic Thule of the danger he faced. Beckoning for one of his alchemists, he roared instructions to the quivering beast. They had only one chance, releasing the Greenmist.</p>

<p>A great cloud of green fog flowed out of the Amygdalan temple and wafted through the confused combatants, both demonic and Iksar alike. Not until he saw four of his generals fall over dead amidst healthy troops did the threat become clear to the Shissar King. Looking over at the great form of The Faceless, he cursed, and along with his remaining generals, the lord of the Shissar left the Plane of Fear through one of the remaining rifts back to Norrath.</p>

<p>But the Greenmist followed and five thousand years later the Emperor of the Shissar could still feel its weight on his shoulders. He felt too the sickening feeling that Cazic Thule must have felt when the Lord of Fear saw true danger at the hands of mortals. The lord of the Shissar, Emperor Ssraeshza, had seen his generals slain, his oldest and most trusted advisors cut down, and his personal guard neutralized. His greatest creation, the Blood Golem, a construct built from the lifeblood of five hundred generations of Iksar and protected under the greatest spells of protection his priests could provide, had been cut down in his own inner sanctum.</p>

<p>Now he stood and looked into the eyes of his slayer. The mortal adventurer stood in front of him, cutting deep with blades forged to pierce his impenetrable scales and bathed in a beam of energy fed by a dozen high priests of a dozen different gods. For each mortal cut the emperor inflicted on this warrior, the wound closed as soon as the ancient blade had finished the stroke. The air burst around him into fire, ice, and electricity. Four dozen other blades cut into his scaled skin but this avatar of a dozen gods took all of his attention. This warrior had become a vehicle of revenge for all the gods 
perverted by word and deed of the ancient Shissar emperor and could not 
die.  With a final cut, the most devastating ruler to ever walk Norrath 
was 
killed."</p>
<div class="imageset2"><a href="./images/emperor_ssraeshza_4.jpg"><img src="./images/emperor_ssraeshza_4.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Emperor Ssraeshza" /></a></div>
<p>It had been two weeks since Loral returned from the Temple of Ssraeshza. He sat at the end of the bar of the inn of Shadowhaven where he had spent many of his nights in luclin. At one table sat three trolls, one sharing the tale of the death of the Shissar emperor with his disbelieving companions. The golden-runed blade strapped to his back spoke a greater truth than the trolls loud voice. When Loral looked too long at the wicked blade he felt a hiss in his mind and was reminded of the treachery he felt under the terrible powers of the Shissar interrogator. What tales that blade could tell, he thought, and wondered whether it might ever find the chest of a mighty or terrible god again.</p>

<p>At the other side of the bar stood a young elven paladin.  She looked with disdain upon the troll discussion, turning quickly into a table-breaking bar brawl. The bartender did nothing to intervene, knowing the purses of the trolls to be as large as their mighty ale-filled bellies. Loral watched the fiery-haired Paladin glare at the troll and turn away to finish her champagne cocktail. How much he was reminded of his early days after leaving Felwithe. The paladin had no idea of the horror that troll may have saved Norrath from. Possibly neither did the troll, thinking the Emperor was but another big game hunt. For the young knight of Tunare, the troll was but an annoying disturbance in a normally quiet bar.</p>

<p>The purple and red cross clasped to the paladin's cloak sent Loral's thoughts down a different stream.  For eighty of his 100 years of adventure, Loral had been a member of Healers United.  Unlike the highly political climate between Felwithe's rulership and the Church of Tunare, Loral found a network crossing many faiths, cities, races, and experiences.  It was a large shift from the stereotypical views Felwithe had given the young priest.  Loral was shocked to find the band led by a dark elf priestess of Innoruuk, but after one meeting with Dahlea, Loral saw the kindness behind her sharp gaze and knew he found the right group.  Soon the barbarian oracle, Juror, led the group with his strict adherence to the balance of the Tribunal.  Loral had countless adventures with the members of the Healers and assisted in the protection of young adventurers on their first hunts.  While Loral had found a wonderful tool to help in his travels and a wonderful group of friends to share those travels with, learning of the small differences between the races of Norrath was the lesson that helped Loral the most.  He was richer for the experiences and knowledge of his friends, whatever their race or beliefs.  He suddenly realized just how much Ciric's teachings of balance had helped him.  Without those insights he may never have accepted the Healers or many of the friends he met along his journeys.</p>
<div class="imageset1"><a href="./images/emperor_gate.jpg"><img src="./images/emperor_gate_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Emperor Gate" /></a></div>
<p>Loral remembered stories of the Erudite's first adventures in Norrath. Travelers hardly ever left the safety of their cities.  In those days, transportation was by foot or boat.  The magic of teleportation had yet to be discovered. Beasts ruled the lands between the walled cities and much of the magic and artifacts were buried in hidden tombs of long forgotten empires.  With the discovery of teleportation and of the Nexus, new gateways between far off lands became possible and and with the erosion of geographical 
boundaries, the separation of the races became thin as well.</p>

<p>The world had changed in the hundred years Loral had traveled in the service of Tunare. But in many ways he had changed while the world had not. Loral looked at the trolls, once sworn enemies of the elves. The troll storyteller returned his gaze.  Loral raised his glass to the storyteller and smiled.  The troll smiled a toothy grin and returned the toast. Many of these changes were good indeed.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, the Plane Wars began.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Loral looked with revulsion into the pit that led into the Plane of Disease and the giant pipe that eternally poured forth the black liquid inside. The stench of the pit overwhelmed him, burning the inside of his nose and causing his lungs to constrict. The tainted fountain was a dark contrast to the beauty of the land that surrounded it. The Plane of Tranquility promised an eternal peace. It was the land Loral always dreamed of - a land of green grass, clear waters, and quiet solitude. Like the curled demonic finger of an ancient beast protruding through the ground, the spout of disease-ridden fluid reminded Loral of his task. He would have to enter this infested portal. Loral slipped on his turtle-bone ring and breathed in the clean air that flowed from the ring's innate mystical power. With a final look around, he dove into the tainted pit.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/disease_pipe.jpg"><img src="./images/disease_pipe_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>A great splash of the vile liquid deposited the cleric into the Plane of Disease. Loral landed hard on one knee, gritting his teeth. One hand clutched the Symbol of Tunare around his neck and the other gripped an ethereal hammer. If the smell of the sewer in Tranquility was revolting, the smell of this new world was unimaginable. Loral gagged at first, even with the aid of his magical ring. A fog rolled over the stone slab where Loral found himself. A great green lake, foul and thick, surrounded the slab on three sides while a wall of rotting flesh reached into the grey sky above.</p>
      <p>A clap on his shoulder shot Loral upright, sending a wave of nervous energy down into his fingertips. When he turned, he saw the grin of two hundred teeth and the emerald eyes of Rasthik the beastlord. If Loral found himself assaulted by the odor of this place, he could not imagine how Rasthik was managing to survive. The lizard-man could smell the blood of a dead Vampyre from a quarter mile away. Loral heard another splash and Warrick the barbarian shaman fell from the portal to the slab. Loral noticed that Warrick had taken the less subtle approach of sticking two twisted rags into his nostrils to avoid the stench. Loral smiled but his smile quickly faded when he remembered where he and his friends had come.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/disease_landscape.jpg"><img src="./images/disease_landscape_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Loral had spent weeks in the Library of New Tanaan upon arriving in the Plane of Knowledge. He had been sent by the Church of Tunare to investigate the new portals manifesting themselves as books on pedestals all over Norrath's great cities. While the ethereal nature of the planes reminded Loral how different they were from Norrath, it was in the old tomes and dusty parchments of the great library that he fully lost himself. For Loral they were a king's treasure, rivaling that of Lord Nagafen the red dragon. For weeks he buried himself in the precious documents, filled with ancient legends written by hands dead for centuries. Large candles burned down to their bases as he passed the days and nights reading the histories of civilizations and gods long forgotten. It was in those magnificent volumes, covered by millennia of dirt, mold, and cobwebs, that he discovered the tales of Lxanvom, the King's Rest, and its exile into the Plane of Disease.</p>
      <p>Two wolves ran up the rotten flesh bank of the festering lake. Their paws floated over the surface, seeming to move half the speed of the great distance they traveled. When they arrived, the wolves shifted form into two elven rangers of the Healers, Taey and Brooken. Another splash from the invisible portal dropped Isos the Paladin onto the great slab. Together the companions began their trek over the putrid lands of the Bertoxxulous, the Plaguebringer.</p>
      <p>Loral remembered hearing Ciric and Azile talk about the outer Planes. He always found his mind had trouble wrapping around their concept. Ciric explained it best once when comparing it to a scale, with Norrath at the center. Norrath was a balance between good and evil. Many lands and many people, both good and evil, existed all in one world. The further out of the scale you went, the less balance things had. While the Plane of Sky, Growth, and Tranquility were on one side; Fear, Hate, and Nightmare were on the other. There was little balance in many of these planes; they were either good or evil. Nowhere was this clearer than in the Plane of Disease.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/disease_malarian.jpg"><img src="./images/disease_malarian_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Taey's blade severed two of the spined legs of a gigantic insect-like Malarian. The creature returned the attack by spitting an acidic liquid on the ranger through its elongated stinger. Taey recoiled and retched as the acid ate away at her armor and skin. Two of Brooken's crackling arrows slammed into the bloated abdomen of the winged beast as it took flight. A quick prayer from Loral sent a wave of blue energy from his hand to the wounded ranger neutralizing the acid and soothing Taey's wounds. The creature twisted and stared with giant compound eyes upon the meddling cleric, its remaining legs clicking with agitation.</p>
      <p>Telepathic visions flooded into Loral's mind - images of the violent insect ripping Loral's arms off and burrowing its extended maw into his chest. Loral breathed deeply, canceling the horrific images from his mind. He raised a hand and a burning red energy of condemnation crushed the beast's exoskeleton. The creature fell to the ground, breaking into a cloud of noxious gasses. The party jumped back from the infectious cloud but then cheered at each other. The victory was short lived, however, when they saw the spiders, diseased rats and beetles, flowing ooze, and deformed humanoids waiting for them across the fleshy hills.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/disease_crypt.jpg"><img src="./images/disease_crypt_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>For two days Loral traveled across the vile lands. While some adventurers left and others joined, the party crossed streams of sickly bile and walls of scabbed flesh and exposed bone. The world around them appeared to be a single living thing that simply grew into chaos. Soon they came to a large set of what appeared to be vertebrae and beyond it was the first mortal constructed structure they had seen since the stone slab - The Crypt of Decay.</p>
      <p>It was at this ancient structure that Loral witnessed the first sentient beings of this world, the Magi of Bertoxxulous. Empty eye sockets of the Deathbone Magi stared blankly at the party, their rotten chapped lips whispering arcane spells of ancient times. Great fires erupted around the adventurers, but they were quick to retaliate and defeat the plagued wizards.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/disease_gryme.jpg"><img src="./images/disease_gryme_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>With trepidation the party carefully made their way into the crypt, having now expanded into two dozen adventurers. It was as they reached the balcony of the great hall that Gryme, the Crypt Guardian, attacked. Gryme was enormous, as wide as a hill giant is tall. His body was covered with exposed bone wrapped in folds of decaying flesh. His chain-wrapped fists slammed into the front-line attackers of the raiding force, sending them sliding across the stone floor or hurling them into the air.</p>
      <p>A mighty battle ensued. Dozens of arrows bore deep into the back of the giant but seemed to harm it little. Wizards, both Gnomish and Erudite, called forth huge shards of ice and burning rocks upon the beast. The raiders rushed in, cutting deep into the thick festering flesh of the creature. With a great heaving breath, Gryme vomited a cloud of poisonous gas, sending the attackers to their knees. Loral and the other priests of the raiding force sent wave after wave of healing energy into those who had been caught within the cloud. Soon Loral felt the last amount of Tunare's energy leave him. With little left to do, he drew forth his magical hammer of Judgment and rushed in. Gryme's iron clad knuckles smashed into Loral. The blow shattered his nose and knocked him instantly unconscious.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/gryme_dead.jpg"><img src="./images/gryme_dead_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>The crack of his nose being pushed back into place jolted Loral awake but before the wave of pain drove him back to unconsciousness he felt a warmth of energy flow through him, soothing and mending the bone. He sat upright, once again gagging as the smell of the accursed land flooded into his nostrils. The mound of the decaying corpse of Gryme and the recovering raiding party was nearby. Many had fallen to the horrid breath of the rotting crypt guardian and many others had been crushed by his heavily-armored fists.</p>
      <p>One of the raiders with the stomach strong enough to approach the corpse of Gryme, a powerful human warrior named Zarcharius, found a tiny key attached to a rope around the beast's engorged neck. The grim warrior looked up towards the stairway that led deeper into the crypt. It was clear that a good part of him wished he never had found the key, just as many of his fellow adventurers wish they hadn't stepped foot into this diseased world. But a gleam in his eye, one of adventure and discovery, drove him forward. He drew his gleaming black-runed blade and walked up the ancient staircase of the crypt. Everyone else followed.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Breath burned through Loral's lungs as he raced across the land of Nightmares. He could hear the pursuing hobgoblins getting closer as their claws tore up the ground behind him. Purple luminescent clouds raced across the eternally black sky and the elongated fingers of long dead trees reached for Loral, whipping past him as he ran. Loral tripped on a stone as eager for his death as the pursuing demons. He was up with a flash, his blood pumping through his veins. The hobgoblins licked their lips in anticipation of the feast... for nothing was as sweet as the blood of a mortal. The leader of the pursuing demons leapt forward and clawed at Loral's back. Two of the 12-inch claws were turned away by Loral's draconian armor but the third ripped across the back of his neck down to the bone.</p>
      <p>Loral's vision blurred from shock but his legs did not stop. Ahead he saw the gates of Thule. Towering over 15 feet tall, the skeletal guardians of the gate would easily finish the job the hobgoblins started. Their eyes blazed and they smiled a grin of a thousand needle-like teeth when they saw Loral coming. Loral had one more trick. A word to Tunare surrounded him with an impenetrable shield of force. The claws of the mighty guardians skimmed off of the shield and Loral ran through the gates into the lair of Terris Thule.</p>
      <p>Loral collapsed to the ground, blood flowing from the wound on his neck. A warmth traveled over the wound, closing it and sending waves of relief into Loral's body. He looked up into the smiling face of Axen, dwarf priest of Brell and cleric of Lotus Cult. Loral realized he was surrounded by the hunters of the Cult. Loral was lifted to his feet by the strong hand of the troll warlord, Grongl, who grinned at him with yellow teeth.</p>
      <p>"On behalf of the church of Tunare and the adventurers of Healers United, I offer my services to you for this exploration," Loral stuttered.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/nightmare_deathknight.jpg"><img src="./images/nightmare_deathknight_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Protector of Nightmares" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>"Exploration? BAH!" roared Grongl at the priest. "This is an execution! You wish to help? Keep me alive." Grongl walked off laughing. Loral turned to meet the calm gaze of Binedina, the barbarian priestess and leader of the guild. Holding her fur cloaks tight around her, she nodded to Loral and smiled. Beside her, Loral met the cool gaze of a dark elf dressed in soft black leather from head to foot. Her master of assassins, Loral guessed, although the assassin's form seemed to change each time they met. Loral had known Gnix for years but could never guess what race he truly was. The assassin smiled.</p>
      <p>There was little time for further greetings. The raiding party was divided into groups, each member protecting the others with spell, prayer, or steel. Blades came free from their sheaths and scouts were sent out into the valleys of the Nightmare Queen. For a few brief moments, the only sound was the howling wind that blew through the canyons. Soon the scouts returned. They were not alone.</p>
      <p>Built from the tormented souls of mighty heros, heros who betrayed their kings, the Protectors of Nightmares learned obedience from the clenched fist of Terris Thule. Possessing a power greater than most armies, the giant skeletal demons fought with a fury unseen in mortal worlds. A sweep of their powerful arms sent men and women of legend crashing into the walls. Fire burst around them from the magics of the raiding sorcerers. Blades cut deep into the black armor of the minions, chipping at the bones beneath. With a final howl of damnation, the Protectors of Nightmares fell.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/nightmare_crypt.jpg"><img src="./images/nightmare_crypt_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The keep of Thule" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>For two days, the raiding party traveled through the canyons. They met with only a few of Terris Thule's guardians but each one fought with the rage of eternal torment. The raiding party planned well for these encounters, mixing powerful magics and combat tactics to defeat the mounted riders. It was on their third day that the party found the inner sanctum of the Queen of Nightmares.</p>
      <p>For years, Terris Thule, the Dream Scorcher, had seen the paths of mortals through their twisted dreams. Deep in her keep she closed her eyes and envisioned the coming army, secure in her powers and her defenses. An arcane whisper brought spheres of protection around her skin, protection from both blade and spell. She looked around the hall, insuring all was in place. She waited. Soon the attackers entered.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/nightmare_terris.jpg"><img src="./images/nightmare_terris_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Terris Thule, The Dream Scorcher" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Grongl stepped forward into the hall, the rest of the party moving in a half circle around him. He drew his swords, Bloodfrenzy and the Blade of Carnage. A single shout from the troll warlord sent the raid into action. Spellcasters began their incantations while a rain of arrows fell upon the demi-goddess. The arrows exploded into energy around her, though none hit home. Waves of ice and flame rushed over Terris Thule, blocked by her wards of protection. With another command, the swordsmen attacked. Rushing in with blades drawn they cut into the energy shields surrounding the goddess. The Dream Scorcher laughed.</p>
      <p>A wave of her hand sent the attackers to their knees. Visions of unthinkable terror flowed into their minds, shattering their resolve. With no warning, spectral guardians of the nightmare queen rose to slay the paralyzed army. But strength found its way back into the attackers. They broke into groups, each battling the specters while another force remained upon the daughter of Cazic. Soon the specters were cut down and the attackers reunited on the goddess, filled once again with the fury of battle.</p>
      <div class="imageset1">
        <a href="./images/nightmare_stone_demons.jpg"><img src="./images/nightmare_stone_demons_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Stone Demons" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>Terris Thule's protections began to weaken. The blades and spells of the Cult cut deeper into her defenses. But the queen had one last defense. Far above her, the last guardians of the Dream Scorcher came to life. Stone demons crashed to the floor and stood, their thirty foot wings spreading out to the sky. The roars of the demons deafened the attackers. The demons crashed into the flanks of the attacking party, cutting into the groups of spellcasters like knives through paper. Dachunker, a powerful female troll warlord of the Cult, smashed the knee of one of the great beasts with two skull-headed maces. But another demon stabbed its claws through her back and out the front of her stomach. Blood poured from the warrior's mouth and she fell to the ground dead.</p>
      <p>Loral rushed forward to restore life to the fallen heroine but the hand of Maylay the Necromancer stopped him. With a smile to the Tunarian priest, he knelt down and touched the forehead of the troll. Dachunker's eyes grew dark but her body stirred. Dachunker stood, her wound still pouring forth lifeblood and gore. Terris Thule sent another wave of nightmarish visions into the walking corpse but they had no effect. Nightmares, it seemed, did little to deter the dead. The zombie dropped the twin maces she had been fighting with and from her back drew a sword Loral had last seen in a Shadowhaven bar - the Sword of Ssraeshza. Piercing through any remaining spells of protection, the troll stabbed hard and slammed it through Terris Thule's chest. Black blood poured to the floor as the goddess fell. The 5000 year old golden-runed sword had once again earned the name Godslayer.</p>

        <a href="./images/torment_alone.jpg"><img src="./images/torment_alone_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Plane of Torment" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>A powerful blow sent Loral sliding across the ground as the last of Terris Thule's guardians sought revenge. Loral attempted to call forth the protective prayers of Tunare but the last word caught in his throat as the fist of the demon slammed into him.</p>
      <p>Loral woke. A weight seemed to press down upon him as he sat upright. His eyes were filled with a red fog. He looked down to see he wore the yellow robes of a Tunarian acolyte. Standing upright took much effort but the vision surrounding him nearly sent him back to the ground. The world had changed. The red fog of his vision surrounded everything. Across a sea of blackness he could make out a floating island, a keep, suspended from an unknown ceiling by an enormous chain. For months Loral had studied the outer planes and he knew he was no longer in the Plane of Nightmares. If ever there was a place darker and more terrible, it was here - The Plane of Torment.</p>

<p><em>It is with a quivering hand that I write my last words. At my feet lies my lord, the thirteenth Adan, king of our lands. My blade is buried in his back. His blood stains the hand that writes these words. It was the promise of great strength, whispered sweetly and softly to my ears over the years that has caused this to happen. Whispers of dreams and power realized. The dreams spoke of a ritual, glyphs and runes I have inscribed upon the floor of this place, the Kings Rest. It is irony that I am now hearing whispers of truth. I have betrayed my king and my people, the voice says, not as a revelation but as torment. I hear the hissing laughter of my new lord, the dark lord, the Plaguebringer. I hear his voice, tears falling from my betraying eyes as they look at the green portal that has opened. The voice grows louder. I have a new master now, it says. He is coming...</em></p>

      </div>
<p>A large candle dripped wax onto an oak table while Loral read the ancient tome. The words had been written over four thousand years earlier, only having recently been translated by the scribes of Tanaan. Loral began studying the fall of Lxanvom, the King's Rest, after his adventures took him to its door in the Plane of Disease. He read of Bertoxxulous, the god of disease. For weeks he had been reading the texts, carefully turning the yellowed pages. Nothing took his attention away from the words of a culture long dead. The room grew hot. Loral looked up and saw the scribes of the library step back and out of the way as a small figure in red robes approached.</p>

<p>The room was illuminated by a red glow. Flames danced in Azile's black eyes behind the shadows of her hood. In her hand she held the Staff of the Four, an eternal flame burning at its top. Loral noticed for the first time that in their century of adventures together Azile hadn't aged a day. Azile would be almost one hundred and thirty, Loral calculated, though she looked hardly older than forty. Her eyes spoke of anything but youth. Her power had grown beyond any Loral had ever seen. He had watched her rip open rifts to the depths of the outer worlds and bring forth flames hotter than any known in the mortal world. She was no longer the simple traveler Loral had once known.</p>
      <div class="imageset2">
        <a href="./images/lxanvom_deathknights.jpg"><img src="./images/lxanvom_deathknights_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Deathknights of Lxanvom" /></a>
      </div>
<p>An unpleasant vision filled Loral's mind. He dreamed of the elder gods dead within their own worlds.  He saw armies of adventurers slaying the immortals of the outer planes and storming timeless keeps and castles. Visions of Fennin Ro's smouldering corpse lying upon the charred ground of Fire sending a column of black smoke into the air flashed in his mind. Above the corpse, floating upon a cloud of flame rose the new goddess of Fire - Azile the Scorcher.</p>

<p>Azile walked up to the table and sat down next to Loral. She smiled, pulled a small package from her pack, and put it down on the table. The smell of warm cake filled the air around him. Perhaps he was wrong. The vision must have been a trick of the light when she had entered. Too much reading of dramatic old texts, he thought.</p>

<p>"The Lotus has breached the Crypt of Decay," she stated. Loral looked at her unblinking eyes and beheld again the fiery vision.</p>

<p>Despite the cold darkness of the tomb, Loral felt sweat drip down his face. His eyes closed in silent meditation to Tunare, but the rhythmic chanting of the undead summoners could not be blocked out. For three days they had fought the undead of Lxanvom. Decayed husks of old priests and knights attacked with cracked lips pulled back over rotten jagged teeth. They had cut through the minions of the upper floors with little trouble, but when they entered the lower depths of the crypt they found a greater evil.</p>

<p>The summoners, undead priests of a lost age, called fourth the remains of the kings of Lxanvom. Torn from their rest and twisted into hideous forms, the kings attacked with strength and fury. They attacked with bloated fists and the pincers of enormous spiders. The sounds of thunder and the smells of burning flesh filled the crypt that had gone untouched for so many centuries. The blades of the Cult ripped into the kings and their minions, cutting through the material world and into the world of the tormented souls. One by one the evil forms of once great rulers fell.</p>

      </div>
<p>All was quiet. The chanting of the undead priests became screams of death as they sacrificed themselves for a final summoning. The air became foul and cold. The group was silent as the Plaguebringer approached. His green burning eyes beheld them, the defilers of his temple. He reached towards them with a long thin arm ending in a claw with too many joints. The horror of the apparition in front of them held the adventurers as still as death.</p>

<p>A roar of fire broke the trance. The warriors screamed and charged in, blades held high. The clash of steel on hardened bone was deafening. Loral closed his eyes, calling upon the healing and protective magic of the Mother but Bertoxxulous had magic of his own. A dark grey mist flowed from the outstretched hands of the elder God. Loral felt his skin crack open. Sores began to appear and oozed a black liquid. All around him adventurers fell to their knees, their life energy being sapped out of them by the curse of Bertoxxulous.</p>

      </div>
<p>A millennia earlier in lands long forgotten, the children of Veeshan created a weapon of incredible power. Using the skills of the greater wyrms, they forged a spear of prismatic energies capable of stabbing through the thickest scales the dragons had. It had been forged as a weapon for mortals to one day battle the Sleeper, Kerafyrm. Centuries later it had been discovered by an unlikely elf and on this day, it saved her from an unlikely enemy. With milky eyes and sunken cheeks, the rogue Annalyze reared back and threw the ancient spear into the back of Bertoxxulous's skull. With a deafening crack, the Plaguebringer's skull split and he crashed down to the ground.</p>

<p>A week later Loral was back in Tanaan, carefully turning another page from the tome that sat on the table. He took a bite from Azile's cake, feeling a warmth flow down his body. Though grey lines still crossed his face, the scars of Bertoxxulous's curse had almost completely healed. A deeper wound remained open however... a wounding of purpose. For a year, Loral had battled the beings of the planes, fighting for the safety of Faydwer and in the name of Tunare, but to what end? How far would he delve into these realms of uncertainty? For now, Loral could only ponder...and enjoy another piece of cake.</p>

  <p>"The warriors of Zek are not finished with you. The fires of War are eternal. I shall return."</p>

  <p>The words from King Tormax echoed through Loral's head as he watched the frost giant lord die in the icy caverns of Kael Drakkal. For four years he had fought the giants of Kael. Loral had battled the frost giant general, Narandi, during the war of Thurgadin. He had destroyed the guardian of the church of Zek, Derakor the Vindicator. A hundred giants had fallen to Loral's companions. Still the spirit of war did not leave this powerful enemy. The Kromzek leader had fought a war on three fronts, battling Thurgadin, Skyshrine, and the Plane of Growth within the same year. Loral was no tactician but even his priestly mind knew how difficult such a campaign would be. All three enemies of the Kromzek continued to feel the sting of the giants' spears. Scores of Coldain were killed on the river banks of the Great Divide during Narandi's battle. Corpses of young dragons littered the Western Wastes, slain by the mercenaries of Kael. Loral had even found a spy deep within the inner halls of Skyshrine, cloaked and masked by the magic of the Kromzek priests.</p>

  <p>King Tormax lay dead but the sense of dread did not leave Loral. Outside stood the war machines of Kael aimed at the Plane of Growth. The war would be delayed but Loral doubted it had been stopped completely. The priests of Zek were powerful and the giant king would return to his dragon-skull throne. Only one path remained for Loral to follow. There was only one way to protect Tunare. He must remove Kael's resolve to fight. He must remove the source of their murderous spirit. He must face Rallos Zek.</p>

  <div class="imageset1">
    <a href="./images/drundor_tanaan.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_tanaan_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="New Tanaan" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>Ten years had passed since the battles of Kael. Loral sat at a small table in an inn of New Tanaan. Across from him sat a beautiful human female wrapped in red robes. Starkin the ranger walked into the bar and saw the venerable priest in his green robes speaking to her. She soon rose and walked out the door, smiling at Starkin as she left.</p>

  <p>"Who was the woman?" Starkin said as he sat down at Loral's table. "I do not recognize her."</p>

  <p>"Nor will you ever." Loral said with a smile. "I have met her perhaps a dozen times and each time she appears different. You could pass her again on your way out and not even know it."</p>

  <p>"One of the spies of your vast network?" Starkin said teasingly. "Certainly the church would not approve."</p>

  <p>"The Tier'Dal incorporate spies, my friend, I simply have contacts." Loral smiled and took a sip of wine from the crystal glass on his table. "Well informed contacts."</p>

  <p>His demeanor changed though when he remembered the tale of his friend, the enchantress. "The kingdom of Felwithe sent me here to locate threats to the elven nations," he spoke sternly. "The tools I use to fulfill that role are not of their concern. Perhaps the Church would not approve of my methods but they have not seen the dangers I have seen."</p>

  <p>Loral took two rolled parchments from his worn leather pouch. One held the wax seal of the Church of Tunare, the other the symbol of Healers United.</p>

  <div class="imageset2">
    <a href="./images/drundor_hall.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_hall_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Fortress of Drundor" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>"Zek has commissioned the construction of war machines from the gnomish tinkerers of Innovation. He already has an army of warriors and with these new machines he plans to invade Norrath. The model of the metal beast in Innovation was destroyed four days ago but I do not think that will dissuade Zek from his attack on our world. The priests of Kael will open a doorway to Drundor, the Fortress of Zek, and his army will march across Norrath."</p>

  <p>Starkin grew cold. He had seen one of his warriors, a Daiku it was called, in the desert of Storm. It took twelve adventurers to defeat the murderous beast. The creature appeared to be an ogre but with a speed, power, and sturdiness he had never seen in a mortal.</p>

  <p>"A portal has been opened to Drundor from the caves of Tranquility and a raiding party plans to infiltrate the fortress," Loral continued. "I plan on entering with them." Loral handed the two parchments to Starkin. "Please deliver the first to Yeolarn of the Church of Felwithe. The other should go to Juror." Loral rose and embraced his noble friend. "I will return with news soon." Starkin looked at Loral for the truth of that statement. Himself a veteran planewalker, Starkin the Warder knew that Drundor would offer little chance of escape.</p>

  <p>Two days later, Loral entered the Fortress of Zek.</p>

  <p>Norrath was a world of balance. Each element helped to off-set another. The outer planes had no such balance. Stepping foot into Drundor sent a feeling of murderous dread through Loral's skin. Rough stone floors fed into the metal plates of the walls. Steel torches burned harshly, blackening the walls around them. The clashing of steel upon steel, the howl of wild animals bred for war, the roars of triumph, and screams of pain all echoed throughout the halls. Though fifty members strong, the raiding party Loral accompanied felt small. There was no doubt in Loral's mind that he had entered a hall of death. There was no purpose for Drundor other than war.</p>

  <div class="imageset1">
    <a href="./images/drundor_guards.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_guards_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Guards of Drundor" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>Two guards of the fortress, over 20 feet high and armored in steel stained with dirt and blood, saw the approaching raiding party. Without hesitation or nervousness, they drew shining blades from their scabbards and roared as they swung at the front lines, hoping to sever them in half. Thus began the many battles the adventurers faced in the Fortress of Zek.</p>

  <p>All throughout the fortress, the party met the forces of Zek's army. Every guardian of Zek was covered in scars and each fought with the experiences of centuries of combat. Loral imagined the devastation that would face the cities of Norrath as hundreds of these icons of battle stormed through, mercilessly cutting down everything in their path. For these warriors there had never been peace. There was no concept of love or happiness. There was only the smell of blood and the rush of victory.</p>

  <div class="imageset2">
    <a href="./images/drundor_tallon_zek.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_tallon_zek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Tallon Zek" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>The party soon entered a large hall deep within the fortress. The torches burned low and Loral became aware that all had become quiet around them. A powerful warrior of the raiding party stepped in and drew his blade. From the quiet darkness soared a screaming arrow of flame. It struck the warrior and sent him flying through the air, slamming him against the back wall of the room. From the shadows stepped Tallon Zek, nocking another arrow into his ancient bow.</p>

  <p>The raiding party charged in to meet the demi-god. Tallon's 15 foot bow creaked and he let another arrow fly, this one blazing with ice. A mage caught the huge arrow in the chest and immediately fell dead, the four foot arrow still smoking in his chest. Steel rang against the god's armor as the party hacked at the diety of battle. Overwhelmed, Tallon spoke a word of command and fired another barbed arrow. The arrow split into three dozen smaller ones, each finding the mark of one of his attackers. Those hit by the barbed arrows flew back and were pinned to the walls of the hall. The shouts of battle became the cries of the dying as arrow after arrow left Tallon's unholy bow. But the attackers were filled with resolve.</p>

  <p>The healing energy of Tunare flowed from Loral's hands, mending the gaping holes of the evil arrows. Calling upon the strength of the Mother, Loral raised his hands and a shower of blue lights quietly embraced the raiding force. The light enveloped the adventurers near him, mending their wounds and renewing their spirit. The party regrouped and attacked again. This time Tallon Zek fell to their blades.</p>

  <div class="imageset1">
    <a href="./images/drundor_loral_hall.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_loral_hall_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Loral travels deeper into the halls of Drundor" /></a>
  </div>

  <p>Loral stood over the body of the son of Zek. Many of the party tended to the injured and to those fallen in the battle. Others sorted through the treasures found in the hall. Loral could only look at the corpse at his feet and wonder when this would end. The fortress around them continued to bustle with activity. Zek's army was far from defeated. Loral felt old. How far he had gone in the name of Felwithe. How many enemies had he uncovered. How distant he was from his home.</p>

  <p>Leaning heavily on his silver-headed hammer, Loral walked forward. His armor felt heavier than before, pressing deeply in permanent creases on his shoulders. The memories of Coldain blood staining the snow of Velious returned to him as he headed back into the depths of Drundor.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Jalen had been guarding the gates of Felwithe longer than any human had lived. His blade had seen no fewer than five hundred orc necks in his two hundred years of service. He had been guarding the Koada'dal city since it had been founded.  As 
unexpected as it was, he died as he had always hoped, defending the 
city of the elves.</p>

    <p>The guardian of Felwithe never felt the ethereal blade cut through his steel armor and sink into his back. The Daiku Hendin, Gandulak, let the blade slip free as the body of the high elf fell to the ground. Gandulak's face betrayed no emotion as he looked with white pupil-less eyes towards the gates of Felwithe. The ogre pulled his cloak tighter around his large frame and faded back into the darkness. The assassin peered out from under the black hood, his tattooed face hardly visible. In a few hours, the king of Felwithe would be returning from Kelethin. Then Gandulak would strike. The king would be well guarded but none upon the mortal world had seen the skills of a Hendin, a master assassin of Zek. He had no doubt that he would be able to dispose of any guards who might stand in his way. He had no doubt that the king of Felwithe would die this day.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/drundor_war_wraith.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_war_wraith_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The War Wraith" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Loral's vision of the demonic assassin shattered as a War Wraith tore into the priest's party. The cowl on the beast's face made Loral wonder what horror was being hidden that could possibly be worse than the rest of the demon's body. Loral was shocked back into the present when a swing of Moegid's axe 
severed the beast's head from its body with machine-like precision. A shower of thick black blood sprayed against the wall as the corpse fell to the stone floor. The ring of the steel axe echoed down the corridors of Drundor.</p>

    <p>At the top of a large stone staircase, the war party engaged the Daiku 
Hendin Shadowmasters. Armed and armored in black metal forged from the 
mountains of the Plane of War, the Hendin attacked with the power of 
the giants of Kael who lived deep within Kael and also with the dexterity 
and accuracy of the finest elven swordmasters. Each swing led into three more, each feint led to a riposte that had their opponents clutching at their open bellies or slashed throats. Their white eyes burned with the thrill of combat but they never succumbed to the rage of a typical warrior.  Only with the solid coordination of powerful warriors and the combined efforts of many spellwielders were the powerful guardians destroyed.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/drundor_elite.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_elite_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Hendin Shadowmaster" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The adventurers were ragged when he struck.Some leaned heavily on their blades while others sat against the walls. A chill was felt throughout the party. An elven ranger narrowed his eyes and turned towards the dark hallway as a wind flowed past. A black blade burst through his chest. The blade pulled out and cut across, severing the ranger in half to the horror of his companions. Behind the cloud of blood was the grinning face of Vallon Zek, the master of assassins. A bombardment of arrows raced towards the god but before they landed, his visage split into five. Each acting independently, the shades of Vallon cut through the adventurers.</p>

    <p>Loral watched in horror as powerful warriors were carved into pieces before his healing light could keep them alive. In a well coordinated feint, the adventurers focused their attacks on each shade in turn while the others were led down the dark corridors by quickfooted druids. One by one the shades were cut down by the raiding party. Finally, with teeth clenched in vengeance, another ranger of Tunare fired two arrows into the eyes of the son of Zek. The god fell to his knees and then face down onto the stone floor.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/drundor_tallon_zek.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_tallon_zek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Tallon Zek" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>A great roar of anger rumbled through the fortress, numbing the bones of the adventurers and rattling their teeth. The mightiest warriors' knees went weak, hearing the immortal voice of war.</p>

    <p>From deep within the center of the fortress was the first arena ever created. A den of combat, only the best warriors had ever been tested there and few of these ever stepped out. The raiders floated down onto the sandy floor with spells of levitation. The stench of centuries of decay tainted the air and the roaring flame of Rallos Zek's axe lit the arena. The warriors of the Cult stepped 
forward - Dachunker, Grongl, Slivereyes, Torray, and Tera - all representatives 
of different cultures but all the mightiest warriors of Norrath.</p>

    <p>Bright red eyes of hate flared from within the black helm. His body was built from the blood of armies. His burning axe had been forged from the combined rage of one hundred thousand battles. Time slowed down for Loral as Zek's black boots cracked the stone under the sandy floor. With a huge throw, the burning axe soared. With a ring of steel on steel, the head of a human paladin tumbled through the air, a pinwheel of blood in its wake. Loral began chanting in time with six other clerics. A steady stream of healing energy filled the warriors, closing wounds that the horrible axe opened.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/drundor_rallos_zek.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_rallos_zek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Rallos Zek The Warlord" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Loral gained confidence as the battle raged on. While the black armor turned almost every attack, many hit home. The healing waves of Loral and the other clerics flowed, keeping the attacking warriors alive. The sizzling blasts of fire and ice pelted the God of War. The battle was in their favor, until the dead returned to life.</p>

    <p>Loral felt the ground under his feet break open. A rotting claw wrapped in a tarnished silver gauntlet reached out of the ground. All around the arena beasts tore free from the ground around them. Giant boars armored in gold burst through the rear lines of the war party. A score of the winged beasts they had battled earlier dove in, claws tearing into flesh. Quickly the creatures were rallied, taunted, and led astray by the arrows and spells of a rear guard. The slayer of Vallon Zek fired arrow after arrow, piercing the thick hide of a boar and tearing holes in the wings of the war wraiths.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/drundor_beasts_of_zek.jpg"><img src="./images/drundor_beasts_of_zek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The beasts of Zek" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The burning axe spun in the air around the God of War. The blades of the warriors cut deep under his armor. Black blood flowed from a thousand wounds. The female troll, Dachunker, crushed Rallos Zek's knee with a skull headed heavily enchanted mace. He came down hard on one leg and the keen blade of Slivereyes's sword found the edge of a plate and plunged deep into the Warlord's skull. The fortress went silent. The risen beasts stopped their assault and turned towards their master. The impossible had happened. Slivereyes pulled his blade free from the helm and cut again at the God's neck almost severing the head from its shoulders. The red eyes flashed one last time and then went out. The burning axe, still spinning in the air, plunged into the ground 
with a crack of thunder.Rallos Zek the Warlord had been killed.</p>

    <p>Gandulak felt a psychic scream split his mind. Only his thousand years of training kept him from crying out. Something horribly wrong had happened. Twenty other Hendin, all poised outside of Norrath's cities, heard the same cry. Thousands of miles away the giant priests of Zek fell dead, blood streaming from their ears. Gandulak's skin grew cold. Something horrible had occurred within his home world. He drew a small ruby from within the folds of his cloak. He crushed the gem and blew the fragments into the air. A tear in the fabric of space created a doorway back to the Plane of War. Gandulak stepped into the rift and it snapped shut behind him. A minute later King Thearsis Thex came back from his meeting with the council of Kelethin, completely oblivious to the danger that had once stood only a few feet away.</p>

    <p>Loral awoke just before dawn in the inn of New Tanaan. The fragments of his dream slipped away as his eyes took in the room's furnishings. He pulled the thick blanket tighter around him and let his eyes close. The king of Felwithe was safe as were the other leaders of Norrath's people. Rallos Zek had been slain and his assassins had retreated. Loral could afford another hour of sleep.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>It was three hundred and fifty years before the Age of Wonder and Tunaria burned.  Tarlin and his band of fifty rangers marched solemnly but quickly through Kithicor on their way north to Telethin.  They could already see the red smoke in the sky.  Fayspires was on fire.  They stepped out onto what was once rich and grassy lands but now was lifeless rock and ash.  It was on these burnt lands that the elves faced Solusek's demons.</p>

<p>They felt the ground rumble under their feet and the air filled with waves of heat as a massive form approached.  Grezou came upon them on twenty foot wings, his body rippling with muscles and smoking with an internal flame.  He opened his clawed hand and a cone of fire incinerated two of Tarlin's companions.  Holding their ground, the other rangers raised their bows and fired waves of arrows enchanted with ice.  Steam rose from a dozen wounds but the red demon was not finished.</p>

<p>Sixteen more companions were killed before the beast was sent back to the Plane of Fire.  While the troops regrouped and mended their horrible burns, Tarlin stood on a charred hill overlooking the valley that had once been Telethin.  He brushed away a dirty lock of blonde hair that stuck to the grime and sweat of his brow.  Large red shapes dotted the once lush countryside that was now a wasteland of ash.  Tarlin's heart sank. Two hundred more demons remained.  It was Takish Hiz all over again.</p>
  <div class="imageset1">
    <a href="./images/solro_walkway.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_walkway_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The platforms of Ro" /></a>
  </div>
<p>The Planes were alien to Loral in every way.  For a year he had traveled the planes and he felt himself changing mentally and physically.  His armor had shifted around him changing hue from deep blue to gold.  His summoned hammer, Daninulaer the Wraithsbane, pulsed with life in his hand.  Loral felt his grasp on the physical laws of nature slip the further he traveled into the Planes.  His time in the Tower of Solusek Ro was no exception.</p>

<p>Giant stone walkways stood suspended over huge chasms of lava.  Hallways forged from thousands of tons of iron twisted and turned throughout the demonic lair.  Teleportation crystals sent the Norrathian adventurers deeper into the tower, removing all sense of bearing and navigation.  There was nowhere to travel but up, further into the hands of the Burning Prince.  Loral caught a glimpse through a crack in the wall of the outside world.  He became dizzy when he saw the ocean of lava that surrounded the black tower for hundreds of miles.  His mind cleared when he heard the attack of the first of Solusek Ro's guardians.</p>
  <div class="imageset2">
    <a href="./images/solro_guardian.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_guardian_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The A Guardian of Ro" /></a>
  </div>
<p>The demon Xuzl sat within his black hall and waited. For six hundred years, he had remained within the giant iron tower of Solusek Ro, rising like a black needle in the center of the Plane of Fire.  After six hundred years, he remembered the taste of mortals. Although he would now face mortals again, it was not on their land.  It was on his own.</p>

<p>Xuzl stood to his full twenty four foot height and stretched his giant wings to the edges of his hall.  Outside he could hear his minions in battle.  The clash of steel and the blasts of flame flashed through his doorway.  Soon the intruders entered.  He recognized their races from his short stay on Norrath.  All the races were represented, it seemed, armed and armored with great treasures to fill his vaults and arm his own troops.  Xuzl was not a stupid creature, however.  He knew that no ordinary mortals could penetrate this deep into the 
tower of the elder god, Solusek Ro. He knew the strength of the guardians 
these adventurers had defeated.</p>
  <div class="imageset1">
    <a href="./images/solro_xuzl.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_xuzl_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Xuzl" /></a>
  </div>
<p>Two green eyes suspended in blackness were the first signs of this 
mighty foe the mortals glimpsed.  Then the room exploded into orange light as walls of fire roared to life.  Xuzl raised his claw into the air sending waves of fire through the war party.  Only the protective magics of their druids saved them from the searing heat.  Loral ducked behind his shield and felt the enchanted steel melt under the waves of flame.  The adventurers returned the attack firing dozens of enchanted arrows and magical spears of ice onto the beast.  Xuzl's own protective magics stopped many of the attacks, but some pierced his thick hide.</p>

<p>Any conversations among the minions of Solusek Ro's tower ceased when they heard the roar of Xuzl.  A demon among demons, none dared to challenge the creature. He was one of the five guardians of the Burning Prince himself and kept company only with those he commanded.  To hear the beast's cry of agony and rage put fear into the mightiest of Solusek's guardians.</p>
  <div class="imageset2">
    <a href="./images/solro_xuzl_2.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_xuzl_2_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Xuzl" /></a>
  </div>
<p>The smouldering corpse of Xuzl lay on the stone platform of his lair.  His mouth was twisted in agony and anger, bearing horrible fangs.  Loral eyes were fixed on the slain demon.  Many such creatures remained but for a party of mortals to enter the realm of Solusek himself and defeat such a foe was incredible.  Loral felt a twinge of doubt and trouble within the back of his mind.</p>

<p>Binedina stepped forward and handed Loral a round silver shield found in the demon's treasures.  Loral dropped his own ruined shield and slipped this new one onto his arm.  The roar of Xuzl's final death echoed within Loral's ears and the circular shield blazed with fire and then grew still.  A powerful item indeed, Loral thought, and bowed to thank Binedina for her generosity.  She smiled in return and the war party moved on.</p>

<p>Within the highest spire of the tower, at the tip of the spike within the world of lava, Solusek Ro stood.  There was a threat within his home.  His demonic sentinel had been killed. Solusek Ro summoned his remaining guardians close and ordered the remaining four sentinels to stand ready. Solusek, the Burning Prince, felt a sensation he hadn't felt for a thousand years - Fear.</p>

    <p>The final day of the elven city of Fayspires was approaching. The ancient trees of Telethin burned like giant torches, filling the sky with black smoke. Outside of the city, the armies of Tunaria battled the demons of Ro. Inside, the last sages of Fayspires concentrated their powers on the large blue shell that encompassed the city.</p>

    <p>Waves of fire and bolts of electricity bounced off of the protective shell. Then Rizlona entered the wizards guild and all was lost. Once known as a bard with songs that soothed the most troubled heart, the elven woman had been in seclusion for weeks before the gates of Fire had opened. For weeks Solusek Ro whispered to the bard, tempting her with powers and riches beyond any Rizlona had ever known. When she awoke this morning she found a white multi-faceted gem in the center of her floor. The last dark words of her dream rang in her ears. "Take the Dresolik to the wizards."</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/solro_rizlona.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_rizlona_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Rizlona the Traitor" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The eyes of the wizards snapped open when they felt the burning artifact enter their room.Before they could react, the gem flashed and a guardian of Fire appeared in the middle of the wizards' circle. The demon was black faced with red burning eyes and held a double-bladed glyphed axe.Elven magic exploded and blood sprayed on the white marble walls as the last defenses of Fayspires collapsed.</p>

    <p>Rizlona was given a place as a guardian of Solusek Ro in his black tower deep within the Plane of Fire. For five hundred years, her powers grew within her dark chamber. It was within that chamber that she now faced the vengeance of the elves. It was within that chamber that she faced the vengeance of the elves. She was reminded of the last days of Fayspires when she heard the roars of battle just outside her door.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/solro_grezou.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_grezou_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Grezou" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Few had ever seen a horror greater than that of the demon Grezou. Older than the mountains of Kunark, he attacked with a ferocity of pure hatred. Beams of energy shot from his emerald eyes and claws ripped through enchanted armor like paper. The blades of the warriors of the Cult cut deep but the beast was relentless. Calling upon the powers of his home plane of Fire, Grezou reached his arms high. His chanting was interrupted by a blast of absolute cold that tore through the massive chest of the greater demon. Loral turned to see an icy glimmer in Azile's eyes before they returned to normal. Loral shuddered.</p>

    <p>Covered in ash and soot, the raiding party entered Rizlona's chambers. Loral was shocked to see the elven woman armored in gold. His surprise intensified as his companions attacked the woman and she showed her true form.</p>

    <p>Solusek Ro had given many gifts to Rizlona for her part in the destruction of Fayspires. None was more powerful than her new body. Rizlona fell to her hands and knees. Her back arched and elongated. Claws sprang from her finger tips as she grew many times her size. Her armor fell away revealing a thick gold hide of scales. The cracking of bones refitting and reforming made Loral shiver. Huge batlike wings spread above the raiding force. When she raised her head again, Loral stared in shock at the head of a huge golden dragon.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/solro_rizlona_2.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_rizlona_2_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Rizlona Revealed" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Rizlona breathed and a huge column of lava engulfed the front lines of the raiders. Blue rings of protective magic kept the party alive if not unharmed. The party attacked. Powerfully enchanted blades and waves of magical powers ripped into the dragon. Though it felt as if it lasted for days, the battle lasted only a few minutes before the betrayer of Fayspires fell dead.</p>

    <p>Each of the five guardians of Solusek Ro had been defeated. A silence fell over the tower. Bubbling lava and creaking steal were the only sounds as the war party stood in front of the pillar of flame, the gateway to Solusek's antechamber.</p>

    <p>Solusek Ro stood on the raised platform of his throne room. His remaining minions stood with him, horribly powerful protectors feared by Norrath's eldest dragons.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/solro_throneroom.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_throneroom_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Throneroom of Solusek Ro" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Loral thought back to the stories of the exodus of Tunaria. He remembered the cold eyes of his father when Tarlin retold the sad tale. Thousands of elves had died, many of starvation and exposure to the harsh ocean of Tears. While the strongest of the elven armies died upon the fields of Northern Tunaria, many of the sick, the elderly, and the children of the elves died in travel to Faydwer. So weakened were the elves that they had been threatened with extinction at the hands of the Crushbone orcs.</p>

    <p>It was the jealousy and greed of this spoiled child of Fire that taught the elves the meaning of true sadness. The vengeance of Tunaria fed every elf who ever picked up a sword or cast a spell. On this day, vengeance was sated. Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince, was killed within his own lair. Across the Plane of Fire, one last flash of brilliant light from the top of the needle spire of his tower could be seen.</p>

    <p>Loral stood staring at the smoldering corpse of Ro. His hammer, Daninulaer, still hummed in his hand. An unintelligible voice whispered within his mind. The weight of his actions began to sink in. Rallos Zek the Warlord had been killed, protecting Growth from the assault of the frost giants of Kael Drakkal. Solusek Ro, destroyer of Tunaria, had been destroyed, avenging the death of thousands. All across the outer planes, gods, demigods, and their armies had been hunted and killed.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/solro_solusek.jpg"><img src="./images/solro_solusek_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Burning Prince" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Somewhere within the chambers of Ro, a gnome of the raiding party found a lever opening a pit of burning lava. Darkweb the wizard recognized it as a gateway, perhaps deeper into the Plane of Fire.</p>

    <p>Loral stared into the burning pit. He could return to Felwithe this day. He could spend every day from now on in peace, knowing Felwithe was safe. Loral looked deeper into the gateway. There was no logical reason to continue. He had served Tunare more than any had ever expected. There was no need to face further unknown horrors. A single prayer and the powers of the Faithstone of Nature would return him home. Entering the gate would send him to dangers beyond any known by mortals. The laughter of Xuzl the demon echoed in the back of Loral's mind.</p>

    <p>Loral jumped into the pit of Fire.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">155@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p><em>There are ways to try to wrap the mortal mind around the Planes of Power but all of them fail to grasp the entire picture.  Some view the Planes as a scale, with Norrath at the center and the planes spreading down to each end.  The further down one side you travel, the more extreme the Planes become.  On one side you have Innoruuk's domain, the Plane of Hate.  On the other is the realm of Tunare, the Plane of Growth.</em></p>

<p><em>Others see the Planes as a great sphere surrounding us. If we start at the center of this sphere, we see planes similar to our own world of Norrath.  The Plane of Knowledge and its stones of travel, for example, resemble many cities of Norrath.  This pocket-world, however, makes it possible to travel from Halas to Felwithe with fifteen foot steps.  It shortens the distances between two points in our world as if folding our lands to bring these two points together.  Yet the Plane of Knowledge is little different than our own, though it would seem to have encapsulated all of Norrath in a single walled city.  If we look at a further layer we begin to see extremes.  The Plane of Valor and its garrisons of immortal paladins sit on one side, forged in eternal battles against the chaotic beasts of the Glasslands.  The Plane of Torment and its eternal willingness to torture all inside for an eternity rots on the other.  One is unable to see where the black chains that hold up the eternal cells of Torment lead.  Perhaps there are no chains.</em></p>

<p><em>In the furthest of these layers known to us are the elements.  Their deities are beyond our comprehension of good or evil.  They serve our world at its most fundamental layers.  How would we choose to align water when it both feeds our crops with rain or destroys our cities in floods?  How do we choose to fit fire into our primitive beliefs when it keeps our children warm at night or sends armies screaming into the abyss?  And how can we possibly comprehend these worlds were we to visit them?  Is our mind able to even attach images onto what we might fix our eyes upon?  Do we stretch ourselves beyond our own boundaries of reality by even stepping foot inside?  We may never know.  One can only wonder what our mortal lives would face in such levels of extremity.  And one can only wonder what lies beyond.</em></p>

<p><em>- Maelin Starpyre, Grand Librarian of Myrist</em></p>

<p>The air cracked and the portal opened, sucking the hot air of Fire back through.  Loral fell, landing hard on one knee and a hand placed out to balance himself. His eyes were closed.  The air around him singed his skin but the heavy enchantments on his armor protected him from what otherwise would have burned his skin off his bones.  Slowly he looked up and opened his eyes to behold the outer world around him.  What he saw almost sent him into shock.</p>
    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/fire_wall.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_wall_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Wall of Doomfire" /></a>
    </div>
<p>Eternal flames scorched the sky.  The volcanic mountains towered around him, streams of lava pouring from their peaks.  Huge ancient trees burned like a thousand candles over the charred ground in front of him.  From within the dense burning forest he could see the movements of living flame and he could hear the clicking of many legs on the hard cracked ground.  There were enemies about and Loral had no doubt that should they discover him, they would kill him.</p>

<p>A hand gripped Loral's coif and hoisted him off of his feet.  Shaken, he turned and saw the smile and shining eyes of Tera the swordswoman of Halas.  Many battles he had faced with the powerful yet graceful bladewielder, some deep within the Halls of Testing, the ancient temple of the dragons of Velious.  The air cracked again and with a crash of steel on rock stood a monument of power, Grongl the Warlord.  He leaned on the sharp Blade of War and stood.  Three long but sure strides took him to the top of a large obsidian rock.  There he beheld the burning lands of Doomfire.  He sneered.  Loral had little doubt that the General was more at home in these horrid lands than anywhere on Norrath.  The powerful troll leaned the long curved blade on his shoulder and turned.  A cheer from the other members of Lotus Cult flowed across the lands as Grongl held the blade high and pointed it to the north.  From behind the crowd, Binedina and her advisors smiled.  The battle was on.</p>
    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/fire_guardian_golem.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_guardian_golem_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Golem of Fire" /></a>
    </div>
<p>The raiding party moved along the volcanic mountains around the burning forest and to a river of lava.  A great wall split the lands in half, guarded by dozens of Fennin's guardians.  Their burning spears glittered in the dark smoke.  The raiding party floated onto the upper platforms and in a score of fierce battles they breached the walls and approached the dark side of the burning lands, closer to the city of Fennin Ro.</p>

<p>The party met the minions of Fennin Ro in force.  Huge elemental flames, hundreds of times stronger than those that walked Norrath, unleashed waves of lava over the warriors.  All about the skies were great winged demons, the fire reflecting off of their thick red skin.  Some were as large as the guardian, Xuzl.  Some were even larger.</p>
    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/fire_spider.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_spider_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Babnoxis" /></a>
    </div>
<p>The horrible sounds of Doomfire grew quiet as they approached a narrow bridge suspended over a chasm of lava.  Six scouts moved forward, their eyes peering into the smoke ahead.  Without warning, a twelve foot spike, pierced through the chest of their leader, pinning him to the ground.  Out of the smoke came an vision out of Loral's deepest nightmares, Babnoxis the Spider Queen.  Over thirty feet high and almost ninety feet across from her massive legs, the giant spider roared down upon the party.  Arrows skimmed across her thick black shell <!-- candy -->and the spider countered with streams of venom from shining fangs.  A dreadful scream filled the heads of the raiders, the ancient voice of the spider queen, spewing forth malice and terror in a language five thousand years dead.  Loral felt a rage build inside him.  He held his hand towards the black demon-queen and called upon Tunare's Condemnation.</p>

<p>The roar of Xuzl filled Loral's head as energy poured out of his hand and blasted into the thick shell.  The shell cracked and Babnoxis screamed in Loral's mind, bringing him to his knees.  Loral heard the laugh of Xuzl behind the scream of Babnoxis, the shield burning upon Loral's arm.  Loral clenched his jaw and stood to behold the battle.  The enchanted blades of the Cult, forged in the outer planes themselves, cut deep into the joints of Babnoxis's living armor. With a final cry to her lord, the ancient beast fell dead.</p>
    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/fire_demon.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_demon_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Guardian of the Ring of Fire" /></a>
    </div>
<p>A voice boomed out across the burning lands and the council of flame was unleashed.  The greatest of Fennin's creation, the inner circle of Fennin's most powerful and loyal demons, roared to life and fell in from the burning sky.  Falling back to a narrow bridge, the war party faced each of the demons in turn.  Azobian the Darklord, Blazzax the Omnifiend, Hebabbilys the Ragelord, Javonn the Overlord, Reaxnous the Chaoslord, and Omni Magus Crato attacked the party one by one in two horrible hours of battle.  Columns of flame could be seen for miles.  The thick obsidian ground broke apart swallowing and crushing those unfortunate enough to step near.  Loral clutched his symbol of Tunare close, sending beams of healing light onto the fallen when he could.  All about him the battle raged.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/fire_fennin_chamber.jpg"><img src="./images/fire_fennin_chamber_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Chambers of Fennin Ro" /></a>
    </div>

<p>The war party never broke ranks.  Each member protected the next as the horrible beasts attacked.  The perfect synergy of magic power, enchanted steel, icy arrows, and blue waves of life was beyond the chaotic strategies of Fennin's high council.  With a final spear of ice ripping through the torso of the great Omni Magus, the final arch demon fell dead.  Deep in his chambers of burnt stone, Fennin Ro stood alone.  The war party approached.</p>

<p>Two weeks passed.  Loral sat at a great oak table in the library of Tanaan, reading over the memoirs of Maelin Starpyre.  Fennin Ro, elder god of Fire, had been killed.  While the rush of victory was hard to suppress, Loral could not help but feel a coming darkness.  He remembered the speakings of Ciric, his Erudite mentor, about balance and the complementary relationships of the gods.  How could the balance of Norrath be sound when such a great force had been slain?  As if in reply, Loral felt the shield leaning against his chair grow hot.  The grating laughter of Xuzl hissed in the back of Loral's mind.  Loral would return to Qeynos to speak with Ciric on these matters, but Loral had one more conversation to have first - a conversation with a demon.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>The room was small, no more than twelve feet across, with a desk, a rug, and a bed. On a chair opposite the door was the artifact, covered with a black cloth. Loral's eyes never left the object as he closed and bolted the door. Loral couldn't help but wonder if it was the last time he would ever see the outside world again.</p>
    <p>With a small knife, Loral carved runes of protection into the wood of the door and into the supporting beams. He used the dust of crushed peridots and globes of summoned water to make a shimmering paste that he filled into the carved runes. A prayer to his goddess and a wave of his hand made the runes shine with an internal light. Loral prayed again, this time surrounding his body with a magical shell of protection from both physical, mental, and elemental attacks. He did not know what he might face in this encounter, it was best to be prepared. With his protection spells in place, Loral was ready.</p>
    <p>Loral pulled back the cloth and revealed the circular shield. It appeared dull and scarred from thousands of battles. It was an artifact of the Plane of Fire, a shield that held magical powers beyond the understanding of mortals. It had been forged before the existence of man or elf, a weapon of power in a war long past. There was something deeper, however. During its last battle the shield had captured a piece of the spirit it once protected. Loral closed his eyes and began to speak.</p>
    <p>"Awaken, Xuzl." Loral felt a flash of heat as the shield came alive. Loral imagined the shield expanding into a gateway, its oily surface appearing as a black liquid. A red claw extended out. A blast of hot sulphuric air blew Loral's hair back. He could feel the beast enter the room, over two thousand pounds of muscled hatred and fire.</p>
    <p>Loral heard the thud of Xuzl's hoof hitting the wooden floor. He felt the mass of the beast all around him. The floor seemed to sink under the demon's weight. Loral heard leather wings unfold around him, filling the entire room. He could smell the beast's burning breath beating down on him. Through his closed eye lids he could see the burning green eyes of Solusek's guardian. In a basement of a bar in Felwithe Loral sat in front of one of the most dangerous creatures ever to step foot upon Norrath.</p>
    <p>Xuzl's voice boomed. "At last we speak, elf. I wondered when this moment would occur." Xuzl laughed, a sound mixed of screaming children and steel scratching on stone. Loral could feel Xuzl's mind probing into Loral's, seeking control.</p>
    <p>"Stand down, Xuzl." Loral spoke, putting as much strength into his voice as he could. "I know what you are and I have seen your powers before. You shall not have control over me." Loral held his hand up revealing the black oval scar on his palm - a scar it the shape of an eye. "I have been possessed before, demon. I have tasted the breath of evil from my own mouth and I shall not taste it again."</p>
    <p>Xuzl considered the scar for a moment. "A beast of Innoruuk gave you this," the demon spoke with a voice both deep and gratingly sharp. "The Prince of Hate never had much patience. Your resistance to me is no concern. In time, priest, you will feel the strength I can give to you and perhaps you will see things differently."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps I should toss you into the pits of Lavastorm."</p>
    <p>Xuzl laughed. "Perhaps some red-skinned goblin would find me there. Perhaps his mind would not be as strong as your own and perhaps I would be released faster than I thought." Loral felt his heart sink at the demon's logic.</p>
    <p>"I am a patient one, priest." Xuzl continued, "I have many powers to give and many tales to tell. I will not lie to you as Innoruuk's fiend did. It is far more entertaining to watch you burn by your own twisted truth."</p>
    <p>"And what truth is that?"</p>
    <p>"The truth that you do more to damage your world than you do to protect it. Do you think you've saved Norrath by killing Fennin Ro? Do you think no one will take the throne? Can you not see the great imbalance you have created? The Planes are a scale, pasty elf, and you just took all of the weight off of one side. It is only a matter of time before the world crumbles around you." Again came the steel-scraping laugh.</p>
    <p>"I have tasted the blood of your grandfather, elf." Xuzl's heat grew as he spoke. "I heard him scream out to a goddess that would not listen when I ripped him in half and crushed his skull in my teeth. A thousand of your kind I have killed, but your own self destruction may be the most entertaining death I have seen."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps, demon. But for now you will serve the will of Tunare. You will serve as my hand, as I serve as hers. And when your time of service is up, I will return you to your fiery pits with the other vermin that infest your world."</p>
    <p>Loral opened his eyes. The room felt no different than it had when he first entered. The demon was gone. The scarred shield sat quietly across from him. Loral picked it up and slipped it onto his arm, feeling its warmth.</p>
    <p>Loral considered the danger of such an item.  To have the voice of one so versed in the ways of the outer planes was a benefit beyond measure, even if the voice was so foul as Xuzl's. If the will of Tunare is served and the protection of the elves is sound, the methods may not be questioned. It would not be the first time Loral had fought next to the hand of darkness in order to serve the greater good and it would not be the last.</p>
    <p>Loral climbed up the steps of the bar's basement and into the city of Felwithe. The demon sat comfortably on his arm.</p>

<p>From the worn leather-bound journal of Loral Ciriclight buried on a shelf of infinite books in New Tanaan</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/torment_landscape.jpg"><img src="./images/torment_landscape_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Plane of Torment" /></a>
    </div>

<p>It was 3168 in the Age of Turmoil.  Only a few months earlier we found that all of Norrath's lands had been folded closer, connected to they planar city of New Tanaan in the Plane of Knowledge.  I remember how strange and wonderful it was traveling a short twelve steps between Felwithe and Halas, a trip that took six weeks by foot and boat.  Now these portals have entrenched themselves into every aspect of our society, changing a thousand years of culture and economics by the removal of geographical boundaries.  How quickly we have accepted these planar gateways and now treat them as a dirt path through the woods or an oak wheel on a cart.  They are commonplace to us now and few of us can ever recall the world without them.</p>

<p>Now powerful adventurers have entered the Plane of Time.  What changes will we find as hunters and treasure seekers begin tugging on the strings that tie together our past and future?  The swing of an enchanted blade may sever the chain our very existence or release horrors beyond imagination.  How can we possibly understand the ramifications of our actions?  The life of a quarter of a million Erudites could be snuffed out like the flame of a candle.</p>

<p>Why do we go?  I find myself asking this question often.  Is it the will of Tunare?  In the great balance of the outer planes, her realm and the hells of nightmare and disease cannot threaten each other.  Is it the will of the church and the safety of Felwithe?  I doubt the demons of these deep planes could comprehend such an intrusion.  We cannot be sure the demonkind could survive in our world at all.  The pollen of a flower may be as toxic to them as Trakanon's breath is to us.  Is it the thrill of adventure that pushes us to these outer worlds?  After seeing the darkness within some of these terrible places, one must question the sanity of such a motivation.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/torment_building.jpg"><img src="./images/torment_building_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Plane of Torment" /></a>
    </div>

<p>Few questions in life have simple answers.  Many variables drive our actions.  I cannot say why my friends and I entered the Plane of Torment but whatever the reasons, there we were.</p>

<p>I had seen the world of the banished in a vision some months previous, but I was unprepared for the feeling of sheer hopelessness as we beheld the horrible world.  There are very real dangers in this prison world but it is the mental terror that is the most dangerous.  Were it not for my stout friends, Stonehewer, Semidil, Kabbal, Juror, Vuldar, and Norque, I would have fled as soon as my eyes beheld the blood red sky and black sea.</p>

<p>The air in torment was thick and hot.  Though breathable, our bodies revolted with each forced breath, rejecting the smell and taste of blood and decay.  Faint screams, moans, and unsettling laughter rolled across the black water.  The cells of Torment, rooms suspended from chains that led up into the red haze of the infinite sky, held beasts older than Norrath.  Demons who spend their days within their own insanity, hating all life itself and wishing for the destruction of all life including their own.  With trepidation our party took our first steps onto the first of hundreds of suspended walkways.</p>

<p>The deafening scream of the bloodravens was our first welcome to this hell.  The psychic attack drowned out any ability to call upon our magical powers.  The beasts flew on oily black wings.  They stared at us with bloody eye-less sockets and filled our minds with visions of endless terror.  They ripped into our skin with a power and ferocity far beyond their size.  While our magical powers were limited, the blades of Stonehewer, Kabbal, and Semidil quickly cut down the demonic birds, their screaming fading along with whatever life force they had.</p>

<p>Within the mental screams of the eyeless bloodravens I heard the laughter of Xuzl.  The demonic entity trapped in my shield showed me just how unprepared we mortals were to even think we could understand what we were seeing.  The demon projected his feelings of elation woven into the thicker fabric of horror.  Even with his tauntings, his protections saved my life.</p>

<p>The Kaniz Hunter and Boruk Ravager made up for their lack of subtlety with pure physical power.  Like most creatures of the outer planes, their crude language was intermixed with telepathic visions of their intent to rip off our limbs and feast on our blood.  To feel the pleasure these unholy beasts felt at the thought or our own torture is a mental paradox beyond what mortal minds should face.  To see ones self as so alien a being is terrible indeed.</p>

<p>Thank Tunare that their physical forms were natural enough for blades and spells to combat.  Kabbal's great axe cut into the hoof of one, breaking the bone at an odd angle above its twisted backwards knee.  Far from defeated, the beast sunk its claws deep into Kabbal's thigh ripping into flesh and muscle.  My own prayers to Tunare sealed the mortal wound and Stonehewer's blazing greatsword beheaded the demon.</p>

    </div>

<p>With the finest elven swordsmanship, Semidil plunged his blades into the second demon's chest to the hilt.  Semidil stared at the blazing red eyes of the demon, expecting the massive creature to fall over dead.  The Boruk Ravager laughed and punched the warrior in the face, sending him skidding across the stone walkway.  A barrage of magic assaulted the creature, waves of poisons, disease, and clouds of darkness engulfed it as both Juror and Norque chanted.  The red eyes went white as blindness took over the demon.  Stonehewer promptly beheaded the second beast, seeming to prefer this method of dispatching the demons of Torment.</p>

<p>We traveled for four days along the suspended walkways of the prison world.  Succumbing to curiosity, I ventured close to one of these buildings and what I saw made me wish I had not.  I do not know how demons come to exist, whether simply created by their god or perhaps the manifestation of imperfections in our own world.  I do know that no natural force could have created the Constructs.  The beast was a mass of pulsating veiny flesh.  It dragged its weight with a number of swollen tentacles, each ending in a mouth lined with needle-like teeth.  It had no visible eyes, but three of the larger tentacles turned my way and I heard a gurgling hiss.  With uncanny speed for such an unwieldy beast the hideous creation attacked and it wasn't alone.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/torment_constructs.jpg"><img src="./images/torment_constructs_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Constructs" /></a>
    </div>

<p>Kabbal severed three of the hideous mouthed tentacles from the beast with a swing of his axe.  Daninulaer, my summoned hammer, smashed in the skull of another wolf-headed demon.  A third, seeing it was out numbered, grabbed Semidil by his chain tunic and in a flash of black light, the two disappeared.  Two more demons roared in and with the tentacle Construct still quite alive, our luck had run out.</p>

<p>Our astral lines snapped tight as the claws ripped into us.  The lines dragged our spiritual projections back into the Plane of Tranquility.  There was a moment of panic until we saw Semidil unconscious next to us.  Mentally exhausted but safe, we ended our exploration into Torment the only way we could have, defeated. Other adventurers had been trapped, doomed to an eternity of pain and misery. We did return, however, with a tale to tell and a little smarter for the experience.</p>

<p>Two years ago the Shissar gave me the greatest gift I had ever been given and then ripped it out of my mind like a barbed arrow.  For two days they injected sixty years of a life I had never lived into me.  I fell in love with and married a woman who has never existed.  Sometimes in that place between sleep and consciousness I can still feel her next to me, her hand draped across my chest.  Then I awaken further and remember that she was nothing but a dark electricity burned into my mind and I weep.  Sometimes I hear my son's laugh in the streets of the bazaar and I turn with a smile before my mind reminds me that he was never born.  For two years I have had to struggle with the acceptance that none of it was real.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if I have left the ancient laboratories of the Shissar warlocks at all.  I wonder if I am still living my own life or living the sixty year lie they wrapped around me.  One thing convinces me that the life I live now is real; I never questioned the one the Shissar fed to me.  I enter the Planes for a few reasons, but there is one strong one I do not wish to admit.  I go to the Planes because it is the only place that feels real.  The surrealism of the outer planes wraps around me like the embrace of a mother and for just a moment I remember the feel of Elandra's hand in mine.  That is usually just before the demons come.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p><em>For six years I have served the Emerald Guardians.  I was proud to wear their leaf on my cloak and eager to serve the people who had felt such torment at the fall of Takish Hiz.  It was a joy to travel to the far reaches of Tunaria as an agent of the Guardians.  It may now be my greatest pain.</em></p>

<p><em>Scores of orcs have fallen to my arrows.  The goblin witch, Teshtuzu, spit out her last curse when my blade crossed her throat.  I traveled to Diren's Hold and defeated the great bear, Trapmaw.  But then my duties changed.  I was sent west to find a Tier'Dal Enchanter and his prisoner, an elven maiden whose mind had been broken with his poisoned words.  I found them at an inn in Highbourne.  The Tier'Dal's wicked magics ceased when I cut off his hands and then his head.  A stab of my guardian's blade ended the screams of the mind-warped elven maiden.  It wasn't until her hand reached out to her dead lover that the truth reached me.  Charmed vessels do not cry over fallen masters.</em></p>

<p><em>Troubled, I followed new instructions to head south through the desert of Ro to recover an artifact of the church of Tunare stolen by a fallen priestess.  It took me weeks to find her, deep in the swamps of Guk on a ruined pyramid of an old, dark god.  She was in prayer to whatever dark god she now served when my first arrow tore into her side.  A wolf-shaped demon attacked me from the shadows.  The elven enchantments of my blades ripped into its ghostly form and it burst into smoke.  Tesarin Moonstrider clutched the chalice to her breast, her prayers never ceasing, even when I plunged my thin scimitar through her chest to the hilt.  It was difficult to understand the prayers she whispered as life left her.  One thing rang clear.  They were prayers to Tunare.</em></p>

<p><em>For six years I have been an agent of the Fayspires.  Through bureaucratic double-talk and false patriotism they have turned me into a weapon.  I believed I was a ranger of Tunaria, serving the will of the Mother.  Tunare has left Tunaria and left behind the salted earth of a once-great elven empire.  Ranger is not the right word for what I am.  The world is not black and white.  I am Tarlin the Grey.</em></p>
<p><em>I am an assassin.</em></p>
<p>- From the journals of Tarlin of Tunaria</p>

<p>Loral pushed the worn leather journal across the table, knocking over his glass and spilling his red wine on the table.  The words hit him like a hammer.  It shattered a fog that had surrounded him since the days he left for Kunark.  Their missions had never been to rescue the elf maiden, Fironia Vie, but to fill the treasure-rich lands of Kunark with those who served their interests.  It had all been a lie.</p>

<p>For decades Loral had followed the church's orders, traveling throughout Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and now the outer planes.  Their motives or goals were never clear.  Loral had never asked for justification. He was trained to follow the will of the church.  Now images of his past flashed into his mind as the words of his father, written five hundred years earlier, rang in his ears.  The death of the Overking Bathezid, the death of Venril Sather himself, the vampyre Xalgoz, General V'Ghera, Trakanon, Nagafen, Lady Vox, King Tormax, Innoruuk, Cazic Thule, Terris Thule, Bertoxxulous, Rallos Zek and his sons, all of them had been slain with Loral's assistance.  Hundreds had been slain to further the goals of the council of Felwithe, expanding their lands, their influence, and their coffers.</p>

<p>Loral had been their weapon.</p>

<p>He left the city of Tanaan at once and traveled to Felwithe with only one thought in his mind.  He must face Yeolarn.</p>

<p>The stone door slid open, splashing the room with harsh light.  Loral walked in, silouetted black against the white light of day behind him.  His explosive entrance sent the guards' hands to the hilts of their blades.  They softened when they recognized Loral, not because they no longer thought he was a threat, but because there was little they could do about it if he was.</p>

<p>Allia Moondancer smiled when she recognized Loral under the hood of his cloak but the smile dropped when she saw the fury in his blue eyes.  As unthinkable as it was, Allia saw the truth of this visit.  If this conversation did not go well, elven blood would spill in the church of Tunare.</p>

<p>"How long have I been an assassin of the church, Yeolarn?"  Loral roared.  "How long have you built me into the dagger of Felwithe?  How long did it take you to decide to feed me to the Shissar?  How surprised were you when I returned?"</p>

<p>Loral stopped dangerously close to the platform where Yeolarn stood.  The Tunarian priests had the words of their battlemagic on their lips, but few had great expectations for their success.  They foresaw their magics flowing off of Loral's enchanted armor like water.  They saw his ethereal hammer swing out impossibly fast, crushing the steel helmets of the guards along with the skulls inside.  They saw his magic, a chaotic magic fueled by a demon some had whispered, rip through them like thousands of blades.  All of the priests stood tense and ready.  All but Yeolarn, who leaned heavily on his staff as if Loral's questions added weight to his shoulders.</p>

<p>"We sent you to Ssraeshza because we could not send an army.  We sent you because you ARE an army.  How long have we battled Crushbone?  How long have we kept the orcs in check when you alone could kill every orc in Crushbone in two hours?  We do not send you to Crushbone because the orcs are necessary for the stability of Felwithe.  You are an agent of the church.  We send you to the far reaches of the land.  We send you into the pits of hell and we send you alone."</p>

<p>The scarred shield burned on Loral's arm.  Deep in his mind he heard the whispers of Xuzl.  <em>THEY HAVE BETRAYED YOU, ELF, AS THEY DID YOUR FATHER.  RAISE YOUR HAND AND SHOW THEM WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.  GIVE THEM THE JUSTICE THEY DESERVE.</em>.</p>

<p>"Felwithe is no single entity, it has no single mind," Yeolarn continued.  "The motivations of each council member is as different as we are from the Tier'Dal.  Some sent you to Luclin to see if Felwithe was in danger.  Others sent you to die.  We have many agents in the lands, each acting independently.  Some are killed.  Some break under the strain and turn against the Mother herself.  But you return.  You always have."</p>

<p>Loral felt his skin set fire from within.  <em>RELEASE ME.  RELEASE ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU VENGEANCE.  YOU CAN WALK AWAY WHILE THE CORRUPTION OF FELWITHE BURNS BEHIND YOU.  DESTROY THIS CITY THAT SO INSULTS THE NATURE OF TUNARE.</em>  Loral clenched his fists Yeolarn continued.</p>

<p>"Fironia Vie's name was a banner for our interests in Kunark.  Venril Sather needed to die, whether a threat to Felwithe or not.  Emperor Ssraeshza needed to die, whether he would have left his temple or not.  We send you because there is evil that must be destroyed.  It is not about the safety of Felwithe, it is about good and evil.  It is about the will of Tunare."</p>

<p>Loral's head swam.  Behind his eyes Xuzl screamed for release.  Visions filled Lorals mind of Xuzl exploding from the church and burning all of Felwithe in a great ball of fire.</p>

<p>"You knew the truth before you walked in that door.  You act in the interests of Tunare, in the interests of good.  You have done so before and you will do so again."</p>

<p>Yeolarn handed Loral a scroll sealed in wax.</p>

<p>"Takish Hiz has been found."</p>

<p>Silence filled Loral's mind as both he and the demon within his cursed shield considered this news.  Then the voice of Xuzl screamed again in a tongue thousands of years older than the elves.  Loral silenced him with a single thought, a single promise.</p>

<p>He would release Xuzl in Felwithe.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>It had been seven years since Loral had retired from his days of adventure, but he had one last job to do.  Loral walked slowly around the cavern, carefully inspecting every detail of the large room. Any flaw in its construction could spell disaster for those within, and eventually all of Norrath. Two large ballistae, huge crossbows with bolts two meters long, were bolted to the floor corners of the room. Seeing these siege weapons in such a small room would make no sense to any outside observer, but to Loral, they were critically important. Loral checked the chains that ran across the floor ending at two huge stone wheels on the far end.  Loral looked to the two armored barbarians that stood to the sides of the large wheels, iron hammers slung over their shoulders.  He turned and looked to the two elves that manned the giant crossbows.  The resolve of these warriors would be more critical than the flawless engineering of the room and its furnishings. They were about to see something few mortals ever did, and fewer still ever lived to talk about it.</p>

    <p>Loral took out a black gem from a pouch on his belt. A single word activated the priceless gem, and once activated it could never be deactivated.  The huge crossbows, the unbreakable chains, and the strength of the warriors would all fail if the gem was not activated properly. Each was a piece of a large puzzle, each had to be put in at just the right time or they would all die.  Loral took a deep breath.  It was time to release Xuzl. Loral took the battered shield off of his back and set it in the center of the floor.</p>

    <p>"Awaken Xuzl. You are free."</p>

    <p>A vibration filled the room, rattling the chains on the floor and drawing concerned looks from the guards. The edge of the shield began to glow and then burst into flame. The circle expanded outward forming a large pool of fire. A sudden blast of hot air filled the room as the portal to the Plane of Fire opened.</p>

    <p>A red claw reached out of the pool and gripped the stone floor. Another claw followed the first and the two heaved up the rest of the demon's bulk from the pit. Xuzl's green eyes beheld the small priest.  The foolish priest had kept his word.  Xuzl was free.</p>

    <p>Upon blackened hooves, Xuzl stood above the fiery pit.  He stretched his full fifteen feet height expanding his wings to the edges of the room.  He beheld the priest again with his burning green eyes, he hissing laughter filling Loral's mind.</p>

    <p>"Ganthalrom"</p>

    <p>The word of command activated the black gem. The shine from Loral's earrings and rings faded.  Two magical gems that lit the room darkened immediately but the four torches of the room stayed lit.  The demon felt the shell of invisible protection surrounding his huge frame disappear. He called upon a column of lava to incinerate the priest but no fire came. All of his magical powers were gone along with all other magic in the room.  All magic within one hundred feet of the black gem ceased to exist.</p>

    <p>It mattered little to Xuzl. Even without his powerful magic, the demon was stronger than a the Ice Giants of Permafrost. He could crush all five of these pitiful creatures with a single stone. That was when he noticed the ballistae.</p>

    <p>"Fire"</p>

    <p>Two huge bolts, each a six foot steel rod tipped with a black barbed tip, tore through Xuzl's arms. The huge chains, attached to the end of the bolts, raced up the ground and criss crossed Xuzl's massive chest. Xuzl roared and the guardians felt their knees grow week. One of the elves manning the ballistae fell to the ground, his hands covering his head.</p>

    <p>The two barbarians bashed out two logs that held the stone wheels in place with their hammers. Behind the wall, a four ton stone weight fell. A network of levers and pulleys behind the wall pulled the chains tight around the beast. Four huge chains wrapped the demon around the chest, crushing the bones of the beast's wings.  Three more wrapped around its legs.  Xuzl was pinned to the wall, the chains held tight by the huge stone weight.  The strength of twenty frost giants could not break their bond.</p>

    <p>Loral had spent years studying the powers of extraplanar creatures and in almost all cases they had three powerful weapons; physical strength, magical abilities, and psionics . Two of the demon's three weapons had been removed.  Only one remained.</p>

    <p>While magical energies were drawn from the outer planes or their gods, even from one plane to another, the psychic abilities of outer planar demons came from a different source.  Unlike magical energy which would be stopped by the black gem, psychic energy worked on the internal powers of the mind and would be unaffected. Sometimes these psychic effects were subtle. Xuzl's was not.</p>

    <p>The elf that manned the left ballistae screamed, a scream so violent that his throat ripped itself apart from the strain. Blood flowed from his eyes and ears, running rivers down his cheeks. Loral felt his stomach heave when he heard a small pop and the elf fell dead to the stone floor, his brain crushed under the might of Xuzl's powers.</p>

    <p>The barbarian to the beast's left took out a large black shining helm he had hanging on his back. The helm cost almost as much as the black gem, its shape forged from instructions over five thousand years old. It was built from a material known to block the mental intrusions of the Shissar and was used as armor by the ogres of Old Norrath. The ogres used the armor to keep psychic intrusion out, but this helm was designed to keep it in. Most importantly, the power of the helm to block psychic abilities was not magical but natural.  It would work within the stones antimagic shell.</p>

<p>The ogre put the helm over Xuzl's huge head, the form fitting perfectly around the demon's black horns and covered the green burning eyes of the demon with smooth black metal. A latch clamped the helm shut, tight against the creature's head.  Loral let out a sigh of relief.  Had the helm not fit, they would have all died as their elven companion had.</p>

    <p>Xuzl felt his senses crash down. He could no longer hear the thoughts and emotions of the attackers. He could not send out his psychic tendrils into their minds. He could not summon his powers to call forth waves of lava or reopen a gateway back to his home world.  He could not even see.  For the first time in fifty thousand years of life, the arch-demon Xuzl was afraid.</p>

    <p>Loral watched the chest muscles of the huge beast flex against the strain of the giant chains. He saw the black claw clench into a fist and extend as if reach for something, anything. The chains pinned the creature completely to the wall, his arms wrapped around him in some obscene embrace.  Xuzl's roar got softer and softer, turning into an inhuman whimper as the chains tightened around his chest. Loral could not see Xuzl's eyes under the black helm, but the whimper was one that brought no hatred into Loral's mind.</p>

    <p>For the first time since contemplating the trapping of this unholy beast, Loral had doubt. He would have thought this feeling was one of Xuzl's psychic tricks, but with the black helm in place he knew such a trick was impossible. Who was he to trap so mighty a creature? He had orchestrated and carried out a plan to trap this beast forever within this tomb. What right did he have to do so?</p>

    <p>Another vision filled Loral's head. One of the beast Xuzl plucking an armored female elf off of a hill far away in the lands of Tunaria. The beast flew high, crushing the screaming paladin in an immortally strong grip. With a smile and a chuckle, the demon bit off her screaming head and swallowed it whole.</p>

    <p>Loral's vision snapped back to the trapped beast, faceless under the black helm. To remove such a creature from the world of Norrath was necessary. To have such a power free in the mortal world or even the planes was against all that was good.</p>

    <p>Loral and his remaining companions left the chamber, sealing the door behind them. After a few hours, the torches burned themselves out and the room was black.  The only sound was the forced breathing of the demon, his chest too constrict to scream or even speak.</p>

    <p>Loral walked past the illusionary treasure room filled with a king's ransom in platinum and magical items. Two stone guardians, built and enchanted by gnomish arch-mages stood motionless, protecting the room from intrusion forever. Should any adventurers get this far, an almost impossible feat, they would think the treasure room to be the final victory.  None would suspect the giant rock on the opposite wall to contain the unholy beast Xuzl, and his eternal tomb.</p>

<p>Thoughts of the demon flowed out of Loral as the thick liquid of the potion of forgetfulness flowed down his throat. In moments, he and his three remaining companions would forget the entire experience. It was the only way to ensure their secret remained so. All three stepped out of the maze-like catacombs and into the inner chambers of the Church of Tunare. Soon all three were walking through the streets of Felwithe, the encounter and its location already forgotten.</p>

    <p>None of them remembered that a few hundred feet below the streets of the elven city of Felwithe, chained to the wall and bathed in pitch blackness, hissed the eternal breath of Xuzl the demon. The demon, however, would never forget.</p>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">1044@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>Loral sat in a dwarven tavern outside of the city of Kaladim. He drank the thick liquid of dwarven ale, the sweetest and weakest the bartender had available but still far too thick for Loral's taste. He spent very little time in this area nowadays, but rumors of the Wayfarers had him looking for information. This band of treasure-seekers seemed to appear out of nowhere, quickly building camps across Norrath. Rumors spoke of the treasures they promised to any who explored newly discovered dens of evil. Having heard of the location of the Wayfarer camp from a drunken dwarf just before passing out, Loral closed his leather-bound journal, returned it to a pouch at his side, and left for the camp.</p>

    <p>On reaching the Wayfarer's camp, he was immediately shocked by the sheer volume and excitement of the people around it. Hundreds of adventurers milled about.   Some were young and inexperienced and others were obviously seasoned and powerful. The Wayfarers themselves were as diverse as those who sought them out. Dark elves and wood elves chatted together while barbiarians and trolls toasted each other with giant flagons of mead.  It pleased Loral to see such diversity.  This breaking of racial barriers hadn't been seen on Norrath since the fall of the Combine empire.</p>

    <p>Joining the Wayfarers was not difficult and Loral was quickly given a task to perform. Loral traveled to an exhumed graveyard in the cursed forest of Lesser Faydark where a network of caverns had been found under a lost cemetery. One of the graves had broken into a pit leading into the caverns below.  Many adventurers gathered around the excavation and the remains of dozens of bodies were scattered about. The whole hill smelled of death.  Loral looked with trepidation into the pit.</p>

    <p>A strong clap on Loral's back gave him a jolt and the stout dwarf Stonehewer laughed at the expression of shock on Loral's face. Juror the shaman smiled behind the dwarf with two of his bladeswingers, Llyan and Vamcill by his side. Kaylessa, one of Felwithe's adventuring enchanters and friend to the guild of Healers, approached as well. Their party was ready. With one last prayer to Tunare, Loral and his companions dropped into the pit.</p>

    <p>Thick liquids of tainted life and mists of tormented souls seeped into the broken earth, filling the rats, bats, and spiders inside with a lust for blood and fearsome strength. Jointed legs covered in coarse hair dragged the bulk of huge spiders through the caverns. The white sightless eyes of giant rats turned towards the party and lines of diseased drool spattered to the ground. As soon as the mutated beasts sensed the adventuring party, they attacked.</p>

    <p>The party fought the masses of tainted beasts for hours. Powerful magics broke open the shells of the huge spiders. Thick lumps of black gore fell onto the ground. Llyan pierced the boated bodies of the giant rats, pinning them squealing to the earth. The chanting of the party's spellcasters was almost continuous as wave after wave of the creatures vomited forth from the infected caverns. As grotesque as these creatures were, the party soon faced a far more dangerous foe.</p>

    <p>Standing calmly, the slight female figure could easily have been mistaken for an elf except for the sickly pale skin. She stood and beheld them calmly, her eyes gleaming silver in the torch light. Her grey lips twisted into a smile, revealing long fangs. She attacked with unnatural speed and went right for Loral's throat. Were it not for Stonehewer's quick movements she would have torn it open.</p>

    <p>Stonehewer cleaved his firey blade towards her back. She twisted quickly avoiding the blade and swiped a claw at the dwarven knight, tearing four deep gashes into his face. Loral sealed the deep wounds with a prayer to Tunare. Juror cupped his hands and a roar of tiny insects engulfed the vampiress. Vamcill's red-runed scimitar cut down hard, splitting her open from her shoulder down to her hip.</p>

    <p>Two caverns away, Aviatis opened his own silver eyes, his telepathic bond to the Scion broken. He turned and fixed his eyes on his two black-robed advisors. They nodded silently and stepped out into the cavern entrance.</p>

    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/mistmoore_trueborn.jpg"><img src="./images/mistmoore_trueborn_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Trueborn" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>As much as the Scion Caretaker's attack had shaken the party, the two Trueborn's were far more sinister. They were a head taller than the party's biggest member and covered in thick black robes deeply embroidered in red and gold. Their gaunt faces peered out from under the deep hoods with sunken cheeks and dead eyes. One raised his palms towards the party and waves of flames roared onto the party. The other drew a wicked blade engraved with skulls and coated with his own black blood.  Stonehewer cut at blade wielder but the Trueborn sidestepped faster than the dwarf could see.</p>

    <p>Stonehewer grunted, pulled his blade back, and stabbed deep into the vampire's stomach. The vampire smiled, gripped Stonehewer's wrist, and with inhuman strength forced the blade out of his body. Blue waves flowed from the second Trueborn's hands and the mortal wound sealed.</p>

    <p>Stonehewer grunted again at this bad turn of luck. With one Trueborn healing the other, they would outlast the party's attacks. Stonehewer fixed the solution in typical dwarven style by smashing the spellcasting vampire in the mouth with his armored fist. The Trueborn reeled, his jaw broken. Black blood and jagged teeth spattered to the ground. Stonehewer looked down to his stained fist and grunted a third time.</p>

    <p>"I'll never get this stuff off," he said shaking the dark blood from his fist. With a half turn and powerful swing, Stonehewer swung his two handed sword again. The pale head of the first Trueborn fell into the dirt.</p>

    <p>Loral locked eyes with the second Trueborn who held his broken jaw with fingers covered in dark blood. Loral raised his hand and chanted to Tunare. A beam of white light bored into the vampire's chest and ripped out the tormented spirit. The dead corpse fell to the ground in a smoking heap.</p>

    <p>While they had vanquished the minions of Aviatis, the lord himself was beyond their estimations. Aviatis had climbed the ranks of the Trueborns for centuries and he did not do it by being either stupid or weak. They saw him standing alone in the center of his inner sanctum. He was even taller than the Trueborns they had faced before. Vamcill strode forward without a word, but they were not prepared for the reaction.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Loral felt his blood become thick. His heart slowed and he became instantly weak. His head throbbed in pain that blurred his vision on every pulse. He was faintly aware that the others were clutching at their chests and falling to their knees. Juror's spear clattered to the ground. Within merely the presence of the vampire lord, they had already lost.</p>

    <p>Loral heard the voice within his mind. The demon Xuzl spoke to him, told him to use the power within the shield on his arm. The horrible effect of the vampire's spell lifted and Loral found himself able to concentrate. He rose in front of the surprised vampire lord and with a quick swing, smashed the lord in the knee with his spiritual hammer, Daninulaer. A burst of white fire exploded over the vampire lord.</p>

    <p>Aviatis howled with rage and pain. His spell had broken. The others returned to their feet, quickly preparing their most powerful magics or most devastating attacks. Llyan fired arrow after arrow into the vampire. Many skipped harmlessly over the vampire lord's protective spells but some burrowed deep into the vampire's dead skin. A black tendril rolled off of Juror's palm and burrowed deep into the vampire's skin. The skin cracked and oozed black blood. Stonehewer strode in.</p>

    <p>The vampire's head snapped up and he punched out. A huge spiritual fist followed the move and blasted Stonehewer back against the rocky wall, crushing the wind out of him and knocking him unconscious. Aviatis whirled again and shards of ice ripped through the party. Clinching his jaw against the pain, Juror strode forward and rammed his spear deep into the lord's chest, piercing its black heart. The vampire and Juror locked eyes with each other. Juror ripped out the spear and the vampire fell dead to the ground.</p>

    <p>They had taken what trinkets they had found along the way back to the Wayfarers. Among the treasures of the vampire lord was a worn leather book. It had deep engravings in the thick cover, a cover of some skin Loral preferred not to think about, and on its back was a strange symbol or glyph. The language was old and it would take him much time to translate. He did not yet know that its message held the fate of Norrath within it.</p>

<p>The two elves glanced nervously about the crowded inn.  They did not much enjoy leaving their fair wood of the Faydark but their most recent employment demanded it.  Leaving the wood was bad enough but traveling through the Spires to the moon of Luclin was even more disturbing.</p>

<p>Talamiin, the older of the two and a seasoned warrior, spoke little as he sat hunched over his untouched ale.  He glanced at the adventurers entering the tavern, hoping to finish this job and be done with it.</p>

<p>"Have you met him before?" Silvian, the younger and far more eager elf, asked.  Talamiin shook his head.  "The guards of Felwithe speak of him."  Silvian continued, not noticing his companion's disinterest.  "He is a high priest with both Exarch and Archon titles of the church," Silvian continued. "He has been in the wilds since the discovery of Kunark.  He only returns to resupply himself and report to the church.  He is usually back out within twelve hours.  The loose lipped acolytes say that every promotion or title has been an attempt to bring him back.  Most priests his age have either returned to Felwithe or left the church.  But he won't come back and he won't leave."</p>

<p>"There are darker rumors as well."  Silvian lowered his voice. "Some say he consorts with demons and other dark powers.  He has traveled with ogres, trolls, even Tier'dal, at one time or another.  But he is still an agent of the Church, probably one of their best it is said."</p>

<p>"He is a murderer and a monster," the older elf spoke suddenly.  "Three years ago he killed a fellow cleric who interrupted one of his dark rituals.  The church says he was under a curse, but I think they still needed him rather than have him beheaded as he should have been.  It doesn't matter.  Here he is."</p>

<p>Silvian looked to the door and saw the cloaked figure enter.  He was tall and stood straight.  From under his hood he beheld the room through a pair of multi-colored spectacles.  Behind the curious spectacles, Silvian saw his cold blue eyes, eyes that seemed to stare beyond the walls of the room.  Silvian saw Loral's golden armor under his cloak, tarnished with weeks of travel.  Loral's eyes locked onto the two elves as he approached their table.  Silvian nodded to the priest and raised two fingers to his chest in a sign of blessing to the Mother of All, Tunare.  Loral casually returned the gesture.  Talamiin did nothing.</p>

<p>"I hear you have information for me."  Loral's voice sent shivers through Silvian.  He became aware that he was looking at the same high elf that had faced the rulers of Kunark, had battled against the devils of the outer planes,   had defeated the avatars of no less than twelve gods, four of them elder gods, and had faced and returned from the trials of the dragons of the Claws.</p>

<p>Talamiin kicked Silvian's chair and Silvian jumped.  Talamiin nodded to him to give their information.  Silvian was aware of Talamiin's dislike of the priest and he was aware that Loral was aware.  It seemed not to concern Loral, and Silvian began his tale.</p>

<p>"The Wayfarers have agents in every known city of Norrath.  They do not attempt to hide their presence but their popularity gives them access to a vast amount of information.  They have wizards and telepaths to share information among their agents and their camps."  Silvian paused for a moment.  "In three months the Wayfarers have become the most well informed, well connected, well financed, and with their mercenary force of adventurers, the most powerful organization of Norrath."</p>

<p>Loral looked down to the table for a moment, considering the words.  Then he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Where do they come from?"</p>

<p>"Their leader is a barbarian rogue named Mordin Rasp.  He and some adventurer friends of his formed the core of the Wayfarers.  They seem to have a limitless supply of magical artifacts which they reward to adventurers who work for them.  Their job seems honorable enough."  Silvian paused again, carefully considering his next words.  "Felwithe has supported their cause."</p>

<p>Loral's eyes shot up, locking hard onto Silvian's.  Silvian stiffened, not expecting such a quick and powerful reaction to his subtle implication.  He was not accusing Loral of subversion, but why would the priest hire them to look into a situation Felwithe had already dismissed.</p>

<p>"A group shows up out of nowhere.  In two months its agents infiltrate every city.  Their camps become small towns visited by the most powerful hunters of our world.  They are rich, powerful, and better connected than any other organization.  As soon as they appear, dens of some of the worst evil we have ever seen suddenly appear.  We do not know where they come from, we do not know what they want, and no one questions their appearance.  Felwithe may not be worried, but I am."</p>

<p>Loral reached under his cloak and dropped a bag onto the table.  Silvian sat with his mouth agape as Loral stood and left.  He looked to his companion and saw a smile on Talamiin's face.</p>

<p>"I may have been wrong about him after all."</p>

      <title>Chapter 44: Deepest Guk</title>
      <link>http://loralciriclight.com/001061.html</link>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">1061@http://loralciriclight.com/</guid>
      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Loral's head swam with the clues and rumors he had heard as he and his traveling companions walked through the upper caverns of the Froglok city of Guk.  He had heard of a curse of ancient evil and of the Grozmok stone but his pondering became circular as they walked.  Llyan the ranger was in front with Stonehewer the dwarven paladin, Juror the barbarian shaman, Loral the elven cleric, Kaylessa the elven enchantress, and Criket the Vah Shir beastlord in the rear.  Criket's warder, a five hundred pound striped cat, followed behind to make sure no beasts would take them by surprise.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/guk_undead_frog.jpg"><img src="./images/guk_undead_frog_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Undead Guktan" /></a>
    </div>

<p>Loral's thoughts of these rumors ceased when he came to the boarded passage that led to the deepest caverns of Guk.  It had been blocked by the Frogloks themselves after their scouting parties came screaming back out or did not come back at all. Stonehewer turned to the rest of the party, smiled, and kicked in the boarded up cavern entrance.  It was a typical dwarven conclusion to the topic of whether or not they should continue.</p>

<p>A foul air rose from the passage.  Strong winds howled through the tunnels.  The scraping and cracking of the deeper tunnels unnerved the party.  Finding strength within each other, the party continued into the complex network of caverns.</p>

<p>Stonehewer's cry of surprise and the twang of Llyan's bow were Loral's first warning of danger.  He saw the sagging grey-skinned creature crawling towards them with long fingered hands and webbed feet.  Its long infected tongue lolled out, dragging on the ground behind it.  Llyan's arrow had burst one of the milky dead eyes of the beast.  Yellow liquid dripped down its grey rotted cheek like a broken egg yoke.  The smell gagged Loral, making him stop in the middle of a prayer and ruining the spell he began to cast.  Loral saw bones tearing through the dead flesh of the beast.  There was no doubt that they faced the crawling hungry dead of Deepest Guk.</p>
    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/guk_undead_frog_2.jpg"><img src="./images/guk_undead_frog_2_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Undead Guktan" /></a>
    </div>
<p>Another of Llyan's arrows ripped into the beasts throat before Criket's warder roared in, tearing the beast apart with four inch claws.  The shock of the beast wore off Stonehewer. The paladin took three menacing steps forward and with a powerful overhand cut, severed the beast in two.</p>

<p>For twelve hours the party battled the undead minions of Guk, some rotting husks of recent adventurers, some ancient skeletal remains of Guk's ancestors.  Occationally a ghastly figure would form through the walls, spirits of the tormented dead of Guk, and rake at the party with ethereal claws.  Crossing into a large cavern of vine covered stone and green pools of bacteria, the party felt something else.</p>
    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/guk_eye.jpg"><img src="./images/guk_eye_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Oculous" /></a>
    </div>
<p>A hissing vibration filled the room.  The party felt it in their teeth and lower parts of their mind, the parts that will pull a hand out of a fire without thinking.  The hiss got louder and one of the strangest beast they had seen rounded one of the caverns corners.  It floated in the air about four feet off the ground.  It had a spherical bony shell surrounding a huge eye that stared angrily at them.  Tentacles, some ending in hideous mouths with needle-like teeth, others ending with sharp jagged blades, wiggled angrily at the party.  The hiss lowered its pitch and began to shake the party's nerves, paralyzing them.</p>

<p>The creature floated calmly over to the elven maiden, Kaylessa, preparing three of the vile mouths to tear into her soft skin.  With his remaining stamina, Llyan broke from the paralyzing grip of the eye's mental attack, drew his thin blade, and stabbed it in the most likely of targets, dead center in the huge eye.  The Oculus burst, spraying the party with fluid.  An inhuman primal scream filled their mind, reaching pitches beyond the capabilities of the mind to comprehend.  They fell to the ground in agony but as the thrashes of the eye began to slow, the pain went away.  Soon, it was dead and the party stood staring at horrifying creature with Llyan's blade protruding from its black pupal.</p>

<p>Oblivious to the battles above him the lich-priest, Bhotea, sat huddled over a web shrouded tome.  For the better part of a year he had researched this dark work.  Its words and runes twisted and reformed the more he read.  His body had begun to decay since reading the dark book, feeding its evil, but the priest no longer cared.  His longtime traveling companion, once a Guktan Paladin of Mithanial Marr, lay on a stone alter dissected and disemboweled.  He was a small sacrifice in the pursuit of power, thought Bhotea.</p>
    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/guk_eye_2.jpg"><img src="./images/guk_eye_2.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Ocluous" /></a>
    </div>
<p>A blazing flash of light in the corridor ahead of him tore the lich's attention from his beloved book.  He did not expect to see what he saw.  A dwarf, armored in shining blue plate armor, was stained with the black blood of the undead minions that shared this cavern with the lich.  His skin was ashen from the ethereal wounds of dozens of ghastly spectres but his eyes burned with a blazing life the lich no longer knew.</p>

<p>Stonehewer charged in holding his twin-bladed sword high.  The undead priest raised his hand and a blast of magical energy sent Stonehewer crashing to the ground.  Two arrows from Llyan's bow streaked in but a wave of the lich's hand turned them into dust before they reached him.  Juror blew a small wisp of dust from his hand.  The cloud grew into millions of tiny insects that roared around the lich.  The lich chanted three words and black tentacles burst from the floor around the barbarian, tearing into his legs and dragging him to the ground.  Criket and her warder both rushed in but were repelled by the same barrier that stopped Llyan's arrows.  The lich-priest grasped out with his clawed hand and made a fist in the air.  Criket came off the ground, crushed within a huge invisible hand.  Loral heard Criket's bones snapping as she floated in the air a few feet from the lich.</p>
    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/guk_lich_battle.jpg"><img src="./images/guk_lich_battle_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Lich Priest" /></a>
    </div>
<p>Kaylessa chanted her own spell.  A tiny black ball formed in her hand. It flew from the elven enchantress and smashed into the lich's invisible barrier with the sound of shattered glass.  Criket collapsed into a heap on the ground.  Stonehewer, understanding the significance of what happened, rose and approached the small undead wizard.  He cut powerfully and the lich's decomposing head flew into the air followed by a gyser of black sour blood.</p>

<p>Two days later the party sat outside the Wayfarer's Southern Ro camp.  Criket, now fully healed, sent her cat after Llyan who ran merrily in wolf form.  Juror and Kaylessa were speaking with one of the Wayfarers while Stonehewer tried with frustration to polish off the black acidic blood of the lich from his silver blade.  Loral, a small black-skinned journal in his hand, wrote of their adventure and his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I do not know what the Wayfarer's want, but I know that no evil such as the liches of Deepest Guk should remain."  Loral penned carefully.  "While their motivations are unknown the Wayfarer's instruction has aided the forces of good.  Perhaps I was wrong about them."</p>

      <title>Chapter 45: The Fireborn</title>
      <link>http://loralciriclight.com/001071.html</link>

<p>For three thousand years Fxandrakulzis the Fireborn ruled his lair in the caverns of Garulon within the Plane of Fire.  It was not a large lair, perhaps two thousand minions, but it afforded him the opportunity to delve into his passion, necromancy.  Five hundred years previous the Fireborn acquired a book outlining the dark art.  Following its instructions he tore apart dozens of his demonic minions and mortal slaves only to raise them as twisted undead beasts.  But the Fireborn was not satisfied.  He constantly sought out new necromatic magic to add to his dark powers.  Soon his wishes were answered.</p>

    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/mir_fireborn_in_fire.jpg"><img src="./images/mir_fireborn_in_fire_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Fireborn" /></a>
    </div>

<p>At the height of his power, the lich Miragul opened up rifts to both the Plane of Torment and the Plane of Fire.  He knew of the Fireborn and had heard of his vast knowledge of necromancy.  It took a great deal of the lich's power, but soon through a burning summoning circle deep in his icy labratory, Miragul pulled the Fireborn into the world of Norrath.</p>

<p>The Fireborn found that the lich Miragul was the only mortal he had ever liked, even perhaps admired if a greater demon can admire any mortal.  Together they built creations of true villainy and great horror, the Demonbone Skeletons.  These twisted remains of mortal bodies and demonic spirits had a thirst for blood beyond any creature of Norrath and an unnatural strength to match.</p>
    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/mir_fireborn.jpg"><img src="./images/mir_fireborn_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Fireborn in Miragul's Lair" /></a>
    </div>

<p>One day Miragul left the Fireborn's laboratory and never returned.  It mattered little to the red leathery-winged demon.  He drew fourth minions of his own world, huge muscled beasts like himself and continued his work.  Soon the icy caverns of Miragul's lair were filled with the Fireborn's demon-blooded undead.  Even planar beasts of Torment served his will, some huge rough-furred hulks and others hideous malformations of flesh, muscle, and fanged tentacles.  Soon after, the caverns of Miragul's lair had been uncovered.</p>

<p>It was then that the Fireborn met the priest.</p>

<p>He had just finished the construction of a huge and powerful demonbone skeleton, one built from the bones of a cloven hoofed Tormentor and a mammoth.  It was filled with a dark spirit that made even the Fireborn shivver.  He found the entrance of the adventuring party to be quite timely.</p>
    <div class="imageset1">
      <a href="./images/mir_fireborn_table.jpg"><img src="./images/mir_fireborn_table.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="The Labs of Miragul" /></a>
    </div>
<p>The Fireborn sent a telepathic command to his new beast and both he and a fellow red-winged demon watched the monstrosity rush out into the icy caverns.  A crash of thunder filled the hall.  A blast of heat rushed into the normally chilled halls.  For the Fireborn and his companion it was a taste of the fiery pits of home.  The clash of battle could be heard in the hall for perhaps a minute and then the party entered the Fireborn's lair.</p>

<p>The Fireborn took no chances.  He sent the other demon forward and sent a wave of lava over the party.  Each member of the six used some form of protection from molten rock.  Three hid behind shields, two behind cloaks, and one simply let it roll off of the protective shell of his armor.</p>

<p>The party was very well equipped.  He soon saw that their skills matched their equipment when his minion was cut down under a flurry of blades and spells.</p>
    <div class="imageset2">
      <a href="./images/mir_fireborn_battle.jpg"><img src="./images/mir_fireborn_battle_t.jpg" height="225" width="300" alt="Battle" /></a>
    </div>
<p>The Fireborn had not lived for four thousand years by acting rashly.  He knew when he was out-matched.  He was already chanting his darkspeech, preparing to return to his own world when the first arrow pierced his side.  His spell fizzled when a stunning blast from the outstretched hand of a dwarven bladeswinger knocked him back.  The sword wielders of the party where on him in an instant, tearing into his thick red skin and through his leathery wings.  He ripped at them with claws lined with fire, inflicting hideous gaping wounds but blue waves of light sealed them and the party continued their attack.</p>

<p>Then a voice filled his head, a telepathic voice in the darkspeech of the demon princes.  It was a voice he knew well.</p>

<p>"Hello, dear friend," Xuzl spoke.</p>

<p>"Master! Protect me from these hideous mortals!" the Fireborn pleaded in his own telepathic reply.</p>

<p>"You cannot win, especially not against one holding me," the voice spoke calmly.</p>

<p>The Fireborn saw it.  A circular shield blazing with fire held by the golden-armored priest.  A thousand questions entered his mind but all of them were silenced when a beam of searing red energy burned a perfect hole through the center of his head like a third eye.  The last thing he saw was the shield blazing with fire, the fire of his master.  He awoke on his island of rock in the center of a thousand mile lake of lava in the Plane of Fire.  It would be five hundred years before he could return to Norrath again.  Streams of lava rolled down his red cheeks.  He had been betrayed.</p>
