<h1>The Tales of Loral</h1>


  <h2 class="entrytitle">About Loral Ciriclight</h2>
  
 

      <p>Loral was the son of a jewel dealer, a widower, in the fine city of Felwithe. His father was a good man, but always had an eye out for profit. One day, a strange traveler came in and sold him a magical hammer said to send demons back into hell with one blow. The hammer was a mighty piece and very valuable, but Loral's father had no intention of selling it. One night, a figure came to their door. He was taller than a man, with pale blue skin. When Loral's father approached him, the figure pulled back his hood and introduced himself as the Maestro of Rancor, sent to retrieve the feared weapon for his lord, Innoruuk. Loral's father attacked with the mighty weapon but when he slammed the magic hammer into the demon, the Maestro laughed, embraced Loral's father and they both disappeared into the plane of Hate. Loral never saw his father again.</p>

      <p>Now an orphan, Loral was taken in by the local Church of Tunare where he began his life as a priest. He was happy with his duties, but always dreamed of the riches and adventure life had to offer. One day he met a Cleric of Quellious from the far away land of Erudin named Ciric Azilebane along with his long time companion, the wizard Azile Ciricbane. They traded tales of their adventures with the young Loral, telling him of the beauty of the Karanas, the awesome magicks of Erudin and the horrors of Unrest. Loral was enthralled hearing their stories. A month passed, Azile had left for the lands of Raithe, but Ciric had decided it was time to hang up his adventuring boots and settle down. He took Loral under his wing and cultivated his dreams of traveling the lands of Norrath. Time came for Loral to begin his adventures, and on the day of his departure to the dwarven city of Kaladim, Ciric handed him a pack containing all of his old adventuring equipment. Loral doned the armor and wielded Ciric's mighty Shining Star of Light as he left the city to spread the word of Tunare and live the life of an adventurer.</p>

      <p>The horrors of seeing his father taken away from this world gave Loral a hatred of all unnatural beasts especially the vile undead that infested the lands. He hunted many moons in the lands of Butcherblock, ridding it of the dwarven skeletons and listening to the tales of the mighty travelers that passed through. It was during this time that he met the group Healers United, a guild who traveled the lands to bring back life and peace in a world of hatred and fear. He knew immediately he had found his place among the members of the guild and did his best to spread the word of Tunare in their name.</p>

      <p>Being raised by a jewel dealer gave Loral a keen eye for the marketplace. He traded often at the bazaars and was always quick and keen in the art of the haggle. While his true love and purpose is to spread the will of Tunare, he always enjoys browsing the wares of the Oasis bazaar.</p>

      <p>Still the memories of his father being snatched by the demons of hate flooded his mind, keeping him isolated from society. He traveled into the desert of Ro, hoping to chase away these demons that haunted his mind with the ancient techniques taught to him by Ciric and by reading a tome of knowledge known as the Testament of Vanear, a book given to him by Azile, the arch wizard, his traveling protector in the harsh world. While he learned much and became even more powerful as an instrument of Tunare, he still tasted the poison of hate that Innoruuk had left in his life.</p>

<p>Throughout his travels Loral has acquired a powerful collection of magical items and artifacts.  For his time in the Halls of Testing, the Claws of Veeshan awarded him with Akkirus's Armor of the Risen, a suit of armor enchanted with the spiritual essence of the dragon-priest Akkirus.  His boots are a soft leather colored red from the ooze of a red slime in the depths of the Temple of Cazic Thule.  A ring on his right hand acts as a key to the inner sanctum of Emperor Ssraeshza.  Loral wears an eyepatch of Torbin modified into a pair of spectacles, one lense shaded blue and the other green giving him ultravision and allowing him to see through invisibility.  Around his head is a coil of twisted platnum wire that focuses his thoughts. His primary weapon is the hammer, Daninulaer, one of the spiritual Hammers of Damnation.  Loral also carries one of the Water Sprinklers of Nem Ankh, an artifact of the Triumverate that returns life to any fallen ally.  Loral carries many items from the outer planes that allow him to better focus and channel Tunare's power.</p>

<p>Two of Loral's other magical items include a bridal of summoning for his Planar horse, Illuminia, and a strange gnomish box that locates the bodies of his comrades to be resurrected later.  The grotesque box makes sniffing noises as it points Loral towards his fallen friends.</p>

<p>His most interesting and dangerous item is a Circular Shield of the Blaze possessed or partially possessed by the demon prince Xuzl, a servant of Solusek Ro.  The demon-possessed shield protects Loral from almost all fire and channels Loral's energy into a more chaotic and destructive blast.  Loral and the trapped demon are often in mental conflict with neither ever gaining the upper hand.  While other powers may be embedded in the shield, they have yet to show themselves fully.</p>

      <p>The following are summaries of the tales of Loral Ciriclight. More information can be gained by reading the full stories first.</p>

      <h2>The Fist of Innoruuk</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>Under the direction of the Church of Tunare and with the help of his new friends, Healers United, Loral traveled to the lands of Kunark in search of the lady Fironia Vie. There he discovered the plots between the great Ring of Scale, the lich-king Venril Sather and the ancient dragon constructs, the Sarnak. With the help of many of Norrath's adventurers, Loral assisted in the slaying of the great Lord Nagafin and the undead poison dragon, Trakanon, as well as an assault on the Plane of Fear, home of the minions of the demon-god Cazic Thule.</p>

      <p>During his assaults of the Sarnak Fortress of Ill Omen, Loral learned of a plot against his mentor, Ciric Azilebane. He quickly helped defeat the plotted assassination by killing the Dark Elf General who planned it. During this battle, Loral discovered a dark mace of great power, an ancient artifact of Bloody Kithcor.</p>

      <p>Filled with a newfound bloodlust, Loral waged an assault against four powerful figures of the plot against Fironia Vie. Korasal Klyseer, Prince Selrahc Di'Zok, the vampire Xalgoz and Venril Sather himself were killed during the attacks. Still, Loral's vengence was not satisfied with their deaths.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>It was discovered by his friends in Healers United, that the dark mace Loral carried was a vehicle of influence for the dark elf god, Innoruuk. With it, he convinced Loral to open a gateway to the Plane of Hate. Convinced he would slay the Avatar of Innoruuk in Antonica's Arena, Loral used ancient magiks discovered in the libraries of Kaesora and Chardok to open the gateway. Innoruuk, knowing he would be victorious in such a battle, planned to invade all of Norrath.</p>

      <p>The Healers confronted Loral and told him of Innoruuks plot. Enraged, Loral killed the young cleric Idoru and forced the Healers into combat. Minions of Innoruuk battled the Healers but they were victorious and the dark mace was destroyed. Loral was resurrected by the leader of Healers United, Dahlea, and released from the influence of the dark god.</p>

      <p>Haunted by his actions and seeking freedom from the torments of the death of his father, Loral confronted Innoruuk within the Plane of Hate. A great assault was waged against the dark lord and after a bloody battle, the demon god was slain.</p>

      <h2>War of Ice</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>Faced with the horrors of his actions and still shaking free the dark influence from his spirit, Loral sought solitude within the icy lands of Velious. Here he befriended the Coldain Dwarves and assisted in their battles against the Ice Giants.</p>

      <p>Loral joined in many assaults against the ice giants including some within their city of Kael Drakkal. He soon learned that the giants wished to lay siege to the Plane of Growth, home to Loral's goddess, Tunare. The defeat of the Avatar of Tunare and the poisoning of the lands of Lesser Faydark kept the Elven empire of Felwithe from assisting in the war of Ice. Loral was forced to seek allies with another much more mysterious group, the Claws of Veeshan.</p>

      <p>While Azile researched ancient powers of the dragon Hsagra, Loral traveled through the icy lands of the Western Wastes. Here he discovered the great temple of Veeshan, an ancient monument to the crystaline dragon built long before Loral's race ever walked Norrath. Loral was tested by the great dragonkin of the Claws in their Halls of Testing along with many other adventurers who sought the wisdom and strength of the dragons. Loral was given much more than the artifacts rewarded to him after succeeding in the tests, he was given a larger understanding of the ways in which Norrath lives.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Soon, Loral joined with his friend Azile, now one of the most powerful sorceresses in Norrath, and waged a final assault against the city of Kael. Here, assisting the powerful hunter guild, Lotus Cult, Loral witnessed the defeat of both the guardian, Derakor the Vindicator, and the lord of Kael, King Tormax.</p>

      <p>Returning home, Loral was rewarded with the title High Priest of Tunare for his actions in protection of the Mother of All. A new mission was given to Loral. To travel through the recently awakened portals to the moon of Luclin and discover what he could of the new lands. Half excited to be visiting such mysterious lands and half understanding the Church's memory of his influence under Innoruuk, Loral accepted and along with his friends, traveled to the moon of Luclin.</p>

      <h2>Darkness and Light</h2>
      
        
      
      <p>Accepting the mission of the exploration of the new strange lands, Loral traveled along with many seasoned adventurers to the lands of Luclin. He spent many days in the town of Shadowhaven and purchased a magical bridal that summoned a great magical horse named Illumina. He traveled through the underground passages, wrought with dangerous beasts never seen on Norrath to discover a lush magical land outside the cat city of Shar Val. Little did he know that back on Norrath his barbarian servant and tradesman, Bonescar, had been assassinated.</p>

      <p>Loral explored much of the lands of Luclin, joining up with an adventuring party from Healers United. Together they traveled to the canyons of Mons Letalis where they discovered the ruins of once-mighty teleportation spires. Entering a cave at the base of the mountain supporting the great spires they confronted and defeated the spire spirits, the ghosts of long-dead wizards or minions from the plane of shadows, and their ruler, the Spire Lord.</p>

      <p>Using a powerful artifact known as the Faithstone of Nature, Loral returned to his hometown of Felwithe and received further instructions from the High Priest of Felwithe, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf. Loral was to return to Luclin and track down a lost Kaoa'dal paladin who had been exploring the ruined temple of the Shissar.</p>

      <p>Loral had written a book on Iksar history, a subject he found fascinating regardless of their worship of the faceless god, Cazic Thule. He found their society to be one of once great nobility and impossible hardships. He knew that all the great strength of the three great Iksar empires was due to the horrible conditions of life as slaves to the Shissar. To hear of the discovery of Shissar ruins on Luclin was to hear of a great darkness indeed.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Meeting up with fellow adventurers from the Healers, Loral traveled to the Grey. There he and his friends battled many of the undead and magical creations that scourged the wasteland surrounding the powerful blue temple. In a great battle, they defeated a great clay golem that protected the temple from outside eyes. A few days later, Loral's party disbanded and he went alone into the black mouth of the evil Temple.</p>

      <p>As he entered the Temple of Ssraeshza, Loral quickly found himself whisked away by a hunting party of Lotus Cult, the guild of his old friend, the sorceress Azile Ciricbane. The powerful hunters took him down into the mines below the temple where Loral discovered more of the horrors of the Shissar empire and one very dangerous fact. The Shissar were attempting to escape the confines of their temple and once again rule over the known worlds. Once again, Loral used the Faithstone to return home, but this time it didn't work.</p>

      <p>The teleportation of the Faithstone was routed by the ancient magics of the serpent rulers and Loral was taken by the Shissar interrogators. For unknown hours the interrogators, led by a great glyphed serpent, sent false memories into Loral's mind. These memories built an entire reality for Loral, all with the intent of distilling his mind and receiving what they could. For what seemed to be a century of life, Loral believed every memory they implanted. Soon, however, a great burning in his had showed him of the false-life and he broke free from the shackles the Shissar held against him. At this same time the hunters of Lotus Cult attacked and killed Loral's captors and he was able to escape to the city of Felwithe via the Faithstone.</p>

      <p>Loral returned soon enough with the hunters of Lotus Cult and aided them in their battle against the emperor of the Shissar, the Godslayer, Ssraeshza. In a massive battle combining all known races and religions of Norrath, the hunters defeated the ancient Shissar king and saved Norrath from falling once again into his clutches.</p>

      <p>Loral returned to Shadowhaven and spent much of his time in retrospect over all that he had learned. Many great changes he had seen in 100 years of service as an adventurer of Tunare. The fading of the lines between the races being the greatest of them all. No longer did the races kill each other on site, now accepting their differences and even banding together for the greater good of all their kingdoms.</p>

      <p>They would need it, for soon opened the doorway to the outer planes and a danger they couldn't begin to expect.</p>

      <h2>The Outer Planes</h2>

<p>Unsure of his place within the Church, the Council of Felwithe sends Loral to investigate the newly discovered gateways to the outer planes.  Still tormented by his false memories during his captivity by the Shissar, Loral dives into the outer planes with vigor and assists in many huge battles against younger and older gods alike.  His adventures in these outer worlds change Loral, filling him with new power and allowing him to discover many lost and powerful magical artifacts.</p>

<p> One of these artifacts, a shield found in the Tower of Solusek Ro within the Plane of Fire, contains at least a piece of the arch-demon Xuzl, a servant of Solusek Ro.  The demon was slain by the raiding party, Lotus Cult, and somehow a piece of the demon's soul was trapped within the shield.  Xuzl spoke to Loral in dreams and visions as well as direct conversation, hoping to bargain or force his release upon the world of Norrath where he would surely prosper among the corpses of mortals.</p>

<p>Years later, Loral would trick the demon.  He would release the demon within a cavern deep underneith Felwithe, and with the aid of magical and physical bonds, would trap the demon forever.</p>

<p>Today, however, the demon still speaks to Loral, trading power for control.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 1: Ro</h2>
  
<p>The sun felt as heavy as the mace Loral carried through the desert of Ro. The normal gleam of his dwarven chainmail was dull from the dust and grime that constantly beat on him, seeming to come from every direction at once. Still his eyes narrowed, ignoring the bite of the hot wind, while he tracked his prey. He lifted two fingers and said a small three word prayer to Tunare. Sparks flew from his forehead, turning his attention west, guiding him again to the elusive creature he hunted. He climbed the dune in front of him and once reaching the peak he saw his prey.</p>

      <p>"There is a form of evil in this land that should have never been" he remembered his mentor, Ciric, stating one day as they listened to the peaceful rush of water at the edge of the river in the elven city of Felwithe. Loral was just a wild teenager back then, hardly sixteen seasons old but ready to take on all the evil that Norrath had to offer. He remembered the lifeless look in Ciric's eyes more than the words as he spoke as he described the horrible plague of undead that seemed to reach out of the darkness of Hate and into the once peaceful land. "It is our job as the vehicle of our God to rid the lands of this plague," the tall Erudite cleric continued as if reading Loral's thoughts. Loral always got excited imagining himself citing a word of his lord, Tunare, and watching the trapped spirit leave the bones it was imprisoned in. The next statement tore these glamorous thoughts from his mind and made his heart sink until it almost brought him to tears. "It is this evil that took your father, Loral. This isn't a game."</p>

      <p>Though the words happened almost a year ago, they still rang as he stared down the Drybone. The Drybone was physically not much different than the dwarven skeletons he hunted in Butcherblock during his 8th season as a cleric of Tunare. It possessed the same physical vehicle, an ancient decaying skeleton, and had the same lumbering walk as if pulled by a puppeteer. The Drybone was much different though, the spirit inside had gained just enough control to understand it's current status and went insane from it. Sometimes the spirit was a warrior that had made a pact to live forever, only to realize what forever really was, but other times, as in this case, a mage or wizard had made the attempt for immortality themselves with disastrous results. These were the most dangerous types as only lunatic undead wizards would be.</p>

      <p>Loral opened his pack to see the black sockets of his dark totem staring back at him with that evil grin. He pulled the skull out and when his hands touched it, sparks of life appeared in the sockets. This magical skull, a gift from a member of his guild, the Healers United, gave him a surge of energy he could channel into his God's gifts of magic. It always left a sour taste in his mouth when he looked at the ironic icon that gave him this energy while laughing at him in his mind at the same time. Though, as Ciric would say, sometimes in order to defeat your enemy you had to use his power against him. This didn't make Loral feel better about using dark magiks of the Skull of Jhen'ta.</p>

      <p>Loral wanted the battle over quick, so he stood and cast his first spell. The tendrals of roots hundreds of feet under the desert floor thrusted upwards and wrapped around the cracked bones of the Drybone's legs. The drybone struggled against the roots as Loral's eyes went white and the powers of Tunare began to tear the screaming spirit from the bones. The drybone finally managed to turn as the second expulsion began. Loral held the skull of Jen'ta high and cast a third blast. The drybone began its own incantation, finally realizing that it didn't need to move in order to retaliate. Fire burst fourth from it's hands and caused Loral's blood to raise sharply in temperature. Loral grit his teeth from the pain and continued to expulse the undead beast. The Drybone was weakened to the point of destruction but let out a final blast of fire dropping Loral to his knees. Loral dropped the Skull and let out his final expulse, breaking the bones apart and releasing a white light of the trapped spirit that dissipated into the air around him.</p>

      <p>Loral could hardly move but felt the rush of bringing the world one step closer to the land he had known as a boy. His excitement faded as he saw once again the eyes of the magical skull staring back at him, mocking his meager attempt to right what is wrong and reminding him how far he has to go.</p>
    
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 2: Vie</h2>
  

        
      

      <p>A black spike, the size of a spearhead sliced through Loral's dwarven chain and bit into the skin of his shoulder with a single powerful blow. Never had Loral been so viscously hit. The blow knocked him down and slid him against the ground. Apparently, this creature wasn't to happy about him restoring the health of Kormac, the steadfast fighter and a recent friend of Loral, during their battle. A set of black bug like eyes stared at Loral from a beautiful female Tier'Dal face on top of a spiders enlarged body.</p>

      <p>Loral regained his composure and whispered a prayer to Tunare. The wound healed up to just a scratch and he attempted to stand. Before his footing had settled though he fell back down again. There was more to that spike than the initial sting it seemed.</p>

      <p>Loral's vision blurred and the last thing he heard was the sound of the Drachnid's inhuman voice voice chanting dark words as her hands began to glow red. Before the blast hit, Loral fell unconsious from the poison.</p>

      <p>"Poison. That is what Fulgor of the Tusk said when he saw the wood Elven city of Kelethin. It is often the same among the other races and religions. If it does not follow the same path as you, their society is poison." Loral sat in the small and quiet tavern in Felwithe with Ciric Azilebane, his friend and mentor. Loral had just returned from Antonica after his adventures in Ro and was catching up with his old teacher. Loral had described a strange lizard creature, armed and dressed as a fighter, he had seen in the tunnel bazaar a few weeks past. Soon after, Loral learned of the lands of Kunark and the lizard-folk who resided there, the mighty but fallen empire of the Iksars. Loral had told Ciric of his decision to travel to these lands and remove this dangerous menace. Ciric just smiled at this statement and told Loral of the story of Fulgor, the barbarian leader who had told his people of the strange and dangerous wood elves.</p>

      <p>"All creatures of Norrath have a social system, Loral. All believe their society and their deities are the right one. Any threat to that social system is looked upon as dangerous to their way of life. Veeshan has worked a mighty puzzle with all of us and we each have our part to play. While you have the word of Tunare to spread, do not forget that those who oppose it feel just as strongly towards their way of life. Neither is right or wrong."</p>

      
        

      

      <p>Like all statements coming from Ciric's mouth, this one had Loral thinking all the way from his beloved city of Felwithe to the dark and dangerous lands of Kunark. His excitement seemed to have no bounds as he boarded the mighty Elven vessel that traveled faster than he thought possible to the wonderful outpost in Fironia Vie. The giant statue of Tunare made his heart soar and he stepped off the pier with a new sense of purpose. He was not going to destroy the Iksar menace. He was going to attempt to understand it, learn its culture and its motivation. After all, had Ciric not given him the understanding to treat all of Norrath's creatures individually he never would have sworn himself to Dalhea, the leader of the guild of healers. An alliance he has never questioned.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral traveled outside the gates with a party of adventurers like himself and saw the giant millennia old Iksar statue shaking it's fist at the sky as if in defiance of the Gods for bringing their society to it's lowly state. It wasn't one of the fallen Iksars that met him underneath the statue near the mouth of a river that fed into the bay, but the black eyed Drachnid. At first he thought a beautiful naked Tier Dal was coming out of the water to greet them, a site that had him gasping for air all on it's own, but the site of the eight giant legs digging into the earth on both sides of the stream, almost 5 meters apart from each other stunned him even more. The mouth of the cursed creature of Innoruuk opened, revealing the inhumanly sharp teeth. Then the leg tip came in at him.</p>

      <p>"No time for dreaming friend" the lovely barbarian shaman, Desjadins, said as her desease curing potion destroyed the vile ichor that entered his blood. "This battle still needs you".</p>

      <p>Loral stood, feeling as if he had slept for a week to discover his party continuing to battle the vile creature. Aleustria, a powerful and deadly ranger, sliced and slashed the beast along with Kormac's mighty blows until the demon-spawn lay in a pile of cracked shell and blood.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The party cheered in victory over the corpse of the vile creature, but an inhuman scream of horror and anger broke their victory cry down as fast as it had started. Above on a hill, a male Drachnid stared at it's fallen mate. His hands raised and clouds of green gas began to seep out of the ground.</p>

      <p>Even these dark creatures had a social system it seemed, and their party had just cut it down without a thought. Now they would have to pay for it.</p>
    
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 3: Nagafen</h2>
  
      <p>Loral was hunting the vile Spectral minions of Trakanon's Teeth when he got the word.</p>
      

      <p>"You can go." was all that was said, but those three words changed Loral's life. He would have the ability to represent the Healers United at their first raid on Lord Nagafen, the great red wyrm of Norrath. Since he was a wee lad he had dreamed of facing the dragon, as did every child who ever picked up a wooden sword, but very few ever got the opportunity. Loral, it seemed, would be one of these few.</p>

      <p>He immediately let his group know what was happening and they all rejoiced for him. Being only of the 43rd circle of Tunare meant he was one of the youngest members going. He first was going to have to get to the 44th circle as fast as he can, then begin to collect as much fire protection equipment as he would be able to get.</p>

      <p>Desjardins the long time friend and hunting partner of Loral helped him reach the 44th circle and receive his newest line of spells in a short period of time. Then Azile, the arch-wizard only smiled and shook her head when hearing about the event, then handed Loral a purse of two thousand platinum and sent him on his way to the ever running bazaar of Ro.</p>

       

      <p>Within a matter of hours, Loral was suited up with new armor and stood among some of the roughest and toughest mercenaries in all of Norrath. They had come from all over Norrath, it seemed, to hunt Lord Nagafen. Some came for the promise of riches, some for the thrill of the hunt. Some had experience hunting the great beast before, but all of them were nervous, this they all shared.</p>

      <p>The initial raiding parties were put together and began to march on Nagafen's lair. The three Giant Slayers, mighty warriors who were trained and bred to destroy the nasty Fire Giants that stood in the way of the great beast, headed in first. The other teams went in second. I was picked as the leader of one of these teams.</p>

      <p>The teams began pouring into the entrance to the dragon's lair, slaying the greater Kobolds and heading to the Stone Spider room, a large room about half way to Nagafen's lair. Here we listened to the clashing of steel and the stomping of boots as the giant slayers stormed the front doors of the Fire Giant Citadel. We waited with nervous anticipation, each one of us wondering whether we would be able to slay the beast.</p>

      <p>Then we were called up, the door guards were killed and we could begin to make our way forward. As we moved through the Giants lair, eventually into the throne room of their king, the giant slayers would pull in one or two of the beasts and the groups of soldiers would drop it to the ground. As soon as battle would be engaged, Loral would watch the health of the three warriors, the mage and the bard in his group, but aside from some minor singes, they were never hurt.</p>

       

      <p>Finally, the last giant, a mage named Rokyl, was slain and Wail gave the orders to begin preparing for battle. The groups began to disband, and everyone dropped their preparation spells for the final set to be cast on them. First four weaker protection spells were cast one each member, and then sets of much more powerful protection spells were cast over every member of the group. Once completed, the member would lie down and a magical sleep was laid over them. Once all were ready, all would be awakened simultaneously and the battle would rage.</p>

      <p>An induced dream entered the minds of every soldier in the raid. The orders were implanted into the very sub concous of every man and woman in there. The attack groups were laid out, the plans set fourth. Nagafen would be attacked in two waves. The warrior heavy battle group would be sent in a piece at a time, never giving Nagafen a chance to prepare for the next group. Wizards would blast, druids would call upon the natural surroundings and warriors would hack at the beast until it lies dead.</p>

      <p>Loral was to stay back outside the entrance and heal as it was required of him. He had only one spell needed, a complete heal spell that removed all damage from his party members. He was to cast this on each member as needed until he was able to cast it no more.</p>

      <p>Then the battle horn was called. All the warriors at once were brought back from their sleep. The scared faces now looked like those of a machine, ready to perform their simple operation until they were able to perform it no more. The final groups were put together and the waves were set up.</p>

      <p>With a final silent moment, the raiding party stood outside the stone head that led into the lair of the ancient dragon. Then the order was given.</p>

      <p>"Wave one, charge!"</p>

      <p>With a chorus of shouts, the first team rushed in. Loral and his warriors stood ready for their order. Then it came.</p>

      <p>"Wave two, charge!"</p>
       

      <p>Loral's fighters rushed up the stairs, with Loral in tow, past the corner and into the mouth of the tunnel. Loral got a sight of the dragon, one of the most deadly creatures in all of Norrath, and began preparing his spells. A blast wave like none he had ever seen hit the group, sending Tynulaver to his knees and the others back on their heels. Then a wave of fear hit them. Loral stood aside as a stream of the battlers, unable to control their own movements, ran past him and into the hall behind. Loral began casting his heal on the mortally wounded Tynulaver but it was too late for him, the dragon had him. Loral instead cast on Lindadar, the next warrior in his path. This spell sank in and he was completely healed and ready for another battle. Another prayer left his lips and Lindadar was healed, but soon fell dead a few seconds later.</p>

      <p>Then the terror of the mighty dragon set in. Watching two of his members fall in a matter of seconds, plus a look at the mighty creature was too much for Loral and he felt himself running back into the throne room. Behind him another blast sent people sprawling out into the hall. Loral regained himself and rushed back in to help his comrades, but his mana was spent and he could do nothing but watch as another of his comrades fell. Then a final blast tore the life from Loral's body and dropped him to the floor unconscious.</p>

      <p>Loral awoke in the sleep chamber, only a short ways away from the battle. Two of his party still battled on, and he could still help them. He sat and memorized his complete heal prayer from his book and rushed back into the fray. This time, no fear sunk in and no blast pushed him back out. The mighty dragon was beginning to soften. Loral cast heal after heal until his mana had been depleted. He could do nothing now but watch. Again the piles of bodies forced him into a run back to the safety of the outside hall, but he forced himself back in again.</p>
       

      <p>Then with a mighty roar, Nagafen fell.</p>

      <p>A hush fell over those remaining. The dragon's enormous body laid out in front of them was almost surreal. Only one of Loral's fighters remained alive. The other four had fallen during the fight. Loral managed to scramble over the body and see the true carnage of the fight. Corpses littered the stairway of the great beast's lair, blood rushed in rivers into the steaming lava on both sides. A group of the survivors was forming inside the main hall of Nagafen's lair. Loral made his way into the room and collapsed. He attempted to search for his friends, Desjardins, who had made it. Nitzerebb, a fellow healer, who had also joined in the hunt was sitting there. They smiled at each other and let their exhaustion take over.</p>
       

      <p>The high level clerics worked to help restore life to the fallen bodies. Soon all the original warriors sat in the hall and cheered. Tails of the battle were being sung and written by the bards. Loot was handed out to those lucky enough to receive it. The rest simply enjoyed the moment of serenity in this mouth of darkness. Then groups started to teleport away, led by the druids and wizards of the group. There was another danger of this place. It was very easy in such a crowd to become left behind, unable to escape the clutches of even the now dead wyrm. Luckily an kind soul helped Loral and the remaining members leave the dangerous place and they soon found themselves on the rocks of a druid circle a few kilometers away.</p>

      <p>The battle was a success. Nagafen had fallen.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 4: The Ring of Scale</h2>
  
<p>Loral was returning from his adventures in the desert of Ro when he heard the horrible news about the kidnapping of the young maiden, Fironia Vie. While the clerics of the church of Tunare did not answer directly to King Thex of Felwithe, Loral took a personal interest in the return of the Elven princess. Rumor had it that she was personally blessed by Tunare, and this fact alone gave Loral the drive to help in her rescue.</p>

      <p>After meeting with his mentor, Ciric, in Felwithe he made the decision to explore Kunark and attempt to find the young maiden. He also wished to learn more of the Iksar people. He had heard of King Thex's wrath towards the Iksar prisoner, but he personally felt that the king acted rash and that you could not denounce an entire race for the actions of one group.</p>

      <p>Ciric left the city of Felwithe along with Loral and they split up at the docks of Butcherblock. Ciric was returning to the church of light in Quenos to find more information on these new lands while Loral was going to visit the lands himself.</p>
       

      <p>After an explosive introduction to Kunark, Loral had many adventures in the land. He spent some time fighting for the newly formed city of Vie (named from the young missing maiden) against the scourge of the nearby giants of the Kromdek. During these times he ran into the occasional Sarnak, a dragon-like creature that stood on two legs and fought like a man. He tracked down a particular faction of these creatures, known as the Kly, to a crypt in the lands of Warslick Woods. Along with his adventuring group he managed to battle his way down through the caverns of this dungeon and meet up with the Kly Imprecator, an ancient Sarnack that had acted as the servant to Dalnir a millennia ago. After a bloody battle with the Kly, Loral discovered a note discussing the young Koada'dal maiden, Feronia Vie, and was signed by the Circle of Scale.</p>
       

      <p>Loral met back up with Ciric in Quenos, after traveling back to the lands of Antonica and learned that the Circle of Scale was an ancient alliance of the greater dragons of Norrath. Some of these great beasts stormed in the open lands of Kunark, but most were secluded in their lairs deep within the earth including a legendary land known as Veeshan's Peaks, where it was rumored the inner lords of the Circle of Scale resided.</p>

      <p>With the help of the leader of Healers United, Dahlea, Loral found himself in a small army that was going to slay the great red dragon, Nagafin. After the epic battle against Lord Nagafen, Loral found little to help discover the location of Feronia, except to hear of another land, undiscovered in thousands of years known as Velious. A land still ruled by the great dragons and giants that made their homes there in the beginning of time.</p>
       

      <p>Shortly thereafter, Loral was asked to join a raiding party who would be going after Lady Vox, Nagafen's mate. While the war party Loral joined had no problem battling the goblins who had moved into the fortress of Permafrost a millennia ago, and even defeated the Ice Giants who protected Vox, treachery was afoot.</p>

      <p>The priest of Nagafin, a fire giant emissary of the red dragon had warned Lady Vox of the impending attack and she was prepared. She froze half the soldiers with her icy breath upon entering the great cavern and those that remained standing ran in sheer terror from the beast. Her giant guards who had stood in wait pounced on the fleeing warriors and crushed them with boulder, feet and fists. Loral managed to escape along with a few others from the ambush and later helped to heal the wounded who made it out. Wizards and druids helped those trapped in the icy caverns to escape from the clutches of the giants. Vox laughed her horrible icy laugh as the party scrambled away.</p>

      <p>Loral continued his exploration of Kunark, searching for more information on the Circle of Scale, and the mysterious lich-king of Kunark, Venril Sather who's name is whispered by the dying Lycanthrope's outside of Karnor's Castle, where Loral currently hunts.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 5: The War of Fear</h2>
  
<p>While successfully holding back the minions of Unrest from invading all of the Faydark, the Healers United took many casualties. Seeing his friends fall to the minions of Cazic Thule sent Loral into a rage. He traveled back to his home of Felwithe, but the demons followed him, if only in his mind.</p>

      <p>Then opportunity presented itself to strike back. A long time friend of Loral from his hunts in the lands of Kunark, Dinirose the Enchanter, sent word that they were amassing a force from the highest guilds in the land to counterattack Cazic Thule in his homeworld, the Plane of Fear.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral traveled to the dark swamps of the Feerott, where the rumored portal to Fear existed. After tracking a specter's roar through a wall in the mountain, Loral found the cave. The catacombs in the mountain almost did Loral in, as the specters scythe slashed at him while he ran aimlessly into the cave. Then around a corner like many hundreds before it, Loral faced the portal.</p>

      <p>Dinirose and a black robed necromancer stood by the portal. Icebone skeletons surrounded the portal but left the party alone, as if inviting them to step inside the portal and greet Cazic Thule himself.</p>

      <p>Loral's fear almost overtook him, but the images of his friends being cut down by Thule's minions started his heart afire again. He stepped up on the stairwell that lead to the portal and after whispering a last prayer to Tunare, he stepped inside.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The blood red sky burned Loral's eyes as he stepped out of the fiery portal. The land stretched in front of him, covered with horribly twisted trees and scorched earth. His small party had already traveled ahead of him, so he ran to catch up, but the vile denizens of this cursed place caught up with him first. The stinging cold of some white spider-like creature hit him like a crashing wave. Along with it came two red demons, who bit and clawed at him. Loral fell to his knees before their savagery. He was unprepared for such creatures and fell quickly. Blackness surrounded him.</p>

      <p>It was not the beautiful face of Tunare that his eyes laid upon when he awoke, but that of Dinirose. A dwarven cleric had returned his soul to his body and he stood up once again, weakened and disoriented. The red sky was still above him, but now he felt a wetness falling on him from it. It seemed too warm and thick to simply be rain and he was horrified when he saw the blood streaming down his armor.</p>

      <p>Apparently his companions had found the raiding party and had dragged his corpse along with them. The dwarven cleric called upon his own gods to restore Loral, and they began preparing for the small war against Cazic Thule's minions.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Vile creatures so unnatural they never would walk the earth of the prime material plane slashed and blasted at the war party. Minions of Thule that Loral had only heard about from Ciric, his mentor, or had seen in ancient tomes written back in the days the Ring of Scale ruled the Norrath. Some demons as small as goblins or fire beetles fought with the fury of giants or wurms. Mutated apes and towering ghouls all clawed against the earth in search of the blood of mortals. The giant squid headed Amygdalons, the elite guard of Cazic Thule offered the most resistance, blasting with poison clouds and cutting with viscous claws. They soon fell to the party, though, with limited casualties.</p>

      <p>For days, the party traveled across the dark vile lands, slaying demons and hell-spawn with no mercy. Many priests from many gods traveled with them, and Loral had found himself spending more time blasting down the demon-kin than he did healing. Only occasionally would one of the vile creatures slay one of the warparty, but a quick prayer to Tunare would restore them to this world.</p>

      <p>The holy war lasted two weeks, but finally it was apparent that they could not stay in this land forever and Cazic Thule himself was not to be found. Loral bade his friends goodbye and gated himself back to the lands of Kunark. While the walls of the ancient Iksar castle were far from the warmth of his bed in Felwithe, seeing a blue sky again was enough for Loral to realize what home really meant to him.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 6: The Chancellor of Di'Zok</h2>
  
<p>Loral was enraged by the loss at the hands of Lady Vox. Watching his friends crushed and clawed like ants was more than his mind could take. He vowed to find what lead to this treachery and destroy it. He would help rescue Fironia Vie and avenge the deaths of the heroes he fought along.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Months later, while assisting in the war against the Kromdek, great giants who battled the Antonican armies, Loral found a clue. A Sarnak knight had struck at Loral's party and was quickly cut down by the blades of Shagnaz, the ranger, a long time friend of Loral. On his body they found a note signed by the circle of scale. Loral gave the note to Dinirose, Shagnaz' wife, a highly skilled enchanter and expert of dragon lore. She translated the note for Loral.</p>

      <p>The note was from the Chancellor of Di'Zok to his lord. It stated that the circle of scale gave a reward to the lord for his help in protecting Lady Vox. This reward was in the possession of the Chancellor and he would be expecting Di'Zok's gate commander, Korasal Klyseer, to come and pick up the key. Loral had heard stories of this commander, a shadowknight who delighted in reanimating his victims and using them to fight for him later.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral had no intention of it ever being retrieved. He traveled back to the Lake of Ill Omen, a land he had traveled when first coming to Kunark. The young warriors of the Elven outpost continued their battles with the Sarnak at a fort deep within the area. Loral met up with the armies of Vie and found out that a small infiltration team had made it inside the fort but had been routed within. They were trapped inside the Chancellor's dining hall. Loral asked a near by wizard to cast the spell of invisibility on him and he slipped past the guards near the rear of the complex.</p>

      <p>When inside, he heard the snarls of the beasts all around him. They passed him by in groups of three or four all heading to the outskirts of the fort where the battles raged on. Loral continued deeper within the fort until a Sarnak spellcaster, an extremist, sensed his presence. As soon as Loral heard the familiar chant of the Sarnak he countered with a wave of power that blew the spellcaster on his back. Another chant to Tunare drew roots through the stone floor and immobilized the unconscious beast. Loral open his hands and prayed to Tunare to release her wrath on the creature and a ball of magical energy blew the Sarnak into pieces. Loral smiled at his own power, noting how often he had to battle with such beasts with far less desirable outcomes.</p>

      <p>Loral continued into the Chancellor's dining hall, sliding past those Sarnak legionnaires and recruits who guarded the place. Inside he found the small band of adventurers that had been trapped within. He healed and cast magical protections on the party who began their preparations to escape the room. As they finalized their preparations to leave, the Chancellor stepped into the hall.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The Chancellor of Di'Zok was physically large for his race, standing at almost two and a half meters. A spiritual wolf walked in with him, it's Grey eyes hollow and lifeless. In his hand he carried a massive spear inlaid with jade runes that glowed with a magical light.</p>

      <p>Loral wasted no time. The band had already cleared out the Sarnak guards who the Chancellor had expected to protect him, so their time to strike was at hand. Loral called a wave of force, which slammed the Chancellor hard. The Chancellor was not as easily defeated as the extremist Loral had battled earlier, but the stunning blow still slowed him down. Loral, hit him with the retribution of Tunare. While the damage was mighty, the large Sarnak took it in stride. The Chancellor's wolf started charging at Loral, running at inhuman speeds. Loral expected the dog to knock him down and probably begin to tear him apart. He gritted his teeth and took comfort in the fact that he would die in the name of Tunare and Felwithe, when the armored barbarian, Tinyfeet, slammed the wolf with his shield, sending it sprawling just before it hit Loral. Loral ignored the cries of the wolf as the party cut and blasted it down, concentrating on calling spell after spell upon the Chancellor. The Chancellor's own majiks were mighty even without his wolf companion and Loral felt the sting of electricity soar through his armor and into his bones. Loral stood his ground through the onslaught of spells and finally the Chancellor fell to the ground dead, smoke rising from his eyes and mouth.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral whispered a prayer to Tunare and his wounds faded away. He walked over to the smoldering corpse and picked up the jade spear. The party finished off the wolf and cheered at each other and at Loral. Loral only looked at the spear and wondered whether this was the reward that cost the lives of so many.</p>

      <p>After regrouping and preparing for their escape, the party made it's way back out into the sunlight and into the ranks of the army of Vie. Unlike the rest of the party, Loral found little comfort in their escape. Instead he found his rage building even more, telling him to travel to Chardok and give this necromancer the reward he so richly deserved. Loral ate silently before his journeys, imagining what rewards he would give the shadowknight, Klyseer, for the deaths of his friends</p>

  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 7: General V'Ghera</h2>
  
<p>After his battles at the Sarnak fortress, Loral returned to the Elven outpost of Fironia Vie. A cool breeze smelling of the salt from Timorous Deep lulled him to sleep under the statue of Tunare. Fully refreshed the next morning, loral visited the local cleric's guild and received a message from a young page. The message was short but hit Loral like a hammer. Ciric, Loral's mentor, was in trouble. Loral immediately booked passage back to Faydwer to help his old friend.</p>

      <p>It took Loral far to long to locate his mentor, who apparently was visiting the temples in Quenos. By the time he reached the human city of Freeport it was too late for him to continue his travels. Luckily, Brianna, a member of Healers United was able to travel to Quenos in Loral's stead and save Ciric just in the nick of time. The vile Tier'Dal had hired an assassin to murder Ciric as he helped the young warriors of Quenos clean up the rats, bats and snakes that plagued the front gates. Ciric received Brianna's warning just in time to defeat the assassin and discover his origin.</p>

      <p>Brianna returned the message to Loral of the safety of his mentor and while he was surly relieved to know his friend lived, it did little to ease his heart. Ciric had been specifically targeted by the Tier'Dal, and while this attempt had not succeeded, Loral might not learn of the next.</p>

      <p>A note found on the assassin was signed by General V'Ghera, the field commander of the Tier'Dal armies. According to the Elven war commanders in Felwithe, General V'Ghera was leading the Tier'Dal against the human outpost of High Keep.</p>

      <p>Tier'Dal necromancers and dark clerics had raised the dead of ancient armies from a long forgotten war buried deep under the Kithicor forest to fight for them. The undead attacks on High Keep had been raging for a year, but the Tier'Dal only sent in their undead minions at night, clawing their way out of the cursed grounds at dusk and returning to their graves in the mourn.</p>

      <p>Loral had learned that the General himself had recently traveled to Kithicor along with his personal lieutenants, priests and spellcasters. He would be taking a personal interest in the fall of High Keep. As part of his plans, he sent out his circle of assassins across all of Norrath to eliminate those who opposed him. Great military leaders from the human, elven and even barbarian nations were killed as they slept or ate in their homes. This is how enough came into danger. The General felt that Ciric's assistance to the human armies of Quenos was enough to sign his death warrant. And upon learning of the failure, it would certainly invoke a stronger attack later.</p>

      <p>The decision for Loral was not difficult. For the horrors they inflicted on the dead of Kithicor, the constant murder of High Keep's citizens and the attack upon his mentor, Loral declared his own personal war against the General and his army.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral traveled quickly to Kithicor with the help of the druids in his guild. Many of the battle groups around High Keep spent their time defending the keep from the undead armies, but a small team was being put together with the intent of inhabitants the dark elven camp which resided in a burned out cabin. Loral didn't wish to think about what happened to the original inhabitants. He asked to join this raiding party, offering his powers as a cleric of Tunare.</p>

      <p>The infiltration team was lead by a rogue named Wyen. Loral thought him to be a half elf, but almost every time Loral layed eyes on him, he had shifted into some other race whether it be gnome, or even dark elf. Loral had no idea what race Wyen really was, perhaps he was simply a shadow. While his origin may undetermined, his ability to command the small group into a single fighting entity was not questioned. The party traveled from the canyon entrance of High Keep into the deep wood of Kithicor. During the day, the band found no troubles, but at night, the undead shrieked and lumbered around them. Many of the horrid beasts rushed in to attack the group but found themselves blasted down with spells and steel.</p>

      <p>On the second night, one of these vile creatures rushed out of the dark woods and attacked Loral personally. It was a ghoulish creature, hunched over with yellow eyes, but even after centuries under the ground, Loral could still tell that this fearsome beast was once a high elf. The ghoul swung on Loral with a dark morningstar, which tore into Loral's robes. The beast swung again, catching Loral in the side. Loral heard the cracking of his ribs, but the pain hadn't hit him yet. Loral whispered a chant and the ghast's eyes were filled with the horror of his own existence. As the beast fled into the woods, Loral called the earth to rise and hold the undead elf in place. Loral called another set of prayers that drew out the dark forces which animated the husk of this poor soul. It fell to the ground in a heap.</p>

      <p>Loral couldn't move. His ribs had torn up his internal organs and he was slowly bleeding to death. A dwarven cleric noticed Loral's state and was quick to call upon her own diety to heal Loral's wounds and mend the broken bones. Freshly healed, he then examined the corpse and what he found made him weep. Not only was this horror once a high elf, but a high elven cleric of Tunare. The symbol around his neck had only one meaning and apparently even Tunare's blessing could not stop the Tier'Dal from using his corpse against her.</p>

      <p>The dark morning star lay at the beasts feet, a blue-black glow around it. Loral picked it up. The first feeling he got was the sheer weight of the thing. Even though it was not large in sized, it felt as heavy as a giants axe. That feeling was quickly forgotten as the warmth and strength of the weapon flowed into him. Hazy visions of the wars of the past filled his head. Ancient battles with dragons and giants, ceremonies between the high elves and the wood elves and finally the darkness and hate of being driven from the earth. All of these visions hit Loral in a matter of seconds, and quickly they were gone. Only the warmth and comfortable vibration of the weapon remained.</p>

      <p>The next day passed and Wyen began giving orders to the team, forming into small battle groups. A few hours later, Wyen's personal group left to pull the General and his escort into the trap they prepared.</p>

      <p>One of the wizards in the group had used his magic to view through the eyes of Wyen. As soon as the trap was sprung, he yelled out to the rest of the group to get ready. Within moments, Wyen had returned with the Tier'Dal commanders behind him.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Even after realizing the trap, the General and his party fought like wild animals. Adjutant D'Kan, one of the General's master assassins wielding two magical scimitars, cut through the teams like an entire army. His blades twisted and sliced into the joints in armor and into the soft skin beneath. Four great and mighty warriors dropped to his blades in a matter of seconds. Only the icy blasts of a team of wizards froze him in place and pummeled him to the ground. One of the Tier'Dal wizards draped waves of magical fire over the casters, searing their flesh. But she was quickly slammed by the shield of a huge barbarian warrior and cut down with his blade.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The General himself fought like no other warrior Loral had ever seen. He did not rush in, taking his time to judge his opponent. When someone charged in, he deflected the blow easily with his shield, not taking the brunt of the attack but letting it roll off. The his sword would cut in perfectly, dropping this opponents like training dummies. The casters spells made few marks on him, as if the protection of Innoruuk kept their spells at bay.</p>

      <p>Warm waves traveled from Loral's hands to the damaged fighters, closing up wounds and soothing burns. The General saw that with the healing powers of the clerics behind them, the warriors would eventually cut him down. He vaulted over a charging ranger and sliced into the line of healers. Two of them fell to the ground faster than Loral had ever seen. The General's eyes fixed on Loral's and he smiled stepping casually over the corpses he left in his wake. Loral whispered his final prayer to Tunare and waited for the blade of the General to run him through. Suddenly the General stopped. He looked down at the morning star in Loral's hand and smiled a little. Then his sword fell to the ground and he collapsed. Loral was confused, looking at the morning star. Then he saw the large wound that ran from the shoulder down to his right hip in the Generals back. Wyen appeared out of the darkness behind him and smiled. His curved blade was red with the lifeblood of the General.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>What remained of the war party cheered in their victory. Loral returned the lives of the fallen clerics who in turn returned the lives of the other fallen adventurers. In time they returned in victory to High Keep.</p>

      <p>The undead still plagued the forest, but this time in disarray instead as an organized party. Loral had nightmares of their torment, forced to fight in a never ending war instead of sleeping in the rest they so richly deserved. Still, High Keep was once again protected and Ciric was safe from the clutches of General V'Ghera. Still a dark voice spoke to Loral, reminding him of the battles he had yet to fight. Feeding him the visions of the Maestro of Rancor stealing his father into Hate. Of the slaughter of so many noble warriors. The kidnapping of Tunare's daughter. These dark images kept him from spending the time resting in Felwithe that he planned and he soon left to venture back into battle.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 8: The City of Mist</h2>
  
<p>It had been a week since Loral assisted in the battles with General V'Ghera and his minions. Azile had convinced Loral to spend a few days resting in Felwithe before returning back to his war against the Ring of Scale. The return home had partially served its purpose, Loral was rested, but far from relaxed.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral pulled the large locked chest out from underneath the bed in his small apartment. He opened the chest and milled around the contents, not really sure what he was looking for. He pushed aside his golden armor, rewards from the temple of Solsek Ro. A layer of dust had accumulated on it since he packed it away. He now wore a much lighter Jarsath scale armor he found on Venril Sather's undead minions in Karnor's Castle. Many of his traveling possessions had been replaced with more practical items. More practical in battle. The priests of Tunare frowned on this, but they never faced the beasts Loral had killed.</p>

      <p>Then he saw what he had apparently been looking for. The dusty skull smiled at him once again, the grin making Loral's heart sink. He had thought the item lost, or sold on one of his many trips to the Oasis bazaar, but there it was. Seeing the skull gave Loral an introspective view of his life. In his recent days, battling for the freedom of the Elven nations and the word of Tunare, all he had seen was death. The very city he grew up in seemed foreign compared to the battlefield of the Dreadlands. The stink and blood of hundreds of creatures replaced the pristine robes he used to wear. While he often reminded himself that he was the hand of Tunare, the black empty eyes of the skull showed him the raw truth. He was not her hand, he was her fist.</p>

      <p>That night nightmares raked through his sleep. Thousands of years ago a mighty city of the Iksars was destroyed because of the treachery of one of their leaders. While the citizens led their normal daily lives, no different than those of Felwithe, one of their elders made a pact with demons for nothing other than personal gain. The pact led to the death of all of the men, women and children of the city and it became lost for a millennia. Their spirits still roamed the city, unable to rest after the demons raised them from the earth. This traitor still ruled over the city, far above in his tower while the innocent cry for their loss below.</p>

      <p>Loral woke staring at the dark battleworn mace he had picked up in Kithicor. The screams of children as they are torn apart by black demons echoed through his head while he looked at the dull gray aura that surrounded it. Once again Tunare sent him on a mission. He must find this lost city and avenge the deaths of so many innocents.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>His years in Kunark gave Loral a keen knowledge of many of the lost monuments to the Iksar's past. It was not long before he found the city, following the rumors and lore of those he fought with. He even had discovered a group of adventurers also seeking the lost city. There he reunited with his friend, Desjardins, the barbarian shaman. Together they traveled via spell and by foot through the overgrown Emerald Jungle and to the entrance of the city.</p>

      <p>Thousands of years ago it had been a mighty city. Giant Iksar statues adorned every pillar, guarding the gates with their stone blades. Inside the city, a feeling of gloom touched the hearts of the adventurers. A true horror had been unleashed here, there was no doubt.</p>

      <p>Upon entering the city, they were immediately attacked by the ghosts of long dead Iksar. Their icy touch sought to tear the life from the adventurers, but the adventurers were strong. Magical blades and powerful spells tore the spirits to ethereal shreds. Huge lumbering golems, magical creations by some powerful wizards slammed into the warriors' line of defense sending them sprawling. Only the mightiest casters could blast their clay bodies down.</p>

      <p>Further into the city they crept. Past the inns, merchant shops and houses of the dead until they reached a courtyard. Here they established a battle camp. Scouts would enter further and draw out the horrors that laid within.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>These horrors came in the shape of giant black constructions, called Black Reavers. Their armored skin so black and lifeless that spells were simply absorbed into it. No eyes stared at the adventures and no sound aside from the slamming of unearthly metal could be heard from within the depths of their skin. The casters switched to increasing the strength and protection of their warriors who cut, slashed and bashed the beasts until they fell, one right after another. Upon cutting down the last one, a spirit of an ancient wizard was released from within the black vessel and rained fire upon the party before being destroyed by the mighty adventurers.</p>

      <p>The adventures fought their way into a keep near the back of the city battling the unholy Reavers along the way. Inside, they discovered a hidden corridor that led to magical translucent ramps. These ramps took the adventurers up into the sky above the city. Houses and great halls floated above, held up by ancient and powerful magics.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Upon entering one of these halls, the party was ambushed by a team of undead warriors and casters. The lord they sought was apparently aware of their presence. The battle raged for an hour with both groups using magic to bring back their fallen heroes and unleashing the powers of gods upon each other. With nearly total losses, the adventures were finally victorious, cursing the last wrath that stood in their way.</p>

      <p>After bringing back their dead, the party continued, walking carefully along the pathways that spanned a kilometer above the city below. Finally they reached the lord's tower. It stood untouched and silent ready to unleash hell upon the heroes. A thief of the party went in to draw out the lord and within seconds, they were attacked by another fist of Reavers. Each one fought with the force of an army and did so completely without emotion. They were simply constructions built for death. Loral felt a chill through him when this thought crossed his mind. When the final one fell, Neh'Ashiir, the traitor, raised from the remains of the armored hulk. The party felt a new rush, facing this demon and unleashed all they had. The lord rained poison and fire upon them, dropping many a strong warrior. Wizard's spells were interrupted with a choking cloud of noxious gas. Loral feared they would lose. Then the magical blades of a dozen fighters cut deep into him and Neh'Ashiir fell.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral stepped over to the fallen specter, wishing to see the face of such a horrid creature. What he saw made him stop short. The face was of an old wrinkled Iksar, nothing more. His eyes were gray and sad, no hate could be seen in them. Loral could still feel the sting of the creature's spells, but he felt no hate. Neh'Ashiir was as much a pawn to the dark forces of Norrath as anyone. Loral felt tears come to his eyes.</p>

      <p>The rest of the adventurers split the treasure of the tower with one another. Ancient artifacts of a long lost culture were given to the mightiest adventurers. They quickly regrouped and made the decision to continue the battle against the undead of this scarred city. Loral no longer wished to continue the battle, he had seen enough pain. He bade his friends good will and returned to his home. His home along the scorched earth of the Dreadlands.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 9: Innoruuk's Fist</h2>
  
<p>Loral was surrounded by the dark ones. Unholy priests, beasts of nightmares and the walking dead of ancients stared at the Kaoa'Dal Cleric. While any one of these beasts could have slain Loral in seconds, it was not them he was afraid of, or even paying attention to.</p>

      <p>The lord of Hate, father of lies, god of demons stood in front of Loral, towering over him. He was flanked by the slayer of Loral's father, the Maestro of Rancor, and a charred construction that resembled a female dark elf brandishing the tools of a torturer. Lord Innoruuk smiled at Loral as if welcoming an old friend.</p>

      <p>"You have grown mighty, young one. Who would have thought that the simple act of retrieving my hammer could have created such a power as I feel in you." Loral could feel the mockery pouring threw him with every word. "I see you have tossed aside those dry tomes of yours and now brandish a weapon, what a sadness that must be to your Lady, Tunare."</p>

      <p>"It is a weapon of my people, Demon. It was wielded by an ancient priest against your minions a thousand years ago. It's name is Kathalo'r. It has slain your children and now it will slay you." Loral said swinging the black battleworn morning star back from underneath his cloak.</p>

      <p>"I too have a weapon, young one." Innoruuk spoke, lifting an identical black mourning star into Loral's gaze. As Loral stared into the eternal blackness of the weapon, he felt himself waking from this horrible dream. When his eyes opened, the final words echoed throughout his mind.</p>

      <p>"It is called Loral"</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 10: Trakanon</h2>
  


      <p>Twelve dark robed figures stood in the large room. One stood near the center, his hood pulled back exposing his scaled head and dark red eyes. He turned to the rest, taking each of the other eleven in his gaze. No words were spoken and none needed to be. The voices of the eleven fill his head, and he responded with thoughts of his own. These twelve were the only hope of keeping Sebilis, the greatest city of the Iksar, from falling to the beast of nightmares. The unhooded figure hissed at them one final time ceasing their conversation and raised his hands. Suddenly, the twelve appeared a mile under the earth in the cavern that the creature called home. This was the outpost where the Froglok warriors and sorcerers had poured out and devastated the entire city. The twelve turned around and faced the beast. They called the energy of the planes to their grasp twisting and forming it into a single beam capable of destroying a city. The beam turned rivers into steam and rock into glass. It struck the beast in his massive green chest, scorching a hole through the thick skin, through his scarred ribcage and past the cavity that should have contained his vital organs. Trakanon laughed and seconds later the sorcerers died. The mightiest empire Kunark had ever known was lost forever.</p>

      <p>Two thousand years later, Loral Ciriclight, Vicar of Tunare, stood just a few meters from where the Iksar sorcerers had died. He and his war party stood at the foot of a narrow, rotting bridge that led into the undead dragon's cavern. Loral had prepared his group with spells of protection from Trakanon's deadly breath and fierce attacks, but he feared these would be little protection against the ancient wurm. Still his group was ready to do battle.</p>
      


      <p>Months he had spent in the swamps and jungles of Kunark, seeking the ancient ruins of the once mighty city. Finally he had found it, deep in the jungle of Trakanon's Teeth. A huge stone archway led to rows of enormous Iksar statues guarding the walkway. Loral found a cavern inside one of the outlying buildings that led deep under the city. The corridor winded hundreds of feet underground until it ended in a large room. In the center, a huge ruby orb bathed the room with a brilliant red light. Only the idol of Trakanon, an ancient key of an ancient time, would allow passage into the depths of Sebilis. Loral had one such idol.</p>

      <p>Now Loral faced that small rotten bridge, knowing that death sat on the other side. They had little problems with the Froglok guards. Deeper within the caverns they defeated the Sebilite Juggernaughts and Trakanon's personal guard, the Sebilite Protector. They reformed their attack groups and now waited for the orders to charge. After what seemed like an eternity, the order came.</p>

      

      <p>Loral's group was the first to charge in. They turned the corner and faced the beast. Trakanon smiled at them. He raised his head hundreds of feet into the air and swept his hollow eyes across the group, then they fixed upon Loral. The warriors and rangers immediately began slashing at the dragon, cutting into his thick, rotten skin. But Loral was transfixed with the beast's eyes. Tiny specks of intense light pierced into Loral from the dark caverns where apparently Trakanon once had eyes. Unlike the other dragons Loral had faced, he felt no fear. Instead he felt something he truly didn't expect to feel. The beasts pain.</p>

      <p>Time slowed down. The room went silent. Loral stood, his battleworn mace hanging at his side, while his group charged in. Trakanon's gaze didn't move from Loral's. A millennia of isolation, the horror of living in death, the pain of existing for thousands of years as a rotting corpse. All of these hit Loral like waves of ice. Then with the boom of a wizards blast, time sped back up. Trakanon's gaze shifted off of Loral and he returned to the battle at hand.</p>
      

      <p>Trakanon lifted his head and breathed his poison breath on the war party. Spells were choked off and mighty warriors fell to their knees under the thick stench of death. Loral opened up his heart to Tunare and began releasing her healing energy into the warriors of his group. Tendrils of swirling light faded away the burns of corrosion the poison left on the mighty warriors, but the taint had sunk in. Loral felt his own life-force fading under the vile poison. He drained every ounce of spiritual energy he had, giving it to himself and his party. Still the poison tore at them from the inside of their lungs and from within their blood. Soon the heroes began falling to the plague that engulfed them. Loral took a final look at the battle as his legs became weak. Half the warriors fell like timber, the other half slashed and blasted with every last ounce they had in them. Then blackness overtook Loral's vision and he collapsed to the ground.</p>

      <p>"What has happened to you Loral, what happened to the wide eyed acolyte ready to spread the word of Tunare with peace and love?" Ciric Azilebane sat at the small tavern in Quenos across from Loral. Loral had just related the story of General V'Ghera to Ciric who did not seem impressed with the killing of the General and his minions. "You left the gates of Felwithe wearing a priest's robes and carrying the Testament of Vanear. Now you wear the blood of your enemies like some dark badge of honor. Even the high priests of Tunare don't approve of your actions anymore, most fear you to much to tell you. Your books of scripture and history have been replaced with a burnt shield and that black mace."</p>

      <p>"Enough!" Loral stood, his chair falling backwards onto the floor. The tavern went silent. "Those fools in Felwithe have no idea what they speak of. They wish to spread the word of Tunare, hoping it's mere speaking will turn all the world's evil away. Even you believe you can make a difference, giving your protection to the hunters of rats and snakes. We are at war, Ciric. Evil pours out of the earth from every cave, every hole and every swamp of this world. Once peaceful woods are now haunted by powerful armies of undead right outside our door. You can hide behind your robes and your scripture and close your eyes, but I cannot. Beasts you can't even imagine will crawl past these walls and kill our children if we don't do something about it. And I will." Loral got up and left the bar. It was the first time he had ever had a conversation like that with Ciric and it broke his heart. He gritted his teeth against the tears and started his preparations to go back to Kunark.</p>

      <p>The memory faded as warmth flowed through Loral's veins. His eyes opened to the plump face of a female dwarven cleric. She smiled warmly at him, stood up and walked to the next corpse. Loral got to his feet, still very weak from the resurrection, and looked around. Trakanon's corpse filled the hall. Small bands of the survivors sat and regained their strength as clerics walked from group to group, putting their hands on their wounds. Loral walked over to the enormous corpse.</p>
      

      <p>The fire still burned in Trakanon's eyes, but they focused on nothing. Adventurers wandered around the corpse looking at the wounds of a thousand battles. Loral reached into the jaw of the giant beast and tore free one of the dagger sized teeth. He pulled off the red wurm scale he wore around his neck, and hung the tooth there in its place. Then, whispering a prayer to Tunare, he left. The ancient horror of Sebilis, destroyer of a nation, Trakanon, had fallen.</p>

      <p>Deep in the bowels of his dark citadel, under the eternally black sky and air filled with the screams of innocence, Innoruuk laughed. He sat on his throne, staring into the fire that burned from the broken bones of Elven clerics and druids, now crushed under Innoruuk's hand. In it he saw Loral tie the dragon tooth around his neck. Behind Innoruuk stood a dark cleric, dressed completely in blackened charred armor, his face pale and featureless. Innoruuk turned and gazed at his minion, who stood ready to serve. "Soon we will be ready, my friend, and then you can have him."</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 11: Battle</h2>
  

        
      

      <p>Korasal Klyseer had been in the services of the Di'Zok Royals for over a century. He enjoyed his position as the commander of the Di'Zok troops stationed outside Chardok and was proud to offer his protection. This latest news he received, of the possible betrayal and death of the Overking's Chancellor was not good news. He awaited a message from the outpost by the Lake of Ill Omen on the situation. He received it in the form of fire as it exploded from the ground around him, immediately followed by the sting of two arrows as they entered his chest. His skeletal minion rushed to meet the forces, but was torn to pieces by a white spiritual ball of light. A burly fighter in bronzed armor rushed up to fight Korasal face to face. Korasal touched him and felt the energy of the fighters onslaught seep out of him. The Klyseer quickly cut him down with a stroke from his blade, the Runic Carver. His victory became small when wolves burst out of the trees and tore into his legs, taking him to the ground. Two more cuts from the blades of a ranger had him gasping for one last breath. He turned and looked into the blue rage filled eyes of Loral Ciriclight.</p>

      <p>"Your chancellor sends you a message." Loral said before smashing the 200 year old dark knight's head open with the battleworn morningstar of Kelethin.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Prince Selrach Di'Zok was discussing the latest plans of his father and mother to increase the forces around the goblin strongholds near the Frontier with his advisors, when the front door to their keep came smashing down with the fists of a huge elemental. His advisors, both skilled sorcerers, immediately began chanting their spells of protection while the Prince unleashed his own dark magics, tearing the elemental into chunks of dirt. The mercenary battle group that laid siege to the keep began pouring in, cutting with the might of an army and casting arcane spells only spoken by the mightiest sorcerers in Norrath. Fires burned and ice blasted from both sides in the battle. Cuts deep enough to slay the mightiest fighters were healed before they bled. After seconds that seemed like hours, the sorcerer advisors of the prince stood captivated, unable to move under the magical whispers of enchanters, while the prince was slain and beheaded. Loral picked up the head and set it on a red velvet chair who's cost could feed the city of Felwithe for a year. Let that be the first thing the Overking sees when he returns, he thought.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The ancient books of the the Iksar describe the last days of Venril Sather's role as the emperor of their people. They describe his reign of terror as he ruled all of Kunark with an iron fist. They speak of his love for another practitioner of his dark art, the Necromancer Druzilla. With her he found his only true happiness, and it was shortly taken from him when she was assassinated by those in his senate who opposed him. His rage was felt by every living thing on the continent. His most loyal servants were sealed in the tomb of his beloved, cursed to live forever screaming within the mountain city of Charisis. Before he went into seclusion, he gave the key to the tomb to the only servant he could trust. His spy within the Chardok empire, Xalgoz the Vampire. Children were threatened with a visit from Xalgoz should they not behave, and the name became a slang term used within the vulgar mouths of the sailors of the Overthere, but nothing else was ever heard of the legend. Loral knew otherwise. His hunt of the undead of Kunark led him to a tomb outside the new cities of Cabilis. Deep within, past the spectral guardians and skeletal minions, Loral faced and destroyed the vile Xalgoz. From the mouth of the vampire he tore free a tooth. The tooth implanted by Sather two thousands years earlier as the key to Drusella's resting place.</p>

      <p>Venril Sather, the lich-king of the Iksar empire, sat on his granite throne imbued with his dark power. The throne fed him the visions of the outskirts of his keep, the ancient castle of Karnor. He enjoyed the constant strife of the outlanders as they battled with his army of lycanthropes. The mighty Drolvargs tore into the skin and bones of their victims, sending them screaming into the sands of the dead land around the castle. Sather had to admit that the armies of the outlanders were well organized and powerful, but his unlimited supply of undead kept them from ever penetrating his fortress. He was safe within his inner palace, protected by his powers, harvested by the perversion of nature throughout the two thousand years he resided here.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Sather was about to contact his spies within the outpost city of Fironia Vie when a young barbarian warrior in blue armor stepped into the door. Silence laid heavy as the two looked at one another. The lich could hardly believe a living thing had managed to even step foot into his throne room, but here he was. Then the instinctive twinge of hunger as he imagined the life force this young warrior must have rang in his mind and he smiled. Floating off of his throne he approached the warrior. Instead of cringing in fear, the warrior swung his twin diamond headed blades and cut into the dead skin of the lich. Sather ignored the cuts, knowing that soon they would close while the life force of the fighter was drained of his body. He thrust his clawed hand at the chest of the warrior, but hit an invisible barrier just before penetrating his armor. Confused and angered, he cut again. The warrior continued slicing into Sather, his blades mostly glancing off of the spells of protection Sather had in place. Sather howled with rage and continued to rip at the warrior, still hitting nothing but air. He was so angered he didn't realize the others that entered the room. Wizards, enchanters, rangers and monks entered, each beginning to cut, bash and blast into Sather's spiritual armor. Enchanters refreshed the energy shields around the single warrior when Sather began to come close to breaking through. Never once was he able to recharge his life force. Soon his own spells failed and he fell to the mighty party.</p>

      <p>Loral stepped through the door, along with a small halfling dressed all in black. The halfling smiled at the corpse of Sather, as did Loral.</p>

      <p>"An excellent job my friend, even Sather's runes of protection were not enough to stop your nimble fingers. Tunare thanks you, as do the citizens of Fironia Vie." The halfling nodded, but smiled greatly when Loral dropped a heavy sack of gems into the halfings hand. Loral had learned what drove these men and knew how to get what it was he required. As the rest of the party looted the room, Loral studied many of the tomes and parchments around the room, searching feverishly for the information he sought. Finally he found a dusty book with an ancient symbol of a lost religion on the cover. He sat crossed legged on the floor and poured over the pages, careful not to let them fall apart in his hands. His eyes widened and his mouth curled into a smile.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>A universe away, in a land of ever green pastures, where the woods walked in harmony with the spiritual animals of dreams and wishes, the Mother looked into her pool of visions. She witnessed the deaths of the four pillars of evil in Kunark. She watched as they were slain in her name. She watched as Loral studied the tomes of ancient lands, travel into the depths of dungeons and talk with the loremasters and scribes. She saw Loral at the bazaar in the Commons after spending a week in the depths of Sebilis. She watched him trade for a book from an old grave robber. Skimming the pages he smiled and tucked the book into his pack. He pick up his blackened shield and dark mace and then the visions within Tunare's scrying pool collapsed. She spent a few moments more watching the dark waters of the pool, hoping her visions would return. When they didn't, Tunare wept.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 12: Darkness and Light</h2>
  
<p>The departure of their apostle gave the priests of Tunare a small break from their normal bickering and arguing about the coming of the dark ages and the sins of the local tavern, Tovonia's Venom, next door. Young Loral had been with them for seven years, having come to them as an orphan at the age of 10. They knew he wouldn't stay with them forever. His path led out into the world of Norrath, spreading the word of Tunare. The young lad had the sparkle of adventure in his eyes, and it was hard not to feel the same wanderlust when looking at his shining dwarven mail tunic and his worn leather backpack, gifts from the mysterious Ciric Azilebane. Yeolarn Bronzeleaf smiled at Loral as he shook his hand and bowed to the young adventurer, but inside his heart sank. The world held dangers that many couldn't even comprehend, much less survive. He gave Loral one chance in five of returning to them alive. Allia Moondancer, Loral's teacher of the arts, gave Loral a kiss on the cheek and whispered a prayer of safety upon him. Loral blushed, stood up straight and walked out the doors. Yeolarn whispered a prayer himself, hoping it would not be the last time he saw young Loral alive.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>It was. The figure that stepped back into the Church of Tunare was no longer the young acolyte of Tunare. Loral stepped into the room with swirling lavender boots forged in worlds of darkness. His green robe shifted and shimmered with a life of it's own. His skin had been hardened by the heat of Kunark and the icy winds of Velious, but no part of him was as hardened as his eyes. One gaze gave Yeolarn a view of the horrors and wonders that had passed before Loral. One look was all that was needed for both men to understand the depths of what had happened in the past years. Loral kneeled to the clerics of the church, and tears began flowing from his eyes. Yeolarn's eyes too began to tear. He had hoped that this day would come, that he would see Loral alive again. But after seeing those eyes, he felt that perhaps this fate was the less merciful alternative.</p>

      <p>A storm was blowing over the ancient arena. Clouds moved across the sky faster than the wolves of the Karanas, while lightening struck the ground near by. Many warriors had fought and died in the Arena, and Loral knew that this day would be no different. His preparations for the summoning of Innoruuk were almost complete. While battles raged around him, the focus of hate burning in his chest kept him thinking of the confrontation he would soon face. No spells or blades could stop Loral from seeking the revenge he had sought his whole adult life. One hand held the ancient book of Obulus open to the pages of summoning, the other held the burning black mace of Kithicor, which glowed with a black light. The summoning was almost complete. Then a figure stood in his way. Dressed in the white gowns of a young cleric of Tunare, Idoru, a fellow Healer in his guild and apostle of the Mother stood fast. "Don't do this, Loral. You are under the influence of Innoruuk. Stop this now." Loral looked into her blue eyes, knowing she was right. His heart ached and tears welled up in his eyes. He reached out a hand to her, whispering a prayer to Tunare...and killed her.</p>

      <p>Loral woke with a jolt. That same dream had followed him every night since it took place, weeks earlier. And like it did every morning, his hand burned and he felt the loss of the dark mace, even though its evil had been destroyed that same day. The darkness of its curse still had not left him, but he hoped that it would this day. He sat up on the cold stone, not refreshed, but rested for the coming battle. While he became aware of his dark surroundings, the unnatural stone walls of Innoruuks outer halls of the Plane of hate, the sound of scraping metal sent a shiver through his bones. Loral looked up at Boldog, the large barbarian warrior, sharpening his blade. He watched the barbarian's one good eye, the other cut through from some past battle. He watched and knew the man would soon be dead. Seeing the look in Boldog's eye as he sharpened his huge sword, he knew that the warrior knew it as well. Only a few might survive their battles with the demon-god. More than likely none would. But the warrior knew that the stronger he fought, the more likely he would be killed, for if any gets the attention of Innoruuk, they die.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>A half hour later, Loral was staring at that one good eye again, this time lifeless. He was walking among the wounded of the horrific battle, healing those who could be healed and offering the last rights of Tunare to those he couldn't. Then he came across the body of Boldog and had to stop. He sat there, regaining his strength, but weary of heart. So many dead, so much loss. Then the impact of their accomplishment woke him from this trance. Behind the fighter, lay the corpse of Innoruuk. They had defeated the Lord of Hate. Loral remembered the battle in bits in pieces. He remembered hearing Innoruuk chanting the names of those in the war party, tearing into their souls and stripping them of their lives. "AILEN...VAGE...SOMNUS...WADEN...BOLDOG". One by one the adventurers fell. While wizards unleashed their powerful spells and warriors cut with magical blades, Innoruuk continued to chant. "SOLRAK...RAIZZE...TALTHAR...RAICA." When the mobs of warriors became too thick, he raised his hands and sent the remaining adventurers flying through the air, smashing up against walls and sliding hundreds of feet across the floor. The adventurers quickly regained their footing and rushed the Lord of Hate again. Then, when all appeared lost, Innoruuk stumbled and fell. The blades and spells of the mighty party had finally cut him down.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The sheer scope of what Loral had done took a long time to sink in. Sitting there, looking at the corpse of the dark god, Loral thought about what this meant. His whole adult life he had sought this moment. Since the day his father was taken by the Maestro of Rancor, Loral vowed revenge. Now the Maestro lay dead in the hallway after attempting to defend his master, and Innoruuk was killed shortly there after within his own inner chambers. Loral had his revenge. But instead feeling the thrill of victory, he only felt emptiness. He had spent his entire life as a vehicle for revenge under Tunare's name. Innoruuk had used Loral's hate against him and he had almost released the demon-god on all of Norrath under the notion that he might possibly defeat him in a duel. Innoruuk had done far worse than simply kill his father. Innoruuk had stolen his soul and used him as a tool of war. Loral claimed to have followed the will of Tunare, but had killed one of Tunare's most noble and pure clerics, all in the name of revenge. And even now, after having defeated Innoruuk on his home ground, now he had nothing left.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>In his early years as an adventurer, Loral had dreams of finding his father in the outerworld prisons of Hate. Those dreams were shattered when he realized just how insignificant he and his father were to Innoruuk. All that he had to show for his life of vengeance was the black scar on his hand from the black mace, and the sadness of knowing he had used the name of his goddess to murder an innocent. He wasn't sure what would become of his life now. But he knew one thing. He must ask for forgiveness. He would seek out the clerics of Felwithe and apologize for his actions in their name. He would then seek out Tunare herself and accept whatever fate she would have for his sins. His only hope was to once again be her hand on Norrath. If not, he would do his best to spread her faith and her love, even if he was doomed by the acts of his past.</p>

      <p>It was a beautiful autumn day in Felwithe. Loral couldn't decide which was warmer. The summer sun overhead or the smile of his father when he pulled up the large bass out of the clear river that ran outside their home. Talien the Jeweler patted his young son on the back, sharing in the joy of the catch. While there were times when Loral became bored of the constant haggling between his father and a customer, the Sunday fishing trips were the times Loral really look forward to. Loral would sit and watch the fish through the clear stream while his father would tell him stories of the far away cities of Kaladim, Kelethin and even Ak'Anon, land of the curious gnomes. Loral would imagine the strange cities of fiery forges and giant machines while his father spoke. Other times, Talien would tell Loral of his mother, and although sometimes they made him sad, he more often felt the happiness that her memory brought to his father. Those fishing trips meant everything to Loral. They were the best moments of his life.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 13: The Kromrif</h2>
  
<p>The bickering between the Church of Tunare and the Paladin's Guild had gone on for hours. Loral almost wished he had stayed the outcast he once was, but then remembered the dark times and thanked Tunare that he was once again her hand in Norrath. Loral sat in the back of the meeting hall, absently twisting one of his velium rings around his finger over and over and watching his green robes swirl while the debate raged on. The subject of whether the Elven nations would support the Coldain Dwarves of Thurgadin against the Kromrif Giants of Kael had gone on for weeks, but today it finally looked as though they might have a plan. They would send in a spy, someone who could find out what the Kromrif had in store for the Elven nations. If their grasp was farther than Thurgadin, the Fier'Dal would make a decision. Before another huge debate started, Loral raised his hand and volunteered for the job. He was already an enemy of the Velious frost giants, he explained, and he had a good idea where to look for this information. He also knew the perfect partner.</p>

      <p>Cold wind bit at Loral's exposed face like a thousand Bixie daggers. It howled over the dunes of white snow and chilled his armor to his skin as he lay face down watching the front of the large fortress. Where is she, he thought as he watched the two frost giant guards outside the keep. It wouldn't be long before the patrol was back and that would mean dealing with four more of these monsters. Loral peeked once again into the Gnomish spyglass, a gift from the druid Wrenne, scanning over the desolate land behind him. She was no where in sight. Then as he was just about to collapse the spyglass, there she was.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Azile Ciricbane, the Erudite Evoker had her dark green hood pressed close in against the biting wind. Loral smiled as he watched her lips wording a thousand curses towards the blizzard above. It appeared that even her elemental armor could not take the sting out of the icy weather. She trudged through the snow, using her long staff to help her make her way, and came up to Loral's position. She looked down at Loral's red boots, a gift from the Healer Akaysa, and sighed. Loral smiled at her.</p>

      <p>"I was wondering how long it was going to take you. We haven't much time. The patrol will be back soo.."</p>

      <p>"We have all the time we need, they will not be back," Azile cut him off without even looking at him. She reached into a bag that hung around her waste and dropped four Velium swords to the ground. "Lets get on with this, I haven't all day." Loral smiled to himself as she continued to walk past him towards the front of the keep, not even bothering to conceal herself from the guards ahead. She was right, he nodded, they had a mission to accomplish.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Deep in the icy lands of the Eastern Wastes, surrounded by tons of rock and a platoon of Kromrif soldiers, Fjloaren Icebane seethed. He had been in charge of this fort for almost five months now and there seemed to be no sign that he would be brought back to Kael and promoted. Five months ago he had been offered his own command, his own garrison of troops and his own fort. Instead of the great stronghold of Wakening Lands, or the forward outpost in Greater Divide, he was given command of the worst post he knew of, the outpost of Eastern Wastes. Instead of immediate promotion and honor of leading armies against the Coldain, Fjloraren spent his days bargaining with the horribly stupid Ry'Gorr orcs or sending out raiding parties to destroy the lumbering Ulthork and the occasional Snow Griffin. Only the most incompetent soldiers working for the Kromrif were ever sent to this fort and it drove Fjloaren mad to know this. Fjloaren pretended to study a map of the area in his hut, while he stewed over this horrible turn of luck. He had no idea that in a short twenty minutes he would be dead.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Guard Kazul's feeble mind couldn't comprehend why this lone woman would walk so boldly towards the front gates of the outpost he guarded, but there she was. Dressed in green robes and carrying a long staff, the figure walked up as if she belonged in the place. He looked over to Faroth, the other guard, and smiled at him. Kazul then saw the thin tendrils, thousands of them, that laced Faroth from the ground all the way to his neck like a package of meat, paralyzing him. Kazul, finally realizing what had happened, reached for his own sword just before his head exploded.</p>

      <p>Although angered that this attack had come as a surprise, Fjloarin was happy to be in battle once again no matter what the circumstances. He lifted his great battle axe from the table and in three steps was outside of his hut. The blast of fire greater than any known in nature almost blew him back into his hut. Outside, a single figure unleashed the flames of hell upon his troops. Azile turned towards another guard who rushed out of the hut next to Fjlorain's, exposing her back to him.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Fjloarin had been passed up many times for promotion for his blind ferocity and rage but he wasn't as stupid as his superiors thought. He carefully walked behind the wizard and raised his axe high. Before he could cleave the wizard in two from the top of her head to the ground below his kneecap burst. Roaring with rage and pain, Fjloarin fell to his good leg and faced his attacker. Loral Ciriclight stood ready to battle the giant. In his hand was a shining mithral mace of the Fier'Dal, the standard weapon for the priests of Tunare, which replaced the dark mace he once held. Loral called Tunare's retribution and an eruption of energy blasted Fjloarin hard. Fjloarin stood up ignoring the crunch his knee made and slashed at the cleric. Loral barely avoided getting severed in half as the huge axe glanced off of his transparent shield. Fjloarin slashed again and Loral ducked out of the way, but not before taking a cut across his shoulder and chest. A kick from Fjloarin sent Loral sprawling. Loral rolled to avoid another cut from the huge axe, but had no where left to go. Fjloarin raised the axe one final time, smiling when he imagined wiping Loral's remains from the blade when his chest exploded outward. For a second he stood there, the four foot hole in his armor spewing smoke into the air. His axe fell out of his hands to the ground and he toppled face first to the ground. Loral stood up, looking at the hole which had burned through the giant's back. Azile's expression hadn't changed since he had seen her walking towards the fort before. Loral called upon the power of Tunare and healed the wound on his chest and shoulder. Together they walked into Fjloarin's hut.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The council meeting was still raging when the doors opened up, splashing sunlight into the great hall. Loral stepped through with Azile behind him. The ambassador of the Kaladim dwarves, a scarred retired general now a diplomat, explained the minds of the dwarves. They were ready to wage war on behalf of their distant cousins, the Coldain, and hoped that the elves would help their cause. The Fier'Dal chancellor explained that their forces could not be spared until more of the situation was known. Loral knew that this indecision would change as the information he carried came to light. The room went silent when he walked to the main table and dropped the documents from the Kromrif outpost on the table. He turned and addressed all the members that sat in the large hall.</p>

      <p>"There is no longer a question of our involvement in this war my friends. We no longer have a choice. The Kromrif are at this moment preparing a siege greater than any they have unleashed against the noble Coldain. They are preparing for war against Tunare herself in the Plane of Growth."</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 14: The Letter</h2>
  
<p>A strange note is delivered to you sealed with the crest of the Clerics of Tunare. You open the note and find the following message written in the handwriting of Loral Ciriclight.</p>

      <p>Ungdin was just like us. He was a loving husband and father of three children. He was a worshiper of his God. He was a merchant and miner. But unlike us, he was a Coldain. Unlike the other Coldains, he didn't live secretly behind the vast mountain caverns. He lived in a small hut on the outskirts of the Eastern Wastes, mining for Velium in the mountains. One day, he came back to his hut after a hard and long day of mining to find his life completely upturned. His wife and his children had been murdered. His hut had been ransacked and all his possessions looted. What beasts would do such a thing to a simple dwarven miner?<br />
      <br />
      The Kromrif of Kael Drakkal.<br />
      <br />
      </p>

      <p>For a thousand years the Kromrif have kept the kindly dwarven nation of Thurgadin in hiding. Their every move brings pain and misery. It is only a matter of time before all nations of Norrath will face the threat of the Kromrif. As nobles of the most honorable guild in Norrath, I ask all the Healers to join me in this war against Kael. Join the Coldain and the Claws of Veeshan as allies against the Kromrif. Battle the vile giants, not the little people or the scaled children of Veeshan. Their strength mixed with our own can be the key to our success.</p>

      <p>As a guild our strength lies with each other. If we choose to battle the giants instead of the Coldain or the claws of Veeshan, we can acquire greater treasure and further our travels into the wastelands of Velious. Portals that would otherwise be completely closed to us will open with loving arms. Quests for treasures beyond our imagination will be achievable. And more importantly, we will be doing the right thing.</p>

      <p>Ungdin now mines within the city of Thurgadin, down in the dark tunnels below. He has managed to rebuild his life as a miner, but not a day goes by where he doesn't miss his wife and children. Help avenge their death and help the Coldain in their eternal struggle with these monsters. Help yourselves in the process by allowing us safe passage through Thurgadin, Skyshrine, Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar. Help yourselves by opening up the treasures of the Temple of Veeshan.<br />
      <br />
       Help us all by proving that we are truly Healer "United".<br />
      <br />
       Your friend,<br />
      <br />
       Loral Ciriclight<br />
       Cleric of Tunare</p>

      <p><br />
      <br />
      /ooc</p>

      <p>The time has come for our guild to decide whether we should support the Coldain, the Kromrif or the Claws of Veeshan. My recommendation based on my experiences in Velious and from the information I have gathered from many of the Everquest web sites is to support both the Coldain and the Claws of Veeshan factions and fight the Kromrif in Kael.</p>

      <p>There are a few reasons for this. Our guild is more likely to be successful on the Thurgadin quests than the Kael quests since the corroded armor drops in Kael. If we do manage to get to the point where we can achieve Kael armor by hunting in the Temple of Veeshan, we can also achieve the Skyshrine quests which results in better armor overall.</p>

      <p>If our Claws of Veeshan faction is higher, it is far easier to travel to the western zones of Velious including Wakening Lands, Cobalt Scar, Sirins Grotto, Western Wastes, Dragon Necropolis, and the Temple of Veeshan. With bad Claws faction, travel in these zones is almost impossible.</p>

      <p>The teleport locations in Wakening Lands and Colbalt Scar are almost totally cut off if you damage your Claws of Veeshan faction, limiting your ability to travel within velious.</p>

      <p>My plan is to run many raids and events in these areas. If your faction follows the plan above, we can have many great adventures in these lands. If not, you may not be able to attend these events.</p>

      <p>Ally yourself with the Coldain Dwarves of Thurgadin, the children of Veeshan in Skyshrine and battle the vile Kromrif of Kael and you will be doing a service to your guild and all of Norrath.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 15: I, Dog</h2>
  
<p>A cool breeze brought the scents of fragrant flowers, cooking meat, and clear waters. The sounds of trees rustling and of a near-by waterfall made Dog's ears perk lazily into the air. Dog was relaxing under the shade of a tree, watching his friend, Rex, wrestle a smaller companion to the ground by grabbing it's hind legs in his mouth and pulling forward. It wasn't angry fighting, it was fun fighting and that made Dog happy. Rex and the younger one bounded and yelped happily at each other. In a little while Dog would join them, but now Dog was full and preferred sit in the soft green grass, listen to the soft sounds, and smell the smells of this happy and green place. Dog had never felt such peace in his life.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Dog woke with a kick to his side and he yelped as he came to his feet. Gone was the soft breeze, replaced by the harsh frigid air as it billowed through the caverns around him. The feeling of his full stomach was replaced with the growling pain of hunger he had known all his life. He looked around for Rex but remembered that he hadn't seen him in some time. Others were there, the mean ones. Dog liked happy fighting, but these others were mean and angry. They smelled of hate and blood. Dog had been here as far back as he could remember. He was always cold and always hungry. Sometimes he would be taken out into the snow where he wasn't allowed to play and chase the small bunnies, but instead had to track for Masser. Most of the time Dog stayed in the icy pit, with the others. They were all cold and hungry and always angry. They weren't nice like Rex was, they didn't like each other and they didn't like him. This made Dog sad, he missed Rex.</p>

      <p>After getting to his feet, Dog suddenly smelled something in the air. Strangers, here in his home. Masser was above him, yelling angrily as usual. He was pushing Dog and the others through the icy caverns and into the larger halls. Everyone was excited, and this made Dog afraid. Strangers didn't often come here, and when they did, it was always exciting. It also meant food, which was good, Dog was very hungry. But it meant something else. It meant the bad word. Dog didn't like the bad word though the others did.</p>

      <p>Masser pushed and kicked them into the main halls where others like Masser were all running around. At the end of the hall, a group of small ones stood. They smelled different than Maser, it was far less strong. They also made sounds much lower and more soothing than the gruff and loud noises Masser and his kind made. There were about twelve of them, in a small pack. They held many sharp things and some had strange lights around their hands and bodies. Masser's people slashed and cut at the small ones with their sharp-sticks, while the small ones dove and dodged.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>When Masser saw the small ones, he kicked Dog forward and Dog knew the bad word would come. Dog hated the word but didn't remember why. Even though it meant a full belly and it made Masser happy, it made Dog sad. But he knew had no choice. The others around him lowered down to the ground, ready to pounce with shouts and howls of excitement. Dog got in line as well, he knew what he must do. Then the word came.</p>

      <p>"Kill!"</p>

      <p>Dog and the others rushed into the mob of small ones. Dog was aware of the others falling or yelping as strange lights hit them or they were poked with the sharp-sticks. He was aware of the sad and dark smells of burning hair and blood. He saw the small ones scatter and lunge, avoiding the charge of Dog and his pack. The others each picked out a small one to wrestle, and Dog picked his as well, a smaller one than even the others, holding a stick and wearing dark robes. Dog almost stopped when the aroma of the small one caught him, it was the smell of the fields and streams he had been dreaming of. A sudden vision of the pond and trees came back but was soon out of his mind as the word struck him again. He bared his teeth and lunged at the small one, knowing that soon the horrible burning in his stomach would be gone. Then the small one spoke to him. It wasn't the guttural noises of Maser, it was smooth and as coherent as he could imagine.</p>

      <p>"He is not your master, he is the enemy. You have been hurt by him and he will hurt you again. Attack him and you will be free. I am your master and I love you."</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Dog's head swam with the memories of his entire life with more clarity than ever before. He remembered the day his mother was taken from him, along with her soothing warmth and mother's milk. He remembered being beaten and yelled at by Masser, being told to "Kill" as he attacked other small ones. He remembered wrestling happily with Rex, but then remembered something very sad. He remembered hearing the word, but this time while in a hole with Rex. Rex heard the word too and they were both sad, they didn't want to wrestle each other down here. But they did. Rex went for his back legs but Dog managed to clamp down on Rex's throat as he rushed in. Dog squeezed even as Rex yelped and thrashed about. He continued to squeeze, feeling warmth drip down his throat and mouth, until Rex went to sleep. Masser took him away and fed him which made him happy, but he never saw Rex again. All of these memories flooded through his mind, but one thought stayed constant. Masser didn't love him.</p>

      <p>He turned and saw Masser shouting the word over and over. He would follow the word, but not on the small one who loved him. Dog rushed and jumped at Masser, sinking his teeth into Masser's throat. Dog smelled the fear inside him. He heard the shouts and excitement from the others around him and heard the high pitched scraping of the sharp-stick Maser kept at his belt. Dog felt a sudden sharp pain in his side. He felt warmth on his side where the pain was, but also felt warmth in his mouth and knew that this was good. Maser fell to the ground with Dog on top of him. The sharp pain came back, this time in his stomach. He heard Masser's sounds of gurgling become softer. Than the sounds stopped. Masser had gone to sleep, and that made Dog happy. Dog tried to stand up but realized he couldn't. He rolled off of Maser and landed on his side in the icy cavern. It was hard to breath. His eyes fell onto the small one who spoke nicely to him, the one who loved him. The small one smiled at him and made soothing sounds that Dog couldn't understand. He knew he had done well and was happy. Then Dog went to sleep.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The cool evening made Dog feel a little sleepy as he sat in the field of grass, watching the fish in the stream. He listened to the quiet sounds of trees rustling and birds chirping. His belly was full and he was happy. When he first arrived here Dog met a tall pretty woman who smelled like the grassy lands around him. When he had wondered what this place was, the woman spoke in a soft voice to him the same way the small one did. The woman told him to be happy, that he would never be hungry, he could sleep when he wished, and could always play with his friend, Rex. Most importantly, he would never have to hear the bad word again. Dog stood up slowly and trotted across the stream. On the other side was Rex, who was chasing a small one around a group of trees. Both Rex and the small one were happy and having great fun. Dog was happy to see his friend again and trotted down to join them. Dog had never felt such peace in his life.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 16: Trouble At Home</h2>
  
<p>The sound of rattling bone and steel on stone echoed along with the screams of the tortured souls in the Plane of Hate. A slender figure strode past the hideously twisted minions of the Dark Lord, taking no notice as they snapped to attention when he passed. Behind the figure walked two enormous trolls wearing the bone armor of ancient beasts and carrying the glowing black blades of Innoruuk's elite guard. The blood red cloak of the Elven figure billowed out behind him, a deep contrast to the dark purple armor and pale skin of Innoruuk's high priest and military advisor. The three figures climbed up the steps of Innoruuk's church and the two trolls turned to guard the entrance as Loral Ciriclight stepped past the great archway. Inside sat the Prince of Darkness upon his throne of the skulls of heroes. Innoruuk smiled.</p>

      <p>"You cannot deny who you are, my friend. Though you were made aware, one cannot change what lies in one's heart." Loral placed his hand over the symbol of Innoruuk that hung around his neck and kneeled before his master.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral woke with a start to the sound of breaking glass from the tavern next door. Apparently another debate over the price of velium or of Kormrif Spit Vodka had erupted into the all too common Coldain bar brawl. Loral had once been shocked and horrified by the event but eventually understood it as a typical social encounter with the sturdy dwarves. Why the bartender insisted on installing a new window every night was a question that always baffled Loral.</p>

      <p>Loral got off his small cot and stretched out. These quarters were a little crampt and didn't offer as much privacy as Loral wished, but living with the Coldain miners offered Loral a perspective of Coldain life that he never would have gotten from the high class inn he was originally offered when he came to stay in Thurgadin.</p>

      <p>Loral put on his green robes of Tunare and began to step outside of the small apartment when he found a sealed letter at the doorway. It had been stamped by no fewer than four of the Antonican bards who delivered out this way, a long journey for such a package and very expensive. As soon as Loral recognized the wax seal as that of Yeolarn Bronzeleaf the High Priest of Tunare, he opened it at once.</p>

      
        <p>My Dear Loral,</p>

        <p>It is with saddened heart that I give you the following news. A great horror has befallen our people and our Lady Tunare. An epic battle between the avatar of the Mother and the beast Cazic Thule took place a week ago. Our Lady has fallen and a plague of evil has taken over the lands of Lesser Faydark. Undead Sprites tear apart every living thing that resides within and even the Lady Fironia Vie's advisor, Quellimaine, has been perverted into serving the Beast.</p>

        <p>At this very moment the council of the Sword and the Church of Tunare are in session to determine a course of action.</p>

        <p>Because of these dark times the council of Felwithe is unable to provide aid to the noble Coldain in their war with the Kromrif.</p>

        <p>I know this comes as a great disappointment to you. For that I am sorry my friend.</p>

        <p>I wish you and your friends well and may the Mother watch over us all.</p>

        <p>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf</p>

        <p>High Priest of Tunare</p>
      

      <p>Loral dropped the note to the floor and wept.</p>

      <p>For months Loral had assisted in the raiding parties and spy teams gathering information and hindering the progression of the Kromrif armies. Loral's reputation with the Coldain had gone from suspicion and mistrust into respect and admiration over the months. When Loral returned to the council of Thurgadin with the news that the Kromrif would be invading within a week, the Dain put every able bodied dwarf under the command of his field general and top officers. They immediately began preparation for the battle to come, a far cry from the political meetings of the Felwithe council that usually lasted for weeks. The Dain was saddened to hear of the lack of Fier'dal support but took Loral's personal attendance and offer to assist as a sign of good faith if not for the High Elves than of himself.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>For three days and nights Loral sat in the cold damp caverns of the Greater Divide and battled the Kromrif. A short distance to the north was the waterfall entrance to Thurgadin, protected by the army of the mightest Coldain warriors. A fellow member of Healers United, the Lady Catlin, sent reports of their battles and of the progression of the Kromrif army. Only a short distance away Loral's group, a mix of the most powerful mercenaries and adventurers from all over Norrath, drew small groups of the Kromrif warriors and veterans out and awy from Thurgadin, slowly but surely thinning out their numbers. For three days they fought, filling the snow and the stream with the blood of giants. On the evening of the third day, Loral was healing the wounds of the scouts when he came across the mighty Shadowknight, Ggan the Reaver. The scarred troll wore an entire suit of bone armor and carried a black pulsing blade. Though no one was very comfortable sitting next to the dark knight, Loral found him more disturbing than most but couldn't understand exactly why. Upon noticing Loral's stare, Ggan grinned bearing great fangs and deepening the scar that cut through his face. Loral hurried past.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>A few minutes later it was announced that Narandi the Wretched himself had joined his troops in battle. Defeating him would send the Kromrif armies into disarray and Thurgadin would be safe. The scouts were quickly sent out to draw him away from the armies and to the caverns where the adventurers ambush awaited. Enraged by the though that so few had killed so many giants, Narandi took the bait and rushed quickly into the trap. The enchanted blades of a dozen warriors cut in at him while powerful spells unleashed the elements. Narandi's great sword, carved from teh bones of an ancient wyrm, cut down the warriors one after another. No prayer of healing cold protect them in time. The clerics quickly abandoned healing the warriors and instead began resurrecting them as soon as they had been killed. Fallen warriors shook off the chill of death, picked ub their weapons and continued the battle with Narandi the Wretched. The blades of the risen warriors began to cut deep into Narandi's thick hide, sending him into a rage. Great waves of flame poured over the giant and with one last howl, the lord of the Kromrif invasion was destroyed.</p>

      <p>The familiar crash of the tavern's front window woke Loral with a start. Loral sighed and stretched out feeling his back crack. Many windows had been installed and broken since the Kromrif army had been routed and their field commander slain. One happy dwarf even had the honor of being thrown through it by the hero of the outlanders, a rogue of all people, after a particularly crass remark about intimate relations with a tree. Loral noticed another package at his door, this one larger and stamped with the seal of his mentor, Ciric Azilebane. Inside Loral found a small book, handwritten under Ciric's pen, entitled "A Guide to the Claws of Veeshan". Lorla spent two days in his small hut studying the words within the book. Loral might have found the ally he needed after all. The most powerful ally in all of Norrath.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 17: The Claws of Veeshan</h2>
  
<p>No creature is as feared and admired as the mighty dragon. While the younger races of Norrath battle for lands, titles and treasure, the dragonkin have evolved as slowly as a mountain. Their power and their wisdom is the greatest known on Norrath. The following theories are taken from the loose scriptures of ancient texts. Our people have only just begun to understand the true power of these mighty beasts and it will be centuries before we stand a hope of truly discovering their mysteries. Our greatest hope is that we may one day stand side by side with the scaled children of Veeshan.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>During the first days of Norrath, there was nothing. An entire world had been created capable of sustaining all life but it stood naked. The greatest of the Gods, the crystalline dragon Veeshan, swooped down from the plane of Sky and tore open the lands of Velious with one mighty swoop. She deposited upon the land the first of all races, her children, the dragons. For a millenia they ruled all of Norrath. Their mighty wings beat through the air, their great wisdom and intellect studied the mysteries of the land. They built great monuments to their goddess. They built a society of honor and justice. Thus began the Age of Scale.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Soon after, the other gods began populating Norrath. The mortal races were born, grew up, fought and died all in the blink of an eye to the dragonkin. The dragons evolved like Norrath itself, their children coming only within centuries and living thousands of years. While the other races scrambled to survive from the dangers of the worlds and from each other, the dragons spent their time learning what powers and wisdom the earth held. Then the races met. The younger children of Norrath fled in fear from the mighty dragonkind, spreading rumors of hate and murder.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>It became known to the dragonkin that though they were much more powerful and wiser than the younger races, that their small numbers put them in danger. Two factions of the mighty dragons split apart. One, the Ring of Scale moved to the towering mountains of Veeshan's Peaks. The other stayed within the icy claws of Velious, isolated from the rest of Norrath.</p>

      <p>The Ring of Scale began getting involved in the interactions between the younger races. The betrothed dragons, Lord Nagafin and Lady Vox built lairs within the lands of Antonica and sent out their goblin and giant armies upon the world. They were the first to have contact with the younger races who spent years hunting them down.</p>

      <p>In the tropical lands of Kunark, the Ring of Scale sent forth a race of scaled humanoids, the Sarnak, to do their bidding. Along with the Sarnak, four dragons were sent out from the Peaks into the lands. The mightest of these four, the dragon Trakanon, had his spirit ripped from him by the earliest and most powerful necromancy. He took vengeance upon those who stole his life and ruled from within the ruins of their mightiest city. Another of them, the red wyrm, Talendar, stood guard outside the gates of Veeshan's Peaks. The other two, Gorinare and Solandar, wandered the lands learning what they could and sending back information of the races progress within the land. Within the Peaks, the mightiest of the Ring of Scale still commanded their agents and legions of troops within the societies of Norrath.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Back in their home of Velious, the Claws of Veeshan led by their mightiest, Vulak'Aerr, began construction of the Temple of Veehsan deep within the Western Wastes. Here they build the halls of testing, a place where mortals could be tested in order to prove their worth in the aid of the Dragonkin. The hall also became their place of worship to the goddess Veeshan and their place of work, unleashing the mightiest artifacts and spells ever known on Norrath. One such spell even unlocked a doorway to the Plane of Mischief, home of the insane god BristleBane. The protection of the temple itself was entrusted to Sontalak, a great wyrm known for his might and ability to sniff out the smallest attempt of deception. For centuries the children of Veeshan lived in peace. Many of the dragons wandered the Western Wastes, filling the breeding grounds with eggs that took centuries to hatch. The isolation of the land afforded them a protection even their own magic couldn't provide.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>As the mortals grew stronger, reports of their expansion into the lands of Velious grew. Knowing that they could not remain isolated forever, the leaders of the Claws built a great city and entrusted its well being to one of their children, the dragon Yelinak. His minions, including great wyverns, wurms, drakes and their creations, guarded the city and established a level of commerce with the outside world. Though separated by the mighty giant city, Kael Drakkal, the Coldain dwarves and the city of Skyshrine shared a mutually beneficial trade for stone and metal. Deep within the city, Yelinak and his closest advisors continued to research the powers of Norrath. The city served well as a layer of isolation for the Claws of Veeshan and their home within the Western Wastes.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>For a millenia the oldest of the Claws had kept a dark secret from even the younger members of their brood. Apparently the Claws had known of a great power, one darker and more powerful than any ever discovered. It was a power that could threaten the lands of Norrath itself if unleashed. Little was ever known about this power except that it was locked away inside of a tomb centuries before the dragonkin migrated to the Western Wastes. The tomb was sealed by the power of the mightest dragons, the Dar Brood, and sealed inside were the most powerful dragons ever to have lived. These dragons, the Warders, sacrificed their lives to help keep the danger locked from the rest of the world. To die for one's cause is considered noble. To be locked inside of a dark pit for an eternity is something above honor. This great danger was only known as the Sleeper.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>As the mortals began to migrate into the lands of Vellious, some of the dragonkin felt that the sacrifice of the Ring of Scale was not enough to protect them, they felt that only a clensing of the planet could keep the children protected. One of these spoke louder than all the others. Zlandicar the Black felt that unleashing the Sleeper would wipe clean the planet from the menace that would surly come inside of their homes. Zlandicar had felt loss at the hands of the mortals and took a far stronger view than many of the others. One of the high council, a great and wise wyrm known as Jaled Dar attempted to calm Zlandicar and spoke against his theories but to no avail. In a horrible event that shook the very structure of the Claws of Veehsan, Zlandicar killed Jaled Dar and was outcast deep within a dark land known as Dragon Necropolis. There he would reside among the carrion that fed on the dead wyrms of old. But recently, rumors have heard a voice, that of the ghost of Jaled Dar whispering of revenge in their minds. Though nothing more than a spirit, it plots to destroy Zlandicar by using his own weapon against him.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>These days the dragons have begun to recruit mortals into their fold, offering artifacts of power greater than any ever held by mortal in return for service against those who would hunt them down like dogs. They continue to research the most powerful lore ever known and share pieces of it with those they deem worthy. Their testing halls stand open to those who believe they have the strength to endure some of the greatest wrath ever felt. Those that survive are given great treasures those that don't are offered the void.</p>

      <p>There is no creature on Norrath that is as mysterious as the mighty dragons. While once thought to be a scourge upon the lands and a menace to her people, history shows that these creatures have as rich a culture and as wise a mind as any society that has ever lived. It would be one of the greatest adventures for any people to gain their trust and open up the wealth of knowledge and resources that this noble tribe has to offer. To turn our backs, or worse yet our blades, upon these mighty beings is to throw our mightiest books, spells and weapons into the fires of Hate. To side against the dragonkin is to side against Norrath herself for they are the first children to walk upon the earth. Any that seek a union with the noble children of Veehsan would see the smiles of the Gods upon them.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 18: Hsagra's Wrath</h2>
  
<p>Ice as hard as stone cracked open as the claw of the mighty dragon tore into the ground. The huge creature thundered across the icy planes as her pursuers closed in. Hsagra, sorceress of Veeshan and first brood of the dragons of Norrath, whirled around and unleashed a wide column of fire. Ice turned into steam burning those around it, but the Kromzek soldier who caught the blast was instantly vaporized. Hsagra's wings beat at the air as she once again fled from the small army of giants that chased her through the ice. While she had killed dozens of them upon their initial attack, with wings torn, and scales pierced she knew the peril of frontal combat. She stormed up a small hill and dug her claws into a large rock that jutted out of the ice. Whirling she began chanting her mightiest incantation and another flaming column disintegrated one of her perusers, this time a Kromzek captain. The small victory gave her hope that she could reach the Temple and gain the assistance of Sontalak, the guardian. She began her descent down the opposite side of the hill when Porlos' trap sprung. Her claw sunk into the snow and the wood and steel jaws of an enormous trap crushed her leg. Howling with pain, Hsagra fell to her side and saw the line of giants flanking her. In the middle of them was the sorcerer-king, Porlos, his red flowing cape billowing in the icy winds against his golden armor. The spearmen that accompanied him rushed in and stabbed at Hsagra's underbelly. Porlos' began chanting and a whirlwind of frost colder than any known in nature burned and cracked her scales wide open. Hsagra shrieked and fell back, gasping for one last breath. Instead of air, her lungs only felt the stab of Leutenant Derakor's blade as he stabbed through her into the ice below.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Deep under the ground of the dragon city of Skyshrine, Yelinak wailed as he watched the giants behead his wingmate through his murky scrying pool. He felt his sanity slipping further as they stripped the scales from her carcass and King Porlos broke free one of her large teeth. Yelinak and Hsagra had known a love for each other that had lasted longer than many empires of Norrath. They had grown up over centuries within the comfort of eachother. Now he was alone, with only the icy cavern around him to protect him from the world. He begged Veeshan to wake him from this horrible nightmare and when no dawn came he silently prayed for the Sleeper to be unleashed and finish his misery. Knowing that his oath to the Claws of Veeshan forbade any such action, he hung onto the only thing he could. Revenge.</p>

      <p>Loral's finger slid across the gash in the rock that Hsagra's giant claw had torn into it over five thousand years past. Though the winds had softened the gash, it was still very pronounced against the smooth stone. Loral turned to his party and followed their eyes to the line of giants below. A captain of the Kromzek force was bellowing orders to the troop, preparing them for the scouting mission against the dragon nursery. The excitement of the troop gave Loral the idea that they would do more than gather information should they come across a younger, weaker wyrm. The ranger to Loral's right whispered a prayer to the Mother and vanished. His steps could be seen in the thin powdered snow that covered the ice below as he approached the line of giants.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Seconds later, both the ranger and Loral fled to the caverns nearby, hoping to lose the giants that fast approached. While they had succeeded in dulling the minds of many of the troop, Loral's friend, Coelin, had been killed by the captain when he noticed the wood elf whispering soothing sounds to his men. Now the captain and one of his guard were almost upon the two remaining adventurers when they disappeared into a small cave. The captain stormed up to the cave but instead of finding the two elves within, he found the glowing blade of Ggan, the shadowknight. With one mighty cut, the Captain was hobbled to the ground. Spells and weapons of the mightiest adventurers quickly dispatched the captain and his guard.</p>

      <p>An hour later, Loral had given the scout Charisa, an agent of the Claws, the broken artifact he found on the captain. She smiled and handed Loral a talisman of the Claws, a globe with a tiny flame inside enclosed in a golden cage. Loral took the talisman and tied it to his belt. He and his friends bowed to Charisa and left for the warm beds of Thurgadin.</p>

      <p>After weeks spent in the libraries of Skyshrine and consulting with the wurm spellcasters of Yelinak's guard, Azile the Sorceress learned much of the ancient spells of the Claws of Veeshan. She listened to the tale of Hsagra's doom and of Yelinak's seclusion. She learned that once, another great dragon spellcaster, Relnar had constructed the lost spells of Hsagra. After days of travel through the icy winds of Western Wastes, far from the warm climate of Odus, Azile traveled to the great scar of Velious that acted as the doorway to the temple of Veeshan. Outside stood seven great wyrms, each with the power to destroy an entire city. Four of these were of Relnar's brood and having heard of her interests in the dragon's favor, they nodded their great heads as she confronted them. Great clouds of vapor left their nostrils as she recited what she had learned. They spoke with her of the powerful spells of Hsagra and gave her four runes, artifacts of Relnar's teachings in return for her vow to assist them in their war with the giants. A week later she was back in Skyshrine, meeting with Lawla, the scribe of Skyshrine to put together the lore she had gathered.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral was having a friendly chat with the barkeep in the Coldain miner's bar of Thurgadin when Azile drifted silently through the door. Loral stood and embraced the Erudite who looked pale compared with her normal ebony complexion. They picked out a small table for two and Loral poured Azile a small glass of Winterfalls Wine, a specialty of the establishment, and a drink Loral fancied when he couldn't drink a glass of Tunare's Finest from his home town of Felwithe. She pushed the glass away and stared coldly at Loral.</p>

      <p>"I have it, my friend. The magic of the dragon sorcerers is mine. Soon, the giants of Kael will feel Hsagra's wrath."</p>

      <p>Loral shivered a bit at this thought. While they had discussed their plans in the war with the Kromrif and Kromzek of Kael Drakkal, a small voice in the back of Loral's mind wailed softly. Loral quickly shook the voice away and stared across at his old friend and protector.</p>

      <p>"Than feel it they shall."</p>

      
        
      

      <p>For a thousand years it had stood and guarded. It had lived through three different kings and hundreds of political disputes that ended in blood. Five hundred of the mightiest warriors of Kael had died in the arena under his reign as the sole guardian of Zek. He was the only surviver of the reign of Porlos the Sorcerer-king. While King Tormax knew his legacy and his power, he never made a move against the guardian, knowing that to do so was to risk the wrath of Zek and possibly his own death. Derakor the Vindicator cared not for politics or squabbling. It did not care of the war with the Coldain, a topic though hundreds of years old felt like a drop in the bucket to the veneral Vindicator. Derakor felt no fear or pain or love. He felt only duty. He had but one job, protect the Temple of Zek. He and the guardians that served him had the simplest of orders. Defend or die. Recently, however, the voice of Rallos Zek gave him new orders. He was to once again serve in battle for the God of War. He must lead an assault against the Plane of Growth and defeat Tunare, herself.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 19: The Test</h2>
  
<p>Loral remembered vividly the day his neighbors brought him to the church of Tunare and introduced him to Yeolaren. He and his father had often gone to the ceremonies that Yeolaren preceded over which had always intrigued the young lad. That day he felt nothing. The night before, while the rest of Felwithe slept, a demon came from the pits of Hate and stole his father away in their own house. Standing there on the cold marble floors of the church, facing the silver armored high priest of Tunare, Loral had never felt so alone in the world. Loral felt that exact same way when he stood deep in the Temple of Veeshan buried under millions of tons of rock and ice and looked into the large yellow eyes of Lendiniara the Keeper.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Two ancient white wurms and two smaller red drakes flanked the Keeper. Each one of these guardians held enough power to burn Felwithe to the ground in a matter of minutes but they were dwarfed in size and in power by Lendiniara. The ancient dragon of the western halls stood fourteen meters tall and more than fifty meters from tale to horn. Great winds blew Loral's green robes against him as Lendiniara stretched her great wings and quickly retracted them back to her sides. The fast movement of such a large creature seemed wholly impossible and Loral found his mind had trouble grasping what he had just seen.</p>

      <p>Images and words poured through Loral's head in a flood that soon relaxed as Lendiniara found the level of communication that Loral's mind was capable of handling. Loral saw a black stone doorway to the east of the ancient temple. Behind there, Lendiniara explained, Loral would be tested. He should expect to be tested in mind, body and spirit, the internal voice of Lendiniara continued, the testing halls had forged the mightiest warriors, priests and spellcasters that had ever dared to walk in front of the dragonkin, but most found only death or insanity.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>As Loral walked slowly to the main halls of the Temple of Veeshan, past the wurms and drakes that had been guarding the halls since before the Elven nations had crossed the Ocean of Tears, he tried to remind himself what was at stake. Meeting the Coldain dwarves had shown Loral the tyranny of the giant nations of Kael Drakkal and luckily had revealed their plot against the Plane of Growth. Knowing of the long-standing wars between the giants and the dragons, Loral had hoped to seek their wisdom and strength to help him protect Tunare and her children. Loral's greatest wish would be to see a formal alliance between the Claws of Veeshan, guardians of this temple, and the Guardians of Tunare within the Plane of Growth. The combined power would be enough to defeat the giants for good and perhaps bring peace to many of Norrath's people. As Tunare's hand on Norrath, it would be Loral's greatest accomplishment to be the vehicle for this alliance. Perhaps then the pain of his actions would be removed.</p>

      <p>These thoughts left Loral's mind completely when he faced the black stone doorway that led to the Halls of Testing. Loral couldn't imagine what led past that door. Memories of Innoruuk's tug on his spirit and Trakanon's lifetime of solitude flowed past as he looked towards the ancient standard of the Claws imprinted on the door. For another few moments Loral stared at the symbol, then he placed his hand on the door and entered.</p>

      <p>A blast of hot air and smoke blew past Loral as he stepped into the halls of testing. The smell of sulfur burned his nose and the screams of claws scraping on stone sent chills up and down his back. Loral was in the center of a large U shaped room. The stone floors and walls had been blown smooth over thousands of years of erosion. Two stone staircases on either side led down to a large sunken room with three doors. Large gusts of hot wind blew against Loral, but one sight pushed him harder than any physical blast. Standing at the top of the south staircase was Sever Doomreaper.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral was very familiar with Sever's reputation and had even seen the shadowknight compete in a barbaric contest in the Arena in South Antonica. Sever was a mercenary of Innoruuk, offering his services to a variety of groups against a variety of foes for a variety of prices. His power both as a swordsman and as a practitioner of the dark arts were known to every regular drunk in every bar of Norrath. Loral had no doubt that these tales were true. Held loosely in one hand, blade pointed into the ground was Sever's blade, Innoruuk's Curse, a gift by the dark god for only his most faithful and powerful followers. Blackened armor covered in runes adorned his slender frame. Tucked under his arm was the mask of a demon, it's appearance alone a thing of nightmares. Seeing Loral's discomfort, Sever smiled.</p>

      <p>Loral was baffled by the confrontation. While he had no doubt in his faith to Tunare or the powers bestowed upon him, Loral also knew there was no way he would be able to defeat the dark knight. As if in answer to this thought, the voice of Lendiniara once again filled his mind.</p>

      <p>"All who choose to walk our halls are tested equally here. You, a cleric of light and this one a minion of darkness are two halves of a whole. Only while acting as one will you survive the tests"</p>

      <p>All became clear to Loral. Though the thought of such an alliance still disturbed him, he must work with Sever in order to defeat whatever beasts roamed these halls. Loral would have to use the powers of Tunare to heal a weapon of Innoruuk. Loral was aware that he and Sever were not alone. All around them, adventurers from all over Norrath stood and prepared to be tested. Before Loral could finish the thought, one of the three great doors opened and out stormed the first of hundreds of ancient guardian wurms that Loral would face with his new allies over the coming weeks. Loral placed his hand over the warden symbol of Tunare around his neck and whispered a prayer just as the first wave of fire hit the party.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Two moons later, Loral stepped out of the tower that separated the dragon city of Skyshrine from the gulf of the Cobalt Scar. His dark blue/green armor, forged and enchanted by the powerful Leoch sorcerers of the Claws, reflected the water in the gulf below. Though the battles had been more difficult than he could describe, Loral had gained much from the dragons during the testing. The trials had made enemies of friends and friends of enemies. He had found protection where he least expected and where he once had found solid ground had now become a vacuum. Loral had learned a valuable lesson, a lesson he had heard many times from his mentor Ciric but never fully understood until these recent battles. There was a great balance in the worlds of Norrath. A great balance that Loral must learn to utilize rather than to fight. Only by working within this balance could Loral hope to protect his friends and his God. It was a lesson that changed Loral forever.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 20: Vindication</h2>
  

        
      

      <p>A warm breeze glided through the quiet tree limbs, rustling leaves and sending a wave through the tall grass of the grove. Loral sat at the top of a small hill looking down at the wonders that only the presence of the Mother could create. Four tall white unicorns gently grazed upon the thick grass. Their wise and patient eyes beheld Loral as they chewed and for a moment all of Loral's past troubles left him. For a second he felt the true beauty of this place. He placed his hand on the earth below him and felt the energy of life that spread out from the tower, gateway to the Plane of Growth a short distance away. The energy spread through him and he exhaled feeling his tention flow out through him. Loral hadn't felt such peace in years. The sights, the sounds, the feelings, all blended together into one perfect experience.</p>

      <p>The far away clash of metal against metal brought him out of his trance and he remembered why he was here. A short few kelometers away, the Frost Giant war machine was in full production, preparing for a war with the minions of the Plane of Growth. Loral had scouted the area a few days earlier and had seen the enormous structures and great outposts that were being built. He knew that action had to come soon if the war was to be stopped.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>A half hour later, Loral stood outside of the eastern doorway to Kael Drakkal. Two guards stood outside the great stone cavern, their large weapons resting against the walls. Loral's thoughts turned around his plan for defeating the enormous foes, no easy task by himself, when he noticed a number of scarlet lines down the neck of one of the guards and a large dark puddle around it's feet. Taking out his gnomish scryer, he zoomed in on the giant's and saw the source of those trails. Dozens of arrows had the giant pinned to the wall behind him, it's lifeblood spilt to the ground below. Knowing the carefully planned deception would not last long, Loral hurried into the city.</p>

      <p>There was a great commotion just inside the city gates. Adventurers from all the great cities in Norrath stood ready, donned in the most spectacular armor and brandishing the greatest weapons in Norrath's history. Though the races of the hunters ranged from tiny gnomes to huge orgres, they all shared a symbol of a white flower upon their breasts. Loral recognized the symbol for the Cult of the Lotus, a powerful guild of hunters. Loral had battled beside them when their paths had crossed before and knew their great strength in such matters. The skill with which the giant guards had been slain was no longer a surprise to him.</p>

      <p>As Loral passed through them, he spotted Azile, dressed in the red robes of the Icicle, talking to a sharp eyed gnome mage. Azile turned and smiled at Loral. Loral suddenly felt the sting of a blade jabbed into his side. Turning quickly he beheld the slender figure and wide smile of Aleustria the Ranger. With a shout of excitement he embraced his old friend having not seen her since their travels in the lands of Kunark many seasons earlier. From the incredibly fine chain armor and the glowing blades in her hands, it was obvious that life had been good for her since joining the Cult. Before they could spend any more time reminiscing. The attack began.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral had never witnessed such an attack. Giants were confronted and slaughtered before he had time to speak one prayer. Kromrif guards burst into ash from the powerful spells of the great wizards. Within minutes, the team stood outside the northern arena of Kael, lair of the great Clerics of Zek and pathway to the Church of the war god. With little delay the clerics that had caused Loral such concern were dragged out into the courtyard and cut down. They were of little concern to the Lotus Cult who had only two targets in mind for this attack.</p>

      <p>An agile monk of the party, known for his ability to draw out attackers from any position using many arts of deception ran to the north down a long icy bridge. The warriors stood ready, their healers behind them prepared to heal the great wounds they would soon face. Seconds later the monk returned and on his heel was the sole guardian of Zek himself, Derekor the Vindicator.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Three weeks later, Loral was back in Felwithe in the chambers of his teacher, Yeloaren. Loral described the fall of not only the priests of Zek and even the mighty Vindicator, but also of the very king of Kael himself, King Vlantious Tormax. The Vindicator was only half of the goal of Lotus Cult that day, Loral explained. In one single attack, the entire political structure of Kael from both the religious sect and the royal court had fallen. Thurgadin was safe and the war against Growth had been quickly forgotten.</p>

      <p>"This is a great victory, my friend. It is these selfless actions you have taken that has led to this day. Tunare has smiled upon you and upon us all. It is your action in these matters that has led the Church and the Court of Felwithe to ask once again for your service in another matter." Yeolaren spoke carefully, Loral noticed. "The wizard Al'Kabor has released a gateway to the moon of Luclin. As we speak, agents of all known empires are traveling to these unknown lands. The Court is concerned with what may be found up there and what may find us should it choose to travel back down. We need those faithful to the Church to learn more of these lands. Your skills in the matters of Velious show you to be the perfect choice."</p>

      <p>Loral knew there was more not being said. While his victory in defending the Plane of Growth was not in doubt, his past actions had placed them in an uncomfortable situation. The Court of Felwithe was never comfortable with his alliance with the Claws of Veeshan and the Church of Tunare had not forgotten the death of Idoru and his fall into the hands of Innoruuk. Sending him so far away was a perfect situation for them. They stood much to gain from the new world and little to lose should he fail.</p>

      <p>Loral quickly dismissed much of these thoughts when he remembered his reason for being here. Had Felwith thought so little of him there is no way they would give him the gift he was about to receive. Should he still be dark to Tunare's eye, She would simply not allow it. He took in a deep breath to reduce his nervousness as he and Yeloaren walked down into the main halls of the Church of Felwithe. Together they stood at the large oak doors that lead to the first church of Tunare. Yeloaren put a hand on his shoulder, as he had done decades earlier when Loral first swore his oath to Tunare and became an acolite in her service. The door opened and at the head of the church stood the council of the Church, the chancellor of the Court of Paladins and King Tearis Thex himself. Loral stood straight and prepared himself to swear his oath again, this time as a High Priest of Tunare.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Cold ice blew against the cliff that overlooked Cobalt Scar. On a large rock nearby, the sorceress Azile mediated. Loral, holding his cloaks tight against him from the chilling wind, climbed the rock and sat next to her. She wore a golden robe this day, adorned with the symbol of a white lotus. Though somewhat concerned by the unknown motives of the Cult of the Lotus, Loral was still happy for Azile's acceptance into the selective group. Likewise, Azile smiled when she saw the symbol of a High Priest of Tunare that hung around Loral's neck next to the tooth of Trakanon. The brightness of the moon of Luclin above them seemed to grab their attention at the same time and they both turned to gaze upon it.</p>

      <p>"The world will never be the same now," Azile said coldly. "Who knows what evils that meddling megalomaniac Al'Kabor has done to us."</p>

      <p>Even with her distaste for the well known wizard, Loral could feel her excitment of exploring whatever wonders were unveiled within that alien land. In a few short days, they would travel to the Nexus for the first time, and as Azile had stated, the world would never be the same.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 21: The Shadows of Luclin</h2>
  
<p>Bonescar was happy with his new life. Ever since his escape from the Runnyeye goblin's gladiator with the help of his new employer, Loral Ciriclight the priest, he had nothing but good drink, hearty food and extra coin for his purse. Loral taught the large barbarian the trade of the merchant, a long way from his original trade as a future corpse of the cheering bloodthirsty goblins. He now had a keen eye for what was truly a mighty weapon of ancient times and what was better used to poke a rat. He served his master well and in turn had begun to build a life for himself. But that night it all ended with a dark blade stabbing him through his back.</p>

      <p>The dark elf pulled the blade free and wiped the blood on the wolf cloak still held in the barbarian's arms. Quickly he cut free the man's purse, only to toss it down a deep crack in the wall. He had no use for the dead man's possessions, save for one item. Within seconds, he found the heavy object. The icy eyes of the assassin gleamed when he saw how successful this hunt had been. The sounds of footsteps and the red-purple glow of torchlight brought him back to the moment. Stepping back into the shadows, he disappeared from sight.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral Ciriclight stood at the center of the ancient spires. He watched the Nexus Scion, a beautiful high elf dressed in the white apprentice robes of Al'Kabor's wizard school, her blue eyes fixed and focused. Loral felt the ground begin to rumble and a great humming filled his head, rattling his teeth and weakening his knees. White glowing clouds drifted from the ground around them and a white sphere began spinning around the large spires. Then with a flash, he was gone.</p>

      <p>The great forest of Greater Faydark was replaced with the dark stone rock of a large cavern. Loral and the other travelers stood on a large platform surrounded by four spires just like those he had left. The platform sat upon a huge black rock chipped in thousands of places and vibrating with a huge internal power. Four stairways led down the great rock and into caverns beyond and to the nearby city of Shadowhaven. There was no doubt, Loral was far from home.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>For his short stay in Shadowhaven, Loral discovered the general disdain the residents had for 'outlanders'. Loral spent little of his time talking and much of it listening to the rumors of workers and nobles in Shadowhaven's inns. He heard tales of the caverns that led to the surface and after replenishing his supplies and donning the blue armor of the dragonkin, he crossed the great bridge of the underground city and into the dark caverns of Paludal.</p>

      <p>Loral spent two days slowly navigating through the dense Paludal Caverns. Just outside of the gates of shadowhaven, bandits and thieves had set up a small and run-down village held at bay by the sharp blades of the powerful Shadowhaven guard. The caverns evolved into large worn stone, blasted away by the currents of large underground rivers. Great shelled beasts and small humanoids with skin of thick fungus glared at his passing but did not attack, though their smell alone was almost enough to fell the cleric. Soon the caverns opened up and Loral stepped carefully outside onto the beach that circled Hollowshade Moore.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The site was one of the most beautiful Loral had ever seen. Waves of a crystal clear lake gently washed upon the pure white sand of the beach. The very sound of the water soothed the ache of the caverns behind him. Green hills stretched beyond the beach to the west and far off he could see the lights and smoke of torchlight and campfires. That is when the light above caught his attention and he looked up to view the huge sphere of Norrath.</p>

      <p>Loral lost his balance and would have slipped into the water below if he hadn't steadied himself on the wall. The feeling of hanging upside down above his homelands was so strong it took the strength from him. Feeling suffocated, Loral pulled off his helmet and dropped it to the ground. No site he had seen upon this moon truly made him understand his position until he stood staring at the very lands he had lived on thousands of miles above him.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Returning to his present situation, he hoped to find shelter among those camps ahead. Thinking it a perfect opportunity to try his latest possession, a gift of the lady Dahlea and the priestess Wrenne, he drew the white bridal, clasped with the symbol of Tunare, out from his soft leather pack and held it at arms length. He closed his eyes and remembered the words of activation.</p>

      <p>"Come Illumina"</p>

      <p>An unearthly air spun around Loral and his arms and a great white mare stepped from the swirling grey mist. It's head filled the muzzle of the bridle and in seconds, Loral found himself next to the beautiful creature. The great beast stood with the nobility that only a creature of Tunare could have. Loral stood in awe. Almost impatiently, the horse turned and nudged Loral with its muzzle. Loral smiled, mounted the beautiful horse and the two sped off to the firelight ahead.</p>

      <p>Little did he know of the murder of his friend, and little did he know of the dangers to follow.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 22: The Spire Lord</h2>
  
<p>Chilled air blew through the deep caverns as Loral and his friends stepped out of the mouth of the cave that led to the barren plains of Marus Seru. Ahead of them, great ridges fed into canyons hundreds of meters deep. Quivous, the armored bard, stepped forward and Loral followed close. Behind Loral were Juror, Wrenne and Raom. Each highly respected elders of Healers United and mighty adventurers.</p>

      <p>Quivous's magical songs of travel held the party high above the great gorges of the broken land. A misstep climbing the steep ridges would mean death, but floating high above them, the party was safe. Looking down, Loral could make out the giant blue isects that crawled within the gorge. Loral shivered as his feet stepped upon illusionary walkways while they traveled deeper into the barren land.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Climbing over a steep ridge, the party beheld the great broken artifact. A huge stone platform stood on giant arcing columns of granite that burrowed deep into the rock like great worms. The platform stood hundreds of meters above the earth and was penetrated through the center by the spike of a steep mountain peak. At each corner was a grey runed spire the same proportions of the wizard spires of Norrath but much larger. One of the four had broken and lay deep in the canyon below, shattered from the great fall.</p>

      <p>Loral had learned of the existence of this monument through gossip and rumor. Though many of the drunkards of various inns had little information of worth, one elderly bar maiden told Loral a tale passed to her by her grandfather. According to her story, the great wizards of Seru, known as the Eye, attempted to construct the largest teleportation spire ever created, building it upon this mighty platform over a twenty year period. When finished, the great wizards of the Eye of Seru tore open the fabric of time and space to activate the great spires, but something went horribly wrong.</p>

      <p>The great energy of the spires collapsed and exploded, sending one of the burning spires plummeting to the canyon below. Some wizards were simply blown to pieces, others were transported to some unknown reaches of the universe damned to unknown hells. The deformed clawed hands of extra-planiar beasts reached from the abyss and tore others to shreds. Many powerful wizards had their spirits stripped free of their bodies, forever to walk in two planes of existance with life in neither. Hundreds of years later, the barmaiden told Loral, the spirits of the damned wizards still haunted the spires seeking answers and vengeance.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral pointed his traveling companions to the base of the canyon wall below the platform. There, a small cave led into the mountain that pierced into the platform. Blades drawn and spells ready, the party entered the cave. A few meters in the cave widened into a giant circular cavern. The center held a great pillar and spiral walkway leading far above the floor. All along the outskirts of the cavern stood spirits of the damned wizards, now guardians of the abomination.</p>

      <p>With great speed the party was engulfed under the blacked robed figures. Icy etherial claws tore at the party. The chilling touch of the horrors turned Raom's skin grey and Loral began his prayers to Tunare to cure his longtime friend. Back to back, the party made their way to the staircase in order to fight the spirits one at a time. Loral grasped the warden symbol of Tunare around his neck and the earth below reached up and held the spirits to the ground. Quivous's harmony lent great strength to the blades of himself and Raom while Juror's spiritual chants stole the speed from their attackers. Wrenne splayed her fingers and a blinding star of fire tore through one of the spectres, bursting it into flame.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Gaining the high ground, the party moved quickly up the staircase, paralyzing each creature in turn until they were able to focus on defeating the spirit. Raom's bladed axe, a Wurmslayer of Kunark, drove through the dusty robes and landed solidly in the etherial body of the spirits. Loral turned his hand from the spells of healing into the judgement of Tunare's wrath, blasting down another of the horrid spectres with unyielding energy. Soon the party had worked up the stairs to the upper platform but instead of a break in the onslaught the party faced even greater numbers.</p>

      <p>The eternal voices of torment filled the heads of the weary adventurers as the spirits attacked. Feeling the battle turning against them, Wrenne prepared to open a gateway far away to the lands of Norrath where they might escape with their lives. Quivous, quick to find solutions to such odds, began a different chant. This one a slow melody that turned the attentions of the spirits away from tearing the party to shreds. Their voices calmed as memories of their lives flowed into them through the haunting chant. Quickly capitalizing on the turn of battle, the rest of the adventures cut down the spirits with spell and blade. Soon they stood in the empty room, the tattered robes of their foes at their feet.</p>

      <p>The adventurers passed through an archway onto the open platform, facing the true guardian of the destroyed portal, the Spire Lord. It stood taller than any of the spectres they faced and instead of an eternal blackness staring out from under the dark hood, twin red eyes pierced into the very souls of those who met it's gaze. A steel crown, that of an arch-wizard of Seru, adorned the head of the century old creature. With an etherial growl, more felt than heard, the beast attacked.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Raom stunned the spectre with a quick slam of his shield and a powerful chant to his diety, Errolisi Marr. Juror cursed the creature, calling fourth the great powers of ancient mystics and stealing the lord's strength. Wrenne surrounded the party with translucent blades of energy that bit into the spiritual beast with each swing of it's horrible invisible claws. Quivous sung songs of war as he cut into the creature. Loral surrounded Raom with a celestial pool of light, healing his wounds as they appeared and protecting him from the cold touch of death. They fought in perfect sequence, each member an extension of the party in perfect unison. Though never having faced such a creature in battle, it was little match for the battle hardened Healers. With a final cut of Raom's blade, the spirit screamed across two planes of existence and fell to the platform's surface.</p>

      <p>Three weeks later, Wrenne met Loral on the second floor of a small inn near Shadowhaven. Loral had been preparing a report to the Church of Tunare outlining the events. Wrenne smiled at the strict scripture and Loral's attention to details, it would seem even the wilds of Luclin hadn't removed his sense of discipline in the matters of the church. They talked about what they had seen at length, it was clear that while they had seen first hand the results of Seru's attempt, the full result of the catastrophic event was unknown. Loral had heard of spectral minions of other planes walking within caverns under Luclin. Rumors of the return of the slavemasters of the Iksar had also been overheard. There were many great dangers on Luclin, and with the Nexus now in operation, those dangers could soon face Norrath. Loral had much yet to discover.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 23: Lady of the Heart</h2>
  
<p>It was the darkest day for the elves of Tunaria. For hundreds of years they had known a great prosperity and a great peace. The high elven city of Takish-Hiz was known across all of Norrath as a pillar of strength and honor. Outside, the wood elven glades of Eldarr Forest held the greatest wonders of nature, a true monument to Tunare. But the jealousy of a demi-god destroyed it all. Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince, twisted the spine of the lands, turning forest into desert and mountains to dust. The elves fought valiantly but poverty, plague and war broke their spirits. The great demon, Ixiblat Fur, killed thousands before the great wizards banished him back to the Plane of Fire. The elves watched as all they had known and loved turned to death and sadness. With the loss of hundreds of years of prosperity, they built ships of their remaining trees and sailed across the great blue sea, known years later as the ocean of tears.</p>

      <p>Loral sat in the sulfuric baking caverns of the late Lord Nagafen. Now assisting the priests of the Triumverate, Loral had tracked down the last of those who wished to once again release the demon-god, Solusek Ro. In a great battle, Loral prevented the release of Ixiblat Fur and broken the Sarnak circle of sorcerers who attempted his summoning. Now only a traveling merchant, Zordak Ragefire, remained. Loral had heard of the merchant's passing through these corridors, and traveled to the underground lair of the dragon, Nagafen, to confront the agent of Ro. A week earlier, Loral had infiltrated the compound of fire giants that protected the lair and now he camped in the cavern itself, surviving on the sustenance his powerful armor of the draconian priest, Akkirus, provided. The great gasses of the rivers of lava stung Loral's lungs and clouded his mind. He wondered if he would even have the strength to battle Ragefire, should the time come. For days he fell in and out of consciousness, dreaming of wonders and horrors alike.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Loral woke to the strange light glowing in the center of the cavern. His eyes had grown accustom to the red glow of this hall, so this new blue light grabbed his attention immediately. He sat up, reaching for his shield and grasping tight his warden symbol of Tunare. In the center of the room stood a figure, armored in violet and carrying twin blades sparkling with energy. She was a wood elf, shorter than Loral in stature but carrying herself with an air of authority and nobility Loral had never seen. Loral found it hard to breathe, and when she turned to behold him, he had no doubt of her divine nature. She was an angel of Tunare, the Lady of the Heart.  She called herself Zhia.</p>

      <p>Zhia smiled and sat with Loral for a short while, discussing the matters of Solusek Ro's plots as though she had witnessed the history herself.  Her voice was that of a perfectly tuned harp, it's sound soothing the aches of this place and clearing his clouded mind and spirit. For a short time she stayed with Loral, but eventually stood to leave. Before he could stammer out his thanks at the visit, she drew a small wrapped package from a belt pouch. Loral accepted the package and watched as she touched one of her jeweled rings and disappeared in a burst of energy. Loral opened the small package, smiled, and bit into one of the tasty gnome shaped cookies.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>It had been five years since Loral and his friends had broken Ragefire's ruse and defeated the hidden dragon. Loral had just returned to the forest of Greater Faydark after one of his adventures in Luclin to hear the announcement of a great contest of casters and priests to be held in the Arena. Loral never found much interest in these contests, but something drove him to travel far to the planes of the Karanas and to ride Illumina south to the great Arena of Antonica. During his ride, he tried to find the source of this drive. Was it simple curiosity, or some darker splinter from Innoruuk's previous hold on his spirit?</p>

      <p>A few days later, Loral found himself inside the great arena. Around him stood the mightiest priests and spellcasters Norrath had ever seen. Loral found a group of his friends from Lotus Cult and they quickly prepared to work together in the chaotic contest to follow. With some short instructions by the organizers of the great event, the gates slammed shut and the horns of battle sounded.</p>

      <p>The bolts of lightning and bursts of fire could be seen fifty miles away. The powers of the greatest casters tore open the fabric of space and time, bringing down hails of ice and tearing the ground open to swallow it's victims. Loral quickly ran for cover as tons of rock hurled itself through the air and waves of plague blew through the crowds. He stepped off of the central platform and moved towards one of the outside spires when what he beheld knocked him to his knees.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Walking casually through the crowd was the visage of the Burning Prince, Solusek Ro himself. The sounds of the explosions around him drifted away as a thousand years of history filled Loral's mind. He beheld the twenty foot avatar and remembered the stories his father had told him of the plight of the elves and the sorrow of leaving their great homeland of Tunaria. He remembered the cruelty of Ixiblat Fir burning the armies of noble paladins into ash. Loral gasped for words and stood on unstable legs as his anger built. Suddenly, Loral felt strong arms pull him aside as a column of fire burst from the ground where he had stood. Under one arm of the barbarian shaman, he was carried behind one of the great claw-like spires of the Arena as the battle raged around him.</p>

<p>The great battle raged around his party as they defended their small alcove.  The mighty Lotus Cultian wizards sent great shards of ice tearing through the arena while the healing powers of the shaman and druids closed gaping wounds and soothed charred skin.  Loral's mind was still clouded with the image of the burning prince.  Of all loral had expected at this barbaric display, he had no idea he would come face to face with the focal point for the end of the great elven nations.</p>
      
        
      
<p>The minutes stretched as long as days under the stress of the great battle.  Great horns had blown, signaling a final battle in the center of the arena.  Loral and his remaining partners moved quickly to the raised platform.  Loral could not find the avatar of Ro, but what he did see shocked him almost as much.  There, walking casually through the final strife of the great war, twin blades glimmering with a life all their own, was the Lady of the Heart.  Waves of fire rolled over her without even a blemish on her soft skin.  Her eyes flashed as bolts of lightning broke open the ground in front of her, though she didn't even blink.  Her green elven eyes turned and beheld Loral's pale blue.  His heart stopped and he fell to his knees in humility and reverence.  Zhia winked and smiled.</p>

<p>A week had passed.  Loral had traveled back to the lands of Luclin, far above Norrath, but each night he spent in the small room on the second-floor inn he thought of that day.  Many dangers Loral had heard rumors of during his travels, many possible threats to assess and deliver to the Church of Felwithe.  But that day, he had been driven to witness the calling of the dark god, Solusek Ro.  That day he had seen the angelic protector of the elves, as he had while hunting the agent of Ro, Ragefire.  What purpose for the event was still unexplained, but Loral would not take lightly what he had seen.  His eyes would be open for possible signs of further explanation.  And he could only hope and pray to see the vision of Zhia, Lady of the Heart, once again.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 24: A brief history of the Iksar</h2>
  
<p>Understanding a species requires an understanding of its history. This parchment discusses the main turning points of the great Iksar Empire, from her rise of imperial power to her fall into darkness.</p>

      <p>The Shissar</p>

      
        
      

      <p>No one knows where they came from or how long they were in power, but historians have no doubt that the great empire of the Shissar was powerful indeed. Quite possibly shaping much of Norrath's culture and planting the seeds of much that exists today. They were devastating and vile, torturing souls for no other reason than their own pleasure and driving the largest slave army ever built to the brink of death and starvation.</p>

      <p>Their monuments are rare, for the Shissar paid little homage to their god, Cazic Thule. Only two great stone hands protruding from the swamp of Innothule show their acknowledgment of the diety. As their power grew, so did their vanity. They renounced Cazic Thule and proclaimed themselves walking gods upon Norrath. They drove the Iksar slaves harder then ever and brought the lizard-people to the brink of extinction.</p>

      <p>Freedom of the Green Mist</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Then came the Green Mist. Unknown in origin, many believe it to be a plague engineered by the fiendish alchamists of Cazic Thule in his poisoned plane of Fear. A tool of revenge against his lost children, it was released upon Norrath seeking out the Shissar alone among the enormous slave population. The Shissar's whip wielding hands fell and soon the slave races found themselves without masters. The Shissar had been wiped off the face of Norrath forever and freedom was given to a race that had known nothing but torment.</p>

      <p>For many years the Iksar wandered Kunark, seeking shelter and food. They began to form small packs, which formed larger tribes. After six decades, these tribes numbered five - the Kunzar, the Obulus, the Jarsath, the Kylong and the Nathsar. Feuds and skirmishes between the five tribes tore much of Kunark apart. Some shaman of the Iksar tapped into the powers of their original master, the god Cazic Thule, and their power grew. Others began delving into the darker arts left behind by the Shissar and others practiced hand to hand combat as an art.</p>

      <p>Than one stepped outside of the tribes, stronger and smarter than all the others. He alone held the power to unite them, and unite them he did. The young warrior of the Kunzar, Venril Sathir, knew the key to uniting the tribes. He taught them patriotism. For only in the love of their species, the love of their society as Iksar united, would they be able to unite. And thus the empire was born.</p>

      <p>Emperor Venril Sathir</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Venril Sathir's empire grew quickly. Great monuments were built, embedding a great pride in all the Iksar and inspiring fear in all those who would oppose the huge empire. Cities of grand scale were built by the Iksar's goblin and giant slaves. Venril Sathir wed the eldest daughter of the Obulus wizards, Druzilla, and together they built the greatest empire ever known.</p>

      <p>But Sathir was not sated. Discovering a dark tome of necromancy, said to be one of the original texts left from the Shissar, Venril Sathir began a ritual to grant him immortality. Knowing of this dark corruption, Venril's eldest son, Rile Sathir, interrupted the dark ritual and destroyed the body of Venril Sathir, burying all evidence in the tomb of Charasis.</p>

      <p>Emperor Rile Sathir</p>

      <p>Soon after being crowned, Rile Sathir continued to open the Iksar nation to prosperity. While Venril used the honor of the Iksar as a weapon, Rile used the water. Under his command, a great navy was built, larger than any Norrath has ever seen since. Led by Rile's weaponsmaster, Vlzk Irontail, the navy knew no dangers and no bounds. The Iksar became the richest nation upon all of Norrath. Rile's land army was as formidable as his navy and he soon built a massive slave army of goblins and giants. Only one race was left unruled on Kunark - the dragons.</p>
      
        
		
      <p>The Ring of Scale, an ancient order of great dragons upon Kunark, understood the threat of this growing empire and their leader, Jaled Dar, acted upon it. They sent fourth an agent of Scale, one known for his viscousness and ruthless nature. While the Iksar empire was large, the great circle of wyrms knew only one agent would be required. Swooping out of the great caverns of Veeshan's Peaks flew the powerful green dragon, Trakanon.</p>

      <p>It was said that a great storm destroyed the armada of Rile Sathir, but other historians know differently. Standing from the bow of his greatest warship, Rile pondered the strange messages his network of sages had given him, feelings of terror and confusion from the other ships of his armada. He looked out over the great sea into the vast waves of the storm around him. In the distance, a great wave traveled in the wrong direction and at its crest flew the enormous Trakanon. Giant arrows the size of trees were fired from the ballista of Rile's ship, tearing through the leathery wings of the huge beast. Trakanon flew only a few feet above the ship and crashed down onto Rile's sister ship, breaking the hull in half with its great claws. Balls of fire and storms of electricity raked over the dragon but Trakanon was relentless. He turned and breathed a great cloud of acidic gas upon the ship's deck, killing scores of the crew instantly.</p>

      <p>Rile watched as his weaponsmaster, Vlzk Irontail, leapt onto the back of the powerful wyrm and crushed the beast's ribs with a great swing of his steel tail. Twisting too fast to see, Trakanon plucked off the heroic Iksar and bit him in half. With the grin of a thousand teeth, Trakanon leapt onto Rile's own ship and faced the soon-dead emperor of the Iksar.</p>

      <p>The battle was quick but its scale enormous. In the great battle, Rile Sathir's armada was sunk and Rile himself was lost at sea. While single handedly destroying the largest navy of Norrath's history, Trakanon himself was mortally wounded and crawled into a deep cave to prepare to die.</p>

      <p>Emperor Atrebe Sathir</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Rile's eldest son, Atrebe Sathir, unprepared for his inheritance to the empire, drew upon the dark powers of the Shissar legends and magiks for his source of power. Buried deep in his labs along with the greatest Iksar alchemists, he began experiments in breeding. His first result was a race of dragon-like soldiers called the Sarnak, powerful warriors and spellcasters used as fodder for his army. His second more successful breed was a great flying mount called Sokokar, a cross-breed of froglok and dragon. With this powerful new weapon, Atrebe builds an air force of winged knights, able to battle with the dragons of the sky.</p>

      <p>A great fifty four year war breaks out between Atrebe's armies and the Ring of Scale. Great devastation fell upon Kunark as drakes and wurms scorch the earth and tear apart the once great cities. In a final great battle, high above Cabilis, Atrebe himself battles the queen of Scale, Jaled Dar herself. In the greatest display of magic ever seen by mortals, the two embraced in combat, both destroying themselves in a huge column of fire over a mile wide. All that remained of the battle was the great crater known as the Field of Bone and the skull of Jaled-Dar, fallen leader of the Ring of Scale.</p>

      <p>The Fall of the Empire</p>

      
        
      

      <p>With no heir to the throne and much of their military in waste, the Iksar once again found themselves fragmented. The rebellious slave armies of goblins, giants and Sarnak broke apart the mighty empire, sending the bulk of the Iksar people to the port city of Cabilis.</p>

      <p>From a poisoned grave, the once great agent of Scale, Trakanon, arose. His soul had been stripped from the rotting husk of his body, a price he paid for vengeance against the Iksar. The Ring of Scale, now led by Phara-Dar turned the dead dragon away, marking him a traitor for his descent into the dark arts but with the aid of the freed Froglok slaves, Trakanon destroyed the last sorcerers of Sebilis and claimed the ancient city as his own lair.</p>

      <p>Sathir the Lich King</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Rumors spread that the legendary emperor of the Iksar, Venril Sathir, had returned from the dead, his attempt at immortality partially successful. He raised a powerful army of lycanthropic warriors, the Drolvargs, and overtook the feeble forces that held the fortress of the wizard Karnor. Sathir's bride, Druzilla, was buried along with her servants and protectors in the tomb of the once great city of Charasis. It was said the howls of the damned could be heard throughout the canyons, giving it the name Howling Stones to adventurers who crossed its path.</p>

      <p>Today, the Iksar continue to rebuild their once great empire one day at a time. Few know of the motivation of the lich-king Venril Sathir or his budding army of werewolves. Few know of the City of Mist or of Cabilis, and few know what the dracholiche Trakanon desires. It is rich hunting for the mighty adventurer and rich lore for the historians who dare to explore the ancient and lucrative ruins. Though of dubious morality, little can argue with the might of the once great Iksar empire.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 25: The Grey</h2>
  
<p>Jolain Goldenleaf stared out over the wastelands of the Grey. The vacuum of the land pulled his skin tight against his face and only the magical protection of his amulet kept his lungs from exploding in his chest. A long lock of his jet black hair fell across his scarred face. Dirt and grime covered the normal shine of his masterfully crafted and highly magical armor, a gift from the Coldain Dwarves for his services in their war against Kael Drakkal. His blade, the golden runed outer-planiar blade Nature's Defender, was caked with the acidic blood and clay of the burrowing worms, timeless golems, and skeletal slaves put in the land by their vile masters an eternity earlier.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>For a month Jolain had traveled to the vast wastelands of the Grey and for two weeks he had carved through the unliving creatures of the dead land. Five score of the beasts had fallen under his blade and Jolain was able to heal his wounds with the prayers of Tunare. For two weeks he fought outside the massive pyramid in the center of the wasteland learning much of the ancient snake-people and their minions.</p>

      <p>Jolain felt the ground tremble beneath his feet. In an instant Jolain's blade came up in time to parry a huge stone arm swinging inches away from his golden helmed head. The strength of the blow sent Jolain to the ground, but he swung hard at the beasts legs. The fine edge of Nature's Defender cut five inches into stone leg of the beast. The rockfiend, a faceless mass of rocks and shimmering ore held together by an unnatural magnetic bond, swung a massive fist and connected solidly with Jolain's chest blasting the breath from his magically filled lungs. Another swing smashed Jolain's head and sent his helmet spinning to the ground. Jolain's vision darkened into a fading tunnel and he felt a stream of warmth flow from the side of his head as he fell to the ground unconscious.</p>
      
      
        
      
      <p>Two weeks and a planet away, Loral entered the small office of Yeolarin Bronzeleaf, high priest of Felwithe. Yeolarin sat at a small table covered with many dishes of the fine foods of the church. On his left sat Tynkael, a leutenant of the Paladin's guild, and on his right sat a dark haired high elf wearing the deep red robes of an elder spellcaster but from which guild Loral couldn't guess. Yeolarin stood and embraced Loral then asked him about his travels in Luclin. The chit chat ended quickly when Leutenant Tynkael cleared his throat and Yeolarin bade Loral to sit. A plate of food was placed in front of Loral, though he mainly pushed it around as they talked.</p>

      <p>The same time Loral was sent to Luclin, Leutenant Tynkael explained, an agent of the Paladins guild was sent to gather information on the threat of the Shissar. Shortly after reporting of his journey to the Grey contact with the agent had stopped. Yeolarin took over the conversation and explained that the church had agreed to send someone to travel to Luclin and track down this lost paladin.</p>

      <p>Loral found the story ironic. The dangers of Luclin were well known and Loral was far from surprised to hear someone had gone missing. The paladin had most likely been killed by any number of horrors. To send a priest to rescue a single soldier didn't make much sense but Loral knew the loyalty of Felwithe. Even Loral was shocked by his own negativity towards the plight of the soldier. Loral looked to his longtime master, the high priest Yeolarin, and accepted the assignment.</p>
      

      <p>Two days later in the underground city of Shadowhaven, Loral met his friends and fellow members of Healers United; Juror Truespirit the powerful Shaman of the Tribunal, Raom Spirithealer the battle-hardened Paladin of Marr, Cymil Sylvanshot the graceful and deadly ranger, and Wrenne Celtes the fierce druid of Tunare.  Loral felt at home again among his old friends, relaxed and excited at their future adventure.</p>

      <p>For two weeks the party traveled through the abandoned tunnels of Netherbian's Lair, the hilly grasslands of Dawnshroud Peaks, the barren plains of Marus Seru and the dangerous canyons of Mons Letalis. Before they knew it they stood staring into the howling mouth of the cavern to the Grey. The next morning the adventurers put on their magical rings, necklaces and cloaks of enduring breath and stepped past the shimmering barrier that contained the vacuum of the Grey.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>The adventurers moved cautiously through the cave and into an ancient crypt.  While magical air filled their lungs, the vacuum removed all sound from the space around them. The eerie silence drew many concerned looks between the party as they climbed the stairs and stepped outside into the great wasteland of the Grey. All around them the cracked earth was split apart by giant rocks that seemed to fall from the bright blue sky above. Great hulking beasts made of stone and clay lumbered between the fallen rocks. The party made its way carefully among the fallen rocks and over a large ridge. There they saw the temple of Ssraeshza.</p>

      <p>Loral could feel the screams of a thousand generations of torment when his eyes beheld the horrific temple. To see such a construction in the center of such a desolate land was terrifying enough, but the dark aura of the place chilled the companions to the bone. Quietly the party walked closer to the finely crafted walls of the temple, built by the hands of a thousand skeletal slaves.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Without warning the Revenants attacked, their rotten serpentine bodies pushing them quickly across the ground. Loral gasped in horror when one of the beasts de-hinged its jaw to clamp down on his throat, but Loral was saved when the great stone blade of Raom's axe cleaved through the creatures back. Even the mighty stomach of Raom, hardened under a lifetime of ale, turned over when the creature twisted against the severed spine and silently hissed. Raom and the Shissar Revenant clenched together and Raom's feet slid as the creatures venomed claw closed in on his face. Raom's left hand let go of the axe handle and with a powerful magical blast he smashed the half-snake against the temple wall. Loral held his symbol of Tunare and whispered a prayer calling great tendrils from the earth around the serpentine body of the rotting horror. Another prayer sent rays of light bursting from the creatures broken chest and it slid to the ground, it's evil spirit departed.</p>

      <p>Loral turned in time to see Cymil's whirling blades finishing the second revenant. In a wide circular cut of the blade Earthcaller, Cymil sliced the throat of the beast and then sliding his arm tight to his body he stabbed through the beasts torso with twin blade Swiftwind.  The party was stunned to see the green blood boiling off the ground around the dead revenant.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>As they looked in horror, a great shadow of an enormous golem fell over the weary party. The beast stood as high as a hill giant, it's great fists as wide as Juror's shoulders. Juror was the first to act, channeling a cloud of insects around the beast while Wrenne called upon the powers of her Nature Walker's Scimitar, snaring the giant with roots of the earth. Loral called a blast of magical energy rocking the ancient creature on its heels. Raom's axe cut deep into the thick skin while Cymil's twin blades sliced pieces of clay and stone from the servit's chest and abdomin. With a silent roar, Juror stabbed his etherial tipped spear deep into the knee of the beast bringing it down to their level. Wrenne pointed at the beast and wildfire coursed over its body. Raom cleaved deep into the back of the creture's neck, almost severing it's head from the great body. Cymil dove out of the way as the five ton monster fell to the earth.</p>

      <p>The companions spoke little that night, huddled in the cave of Mons Letalis sharing blackened bread, fish rolls, and magically summoned water from Loral's powerful boots. The following morning Wrenne would be heading back to Norrath along with Juror. Cymil and Raom would be returning to Shadowhaven to learn more in the inns and taverns of the newly discovered city. A snicker broke the heavy air when Juror asked how much they planned to discover at the bottom of a keg of porter, but Loral's mind was elsewhere. He told them of his plans to study the lands more, and they knew that was a half-truth at best. Loral had little choice if he wished to follow through with the orders of the Church. He would have to enter the temple of Ssraeshza and face whatever horrors lay within.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 26: Ssraeshza</h2>
  
<p>For one hundred twenty years Yylis had been a slave of the Shissar. For seventy of those years he had worked on the pyramid in the middle of the ocean. Day and night for seventy years the temple had been carved by the Iksar slaves and enchanted by the Shissar warlocks.  For a thousand years the Shissar had ruled Norrath, but their time on the green world was at an end.  A new life would begin for them elsewhere.</p>

<p>Slavery was the only life Yylis knew.  He felt no love, no pride, no anger. He only felt hopelessness and despair. Yylis had seen his mate die and brought back as a horrible skeletal creature to continue the work she had done in life. His children were taken from him at birth while he did nothing to stop it, knowing resistance meant death and undead servitude. He never saw his children again. There was no escape from the Shissar or their tyranny, there was only obedience.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>One day the Shissar taskmasters sent hundreds of Iksar into the great temple while hundreds more were packed around the outside, crushing them against the outer stone walls. Buried in a mass of his Iksar companions, Yylis watched the Shissar nobles enter the temple, breathing their last breath of Norrathian air. Yylis felt his ribs crack as even more slaves were forced around the great temple. Through his agony he heard the chanting of the serpent warlocks, coming from around the perimeter of the slave horde. A blinding magical sphere began to form around the pyramid and slave horde cutting the unlucky Iksar who formed the outside ring of the horde into pieces as it reached the ground. Then they were gone. The green sky of Norrath was replaced with the blue sky of the Grey. The sphere of his home world stood hanging above them.  Before he could comprehend the strange sight, Yylis's lungs burst in his chest as did the lungs of the thousand slaves left outside in the vacuum of the Grey. All around him the Iksar slaves fell dead with no last sound, no scream, no final plea or proclamation. Yylis knew as his eyes went dark that his servitude had just begun.</p>

      <p>Five thousand years later the corpse of Yylis walked outside the temple of Ssraeshza. Long gone were any memories of his life, now only the three word command of the Shissar necromancers filled his head - protect the temple. For five thousand years he had guarded this temple, skin peeling away from his bones, eyes sinking into his skull, fingers cracking into horrible sharp claws.  Then one day he was released.  A great blast of pure light broke him into pieces. A blue armored cleric of Tunare stood twenty feet away, white wisps of holy energy drifting up from his hands. After five thousand years, Yylis had finally found peace.</p>
      
        
      

      <p>Loral walked over and picked up the ancient skull of the Iksar slave. For a brief moment he felt a great weight of sadness for the Iksar. He felt the torment of millions of slaves over thousands of years. The Iksar had truly lost everything.  There was nothing in their lives but horror and sadness. Loral looked up to the giant Shissar statues flanking the tunnel leading deep into the temple and understood the true meaning of evil.</p>

      <p>Loral was no stranger to evil.  He had felt the sickening blood-rain run over his face in the Plane of Fear. His mind had swam with the paranoia and rage that flowed through the air of the Plane of Hate. This tunnel was somewhere different, somewhere outside the influence of the Gods of Norrath. It was a temple of defilers and the weight of his future should he enter fell upon him. Loral clasped his hand around his warden symbol of Tunare and stepped into the tunnel.</p>

      <p>"Good, You're here", said the Sorceress Azile as if they were walking into Tovania's Venom in Felwithe.  Loral was shocked at her presence, but she seemed not surprised in the least to see him.  Her small but strong hand took Loral by the arm and led him down a short finely carved hallway of the entrance to Ssraeshza. At the end stood a large set of carved stone doors. Azile closed her eyes and tilted her head, Loral noted the glimmer from the lotus symbol on her dark red robes. "They are ready for us downstairs," She said reaching into a small pouch on her belt. Chanting a quick incantation, Azile and Loral faded from sight.</p>

      <p>The oddity of seeing his longtime friend in this horror of a place shook Loral's thoughts into a jumbled mess. It felt like the chaos of a dream forming just before falling asleep. His thoughts became clear, however, when the twin doors opened and revealed the Shissar guardians. Standing over ten feet tall and adorned with finely crafted golden armor, the Shissar protectors stood guard in the large tiered room.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Though the presence of the Shissar demanded attention, Loral's eyes were drawn to a huge stone carving above the corridor directly across from them.  A sudden addition to the horror of the Shissar's rule became clear. The Shissar required slaves even when retreating to the void of the Grey, that was already known to the Elven sages. But the Shissar aparently used the Soriz tribe for more than just labor.</p>

      <p>They used them for food.</p>

      <p>Visions flooded into Loral's mind. Iksar families being torn apart, the strong being sent to work until death, the weak being harvested to feed the isolated Shissar masters. Surely any escape from such treatment, even at the poisoned hand of Cazic Thule himself, was not simply a choice for the lost people, but a necessity. With the trials of the Elven nation of Tunaria and the fall of Takish Hiz, Loral wondered whether the high elves could have chosen any differently.</p>

      <p>Azile ran between a pair of the serpent beasts and Loral felt his skin crawl when one of the creatures hissed, apparently at nothing at all. Loral followed Azile through the twisting corridors and down a great floating column of thick air that led down into the depths of the dark temple. There they joined fellow members of Lotus Cult in their hunt of the undead Iksar slaves as they dug deep into a mine-shaft.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>For hours they battled the vile skeletons.  Azile's spells blasted through the creatures while Loral's spells of healing sealed the wounds of Lotus Cult's great fighters.  Through the onslaught of skeletal slaves attacking the small raiding party one point had struck home. It had been Loral's hope to find the Shissar dormant in their sinister lair, buried under the wastelands of Luclin and no danger to Felwithe. This was not the case, the Shissar were active indeed.</p>

      <p>The Shissar were digging.</p>

      <p>Surely this information was critical to report to Felwithe. Surely if Norrath ever faced a truly dangerous enemy, the Shissar was it. Loral's decision was clear, he must return to Felwithe and report on this news. Rescuing the lost Paladin would have to wait until the elders could figure out a true battle plan against the Shissar.</p>

<p> Loral explained his plan to Azile and she nodded her agreement. He reached into his dusty ransacker pack and pulled out the Faithstone of Nature. A powerful artifact given by the Hierophant Skrabbit on behalf of Lotus Cult, the Faithstone had the ability to return Loral back to the church of Felwithe with with but a single prayer. Loral began the chant and soon faded away.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>A dark magic, a millenia old, spliced into the conduit of the ethereal tunnel and pulled the visage of the Tunarian priest off track. Loral shook off the unbalance of magical teleportation and opened his eyes. Instead of the warm arms of the church Loral had spent his entire childhood in, he found himself in a dark chamber deep within the temple of Ssraeshza. Loral heard the hissing of the Shissar High Priests all around him, their red eyes looking at him as they would a dead thing. Loral pulled his blue draconian helmet off from his matted hair and let it fall to the floor. He closed his eyes and whispered a prayer to Tunare. He knew no answer would come.</p>

  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 27: Darkness</h2>
  
<p>"It was a dark moment, my boy. Perhaps darker than any I had faced before. The ancient serpents paralyzed me mentally and physically with powers not seen on the face of Norrath in five thousand years. They studied me as they would have studied a strange rock. While the minutes crept by like hours they continued hissing to each other, their burning yellow eyes never leaving mine. Only one fate seemed possible. I was surely dead."</p>

      <p>Loral paused and scratched his newly grown beard, a habit he knew drove his avid listener crazy. Though the warm breeze and soft rustle of the trees created one of the most serene moments Loral had ever witnessed, his companion, a small Elven boy, seemed ready to break under the tension of Loral's tale. Just as the boy was about to protest, shouting his rage of impatience, Loral continued.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>"Their decision had apparently been made. The largest of their number, a great ancient serpent covered with deeply etched glyphes in its rotting scales, moved forward extending a jagged claw towards my face. Red bolts of energy shot from nail to nail as it got closer. But before that horrible claw tore my face and mind from my body and spirit, the creature's head exploded into white light and dark green gore."</p>

      <p>The boy literally bounced with excitement.</p>

      <p>"Zolina knocked another arrow and let it fly into the chest of the glyphed serpent. Juror's powerful spirit-tipped spear skewered one of the guardians while the rescue party stepped through Tarzel's planar gateway. The shining runed blade of Lavun tore open a rift in the fabric of nature releasing a great green hand of roots, moss and vines that crushed another attacking Shissar between its giant fingers.  A huge golem, as large as the fire giants of Nagafen's Lair roared towards the party but a bolt of pure energy burned a hole straight through the beast. I saw the smoking hands and grey eyes of Azile through the hole in the chest of the golem just before it crashed to the ground. Knowing I was safe, my mind turned off and I fell unconscious into the arms of my friends."</p>

      <p>Relief flowed into the boy and he fell back against the large oak behind him. Loral smiled and tugged at the fishing line cutting into the mirror surface of the small lake they sat by. Though the boy had heard the story before, he never seemed any less nervous at the outcome than he had here today. Remembering his own actions at hearing such tales of adventure, Loral looked to the boy and smiled. Darlan was a wonderful son, indeed.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Loral's mind trailed back those seventy five years as he thought about the tale of the Shissar. How much his life had changed. How much Norrath had changed. While that day had been dark indeed, many dark days had followed. The Shissar had been a great menace but even they stayed buried in their tomb when the rifts opened. Magic had grown from a thing of mystery and wonder into the norm of everyday life. Merchants and tradesmen no longer traveled in caravans or on ships preferring the speed and safety of teleportation. The Antonican bards had disbanded under the competition of the psychic abilities of wizard guilds. It was a different age.</p>

      <p>Then chaos began. It started with reports of travelers becoming lost during teleportation. Stories of parties appearing buried in rock or returning transformed into horrible manifestations circulated. Then the rifts opened. Planiar beasts of fire, stone, flesh and crustation poured into the lands. Armies of city militia were slaughtered by creatures never dreamed of in the worst nightmares of children. Powerful adventurers far and wide returned to their homelands and thus began the Plane Wars.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>For ten years the wars raged, destroying cities and gods. Loral's powers of healing fed armies of Elven knights, rangers and warriors. Deep in the wizard guilds of Odus, Felwithe, Neriak and Freeport the great spellcasters looked for an end to the menace and just when all seemed lost, they found it.</p>

      <p>Life began again for the people of Norrath. After 120 years of service to the Mother, Loral retired to the life of a jeweler and though his mate, the only mortal woman Loral had ever loved, had been slain in the last days of the Plane Wars, Loral's life was lived again through the eyes of his son.</p>

      <p>With the turn of the seasons, Loral and Darlan traveled across Norrath. Over the months they traded the intricate mechanics of Ak'Anon with the velium of the hearty Coldain and the finely crafted gems of Odus for the black acrylia of Luclin. They found great profit in their lives but living his adventures through Darlan was the greatest treasure of all.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Now spring brought them back to Felwithe where they fished during the day and met with old friends in the nearby cities at night. Though his trials had been great over the past two centuries, Loral had finally found the happiness he always sought.</p>

      <p>Dark telepathic visions passed from the Shissar interrogator to the ancient glyphed serpent. The beast studied the pale elf, pinned ten feet off the ground by the titanic arms of two enormous golems. Bolts of dark energy sliced through the figure, sending him into spasms. The interrogator had performed such operations before and few had ever survived. Though this broken priest still had some sort of mental activity, the Shissar wasn't convinced that the tiny mortal hadn't already gone insane. A few more hours would tell, but it was doubtful that this one would live through the night.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 28: Light</h2>
  
<p>"And what of the heroic paladin lost to the Shissar? What ever happened to him?"</p>

      <p>Loral had told his son the tale of his rescue in Ssraeshza many times but this was the first time Darlan had asked this question. Loral found it puzzling, not just the question but something else. A burning sensation in his hand interrupted his train of thought but a voice in the nearby woods took back his attention.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>"Aye, old friend, what ever did happen to that broken down old knight."  Stepping out of the brush to the grassy hill where Loral and Darlan sat with their picnic came Jolain Goldenleaf dressed in the traditional silver and gold armor of the Felwithe paladins. Resting over one shoulder was his legendary blade, Nature's Defender, and a green cloak fell lazily over the other. He held his golden helmet next to his hip.  A lock of his jet black hair had come free from his neat pony tail and fell across his scarred face. Loral stood and embraced his old friend.</p>

      <p>For an hour the two traded tales of their adventures. While Loral and Darlan had been traveling across Antonica, Jolain had been training Felwithe's newest recruits. This day his students traveled through the forest of the Faydark, keeping a watchful eye for orc invaders who, even two hundred years later, continued to pour forth from Crushbone.</p>

      <p>Their tales shifted to their partnership during the plane wars, entertaining young Darlan with visions of the golden armies of elves and stout dwarves standing strong against giant and powerful demons never meant to walk Norrath. For ten years Loral and Darius had served together, fighting the unnatural horrors of the outer planes and pushing them back to and finally through the rifts to their own planes. Although highly entertained with such marvelous tales, Darlan's original question returned.</p>

      <p>"How was Sir Goldenleaf returned from Ssraeshza?"</p>

      <p>"Aye, friend, I have little recollection of the event. What ever did become of the vile Shissar?" Both Jolain and Darlan looked to Loral. The burning became stronger in Loral's hand, breaking his concentration on the question. Images of the Shissar flashed into his mind, jolting him suddenly and ringing his ears, but Jolain's questions continued.</p>

      <p>"Did the elves know of the tunnels below? Were the cities of Norrath planning an assault? What of Katta Castellum or Sanctus Seru? What did those cities know of the threat of the Shissar?" Jolain's questions pounded inside his head. Gone was the sweet sound of birds chirping and crickets seeking their mates. Gone was the sound of the water passing down the rocky stream. All he heard was the hissing questions and all he felt was the white hot burning sensation in the center of his left palm.</p>

      <p>Then it all became clear. Loral looked into the eyes of Jolain and raised his palm towards the knight. A beam of pure white light burst forth, turning the armored elf into ash. The beam continued, searing through the forest like paper and seeming to crack the very fabric of the world in half. The scene around him shattered like a rock being thrown through a mirror. Loral found himself in darkness.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Immediate was the pain he felt all throughout him. He screamed when he tried to move. His one eye opened, the other swollen shut, and beheld the great glyphed Shissar before him. To his right he saw the great golem pinning him to the walls of the dark temple with giant clay hands. Not a muscle in his body or a nerve in his head was free from the electrical energies the Shissar spells pumped through him. With a mouth capable of swallowing his hole head, the glyphed serpent hissed at him, exposing great fangs as long as Loral's forearm. The ancient beast reached forward, preparing to tear out the troublesome elf's heart when the room went silent.</p>

      <p>Visions of battle and fire filled Loral's head. The glyphed serpent turned towards another smaller Shissar and hissed an intricate throaty command. The smaller snake replied and the two turned and slithered towards the great door at the other end of the large room.</p>

      <p>A moment later, the great golem that pinned Loral's arms to the wall stepped away and Loral fell to the floor in a crumpled ball of agony. It thundered quickly out the door leaving Loral alone in the large room.</p>

      <p>It took all of Loral's energy to remember how to breathe.  His one open eye spotted a golden glimmer a short distance away. His left arm broken above the elbow, Loral shifted to his right side and inched across the floor, each move bringing waves of pain and blackness. Twelve feet and an eternity later, Loral found the source of the golden glimmer, a small idol of Tunare poking out of his five large packs. That golden glimmer turned into a glimmer of hope. Loral snaked his good arm through the straps of his worn leather packs and drew out the Faithstone of Nature. He whispered his prayers to Tunare and held the stone close. Thirty seconds later, the room flashed away and he was lying on the marble floors of the Church of Felwithe hearing the gasps of Yeolarn and the priests of the Mother.</p>

      
        
      
      <p>Dog raised his large head from the thick grass as the voice of Mother filled his mind. As always, a great feeling of love and warmth filled him when he heard it, even if he knew it meant having to leave his games with Rex or his meals to help her. Dog trotted through the large woods, past the great tree where Mother stayed and past the walking trees that guarded her. He ran through the blue stream taking joy in the great splash and the feeling of water soaking into his thick fur. Soon he came upon four large pillars and an open marble floor. In the center was a small one, dressed in a light yellow robe. Dog had been asked to help before, mostly to show the small ones who appeared towards the great tree, but sometimes not.</p>

<p>Today, Dog had to point the small one away, back to the glowing tunnel that stood to the side of the large platform. Dog licked the small one's face rolling it over onto its back. Dog turned his head to the side and perked up his ears hearing the faint beat within the small one's chest. Another great lick and the small one bolted upright. Dog could smell the fear in the small one, but felt it leave when the small one looked into Dog's eyes. With his great muzzle, Dog pushed the small one onto its feet and pushed it back into the tunnel from where it came. When the small one had left, Dog trotted back to his original resting place, assured that he had done well and salivating at the smell of his sixth meal of the day waiting for him.</p>

      <p>"It was as real as the life I have lived until now."  Loral sat with Juror in the small bar of Shadowhaven and recounted his tale four weeks after his return to the temple. "Two hundred years I had lived, all illusions of the Shissar trying to tear open my mind."  The large barbarian, much wiser than his great size imparted, sat and listened to the cleric's tale. It wasn't until the end of Loral's story, detailing a life that had never been lived, that Juror shared a piece of information that explained Loral's chance for escape.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>"Lotus Cult killed the Glyphed Covered Serpent shortly after you left," Juror's deep voice said calmly.  Loral looked at the barbarian for a long time.  Although his head still swam with the false-life the Shissar had implanted, the relief of knowing the vile creature that fed it to him was killed took a great weight off of his shoulders.  He looked to his friend again and became aware of the large barbarian's greying hair and lined face.  How long the two of them had served their deities.  How long they had worked together within the great network of Healers that spanned so many races and so many societies.  While Loral had certainly aged less physically in his 110 years of service, he felt no younger than his friend looked.</p>

      <p>Later that night Loral rested in the darkness, staring up at the ceiling of the small stone room of the inn in Shadowhaven. In two days he would be traveling to Katta Castellum to look into an unknown undead menace that could possibly be in the area. The church had sent word of the discovery and Juror gave Loral information to further the claim. Fellow members of Healers United would meet him in the dark city, and they would investigate and deal with the threat.</p>

      <p>The unknown threat was not on his mind, however. Loral knew the Healers would be able to deal with such a menace, whatever it turned out to be. Instead Loral's mind went back through a life he never lived, mourning the death of a wife he never had. A tear fell across his cheek before he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 29: The Godslayer</h2>
  
<p>Since the dawn of Norrath, pain, torment, and horror all paid homage to the Plane of Fear. Dark demons and foul spellcrafters delighted in the terror of mortals, reveling in their power as servants to one of the most powerful gods of Norrath, Cazic Thule. The Faceless, as he was sometimes called, had the largest number of followers in all the lands and there had never been a threat to his reign as the Lord of Fear. This day, however, he faced the worst danger he ever knew.</p>

<p>The fiends watched in curiosity as the rifts opened. Large tears in the fabric of their world sucked foul air into Norrath on the other side of the rifts. The scouts came first, recognized as Iksar by the minions of Fear. One such demon, a bat-winged fiend known as Gamblazan, glided forward towards a scout, planning to tear open the small lizard for its intrusion. But the lean Iksar struck first, stabbing through the naturally armored chest of the red beast with his ethereal tipped spear. Gamblazan stared down at the mortal and fell dead to the tainted earth.</p>

<p>With a rhythmic rumble, five hundred Iksar poured through two dozen rifts into the Plane of Fear. Alraza Thule, the Bloodqueen, looked over to Dread, another of Thule's demi-gods, and shrugged in confusion. This confusion soon disappeared when behind the Iksar army slithered 
in the Shissar.</p>

<p>A war greater than one ever seen upon Norrath filled the Plane of Fear. Waves of roaring magma turned scores of screaming Iksar into ash. More were tossed into the air only to come crashing down, bursting into gore. The destruction of their slave army did little to discourage the Shissar Warmasters. While their well equipped fodder distracted the minions of Thule, the Shissar struck at Cazic Thule's children, the demi-gods of Fear.</p>

<p>Twelve great sorcerers hurled great beams of pure energy at the hulking wolf-headed beast, Gromhazik the Chaosfiend. His pitch black skin split and charred, burning down to the bone. Arunz the Amygdalan King carved through dozens of the Iksar soldiers when the telekinetic grasp of five Shissar channelers took hold. Arunz screamed loud enough to turn every head, mortal and immortal, until a power greater than the combined strength of every giant of Norrath ripped him to pieces.</p>

<p>Watching from a nearby hill, the Bloodqueen began a great incantation when a powerful blow from behind stole the words from her lips. She looked down to the golden-runed blade protruding from her chest. Twisting around she beheld her slayer, the Shissar King Ssraeshza. With a sneer, the Shissar lord pushed the dead demi-goddess off of his blade and wiped the black blood on her rotten mantle.</p>

<p>Seeing three of his children die in as many minutes told Cazic Thule of the danger he faced. Beckoning for one of his alchemists, he roared instructions to the quivering beast. They had only one chance, releasing the Greenmist.</p>

<p>A great cloud of green fog flowed out of the Amygdalan temple and wafted through the confused combatants, both demonic and Iksar alike. Not until he saw four of his generals fall over dead amidst healthy troops did the threat become clear to the Shissar King. Looking over at the great form of The Faceless, he cursed, and along with his remaining generals, the lord of the Shissar left the Plane of Fear through one of the remaining rifts back to Norrath.</p>

<p>But the Greenmist followed and five thousand years later the Emperor of the Shissar could still feel its weight on his shoulders. He felt too the sickening feeling that Cazic Thule must have felt when the Lord of Fear saw true danger at the hands of mortals. The lord of the Shissar, Emperor Ssraeshza, had seen his generals slain, his oldest and most trusted advisors cut down, and his personal guard neutralized. His greatest creation, the Blood Golem, a construct built from the lifeblood of five hundred generations of Iksar and protected under the greatest spells of protection his priests could provide, had been cut down in his own inner sanctum.</p>

<p>Now he stood and looked into the eyes of his slayer. The mortal adventurer stood in front of him, cutting deep with blades forged to pierce his impenetrable scales and bathed in a beam of energy fed by a dozen high priests of a dozen different gods. For each mortal cut the emperor inflicted on this warrior, the wound closed as soon as the ancient blade had finished the stroke. The air burst around him into fire, ice, and electricity. Four dozen other blades cut into his scaled skin but this avatar of a dozen gods took all of his attention. This warrior had become a vehicle of revenge for all the gods 
perverted by word and deed of the ancient Shissar emperor and could not 
die.  With a final cut, the most devastating ruler to ever walk Norrath 
was 
killed."</p>

<p>It had been two weeks since Loral returned from the Temple of Ssraeshza. He sat at the end of the bar of the inn of Shadowhaven where he had spent many of his nights in luclin. At one table sat three trolls, one sharing the tale of the death of the Shissar emperor with his disbelieving companions. The golden-runed blade strapped to his back spoke a greater truth than the trolls loud voice. When Loral looked too long at the wicked blade he felt a hiss in his mind and was reminded of the treachery he felt under the terrible powers of the Shissar interrogator. What tales that blade could tell, he thought, and wondered whether it might ever find the chest of a mighty or terrible god again.</p>

<p>At the other side of the bar stood a young elven paladin.  She looked with disdain upon the troll discussion, turning quickly into a table-breaking bar brawl. The bartender did nothing to intervene, knowing the purses of the trolls to be as large as their mighty ale-filled bellies. Loral watched the fiery-haired Paladin glare at the troll and turn away to finish her champagne cocktail. How much he was reminded of his early days after leaving Felwithe. The paladin had no idea of the horror that troll may have saved Norrath from. Possibly neither did the troll, thinking the Emperor was but another big game hunt. For the young knight of Tunare, the troll was but an annoying disturbance in a normally quiet bar.</p>

<p>The purple and red cross clasped to the paladin's cloak sent Loral's thoughts down a different stream.  For eighty of his 100 years of adventure, Loral had been a member of Healers United.  Unlike the highly political climate between Felwithe's rulership and the Church of Tunare, Loral found a network crossing many faiths, cities, races, and experiences.  It was a large shift from the stereotypical views Felwithe had given the young priest.  Loral was shocked to find the band led by a dark elf priestess of Innoruuk, but after one meeting with Dahlea, Loral saw the kindness behind her sharp gaze and knew he found the right group.  Soon the barbarian oracle, Juror, led the group with his strict adherence to the balance of the Tribunal.  Loral had countless adventures with the members of the Healers and assisted in the protection of young adventurers on their first hunts.  While Loral had found a wonderful tool to help in his travels and a wonderful group of friends to share those travels with, learning of the small differences between the races of Norrath was the lesson that helped Loral the most.  He was richer for the experiences and knowledge of his friends, whatever their race or beliefs.  He suddenly realized just how much Ciric's teachings of balance had helped him.  Without those insights he may never have accepted the Healers or many of the friends he met along his journeys.</p>

<p>Loral remembered stories of the Erudite's first adventures in Norrath. Travelers hardly ever left the safety of their cities.  In those days, transportation was by foot or boat.  The magic of teleportation had yet to be discovered. Beasts ruled the lands between the walled cities and much of the magic and artifacts were buried in hidden tombs of long forgotten empires.  With the discovery of teleportation and of the Nexus, new gateways between far off lands became possible and and with the erosion of geographical 
boundaries, the separation of the races became thin as well.</p>

<p>The world had changed in the hundred years Loral had traveled in the service of Tunare. But in many ways he had changed while the world had not. Loral looked at the trolls, once sworn enemies of the elves. The troll storyteller returned his gaze.  Loral raised his glass to the storyteller and smiled.  The troll smiled a toothy grin and returned the toast. Many of these changes were good indeed.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, the Plane Wars began.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 30: Disease</h2>
  
<p>Loral looked with revulsion into the pit that led into the Plane of Disease and the giant pipe that eternally poured forth the black liquid inside. The stench of the pit overwhelmed him, burning the inside of his nose and causing his lungs to constrict. The tainted fountain was a dark contrast to the beauty of the land that surrounded it. The Plane of Tranquility promised an eternal peace. It was the land Loral always dreamed of - a land of green grass, clear waters, and quiet solitude. Like the curled demonic finger of an ancient beast protruding through the ground, the spout of disease-ridden fluid reminded Loral of his task. He would have to enter this infested portal. Loral slipped on his turtle-bone ring and breathed in the clean air that flowed from the ring's innate mystical power. With a final look around, he dove into the tainted pit.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>A great splash of the vile liquid deposited the cleric into the Plane of Disease. Loral landed hard on one knee, gritting his teeth. One hand clutched the Symbol of Tunare around his neck and the other gripped an ethereal hammer. If the smell of the sewer in Tranquility was revolting, the smell of this new world was unimaginable. Loral gagged at first, even with the aid of his magical ring. A fog rolled over the stone slab where Loral found himself. A great green lake, foul and thick, surrounded the slab on three sides while a wall of rotting flesh reached into the grey sky above.</p>
      <p>A clap on his shoulder shot Loral upright, sending a wave of nervous energy down into his fingertips. When he turned, he saw the grin of two hundred teeth and the emerald eyes of Rasthik the beastlord. If Loral found himself assaulted by the odor of this place, he could not imagine how Rasthik was managing to survive. The lizard-man could smell the blood of a dead Vampyre from a quarter mile away. Loral heard another splash and Warrick the barbarian shaman fell from the portal to the slab. Loral noticed that Warrick had taken the less subtle approach of sticking two twisted rags into his nostrils to avoid the stench. Loral smiled but his smile quickly faded when he remembered where he and his friends had come.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Loral had spent weeks in the Library of New Tanaan upon arriving in the Plane of Knowledge. He had been sent by the Church of Tunare to investigate the new portals manifesting themselves as books on pedestals all over Norrath's great cities. While the ethereal nature of the planes reminded Loral how different they were from Norrath, it was in the old tomes and dusty parchments of the great library that he fully lost himself. For Loral they were a king's treasure, rivaling that of Lord Nagafen the red dragon. For weeks he buried himself in the precious documents, filled with ancient legends written by hands dead for centuries. Large candles burned down to their bases as he passed the days and nights reading the histories of civilizations and gods long forgotten. It was in those magnificent volumes, covered by millennia of dirt, mold, and cobwebs, that he discovered the tales of Lxanvom, the King's Rest, and its exile into the Plane of Disease.</p>
      <p>Two wolves ran up the rotten flesh bank of the festering lake. Their paws floated over the surface, seeming to move half the speed of the great distance they traveled. When they arrived, the wolves shifted form into two elven rangers of the Healers, Taey and Brooken. Another splash from the invisible portal dropped Isos the Paladin onto the great slab. Together the companions began their trek over the putrid lands of the Bertoxxulous, the Plaguebringer.</p>
      <p>Loral remembered hearing Ciric and Azile talk about the outer Planes. He always found his mind had trouble wrapping around their concept. Ciric explained it best once when comparing it to a scale, with Norrath at the center. Norrath was a balance between good and evil. Many lands and many people, both good and evil, existed all in one world. The further out of the scale you went, the less balance things had. While the Plane of Sky, Growth, and Tranquility were on one side; Fear, Hate, and Nightmare were on the other. There was little balance in many of these planes; they were either good or evil. Nowhere was this clearer than in the Plane of Disease.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Taey's blade severed two of the spined legs of a gigantic insect-like Malarian. The creature returned the attack by spitting an acidic liquid on the ranger through its elongated stinger. Taey recoiled and retched as the acid ate away at her armor and skin. Two of Brooken's crackling arrows slammed into the bloated abdomen of the winged beast as it took flight. A quick prayer from Loral sent a wave of blue energy from his hand to the wounded ranger neutralizing the acid and soothing Taey's wounds. The creature twisted and stared with giant compound eyes upon the meddling cleric, its remaining legs clicking with agitation.</p>
      <p>Telepathic visions flooded into Loral's mind - images of the violent insect ripping Loral's arms off and burrowing its extended maw into his chest. Loral breathed deeply, canceling the horrific images from his mind. He raised a hand and a burning red energy of condemnation crushed the beast's exoskeleton. The creature fell to the ground, breaking into a cloud of noxious gasses. The party jumped back from the infectious cloud but then cheered at each other. The victory was short lived, however, when they saw the spiders, diseased rats and beetles, flowing ooze, and deformed humanoids waiting for them across the fleshy hills.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>For two days Loral traveled across the vile lands. While some adventurers left and others joined, the party crossed streams of sickly bile and walls of scabbed flesh and exposed bone. The world around them appeared to be a single living thing that simply grew into chaos. Soon they came to a large set of what appeared to be vertebrae and beyond it was the first mortal constructed structure they had seen since the stone slab - The Crypt of Decay.</p>
      <p>It was at this ancient structure that Loral witnessed the first sentient beings of this world, the Magi of Bertoxxulous. Empty eye sockets of the Deathbone Magi stared blankly at the party, their rotten chapped lips whispering arcane spells of ancient times. Great fires erupted around the adventurers, but they were quick to retaliate and defeat the plagued wizards.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>With trepidation the party carefully made their way into the crypt, having now expanded into two dozen adventurers. It was as they reached the balcony of the great hall that Gryme, the Crypt Guardian, attacked. Gryme was enormous, as wide as a hill giant is tall. His body was covered with exposed bone wrapped in folds of decaying flesh. His chain-wrapped fists slammed into the front-line attackers of the raiding force, sending them sliding across the stone floor or hurling them into the air.</p>
      <p>A mighty battle ensued. Dozens of arrows bore deep into the back of the giant but seemed to harm it little. Wizards, both Gnomish and Erudite, called forth huge shards of ice and burning rocks upon the beast. The raiders rushed in, cutting deep into the thick festering flesh of the creature. With a great heaving breath, Gryme vomited a cloud of poisonous gas, sending the attackers to their knees. Loral and the other priests of the raiding force sent wave after wave of healing energy into those who had been caught within the cloud. Soon Loral felt the last amount of Tunare's energy leave him. With little left to do, he drew forth his magical hammer of Judgment and rushed in. Gryme's iron clad knuckles smashed into Loral. The blow shattered his nose and knocked him instantly unconscious.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>The crack of his nose being pushed back into place jolted Loral awake but before the wave of pain drove him back to unconsciousness he felt a warmth of energy flow through him, soothing and mending the bone. He sat upright, once again gagging as the smell of the accursed land flooded into his nostrils. The mound of the decaying corpse of Gryme and the recovering raiding party was nearby. Many had fallen to the horrid breath of the rotting crypt guardian and many others had been crushed by his heavily-armored fists.</p>
      <p>One of the raiders with the stomach strong enough to approach the corpse of Gryme, a powerful human warrior named Zarcharius, found a tiny key attached to a rope around the beast's engorged neck. The grim warrior looked up towards the stairway that led deeper into the crypt. It was clear that a good part of him wished he never had found the key, just as many of his fellow adventurers wish they hadn't stepped foot into this diseased world. But a gleam in his eye, one of adventure and discovery, drove him forward. He drew his gleaming black-runed blade and walked up the ancient staircase of the crypt. Everyone else followed.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 31: Nightmare</h2>
  
<p>Breath burned through Loral's lungs as he raced across the land of Nightmares. He could hear the pursuing hobgoblins getting closer as their claws tore up the ground behind him. Purple luminescent clouds raced across the eternally black sky and the elongated fingers of long dead trees reached for Loral, whipping past him as he ran. Loral tripped on a stone as eager for his death as the pursuing demons. He was up with a flash, his blood pumping through his veins. The hobgoblins licked their lips in anticipation of the feast... for nothing was as sweet as the blood of a mortal. The leader of the pursuing demons leapt forward and clawed at Loral's back. Two of the 12-inch claws were turned away by Loral's draconian armor but the third ripped across the back of his neck down to the bone.</p>
      <p>Loral's vision blurred from shock but his legs did not stop. Ahead he saw the gates of Thule. Towering over 15 feet tall, the skeletal guardians of the gate would easily finish the job the hobgoblins started. Their eyes blazed and they smiled a grin of a thousand needle-like teeth when they saw Loral coming. Loral had one more trick. A word to Tunare surrounded him with an impenetrable shield of force. The claws of the mighty guardians skimmed off of the shield and Loral ran through the gates into the lair of Terris Thule.</p>
      <p>Loral collapsed to the ground, blood flowing from the wound on his neck. A warmth traveled over the wound, closing it and sending waves of relief into Loral's body. He looked up into the smiling face of Axen, dwarf priest of Brell and cleric of Lotus Cult. Loral realized he was surrounded by the hunters of the Cult. Loral was lifted to his feet by the strong hand of the troll warlord, Grongl, who grinned at him with yellow teeth.</p>
      <p>"On behalf of the church of Tunare and the adventurers of Healers United, I offer my services to you for this exploration," Loral stuttered.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>"Exploration? BAH!" roared Grongl at the priest. "This is an execution! You wish to help? Keep me alive." Grongl walked off laughing. Loral turned to meet the calm gaze of Binedina, the barbarian priestess and leader of the guild. Holding her fur cloaks tight around her, she nodded to Loral and smiled. Beside her, Loral met the cool gaze of a dark elf dressed in soft black leather from head to foot. Her master of assassins, Loral guessed, although the assassin's form seemed to change each time they met. Loral had known Gnix for years but could never guess what race he truly was. The assassin smiled.</p>
      <p>There was little time for further greetings. The raiding party was divided into groups, each member protecting the others with spell, prayer, or steel. Blades came free from their sheaths and scouts were sent out into the valleys of the Nightmare Queen. For a few brief moments, the only sound was the howling wind that blew through the canyons. Soon the scouts returned. They were not alone.</p>
      <p>Built from the tormented souls of mighty heros, heros who betrayed their kings, the Protectors of Nightmares learned obedience from the clenched fist of Terris Thule. Possessing a power greater than most armies, the giant skeletal demons fought with a fury unseen in mortal worlds. A sweep of their powerful arms sent men and women of legend crashing into the walls. Fire burst around them from the magics of the raiding sorcerers. Blades cut deep into the black armor of the minions, chipping at the bones beneath. With a final howl of damnation, the Protectors of Nightmares fell.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>For two days, the raiding party traveled through the canyons. They met with only a few of Terris Thule's guardians but each one fought with the rage of eternal torment. The raiding party planned well for these encounters, mixing powerful magics and combat tactics to defeat the mounted riders. It was on their third day that the party found the inner sanctum of the Queen of Nightmares.</p>
      <p>For years, Terris Thule, the Dream Scorcher, had seen the paths of mortals through their twisted dreams. Deep in her keep she closed her eyes and envisioned the coming army, secure in her powers and her defenses. An arcane whisper brought spheres of protection around her skin, protection from both blade and spell. She looked around the hall, insuring all was in place. She waited. Soon the attackers entered.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Grongl stepped forward into the hall, the rest of the party moving in a half circle around him. He drew his swords, Bloodfrenzy and the Blade of Carnage. A single shout from the troll warlord sent the raid into action. Spellcasters began their incantations while a rain of arrows fell upon the demi-goddess. The arrows exploded into energy around her, though none hit home. Waves of ice and flame rushed over Terris Thule, blocked by her wards of protection. With another command, the swordsmen attacked. Rushing in with blades drawn they cut into the energy shields surrounding the goddess. The Dream Scorcher laughed.</p>
      <p>A wave of her hand sent the attackers to their knees. Visions of unthinkable terror flowed into their minds, shattering their resolve. With no warning, spectral guardians of the nightmare queen rose to slay the paralyzed army. But strength found its way back into the attackers. They broke into groups, each battling the specters while another force remained upon the daughter of Cazic. Soon the specters were cut down and the attackers reunited on the goddess, filled once again with the fury of battle.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>Terris Thule's protections began to weaken. The blades and spells of the Cult cut deeper into her defenses. But the queen had one last defense. Far above her, the last guardians of the Dream Scorcher came to life. Stone demons crashed to the floor and stood, their thirty foot wings spreading out to the sky. The roars of the demons deafened the attackers. The demons crashed into the flanks of the attacking party, cutting into the groups of spellcasters like knives through paper. Dachunker, a powerful female troll warlord of the Cult, smashed the knee of one of the great beasts with two skull-headed maces. But another demon stabbed its claws through her back and out the front of her stomach. Blood poured from the warrior's mouth and she fell to the ground dead.</p>
      <p>Loral rushed forward to restore life to the fallen heroine but the hand of Maylay the Necromancer stopped him. With a smile to the Tunarian priest, he knelt down and touched the forehead of the troll. Dachunker's eyes grew dark but her body stirred. Dachunker stood, her wound still pouring forth lifeblood and gore. Terris Thule sent another wave of nightmarish visions into the walking corpse but they had no effect. Nightmares, it seemed, did little to deter the dead. The zombie dropped the twin maces she had been fighting with and from her back drew a sword Loral had last seen in a Shadowhaven bar - the Sword of Ssraeshza. Piercing through any remaining spells of protection, the troll stabbed hard and slammed it through Terris Thule's chest. Black blood poured to the floor as the goddess fell. The 5000 year old golden-runed sword had once again earned the name Godslayer.</p>
      
        
      
      <p>A powerful blow sent Loral sliding across the ground as the last of Terris Thule's guardians sought revenge. Loral attempted to call forth the protective prayers of Tunare but the last word caught in his throat as the fist of the demon slammed into him.</p>
      <p>Loral woke. A weight seemed to press down upon him as he sat upright. His eyes were filled with a red fog. He looked down to see he wore the yellow robes of a Tunarian acolyte. Standing upright took much effort but the vision surrounding him nearly sent him back to the ground. The world had changed. The red fog of his vision surrounded everything. Across a sea of blackness he could make out a floating island, a keep, suspended from an unknown ceiling by an enormous chain. For months Loral had studied the outer planes and he knew he was no longer in the Plane of Nightmares. If ever there was a place darker and more terrible, it was here - The Plane of Torment.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 32: Lxanvom</h2>
  
<p>It is with a quivering hand that I write my last words. At my feet lies my lord, the thirteenth Adan, king of our lands. My blade is buried in his back. His blood stains the hand that writes these words. It was the promise of great strength, whispered sweetly and softly to my ears over the years that has caused this to happen. Whispers of dreams and power realized. The dreams spoke of a ritual, glyphs and runes I have inscribed upon the floor of this place, the Kings Rest. It is irony that I am now hearing whispers of truth. I have betrayed my king and my people, the voice says, not as a revelation but as torment. I hear the hissing laughter of my new lord, the dark lord, the Plaguebringer. I hear his voice, tears falling from my betraying eyes as they look at the green portal that has opened. The voice grows louder. I have a new master now, it says. He is coming...</p>
      
        
      
<p>A large candle dripped wax onto an oak table while Loral read the ancient tome. The words had been written over four thousand years earlier, only having recently been translated by the scribes of Tanaan. Loral began studying the fall of Lxanvom, the King's Rest, after his adventures took him to its door in the Plane of Disease. He read of Bertoxxulous, the god of disease. For weeks he had been reading the texts, carefully turning the yellowed pages. Nothing took his attention away from the words of a culture long dead. The room grew hot. Loral looked up and saw the scribes of the library step back and out of the way as a small figure in red robes approached.</p>

<p>The room was illuminated by a red glow. Flames danced in Azile's black eyes behind the shadows of her hood. In her hand she held the Staff of the Four, an eternal flame burning at its top. Loral noticed for the first time that in their century of adventures together Azile hadn't aged a day. Azile would be almost one hundred and thirty, Loral calculated, though she looked hardly older than forty. Her eyes spoke of anything but youth. Her power had grown beyond any Loral had ever seen. He had watched her rip open rifts to the depths of the outer worlds and bring forth flames hotter than any known in the mortal world. She was no longer the simple traveler Loral had once known.</p>
      
        
      
<p>An unpleasant vision filled Loral's mind. He dreamed of the elder gods dead within their own worlds.  He saw armies of adventurers slaying the immortals of the outer planes and storming timeless keeps and castles. Visions of Fennin Ro's smouldering corpse lying upon the charred ground of Fire sending a column of black smoke into the air flashed in his mind. Above the corpse, floating upon a cloud of flame rose the new goddess of Fire - Azile the Scorcher.</p>

<p>Azile walked up to the table and sat down next to Loral. She smiled, pulled a small package from her pack, and put it down on the table. The smell of warm cake filled the air around him. Perhaps he was wrong. The vision must have been a trick of the light when she had entered. Too much reading of dramatic old texts, he thought.</p>

<p>"The Lotus has breached the Crypt of Decay," she stated. Loral looked at her unblinking eyes and beheld again the fiery vision.</p>
      
        
      
<p>Despite the cold darkness of the tomb, Loral felt sweat drip down his face. His eyes closed in silent meditation to Tunare, but the rhythmic chanting of the undead summoners could not be blocked out. For three days they had fought the undead of Lxanvom. Decayed husks of old priests and knights attacked with cracked lips pulled back over rotten jagged teeth. They had cut through the minions of the upper floors with little trouble, but when they entered the lower depths of the crypt they found a greater evil.</p>

<p>The summoners, undead priests of a lost age, called fourth the remains of the kings of Lxanvom. Torn from their rest and twisted into hideous forms, the kings attacked with strength and fury. They attacked with bloated fists and the pincers of enormous spiders. The sounds of thunder and the smells of burning flesh filled the crypt that had gone untouched for so many centuries. The blades of the Cult ripped into the kings and their minions, cutting through the material world and into the world of the tormented souls. One by one the evil forms of once great rulers fell.</p>
      
        
      
<p>All was quiet. The chanting of the undead priests became screams of death as they sacrificed themselves for a final summoning. The air became foul and cold. The group was silent as the Plaguebringer approached. His green burning eyes beheld them, the defilers of his temple. He reached towards them with a long thin arm ending in a claw with too many joints. The horror of the apparition in front of them held the adventurers as still as death.</p>

<p>A roar of fire broke the trance. The warriors screamed and charged in, blades held high. The clash of steel on hardened bone was deafening. Loral closed his eyes, calling upon the healing and protective magic of the Mother but Bertoxxulous had magic of his own. A dark grey mist flowed from the outstretched hands of the elder God. Loral felt his skin crack open. Sores began to appear and oozed a black liquid. All around him adventurers fell to their knees, their life energy being sapped out of them by the curse of Bertoxxulous.</p>
      
        
      
<p>A millennia earlier in lands long forgotten, the children of Veeshan created a weapon of incredible power. Using the skills of the greater wyrms, they forged a spear of prismatic energies capable of stabbing through the thickest scales the dragons had. It had been forged as a weapon for mortals to one day battle the Sleeper, Kerafyrm. Centuries later it had been discovered by an unlikely elf and on this day, it saved her from an unlikely enemy. With milky eyes and sunken cheeks, the rogue Annalyze reared back and threw the ancient spear into the back of Bertoxxulous's skull. With a deafening crack, the Plaguebringer's skull split and he crashed down to the ground.</p>

<p>A week later Loral was back in Tanaan, carefully turning another page from the tome that sat on the table. He took a bite from Azile's cake, feeling a warmth flow down his body. Though grey lines still crossed his face, the scars of Bertoxxulous's curse had almost completely healed. A deeper wound remained open however... a wounding of purpose. For a year, Loral had battled the beings of the planes, fighting for the safety of Faydwer and in the name of Tunare, but to what end? How far would he delve into these realms of uncertainty? For now, Loral could only ponder...and enjoy another piece of cake.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 33: Drundor</h2>
  
  <p>"The warriors of Zek are not finished with you. The fires of War are eternal. I shall return."</p>

  <p>The words from King Tormax echoed through Loral's head as he watched the frost giant lord die in the icy caverns of Kael Drakkal. For four years he had fought the giants of Kael. Loral had battled the frost giant general, Narandi, during the war of Thurgadin. He had destroyed the guardian of the church of Zek, Derakor the Vindicator. A hundred giants had fallen to Loral's companions. Still the spirit of war did not leave this powerful enemy. The Kromzek leader had fought a war on three fronts, battling Thurgadin, Skyshrine, and the Plane of Growth within the same year. Loral was no tactician but even his priestly mind knew how difficult such a campaign would be. All three enemies of the Kromzek continued to feel the sting of the giants' spears. Scores of Coldain were killed on the river banks of the Great Divide during Narandi's battle. Corpses of young dragons littered the Western Wastes, slain by the mercenaries of Kael. Loral had even found a spy deep within the inner halls of Skyshrine, cloaked and masked by the magic of the Kromzek priests.</p>

  <p>King Tormax lay dead but the sense of dread did not leave Loral. Outside stood the war machines of Kael aimed at the Plane of Growth. The war would be delayed but Loral doubted it had been stopped completely. The priests of Zek were powerful and the giant king would return to his dragon-skull throne. Only one path remained for Loral to follow. There was only one way to protect Tunare. He must remove Kael's resolve to fight. He must remove the source of their murderous spirit. He must face Rallos Zek.</p>

  
    
  

  <p>Ten years had passed since the battles of Kael. Loral sat at a small table in an inn of New Tanaan. Across from him sat a beautiful human female wrapped in red robes. Starkin the ranger walked into the bar and saw the venerable priest in his green robes speaking to her. She soon rose and walked out the door, smiling at Starkin as she left.</p>

  <p>"Who was the woman?" Starkin said as he sat down at Loral's table. "I do not recognize her."</p>

  <p>"Nor will you ever." Loral said with a smile. "I have met her perhaps a dozen times and each time she appears different. You could pass her again on your way out and not even know it."</p>

  <p>"One of the spies of your vast network?" Starkin said teasingly. "Certainly the church would not approve."</p>

  <p>"The Tier'Dal incorporate spies, my friend, I simply have contacts." Loral smiled and took a sip of wine from the crystal glass on his table. "Well informed contacts."</p>

  <p>His demeanor changed though when he remembered the tale of his friend, the enchantress. "The kingdom of Felwithe sent me here to locate threats to the elven nations," he spoke sternly. "The tools I use to fulfill that role are not of their concern. Perhaps the Church would not approve of my methods but they have not seen the dangers I have seen."</p>

  <p>Loral took two rolled parchments from his worn leather pouch. One held the wax seal of the Church of Tunare, the other the symbol of Healers United.</p>

  
    
  

  <p>"Zek has commissioned the construction of war machines from the gnomish tinkerers of Innovation. He already has an army of warriors and with these new machines he plans to invade Norrath. The model of the metal beast in Innovation was destroyed four days ago but I do not think that will dissuade Zek from his attack on our world. The priests of Kael will open a doorway to Drundor, the Fortress of Zek, and his army will march across Norrath."</p>

  <p>Starkin grew cold. He had seen one of his warriors, a Daiku it was called, in the desert of Storm. It took twelve adventurers to defeat the murderous beast. The creature appeared to be an ogre but with a speed, power, and sturdiness he had never seen in a mortal.</p>

  <p>"A portal has been opened to Drundor from the caves of Tranquility and a raiding party plans to infiltrate the fortress," Loral continued. "I plan on entering with them." Loral handed the two parchments to Starkin. "Please deliver the first to Yeolarn of the Church of Felwithe. The other should go to Juror." Loral rose and embraced his noble friend. "I will return with news soon." Starkin looked at Loral for the truth of that statement. Himself a veteran planewalker, Starkin the Warder knew that Drundor would offer little chance of escape.</p>

  <p>Two days later, Loral entered the Fortress of Zek.</p>

  <p>Norrath was a world of balance. Each element helped to off-set another. The outer planes had no such balance. Stepping foot into Drundor sent a feeling of murderous dread through Loral's skin. Rough stone floors fed into the metal plates of the walls. Steel torches burned harshly, blackening the walls around them. The clashing of steel upon steel, the howl of wild animals bred for war, the roars of triumph, and screams of pain all echoed throughout the halls. Though fifty members strong, the raiding party Loral accompanied felt small. There was no doubt in Loral's mind that he had entered a hall of death. There was no purpose for Drundor other than war.</p>

  
    
  

  <p>Two guards of the fortress, over 20 feet high and armored in steel stained with dirt and blood, saw the approaching raiding party. Without hesitation or nervousness, they drew shining blades from their scabbards and roared as they swung at the front lines, hoping to sever them in half. Thus began the many battles the adventurers faced in the Fortress of Zek.</p>

  <p>All throughout the fortress, the party met the forces of Zek's army. Every guardian of Zek was covered in scars and each fought with the experiences of centuries of combat. Loral imagined the devastation that would face the cities of Norrath as hundreds of these icons of battle stormed through, mercilessly cutting down everything in their path. For these warriors there had never been peace. There was no concept of love or happiness. There was only the smell of blood and the rush of victory.</p>

  
    
  

  <p>The party soon entered a large hall deep within the fortress. The torches burned low and Loral became aware that all had become quiet around them. A powerful warrior of the raiding party stepped in and drew his blade. From the quiet darkness soared a screaming arrow of flame. It struck the warrior and sent him flying through the air, slamming him against the back wall of the room. From the shadows stepped Tallon Zek, nocking another arrow into his ancient bow.</p>

  <p>The raiding party charged in to meet the demi-god. Tallon's 15 foot bow creaked and he let another arrow fly, this one blazing with ice. A mage caught the huge arrow in the chest and immediately fell dead, the four foot arrow still smoking in his chest. Steel rang against the god's armor as the party hacked at the diety of battle. Overwhelmed, Tallon spoke a word of command and fired another barbed arrow. The arrow split into three dozen smaller ones, each finding the mark of one of his attackers. Those hit by the barbed arrows flew back and were pinned to the walls of the hall. The shouts of battle became the cries of the dying as arrow after arrow left Tallon's unholy bow. But the attackers were filled with resolve.</p>

  <p>The healing energy of Tunare flowed from Loral's hands, mending the gaping holes of the evil arrows. Calling upon the strength of the Mother, Loral raised his hands and a shower of blue lights quietly embraced the raiding force. The light enveloped the adventurers near him, mending their wounds and renewing their spirit. The party regrouped and attacked again. This time Tallon Zek fell to their blades.</p>

  
    
  

  <p>Loral stood over the body of the son of Zek. Many of the party tended to the injured and to those fallen in the battle. Others sorted through the treasures found in the hall. Loral could only look at the corpse at his feet and wonder when this would end. The fortress around them continued to bustle with activity. Zek's army was far from defeated. Loral felt old. How far he had gone in the name of Felwithe. How many enemies had he uncovered. How distant he was from his home.</p>

  <p>Leaning heavily on his silver-headed hammer, Loral walked forward. His armor felt heavier than before, pressing deeply in permanent creases on his shoulders. The memories of Coldain blood staining the snow of Velious returned to him as he headed back into the depths of Drundor.</p>

  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 34: The Warlord</h2>
  
<p>Jalen had been guarding the gates of Felwithe longer than any human had lived. His blade had seen no fewer than five hundred orc necks in his two hundred years of service. He had been guarding the Koada'dal city since it had been founded.  As 
unexpected as it was, he died as he had always hoped, defending the 
city of the elves.</p>

    <p>The guardian of Felwithe never felt the ethereal blade cut through his steel armor and sink into his back. The Daiku Hendin, Gandulak, let the blade slip free as the body of the high elf fell to the ground. Gandulak's face betrayed no emotion as he looked with white pupil-less eyes towards the gates of Felwithe. The ogre pulled his cloak tighter around his large frame and faded back into the darkness. The assassin peered out from under the black hood, his tattooed face hardly visible. In a few hours, the king of Felwithe would be returning from Kelethin. Then Gandulak would strike. The king would be well guarded but none upon the mortal world had seen the skills of a Hendin, a master assassin of Zek. He had no doubt that he would be able to dispose of any guards who might stand in his way. He had no doubt that the king of Felwithe would die this day.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>Loral's vision of the demonic assassin shattered as a War Wraith tore into the priest's party. The cowl on the beast's face made Loral wonder what horror was being hidden that could possibly be worse than the rest of the demon's body. Loral was shocked back into the present when a swing of Moegid's axe 
severed the beast's head from its body with machine-like precision. A shower of thick black blood sprayed against the wall as the corpse fell to the stone floor. The ring of the steel axe echoed down the corridors of Drundor.</p>

    <p>At the top of a large stone staircase, the war party engaged the Daiku 
Hendin Shadowmasters. Armed and armored in black metal forged from the 
mountains of the Plane of War, the Hendin attacked with the power of 
the giants of Kael who lived deep within Kael and also with the dexterity 
and accuracy of the finest elven swordmasters. Each swing led into three more, each feint led to a riposte that had their opponents clutching at their open bellies or slashed throats. Their white eyes burned with the thrill of combat but they never succumbed to the rage of a typical warrior.  Only with the solid coordination of powerful warriors and the combined efforts of many spellwielders were the powerful guardians destroyed.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>The adventurers were ragged when he struck.Some leaned heavily on their blades while others sat against the walls. A chill was felt throughout the party. An elven ranger narrowed his eyes and turned towards the dark hallway as a wind flowed past. A black blade burst through his chest. The blade pulled out and cut across, severing the ranger in half to the horror of his companions. Behind the cloud of blood was the grinning face of Vallon Zek, the master of assassins. A bombardment of arrows raced towards the god but before they landed, his visage split into five. Each acting independently, the shades of Vallon cut through the adventurers.</p>

    <p>Loral watched in horror as powerful warriors were carved into pieces before his healing light could keep them alive. In a well coordinated feint, the adventurers focused their attacks on each shade in turn while the others were led down the dark corridors by quickfooted druids. One by one the shades were cut down by the raiding party. Finally, with teeth clenched in vengeance, another ranger of Tunare fired two arrows into the eyes of the son of Zek. The god fell to his knees and then face down onto the stone floor.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>A great roar of anger rumbled through the fortress, numbing the bones of the adventurers and rattling their teeth. The mightiest warriors' knees went weak, hearing the immortal voice of war.</p>

    <p>From deep within the center of the fortress was the first arena ever created. A den of combat, only the best warriors had ever been tested there and few of these ever stepped out. The raiders floated down onto the sandy floor with spells of levitation. The stench of centuries of decay tainted the air and the roaring flame of Rallos Zek's axe lit the arena. The warriors of the Cult stepped 
forward - Dachunker, Grongl, Slivereyes, Torray, and Tera - all representatives 
of different cultures but all the mightiest warriors of Norrath.</p>

    <p>Bright red eyes of hate flared from within the black helm. His body was built from the blood of armies. His burning axe had been forged from the combined rage of one hundred thousand battles. Time slowed down for Loral as Zek's black boots cracked the stone under the sandy floor. With a huge throw, the burning axe soared. With a ring of steel on steel, the head of a human paladin tumbled through the air, a pinwheel of blood in its wake. Loral began chanting in time with six other clerics. A steady stream of healing energy filled the warriors, closing wounds that the horrible axe opened.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>Loral gained confidence as the battle raged on. While the black armor turned almost every attack, many hit home. The healing waves of Loral and the other clerics flowed, keeping the attacking warriors alive. The sizzling blasts of fire and ice pelted the God of War. The battle was in their favor, until the dead returned to life.</p>

    <p>Loral felt the ground under his feet break open. A rotting claw wrapped in a tarnished silver gauntlet reached out of the ground. All around the arena beasts tore free from the ground around them. Giant boars armored in gold burst through the rear lines of the war party. A score of the winged beasts they had battled earlier dove in, claws tearing into flesh. Quickly the creatures were rallied, taunted, and led astray by the arrows and spells of a rear guard. The slayer of Vallon Zek fired arrow after arrow, piercing the thick hide of a boar and tearing holes in the wings of the war wraiths.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>The burning axe spun in the air around the God of War. The blades of the warriors cut deep under his armor. Black blood flowed from a thousand wounds. The female troll, Dachunker, crushed Rallos Zek's knee with a skull headed heavily enchanted mace. He came down hard on one leg and the keen blade of Slivereyes's sword found the edge of a plate and plunged deep into the Warlord's skull. The fortress went silent. The risen beasts stopped their assault and turned towards their master. The impossible had happened. Slivereyes pulled his blade free from the helm and cut again at the God's neck almost severing the head from its shoulders. The red eyes flashed one last time and then went out. The burning axe, still spinning in the air, plunged into the ground 
with a crack of thunder.Rallos Zek the Warlord had been killed.</p>

    <p>Gandulak felt a psychic scream split his mind. Only his thousand years of training kept him from crying out. Something horribly wrong had happened. Twenty other Hendin, all poised outside of Norrath's cities, heard the same cry. Thousands of miles away the giant priests of Zek fell dead, blood streaming from their ears. Gandulak's skin grew cold. Something horrible had occurred within his home world. He drew a small ruby from within the folds of his cloak. He crushed the gem and blew the fragments into the air. A tear in the fabric of space created a doorway back to the Plane of War. Gandulak stepped into the rift and it snapped shut behind him. A minute later King Thearsis Thex came back from his meeting with the council of Kelethin, completely oblivious to the danger that had once stood only a few feet away.</p>

    <p>Loral awoke just before dawn in the inn of New Tanaan. The fragments of his dream slipped away as his eyes took in the room's furnishings. He pulled the thick blanket tighter around him and let his eyes close. The king of Felwithe was safe as were the other leaders of Norrath's people. Rallos Zek had been slain and his assassins had retreated. Loral could afford another hour of sleep.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 35: The Tower of Ro</h2>
  
<p>It was three hundred and fifty years before the Age of Wonder and Tunaria burned.  Tarlin and his band of fifty rangers marched solemnly but quickly through Kithicor on their way north to Telethin.  They could already see the red smoke in the sky.  Fayspires was on fire.  They stepped out onto what was once rich and grassy lands but now was lifeless rock and ash.  It was on these burnt lands that the elves faced Solusek's demons.</p>

<p>They felt the ground rumble under their feet and the air filled with waves of heat as a massive form approached.  Grezou came upon them on twenty foot wings, his body rippling with muscles and smoking with an internal flame.  He opened his clawed hand and a cone of fire incinerated two of Tarlin's companions.  Holding their ground, the other rangers raised their bows and fired waves of arrows enchanted with ice.  Steam rose from a dozen wounds but the red demon was not finished.</p>

<p>Sixteen more companions were killed before the beast was sent back to the Plane of Fire.  While the troops regrouped and mended their horrible burns, Tarlin stood on a charred hill overlooking the valley that had once been Telethin.  He brushed away a dirty lock of blonde hair that stuck to the grime and sweat of his brow.  Large red shapes dotted the once lush countryside that was now a wasteland of ash.  Tarlin's heart sank. Two hundred more demons remained.  It was Takish Hiz all over again.</p>
  
    
  
<p>The Planes were alien to Loral in every way.  For a year he had traveled the planes and he felt himself changing mentally and physically.  His armor had shifted around him changing hue from deep blue to gold.  His summoned hammer, Daninulaer the Wraithsbane, pulsed with life in his hand.  Loral felt his grasp on the physical laws of nature slip the further he traveled into the Planes.  His time in the Tower of Solusek Ro was no exception.</p>

<p>Giant stone walkways stood suspended over huge chasms of lava.  Hallways forged from thousands of tons of iron twisted and turned throughout the demonic lair.  Teleportation crystals sent the Norrathian adventurers deeper into the tower, removing all sense of bearing and navigation.  There was nowhere to travel but up, further into the hands of the Burning Prince.  Loral caught a glimpse through a crack in the wall of the outside world.  He became dizzy when he saw the ocean of lava that surrounded the black tower for hundreds of miles.  His mind cleared when he heard the attack of the first of Solusek Ro's guardians.</p>
  
    
  
<p>The demon Xuzl sat within his black hall and waited. For six hundred years, he had remained within the giant iron tower of Solusek Ro, rising like a black needle in the center of the Plane of Fire.  After six hundred years, he remembered the taste of mortals. Although he would now face mortals again, it was not on their land.  It was on his own.</p>

<p>Xuzl stood to his full twenty four foot height and stretched his giant wings to the edges of his hall.  Outside he could hear his minions in battle.  The clash of steel and the blasts of flame flashed through his doorway.  Soon the intruders entered.  He recognized their races from his short stay on Norrath.  All the races were represented, it seemed, armed and armored with great treasures to fill his vaults and arm his own troops.  Xuzl was not a stupid creature, however.  He knew that no ordinary mortals could penetrate this deep into the 
tower of the elder god, Solusek Ro. He knew the strength of the guardians 
these adventurers had defeated.</p>
  
    
  
<p>Two green eyes suspended in blackness were the first signs of this 
mighty foe the mortals glimpsed.  Then the room exploded into orange light as walls of fire roared to life.  Xuzl raised his claw into the air sending waves of fire through the war party.  Only the protective magics of their druids saved them from the searing heat.  Loral ducked behind his shield and felt the enchanted steel melt under the waves of flame.  The adventurers returned the attack firing dozens of enchanted arrows and magical spears of ice onto the beast.  Xuzl's own protective magics stopped many of the attacks, but some pierced his thick hide.</p>

<p>Any conversations among the minions of Solusek Ro's tower ceased when they heard the roar of Xuzl.  A demon among demons, none dared to challenge the creature. He was one of the five guardians of the Burning Prince himself and kept company only with those he commanded.  To hear the beast's cry of agony and rage put fear into the mightiest of Solusek's guardians.</p>
  
    
  
<p>The smouldering corpse of Xuzl lay on the stone platform of his lair.  His mouth was twisted in agony and anger, bearing horrible fangs.  Loral eyes were fixed on the slain demon.  Many such creatures remained but for a party of mortals to enter the realm of Solusek himself and defeat such a foe was incredible.  Loral felt a twinge of doubt and trouble within the back of his mind.</p>

<p>Binedina stepped forward and handed Loral a round silver shield found in the demon's treasures.  Loral dropped his own ruined shield and slipped this new one onto his arm.  The roar of Xuzl's final death echoed within Loral's ears and the circular shield blazed with fire and then grew still.  A powerful item indeed, Loral thought, and bowed to thank Binedina for her generosity.  She smiled in return and the war party moved on.</p>

<p>Within the highest spire of the tower, at the tip of the spike within the world of lava, Solusek Ro stood.  There was a threat within his home.  His demonic sentinel had been killed. Solusek Ro summoned his remaining guardians close and ordered the remaining four sentinels to stand ready. Solusek, the Burning Prince, felt a sensation he hadn't felt for a thousand years - Fear.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 36: Solusek Ro</h2>
  
    <p>The final day of the elven city of Fayspires was approaching. The ancient trees of Telethin burned like giant torches, filling the sky with black smoke. Outside of the city, the armies of Tunaria battled the demons of Ro. Inside, the last sages of Fayspires concentrated their powers on the large blue shell that encompassed the city.</p>

    <p>Waves of fire and bolts of electricity bounced off of the protective shell. Then Rizlona entered the wizards guild and all was lost. Once known as a bard with songs that soothed the most troubled heart, the elven woman had been in seclusion for weeks before the gates of Fire had opened. For weeks Solusek Ro whispered to the bard, tempting her with powers and riches beyond any Rizlona had ever known. When she awoke this morning she found a white multi-faceted gem in the center of her floor. The last dark words of her dream rang in her ears. "Take the Dresolik to the wizards."</p>

    
      
    

    <p>The eyes of the wizards snapped open when they felt the burning artifact enter their room.Before they could react, the gem flashed and a guardian of Fire appeared in the middle of the wizards' circle. The demon was black faced with red burning eyes and held a double-bladed glyphed axe.Elven magic exploded and blood sprayed on the white marble walls as the last defenses of Fayspires collapsed.</p>

    <p>Rizlona was given a place as a guardian of Solusek Ro in his black tower deep within the Plane of Fire. For five hundred years, her powers grew within her dark chamber. It was within that chamber that she now faced the vengeance of the elves. It was within that chamber that she faced the vengeance of the elves. She was reminded of the last days of Fayspires when she heard the roars of battle just outside her door.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>Few had ever seen a horror greater than that of the demon Grezou. Older than the mountains of Kunark, he attacked with a ferocity of pure hatred. Beams of energy shot from his emerald eyes and claws ripped through enchanted armor like paper. The blades of the warriors of the Cult cut deep but the beast was relentless. Calling upon the powers of his home plane of Fire, Grezou reached his arms high. His chanting was interrupted by a blast of absolute cold that tore through the massive chest of the greater demon. Loral turned to see an icy glimmer in Azile's eyes before they returned to normal. Loral shuddered.</p>

    <p>Covered in ash and soot, the raiding party entered Rizlona's chambers. Loral was shocked to see the elven woman armored in gold. His surprise intensified as his companions attacked the woman and she showed her true form.</p>

    <p>Solusek Ro had given many gifts to Rizlona for her part in the destruction of Fayspires. None was more powerful than her new body. Rizlona fell to her hands and knees. Her back arched and elongated. Claws sprang from her finger tips as she grew many times her size. Her armor fell away revealing a thick gold hide of scales. The cracking of bones refitting and reforming made Loral shiver. Huge batlike wings spread above the raiding force. When she raised her head again, Loral stared in shock at the head of a huge golden dragon.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>Rizlona breathed and a huge column of lava engulfed the front lines of the raiders. Blue rings of protective magic kept the party alive if not unharmed. The party attacked. Powerfully enchanted blades and waves of magical powers ripped into the dragon. Though it felt as if it lasted for days, the battle lasted only a few minutes before the betrayer of Fayspires fell dead.</p>

    <p>Each of the five guardians of Solusek Ro had been defeated. A silence fell over the tower. Bubbling lava and creaking steal were the only sounds as the war party stood in front of the pillar of flame, the gateway to Solusek's antechamber.</p>

    <p>Solusek Ro stood on the raised platform of his throne room. His remaining minions stood with him, horribly powerful protectors feared by Norrath's eldest dragons.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>Loral thought back to the stories of the exodus of Tunaria. He remembered the cold eyes of his father when Tarlin retold the sad tale. Thousands of elves had died, many of starvation and exposure to the harsh ocean of Tears. While the strongest of the elven armies died upon the fields of Northern Tunaria, many of the sick, the elderly, and the children of the elves died in travel to Faydwer. So weakened were the elves that they had been threatened with extinction at the hands of the Crushbone orcs.</p>

    <p>It was the jealousy and greed of this spoiled child of Fire that taught the elves the meaning of true sadness. The vengeance of Tunaria fed every elf who ever picked up a sword or cast a spell. On this day, vengeance was sated. Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince, was killed within his own lair. Across the Plane of Fire, one last flash of brilliant light from the top of the needle spire of his tower could be seen.</p>

    <p>Loral stood staring at the smoldering corpse of Ro. His hammer, Daninulaer, still hummed in his hand. An unintelligible voice whispered within his mind. The weight of his actions began to sink in. Rallos Zek the Warlord had been killed, protecting Growth from the assault of the frost giants of Kael Drakkal. Solusek Ro, destroyer of Tunaria, had been destroyed, avenging the death of thousands. All across the outer planes, gods, demigods, and their armies had been hunted and killed.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>Somewhere within the chambers of Ro, a gnome of the raiding party found a lever opening a pit of burning lava. Darkweb the wizard recognized it as a gateway, perhaps deeper into the Plane of Fire.</p>

    <p>Loral stared into the burning pit. He could return to Felwithe this day. He could spend every day from now on in peace, knowing Felwithe was safe. Loral looked deeper into the gateway. There was no logical reason to continue. He had served Tunare more than any had ever expected. There was no need to face further unknown horrors. A single prayer and the powers of the Faithstone of Nature would return him home. Entering the gate would send him to dangers beyond any known by mortals. The laughter of Xuzl the demon echoed in the back of Loral's mind.</p>

    <p>Loral jumped into the pit of Fire.</p>
  
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 37: Fire</h2>
  
<p>There are ways to try to wrap the mortal mind around the Planes of Power but all of them fail to grasp the entire picture.  Some view the Planes as a scale, with Norrath at the center and the planes spreading down to each end.  The further down one side you travel, the more extreme the Planes become.  On one side you have Innoruuk's domain, the Plane of Hate.  On the other is the realm of Tunare, the Plane of Growth.</p>

<p>Others see the Planes as a great sphere surrounding us. If we start at the center of this sphere, we see planes similar to our own world of Norrath.  The Plane of Knowledge and its stones of travel, for example, resemble many cities of Norrath.  This pocket-world, however, makes it possible to travel from Halas to Felwithe with fifteen foot steps.  It shortens the distances between two points in our world as if folding our lands to bring these two points together.  Yet the Plane of Knowledge is little different than our own, though it would seem to have encapsulated all of Norrath in a single walled city.  If we look at a further layer we begin to see extremes.  The Plane of Valor and its garrisons of immortal paladins sit on one side, forged in eternal battles against the chaotic beasts of the Glasslands.  The Plane of Torment and its eternal willingness to torture all inside for an eternity rots on the other.  One is unable to see where the black chains that hold up the eternal cells of Torment lead.  Perhaps there are no chains.</p>

<p>In the furthest of these layers known to us are the elements.  Their deities are beyond our comprehension of good or evil.  They serve our world at its most fundamental layers.  How would we choose to align water when it both feeds our crops with rain or destroys our cities in floods?  How do we choose to fit fire into our primitive beliefs when it keeps our children warm at night or sends armies screaming into the abyss?  And how can we possibly comprehend these worlds were we to visit them?  Is our mind able to even attach images onto what we might fix our eyes upon?  Do we stretch ourselves beyond our own boundaries of reality by even stepping foot inside?  We may never know.  One can only wonder what our mortal lives would face in such levels of extremity.  And one can only wonder what lies beyond.</p>

<p>- Maelin Starpyre, Grand Librarian of Myrist</p>

<p>The air cracked and the portal opened, sucking the hot air of Fire back through.  Loral fell, landing hard on one knee and a hand placed out to balance himself. His eyes were closed.  The air around him singed his skin but the heavy enchantments on his armor protected him from what otherwise would have burned his skin off his bones.  Slowly he looked up and opened his eyes to behold the outer world around him.  What he saw almost sent him into shock.</p>
    
      
    
<p>Eternal flames scorched the sky.  The volcanic mountains towered around him, streams of lava pouring from their peaks.  Huge ancient trees burned like a thousand candles over the charred ground in front of him.  From within the dense burning forest he could see the movements of living flame and he could hear the clicking of many legs on the hard cracked ground.  There were enemies about and Loral had no doubt that should they discover him, they would kill him.</p>

<p>A hand gripped Loral's coif and hoisted him off of his feet.  Shaken, he turned and saw the smile and shining eyes of Tera the swordswoman of Halas.  Many battles he had faced with the powerful yet graceful bladewielder, some deep within the Halls of Testing, the ancient temple of the dragons of Velious.  The air cracked again and with a crash of steel on rock stood a monument of power, Grongl the Warlord.  He leaned on the sharp Blade of War and stood.  Three long but sure strides took him to the top of a large obsidian rock.  There he beheld the burning lands of Doomfire.  He sneered.  Loral had little doubt that the General was more at home in these horrid lands than anywhere on Norrath.  The powerful troll leaned the long curved blade on his shoulder and turned.  A cheer from the other members of Lotus Cult flowed across the lands as Grongl held the blade high and pointed it to the north.  From behind the crowd, Binedina and her advisors smiled.  The battle was on.</p>
    
      
    
<p>The raiding party moved along the volcanic mountains around the burning forest and to a river of lava.  A great wall split the lands in half, guarded by dozens of Fennin's guardians.  Their burning spears glittered in the dark smoke.  The raiding party floated onto the upper platforms and in a score of fierce battles they breached the walls and approached the dark side of the burning lands, closer to the city of Fennin Ro.</p>

<p>The party met the minions of Fennin Ro in force.  Huge elemental flames, hundreds of times stronger than those that walked Norrath, unleashed waves of lava over the warriors.  All about the skies were great winged demons, the fire reflecting off of their thick red skin.  Some were as large as the guardian, Xuzl.  Some were even larger.</p>
    
      
    
<p>The horrible sounds of Doomfire grew quiet as they approached a narrow bridge suspended over a chasm of lava.  Six scouts moved forward, their eyes peering into the smoke ahead.  Without warning, a twelve foot spike, pierced through the chest of their leader, pinning him to the ground.  Out of the smoke came an vision out of Loral's deepest nightmares, Babnoxis the Spider Queen.  Over thirty feet high and almost ninety feet across from her massive legs, the giant spider roared down upon the party.  Arrows skimmed across her thick black shell and the spider countered with streams of venom from shining fangs.  A dreadful scream filled the heads of the raiders, the ancient voice of the spider queen, spewing forth malice and terror in a language five thousand years dead.  Loral felt a rage build inside him.  He held his hand towards the black demon-queen and called upon Tunare's Condemnation.</p>

<p>The roar of Xuzl filled Loral's head as energy poured out of his hand and blasted into the thick shell.  The shell cracked and Babnoxis screamed in Loral's mind, bringing him to his knees.  Loral heard the laugh of Xuzl behind the scream of Babnoxis, the shield burning upon Loral's arm.  Loral clenched his jaw and stood to behold the battle.  The enchanted blades of the Cult, forged in the outer planes themselves, cut deep into the joints of Babnoxis's living armor. With a final cry to her lord, the ancient beast fell dead.</p>
    
      
    
<p>A voice boomed out across the burning lands and the council of flame was unleashed.  The greatest of Fennin's creation, the inner circle of Fennin's most powerful and loyal demons, roared to life and fell in from the burning sky.  Falling back to a narrow bridge, the war party faced each of the demons in turn.  Azobian the Darklord, Blazzax the Omnifiend, Hebabbilys the Ragelord, Javonn the Overlord, Reaxnous the Chaoslord, and Omni Magus Crato attacked the party one by one in two horrible hours of battle.  Columns of flame could be seen for miles.  The thick obsidian ground broke apart swallowing and crushing those unfortunate enough to step near.  Loral clutched his symbol of Tunare close, sending beams of healing light onto the fallen when he could.  All about him the battle raged.</p>

    
      
    

<p>The war party never broke ranks.  Each member protected the next as the horrible beasts attacked.  The perfect synergy of magic power, enchanted steel, icy arrows, and blue waves of life was beyond the chaotic strategies of Fennin's high council.  With a final spear of ice ripping through the torso of the great Omni Magus, the final arch demon fell dead.  Deep in his chambers of burnt stone, Fennin Ro stood alone.  The war party approached.</p>

<p>Two weeks passed.  Loral sat at a great oak table in the library of Tanaan, reading over the memoirs of Maelin Starpyre.  Fennin Ro, elder god of Fire, had been killed.  While the rush of victory was hard to suppress, Loral could not help but feel a coming darkness.  He remembered the speakings of Ciric, his Erudite mentor, about balance and the complementary relationships of the gods.  How could the balance of Norrath be sound when such a great force had been slain?  As if in reply, Loral felt the shield leaning against his chair grow hot.  The grating laughter of Xuzl hissed in the back of Loral's mind.  Loral would return to Qeynos to speak with Ciric on these matters, but Loral had one more conversation to have first - a conversation with a demon.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 38: Xuzl</h2>
  
    <p>The room was small, no more than twelve feet across, with a desk, a rug, and a bed. On a chair opposite the door was the artifact, covered with a black cloth. Loral's eyes never left the object as he closed and bolted the door. Loral couldn't help but wonder if it was the last time he would ever see the outside world again.</p>
    <p>With a small knife, Loral carved runes of protection into the wood of the door and into the supporting beams. He used the dust of crushed peridots and globes of summoned water to make a shimmering paste that he filled into the carved runes. A prayer to his goddess and a wave of his hand made the runes shine with an internal light. Loral prayed again, this time surrounding his body with a magical shell of protection from both physical, mental, and elemental attacks. He did not know what he might face in this encounter, it was best to be prepared. With his protection spells in place, Loral was ready.</p>
    <p>Loral pulled back the cloth and revealed the circular shield. It appeared dull and scarred from thousands of battles. It was an artifact of the Plane of Fire, a shield that held magical powers beyond the understanding of mortals. It had been forged before the existence of man or elf, a weapon of power in a war long past. There was something deeper, however. During its last battle the shield had captured a piece of the spirit it once protected. Loral closed his eyes and began to speak.</p>
    <p>"Awaken, Xuzl." Loral felt a flash of heat as the shield came alive. Loral imagined the shield expanding into a gateway, its oily surface appearing as a black liquid. A red claw extended out. A blast of hot sulphuric air blew Loral's hair back. He could feel the beast enter the room, over two thousand pounds of muscled hatred and fire.</p>
    <p>Loral heard the thud of Xuzl's hoof hitting the wooden floor. He felt the mass of the beast all around him. The floor seemed to sink under the demon's weight. Loral heard leather wings unfold around him, filling the entire room. He could smell the beast's burning breath beating down on him. Through his closed eye lids he could see the burning green eyes of Solusek's guardian. In a basement of a bar in Felwithe Loral sat in front of one of the most dangerous creatures ever to step foot upon Norrath.</p>
    <p>Xuzl's voice boomed. "At last we speak, elf. I wondered when this moment would occur." Xuzl laughed, a sound mixed of screaming children and steel scratching on stone. Loral could feel Xuzl's mind probing into Loral's, seeking control.</p>
    <p>"Stand down, Xuzl." Loral spoke, putting as much strength into his voice as he could. "I know what you are and I have seen your powers before. You shall not have control over me." Loral held his hand up revealing the black oval scar on his palm - a scar it the shape of an eye. "I have been possessed before, demon. I have tasted the breath of evil from my own mouth and I shall not taste it again."</p>
    <p>Xuzl considered the scar for a moment. "A beast of Innoruuk gave you this," the demon spoke with a voice both deep and gratingly sharp. "The Prince of Hate never had much patience. Your resistance to me is no concern. In time, priest, you will feel the strength I can give to you and perhaps you will see things differently."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps I should toss you into the pits of Lavastorm."</p>
    <p>Xuzl laughed. "Perhaps some red-skinned goblin would find me there. Perhaps his mind would not be as strong as your own and perhaps I would be released faster than I thought." Loral felt his heart sink at the demon's logic.</p>
    <p>"I am a patient one, priest." Xuzl continued, "I have many powers to give and many tales to tell. I will not lie to you as Innoruuk's fiend did. It is far more entertaining to watch you burn by your own twisted truth."</p>
    <p>"And what truth is that?"</p>
    <p>"The truth that you do more to damage your world than you do to protect it. Do you think you've saved Norrath by killing Fennin Ro? Do you think no one will take the throne? Can you not see the great imbalance you have created? The Planes are a scale, pasty elf, and you just took all of the weight off of one side. It is only a matter of time before the world crumbles around you." Again came the steel-scraping laugh.</p>
    <p>"I have tasted the blood of your grandfather, elf." Xuzl's heat grew as he spoke. "I heard him scream out to a goddess that would not listen when I ripped him in half and crushed his skull in my teeth. A thousand of your kind I have killed, but your own self destruction may be the most entertaining death I have seen."</p>
    <p>"Perhaps, demon. But for now you will serve the will of Tunare. You will serve as my hand, as I serve as hers. And when your time of service is up, I will return you to your fiery pits with the other vermin that infest your world."</p>
    <p>Loral opened his eyes. The room felt no different than it had when he first entered. The demon was gone. The scarred shield sat quietly across from him. Loral picked it up and slipped it onto his arm, feeling its warmth.</p>
    <p>Loral considered the danger of such an item.  To have the voice of one so versed in the ways of the outer planes was a benefit beyond measure, even if the voice was so foul as Xuzl's. If the will of Tunare is served and the protection of the elves is sound, the methods may not be questioned. It would not be the first time Loral had fought next to the hand of darkness in order to serve the greater good and it would not be the last.</p>
    <p>Loral climbed up the steps of the bar's basement and into the city of Felwithe. The demon sat comfortably on his arm.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 39: Torment</h2>
  
<p>From the worn leather-bound journal of Loral Ciriclight buried on a shelf of infinite books in New Tanaan</p>

    
      
    

<p>It was 3168 in the Age of Turmoil.  Only a few months earlier we found that all of Norrath's lands had been folded closer, connected to they planar city of New Tanaan in the Plane of Knowledge.  I remember how strange and wonderful it was traveling a short twelve steps between Felwithe and Halas, a trip that took six weeks by foot and boat.  Now these portals have entrenched themselves into every aspect of our society, changing a thousand years of culture and economics by the removal of geographical boundaries.  How quickly we have accepted these planar gateways and now treat them as a dirt path through the woods or an oak wheel on a cart.  They are commonplace to us now and few of us can ever recall the world without them.</p>

<p>Now powerful adventurers have entered the Plane of Time.  What changes will we find as hunters and treasure seekers begin tugging on the strings that tie together our past and future?  The swing of an enchanted blade may sever the chain our very existence or release horrors beyond imagination.  How can we possibly understand the ramifications of our actions?  The life of a quarter of a million Erudites could be snuffed out like the flame of a candle.</p>

<p>Why do we go?  I find myself asking this question often.  Is it the will of Tunare?  In the great balance of the outer planes, her realm and the hells of nightmare and disease cannot threaten each other.  Is it the will of the church and the safety of Felwithe?  I doubt the demons of these deep planes could comprehend such an intrusion.  We cannot be sure the demonkind could survive in our world at all.  The pollen of a flower may be as toxic to them as Trakanon's breath is to us.  Is it the thrill of adventure that pushes us to these outer worlds?  After seeing the darkness within some of these terrible places, one must question the sanity of such a motivation.</p>

    
      
    

<p>Few questions in life have simple answers.  Many variables drive our actions.  I cannot say why my friends and I entered the Plane of Torment but whatever the reasons, there we were.</p>

<p>I had seen the world of the banished in a vision some months previous, but I was unprepared for the feeling of sheer hopelessness as we beheld the horrible world.  There are very real dangers in this prison world but it is the mental terror that is the most dangerous.  Were it not for my stout friends, Stonehewer, Semidil, Kabbal, Juror, Vuldar, and Norque, I would have fled as soon as my eyes beheld the blood red sky and black sea.</p>

<p>The air in torment was thick and hot.  Though breathable, our bodies revolted with each forced breath, rejecting the smell and taste of blood and decay.  Faint screams, moans, and unsettling laughter rolled across the black water.  The cells of Torment, rooms suspended from chains that led up into the red haze of the infinite sky, held beasts older than Norrath.  Demons who spend their days within their own insanity, hating all life itself and wishing for the destruction of all life including their own.  With trepidation our party took our first steps onto the first of hundreds of suspended walkways.</p>

<p>The deafening scream of the bloodravens was our first welcome to this hell.  The psychic attack drowned out any ability to call upon our magical powers.  The beasts flew on oily black wings.  They stared at us with bloody eye-less sockets and filled our minds with visions of endless terror.  They ripped into our skin with a power and ferocity far beyond their size.  While our magical powers were limited, the blades of Stonehewer, Kabbal, and Semidil quickly cut down the demonic birds, their screaming fading along with whatever life force they had.</p>

<p>Within the mental screams of the eyeless bloodravens I heard the laughter of Xuzl.  The demonic entity trapped in my shield showed me just how unprepared we mortals were to even think we could understand what we were seeing.  The demon projected his feelings of elation woven into the thicker fabric of horror.  Even with his tauntings, his protections saved my life.</p>

    
      
    
		
<p>The Kaniz Hunter and Boruk Ravager made up for their lack of subtlety with pure physical power.  Like most creatures of the outer planes, their crude language was intermixed with telepathic visions of their intent to rip off our limbs and feast on our blood.  To feel the pleasure these unholy beasts felt at the thought or our own torture is a mental paradox beyond what mortal minds should face.  To see ones self as so alien a being is terrible indeed.</p>

<p>Thank Tunare that their physical forms were natural enough for blades and spells to combat.  Kabbal's great axe cut into the hoof of one, breaking the bone at an odd angle above its twisted backwards knee.  Far from defeated, the beast sunk its claws deep into Kabbal's thigh ripping into flesh and muscle.  My own prayers to Tunare sealed the mortal wound and Stonehewer's blazing greatsword beheaded the demon.</p>

    
      
    

<p>With the finest elven swordsmanship, Semidil plunged his blades into the second demon's chest to the hilt.  Semidil stared at the blazing red eyes of the demon, expecting the massive creature to fall over dead.  The Boruk Ravager laughed and punched the warrior in the face, sending him skidding across the stone walkway.  A barrage of magic assaulted the creature, waves of poisons, disease, and clouds of darkness engulfed it as both Juror and Norque chanted.  The red eyes went white as blindness took over the demon.  Stonehewer promptly beheaded the second beast, seeming to prefer this method of dispatching the demons of Torment.</p>

<p>We traveled for four days along the suspended walkways of the prison world.  Succumbing to curiosity, I ventured close to one of these buildings and what I saw made me wish I had not.  I do not know how demons come to exist, whether simply created by their god or perhaps the manifestation of imperfections in our own world.  I do know that no natural force could have created the Constructs.  The beast was a mass of pulsating veiny flesh.  It dragged its weight with a number of swollen tentacles, each ending in a mouth lined with needle-like teeth.  It had no visible eyes, but three of the larger tentacles turned my way and I heard a gurgling hiss.  With uncanny speed for such an unwieldy beast the hideous creation attacked and it wasn't alone.</p>

    
      
    

<p>Kabbal severed three of the hideous mouthed tentacles from the beast with a swing of his axe.  Daninulaer, my summoned hammer, smashed in the skull of another wolf-headed demon.  A third, seeing it was out numbered, grabbed Semidil by his chain tunic and in a flash of black light, the two disappeared.  Two more demons roared in and with the tentacle Construct still quite alive, our luck had run out.</p>

<p>Our astral lines snapped tight as the claws ripped into us.  The lines dragged our spiritual projections back into the Plane of Tranquility.  There was a moment of panic until we saw Semidil unconscious next to us.  Mentally exhausted but safe, we ended our exploration into Torment the only way we could have, defeated. Other adventurers had been trapped, doomed to an eternity of pain and misery. We did return, however, with a tale to tell and a little smarter for the experience.</p>

<p>Two years ago the Shissar gave me the greatest gift I had ever been given and then ripped it out of my mind like a barbed arrow.  For two days they injected sixty years of a life I had never lived into me.  I fell in love with and married a woman who has never existed.  Sometimes in that place between sleep and consciousness I can still feel her next to me, her hand draped across my chest.  Then I awaken further and remember that she was nothing but a dark electricity burned into my mind and I weep.  Sometimes I hear my son's laugh in the streets of the bazaar and I turn with a smile before my mind reminds me that he was never born.  For two years I have had to struggle with the acceptance that none of it was real.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if I have left the ancient laboratories of the Shissar warlocks at all.  I wonder if I am still living my own life or living the sixty year lie they wrapped around me.  One thing convinces me that the life I live now is real; I never questioned the one the Shissar fed to me.  I enter the Planes for a few reasons, but there is one strong one I do not wish to admit.  I go to the Planes because it is the only place that feels real.  The surrealism of the outer planes wraps around me like the embrace of a mother and for just a moment I remember the feel of Elandra's hand in mine.  That is usually just before the demons come.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 40: Shades of Grey</h2>
  
    <p>For six years I have served the Emerald Guardians. I was proud to wear their leaf on my cloak and eager to serve the people who had felt such torment at the fall of Takish Hiz. It was a joy to travel to the far reaches of Tunaria as an agent of the Guardians. It may now be my greatest pain.</p>

    <p>Scores of orcs have fallen to my arrows. The goblin witch, Tesht'uzu, spit out her last curse when my blade crossed her throat. I traveled to Diren's Hold and defeated the great bear, Trapmaw. But then my duties changed. I was sent west to find a Tier'Dal Enchanter and his prisoner, an elven maiden whose mind had been broken with his poisoned words. I found them at an inn in Highbourne. The Tier'Dal's wicked magics ceased when I cut off his hands and then his head. A stab of my guardian's blade ended the screams of the mind-warped elven maiden. It wasn't until her hand reached out to her dead lover that the truth reached me. Charmed vessels do not cry over fallen masters.</p>

    <p>Troubled, I followed new instructions to head south through the desert of Ro to recover an artifact of the church of Tunare stolen by a fallen priestess. It took me weeks to find her, deep in the swamps of Guk on a ruined pyramid of an old, dark god. She was in prayer to whatever dark god she now served when my first arrow tore into her side. A wolf-shaped demon attacked me from the shadows. The elven enchantments of my blades ripped into its ghostly form and it burst into smoke. Tesarin Moonstrider clutched the chalice to her breast, her prayers never ceasing, even when I plunged my thin scimitar through her chest to the hilt. It was difficult to understand the prayers she whispered as life left her. One thing rang clear. They were prayers to Tunare.</p>

    <p>For six years I have been an agent of the Fayspires. Through bureaucratic double-talk and false patriotism they have turned me into a weapon. I believed I was a ranger of Tunaria, serving the will of the Mother. Tunare has left Tunaria and left behind the salted earth of a once-great elven empire. Ranger is not the right word for what I am. The world is not black and white. I am Tarlin the Grey.</p>

    <p>I am an assassin.</p>

    <p>- From the journals of Tarlin of Tunaria</p>

    <p>Loral pushed the worn leather journal across the table, knocking over his glass and spilling his red wine on the table. The words hit him like a hammer. It shattered a fog that had surrounded him since the days he left for Kunark. Their missions had never been to rescue the elf maiden, Fironia Vie, but to fill the treasure-rich lands of Kunark with those who served their interests. It had all been a lie.</p>

    <p>For decades Loral had followed the church's orders, traveling throughout Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and now the outer planes. Their motives or goals were never clear. Loral had never asked for justification. He was trained to follow the will of the church. Now images of his past flashed into his mind as the words of his father, written five hundred years earlier, rang in his ears. The death of the Overking Bathezid, the death of Venril Sather himself, the vampyre Xalgoz, General V'Ghera, Trakanon, Nagafen, Lady Vox, King Tormax, Innoruuk, Cazic Thule, Terris Thule, Bertoxxulous, Rallos Zek and his sons, all of them had been slain with Loral's assistance. Hundreds had been slain to further the goals of the council of Felwithe, expanding their lands, their influence, and their coffers.</p>

    <p>Loral had been their weapon.</p>

    <p>He left the city of Tanaan at once and traveled to Felwithe with only one thought in his mind. He must face Yeolarn.</p>

    <p>The stone door slid open, splashing the room with harsh light. Loral walked in, silouetted black against the white light of day behind him. His explosive entrance sent the guards' hands to the hilts of their blades. They softened when they recognized Loral, not because they no longer thought he was a threat, but because there was little they could do about it if he was.</p>

    <p>Allia Moondancer smiled when she recognized Loral under the hood of his cloak but the smile dropped when she saw the fury in his blue eyes. As unthinkable as it was, Allia saw the truth of this visit. If this conversation did not go well, elven blood would spill in the church of Tunare.</p>

    <p>"How long have I been an assassin of the church, Yeolarn?" Loral roared. "How long have you built me into the dagger of Felwithe? How long did it take you to decide to feed me to the Shissar? How surprised were you when I returned?"</p>

    <p>Loral stopped dangerously close to the platform where Yeolarn stood. The Tunarian priests had the words of their battlemagic on their lips, but few had great expectations for their success. They foresaw their magics flowing off of Loral's enchanted armor like water. They saw his ethereal hammer swing out impossibly fast, crushing the steel helmets of the guards along with the skulls inside. They saw his magic, a chaotic magic fueled by a demon some had whispered, rip through them like thousands of blades. All of the priests stood tense and ready. All but Yeolarn, who leaned heavily on his staff as if Loral's questions added weight to his shoulders.</p>

    <p>"We sent you to Ssraeshza because we could not send an army. We sent you because you ARE an army. How long have we battled Crushbone? How long have we kept the orcs in check when you alone could kill every orc in Crushbone in two hours? We do not send you to Crushbone because the orcs are necessary for the stability of Felwithe. You are an agent of the church. We send you to the far reaches of the land. We send you into the pits of hell and we send you alone."</p>

    <p>The scarred shield burned on Loral's arm. Deep in his mind he heard the whispers of Xuzl. THEY HAVE BETRAYED YOU, ELF, AS THEY DID YOUR FATHER. RAISE YOUR HAND AND SHOW THEM WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. GIVE THEM THE JUSTICE THEY DESERVE..</p>

    <p>"Felwithe is no single entity, it has no single mind," Yeolarn continued. "The motivations of each council member is as different as we are from the Tier'Dal. Some sent you to Luclin to see if Felwithe was in danger. Others sent you to die. We have many agents in the lands, each acting independently. Some are killed. Some break under the strain and turn against the Mother herself. But you return. You always have."</p>

    <p>Loral felt his skin set fire from within. RELEASE ME. RELEASE ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU VENGEANCE. YOU CAN WALK AWAY WHILE THE CORRUPTION OF FELWITHE BURNS BEHIND YOU. DESTROY THIS CITY THAT SO INSULTS THE NATURE OF TUNARE. Loral clenched his fists Yeolarn continued.</p>

    <p>"Fironia Vie's name was a banner for our interests in Kunark. Venril Sather needed to die, whether a threat to Felwithe or not. Emperor Ssraeshza needed to die, whether he would have left his temple or not. We send you because there is evil that must be destroyed. It is not about the safety of Felwithe, it is about good and evil. It is about the will of Tunare."</p>

    <p>Loral's head swam. Behind his eyes Xuzl screamed for release. Visions filled Lorals mind of Xuzl exploding from the church and burning all of Felwithe in a great ball of fire.</p>

    <p>"You knew the truth before you walked in that door. You act in the interests of Tunare, in the interests of good. You have done so before and you will do so again."</p>

    <p>Yeolarn handed Loral a scroll sealed in wax.</p>

    <p>"Takish Hiz has been found."</p>

    <p>Silence filled Loral's mind as both he and the demon within his cursed shield considered this news. Then the voice of Xuzl screamed again in a tongue thousands of years older than the elves. Loral silenced him with a single thought, a single promise.</p>

    <p>He would release Xuzl in Felwithe.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 41: Banishment</h2>
  
    <p>It had been seven years since Loral had retired from his days of adventure, but he had one last job to do.  Loral walked slowly around the cavern, carefully inspecting every detail of the large room. Any flaw in its construction could spell disaster for those within, and eventually all of Norrath. Two large ballistae, huge crossbows with bolts two meters long, were bolted to the floor corners of the room. Seeing these siege weapons in such a small room would make no sense to any outside observer, but to Loral, they were critically important. Loral checked the chains that ran across the floor ending at two huge stone wheels on the far end.  Loral looked to the two armored barbarians that stood to the sides of the large wheels, iron hammers slung over their shoulders.  He turned and looked to the two elves that manned the giant crossbows.  The resolve of these warriors would be more critical than the flawless engineering of the room and its furnishings. They were about to see something few mortals ever did, and fewer still ever lived to talk about it.</p>

    <p>Loral took out a black gem from a pouch on his belt. A single word activated the priceless gem, and once activated it could never be deactivated.  The huge crossbows, the unbreakable chains, and the strength of the warriors would all fail if the gem was not activated properly. Each was a piece of a large puzzle, each had to be put in at just the right time or they would all die.  Loral took a deep breath.  It was time to release Xuzl. Loral took the battered shield off of his back and set it in the center of the floor.</p>

    <p>"Awaken Xuzl. You are free."</p>

    <p>A vibration filled the room, rattling the chains on the floor and drawing concerned looks from the guards. The edge of the shield began to glow and then burst into flame. The circle expanded outward forming a large pool of fire. A sudden blast of hot air filled the room as the portal to the Plane of Fire opened.</p>

    <p>A red claw reached out of the pool and gripped the stone floor. Another claw followed the first and the two heaved up the rest of the demon's bulk from the pit. Xuzl's green eyes beheld the small priest.  The foolish priest had kept his word.  Xuzl was free.</p>

    <p>Upon blackened hooves, Xuzl stood above the fiery pit.  He stretched his full fifteen feet height expanding his wings to the edges of the room.  He beheld the priest again with his burning green eyes, he hissing laughter filling Loral's mind.</p>

    <p>"Ganthalrom"</p>

    <p>The word of command activated the black gem. The shine from Loral's earrings and rings faded.  Two magical gems that lit the room darkened immediately but the four torches of the room stayed lit.  The demon felt the shell of invisible protection surrounding his huge frame disappear. He called upon a column of lava to incinerate the priest but no fire came. All of his magical powers were gone along with all other magic in the room.  All magic within one hundred feet of the black gem ceased to exist.</p>

    <p>It mattered little to Xuzl. Even without his powerful magic, the demon was stronger than a the Ice Giants of Permafrost. He could crush all five of these pitiful creatures with a single stone. That was when he noticed the ballistae.</p>

    <p>"Fire"</p>

    <p>Two huge bolts, each a six foot steel rod tipped with a black barbed tip, tore through Xuzl's arms. The huge chains, attached to the end of the bolts, raced up the ground and criss crossed Xuzl's massive chest. Xuzl roared and the guardians felt their knees grow week. One of the elves manning the ballistae fell to the ground, his hands covering his head.</p>

    <p>The two barbarians bashed out two logs that held the stone wheels in place with their hammers. Behind the wall, a four ton stone weight fell. A network of levers and pulleys behind the wall pulled the chains tight around the beast. Four huge chains wrapped the demon around the chest, crushing the bones of the beast's wings.  Three more wrapped around its legs.  Xuzl was pinned to the wall, the chains held tight by the huge stone weight.  The strength of twenty frost giants could not break their bond.</p>

    <p>Loral had spent years studying the powers of extraplanar creatures and in almost all cases they had three powerful weapons; physical strength, magical abilities, and psionics . Two of the demon's three weapons had been removed.  Only one remained.</p>

    <p>While magical energies were drawn from the outer planes or their gods, even from one plane to another, the psychic abilities of outer planar demons came from a different source.  Unlike magical energy which would be stopped by the black gem, psychic energy worked on the internal powers of the mind and would be unaffected. Sometimes these psychic effects were subtle. Xuzl's was not.</p>

    <p>The elf that manned the left ballistae screamed, a scream so violent that his throat ripped itself apart from the strain. Blood flowed from his eyes and ears, running rivers down his cheeks. Loral felt his stomach heave when he heard a small pop and the elf fell dead to the stone floor, his brain crushed under the might of Xuzl's powers.</p>

    <p>The barbarian to the beast's left took out a large black shining helm he had hanging on his back. The helm cost almost as much as the black gem, its shape forged from instructions over five thousand years old. It was built from a material known to block the mental intrusions of the Shissar and was used as armor by the ogres of Old Norrath. The ogres used the armor to keep psychic intrusion out, but this helm was designed to keep it in. Most importantly, the power of the helm to block psychic abilities was not magical but natural.  It would work within the stones antimagic shell.</p>

<p>The ogre put the helm over Xuzl's huge head, the form fitting perfectly around the demon's black horns and covered the green burning eyes of the demon with smooth black metal. A latch clamped the helm shut, tight against the creature's head.  Loral let out a sigh of relief.  Had the helm not fit, they would have all died as their elven companion had.</p>

    <p>Xuzl felt his senses crash down. He could no longer hear the thoughts and emotions of the attackers. He could not send out his psychic tendrils into their minds. He could not summon his powers to call forth waves of lava or reopen a gateway back to his home world.  He could not even see.  For the first time in fifty thousand years of life, the arch-demon Xuzl was afraid.</p>

    <p>Loral watched the chest muscles of the huge beast flex against the strain of the giant chains. He saw the black claw clench into a fist and extend as if reach for something, anything. The chains pinned the creature completely to the wall, his arms wrapped around him in some obscene embrace.  Xuzl's roar got softer and softer, turning into an inhuman whimper as the chains tightened around his chest. Loral could not see Xuzl's eyes under the black helm, but the whimper was one that brought no hatred into Loral's mind.</p>

    <p>For the first time since contemplating the trapping of this unholy beast, Loral had doubt. He would have thought this feeling was one of Xuzl's psychic tricks, but with the black helm in place he knew such a trick was impossible. Who was he to trap so mighty a creature? He had orchestrated and carried out a plan to trap this beast forever within this tomb. What right did he have to do so?</p>

    <p>Another vision filled Loral's head. One of the beast Xuzl plucking an armored female elf off of a hill far away in the lands of Tunaria. The beast flew high, crushing the screaming paladin in an immortally strong grip. With a smile and a chuckle, the demon bit off her screaming head and swallowed it whole.</p>

    <p>Loral's vision snapped back to the trapped beast, faceless under the black helm. To remove such a creature from the world of Norrath was necessary. To have such a power free in the mortal world or even the planes was against all that was good.</p>

    <p>Loral and his remaining companions left the chamber, sealing the door behind them. After a few hours, the torches burned themselves out and the room was black.  The only sound was the forced breathing of the demon, his chest too constrict to scream or even speak.</p>

    <p>Loral walked past the illusionary treasure room filled with a king's ransom in platinum and magical items. Two stone guardians, built and enchanted by gnomish arch-mages stood motionless, protecting the room from intrusion forever. Should any adventurers get this far, an almost impossible feat, they would think the treasure room to be the final victory.  None would suspect the giant rock on the opposite wall to contain the unholy beast Xuzl, and his eternal tomb.</p>

<p>Thoughts of the demon flowed out of Loral as the thick liquid of the potion of forgetfulness flowed down his throat. In moments, he and his three remaining companions would forget the entire experience. It was the only way to ensure their secret remained so. All three stepped out of the maze-like catacombs and into the inner chambers of the Church of Tunare. Soon all three were walking through the streets of Felwithe, the encounter and its location already forgotten.</p>

    <p>None of them remembered that a few hundred feet below the streets of the elven city of Felwithe, chained to the wall and bathed in pitch blackness, hissed the eternal breath of Xuzl the demon. The demon, however, would never forget.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 42: Aviatis</h2>
  
    <p>Loral sat in a dwarven tavern outside of the city of Kaladim. He drank the thick liquid of dwarven ale, the sweetest and weakest the bartender had available but still far too thick for Loral's taste. He spent very little time in this area nowadays, but rumors of the Wayfarers had him looking for information. This band of treasure-seekers seemed to appear out of nowhere, quickly building camps across Norrath. Rumors spoke of the treasures they promised to any who explored newly discovered dens of evil. Having heard of the location of the Wayfarer camp from a drunken dwarf just before passing out, Loral closed his leather-bound journal, returned it to a pouch at his side, and left for the camp.</p>

    <p>On reaching the Wayfarer's camp, he was immediately shocked by the sheer volume and excitement of the people around it. Hundreds of adventurers milled about.   Some were young and inexperienced and others were obviously seasoned and powerful. The Wayfarers themselves were as diverse as those who sought them out. Dark elves and wood elves chatted together while barbiarians and trolls toasted each other with giant flagons of mead.  It pleased Loral to see such diversity.  This breaking of racial barriers hadn't been seen on Norrath since the fall of the Combine empire.</p>

    <p>Joining the Wayfarers was not difficult and Loral was quickly given a task to perform. Loral traveled to an exhumed graveyard in the cursed forest of Lesser Faydark where a network of caverns had been found under a lost cemetery. One of the graves had broken into a pit leading into the caverns below.  Many adventurers gathered around the excavation and the remains of dozens of bodies were scattered about. The whole hill smelled of death.  Loral looked with trepidation into the pit.</p>

    <p>A strong clap on Loral's back gave him a jolt and the stout dwarf Stonehewer laughed at the expression of shock on Loral's face. Juror the shaman smiled behind the dwarf with two of his bladeswingers, Llyan and Vamcill by his side. Kaylessa, one of Felwithe's adventuring enchanters and friend to the guild of Healers, approached as well. Their party was ready. With one last prayer to Tunare, Loral and his companions dropped into the pit.</p>

    <p>Thick liquids of tainted life and mists of tormented souls seeped into the broken earth, filling the rats, bats, and spiders inside with a lust for blood and fearsome strength. Jointed legs covered in coarse hair dragged the bulk of huge spiders through the caverns. The white sightless eyes of giant rats turned towards the party and lines of diseased drool spattered to the ground. As soon as the mutated beasts sensed the adventuring party, they attacked.</p>

    <p>The party fought the masses of tainted beasts for hours. Powerful magics broke open the shells of the huge spiders. Thick lumps of black gore fell onto the ground. Llyan pierced the boated bodies of the giant rats, pinning them squealing to the earth. The chanting of the party's spellcasters was almost continuous as wave after wave of the creatures vomited forth from the infected caverns. As grotesque as these creatures were, the party soon faced a far more dangerous foe.</p>

    <p>Standing calmly, the slight female figure could easily have been mistaken for an elf except for the sickly pale skin. She stood and beheld them calmly, her eyes gleaming silver in the torch light. Her grey lips twisted into a smile, revealing long fangs. She attacked with unnatural speed and went right for Loral's throat. Were it not for Stonehewer's quick movements she would have torn it open.</p>

    <p>Stonehewer cleaved his firey blade towards her back. She twisted quickly avoiding the blade and swiped a claw at the dwarven knight, tearing four deep gashes into his face. Loral sealed the deep wounds with a prayer to Tunare. Juror cupped his hands and a roar of tiny insects engulfed the vampiress. Vamcill's red-runed scimitar cut down hard, splitting her open from her shoulder down to her hip.</p>

    <p>Two caverns away, Aviatis opened his own silver eyes, his telepathic bond to the Scion broken. He turned and fixed his eyes on his two black-robed advisors. They nodded silently and stepped out into the cavern entrance.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>As much as the Scion Caretaker's attack had shaken the party, the two Trueborn's were far more sinister. They were a head taller than the party's biggest member and covered in thick black robes deeply embroidered in red and gold. Their gaunt faces peered out from under the deep hoods with sunken cheeks and dead eyes. One raised his palms towards the party and waves of flames roared onto the party. The other drew a wicked blade engraved with skulls and coated with his own black blood.  Stonehewer cut at blade wielder but the Trueborn sidestepped faster than the dwarf could see.</p>

    <p>Stonehewer grunted, pulled his blade back, and stabbed deep into the vampire's stomach. The vampire smiled, gripped Stonehewer's wrist, and with inhuman strength forced the blade out of his body. Blue waves flowed from the second Trueborn's hands and the mortal wound sealed.</p>

    <p>Stonehewer grunted again at this bad turn of luck. With one Trueborn healing the other, they would outlast the party's attacks. Stonehewer fixed the solution in typical dwarven style by smashing the spellcasting vampire in the mouth with his armored fist. The Trueborn reeled, his jaw broken. Black blood and jagged teeth spattered to the ground. Stonehewer looked down to his stained fist and grunted a third time.</p>

    <p>"I'll never get this stuff off," he said shaking the dark blood from his fist. With a half turn and powerful swing, Stonehewer swung his two handed sword again. The pale head of the first Trueborn fell into the dirt.</p>

    <p>Loral locked eyes with the second Trueborn who held his broken jaw with fingers covered in dark blood. Loral raised his hand and chanted to Tunare. A beam of white light bored into the vampire's chest and ripped out the tormented spirit. The dead corpse fell to the ground in a smoking heap.</p>

    <p>While they had vanquished the minions of Aviatis, the lord himself was beyond their estimations. Aviatis had climbed the ranks of the Trueborns for centuries and he did not do it by being either stupid or weak. They saw him standing alone in the center of his inner sanctum. He was even taller than the Trueborns they had faced before. Vamcill strode forward without a word, but they were not prepared for the reaction.</p>

    
      
    

    <p>Loral felt his blood become thick. His heart slowed and he became instantly weak. His head throbbed in pain that blurred his vision on every pulse. He was faintly aware that the others were clutching at their chests and falling to their knees. Juror's spear clattered to the ground. Within merely the presence of the vampire lord, they had already lost.</p>

    <p>Loral heard the voice within his mind. The demon Xuzl spoke to him, told him to use the power within the shield on his arm. The horrible effect of the vampire's spell lifted and Loral found himself able to concentrate. He rose in front of the surprised vampire lord and with a quick swing, smashed the lord in the knee with his spiritual hammer, Daninulaer. A burst of white fire exploded over the vampire lord.</p>

    <p>Aviatis howled with rage and pain. His spell had broken. The others returned to their feet, quickly preparing their most powerful magics or most devastating attacks. Llyan fired arrow after arrow into the vampire. Many skipped harmlessly over the vampire lord's protective spells but some burrowed deep into the vampire's dead skin. A black tendril rolled off of Juror's palm and burrowed deep into the vampire's skin. The skin cracked and oozed black blood. Stonehewer strode in.</p>

    <p>The vampire's head snapped up and he punched out. A huge spiritual fist followed the move and blasted Stonehewer back against the rocky wall, crushing the wind out of him and knocking him unconscious. Aviatis whirled again and shards of ice ripped through the party. Clinching his jaw against the pain, Juror strode forward and rammed his spear deep into the lord's chest, piercing its black heart. The vampire and Juror locked eyes with each other. Juror ripped out the spear and the vampire fell dead to the ground.</p>

    <p>They had taken what trinkets they had found along the way back to the Wayfarers. Among the treasures of the vampire lord was a worn leather book. It had deep engravings in the thick cover, a cover of some skin Loral preferred not to think about, and on its back was a strange symbol or glyph. The language was old and it would take him much time to translate. He did not yet know that its message held the fate of Norrath within it.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 43: The Wayfarers</h2>
  
<p>The two elves glanced nervously about the crowded inn.  They did not much enjoy leaving their fair wood of the Faydark but their most recent employment demanded it.  Leaving the wood was bad enough but traveling through the Spires to the moon of Luclin was even more disturbing.</p>

<p>Talamiin, the older of the two and a seasoned warrior, spoke little as he sat hunched over his untouched ale.  He glanced at the adventurers entering the tavern, hoping to finish this job and be done with it.</p>

<p>"Have you met him before?" Silvian, the younger and far more eager elf, asked.  Talamiin shook his head.  "The guards of Felwithe speak of him."  Silvian continued, not noticing his companion's disinterest.  "He is a high priest with both Exarch and Archon titles of the church," Silvian continued. "He has been in the wilds since the discovery of Kunark.  He only returns to resupply himself and report to the church.  He is usually back out within twelve hours.  The loose lipped acolytes say that every promotion or title has been an attempt to bring him back.  Most priests his age have either returned to Felwithe or left the church.  But he won't come back and he won't leave."</p>

<p>"There are darker rumors as well."  Silvian lowered his voice. "Some say he consorts with demons and other dark powers.  He has traveled with ogres, trolls, even Tier'dal, at one time or another.  But he is still an agent of the Church, probably one of their best it is said."</p>

<p>"He is a murderer and a monster," the older elf spoke suddenly.  "Three years ago he killed a fellow cleric who interrupted one of his dark rituals.  The church says he was under a curse, but I think they still needed him rather than have him beheaded as he should have been.  It doesn't matter.  Here he is."</p>

<p>Silvian looked to the door and saw the cloaked figure enter.  He was tall and stood straight.  From under his hood he beheld the room through a pair of multi-colored spectacles.  Behind the curious spectacles, Silvian saw his cold blue eyes, eyes that seemed to stare beyond the walls of the room.  Silvian saw Loral's golden armor under his cloak, tarnished with weeks of travel.  Loral's eyes locked onto the two elves as he approached their table.  Silvian nodded to the priest and raised two fingers to his chest in a sign of blessing to the Mother of All, Tunare.  Loral casually returned the gesture.  Talamiin did nothing.</p>

<p>"I hear you have information for me."  Loral's voice sent shivers through Silvian.  He became aware that he was looking at the same high elf that had faced the rulers of Kunark, had battled against the devils of the outer planes,   had defeated the avatars of no less than twelve gods, four of them elder gods, and had faced and returned from the trials of the dragons of the Claws.</p>

<p>Talamiin kicked Silvian's chair and Silvian jumped.  Talamiin nodded to him to give their information.  Silvian was aware of Talamiin's dislike of the priest and he was aware that Loral was aware.  It seemed not to concern Loral, and Silvian began his tale.</p>

<p>"The Wayfarers have agents in every known city of Norrath.  They do not attempt to hide their presence but their popularity gives them access to a vast amount of information.  They have wizards and telepaths to share information among their agents and their camps."  Silvian paused for a moment.  "In three months the Wayfarers have become the most well informed, well connected, well financed, and with their mercenary force of adventurers, the most powerful organization of Norrath."</p>

<p>Loral looked down to the table for a moment, considering the words.  Then he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Where do they come from?"</p>

<p>"Their leader is a barbarian rogue named Mordin Rasp.  He and some adventurer friends of his formed the core of the Wayfarers.  They seem to have a limitless supply of magical artifacts which they reward to adventurers who work for them.  Their job seems honorable enough."  Silvian paused again, carefully considering his next words.  "Felwithe has supported their cause."</p>

<p>Loral's eyes shot up, locking hard onto Silvian's.  Silvian stiffened, not expecting such a quick and powerful reaction to his subtle implication.  He was not accusing Loral of subversion, but why would the priest hire them to look into a situation Felwithe had already dismissed.</p>

<p>"A group shows up out of nowhere.  In two months its agents infiltrate every city.  Their camps become small towns visited by the most powerful hunters of our world.  They are rich, powerful, and better connected than any other organization.  As soon as they appear, dens of some of the worst evil we have ever seen suddenly appear.  We do not know where they come from, we do not know what they want, and no one questions their appearance.  Felwithe may not be worried, but I am."</p>

<p>Loral reached under his cloak and dropped a bag onto the table.  Silvian sat with his mouth agape as Loral stood and left.  He looked to his companion and saw a smile on Talamiin's face.</p>

<p>"I may have been wrong about him after all."</p>

  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 44: Deepest Guk</h2>
  
<p>Loral's head swam with the clues and rumors he had heard as he and his traveling companions walked through the upper caverns of the Froglok city of Guk.  He had heard of a curse of ancient evil and of the Grozmok stone but his pondering became circular as they walked.  Llyan the ranger was in front with Stonehewer the dwarven paladin, Juror the barbarian shaman, Loral the elven cleric, Kaylessa the elven enchantress, and Criket the Vah Shir beastlord in the rear.  Criket's warder, a five hundred pound striped cat, followed behind to make sure no beasts would take them by surprise.</p>

    
      
    

<p>Loral's thoughts of these rumors ceased when he came to the boarded passage that led to the deepest caverns of Guk.  It had been blocked by the Frogloks themselves after their scouting parties came screaming back out or did not come back at all. Stonehewer turned to the rest of the party, smiled, and kicked in the boarded up cavern entrance.  It was a typical dwarven conclusion to the topic of whether or not they should continue.</p>

<p>A foul air rose from the passage.  Strong winds howled through the tunnels.  The scraping and cracking of the deeper tunnels unnerved the party.  Finding strength within each other, the party continued into the complex network of caverns.</p>

<p>Stonehewer's cry of surprise and the twang of Llyan's bow were Loral's first warning of danger.  He saw the sagging grey-skinned creature crawling towards them with long fingered hands and webbed feet.  Its long infected tongue lolled out, dragging on the ground behind it.  Llyan's arrow had burst one of the milky dead eyes of the beast.  Yellow liquid dripped down its grey rotted cheek like a broken egg yoke.  The smell gagged Loral, making him stop in the middle of a prayer and ruining the spell he began to cast.  Loral saw bones tearing through the dead flesh of the beast.  There was no doubt that they faced the crawling hungry dead of Deepest Guk.</p>
    
      
    
<p>Another of Llyan's arrows ripped into the beasts throat before Criket's warder roared in, tearing the beast apart with four inch claws.  The shock of the beast wore off Stonehewer. The paladin took three menacing steps forward and with a powerful overhand cut, severed the beast in two.</p>

<p>For twelve hours the party battled the undead minions of Guk, some rotting husks of recent adventurers, some ancient skeletal remains of Guk's ancestors.  Occationally a ghastly figure would form through the walls, spirits of the tormented dead of Guk, and rake at the party with ethereal claws.  Crossing into a large cavern of vine covered stone and green pools of bacteria, the party felt something else.</p>
    
      
    
<p>A hissing vibration filled the room.  The party felt it in their teeth and lower parts of their mind, the parts that will pull a hand out of a fire without thinking.  The hiss got louder and one of the strangest beast they had seen rounded one of the caverns corners.  It floated in the air about four feet off the ground.  It had a spherical bony shell surrounding a huge eye that stared angrily at them.  Tentacles, some ending in hideous mouths with needle-like teeth, others ending with sharp jagged blades, wiggled angrily at the party.  The hiss lowered its pitch and began to shake the party's nerves, paralyzing them.</p>

<p>The creature floated calmly over to the elven maiden, Kaylessa, preparing three of the vile mouths to tear into her soft skin.  With his remaining stamina, Llyan broke from the paralyzing grip of the eye's mental attack, drew his thin blade, and stabbed it in the most likely of targets, dead center in the huge eye.  The Oculus burst, spraying the party with fluid.  An inhuman primal scream filled their mind, reaching pitches beyond the capabilities of the mind to comprehend.  They fell to the ground in agony but as the thrashes of the eye began to slow, the pain went away.  Soon, it was dead and the party stood staring at horrifying creature with Llyan's blade protruding from its black pupal.</p>

<p>Oblivious to the battles above him the lich-priest, Bhotea, sat huddled over a web shrouded tome.  For the better part of a year he had researched this dark work.  Its words and runes twisted and reformed the more he read.  His body had begun to decay since reading the dark book, feeding its evil, but the priest no longer cared.  His longtime traveling companion, once a Guktan Paladin of Mithanial Marr, lay on a stone alter dissected and disemboweled.  He was a small sacrifice in the pursuit of power, thought Bhotea.</p>
    
      
    
<p>A blazing flash of light in the corridor ahead of him tore the lich's attention from his beloved book.  He did not expect to see what he saw.  A dwarf, armored in shining blue plate armor, was stained with the black blood of the undead minions that shared this cavern with the lich.  His skin was ashen from the ethereal wounds of dozens of ghastly spectres but his eyes burned with a blazing life the lich no longer knew.</p>

<p>Stonehewer charged in holding his twin-bladed sword high.  The undead priest raised his hand and a blast of magical energy sent Stonehewer crashing to the ground.  Two arrows from Llyan's bow streaked in but a wave of the lich's hand turned them into dust before they reached him.  Juror blew a small wisp of dust from his hand.  The cloud grew into millions of tiny insects that roared around the lich.  The lich chanted three words and black tentacles burst from the floor around the barbarian, tearing into his legs and dragging him to the ground.  Criket and her warder both rushed in but were repelled by the same barrier that stopped Llyan's arrows.  The lich-priest grasped out with his clawed hand and made a fist in the air.  Criket came off the ground, crushed within a huge invisible hand.  Loral heard Criket's bones snapping as she floated in the air a few feet from the lich.</p>
    
      
    
<p>Kaylessa chanted her own spell.  A tiny black ball formed in her hand. It flew from the elven enchantress and smashed into the lich's invisible barrier with the sound of shattered glass.  Criket collapsed into a heap on the ground.  Stonehewer, understanding the significance of what happened, rose and approached the small undead wizard.  He cut powerfully and the lich's decomposing head flew into the air followed by a gyser of black sour blood.</p>

<p>Two days later the party sat outside the Wayfarer's Southern Ro camp.  Criket, now fully healed, sent her cat after Llyan who ran merrily in wolf form.  Juror and Kaylessa were speaking with one of the Wayfarers while Stonehewer tried with frustration to polish off the black acidic blood of the lich from his silver blade.  Loral, a small black-skinned journal in his hand, wrote of their adventure and his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I do not know what the Wayfarer's want, but I know that no evil such as the liches of Deepest Guk should remain."  Loral penned carefully.  "While their motivations are unknown the Wayfarer's instruction has aided the forces of good.  Perhaps I was wrong about them."</p>

  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 45: The Fireborn</h2>
  
<p>For three thousand years Fxandrakulzis the Fireborn ruled his lair in the caverns of Garulon within the Plane of Fire.  It was not a large lair, perhaps two thousand minions, but it afforded him the opportunity to delve into his passion, necromancy.  Five hundred years previous the Fireborn acquired a book outlining the dark art.  Following its instructions he tore apart dozens of his demonic minions and mortal slaves only to raise them as twisted undead beasts.  But the Fireborn was not satisfied.  He constantly sought out new necromatic magic to add to his dark powers.  Soon his wishes were answered.</p>

    
      
    

<p>At the height of his power, the lich Miragul opened up rifts to both the Plane of Torment and the Plane of Fire.  He knew of the Fireborn and had heard of his vast knowledge of necromancy.  It took a great deal of the lich's power, but soon through a burning summoning circle deep in his icy labratory, Miragul pulled the Fireborn into the world of Norrath.</p>

<p>The Fireborn found that the lich Miragul was the only mortal he had ever liked, even perhaps admired if a greater demon can admire any mortal.  Together they built creations of true villainy and great horror, the Demonbone Skeletons.  These twisted remains of mortal bodies and demonic spirits had a thirst for blood beyond any creature of Norrath and an unnatural strength to match.</p>
    
      
    

<p>One day Miragul left the Fireborn's laboratory and never returned.  It mattered little to the red leathery-winged demon.  He drew fourth minions of his own world, huge muscled beasts like himself and continued his work.  Soon the icy caverns of Miragul's lair were filled with the Fireborn's demon-blooded undead.  Even planar beasts of Torment served his will, some huge rough-furred hulks and others hideous malformations of flesh, muscle, and fanged tentacles.  Soon after, the caverns of Miragul's lair had been uncovered.</p>

<p>It was then that the Fireborn met the priest.</p>

<p>He had just finished the construction of a huge and powerful demonbone skeleton, one built from the bones of a cloven hoofed Tormentor and a mammoth.  It was filled with a dark spirit that made even the Fireborn shivver.  He found the entrance of the adventuring party to be quite timely.</p>
    
      
    
<p>The Fireborn sent a telepathic command to his new beast and both he and a fellow red-winged demon watched the monstrosity rush out into the icy caverns.  A crash of thunder filled the hall.  A blast of heat rushed into the normally chilled halls.  For the Fireborn and his companion it was a taste of the fiery pits of home.  The clash of battle could be heard in the hall for perhaps a minute and then the party entered the Fireborn's lair.</p>

<p>The Fireborn took no chances.  He sent the other demon forward and sent a wave of lava over the party.  Each member of the six used some form of protection from molten rock.  Three hid behind shields, two behind cloaks, and one simply let it roll off of the protective shell of his armor.</p>

<p>The party was very well equipped.  He soon saw that their skills matched their equipment when his minion was cut down under a flurry of blades and spells.</p>
    
      
    
<p>The Fireborn had not lived for four thousand years by acting rashly.  He knew when he was out-matched.  He was already chanting his darkspeech, preparing to return to his own world when the first arrow pierced his side.  His spell fizzled when a stunning blast from the outstretched hand of a dwarven bladeswinger knocked him back.  The sword wielders of the party where on him in an instant, tearing into his thick red skin and through his leathery wings.  He ripped at them with claws lined with fire, inflicting hideous gaping wounds but blue waves of light sealed them and the party continued their attack.</p>

<p>Then a voice filled his head, a telepathic voice in the darkspeech of the demon princes.  It was a voice he knew well.</p>

<p>"Hello, dear friend," Xuzl spoke.</p>

<p>"Master! Protect me from these hideous mortals!" the Fireborn pleaded in his own telepathic reply.</p>

<p>"You cannot win, especially not against one holding me," the voice spoke calmly.</p>

<p>The Fireborn saw it.  A circular shield blazing with fire held by the golden-armored priest.  A thousand questions entered his mind but all of them were silenced when a beam of searing red energy burned a perfect hole through the center of his head like a third eye.  The last thing he saw was the shield blazing with fire, the fire of his master.  He awoke on his island of rock in the center of a thousand mile lake of lava in the Plane of Fire.  It would be five hundred years before he could return to Norrath again.  Streams of lava rolled down his red cheeks.  He had been betrayed.</p>

  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 46: The Vampire</h2>
  


<p>The night was black and the moon of Luclin did not rise.  The guards of Felwithe could not say why they held their blades a little tighter and kept their eyes a little shaper.  Something was out there, they could almost smell it.  As sharp as they were that night, however, neither questioned the high elf noble who approached.</p>

<p>He was tall and dressed in fine black robes trimmed with gold runes.  From the wizards guild, no doubt, the guards thought.  He wore no hood over his bald head and stood tall when he approached the guards.  His eyes gripped them at once.  Yes, a noble advisor of the council no doubt, the guards both thought.</p>

<p>Councilman Alines figured it was three in the morning when he heard the knock on his door.  He opened it and stared at the tall black-cloaked figure that stood at his home.</p>

<p>"I must speak with you, councilman," said the pale high elf in a soothing yet commanding voice.  "Please let me in."</p>

<p>Alines stood for a moment, lost in the stranger's eyes and then spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes.  Please come in."  The figure took two steps in and closed the door behind him.  "What do you have to tell me.."</p>

<p>A thin and wickedly sharp dagger flashed past the councilman's eyes.  He had just a moment to notice the fine engraving and deep set gems of the bat-hilted dagger before a shower of blood sprayed from his neck.  Before he could bring a hand to his throat the mouth of the vampire was on him. Impossibly strong arms pinned his own to his sides.  He felt needle-sharp teeth sink in and blackness overtook him.</p>

<p>Little was on the agenda for the morning's council meetings.  Another petition from the Church of Tunare had been filed against Tovarich's venom, the city's only tavern.  This petition had been filed every month for thirty years.  While the priests on the council would vote in favor of the complaint and recommend a new ordinance against the tavern, the paladins and merchants would vote it down.  Business as usual within Elven bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Then councilman Alines dropped his news like a ball of flaming pitch.  His speech was short, lacked all proper council etiquette and was totally convincing. Vampires, werewolves, shadows, and the risen dead were building up like a plague under the Faydark.  They grew stronger every night and would soon threaten Felwithe itself.  The other councilmen noticed how pale Alines looked when he had entered and now they knew why.  Vampires in Faydark!  Alines held a dozen parchments, descriptions of the undead hoards under the unholy grounds.  Something had to be done!  But what?</p>

<p>"War" Alines spoke.  He locked his eyes on each member of the council and the king himself.  "We must send in our armies at once and root out this evil before it poisons the land and destroys our city."  Murmurs filled the hall and after a heavy gavel knocked six times, a vote was called.  It was unanimous.  An army of paladins, clerics, and wizards would enter the catacombs of Mistmoore.  But to the gaseous form of the vampire it was not an army at all.  It was food.</p>

<p>Loral screamed and shot up from his bed.  The vision of a vampire standing on the towers of Felwithe, eyes scanning a conquered city and elven blood dripping from the vampire's mouth, filled his mind.  On a chair opposite him, the circular shield blazed happily.  Xuzl was laughing.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 47: Groumont the Rujarkian</h2>
  
    <p>Brog's hands shook when he entered the cavern Groumont used as his command post. No one ever knew how the orc general would act when given bad news.</p>

    <p>"How goes weapons production," the huge general asked at once.</p>

    <p>"Not well. Only half of our warriors are armed. It will be two months before we have met our goal." Brog prepared for the worst. He witnessed the instant beheading of his predecessor over a similar problem. He would run, he decided, and damn the boars that would surely gore his legs and rip into his back. "Did you shift the miners to metal smith work?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, M'lord."</p>

    <p>"And the armorers?"</p>

    <p>"Also refocused. We forge only weapons now." Brog's eyes went to the great axe that sat at the arm of Gromount's throne. It was almost as tall as the goblin slaves who worked over a table of food to the west of the cavern. A huge bone handle carved with wicked looking runes protruded from a wide axe head notched and scratched from contact with a thousand enemies.</p>

<p>The axe had been given the name "Kneesplitter" when his troops had seen Gromount charge a hill giant on his favorite boar mount and cut off the giant's leg at the knee in one swing.  On his return charge, the orc general cut off the top of the giant's massive head just above the bridge of the nose.</p>

<p>Gromount's fingers gently stroked the tip of the bone handle.</p>

    <p>"Well done, Brog. Increase their rations and tell them the great leader smiles upon them."</p>

    <p>"Sir. We are limited on rations already."</p>

    <p>"Take the rations from the slaves that dig into the mountain. Have a team slaughter them and have the cooks add them to our food stores. We no longer need their services."</p>

    <p>Brog was disgusted with the thought of eating goblin meat but the logic from the old general was flawless. He turned and after one last look at the axe he left.</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>For weeks Wayfarer spies had returned with new findings of the orc activities in the western mountains of Ro. Hundreds of orc-filled caves had been discovered. These were not the same tribes that called the baking desert their home, these were larger, smarter, and far better organized. For every new cave they discovered there were two more they hadn't found. There was no known number of the orc army but it was indeed an army. Freeport was in danger. The caves were only a few miles from the city.</p>
       
    <p>Loral's mind showed him a vision of a plague of orcs, thousands of them, flooding out of the caves of the Commonlands and tearing through the corrupt and disjointed city of Freeport in a matter of hours. Freeport wasn't known for its stability but it was the largest trading port of all of Norrath. Defeat to the Rujarkian orcs would mean instability for everyone else. And there was no negotiation.</p>

    <p>Loral had been researching the travel of the Grozmok stone and his clues had brought him here. He didn't know if the Rujarkian orcs had possessed the stone or still did but he had seen what the stone had done to the Troll shaman and knew its power would feed an evil such as the thick-skinned orcs. These orcs were far more powerful than any he had seen and the twisting magic of the stone was a simple explanation. When it was offered to him, Loral accepted the job of clearing out one of the smaller orc tunnels and returning with any clues of invasion he might find.</p>

    <p>The cave was almost invisible from the outside. Stonehewer, who had little need or desire for subtlety or stealth stepped into a gathering of three large orcs circled around a fire and a particularly foul smelling stew. He impaled one of them on the sharp points of his double-bladed sword. The other two reacted at once. One of these orcs, armored under thick plates of iron, drew a huge jagged sword and the other, cowled in runed leather, fell back and began chanting in a dark guttural language.</p>
       
    <p>Following the dwarf's lead, the rest of the party rushed into the melee. The fair-skinned enchantress, Kaylessa, chanted her own magic and covered the runed orc priest in dazzling lights. The orc's hands stopped and its dark magic fizzled. The other orc attacked with the strength and fury of an enraged bear. He launched a huge two handed cut. Stonehewer, agile even for a dwarf, sidestepped. The blade cut deep into the stone floor. Two arrows from Llyan's bow stabbed deep into the orcs shoulder. Stonehewer opened up the orcs throat with a horizontal cut and black blood sprayed across the cavern walls.</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>Reports came to Gromount every minute with the progress the troublesome adventuring group had made. Twenty of his soldiers, six of his prized war-boars and a dozen goblin warrior slaves had been cut down. Gromount's orders were clear. He must destroy the intruders himself.</p>
       
    <p>Gromount reached for Kneesplitter, the runed bone handle fitting his hands like a natural extension, and with a roar to Zek (whichever Zek god was listening, the general wasn't picky in his prayers) Gromount stormed down the sandstone halls.</p>

    <p>***</p>


    <p>Stonehewer was calmly wiping the blood of his latest victim from his shining blade when the roaring Rujarkian general burst into the room. The dwarf just had time to raise his shield before the massive axe would have split him in two. Even defended, the blow sent Stonehewer skidding across the stone floor and smashing into two crates of questionable rations. Llyan's eagle eye aimed and he fired two arrows at the rampaging orc. With amazing dexterity the orc general dodged one arrow and cut the other in half mid-flight with the great axe.</p>

    <p>Vamcill, the fellow dwarven paladin of Brell, rushed forward and smashed his sturdy shield into the orcs chest. The orc didn't move but responded by punching the dwarf's shield and sending the second dwarf skidding into the boxes of rations. Both dwarves were up and rushing back into battle as Juror the barbarian shaman finished casting his own spell. A cloud of stinging insects flooded over the orc general but the general, wise to such tactics, closed his eyes and mouth and waited for the cloud to pass before breathing again. Juror cursed.</p>
       
    <p>The delay was enough to turn the battle. Llyan fired three more arrows and all three hitting their mark. The orc wheeled around in fury and faced the lithe ranger. With his flank open, Vamcill swung low and cut deep into the rear of the general's knee with his black bladed scimitar. The blade flashed red as it cut through the skin, muscle, and tendons of the orc's leg. The general, howling in pain and continued rage, fell to one knee. With a cut he was getting more and more used to, Stonehewer sent the general's scowling head high into the air on a geyser of black tainted blood.</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>Two days later Loral had returned to Felwithe to research the dusty tomes and flaking scrolls he had collected. Each scribbling of the puzzle floated, formed, and broke apart in his mind. Exhausted, Loral put out the large yellow candle that had dripped over his wooden desk and onto the floor below. Still clothed, he fell onto his bed and was instantly asleep. Loral did not find the answer to his puzzle in his conscious mind. He found it in his dreams.</p>

    <p>It was the stone. It filled his mind all at once in a rush. The Grozmok stone stood out in a void of blackness. Its power radiated out from it like black sunlight. Sparks of energy traced over the ancient dark runes carved on its surface. It growled low in his mind, calling for beings of evil to unite in an old and horrible language. Beings of evil, vampires, orcs, demons, and the minions of the undead bubbled up to the surface of Norrath like infected boils.</p>

    <p>Loral shot awake but the vision was not broken. Three thoughts became as clear as glass. The stone was alive. The stone was near. The stone must be destroyed.</p>

    <p>On the chair across from Loral's bed, the burning shield sat quietly.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 48: Takish Hiz</h2>
  
    <p>Elebrad looked to his fellow geomancers for support but found little. The four mages, older than him by more than forty years, stared at the doorway in front of them with grim faces and dead eyes.</p>

    <p>A crash and a deep rumble from outside the door grabbed Elebrad's attention. The ornate walls of the room shook. He saw the hands of Galoniel, his teacher and master, shaking. The thundering of huge footsteps approached the door, each louder and deeper than the last. Elebrad's nerves crawled in his arms. Panic swelled in his stomach. He felt nauseous.</p>

    <p>"Steady." Elebrad looked to his mentor. Galoniel's eyes were bright and he smiled. "We have lived good lives. We defend our city from the enemies of Fire and Hate. Many old men on their deathbeds would give their whole lives to be where we are now."</p>

    <p>Elebrad's stomach calmed. He felt a serenity flow into him. Death was inevitable. He would die in a few minutes but so had thousands who did not die as well as he would. A tear fell down his tan cheek. He did not want to die.</p>

    <p>The door exploded. Black acidic gas poured around the five mages but their spells of protection held. The beast entered. Torches and light crystals reflected off of its black shining scales.</p>

    <p>Elebrad had never seen a dragon before. It was smaller than he imagined but when its burning green eyes fell on him, he wanted to flee. The wyrm opened its mouth revealing rows of shining teeth and screamed. Pain exploded in Elebrad's head and he felt blood run from his left ear.</p>

    <p>"Now!"</p>

    <p>Each of the geomancers held their arms to their sides and chanted the words that had never been said. The dragon roared again and raked a foul claw into the third mage in the half circle, Frolmeia the Greyhand. Horrible wounds in the elf's abdomen spilled the wizard's organs onto the floor but the power of the spell would not stop.</p>

    <p>The ground exploded into a column of earth and dust. Elebrad saw nothing but a sea of sand . His skin cracked and the dust filled his lungs. The roar of the storm dwarfed the shrieks of the dragon. When it settled no movement or sound broke the dead silence of the chamber. Five figures of stone sat around the petrified black dragon, stuck with its mouth screaming and wings wide forever.</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>The demon stood massive on the scorched earth. He looked through the visor of his planar helm, enchanted by the darkest wizards of hell to give him sight in the brightest day and darkest nights.  Beyond physical sight, the helm allowed Xuzl to see into the souls of mortals.  Good or bad, powerful or weak, Xuzl saw all.</p>

    <p>Jagged plates of enchanted steel armored his left shoulder and arm. He stood fifteen feet high on twisted black hooves.  Thick red skin covered his massive muscled frame.  His extended wings stretched thirty feet across.</p>

<p>In his hand, Xuzl carried Kathramg the Soulburner.  The serrated sword, filled with the essence of a demon even older than Xuzl, dripped with evil.  Black flames writhed off of the sword's runed blade.  For two hundred years the lich-demons of Fire forged the weapon.  Now, in the demon's hand, it bathed in the blood of five hundred elves.</p>

<p>The world of Norrath never felt an evil as strong as the demon general.  All mortal beings that saw the demon unleashed on Norrath felt their hearts sink.  Even the dark elf wizards who summoned the demon and his minions questioned their decision.</p>

<p>Xuzl turned to the small figure standing next to him.</p>

    <p>"The Wyrm has failed. The geomancers have sealed off the corridors and filled their blood with sand." The demon's booming voice rattled the bones of the hooded dark elf wizard that leaned on his long runed staff. "They have sealed us off from the rest of the city."</p>

    <p>"What shall we do, Bloodlord Xuzl?" The wizard's ancient voice cracked but held authority and confidence even when speaking to the demon-prince of Fire. Few mortals had the courage to address the demon at all.</p>

    <p>"Bury it." Xuzl turned and the arch-wizard glimpsed the blazing green eyes of the demon from within the depths of Xuzl's war-helm. "Bury them."</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>Loral stood above the swirling sandpit that led to the ruins of Takish Hiz. The wayfarers gave Loral the general directions but the burning of the shield was all the confirmation he needed. The cursed shield, a piece of the demon-lord Xuzl, knew where the elves had fallen. He knew where Loral's ancestors fought and died to protect the city of Takish Hiz. Xuzl should know these things.  The demon had been there.</p>

    <p>Xuzl enjoyed feeding memories into the elven cleric in dreams and visions. The massive demon enjoyed feasting on the elves of Takish Hiz. Xuzl commanded Solusek Ro's demon army when the dark elves summoned them from the depths of Fire. Xuzl swept across the black cloud-filled skies of eastern Tunaria armored in the finest enchanted armor and wielding Kathramg.  Xuzl filled Loral's mind with a vision of the demon gliding fast over the ground and hewing an unwary scout in half at the waist before the young elf knew what hit him.  The wake of an ocean of blood followed in the path of the grinning armored demon.  The blood of a thousand more would splash on the burning steel of Xuzl's armor before the end.</p>

    <p>But then he fell. Xuzl never showed Loral how that had happened. Loral's dreams ended with the demon standing on a scorched hill overlooking the burning ruins of Eiddar Forest.</p>

    <p>Now Loral stood in the same place. His golden armor gleamed under the burning sun and his enchanted hammer hung heavy in his hand. He turned to his companions and then back to the sand vortex in front of him. With a prayer to Tunare, Loral leaped into the pit.</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf recognized the seal on the letter at once but its delivery method gave him a strong clue. Loral still used the Antonican Bards when all of Yeolarn's other priests used wizards and the new Wayfarer agents to deliver their reports.</p>

    <p>Yeolarn sat in his thick oak chair and broke the seal on the letter. The first words hit the five hundred year old elf like a hammer.</p>

    <p>Elves still live in Takish Hiz.</p>

    <p>The golems did not surprise me. They had been commanded to stop any intruder. We intruded but did so five hundred years after the geomancers expected anyone to enter Takish Hiz.</p>

    <p>The geomancers live. They became something else after five hundred years under the sand. Sand flows through their body like blood. Their eyes shine like burning emeralds. They command the same mysterious power they had when the city fell. Their minds are broken.</p>

    <p>They fight a war against Ro and the Dark Elves that ended centuries ago. They see no difference between the hellish knights of Ro and the elves of Felwithe. They are not spectres or demons or golems. These are our ancestors. They fight with a power lost to us and they fight as though the invasion of Takish Hiz continues.</p>

    <p>We killed them.</p>

    <p>I know that the Felwithe council cannot tell what we have found in Takish Hiz. I wish I did not know myself. The people of Felwithe will be told that the armies of Ro and Innoruuk have filled the ruins of Takish Hiz with demons and spirits. They must be told this. The truth is too painful and answers no questions.</p>

    <p>I tell you this truth because someone else must know. My hands bathed in the blood of our fathers this night.</p>

    <p>Tunare Help Us.</p>

    <p>Loral</p>

  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 49: The Rescue</h2>
  
<p>There is no horror worse than to stare with mortal eyes into the depths of hell.  The mortal mind cannot grasp beyond the horizons of pure evil.  We have born and died in a world of balance; a world of black and white and gray.  The people we meet are not pure definitions of good or evil.  Anger and revenge filled every paladin's heart at one time or another.  Love touched the dark heart of a necromancer, though small that touch may have been.  Our people walk a rope of good and evil.  It is why the gods watch us.  It is how we grow.</p>

<p>But around our world, in the cracks and seams of our lives, there is a darker world.  There are many dark worlds.  There is Disease; there is Nightmare; there is War; there is Fire.  There is Torment.</p>

<p>Torment's webwork of steel and stone stretch through a sky of blood over waters thick and black.  Torment cries and laughs in the heart of despair.  To look upon it is to feel the crushed spirit of hopelessness.  To see the twisted beasts walking the labyrinth of its web-like sprawl is to see true horror.  Few mortals see the devastation of Torment.  Few ever escape its clutches.  There are a few, however, who have felt the steel-barbed whip of Torment. Lost souls fall through the seams of life and into eternal pain and despair. Twisted beasts of coarse fur, yellow tusks, maws of white poisonous fangs and cloven hooves roar and rip into the mortals trapped in this prison world.</p>

<p>Time has no meaning in the demi-plane of Torment.  Sometimes it gushes in a black river.  Other times it is a single red drop of blood falling for centuries.  A denizen of Torment cannot say how long it has been since mortals entered the red world freely.  It is not frequent.  So it was a surprise to see six mortals step through the white crackling rift that tore a wound through space and time.  As much as it surprised the demons of Torment, the fury of their attack surprised them even more.</p>

<p>The crack of lightning shows the twisted walkways as the rift tears open time and space.  On the backdrop of black and red the six mortals show blue and gold and silver.  They show no fear of the world they entered.  They hold weapons themselves forged in the planes.  They are Planewalkers, adventurers familiar with the outer worlds and they came with purpose.</p>

<p>For centuries, Gtzzg walked the impossibly suspended walkways of Torment.  He crushed bones in his huge hands and ripped into the soft skin of thousands.  His yellow eyes gleamed and his thick hair stood up on his massive shoulders.  He was the first to attack these intruders.  He wanted them before the other demons; the sightless screaming telepathic ravens, the tentacled constructs, or the wolves; got to them.</p>

<p>Gtzzg roared his psychic roar and held his massive claws out as he rushed in.  None in the party moved.  He reached the group of mortals but never landed a blow. A mace, gleaming white with internal power and forged to battle just such a beast, smashed into the demon's skull.  Plates of bone and gushing black blood splashed onto the ancient stone walkway.  The mace crushed half of the demon's mind.  He couldn't see out of one eye.  His mouth opened in protest to this impossible situation when the mace came in again.  The demon knew no more.</p>

<p>The adventurers hit Torment like a white hot scythe.  They hewed and cleaved through dozens of the Plane's demons.  The six mortals sprinted through fountains of spraying black blood, severed limbs, and the tainted smoldering ruins of their foes.  Arrows streaked silver across the dark red sky, tearing demonic ravens out of the air one after another.  The mortals ran with purpose, navigating the twisted walkways as the demons of the Plane did.</p>

<p>They ran into a smaller of the plane's cell blocks, a huge block of black stone carved with images of torture and pain.  Two guards, massive wolf-headed beasts with horns protruding from their backs and shoulders, held their ground.  They saw the rush of the adventurers and prepared their telepathic attacks.</p>

<p>A dozen arrows tore into the face and chest of one, blinding him.  A bolt of lightning crashed into the other, sending it into convulsions.  The cruel demon-slaying mace smashed into the jaw of the electrocuted wolf-demon sending its teeth back into its head.  A slice of flashing silver, the thin edge of a heavily enchanted blade, cut through the neck of the other blinded demon and deep into the wall behind it.  The head spun through the air, over the edge of the walkway, and tumbled into the black water hundreds of feet below.</p>

<p>The swing of an enchanted hammer smashed the steel door into pieces.  White light poured into a room that only knew darkness.  A figure, tiny and broken, cowered away from the light.  The thin figure was naked and pale.</p>

<p>Loral stepped into the cell.  His golden armor shined with an internal fire.  His white hair hung in his face matted with sweat.  Black blood covered his silver hammer in his right hand and sizzled off of the burning shield attached to his left.  He went to the figure in the corner, dropping his hammer and placing his hand on the figure's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'm here, father."  Loral's voice cracked and a tear cut a clean path down his grimy face.  He gently embraced the figure who did not return it.</p>

<p>"It's time to go home."</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">EQ Newsletter: Recruitment</h2>
  
    <p>Note: This short story appeared in the July 2004 Everquest newsletter.</p>

    <p>Tiim watched the shoppers of the Freeport market as he always did on Saturday mornings. The exotic scents of a hundred different spices filled his nostrils. Dozens of the market's shoppers milled about the stalls, some from the soft and fat noble class, others rough and lean adventurers.</p>

    <p>Tiim watched the purses of these shoppers carefully. A coin or two from time to time might fall through careless fingers and Tiim must grab them if he wished to eat. If he became desperate enough he would have to cut the purse strings himself. To be caught in such an act meant losing his hands. A boy like Tiim needed his hands if he didn't want to starve.</p>

    <p>Tiim's eyes shifted to the pair of armored guards who scanned the people strolling by. Those near the guards kept their heads down and eyes forward. The tall guards, armored in steel breastplates, greaves, and bucket helms, kept their eyes out for people like Tiim.</p>

    <p>Most people have an ability to sense when they are being watched. When they feel eyes on them, even from behind, a person will turn and look without even knowing what they are looking for. A boy in Tiim's line of work, the work of thievery, knew this sense well. Tiim never looked directly at the guards or any other person.</p>

    <p>Tiim had further honed this sense. He didn't only know when he was being watched but when others were being watched as well. Someone else was watching the guards. Someone close. Tiim slowly turned and saw a figure studying the guards.</p>

    <p>The man was tall. A gray cloak and hood covered his face. Tiim saw the man's scruffy chin in the light of the morning sun. Two pinpoints of light reflected off of the man's eyes from within the shadow of the man's hood. Tiim made out the dull gleam of a mail shirt under the stranger's cloak. The man wore tall soft leather brown boots heavily seamed and coated in the dust of the road.</p>

    <p>The man turned his head towards Tiim and the young thief's heart jumped. He had been carefully taking note of the stranger from the corner of his eye but the stranger had felt his gaze anyway. Tiim yawned, his natural protective response in moments of high stress. He looked down and dragged the toe of his tattered cloth sandal in the dirt. The ruse of relaxation seemed to work. The hooded stranger looked away and back to the guards.</p>

    <p>A scuffle at one of the merchant tents took the guards' attention and the cloaked man moved quickly. The stranger headed to an alley, attempting to escape from the marketplace. He might have made it if two other guards hadn't come out of the very alley the stranger hoped to escape to. It was pure bad luck.</p>

    <p>One of the guards recognized the cloaked man and shouted. The other reached out to grab the stranger by the front of his cloak. There was a flash of movement and instantly the guard was on the ground holding his deformed broken wrist to his chest.</p>

    <p>The other guard began to draw his sword but the stranger drew his own shining silver shortsword and cut out to the side with speed far beyond the clumsy guard. Tiim saw a ribbon of blood in the air and the second guard crumpled to the ground.</p>

    <p>Tiim always trusted his instincts even if they made no logical sense. His instincts had kept him alive for thirteen years and today they would change his life forever. Tiim felt this instinct like a needle stuck into his spine and began to move.</p>

    <p>The two other guards raced towards the stranger just as the second of the two guards from the alley fell. They shoved and punched their way through the crowd and hit the cloaked man hard. The stranger ducked into a ball and hit the first rushing soldier at the knee. Tiim heard the snap of the guard's dislocated knee and saw him somersault onto his back howling in pain. The second guard clipped the cloaked man in the jaw with an iron-gauntleted fist. That is when Tiim arrived.</p>

    <p>Tiim's rusty dagger served him well over his years on the street. It was a part of him and it was no surprise that he found it in his hand even though he had no memory of drawing it. Without slowing down, Tiim's hand slashed out. A leather pouch fell from the cloaked man's belt and into Tiim's waiting hand. Tiim disappeared into the crowd. He had just a moment to see the stranger drop to both knees and hamstring the fourth guard with his gleaming shortsword.</p>

    <p>Tiim ran for an hour using every secret passage and hidden alley he knew. He darted into sub-basements and alcoves. He ran under the docks past the unseeing gazes of Freeport's street dregs. Finally after running down his favorite darkened alley, Tiim stopped.</p>

    <p>There the cloaked man waited for him.</p>

    <p>The man had thrown back his hood and Tiim saw his red hair pulled back over his pointed ears. The stranger, a half elf if Tiim had to guess, had his hands comfortably on his hips. The shortsword, hilted in shining gold and jewels, sat on his left hip.</p>

    <p>"I've never seen hands as fast as yours." The man's voice was even and smooth. A thousand lies came to Tiim's lips but Tiim saw in the half-elf's blazing green eyes that no lie would take. He knew of only one way to survive this confrontation. He held out the leather pouch.</p>

    <p>"I never saw you coming and I see everything," said the half-elf plucking the pouch from Tiim's hand. "I have need of someone like you."</p>

    <p>The man smiled so warmly that Tiim's guard immediately fell. In his whole life no one had ever smiled to Tiim with such kindness and warmth. If he had not been an orphan he might have recognized the smile as one given to a child from a pleased parent.</p>

    <p>"How would you like to join the Antonican Bards?"</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 50: What Ever Happened to Tarlin Trueblade</h2>
  
    <p>Loral sat in the heavy wood chair running a finger along the grain of the worn table. A gray vacancy filled his eyes; his mind was a lifetime away.</p>     

    <p>The cold northern breeze slid in the tavern's window, bringing strange smells to Loral's nostrils. It had been two years since Loral last visited Qeynos. Even the air was different.</p>

    <p>Black blood from horrors beyond the world of Norrath stained and tarnished Loral's golden armor. A string of leather tied back his grey hair. His dirty left hand circled an untouched goblet of wine, the black scar of his palm a deep contrast to his pale skin. On his back sat the burning shield of Fire, the phylactery of Xuzl. Loral felt the demon smile even now.</p>

    <p>A wave of the cold northern wind blew in as a dark-skinned figure cloaked and hooded in blue opened the door and entered the tavern. He stepped towards Loral's table on soft hide sandals. A small silver medallion cut in the shape of a crescent moon hung around his neck and three red dots sat below his left eye. His skin had wrinkled and he walked with a slight limp but otherwise he was the same priest Loral met decades ago in Felwithe.</p>

    <p>Ciric sat down at the table, his eyes fixed on the golden-armored elf.</p>

    <p>"Your father is alive. Death will not find him for many years." Loral let out a breath he hadn't realized he held in. Ciric continued, his voice even and calm. "He is severely underfed. His muscles are weakened. He cannot stand. His left eye is blind."</p>

    <p>Loral's eyes filled with tears. He couldn't imagine what his father faced in the depths of Hate and Torment. No mortal ever survived for so long in places like that.</p>

    <p>"He hasn't spoken. He doesn't yet seem to recognize this place." Ciric put his hand over Loral's wrist. "We are taking care of him, my friend. We will take care of him as long as we have to."</p>

    <p>"Now tell me how you found him."</p>

    <p>Loral looked up, light streaks of pale skin drawn from his eyes down to the side of his mouth.</p>

    <p>"Xuzl told me." Loral let the words hang in the air while he watched his mentor's reaction. These three words could have the priest excommunicated from the church if not executed as a heretic. If any one man understood the pain behind these words, it was Ciric. Loral reached into a pouch at his belt and drew out a small leather-bound book.</p>

    <p>"I found this in the library of Tanaan. It is my father's journal." Loral kept his hand over the small journal. "He began writing it when he joined the Emerald Guardians of Telethin over four hundred years ago.</p>

    <p>"It seemed my father had many of the same problems with his kingdom that I have with mine. Many were slain by his hand under the order of loyalty and valor. He quickly lost stomach for it.</p>

    <p>"During the wars of Telethin he drew his blades again. When the elves reached Faydwer he fought with the armies of Kelethin against the goblins and orcs that wished to send the elves back into the sea. His tale ended but I have more journals to discover.</p>

    <p>"Xuzl learned of my father as he invaded my dreams. He sent his agents of Fire far and wide to find anything he could use against me. He found much.</p>

    <p>"Over one hundred years ago a plane-walker broke into a church in the Plane of Hate and stole an artifact of the dark priests of Innoruuk. The rogue returned to Norrath with the artifact and hoped to sell it but the danger of the artifact grew in his mind and he sold it to my father for copper.</p>

    <p>"The dark priests called fourth a creature of Hate, filling a cauldron with their own lifeblood and once released, this agent of Rancor began hunting down this hammer.</p>

    <p>"Tall and covered in leathery blue skin, the agent of Hate hunted across the lands with burning red eyes under his black cloak and hood. He carried a long jagged shard of metal from another world. Leather from the skin of a wyrm wrapped its handle.</p>

    <p>"The cloaked agent strode past the guards of Felwithe like a cold shadow. My father never stood a chance.</p>

    <p>"My father found himself in the shadowed world of Hate, hearing whispers of paranoia that blew through the iron city like a chilled wind. The demonic hunter smiled over jagged pointed teeth when he saw the pain and fright in my father. The agent of Innoruuk plunged his long dagger into my father's heart.</p>

    <p>"Death is strange in the Planes. With so many ways to travel, death comes differently to all. For my father, death was exile. The hunter threw his broken body into a pile of others that rotted on every street corner of the dark city of Hate.</p>

    <p>"Some, when they face death, are judged by the even hand of the Tribunal. Some, however, find themselves lost in the chaos and horror of Saryn's cells in the Plane of Torment. There is no justice there, no judgment. There is only pain and misery. That is where Xuzl found my father.</p>

    <p>"Xuzl is old and his spy network is vast. There is little information he cannot find. He was surprised to find my father alive, deep in the cells of Torment. He was surprised and delighted.</p>

    <p>"Even the twisted horror-masters of Torment didn't know why my father was there. This didn't stop them from breaking him apart and rebuilding him every day for one hundred years. Xuzl's spies found him there, broken and drained of every ounce of life.</p>

    <p>"Xuzl saw the state my father was in and knew the pain it would cause me to see him that way. He also knew it was the only way he could get what he wanted."</p>

    <p>"What is that?" Ciric's voice sounded strange after Loral's description.</p>

    <p>"Release." Loral's eyes stayed on his drink. "He wants to be free upon Norrath again. He wants to feel the ground die under his feet. He wants the air to scream in protest against his very being." Loral looked up to his friend and mentor.</p>

    <p>"I accepted."</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 51: Tarlin and Taelosia</h2>
  
<p>Loral knew pain.  He had seen suffering and felt both physical and emotional pain many times in his travels.  None matched the pain he felt when he saw his father.</p>

<p>Ciric had told Loral that his father was in a coma.  Loral expected to see his father prone, eyes closed, in deep sleep.  What he saw was a man in pure agony.  Tarlin, his skin hanging loose over atrophied muscles and bones, writhed on the bed.  His mouth opened and closed in silent screams.  His eyes rolled back in his head as his head shook from side to side.  Loral always remembered his father as a tall proud elf, well muscled and a head of thick blond hair.  How his hair hung stringy and loose and his body lay broken.</p>

<p>Tears rolled down Loral's face.  He sat down next to Tarlin and put his hand over his father's hand.  He felt heat radiating off of him.  Tarlin's skin was yellow and glistening with sweat.  Loral felt his father's hand twist into a pained claw tearing at the bed.  Loral closed his eyes and whispered a prayer to Tunare.  Warmth flowed through him and he channeled it into Tarlin.  It rolled off of the broken figure like water over stone.  His father's state did not change.</p>

<p>Loral heard a light rapping at the door and Ciric entered.  Loral looked to his mentor, his eyes begging for help from the old Eruidite.</p>

<p>"Heal him."  Loral's voice cracked and fresh tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"My friend.  Your skills far surpass my own but there is nothing you or I can do for him."  Ciric's spoke in a voice low and even.  "He is not sick." Loral looked dumbfounded.  Ciric continued.  "No poison flows through his veins.  No disease eats at his organs.  There is nothing physically wrong with him that four months of hot meals and exercise would not solve.  Something eats at his mind.  His body and mind grew used to Torment; as used to it as any mortal mind can.  He faced horror you and I cannot ever dream of."</p>

<p>"How can we heal him?"  All of Loral's power and experience did nothing to take away the helplessness he felt.</p>

<p>"We can feed him.  We can keep him as comfortable as possible.  We can pray."</p>

<p>Loral looked at his longtime friend.  A feeling of helpless rage burned through him.  He looked at the Erudite and spoke two words sharp and powerful.</p>

<p>"Leave us."</p>

<p>Ciric turned to leave.  He closed the door and Loral heard his sandals on the hardwood floor of the small church.  While Ciric understood Loral's need for privacy, he did not understand that "us" meant "us three".</p>

<p>You can speak to him can't you?</p>

<p>Loral opened his mind and closed his eyes.  His mind expanded outward to the edges of the room.</p>

<p>YES.</p>

<p>The word filled Loral's head with red fire.  It was the voice of a thousand mouths, a voice of a thousand years.</p>

<p>What do you see?</p>

<p>Laughter fell upon Loral sharp as glass and heavy as stone.  Veins broke out on Loral's forehead.</p>

<p>PAIN.</p>

<p>Channel me to him.  Open his mind to me.</p>

<p>Silence greeted Loral's request.  Loral felt the burning shield on his back.  He felt the thick burning presence of the demon-lord, Xuzl within it.  He could feel the burning green eyes tearing holes into his back.  The laughter came again.</p>

<p>The world exploded.  Loral felt cold wind rip across his skin.  A claw dug into his neck.  His vision turned outside of himself and he saw a cloaked face, skin of blue and teeth like a shark.  Red eyes flashed and Loral felt a black jagged dagger rip through his chest.  Blackness filled his mind and he fell through the black stone floor under his feet into a sea of blood.  A world of blood awaited him.  Huge muscular arms covered in thick coarse hair picked him off of the ground, one of Loral's arms in each huge three-fingered hand.  He saw the face of a huge tusked boar, black saliva dripping and death screaming in the demon's eyes.  The demon pulled his arms apart.  Loral felt his muscles rip in his chest and shoulders.  He heard bones pop.  He felt skin tear.  Loral screamed.</p>

<p>The morning sun and a chilled breeze awoke Loral.  He sat up on a small bed and saw his robes and boots on a chair in the corner of a small room.  Outside the sounds of Qeynos set a contrast from the horrors of his visions.  He dressed in the green robe and stepped out into the halls of the church.  Ciric waited for him at a wooden table, a meal already prepared and waiting for the elven cleric.</p>

<p>"I don't know what happened to you but it knocked you unconscious for two days."  Ciric poured a cup of tea into a plain glass.  "Whatever you did, don't do it again."</p>

<p>"I had to try something."  Loral's weak voice brought concern to Ciric's eyes.  "He had been there before."  Loral sipped his tea and grimaced as it burned down his throat.  "To Hate, I mean.  I saw it.  Sometime during the first battles of Kelethin, my father fought Innoruuk's hoards."  Loral fixed his firey blue eyes on his old teacher.  "My father was a demonslayer."</p>

<p>"I tried to help him but I could not.  Saryn's torture-masters broke him under their cloven hooves.  I don't know if he will ever feel peace again."  Loral's head dipped.  "Until he dies."</p>

<p>The words hung in the air.  The implication made Ciric's shoulders sag.  He lifted a parchment sealed in black wax and handed it to Loral.</p>

<p>"This arrived for you yesterday.  It came through the sewers."  Loral looked up at the tone in Ciric's voice.  Both Loral and Ciric knew what it meant.  For years, rumors spoke of a cult of Bertoxxulous infesting the sewers of Qeynos.  Dark rites and the disappearances of children fed these rumors to the people of Qeynos.  "You have shady friends, Loral.  Be wary."</p>

<p>As a young acolite of Quellious, Ciric traveled by foot from Erudin to Kaladim in a journey that took three weeks.  He traveled over two oceans, a half dozen forests, two mountain ranges, and dozens of open planes.  Two hundred years later, Loral made a similar journey in less than an hour.</p>

<p>Loral's mind stretched across the webwork of power that fell over Norrath like a net.  Thin lines of ethereal magic stretched from the cities to the hub of New Tanaan, a pocket universe in the center of the Plane of Knowledge.  Many of these thin lines crossed the hundreds of miles between distant cities.  One of these lines stretched far across the skies to the moon of Luclin.  Some lines, tainted with darkness and filled with black poison, pierced through the thin fabric of Norrath's world and into into the pits of the lower worlds.</p>

<p>The stones of Knowledge anchored the beams to the hub of Tanaan while the books of Knowledge, material icons or metaphors of the vast distance one traveled along the cords of etheria, anchored the thin beams to the material worlds they connected. It was the line from Qeynos to Tanaan and from Tanaan to Shadowhaven that Loral sought this day.  </p>

<p>Loral looked at the strange book and stone pillar that sat like a splinter of another world through the green earth of Qeynos.  He imagined the thin lines stretching through a black universe of emptiness, a void of chaos.  Creatures beyond mortal comprehension whispered within those voids, threatening to slice the cords and send travelers into the waiting arms of a cold black hell.  Loral remembered a time not so long past when rumors spoke of the lines snapping.  The protective currents of the streams of knowledge snapped like threads.  Some awoke hours from their destinations.  Some awoke buried half within the earth, their organs burst and legs shattered from the earth and stone around them.  Some poor souls never returned at all.  To travel in the outer worlds risked the worst forms of death or banishment imaginable.</p>

<p>These grim thoughts followed Loral as he approached Qeynos's book of Knowledge.  The book shimmered in front of him.  He never liked using these strange artifacts, but like all of Norrath's adventurers, they quickly became too useful to pass up.  He read a strange book describing this planar travel, a book that described it in one word:  Todash.</p>

<p>The otherworld word sat on his lips as he placed his hands on the book and felt the world shift and shatter around him.  The cord pulled and a thousand miles passed by in seconds.</p>

<p>Minutes later, Loral arrived at the city of Shadowhaven deep within the moon of Luclin.</p>

<p>It was quiet in Shadowhaven's most popular inn and tavern.  The opening of the paths to the outer worlds sent most stout adventurers away from the  mysterious lands of Luclin.  Chairs sat upside down on the large thick tables.  Five or six patrons drank thick strange drinks after hard battles in the nearby hostile caverns of Paludal.  Their young age never ceased to surprise Loral.</p>

<p>"I was never so young," Loral whispered to himself.</p>

<p>A single figure sat in the corner of the bar where the shadows grew thickest.  The figure pulled back a black hood revealing the smooth bald head of a dark elf.  The dark elf gave Loral a smile that made the priest's skin crawl.</p>

<p>As he approached the dark elf, Loral became aware of how quiet it became.  It felt like a deep buzzing that quivered subconsciously in his mind ceased to buzz.  A clarity filled his mind.</p>

<p>The dark elf lifted one of his high soft leather boots and pushed a char out with its pointed toe.  Loral saw the short blade that hung low from the rogue's wide leather belt and a pair of dagger hilts sat comfortably in the tops of both boots.</p>

<p>"You look tired."  The dark elf's low guttural voice sounded like the hiss of a lizard preparing to strike a wounded animal.</p>

<p>"I've little time for chatter, Xarrak.  What do you have for me?"  Xarrak stretched his arms behind his back and Loral saw two more daggers strapped hilt downward on Xarrak's wrists.  Loral imagined that the rogue could send those two daggers twirling through the air before an eye could blink.</p>

<p>"Much has happened in your soft elven kingdom.  Mordin Rasp's agents stretch far, even into the circle of the council."  The thin rogue tipped lightly back in his chair, balancing only on two of the thin legs.  "The Wayfarer's attention strayed from the five lost dungeons.  Mordin Rasp commissioned a marvelous ship, huge and expensive."</p>

<p>"How did he fund it?"</p>

<p>"A year ago Rasp stumbled upon Nagafen's lost hoard.  It took him months to extract it all but once he did he had enough for his network of spies, his coven of magi, his five Wayfarer camps and the treasure they reward to the hapless adventurers who follow this barbarian like cattle to the slaughter.  Now he uses it to fund this ship."</p>

<p>"What does he want?"</p>

<p>"The Wayfarers sail west.  They found a new land, a land that sits between worlds.  There, a race of small elvish folk known as the Taelosians fight a hoard of powerful out-worlders called the Muramites."</p>

<p>Loral rolled his finger in the air beckoning the rogue to skip ahead.  Xarrak stopped speaking, letting the silence sit between them.</p>

<p>"He has the Grozmok stone."</p>

<p>Loral's eyes widened.  A chill flowed throug his veins like ice water.  Visions of the stone's dark power filling the Trolls of Grobb with their dark powers, twisting the Frogloks of Guk into horrible malformations of their once noble selves, and breaking open the pits of vampires that now infested Faydwer like an infected wound.  The stone was responsible for death and destruction and horror for a thousand years.  And now it was in Mordin Rasp's hands.</p>

<p>"Where."  The word slipped out of Loral's mouth in a low whisper.  Xarrak smiled.  The rogue sat silent until Loral's patience was at an end.  Just before the cleric exploded in rage, Xarrak spoke.</p>

<p>"On the ship.  Rasp uses it to find these new lands."</p>

<p>"The fool!"  Loral's shout sent the few eyes of the tavern his way and he quieted.</p>

<p>"The stone should be broken apart and scattered across the pits of the lower worlds.  It is an artifact of evil for evil.  The barbarian will bring ruin on us all."  Loral's shoulders sank.  "Who knows what horrors lurk in those dark lands, horrors awakening to the stone's dark wail."</p>

<p>"Indeed."  The dark elf slipped a long fingered hand towards Loral, a folded parchment magically appearing from the shadows of his palm.  "Your orders from the church.  I took the liberty of bringing them myself.  Those messengers of Felwithe are born into incompetence.</p>

<p>"And what do the orders say?"</p>

<p>"You will travel west with Rasp's crew.  You will travel to Taelosia."</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Chapter 52: The Abysmal Seas</h2>
  
<p>Cold wind ripped across the waves bringing with it a wall of rain.  The sheet of rain smashed across the wooden deck of the ship and over the cloaked figure, but he did not move.  A flash of lightning broke open the horizon of black clouds and black seas revealing intense blue eyes under the gray cloak of the stranger.</p>

<p>Loral Ciriclight, priest of Tunare, stood on the ship's deck, ignoring the tearing wind and cold rain.  He was an elf transformed.  His hair hung in thick strands down the front of his shoulders from under his hood.  He held his cloak tight around his body as the wind ripped through him.  Lighting crashed again and the huge boat creaked sending a flood of rainwater across the deck.  Loral's eyes never moved.</p>

<p>Two huge barbarians covered in spiked steel armor and carrying great-swords almost as tall as Loral stood guard over the focus of Loral's intense gaze.  Between them was the Grozmok stone.  For centuries the huge stone served demons and gods long dead.  For centuries it lead to the twisting and destruction of countless beings across countless worlds.  And now it was here on this boat in this storm.</p>

<p>Strange magic kept the huge slab afloat over its pedestal.  Loral saw horrible glyphs and sigils carved on its surface from a dark language beyond the realms of Norrath.  No word of this language ever spread across the lands.  No mortal tongue could ever hope to articulate the impossible multi-voiced syllables of the ancient language.  The guttural and deep words would hew into the minds of those who heard it, spreading like black poison and tearing away all moral and rational thought.  Men pierced the throats of their families under the orders of such words, spilling the blood of their loved ones onto the insatiable stone.  Lightning crashed again and Loral closed his eyes.</p>

<p>The two guards turned to the cloaked figure that stood in the storm and watched it stride forward.  Time appeared to slow.  The figure's hard boots thudded on the deck above the steady roar of the falling rain. The figure drew a  hand from within its cloak and traced a sign of Tunare in the air with two fingers.  His powerful decisive stride never stopped.  A flash of light erupted from within the folds of the figure's gray cloak.  The two barbarians placed their hands on the hilts of their huge swords.</p>

<p>The larger of the two guards began to draw his sword but before six inches of the steel blade left it sheath, a twisting cord wrapped around his wrist, waste, feet, and throat.  It tore him into the railing of the ship's deck and he screamed against another crash of lightning.  The other drew his own huge blade in a fast practiced draw.  He took no chances.</p>

<p>The unhindered guard cut hard in a horizontal slash that should have severed the cloaked figure in half.  The figure turned, putting his back against the blade's cut and although the blade cut into the figure's gray cloak, it shattered like glass against the shield the figure wore on his back.  A deep and low roar swept across the ship's deck.  Red flames leaped up from the cut in the figure's cloak.  </p>

<p>The figure's cloak whipped back and revealed a shining hammer in his hand.  The cloaked attacker smashed the head of the hammer into the guard's chest and with a crash of magical energy.  The cloaked figure drew back and then threw his hand forward hard as if tossing a huge stone.  Another deep thud sounded across the ship as blast of magical energy slammed into the guard, shattered the thick wooden railing, and sent him soaring onto lower deck below.</p>

<p>The figure leaped up onto the remaining railing holding his shining hammer high in one hand and a burning shield in the other.  Below his feet the Grozmok stone whispered in a dark tongue.  The figure smashed his hammer into the center of the stone.  The Grozmok stone exploded in black and white fire, shattering into dust.</p>

<p>Lighting cut again across the gray storm clouds and the boat rocked again tearing Loral from the vision of his attack.  How dearly he wished to destroy the accursed stone.  How much pain should Norrath continue to suffer?  The dark stone twisted the trolls of Grobb into unholy spiritcallers and destroyed the city of Guk.  Rumors spoke to the stone's participation in the surfacing of the orcs of Rujarkian.  The stone was a compass of death.  It dragged its followers into the pits of hell and it would do so again attached to this massive ship.</p>

<p>Loral became aware of silence in his mind.  Xuzl, demon imprisoned in Loral's burning shield, never missed such opportunities to torment the elven cleric.</p>

<p>"Why do you not speak, Demon," thought Loral.  Xuzl's words returned like a thin hiss, far different from the mental roar of flame he normally spoke through.</p>

<p>There is nothing to say.  Ware the stone, priest.</p>

<p>"What do you know of this thing?"  The voice of the demon prince flowed through Loral's mind much smoother and lower than it ever had.  It was a powerful contrast from the demon's normally overpowering voice.</p>

<p>Only a handful of such items exist across the known worlds.  Their power is endless, eviscerating worlds and spilling their entrails upon the open vastness that lies in between.  None know where such things are created.  They outgrow even those who build them.  Some say they are built from within the ethereal voids where not even the demon-princes dare to look.  Leave this place, priest.</p>

<p>Xuzl's words surprised Loral.  Even in his defeat at the hands of the adventurers of Lotus Cult, Xuzl never showed fear until now.</p>

<p>Loral turned and looked back across the crashing seas.  The clouds themselves seemed alien to Loral, as though the great ship of the Wayfarers had itself traveled across the rifts of Norrath and into unknown worlds.  Whatever awaited him on the shores to the west, Loral could only hope he would be ready.</p>

<p>The howling winds of the storm brought a cry to Loral's ears.  The ship's watchman sighted land.  A cold shiver flowed through Loral's veins as a whispered prayer to Tunare left his lips.  The gates of discord had opened, and chaos reigned within.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Dauleroun Alines walked slowly down the streets of Felwithe in the darkness of the late night.  The elven councilman's hard-soled boots echoed off of the stone pavement, the only sound in the deep night.  His pale skin sagged at his cheeks and neck; many in the council noted that the conservative voice of the council looked far older these last few days.  It was due to stress, no doubt, after the recent news and omens of war.</p>

<p>Shadows bent and twisted across the blue stone walkway and across the alleys of the closed shops.  The shadows flanked and followed the councilman as he made his way to his posh apartment in North Felwithe.</p>

<p>The councilman waved a hand past a red glyph on the stone door of his apartments.  The rune shifted to green and magical forces pushed the rumbling stone into a hidden compartment.  When the councilman entered, the door closed behind him.  The shadows, however, followed him inside.</p>

<p>Alines waved his hand again, and spoke a single word in elder Elvish.  A fire burst into life in his hearth, illuminating the room.  A low voice from the shadows of the room whispered in a much older and darker voice.  The fire died low in the hearth.  Alines turned and faced the dark corner.</p>

<p>All of the shadows of the small room twisted and turned, shifting and drawing in.  Chilled wind flowed through the room blowing papers off of Aline's old desk and whipping the room's drapes and table cloths like the wings of bats.  The shadows came together in one spot and filled out a tall humanoid shape.  Red eyes blazed from the shadows and the vampire lord stepped into the light.</p>

<p>"Speak."  The vampire's voice was low and smooth.  The red eyes shifted through the full spectrum of light from red to violet and back, finally settling on a burning green.</p>

<p>"Lord Varlow."  Alines's confident voice broke apart as he spoke the name of the vampire lord who had taken him. "I did as you asked.  The emissaries, scouts, and adventurers head west across the Abysmal Seas following the agents of the Wayfarers.  We sent word to all of our field agents."</p>

<p>"And the priest?"  Varlow's hands slid from within his pitch black robes.  The long fingers ended in sharp thick nails.</p>

<p>"He travels west as well."</p>

<p>"Excellent."  The vampire lord's green eyes looked behind Councilman Alines.  "Glave, You know what to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, my master."  The hissing voice sent bolts of electricity through the elven councilman.  Alines whipped around to behold a shadowed figure less than two feet from his exposed back.  </p>

<p>Like Varlow, the figure had white skin but unlike the other vampire, tiny sigils, glyphs, and runes covered nearly every inch of this figure's skin .  His eyes were pure black orbs that shone in the dim flashes of the firelight.  He wore a flat black tunic and black trousers tucked into tall heavily creased boots.  A cloak draped over his sholders and a low hood covered the shade's bald tattooed head.  A pair of daggers, hilted in silver and adorned with black pearls, hung on the creature's wide black belt.  The pitch black eyes focused on the shaken councilman and the vampire shade smiled revealing horrible pointed teeth.</p>

<p>"Leave us."</p>

<p>The vampire shade, Glave, smiled again at the councilman and stepped toward the door.  Glave turned sideways and seemed to fold into a thin line before floating through the crack of the door.</p>

<p>The shocking site of something so unnatural faded and the councilman turned back to the elder vampire.</p>

<p>"What of me now?"</p>

<p>"One day you may serve me as well as Glave.  It took him five centuries to earn my trust and enter my inner circle."  The vampire smiled, his long teeth glistening.  "For now, you serve me here."</p>
  



<h1>Essays on Everquest</h1>


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Loral Ciriclight's Guide to Raiding</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 5 January 2002</p>

  

        
      

      <p>This guide helps outline the requirements for leading a large Everquest raid.</p>

      <p>There are three general rules you must follow when leading a raid, if you take anything away from this guide, take these rules with you.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Plan all aspects of your raid well ahead of time</li>

        <li>Make clear decisions and goals and stick to them for the duration of your raid</li>

        <li>Delegate portions of the raid to trustworthy advisors</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Make sure the goal of the raid is planned out in advance. State it clearly and plainly on your advertisement and state it again before the raid starts. Do not deviate from your plan no matter how many people ask you to. If you have a goal and it is achievable, go for that goal only. If you DO change direction, do it quickly and firmly. Do not ask the whole raid for their opinion, talk to trusted advisors if you need to make a change and when the change is made, follow through with it. Firmness is very important on these raids. Don't be nasty, but people will be far more likely to run into battle if they know there is a plan and a goal.</p>

      <p>Practice leading raids on lower level dungeons or overland areas where disasters are limited. Once you have a good feel for how to lead a raid, take it to bigger dungeons. Unrest is a great place to start. Everyone above 20 knows that dungeon really well and any level 50 player can roam almost freely to drag corpses or defeat troublesome mobs. There are many mid level dungeons that can be used where adventure is high but risk of disaster is low. Use these places to get a feel for leading a raid before stepping up to the larger dungeons.</p>

      <h2>Preparation (One week before the raid)</h2>

      <p>At least a week before any raid can begin, a leader must do the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Find a location and learn as much as possible about it including maps, loot lists, and hands on experience.</li>

        <li>Plan a goal for the raid.</li>

        <li>Advertise the raid on various guild bulletin boards and in game.</li>

        <li>State the raid's specific purpose, loot rules, and who can attend.</li>
      </ul>

      
        
      

      <p>The first step in leading a successful raid is proper planning. This means scheduling and advertising the raid well in advance of the time you will run it. It is difficult to get that perfect number of players who attend, you will either get too few or too many so plan ahead on how you go about advertising. If you invite multiple guilds to attend, expect a good number of players, but if you make the level restriction high, expect fewer. If you do a sign up, you can have a better idea for how many and what classes you expect, but risk not having people show and having to scramble at the last minute. The majority of raids I run are open invitation, not sign up, so whoever shows up can join. This makes group building more difficult as new players will be showing up while you are building groups and will come in and drop out during the actual raid.</p>

      <p>A wise adventurer once told me that he hunted Sebilis to get enough experience that when he died on raids he didn't care. He had accepted the most likely outcome of a traditional raid. Raids are not meant to get your character up to level 60 or to give you the latest 20,000 plat item. They are meant to defeat creatures that cannot be defeated by normal groups. If you want experience and loot, go to Sebilis. Raids exist to have fun. This should be made clear to all who plan to attend your raid. With up to 40 people, the odds of good loot and good experience are slim. Standard can-and-will-use loot rules are always a good idea to establish when you announce your raid and before the raid begins.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>Part of the planning is making sure you know the area you are raiding very well. If you are leading a raid into Kaesora, make sure you know that dungeon like the back of your hand. Spend a lot of time adventuring there, read the maps and keep them with you. Bring along experts who can lead your groups through the twisting corridors and help you avoid traps. The more you know the dungeon, the better your raid will be. While it is possible to raid a dungeon you haven't been to before, it is far more likely to end in disaster if you don't know exactly what you are doing or where you are going. Maps can only take you so far, nothing beats personal experience. Web sites like Allakhazam's and EQ Maps can give you a lot of good background material for raids.</p>

      <h2>Delegation (Two hours before the raid)</h2>

      <p>Proper delegation is the key to a solid raid.  Assign these roles to trusted volunteers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Loot Master: This person will make sure that all items are announced with stats and who will roll on it. They will handle all questions or problems as it relates to loot. Since loot is generally important in peoples minds, assign it to someone you know is capable of handling the issue. A loot master should have a good understanding, and ideally a list of what drops can occur.</li>

        <li>Transportation Officer: They coordinate the arrival of all those who wish to attend. The transportation officer is not solely responsible for moving people to the raid site, just making sure that they are on the way.  This job is best assigned to a druid or wizard.</li>

        <li>Puller / Scout: A monk and / or a rogue work well as scouts. They can pave a way through a dungeon, finding out what the various pulls will include. A fighter, paladin, shadowknight and ranger can also make good pullers. An experienced pull team is very important.</li>

        <li>Primary and Secondary Assist: Generally your biggest and toughest melee will act as the primary assist. Make sure to announce to all in attendance that they are to set up a hotbox to assist the primary assist. Should the primary die, have a secondary assist planned out.</li>

        <li>Advisors: Advisors are players that are experienced with the dungeon and with raiding. They will help give you information or make decisions but will not attempt to take control of the raid. Pick people you trust and have worked with before.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Assign people you know and trust in these roles and make sure it is clear to them what they need to do. This can cut a lot of the tells you will receive and allow you to coordinate the rest of the raid.</p>

      <h2>Groups</h2>

      <p>As you get closer to the actual raid, perform the following tasks about an hour before you scheduled the raid:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Assign a loot master, transportation officer, puller and scout, and a primary assist.</li>

        <li>Take a sheet of paper and list all the players with names, class and level.</li>

        <li>Build your command group including the puller, scout, and any advisors.</li>

        <li>Build all groups out of the list, include a healer for each group and mix up the classes so no one group is much more powerful than the others.</li>
      </ul>

      
        
      
			<p>Use a sheet of paper for your raid worksheet.  In a long list, write the names, classes and levels of the raiders.  Than begin to put them into five person groups.  As more raiders show up, or you find holes within the groups, the sixth slot in each group gives you room to move people around.  This sheet will be used throughout the raid</p>

      <p>The first group you must assemble when building a large raiding party is your command group. Your command group consists of the following roles; the raid leader, a scout, a puller and primary assist, raid advisors, and any accessory classes such as evacers, healers or mezzers. This group will act as the command team for the rest of the raid. It determines where the raid heads, and what mobs the raid pulls. This is the group that makes all the decisions as to where to go and what to kill.</p>

      <p>All other groups are support groups. They should include a mix of the following classes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Healers (mandatory) (Cleric, Druid, Shaman)</li>

        <li>Evacers (Druid, Wizard)</li>

        <li>Tanks (Warrior, Paladin, Shadowknight)</li>

        <li>Damage Dealers (Rogue, Wizard, Monk, Ranger, Warrior, Paladin, Shadowknight)</li>

        <li>Buffers / Debuffers (Shaman, Bard, Enchanter, Druid)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Other classes can fill out any group, but the two primary roles that must be filled are Healer and Evacer if you plan on evacing. While you shouldn't worry that a perfect distribution of kills is occurring across all your groups, try not to make one group alot more powerful than the others. The group leader is your primary point of contact with that group and you should seek feedback about that group from the leader. Have them assign a primary looter for that group and stick with it. Periodically through the raid, ask the group leader if his group is seeeing too little or too much experience, or find out about any other problems. Manachecks are also a good idea throughout the raid. The leader of the group should be someone you have worked with before, trust, and understand. Communication is a big key to a successful raid.</p>

      <h2>Beginning the Raid</h2>

      <p>As a raid begins, the leader should announce the following to those attending:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The goal of the raid</li>

        <li>Loot rules and name your lootmaster</li>

        <li>Groups using the "group number: LEADER member member member member member" format</li>

        <li>The primary and secondary assists, remind the group to use /assist target.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As a raid moves in, make sure to keep to the following guidelines</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start the raid on time. Only if you don't have enough to move should you stop.</li>

        <li>Do not stray from your initial goal.</li>

        <li>Make sure to stick to your original plans and loot rules.</li>

        <li>Roll on items quickly, upon the drop.</li>

        <li>Announce any group changes as you go, but do not change the groups unless you have to.</li>

        <li>Do not stop to invis more than one group. Any more than one group is too likely to have an invis failure on the way and force a battle you weren't ready for.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Corpse Recovery</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Plan on the worst disaster you can imagine</li>

        <li>Have monks, rogues and necros ready to drag corpses</li>

        <li>Know where safe areas are to res.</li>

        <li>Inform the group leaders on the status of a corpse recovery</li>
      </ul>

      
        
      

      <p>The best raids can sometimes end up in a wipeout where every member is killed deep in the middle of a horrible dungeon. Make sure to plan ahead for such disasters. If you expect groups to evac their members out should a disaster strike, make sure it is clear to every group and to the evacer for that group. You are in charge of yelling evac, but group leaders need to tell you if their group is in serious trouble. Sometimes death is a better alternative to escape. Raids are sometimes brought back online easier if they are simply ressed where they lie. Make sure this is clear if this is the case. If death does occur, have a plan for dragging corpses to a safe area for resurrections, or have a lot of coffins handy. Monks and rogues make for great corpse recovery. Know the safe spots of the dungeon so you know where to drag to. Make sure the risk is known to the members of your raid before disaster strikes so they know exactly what they are getting into.</p>

      <h2>Ending the Raid</h2>

      <p>Follow these guidelines for ending a raid.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Have an ending time in mind as you plan your raid.</li>

        <li>Don't get greedy, end gracefully.</li>

        <li>Assign transport to each group</li>

        <li>Have all groups teleport out quickly, they can decide where they can go once you have left.</li>

        <li>Distribute any loot that was held to the end after you have left the area.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Probably one of the little known problems that frustrates me the most is getting everyone out of the raiding area quickly. Invariably groups stand around and discuss where they are going and who wants to end up where. Meanwhile big mobs start respawning and killing those who didn't leave on time. As the raid leader direct everyone to port to South Ro, and have them worry about where everyone wants to go from there. As a raid leader, you should be in the last group to leave so if there is any crisis you can take care of it personally.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Raiders Guide to North Kael</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 5 January 2002</p>

  
<p class="summary">A noble spy of Tunare gave his life so that the following information could be used by the Mother to protect the Plane of Growth from the Kromif. This guide will help to illuminate the mysterious area of Northern Kael. It covers the area of the Arena and the Temple of Rallos Zek. This guide can be used by any raiding party attempting to attack the Arena or Temple areas and is broken up by these areas.</p>

      <h2>Layout</h2>

      <p>The map below shows the layout of the northern areas of Kael. The red dots represent mob locations, the blue dots show possible camping sites for your raiding party to pull from. The map can be clicked on to show various screenshots of locations.</p>

      
         
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
        
      

      <h2>Preparing for Battle</h2>

      <p>In order to plan a successful raid of Northern Kael, one must have a proper force to attack. All players should be of level 50 or higher. How many groups and what types of classes you have available will decide how far you may go into the area.</p>

      <p>Northern Kael is broken up by two areas. One is the Arena and the other is the Temple of Rallos Zek. The Arena can be raided by three groups or more of lower 50s. The temple requires many more and / or much higher level players.</p>

      <h2>Anatomy of a Giant</h2>

      <p>The only main thing to remember with giants is that crowd control is very hard. Giants cannot be mezzed or stunned, so if you pull more than one, you will be fighting them all. A good plan is to have one of your groups work on fighting one while all the other groups attack the other. This way, it won't assist or heal and won't get behind your war party and start killing the wrong players. It is possible to charm the giants and get them to battle eachother, but this could turn into a suicide mission for the enchanter casting it. Also, there is a limit of what level mob an enchanter can charm.</p>

      <h2>Getting In</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>The fastest way to get your raid underway is to have everyone invis and head to the northern cavern before the Arena area. This can be done easily from the Wakening Lands zone and can prevent about a dozen kills that aren't really necessary. Once there you will have to pull the four giants, Guards (45) and Senior Guards (50+), in pairs from the archway that leads to the Arena area. There is one roamer in this cavern as well, generally a Senior Guard. Once these have been killed, two more Guards sit inside alcoves behind the walls. These can be pulled one at a time. Directly behind the archways are wanderers, so watch out for them as well. Be prepared to fight these two at a time. At this point, you are inside the Arena.</p>

      <h2>The Arena</h2>

      <p>There are two ways into the Arena area, the front and the back. The front will take you into the stands, where you will have to pull roughly six or seven mid level giants (about level 45 to 51). Since these are all in the stands, you are probably better off leaving these alone as they don't help you to pull the bigger mobs.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The back door can be reached by heading around the left side of the arena and up the ramp. On the way to the ramp you will encounter roughly four Guards. Once you head up the ramp, you will be at the northern courtyard of the Arena area. This large courtyard also has many static and roaming mobs including Guards, Senior Guards, Legionnaires and Adjudant, so be careful on your pulls and don't stay here too long or you will be fighting lower mobs all night.</p>

      <p>Here you can make a decision, either you are heading into the Arena or heading to the Temple of Zek. Only if you have two or three groups of heavy 55+ players should you try to go either into the back of the Arena or into the Temple area. The mobs there will simply destroy teams that are smaller.</p>

      <h2>Back Entrance to Arena, The Priests of Zek</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>Take your group to one of the two northern corners of the zone and pull the guards from around the Arena entrance. Make sure to avoid the five giants towards the north that guard the area leading to the Temple of Zek. Once these are pulled and killed, you have a difficult battle. Inside the door leading into the Arena are three Protectors of Zek. These mobs can be up to level 56 and will complete heal themselves or others. They are closely grouped so pulling them will be very difficult. More info on killing these three mobs is needed.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The Protectors of Zek are from level 56 to 58. They cannot be stunned or mezzed and hit for around 350 a shot. Two of them will quickly kill up to 12 people before getting debuffed enough to handle. With the amount of damage they deal, your clerics will have significant difficultly healing as much damage as your tanks are taking. Pulling these mobs individually is also a problem. Even an experienced monk will take so much damage so quickly, it might be impossible to break them up into single pulls. A three person team of feigners might be able to properly break them down, but more needs to be seen to properly figure out this strategy.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>To the left and right of that initial entrance are small rooms with three mobs inside. These mobs include one named cleric, either Semkak Prophet of Vallon or Gkrean Prophet of Tallon, and two Clerics or Priests of Zek. Here again, I am not sure of the best way to pull these mobs as they are very closely grouped and very powerful. Once pulled, a possible good camping spot would be in the corner of these rooms, far enough away from the spawning point to continue to pull the priests as they repop.</p>

      <p>Back in the hallway are ramps that lead down to the Arena floor. Inside these ramps are gladiators and named giants. Their level is unknown.</p>

      <h2>Cavern to Temple of Zek</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>If you choose to fight your way to the Temple of Zek, you must make sure to ignore and avoid the giants guarding the Arena. Pulling too many can end up taking all of your time and you will never be able to move. To the north of the Arena is a large archway with a transparent wall. Inside that archway are seven mobs. Two guards (Veterans or others around 56) face each other in two alcoves flanking the archway. Three mobs, one named (level 58) and two Protectors of Zek (level 56), guard the archway facing the Arena. The two guards in the alcoves can be pulled individually and the three others can be pulled in pairs if done correctly. You will have to fight one of the Protectors at the same time as the large named one, so be ready to hold off both mobs at the same time.</p>

      <p>To the left and right of the large ice wall are halls leading to the bridge area. Inside of these halls are two more guards, generally lower level.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The bridge has three wandering mobs, one of them is Derakor the Vindicator, a very tough level 65 giant and two level 58 Temple Guardians. They always travel in a tight group, so you cannot pull only one of them. Only if you have a very powerful raiding party should you attempt this battle.</p>

      <p>The temple itself has two level 60+ Guardians of Zek to the left and right of the entrance that can possibly be avoided if careful, but are easy to take out one at a time.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>There are two doors that lead into the temple. The only guards are in the main temple hall, so you can safely enter this hallway and set up your pulling camp within the hall. There is a single door to the north, in the middle of the U shaped hall that leads to the temple proper. Within the temple proper are two level 60+ Guardians of Zek on the left and right that might only be pulled in pairs and at the back of the hall is the Statue of Rallos Zek. The statue can be guarded by two level 58 Armors of Zek. It is rumored that the statue is protected by Zek himself, so be careful even if you do manage to defeat it, you might have surprise coming.</p>

      <p>That covers the basics of raiding this area of the city of Kael. Much of the information here is based on raiding experiences and from the spy mentioned earlier. It is not totally accurate, but is based on best guesses. Below is a list of external resources for information about mobs, maps and loot.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Loral's Guide to Iceshard Keep, Kael</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 5 January 2002</p>

  
<p class="summary">This guide was put together with the blood of two noble spies of the Tunarian court. Though of different skin and size, these noble warriors have hearts that sing true to the words of Tunare. Were it not for their sacrifice and the technology of the gnomish Ye' Quick Paintin' Box (patent pending) this information could not have been written. This guide will assist all who wish to attack Iceshard Keep within the city of Kael Drakkal.</p>

      
        
      
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
       

      <p>This map was drawn out by the Kael spies with markings for each giant that was seen. Clicking on the maps various locations will bring up an image of the location.</p>

      <h2>Introduction to Iceshard Keep</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>Iceshard Keep is a small area of the city of Kael that is separated from the rest of the city by an icy ledge. It is lair to many spell casting giants in their mid 40s to late 50s. It is an ideal raiding area for those who seek many quests including the 9th coldain ring quest, the 7th coldain prayer shawl and the Thurgadin quest armor as well as some nice dropped treasure. It is an ideal raiding area for two groups above level 50 or four groups from 45+.</p>

      <h2>Recon</h2>

      <p>It is highly recommended that you recruit a spy to get a full understanding of the area a few days before the raid begins. You can do this by building a level 1 fighter that worships Rallos Zek, running him to Kael Drakkal from the Iceclad Ocean zone and binding at the zone. This spy will not be killed by the giants and is able to freely roam the entire city except for King Tormax's lair and the northern temple of Zek.</p>

      <h2>Group Composition</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>Iceshard Keep can be raided with as few as six members, though they must be of levels 58+. An easier time would be had by two full groups of 50+ or four groups of 45+. Groups should be of the standard configuration including at least one healer, one tank and one evacer. In order to properly attack the Keep, the raid should have one enchanter to charm any adds, one monk or one level 60 character to pull properly from the keep without pulling too many mobs, one or more level 51+ shaman to slow the mobs down, and at least two fighters to fully off-tank any added giants. The rest of the raid should be a mix of damage dealers, healers and buff/debuffers.</p>

      <h2>Battling the Giants</h2>

      <p>The giants you will encounter during this attack range in levels from 35 to 51. Giants are fully immune to both stun and mez type spells, however they can be charmed and slowed. Many of the giants on the way to Iceshard Keep can be dispatched without much work when you have the groups mentioned above. Only at Iceshard Keep itself must you worry about your strategy for defeating these foes. For the larger giants, sentinels and above, one should make sure to slow and off-tank or charm each giant that is encountered. If the giants are slowed, they can be easily off-tanked by having a secondary tank gain the full agro of the giant and a healer keeps the tank alive until the rest of the force can focus on it. It is important to prepare your off-tank members beforehand so they know what to do when the time arises.</p>

      
        
      

      <p>The basic strategy for a battle with the giants should include the following arrangement. The puller will pull one or more giants to the raiding party. The primary tank gains agro for 15 to 20 seconds before the rest of the raid begins their attack, this is important for focusing all the healers upon one tank. During this period, a shaman or enchanter slows the giant down. Also during this period, any additional giants are either off-tanked or charmed. Once the first giant is down, any additional giants can be dispatched. Roots can also be used for controlling the number of giants one must battle at a time. All giants should be snared by the time they are halfway dead or the will run and gain additional support from other giants.</p>

      <p>The giants are on a 20 minute spawn time, so you will want to clear them and move quickly to your next hunting spot. With two groups, travel should be fast.</p>

      <h2>Beginning the Raid</h2>

      <p>The raiding party should start out at the Eastern Wastes zone border within Kael. Transportation should be provided to the Greater Divide or Iceclad teleport circle well before the event begins. Because of the low power of the eastern guards, the raiding party should be able to pull quickly through the first and second guard gates. The raiding party should move quickly, following the puller to the first two pull spots marked on the map in yellow. The giants encountered will consist of level 30 to 35 watchmen, senior watchmen and low level casters.</p>

      <p>The raiding party should move through the first two tunnels and guard gates and into the first major hall of eastern Kael. When entering the hall, there is a large icy staircase leading down and a small passage to the right that leads to the western halls of Kael. The stairwell leads to a semi-circle ramp that leads up to the icy ledge in front of Iceshard Keep. Below the icy ledge is a small pool and one or two giants. All the giants in this hall should be pulled and killed as your raid leads up to Iceshard Keep.</p>

      <h2>Pulling Outside Iceshard</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>The outside of Iceshard Keep is guarded by the first giants to give your 50+ raid any trouble. The Sentinals are levels 40 to 45 and are a bit more difficult than the watchmen defeated earlier. There are two guards above, near the keep's two doorways and two below. The two below can be ignored. Once the two guards by the doors have been slain, your puller should pull from the guard's dining hall by entering the right hand doorway. Once this room is clear the puller should pull from the foyer, clearing both entry halls into the Keep. Pulls from inside the keep will include giant spellcasters called Icecasters. Because of the giants immunity to stuns, no special strategy should be used to prevent them from casting, simply fight them as you would any other giant.</p>

      <p>Once both the guard's dining hall and the foyer have been cleared by the puller, you can move the raiding party inside Iceshard Keep through the left doorway.</p>

      <h2>Pulling Inside Iceshard</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>Once inside the keep, you can lead your raiding party into Reivaj's quarters through the north door of the foyer opposite the throne room. The entire raid should rush into Reivaj's quarters at the same time and fight him within there to remove any chance for adds from the throne room. Reivaj is a powerful member of the Iceshard family and is assisted by another giant Icecaster. Reivaj hits very hard and fast and must be slowed in order to effectively defeat him. His loot however makes it worth the time to defeat him.</p>

      <p>When defeated, the raiding party should move down to the staircase of the Throne room to the south.</p>

      <h2>The Throne Room</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>Vorkin and Klagan Iceshard stand at the southern most end of their throne room flanked by four of their sentinals and spellcasters. With a high enough puller (generally level 60), one can pull these guards one at a time, leaving the two powerful brothers for last.</p>

      <p>The two brothers have both powerful hand to hand combat skills as well as powerful spellcrafting abilities. They should be treated the same as the giants before, with slows to keep their melee under control and either charm or off-tanking to keep them from killing the raiding party spellcasters. Vorken is a cleric and will Complete Heal if he is able. He should be your first target before killing Klagan who is primarily melee.</p>

      <p>Once they have been killed, you can begin the true purpose of this event, uncovering the traitor of the Coldain.</p>

      <h2>The Quest of The Traitor</h2>

      <p>According to Dain Frostreaver IV there are six Coldain dwarves that have betrayed the noble dwarves and now work with the minions of Kael. One of these dwarves, Doldigun Steinwielder, seeks refuge with the Iceshard brothers. In order for him to show himself, you must stand on the throne once the Iceshard brothers have been defeated and say:</p>

      <p>"The Dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain."</p>

      <p>Attack the dwarf and a series of giants will spawn, starting with two level 51 giants. They should be properly off-tanked or charmed as they are very powerful and could easily cause problems for a small group. Once these two are defeated, a level 54 giant will spawn. Upon his death, a level 57 giant spawns and upon his death the final level 60 giant spawns. This giant has a huge amount of hitpoints and can take up to 10 minutes to kill with a full raid. Once the final giant is killed, Doldigun will spawn back up at the throne. He should be attacked and killed. He is level 54. Should he not be killed, he will despawn and you will not be able to restart the quest right away. It is important that your group is fully buffed and fully medded in order to take them all so quickly one after another. Spell casters should save their mana and ration it out accordingly for each battle and healers should use their most mana efficient heals to keep the tanks alive for each battle.</p>

      <p>Each of these giants has the ability to drop one of the Thurgadin plate quest armor drops, the true value and main purpose of this raid. They do not drop chain, leather or silk armor.</p>

      <p>This event should be triggered between each spawn of the four giants inside the room. Their 20 minute spawn will mean you can only trigger the event once every 20 minutes.</p>

      <h2>Other Mobs of Interest</h2>

      
        
      

      <p>There are a couple of other named mobs within Iceshard Keep that may be of interest to you or members of your raiding party. Because of the fast spawn time, however, it may be in your best interests to simply pick a single goal for your raid, such as the armor mentioned above, rather than trying to clear these named mobs every time they spawn. These mobs include Reijav who drops a nice sword and a ranged item with +6 strength, and Nojas who drops the Staff of the Icecrafter, a nice wisdom caster item. Once again, the armor is probably the most useful drop in this area, so keep your group focused on that.</p>

      <h2>Leaving the Raid</h2>

      <p>Once it is determined that your raid has met it's time limit, it is time to leave and leave quickly. Raids like these have a tendency to lose their organization once it is over, so make sure to keep control of the situation. the easiest thing to do is have each group port out to a specific location at the exact same time. Make sure everyone gets out quickly and at the same time or you risk having a single group fighting multiple giants. Your best bet is to pick a predetermined spot, and meet there before porting individuals elsewhere.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>This hidden building deep within Kael houses one of the most dangerous threats to the Coldain dwarves and all that they stand for. Organizing and leading a small two group raiding party can quickly clear out these foes and offer the possibility of some nice treasure for you and your groups. Hopefully this guide has given you enough information to plan such an event, but one should make sure to learn all you can before heading into this dangerous area. There is no guide like experience.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Spell Tips: Divine Aura</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 5 January 2002</p>

  
<p>No greater ability ever bestowed upon the clerics of Norrath is as powerful as Divine Aura. This is the only single spell given to a cleric that will stay in their spell slot for their entire career. Divine Aura will render the caster true invulnerability for eighteen seconds at a cost of 20 mana and with a one second casting time. Here are a few tips and tricks to using this very powerful spell.</p>

      <p>Feather Fall: While monks might be practitioners of the safe fall, clerics are truly the master. No matter how high you are, if you can cast this spell before you begin your fall, you will land taking no damage. Consider the mobs of the Aviak village in the penthouse. Should your party pull far more than it can handle, you can simply cast Divine Aura, jump off the side, drop the spell and gate before the mobs can reach you.</p>

      <p>Lose the Agro: While a few mobs will stay on and beat you while the Divine Aura is up, many will simply turn away and attack other members of your party. Should you accidentally blast a bit too much or just cast a word of healing that cured about 2500 points of health, you can use this spell to get the mobs off of you and back onto the fighters where they belong.</p>

      <p>Hotkey it: Here's a way to bind Divine Aura to a dedicated key of your choice. Make a social called aura. Inside the social type "cast 8". Make sure Divine Aura is always in slot 8 of your spell gems. Now drag the social over to your hot menu to a dedicated slot like the last slot on the right (slot 10). Finally, go into the keyboard configuration and set the user 10 command to a key you can reach easily from your basic movement keys. You can add a couple of emotes or group messages to this social as well, informing your party that you are currently under the protection of your diety.</p>

      <p>WARNING: Evac Buster! While Divine Aura may make you feel like a God for 15 seconds, it can sometimes create some horrible side effects. Divine will stop any effect that is cast on you including your own parties protection, healing or teleportation spells. If you really need a heal or an evac is coming, make sure to right click the spell off, so that you will go with the rest of them instead of being all alone with a stack of mobs on you. Remember, you are in control of the duration of the spell, you do not need to wait the whole 18 seconds to drop it, just right click the spell in your buff box and away it goes.</p>

      <p>Mana sink your opponent in a dual: One of my personal favorites is to dual another caster in the Arena. As soon as you start the fight, throw up the divine aura and watch the caster burn half his mana before realizing that you are unaffected. While they are burning it, go up and /rude them for an extra effect.</p>

      <p>Kite Trakanon: This one was a rumor I heard. The cleric leader of a large guild apparently uses Divine Aura to pull Trakanon, away from the initial teams that invade his lair. Even Traknons 1200 per tick poison breath and 550 triple attack has no effect when protected by this mighty spell. While Trakanon is busy hammering on the protected cleric, the rest can pull away his Sebilite Protector and make the future battle a little easier.</p>

      <p>So remember, keep this little gem of a spell memorized and it might not only save your life but impress your friends as well.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Cleric's Equipment Guide</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 5 January 2002</p>

  
<p class="summary">Recent Update:  This article was written before the coming of Focus Items.  These magical items help casters of all sorts improve their spells in many ways.  These effects have the largest impact on your performance of any pieces of equipment.  If you are levels 44 and below, many of them can be easily acquired.  There are a few focus equipment lists around but the following items can be purchased easily and contain very powerful effects.  Runed Mithral Bracers (reagent conservation 3), Mithral Runed Tunic (spell haste 2), Book of Obulous (improved healing 2), Black Alloy Medallion (mana conservation 2), Batfang Headband (Extended Duration 2), and Golden Bracers (Improved Range 2).  In short, Focus Items are the best way to improve your character through equipment.  End of Update.</p>

      <p>Though I have accepted my life as a vehicle for Tunare's love across Norrath, I have the merchants blood flowing through my veins. While the joy of helping Tunare's citizens out is my true love, I too am a sucker for the latest wares at the East Commons Tunnel Bazaar. This guide is designed to help clerics with their choices in equipment in Everquest. We first discuss some of the important issues surrounding equipment and then go into some details at different levels for items you might want.</p>

      <p>First let me start with the number one rule to loot in Everquest. Equipment really doesn't matter. I know you are asking how that can be true, so let me explain. Your Level matters far more than any equipment you can buy. Verant doesn't want any particular character to be picked over another because of the equipment they possess. While boosting your wisdom might get you more total mana, it will do nothing to your overall mana regeneration rate. How often do we start at full mana in a typical group? Nothing matters more to your character than your level. The spells you get, the abilities you gain and your power compared to the monsters you face is mainly based on level and hardly based on equipment at all.</p>

      <p>When thinking about spending time gaining a particular item, really ask yourself whether it is better to spend your time camping an item, or simply gaining experience. More often that not it will be the latter. Equipment simply comes and goes, but levels last forever (unless you die a lot =)</p>

      <p>We are all here to have fun and your equipment should be no different. Wear the items you like the best, whether it be something with a fun little proc (like the Holgresh Spirit Beads) or some truly wonderful stat boosting item (Herophant Cloak for those of you with too much money).</p>

      <p>So within this constraint. Knowing that really, equipment doesn't matter that much. How DOES it matter? The following are guidelines on determining what items are the ones to go after.</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>

      <p>Now that we have determined to use the equipment we liked best, we should know a little about what stats are important. After all, while one item will make little difference, a lot of items will. For clerics, certain statistics should be considered when looking at an item. They are in order from most important to least important:</p>

      
        Wisdom

        Every point of wisdom offers you more mana. At level 50, each point of wisdom gives you 10 extra points of mana. The lower your level, the less mana you will receive per point. Casters Realm has a good mana calculator for determining how much mana your wisdom will give you. Remember, this is your TOTAL mana, and not your regeneration rate, so having a very high wisdom will not make you that much better a character in a group situation where you are casting a lot. Also, points above 200 don't give you any more mana than below 200.

        Mana

        Think of every ten points of mana as another point of wisdom. Bonus mana can be a good way to get more mana once you have reached 200 wisdom. At lower levels, bonus mana can mean a lot more than wisdom, since mana is the same at any level while wisdom gives you less mana the lower your level.

        Armor Class

        Clerics do get attacked a lot, and it is very handy for us to be able to take a few hits before having to run behind our local tank. Make sure your armor class is good, and don't sacrifice it just for that little extra bit of wisdom.

        Saves

        While saves are more important at higher levels where raids against large mobs are more likely to occur, there are a lot of casting mobs out there and good saves can keep your resistances to their spells high.

        Strength / weight

        For clerics, strength only really effects your ability to carry items and money. Think of strength and weight as the same statistic. An item that weights 5 stones but offers +5 strength is the same as an item that weighs 0 stone. Also, weight reducing bags (like the Bag of the Sewn Evil Eye) are a wonderful way of increasing your carrying capacity.

        Agility, Dexterity, Stamina, Hit Points

        These do have an effect on your character, but not much of one. Agility helps protect you from attacks, dexterity will help you dodge and increase your weapon proc. Stamina and hit points will add to your total hit points. Don't pay too much attention to these, but if items also boost their stats, it can't hurt.
      

      <p>Remember though not to worry about these TOO much. If you sacrifice all your other stats just to reach 200 wisdom as fast as you can, you will have a hell of a time carrying all your loot as well as getting cut to ribbons by the first mob who hits you. You also might not be wearing the items that best define you as a character. Dare to be unique and roleplay!</p>

      <h2>Fun Factor</h2>

      <p>I am personally a big fan of items that fit my character from a roleplaying perspective. As a snobby cleric of Tunare, you wouldn't find me caught dead in a bloodstained tunic, but the golden armor might be a little harder to resist. I always look at items to see if it is something I would expect my character would use. I also like to pick items that help define clerics. If an item is cleric only, that is weighed higher than something that you would find on anyone. Balancing the items that define your character along with their statistics is a hard job, especially when the options are many. Just try to remember that the numbers aren't the most important thing.</p>

      <h2>Equipment Examples</h2>

      <p>The following is a short list of equipment for clerics that offer the best bang for the buck. They also represent some of the best items you can get for a cleric realistically.</p>

      
        Dwarven Ringmail Tunic (Ac 13, +8 sv fire, magic and cold)

        With the relatively high AC and the very nice save bonuses, this piece can make an excellent primary chest piece until you are able to get your initial class quest armor. Even then, you will want to keep it around for the occasional dragon raid.

        Adamantite Epolets (AC 9 Wis +7, 200p)

        This is another amazingly cheap item for the stats you get. I bought one of these at level 20ish and wear it even at level 54. Only some of the items in the Plane of Sky rival it and they are not even for sale.

        Platinum Ruby Veil (+7 Str, +7 Wis, 500p) and Platinum Jasper Rings (+6 wis, 250p)

        Now that the pricier and higher stat Velium jewelry is out, there is a significant price drop on the Platinum stuff. The stats are very high for the cost, and can really help fill out the stats that are important without sacrificing your look. This way you can wear armor that might not necessarily help out your wisdom.

        Charred Guardian Shield (AC 10, +9 wisdom, 500p)

        This is a truly excellent item. For about 500p you get 10AC and +9 wisdom for your secondary hand item. Instead of spending the eight hours camping Dyllin Starshine for the Testament of Vanear, go save up while earning some excellent experience and buy one of these. While it is 1 wis lower, the 10AC more than makes up for it.

        Golden Cleric Quest Armor

        The quest armor can be purchased or acquired from level 20 to level 40. While many complain that it does not boost wisdom as much as it should, it does a good job of offering you high AC and some nice general stat boosts. It also gives you the unique look of a cleric. Use jewelry and hand held items to boost your primary stats if you need, and use the quest armor for good looks and nice AC as well as secondary stat boosters.

        Donal's Armor of Mourning

        Donal's armor all has the wonderful ability to cast an effect when clicked on. Sometimes this effect is not too useful such as the bracer which casts Pacify or the Helm which casts Yaulp2, but other times it is a real mana saver. The Donal Gauntlets and Vambraces in particular will truly change the way you play your character as spells that used to drain your mana are now free. On a raid, you can now buff 30 folks with Armor of Faith and not have to med when done. Unfortunately, the chestplate and leggings are very difficult to get.
      

      <p>While I just brought up a couple of examples, there are some truly wonderful and relatively inexpensive items to be had out there. I started a thread on Best items per Plat on the Healers United bulletin board to discuss your favorite cheap items.</p>

      <p>Remember, the important thing is to have items you enjoy. As you progress through your levels, equipment will find a way to you, never get caught up in any particular item. Level means a lot more, but having fun means the most.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Loral's Guide to Everquest Usability</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 5 January 2002</p>

  
<p>The party members were packed five deep and five abreast in the narrow hallway of the Chardok royal keep. Just ahead a single noble monk began to draw out the lord of the manor, Overking Bathized Di'Zok. The raiding adventurers stood ready, waiting to see the powerful sorcerer come running around the corridor, then chaos. Three members from your group have their health drop down two red bubbles each. You mouse over to your group heal spell gem, fighting the lag of all the spellcasting with each inch. Just as you click it, you hear a shout to heal the main tank of another group. You press your arrow keys, trying to find him inside of the 5" box on the screen. When you see him and click, you target the big butted ogre next to him instead. Wait, now you have targeted him, but before you can mouse back up to your complete heal, he falls dead. Now two of your party are dead and the other three are dying quickly to the Overking's powerful spells. You try to click on your lead tank but the lag makes you feel like you are mousing through syrup, then everything stops. You didn't notice your own health falling like a stone the whole battle. Loading..please wait...</p>

      <p>Recently I was asked for tips and tricks to the life of a cleric in Norrath. My number one suggestion was to relook at your interface and find out how to make it easier and faster. Everquest is a very complicated game, and often we find ourselves struggling with the interface we are given even though Verant has made it very easy to customize. Spending the time to customize your Everquest environment will offer you the following advantages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Everquest will be easier for you to play and you will enjoy it more</li>

        <li>You will be a more powerful party member regardless of level or equipment</li>

        <li>You will have less physical and psychological stress while playing in rough situations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This guide gives you eight basic steps to improve your Everquest interface. If you follow them, you will be able to perform better with less work and enjoy more of the game's rich visuals instead of trying to click on that pesky spell gem. Print a copy of this guide and walk through it step by step while playing the game to learn how each of these features work.  Lets look at another battle situation.  </p>

      <p>Twenty eight adventurers stand ready as the powerful Guardian of Zek storms across the courtyard of Kael Drakkal. He hits the raiding party like the waves of Timorous Deep. The lead tank, a noble human warrior, holds the creature at bay but without warning, the Guardian begins crushing a shaman in your group. Hitting Shift+W switches you to that shaman, ALT+4 begins casting Divine Light, your fast and powerful heal spell. As the spell finishes you hear a shout that the lead cleric has run out of mana and that noble warrior is about to fall. Typing "/tar gen" puts Genalen on your target box, located right above your party's health. Making a quick decision to cast Complete Heal since he does have enough hit points to survive the 8 second casting, you press ALT+1 and the spell beings. As the spell casts, you right click, hold, and spin to check on the position of the rest of your members. Everyone looks in place. The heal lands and Genalen is saved. Hitting 5, the hotkey of your "/assist" hotbox lets you check on the mobs health. The day does not look good for the Guardian of Zek. Hitting 5 again targets a monk who has commanded the attention of the Guardian as he is falling. Though almost dead, the Guardian is making quick work of the lightly armored monk. Pressing alt+3 casts a quick heal on the monk, keeping him alive just as the ancient Guardian of Zek falls dead to the earth.</p>

      <p>Nothing is more frustrating than knowing what to do but being unable to do it. Using the out of the box interface for Everquest allows us to perform our duties as citizens of Norrath but not elegantly. While we are able to click on that pesky mob if it would just step out a bit, it would be far easier to simply be able to target him directly whatever his position. The following eight suggestions can drastically improve your ability to interact with the world of Norrath.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Use keyboard shortcuts and "/" commands instead of the mouse. Sure the mouse is a great invention, but many times, keyboard shortcuts are far faster to use than moving and clicking with a mouse. Everquest has a huge amount of keyboard commands at your disposal. Times typing "/bo 3" is faster than clicking on your spellbook and typing "/tar gen" is much faster than trying to click on that poor fighter who is about to die. Remember that keyboard commands can be abbreviated so you don't have to type out the entire command, just enough letters to separate it from the others. /gu for guildsay, /te for tell, /tar for target, and many others can help you cut quite a few keystrokes out of every day commands.  Learn the / keyboard commands.  All of the slash commands can be found in the eqmanual_supplement.doc file in your everquest directory.</li>

        <li>Use keys on the left side of your keyboard. By going to Options / Keyboard from the main view, you are able to customize what keys you use for just about every command. Move your movement keys to the W A S D keys to avoid having your left hand on the right side of the keyboard while mousing and moving. By using SHIFT and ALT keys you can set up just about all your main commands without using any key on the right side.</li>

        <li>Use the new Everquest Interface. Though it requires the Luclin expansion to work, the new Everquest user interface has many significant advantages over the traditional interface.  Features such as mouseovers, window resizing, tinting and moving, and much more flexability all add up to an excellent improvement over the original.  As much as you can, you should use the new UI.  You can do this by logging into Everquest normally and typing "/newui".  View Loral's Customized User Interface for my own personal modifications.</li>

        <li>Use Mouselook. With mouselook enabled, you can right click and look in all directions rather than just left to right with your movement keys. Pressing F12 will toggle mouselook on and off. You can rebind your left and right keys to MOVE you left in right rather than turn you. This allows you to "strafe" left and right without having to turn. This makes movement in Norrath far more flexable.</li>

        <li>Customize your font colors. You can modify your chat box to be much more useful than the defaults. Using the new user interface, you can bring up options with "ALT O", click the right most tab "Chat" and scroll down.  There you can change every color of every message type. Your text colors should range from most important to least important. I stayed generally along the basic colors, but for the darker colors I simply increased the current value to lighten the text.  Make sure to set the alpha for normal and faded to 100% in the chat window so you can easily read the text color all the time.  Remember that the most important messages should be the brightest and least important the darkest.</li>

        <li>Use Socials to launch multiple commands. Under the Menu / Social area you can customize a number of boxes to hold different sets of commands. For example, you can have one social do the following commands, each on it's own line:<br />
        <br />
        /sit off<br />
        /cast 1<br />
        /g casting Complete Heal on %T<br />
        /em unveils Tunare's undying love for %T<br />
        /do 4<br />
        /loc<br />
        <br />
        Line 1 has your character stand up if they are sitting. Line 2 begins casting the spell in your first box. Line 3 tells your group that you are casting complete heal on the person you have targeted. Line four has a little fun roleplaying emote. I am a big believer that stupid commands like this give a lot more flavor to your character and the game. Line 5 will invoke your fourth skill, in this case it is sense heading. This lets you gain skills while doing just about anything else. Adding this to all of your hotkeys will let your triggered skills grow much faster. Adding /loc to all of my hotkeys makes sure I will never have to yell "Has anyone seen my corpse!??" again.</li>

        <li>Put your most used commands into your Hotbox. The little ten slot box that sits on your screen is your hotbox. You can put up to ten different commands into your hotbox and have up to 10 different sets of hotboxes. Inventory items, skills, spells and socials can all be dropped into your hotbox. Right click on a spell, item, skill or social and hold it until the box floats with your mouse. Then mouse over the empty hotbox and click the mouse in the center of the box to drop your currently clicked item into that hotbox.  This gives you an easy way to put your ten most used commands, clickable items, spells, skills or socials all from one area and one set of keystrokes.  You may create up to ten pages of these ten boxes, giving you up to 100 possible hotboxes.</li>

        <li>Use Number keys to activate hotboxes, ALT+number keys to cast spells and keys for targeting group members.  By using keyboard presses instead of mouseclicks, you can vastly speed up and improve your overall Everquest skills.  By default, every hotbox is activated with the 1 through 0 keys and each spell can be cast by pressing ALT+ 1 through 8.  Set up easy to use keys for targeting group members such F1 though F5 or SHIFT Q W E R T.  This will help you quickly heal fellow group members.  Learn to use the keyboard instead of clicking on the buttons with the mouse.  This will greatly improve your game speed.</li>
        
      </ol>
      <p>You can create a very powerful combination of the above tips to make the game far easier to play.  Use a social to tie a group of commands togther, move this social to a hotbox and bind that hotbox to a highly used key. This alone will increase your efficiency during combat. Following all of the above will make you a more useful party member and increase your overall enjoyment of this great game.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Make Everquest Look Better</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">16 March 2003</p>

  
<p>Everquest is a beautiful game.  Every frame, every view gives us thousands of bits of information, from what armor someone is wearing to how many nasty fire beetles are outside the gates of Qeynos.  Our view into Norrath is the primary sensory output of EQ.  Everything else our computer has ends up leading to the picture.  We need to make that picture look as good as it possibly can get.</p>

<p>  This article describes ten ways to make Everquest look better and give you a better gaming experience.  The following settings will dramatically improve the look of the game, however it is mainly for newer systems with over 512 megs of ram and either Geforce2 or Radeon video cards.</p>

<h2>Set initial Options</h2>

<p>Who should do this:  Everyone.  Proper optional settings will make the game look better for everyone.</p>

<p>When clicking "Options" on the initial Everquest menu you will first be prompted to pick your video card.  Pick the one that matches your best video card, often the only selection.  The next menu is for detailed character models.  Choose as many as you can, ideally all of them on a system with 512 megs of ram or better.  The last menu is the Luclin Engine Settings menu.  Check "sound", "mip mapping", "Social Animations", "Dynamic Lighting" and "Texture Compression" to "on".  "Texture Caching" should be set to "off".  "Resolution" should be as high as you can go, 1280 by 1024 on 17" monitors and 1600x1200 on 19" and 21" monitors.  "Texture Quality" should be set to "high".</p>

<p>The detailed character models with Shadows of Luclin have greatly improved the realism of other players.  On a system with 512 megs of ram or higher you can set all models to the new ones including horses.  It is important that the use of high resolution models doesn't drop your frame rate to a crawl.  Frame rate is just as important as resolution for a realistic environment.</p>

<p>Properly setting these settings will dramatically improve the realism of Norrath from the detail of other players to the realism of the buildings and streets of the cities.</p>

<h2>Enable Mip Mapping</h2>

<p>Who should do this:  Everyone with a 32 bit color video card including Nvidia Geforce or Radeon video cards.</p>

<p>Mip Mapping is a way to blur textures as they get farther away.  Having this enabled will mean that objects appear smoother as they get farther away.  If this is not working, you will see things shimmer as they get farther away.  This breaks the solid feel of the game and reminds us that we're just looking at a stupid monitor, not a world.  Mip mapping helps create a solid world.</p>

<p>How to do this: The mip map setting under the initial "Options" set above is currently broken.  There is only one way to make sure mip mapping is working.  Open your "eqclient.ini" file in the everquest directory with Notepad.  Look for a line called "MipMapping=TRUE" and replace "TRUE" with "1" so the line reads "MipMapping=1" without the quotes.  Now restart Everquest.  Note:  Every time you change your display options you will have to redo this change in the eqclient.ini file.</p>

<h2>Set proper resolution, bit depth, and refresh rate settings</h2>

<p>Who should do this:  Everyone.  While settings will vary depending on system, everyone should tune resolution to its optimal level.</p>

<p>Every pixel is telling you something.  Every dot on the screen is a bit of information.  The more bits of information you have, the more information your brain can process.  The higher the resolution, the more realistic the game is.  Bump your resolution to the highest possible resolution you can with your current monitor and video card setting.  On 19" and 21" monitors with high end systems, you should be playing at 1600 by 1200 resolution.  On 17" monitors you should be playing at 1280 by 1024.  Try different settings out until you can find the highest one.</p>

<p>Like resolution, the higher the refresh rate the better.  Set a refresh rate at 75Hz or higher when possible.  This will make your screen refresh faster which will reduce the amount of flicker.  While 60 frames a second is very fast, 75 is much better.</p>

<p>Bit depth is one of the smallest changes that will drastically improve your picture.  Setting a bit depth of 32 bit will remove saw-tooths at the bottom of buildings and remove a lot of strange effects at the bottom of rocks or statues.</p>

<p>How to do this: There are two places to change this.  One is in the initial "Options" screen.  The other is in game with the Options menu.  Press "ALT-O" for options.  Press the "Display" tab.  Press "Video Modes".  Select the proper resolution for your monitor.  Select "75hz" refresh.  Select "32bit" bit depth.  Click "accept".  When your picture comes back, click "yes" to save those settings.  Should you pick a setting too high for your monitor, it will revert back to the original.</p>

<p>Icons and text will appear much smaller when you switch.  Use "/chatfontsize 5" to bump your chat text up.  The other windows will be smaller but you will get used to them in time.  Smaller user interface windows mean you get to see more of the world.  Remember that you are looking at a world, not a user interface.  Get the user interface out of the picture as much as possible.</p>

<h2>Clean your monitor</h2>

<p>Who should do this:  Everyone.</p>

<p>A little Windex can go a long way.  Removing smudges and dust can give you a much nicer picture.  Remember that your monitor is your window into another world.  Keep the window clean.</p>

<h2>Calibrate your monitor</h2>

<p>Who should do this:  Everyone.  Properly tuning a monitor costs no money and does not effect performance at all.</p>

<p>When a game artist designs textures they have their monitors set at something called "NTSC standard" a specific set of color, brightness, and contrast settings.  Your monitor should be calibrated as close as you can to NTSC standards.  Each monitor setting is different but you want your color to be set as close as possible to "normal". This tutorial can help you calibrate your monitor..  If you have a monitor with professional settings, the color temperature should be set to 6500K.  Proper monitor calibration will make colors appear richer, deeper, less washed out, and more vibrant.</p>

<h2>Set anti-aliasing level</h2>

<p>Who should do this:  Those systems running over 2ghz processors with over 512 megs of ram and either a Geforce 4 or Radeon 9700 video card.</p>

<p>Anti-aliasing is a feature of newer video cards but is often ignored.  With high-end systems, anti-aliasing can be set with little or no performance loss.  On most newer systems a level of 2x is appropriate.  With a very powerful system, 4x will improve it further.  Anti-aliasing will remove jagged lines  from objects up close and far away such as the edge of a sword or the brim of a helmet.  It gives a much sharper and more realistic picture.</p>
<p>How to do this:  Different video cards will do this differently but most follow this basic instruction.  From your windows desktop right click on the background and click "display".  In the tabbed window click "settings" and then the "advanced" box.  From this advanced window click the "Direct 3D" tab.  This window should have some form of "anti-alias" setting.  Try either "none" or "2x" for most systems.  Very powerful systems can try "4x".  Framerates will vary.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Why I Play Everquest</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">23 January 2004</p>

  
<p>Not everyone considers their time in Everquest well spent. Frustration, jealousy, and greed show up on almost every class message board. Class envy, content issues, and guild competition are debated with little statistical proof or credible evidence. Why are people so upset?</p>

<p>I quit playing Everquest at level 20 when I realized that as I grew, I would always still get killed by a variation of a rat, a bat, or a spider. Then two months later it dawned on me. The reason Everquest is different than other games is the 3000 other people playing it. They are the strength of the game. Items or levels or rat-like monsters do not matter, people do.</p>

<p>Around this time I came up with Loral's Rules for Everquest. Understanding them and following them let me enjoy the strength of the game and focus on what really matters.</p>

<h2>Rule 1: Enjoy Every Day You Play.</h2>

<p>If you aren't enjoying the game every day you play, change how you play. If every time you log on you feel an uncomfortable desire to experience grind or get depressed when you realize you have a raid, you are playing for the wrong reasons. I've seen many people quit because they do not like the "end game", an idiotic term for a massive online game, because they realize at level 65 what I realized at level 20. Equipment and lvl progression alone won't make the game enjoyable.</p>

<p>Find what you enjoy doing and do it. If you enjoy group hunting with friends most, go hunt. If you enjoy fishing at the lake in West Commonlands, go fish. If you're bored then go explore. Find a new cave and root out the evil that lives there, green mob or not. If you aren't enjoying the game now then levels and equipment won't help.</p>

<h2>Rule 2: The Grass Is Not Greener.</h2>

<p>Envy and greed are the two most destructive emotions in Everquest. They lead to the only real destruction that can happen in this game, the destruction of friendships. The game isn't much different at 65 than it is at level 20. A Blade of War at level 65 isn't better than the tarnished shortsword at level 2. Enjoy the level you are without sprinting to get to the next.</p>

<p>We all feel the instinct grow. We all want to progress. We all want higher levels, more AA points, and better equipment. Don't be a slave to these feelings. The shine of your blade never seems as bright as the shine of the other guy's. Your class never seems as powerful as those around you. These illusions are false.</p>

<h2>Rule 3: Gear, Experience, Levels, and AAs, aren't real. Friendships are.</h2>

<p>The only thing you take away from your time in Everquest are experiences and friendships. Your friends list is your most powerful item. The connection to four thousand other people is what sets Everquest aside from Final Fantasy.</p>

<p>There is no return on your Everquest investment other than friendships and fond memories. If you hate raiding or hate camping an item then don't do it. The item you receive will not last. In a few years it will be gone forever. That new shiny shield may seem like a great discovery but the friends who helped you get it are the real treasure. Never hurt a friendship over loot. Don't abuse your friendships for personal gain. You are destroying something real for something fake. You aren't gaining an item, you are losing something far more valuable. Treat everyone with respect and most will treat you the same.</p>

<h2>Rule 4: Items, Levels, Characters, and worlds will fall apart in ten years. What will you walk away with?</h2>

<p>In ten years how will you look back at your time playing Everquest? Do you consider it "wasted" because you don't have any of your fancy gear or even a record of your vast array of alternate abilities? What will your level or items mean to you then?</p>

<p>Only the fun times you had with your friends will matter when Everquest is no more. Keep contact with them and you may join them in another new game or get together for hamburgers and talk about the time you battled Trakanon. Those experiences and those friendships are the only thing that will last longer than the game.</p>

<h2>Rule 5: Roleplayers Have More Fun and Roleplaying is Contagious.</h2>

<p>Roleplaying is the breath of life in a game like Everquest. It is the seasoning to an otherwise bland meal. Without roleplaying, its just a bunch of statistics and polygons.</p>

<p>How does your character act? What is her background? Take examples from a movie or book, whether fantasy or not. Perhaps your fighter is the Lucca Brazzi of Everquest, lumbering and dangerous but without the best social etiquette. Perhaps your wizard is Elizabeth's Sir Walsingham, smart and strategic and always scheming. Perhaps your rogue is like Lara Croft, sexy and self confident as she dives into the ancient crypts with little concern. Give them a personality of their own. Give them faults. Make them real. Use emotes that speak for your character's emotions in any situation.</p>

<p>The more you roleplay, the more people roleplay around you. If you're into your character, they get into theirs. The more you roleplay the more you will enjoy the game.</p>

<p>Nothing puzzles me more than the constant negativity I read in Everquest editorials and message board postings. We pay for this game. If you hate the game then quit playing. Everquest is not an investment, its a game. All you can ever possibly hope to get out of it is entertainment, friendships, and experiences of great battles to remember. If you aren't having fun, then change the way you play until you are having fun. It is your money and your time, don't waste any of it doing anything you don't want to do.</p>
  



<h1>Mobhunter Articles</h1>


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The Beginning of Discord</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">12 February 2004</p>

  
<p>It is my great honor to introduce myself as one of the new writers for Mobhunter. It is a daunting task to continue the high quality of editorials that previous writers have brought to this site, but I will do my best.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the Gates of Discord opened and our world of Norrath changed. With this change comes a huge outpouring of news. Without any further wasted words, lets dig in.    </p>

<p>One of the most useful aspects of GoD, the Tribute Masters, have been removed for re-evaluation. It appears they are offering a bit too much power for the measly donations we've made. I was able to get 50,000 tribute points, enough to get the five tributes I wanted all upgraded to their max tier for fifty two hours straight. That was for only two normal-level LDON level 65 drops. I cannot say I am surprised, we did seem to gain a lot of favor for a little donation, but it would have been nice if this was balanced before it went live. I know, I know, A_Hoard_of_Cynics Shout "its never live! We're all beta testers!", but still.</p>

<p>The Tribute Masters are a great way for the casual adventurer to get a taste of some of the higher end effects usually reserved for the higher class adventurer who can either raid for or afford such mighty effects as Flowing Thought, Spell Haste, Healing Improvement, and Mana Preservation. For those who already have such effects, this is a great way to fill out the ones you do not. Hopefully they return soon and hopefully we don't see too stiff a reduction in points per item.</p>

<p>There is a big discussion on corpse recovery tools in GoD, something that seems to be lacking. While some painful pompous clerics (me) are making a lot of noise asking for more graveyards in old world zones as well as GoD, some still feel that a game without pain is no game at all. Challenge shouldn't be based on a two hour corpse recovery. Challenge should be based on the direct difficulty of an encounter. To say there is no challenge in Planes of Power or Lost Dungeons of Norrath is a lie.</p>

<p>There is already a new GoD map pack available for the Gates of Discord zones from our friends at EQ Toolbox. Though they are spoilers, these maps are especially useful for those hideous two hour corpse recoveries caused from a lack of graveyards (hint hint).</p>

<p>The difficulty level of GoD has been scaled very high. Mobs in the instanced dungeons are giving people a hard time, hitting for over 1k and attacking in packs. There are reports of a wandering Queen beast in the first hostile zone of the new expansion. Naked adventures run towards her with arms wide, embracing the thought of being struck down so violently by so mighty a beast like some strange Hale Bop cult.</p>

<p>The new city has everything a body needs. There are new trade vendors, a bank, and even someone selling invis potions for three plat each. This makes those painful two hour non-graveyard corpse recoveries a bit easier (hint hint). Unfortunately the only way to get to the city is by shuttle even though you can get to the rest of the world with a Wayfarer Magus port. I have a feeling the city will empty pretty quick when people find out it is still faster to do business in Plane of Knowledge and use the Wayfarers to transport to Natimbi.</p>

<p>Brenlo posted a new plan for an update in March. The second wave of melee balancing is supposed to be dropped in, as well as the graveyard zone. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on melee balancing. Clerics only became melees recently and my shoulder still aches like a son-of-a-gun from all that hammer swinging.</p>

<p>The graveyard zone is a wonderful idea. I know a few people who lost all their equipment due to family emergencies, medical problems, financial issues, and simple mistakes. There is no reason to lose equipment due to an inability to log in for a week and that threat will soon be removed. Unfortunately this won't help with the two hour corpse recoveries in the new Gates of Discord zones but I am sure that will be addressed soon.</p>

<p>Server stability has been a bit unreliable recently. Last night, just before zoning into a perfect LDON adventure, a decision made by those of us who had a nasty two hour corpse recovery the night before, we all crashed on zone and weren't able to get back until it had expired. None of us wanted to risk it crashing in the middle of an adventure so we all did something else instead. Hopefully these problems are taken care of soon (read tonight).</p>

<p>Our new world has only been open for a few days and already we feel that the Norrath has changed. We see strange zone names next to the folks on our friends list. We see links to items beyond even the absurdly powerful Plane of Time loot. We can almost hear the screams of fellow adventurers, themselves stuck in miserable two hour corpse recoveries due to a unreasonable lack of graveyards. Over the coming weeks we will discover more. We will dig in. We will uncover what these strange new armies of evil blind rangers and wither-legged clerics have in store for us. The wheel turns.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Play, Raid and Be Merry, For Tomorrow We Nerf</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">15 February 2004</p>

  
<p>A new server named after that new shady 'hero' of ours, Mordin Rasp, has gone live.  The reason for the new server was explained by over-population due to Gates of Discord.  I don't think technical limitations on players-per-server exist, at least not in numbers we like to think about, so we can only assume this is to spread out some of the higher-end guilds who may be butting heads for higher-end content.  Considering Gates of Discord has a lot of new high-end content to spread out the existing uberguilds anyway, those numbers must be quite large.</p>

<p>While one could argue about the results of a consolidation of servers, the prophets of doom will have to put away their "Everquest is Dying" sandwich boards for at least a while.  Dying games don't bring up new servers for overpopulation problems.</p>

<p>Rod Humble was kind enough to stop by our previous article and explain that server stability was due to the casino.  The casino was shut down, supposedly for some bureaucratic Shadow Haven alcohol and hem-line ordinance, but server stability has continued to be an issue all weekend.  People are going linkdead upon zoning and are often stuck at the server select screen because of login-server flooding.  Again, we can assume that the amount of returning players are creating a larger load, but hopefully we will see this fixed soon.  It doesn't do well to have such instability so soon after a large expansion release.</p>

<p>I tried the casino before it was boarded up and lost two hundred plat in perhaps four seconds.  I decided my days as a high roller were over and went back to hugging trees for a living.</p>

<p>Tribute modifications are another big topic.  Here's the text from Friday's patch message:</p>


The Tribute system as it was released has caused a greater variance in favor distribution than was intended.  In order to make the system more healthy, fair, and balanced, there will be changes made over two updates -- one today and one next week.

<p>The following changes have been made today:</p>

<p>- Favor Maximum:  There will be a maximum limit of 200,000 favor that a player character can have available at any time.  If a player has accumulated more than 200,000 favor at the time of this change, the character will retain its favor, but will not be able to add to it until it falls below 200,000.</p>

<p>- Favor Value Adjustments to Items:  Some items have had their favor value adjusted to be more appropriate.  For this update, this will not affect the favor amount that a player has gained by handing in items that have had their favor values adjusted.</p>

<p>For next week's update, we will be adjusting each character's favor amounts based on any items that were handed in to Tribute Masters that have had their favor values adjusted.</p>

<p>We hope you continue to enjoy the benefits of the Tribute system and Gates of Discord.  </p>

<p>In other words:  Play, raid and be merry, for tomorrow we nerf.<br />
</p>

<p>Before the change I had turned in two LDON items for 45,000 points total.  When I checked today, a third LDON item was still receiving 17,000 points.  A newly dropped LDON item, however, only gave me 1000 points.  Though far lower, I can understand why most items were given new values.</p>

<p>200,000 tribute points can give you four focus effects and Flowing Thought for about two hundred hours.  If tribute points were too easy to get, everyone would have them all of the time.  The increased costs let people get the effects they want but at a high cost.  Too low and it simply increases everyone's power for no loss and no work and devalues static items with those same effects.  Why buy a Healing Improvement item when you can get the tribute for next to nothing?</p>

<p>There should high, perhaps painful, cost for tributes.  You should have to feed the dragon to gain his powers and now the dragon is hungry.</p>

<p>Illia of Allakhazam's has added tribute points to Lucy.  You can look up the current tribute points on items such as the Greatstaff of Thunder, Planar Lance of Torment, and Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic (which doesn't appear to be nerfed yet).</p>

<p>People are upset about these changes and they have a right to be.  We would have hoped that tribute values were stable on release.  Nerfs are always far more vexing than increases in low-powered problems.</p>

<p>An unannounced option to show spell effects for only you and your beastly target was added recently.  Pressing ALT O and clicking "display" shows you the new spell effect options.  If you haven't tried the new spell effects yet, do so.  They are beautiful.</p>

<p>It is too early to report on the content of Gates of Discord.  Server wide channels are buzzing with links to some powerful items and we hear reports of many zones and many of the mobs in them without much to base fact against fiction.  We will watch to see what content the high-end guilds gain as well as the casual single-group adventurers. In the coming weeks we will see how it plays out.  Keep reading.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Chaos Reigns Within</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">18 February 2004</p>

  
<p>There was a patch this morning to address a few issues.  Here's the patch message and a commentary:</p>

<p>Update 2/18/04</p>

<p>Tribute System</p>

<p>------------------------</p>

<p>- You may see a change to your accrued favor points as we implement the second change to the Tribute System.  As you know, many items were overvalued and have since been reduced.  Now we will be adjusting the accrued favor pool to reflect the amount you should have received for items turned in prior to the changes.  We know that this may take away some of your accrued points and for that we apologize, however this change will bring the system more in-line with our intentions.  We hope that you agree that it was a reasonable and necessary change.</p>

<p>Well, thats not likely.  Deep down we all know this is a good change.  Anyone who thought about how the system would have worked as it was will realize that there needed to be a change.  One could turn in three items of low to moderate value and have enough points to gain some major effects or stat bonuses.  Items with such effects can cost a fortune in DKP, LDON adventure points, or plat.  The modified system still lets people get these effects but at a higher tribute cost.</p>

<p>Even if it is for the best people are bound to be upset for a few days.  I'll still be using the tribute system but I won't be running around with Vengeance X all the time like I was before.</p>

<p>Server Stability</p>

<p>------------------------</p>

<p>- We have made some coding changes to the front end to improve connectivity and stability and reduce the number of 1017 errors.</p>

<p>The EQ team apologizes for the server instability in the past week. This instability occurs at peak times, and is seen to our users as "1017" errors.  Normally within a few minutes these users are able to log back in, but on some servers this problem has occurred more than once in a single evening. </p>

<p>We're working to address the problem, and expect that in the next couple of days we'll have everything resolved. In the meantime, there's a chance you'll run into this problem if you're on a crowded server during peak times - if you do, you can normally get back onto the servers within 15 or 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Gates of Discord has been immensely popular - many of our old customers have been coming back to try it out, and many new customers have arrived to give EQ a try.  Our simultaneous usage numbers are quite high, but in addition the people who are online are also playing more and for longer than usual.  Gates of Discord introduced many new instanced zones, high level content, and re-introduced the casino - this type of content is particularly taxing on our servers, and coupled with the unusually high usage, we're seeing a resulting instability during our peak times.</p>

<p>Our first effort was to remove the casino, which improved our server stability.  Since then, we've been working on two different fixes, the first of which will go live at the 3am patch Wednesday morning (Tuesday night).  The second will be later this week.  Both of them are meant to improve performance during peak times and address the 1017 errors that you may be experiencing.  Each of them we expect to be an improvement on connectivity, and we expect our second fix to resolve the problems.</p>

<p>We apologize for our service instability in the past week; we're working hard on this problem - it's cutting into our play time too.  :)  </p>

<p>We'll give you another update in the next day or two as we make progress, and let you know how things are coming.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Rod Humble for giving Mobhunter a deeper view into problem and how it was going to be fixed.  These server issues cut into a lot of people's play time.  Last night I went on my first Gates of Discord raid, some pair of priests and their pet golems in Barindu, only to hit a 1017 after a wipe out.  Corpse recovery is difficult enough in Gates, but to hit 1017 right after dying hurts even worse.  Sure enough, ten to fifteen minutes later I got on, got my shinies, and helped res my fallen comrades.</p>

<p>The following items had their "Cleave" effect removed due to stacking issues:</p>

<p>    * Bracer of the Heartstriker<br />
    * Bracer of Exploration<br />
    * Bracer of the Stoutheart<br />
    * Vadd's Chestplate of Elite Combat<br />
    * Rayin's Chestplate of Abhorrence<br />
    * Pressl's Tunic of Balance<br />
    * Kizash's Tunic of Savage Heart<br />
    * Luvwen's Chestplate of Melody<br />
    * Nadien's Chainmail of the Archer<br />
    * Nodnol's Chainmail of the Scoundrel<br />
    * Harlad's Chainmail of Fury<br />
    * Trimdet's Chestplate of Chivalry<br />
    * Gem-Studded Band of Struggle<br />
    * Glowing Spiritstone Necklace</p>

<p>I don't know what Cleave is and I'm not familiar with the above items so I can't say how big a deal this is.  Post a message if you have any views on it.</p>

<p>Over the past week people have found a lot of good information on the new lands.  We are beginning to see it take shape.  Once we discover more and find any potential bottlenecks that prevent large groups of players from getting to new content we will discuss it here, but for now most are still figuring everything out.</p>

<p>When Planes of Power came out there were a few problems.  There were only four hunting zones, Disease, Innovation, Justice, and Nightmare.  Soon people who hit level 65 had no place to gain significant experience.  They were stuck waiting in line for pick up groups at the Executioner trial to get to Valor and Storm for some decent experience gains.  </p>

<p>The smaller window of experience giving mobs made it all but impossible to gain levels in the old world zones and drastically reduced the level ranges of groups.  This was a disaster.  Many players joined larger guilds not because they wanted to raid all of the time, but because it was the only way for them to get to zones in which they could hunt with any good gain.</p>

<p>A few months later, when the first big guilds started getting into Plane of Time, they made some substantial changes that fixed these problems.  Six new zones were opened - Valor, Storm, Torment, Bastion of Thunder, Crypt of Decay, and Halls of Honor.  Level 50 mobs started to become profitable for a level 65 hunter.  A level 65 could group with a level 50 and get experience.  Old world zones became profitable again. Shortly after this, Lost Dungeons was released and single groups received even more content.</p>

<p>There does not appear to be any wall in Gates of Discord like there was in Planes of Power.  The instanced content is difficult to get to and there is no built-in method to deal with painful corpse recoveries, but there is new huntable content for high level single groups.  Flagging events seem to have both instanced group and raid paths, although they sound quite difficult.  I've heard rumors of lower difficulty instanced encounters but I haven't been able to try them and I'm still scared to death of Barindu.  There looks to be a lot of new content for the Elemental and Time level guilds, but we still have to see how much content there is for the lower Planes / Lost Dungeon equipped hunting groups.</p>

<p>Keep reading and we will dig into this subject more in the future.  For now, pack some extra rations, tighten the straps on your worn boots, keep your cloak and hood tight, and start making a lot of necromancer and cleric friends.  We're off to Taelosia!</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Who is Loral, Anyway?</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">24 February 2004</p>

  
<p>This week I thought I would speak a little bit about me and discuss some of what has been found in our first non-1017 weekend of the Gates of Discord.</p>

<p>Loral Ciriclight is a 65th level Cleric of Tunare living on the Quellious server (;tell Quellious.Loral hi!).  I've been playing Everquest since early 1999 and started Loral in May of that year.  I have been there for the opening of every expansion to date.</p>

<p>I am not in a raiding guild.  My guild, Healers United, is designed to help all of Norrath's adventurers.  Our average prime-time numbers are around twenty with about half of those above level 60.</p>

<p>Though not in a raiding guild, I have gone on many raids.  I have fought every major god in the Planes of Power except for the last two tiers in Time.  Thanks to some good friends, I am flagged up through and including Plane of Time.  I am well equipped for a non-raiding guild cleric mainly due to good luck.</p>

<p>I have written elsewhere about why I play Everquest so I won't bore you with that here.</p>

<p>My favorite expansion is the Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  Lost Dungeons shows a great level of flexibility.  It offers adventures for anyone level 20 or above.  Anyone can work towards some very respectable loot.  There is a lot of adventure, excellent looking mobs, great challenges, good treasure, and nice new features.</p>

<p>Call me a fanboi or a VAK - wouldn't it be SOEAK now? That doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it - but I love this game.  I wouldn't have put 7200 hours into it if I wasn't having fun.  I wouldn't want to write for Mobhunter if I didn't care about EQ.  Some decisions by SOE I agree with even if they seem to hurt on the surface (tributes) and some I don't agree with at all (the location of level 65 spell drops in PoP).  Regardless, I enjoy each day I log on and I've met some really great people over the past four years.  If that makes me a fanboi, so be it.  I've heard worse.</p>

<p>Now that I've introduced myself, lets dig into the news.</p>

<p>This weekend was the first weekend when people could explore the new lands of Taelosia without hitting 1017 errors on zoning.  Tells were fluid again.  Few went linkdead.  We could begin looking at the content of the new expansion instead of worrying about staying connected.  A new patch is still planned for sometime this week but I haven't heard anyone complain on Quellious of being stuck since last Thursday.</p>

<p>People are still upset about lost tribute points.  Most agree that the change was necessary but reports of people losing a lot of gear they wouldn't normally have turned in are still coming in.  In a few weeks most of us will have forgotten about it. The Tribute nerf will become another story to add to Donal's Breastplate (I am still bitter even though I never had one), mass group buff, and the moss covered twig.</p>

<p>There are some unconfirmed reports that Lost Dungeon cash amounts has dropped a lot.  One would think with the new money sinks of Tribute points and the casino that they wouldn't have to cut the cash out of LDON but it appears to be a lot lower than it was before GoD.  I've done a few adventures recently and my own cash split came out with barely enough to cover my peridot costs.</p>

<p>Some Gates of Discord strategy guides and discussions have begun to show up on various message boards.  Some were even stolen by the evil empire of Yantis / My Super Sales causing an interesting scandal.</p>

<p>The content of Gates seems to focus on players at level 65 with very good gear and a lot of AA points.  The first four hunting zones seem to be the only ones geared for people below level 65.  I tried one of the instanced trials last Saturday.  My group included moderately well equipped hunters, all of us with a lot of AAs and gear including Ornate, LDON high end gear, and Planar gear below elementals.  I was killed by a diseased gnat that hit me for 1200 a hit on our second pull, something my guild has yet to let me forget.  We survived the adventure but it was very hard.  Lesser adventurers would have been destroyed.  The mobs didn't have much more than 15,000 hitpoints but they hit for 1200 and some were unslowable.</p>

<p>Gates of Discord is a expansion for raiders.  A lot of raiding content can help spread out the guilds who have been sharing Time and the Elements for the last six months.  While flagging events can be done with a single group, there are few single groups powerful enough to complete it if they aren't from a raiding guild originally.</p>

<p>I was surprised and disappointed that a LDON-style adventure system isn't in Gates of Discord.  The adventure point system seems like a perfect in-game DKP system for single groups.  You can earn your points and buy what you want without worrying about luck, camping a rare spawn for three days, or feeling like you've taken it from someone else.  It is a great system and I hope we see more of it soon.  I would love another LDON style expansion.</p>

<p>Our world is vast and over-population isn't a problem anymore.  There are hundreds and hundreds of non-instanced zones for all levels and an infinite number of instanced ones.  Gates of Discord adds content for a large group that had reached the end of their own path and it has at least a few hunting zones for the rest of us.  Just watch out for the gnats.</p>

<p>I'll leave you with a couple of fun hotkeys those wacky clerics came up with:</p>

<p>To automatically port near a wayfarer:<br />
/target magus<br />
/say East Commonlands</p>

<p>To automatically loot normal mobbos:<br />
/target a<br />
/loot</p>

<p>To automatically fish and bag the results:<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/doability 4 (where 4 is your fishing skill number)</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The Tao of Moorgard</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 1 March 2004</p>

  
<p>There is an interview about the new graphic engine with Robert Pfister, Everquest producer.  The engine is due out this spring.  One big question is how many people will be stuck without a Direct X 9 card.  Even if it is 1% thats about 4000 players [thanks for the math checks]. </p>

<p> The other questions are a lot more fun to dream about.  Will we see new character models?  Will the frame rates for raids get better?  Will my uber-Everquest machine run even better now?  Can Everquest be played on cheaper and cheaper hardware?  There's little information on a lot of these questions but there are some good answers and implications in the interview.</p>

<p>For the Everquest sandwich board "The End is Nigh!" crowd, it would appear they have multiple expansions in the works or they wouldn't bother upgrading the engine.  We can expect increased graphic features (fogs, lighting, shadows, better animations) in future expansions due to this upgrade.  SOE is working to make Everquest not only the most content-rich <br />
but also one of the better looking MMORPGs on the market.  We'll see how it compares to other MMORPGs but right now there isn't much to compare it to.</p>

<p>I noticed that our old friend Moorgard has a weblog on his adventures surrounding Everquest 2.  Here's Moogard's adventures in China and here's Moorgard's first blog entry if you happened to miss it.  His first entry is an interesting look at his daily life.  His second covers a trip to China to spread EQ2's evil propaganda in a country built on evil propaganda.  Here's a couple of interesting quotes:</p>

"Knowing that thousands of people are going to be dissecting the minutest aspect of everything I say, I want to make sure my [Lies] are worded in the most correct manner possible."

"While there were some amazingly elaborate booths set up to show off various games, our purpose was not to put on a huge public demo [read: All of our glossy pictures of scantily clad women got confiscated as weapons of terror at the airport ]."

<p>This amazing EQ2 screenshot shows how realistic the environment is, but the models could use some work.</p>

<p>Moorgard failed to do the two things all bloggers must always do: apologize for not posting sooner and swear to keep writing more in the future.</p>

<p>People are still hammering away at the content of Gates of Discord.  We're starting to see some three-week reviews popping up here and there.  Most angst seems to come from the expansion's high difficulty and low experience reward.  I have a friend who was earning 6% of an AA per kill in a full group in Fire fighting mobs that were about half as difficult as the blue mobs in the sewer trials.</p>

<p>People are already referring to the various trials as "timesinks".  Timesinks seem to be anything you don't like doing.  The whole game can be a timesink.  If you like doing something, it's entertaining.  If you don't like doing something, it's a time sink.  Of course, if you don't like doing something, why do it?  Who am I to say.  I got torn apart by vampires in a hard LDON adventure last night so I'm a ways from passing those 1200 damage gnat trials.</p>

<p>Aside from the login server croaking on Saturday morning, the servers have been up and stable, so we have the priviledge to be torn to shreds by tiny insects.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Death of the Fisher King</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">10 March 2004</p>

  
<p>Patch day today!  Here is the full contents of the patch.  </p>

<p>People seem to be confused about the actual change to today's melee changes.  Almost all of the changes mentioned in the patch apparently already existed.  I don't remember seeing the 5% damage mitigation for warriors before but the rest of it doesn't appear to be new.  Here were the changes mentioned:</p>

<p>- Discipline timers were revamped, allowing greater freedom and frequency of use.<br />
- Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee abilities and disciplines.<br />
- Warriors received an innate 5 percent increase in their ability to absorb damage.<br />
- Warriors received the Incite line of abilities, giving them a new tool for aggro management.<br />
- Monks received the Phantom Call line of abilities, giving them a new tool for pulling.<br />
- Several new disciplines were introduced for all three classes.</p>

<p>Items were given more statistics on their inspection screen.  Many worn items now show what their actual statistical values are for attack, mana regeneration, damage shields, and hit point regeneration.  Everquest lacks a lot of viewable statistics.  We have piles of meaningless numbers like AC, attack, and damage and no numbers at all for mana.  Everquest could improve the game for the statistic junkies by showing more of the calculations for damage, armor, mana, and spells.  They should show what the actual minimum and maximum damage a character can do with their current weapons, equipment, and statistics.  They should show a numeric value for mana.  It won't damage the game and it won't be doing anything a thousand other RPGs have done since 1970.  </p>

<p>Items with innate spell effects that also had level requirements will now scale down the effect as well as the item's statistics.  If you had Flowing Thought 3 boots with a recommended level of 50 on your level 10 wizard, you won't be seeing FT3 anymore.  Its a nerf, but not one that we shouldn't understand.  If an item wasn't meant for a level 10, then it shouldn't work for them.</p>

<p>It appears that Cleave was added back to the items that lost it before.  I love the name of that effect.  Some other weapons had some minor changes and only the Hammer of Striking appears to be a nerf anyone is talking about.</p>

<p>Some epic drops were increased.  It is good to see that they are keeping an eye on the problems with old-world content like epics.  If they would fix the Plane of Sky by allowing Call of the Hero it would be a great help for a lot of people who still need their epics.</p>

<p>Tradeskill combines were fixed today.  The selling costs of Gates of Discord fish got nerfed.  Most everyone seems to think it was either acceptable or inevitable but people are still angry.</p>

<p>Gates of Discord spells now drop a bit more often but we don't know where or how much yet.  There are a lot of level 65 people who can use these spells but aren't powerful enough to go deep into Gates of Discord due to a lack of equipment or AAs.  This is also a problem with Planes of Power.  Ancient spells are a good way of giving the more powerful hunters of Gates a reward for their work, but they shouldn't be the only ones to see any of the Gates 65 spells.  65 spell drops in both Gates and Planes of Power should be increased.  I'd even like to see one or two be vendor purchasable.</p>

<p>Some heal spells were modified and it seems to have upset shaman and druids.  Clerical spells got a bit of an increase to their overall power while the shaman heal over time got a higher mana cost and no increase.  All of this talk of the new Holy Trinity (warriors, clerics, and enchanters if you believe the propaganda) has everyone on edge.  The 5% damage mitigation of warriors and the healing increase for clerics (on spells most of us cannot get yet) won't help the matter.</p>

<p>A single LDON style adventure camp in GoD would have gone a long way towards quieting some angry voices.  The adventure point system was the best thing to happen to equipment progression and it is a shame we don't see it at all in Gates of Discord.  Adding some new higher point items to the existing LDON adventure camps would be a big improvement.</p>

<p>Tribute items were messed with again.  I don't know what the results were yet, but I still had an item worth 20k points that probably isn't any longer.  This isn't a big surprise, more like aftershocks after a big earth quake.</p>

<p>Dire Charm was modified but I haven't heard any enchanters scream about it.  It seems to be more of an all-or-nothing ability now.</p>

<p>There were a bunch of smaller changes as well that I haven't discussed.  If any of them are big deals that I've missed, feel free to comment about them.</p>

<p>There are some good things on the horizons including the new graphics engine and the graveyard zone.  </p>

<p>The engine was released on test for compatibility testing but we won't know how much of an actual effect it will have on performance for a little while.  Frame rate increases are a great way to make the game look better overall.  While visual effects are easy to spot, a good frame rate is what makes a 3D game like Everquest look really good.  The higher the frame rate, the better everything looks and feels.</p>

<p>I am hoping they make the graveyard zone a bit more useful than it sounds so far.  While the current description of the zone will prevent people from losing equipment after a full week corpse rot, Everquest could use a better corpse recovery method overall.  One common complaint of Gates is that corpse recovery can be very difficult.  There have been a few good options mentioned on various class forums to improve corpse recovery in EQ.  Hopefully the developers pick up on this and make the graveyard zone a little more useful.</p>

<p>This hasn't been the most exciting patch ever but I still can't help but get excited when I log on after changes like this.  We will get more information as people play around a bit</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Drizzt Joins the Wayfarer Brotherhood</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">16 March 2004</p>

  
<p>R.A. Salvatore will be writing a series of novels based on Everquest.  Here's the press release.  Salvatore is the author of the very popular Dark Elf books which has now reached a total of sixteen novels.  About half of the PC names in Everquest are different spellings of "Drizzt" so even if you haven't read his stuff you've already know his work.</p>

<p>Lore is a very important part of the game for me.  There is a lot of story that can be gathered from various quests and some outdated information from the beta.  Often there are holes and half the fun is filling in those holes with our own lore.  Don't like how the Wayfarer's run things?  Perhaps they're a fascist organization spreading propaganda and using the players as their own army of thugs and assassins.  Can't figure out why the vampires of Mistmoore aren't attacking Felwithe?  Perhaps they are too busy in-fighting to care about the mortals up above.  Marvel comics used to have a thing called the no-prize for people who fixed continuity mistakes in their comics.  Its fun to do that with EQ as well.  It's easy to find a plot hole but it's harder to come up with an explanation of the plot hole yourself.</p>

<p>Salvatore has spoken well of Everquest in the past.  He is an Everquest player and even made the mistake of giving his name out during an online chat with SOE and the players.  I sent him a tell once but he was AFK in the bazaar.  I think Sony built him a special kiosk up there.</p>

<p>Salvatore has the opportunity to fill out the world of Norrath beyond anything we've had so far.  A lot of Everquest lore comes from woefully outdated bits and pieces from pre-beta days.  Expansion lore, in-game stories, and quest dialog fills out the rest.  There is a lot of room to fill, however, and some of us have a great time filling it in with our own ideas.  Lore is a very important part of the game for me and I am looking forward to these novels.  It will be nice to carry a bit of Everquest with me when I can't log in.</p>

<p>[Update:  One would have hoped that I had actually carefully read the press release.  Salvatore isn't writing the books himself but editing books written by a selected group of fantasy writers.  Its still good news, but we won't be seeing Salvatore's writing himself, at least not for all of it.  Published Everquest fiction from any author is still very exciting and I am still looking forward to it.  Sorry for the error.  - Loral]</p>

<p>This week is the fifth anniversary of Everquest.  Keep an eye out for scavenger hunts, battles against beasts of ages long past, big firework displays and possible armies attacking our fair cities.</p>

<p>I haven't seen a lot of in-game events happening recently.  The dynamic nature of Everquest leaves a lot more room for events like this so I hope we will see some fun ones this week and I hope we see more of them in the future.</p>

<p>The official Everquest 2 website has gone through an update including a large expansion of the official Everquest 2 forums.  Our old friend Moorgard is running the show over there so be nice.  It was on that forum that I first learned about Salvatore's new books.</p>

<p>There was a small patch today.  The casino returns for the third time so lets all keep our fingers crossed.  There is a new newspaper at the town Crier.  I don't know how many people read it but it is very relaxing to buy up a newspaper and sit on the shores of Felwithe's river reading of the Antonican Bards news.</p>

<p>There were some positive changes to the Shaman heal over time spells with some fifty point per tic hit point increases on spells.  I can't say if this will appease Shaman or not but its a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>See you at the fireworks display!</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: A Fistful of Froglok Tongues</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">24 March 2004</p>

  
<p>There was a patch on Tuesday that was a lot more significant than it appeared.  </p>

<p>The new graphics engine is at least partially released.  I was sitting on the docks of Nedaria when I saw the new sunrise.  I was shocked at how much better the new sky made the rest of the game look.  Performance on my moderately high-end machine was much improved although the frame rate still dropped when a lot of people were in view.</p>

<p>The new patch caused a lot of problems as well.  Strange geometry bugs caused chaos for movement and combat strategy.  Many systems were seeing strange graphical bugs.  Some systems couldn't log on at all.  No doubt these bugs are being worked on and I bet we see another patch soon.  Such bugs are to be expected and the long-term benefits of an engine that can grow in the future make it a necessity.  A lot of folks did have a frustrating night, though.</p>

<p>SOE released a new zone on Stormhammer called the Lost Pyramid of Galuuk Korr.  The zone has something to do with Takish Hiz and the patch message described it as an "adventure" zone but gave few details.  My hope is that it's a whole new adventure camp complete with Wayfarers, adventure merchants with new loot lists, and a set of new instanced zones.  Some say its just another zone added to the Takish Hiz set, which is probably more likely, although less exciting.  The zone will be released to the general community in the next couple of months.</p>

<p>You've no doubt seen packs of people running through old world zones and slamming through the poor beasts who have no doubt enjoyed their times of peace.  Hundreds of thousands of gnolls, gargoyles, undead frogloks, wisps, sharks, goblins (both fire and water), kerrans, spectres, and skunks fell to the mighty blades and spells of adventurers seeking the famed Staff of Endless Adventure.  The staff's effect is different depending on the length of time you have played.  I missed the best staff, the Nagafen's Tail, by two months.</p>

<p>Returning to the old lands for this quest was great fun and full of nostalgia.  Lower level folks have a harder time with it, but if they can find a big brother or sister to help them, it can be done in less than an  hour.  </p>

<p>New Fabled items have been dropping from more powerful Fabled versions of big mobs from the days of old.  The Fabled Journeyman's Boots have brought up a lot of controversy.  The original version of these boots let anyone cast a full SoW on anyone else.  SOE cut them back to a slower self-target only SoW as of Tuesday's patch.  Recommended levels were also added to a lot of the Fabled items.</p>

<p>Visiting old-world zones and seeing crowds of people shouting "ASS SUP CAMPED!!" brings back fond memories.  I hope SOE continues to bring some life into a lot of zones that people have been ignoring for a long time.  There are some great dungeons like the Gorge of King Xorbb that are ignored for easier and more profitable places to hunt.  Throwing a few more powerful beasts and some updated loot helps breathe more life into these zones.</p>

<p>SOE posted some interviews with Everquest developers past, present, and future.  While its interesting to meet the faces behind the world we spend so much time in, there isn't a whole lot of new information about the game.  I heard the term "secret project" mentioned more than once but that could be a new "grab the Halfling" flash game for all I know.</p>

<p>Gamespot released some interesting statistics about Everquest verified by the folks at SOE.  The claim that 3000 items have not been discovered had people scratching their heads.  This reminded me of Fippy's Facts but there hasn't been an update in a while.  I suppose a lot of statistics could be misinterpreted or misused to support any jackass agenda - including my own. As Mark Twain said, "There are three kinds of lies: Lies, damnable lies, and statistics".</p>

<p>SOE's Future Plan is focusing on the new Graveyard zone.  No one should ever lose the items they've spent thousands of hours working on, and this zone will ensure that doesn't happen.  </p>

<p>This zone can be far more useful than planned, however. Planes of Power and Lost Dungeons of Norrath focused the challenge of the game on the encounters themselves instead of the challenge of running naked across Western Wastes with four Velium Hounds looking at you like a steak with legs.  There are a few ways to make the graveyard zone more useful than currently described.  Here's one option.</p>

<p>Introduce an NPC who will summon your body to the graveyard zone 30 minutes after your death for a cost that scales for both low and high level characters.  The cost should be high enough that it doesn't cut into the Necromancer's role as a corpse summoner.  It would still associate a cost for death but doesn't make life so difficult for mid-level hunters who made the horrible mistake of wanting to see Dalnir's Crypt.</p>

<p>Of course, as a good Everquest citizen, I sent SOE this feedback.</p>

<p>It's another exciting time to wander the lands of Norrath.  The new sky and the recent anniversary changes have brought a lot of life back to areas that had been stale for some time.  Time to hunt down Fabled Fippy.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Pretty in Pink</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">31 March 2004</p>

  
<p>Sony Online Entertainment opened dozens of new forums on the Everquest Live site.  They created forums for all classes, servers, and a new Veterans lounge to offset the wildly off topic Newbie Lounge.  Brenlo, the Everquest community relations manager, posts often on these new forums. SOE has added a handy dev tracker to help us track what's being said by the official folk.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that SOE replaced the forums is to combat the purchase of community forums by Internet Gaming Entertainment.  IGE is a company who sells in-game equipment, characters, and plat for real world money, a direct violation of the Everquest end user license agreement.</p>

<p>I could write a few thousand words on this topic but most cool heads recognize that the developers didn't design Everquest with the purchase of in-game products for real world money in mind.  Selling Everquest commodities for real money ties the virtual economy of Everquest to our real-life economy.  Factors in real life economy, such as cheap off-shore labor, effect in-game economy by lowering the value of plat and thus raising the cost of items significantly.</p>

<p>By creating class forums within the SOE website, Sony offers a discussion area that is not supported by a company that helps users violate their license agreement.</p>

<p>While these official forums help battle the hideous tyranny of IGE, they may harm solid and honorable community forums such as Graffe's and the Safehouse.  Forums such as Graffe's and the Safehouse offer a lot of support to the Everquest community. They offer excellent discussions and details of the game moderated by an outside party.</p>

<p>Creating an army of new forums opens SOE up to Big Brother conspiracy theories but they have shown their objectivity and speak often on difficult topics.</p>

<p>How this will conclude isn't clear but in the mean time we have some fast forums that are ad-free and use your normal Everquest login.</p>

<p>On the Future Plans page, in a message that appeared and then shortly disappeared, SOE hinted at more Lost Dungeon of Norrath adventure zones:</p>


Yearning for adventure?  Can't get enough LDON goodness?  Then rejoice, as we plan to add more adventure zones to the Legends server, Stormhammer!  Go to EQlive.station.sony.com for details on the Legends service.


<p>I went to the EQLive website - as I do every day - and didn't see any more information about it.  The spies reporting back from Stormhammer say that the new LDON zone released last week restricts players below level 50.  By creating zones that dynamically populate themselves with creatures from level 20 to level 65 SOE created one of the greatest innovations in Everquest history.  Gates of Discord includes no such zones and this LDON freebie zone doesn't seem to follow the same model as other LDON zones.  I hope that the adventure zones mentioned above will offer the wide level range of original LDON zones.  This fellow posted some excellent ideas for new adventure types.</p>

<p>SOE released a patch this week along with the required prime time post-patch patch.  Here's the message:</p>


We have improved collision checking.
System perfomance should be improved.

<p>Rogue Combat Abilities<br />
---------------------------<br />
We have made the following changes to the rogue Sneak Attack line:<br />
 <br />
Sneak Attack will now make your next backstab attempt always hit and do extra damage.  You may only use a Sneak Attack ability after being hidden for a few seconds.  Once you become visible, you must attack quickly or the advantage will be lost.<br />
 <br />
This change affects the following abilities:<br />
 <br />
    Sneak Attack<br />
    Thief's Vengeance<br />
    Assassin's Strike<br />
    Kyv Strike<br />
    Ancient: Chaos Strike <br />
</p>

<p>Patching during prime-time hours upsets a lot of folks. Some nights it is nice to get a break and know that I'm not missing anything.  In perhaps the worst nerf in history, Sony released and then a few hours later destroyed our glorious pink-bordered spell icons.  Sony fixed some other strange bugs that had creatures getting stuck in trees or falling through the earth in the later patch.</p>

<p>Rogues received the biggest change in this patch.  SOE gave rogues what some have described as a laughably worthless skill that guaranteed critical hits with ranged weapons, a skill most rogues care little for.  SOE replaced this with a skill that gives them an automatic hit on backstabs under certain conditions.  Rogues gave the new skills mixed reviews.</p>

<p>The latest Fan Faire starts Thursday.  It has some excellent panels including a panel on Everquest fiction hosted by R.A. Salvatore.  I dream of panels like this.  I am a huge fan of his books and have written Everquest fan fiction for the last four years.  Unfortunately I live on the east coast and will not be able to attend.  If you are attending the Fan Faire, please take excellent notes and post as much information as you can.</p>

<p>So ends this weeks update.  I expect some excellent information to come out of the Fan Faire for next week.  Keep an eye on early April for the new graveyard zone and give those new forums a try.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The Lost Dungeons of Vegas</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 7 April 2004</p>

  
<p>Lets start with the pain.  A lot of folks had problems with the login servers this week starting on Sunday and ending yesterday.  Sony stated that it was a problem on their end, not the net in general, but gave few details.  Problems like this get everyone riled up.  It gives us a frightening view of the type of game where we spend so much of our time.  We don't lose our single player games like Neverwinter Nights, Final Fantasy X, or Knights of the Old Republic don't die when servers go down, but we also don't play them for 2400 hours.  It would appear Brenlo and his band of orcs has beaten the gnomes back into submission, however, and last night I heard little of login and stability issues.</p>

<p>I missed this year's Fan Faire and every picture I've seen or message I've read has driven a barbed stake into my chest.  Many reports have said this the best Fan Faire yet.  I've read a few good reports but most of them sounded like this: "I got so drunk but I think I remember Phister saying that pointy hats were coming real soon now.  Then I woke up with no wallet."</p>

<p>Lots of players embraced the new message boards.  Brenlo began the painful task of asking classes for feedback starting with monks.</p>

<p>We talked about Salvatore writing Everquest fiction a few weeks ago and then qualified it by saying he would edit, not write, but the Safehouse has reported that he will write at least one of them.  We'll have to see how it turns out.  Salvatore has written about his time in Everquest often on his message forum and stated that its a game in dire need of some solid history.  Even if Salvatore only edits them, his name will help push the books out and we might get more insight into the corruption of the Wayfarers.</p>

<p>Last week the EQLive Future Plans update included statements about new Lost Dungeon zones.  We do not know any of the details but three questions come to mind.  Will the new LDON zones include new items on the adventure merchants?  Will the new zones scale for levels 20 to 65 like the other LDON zones?  Will this include a new Wayfarer camp?  The Lost Dungeon zone that appeared on Stormhammer didn't seem to offer much.  The zone would allow those around level 50 to enter.  I have seen no new information about adventure point rewards, mission types, or loot.</p>

<p>High level players stated their concern that the Gates of Discord trials require warriors and clerics for three of the six members in order to succeed.  Brenlo posted a note saying that their developers are working on a way to scale the encounter based on party composition.  A lot of the issues surrounding class balance, levels, equipment, and alternate advance skills can be fixed by scaling encounters based on the groups composition, equipment, levels, and skills.  </p>

<p>Right now encounters all come down to how much damage you dish out and how much damage you can take.  Trying to balance so many classes against two variables is difficult to impossible.  By incorporating new encounter types, encounters that scale based on the classes, levels, skills, and equipment of the party, they can balance classes with encounters instead of just increasing damage output or damage avoidance.  It always bothered me that spellcasting mobs fight the same as melee mobs except they complete heal or gate when they get close to death.  Wizard mobs should be powerful and dangerous, not just melee mobs that cast resisting nukes once in a while.</p>

<p>The Graveyard zone went live in an unannounced patch along with this patch message:</p>


April 7, 2004

<p>[T]he Graveyard zone, Shadowrest, is now live!</p>

<p>We have introduced the new graveyard zone, Shadowrest, to the live servers.  The zone will allow adventurers whose corpses have decayed, after 7 days, to retrieve it.  They will merely have to greet the appropriate NPC in one of the following zones to activate their transport to Shadowrest;</p>

<p>East Commonlands<br />
The Plane of Knowledge<br />
Toxxulia Forest<br />
Qeynos Hills<br />
The Feerrott<br />
Butcherblock Mountains<br />
The Field of Bone<br />

<p>If you do not have an expired corpse, you will not be able to travel to Shadowrest.  If you have multiple expired corpses, you will need to make multiple visits to the zone.  We hope you enjoy this new addition to EverQuest!</p>

<p>The EverQuest Team<br />
</p>

<p>No longer do level 46 hunters of the Plane of Fear have to worry that all of their gear will rot because they made the mistake of walking into that firey doorway.  No longer will the level 15 paladin who fell to the bottom of Blackburrow worry about his lost minotaur axe.  Items should never rot completely and now they won't.  This is a great addition to the game.</p>

<p>Seven of the eight articles on the Fan Faire news site are about Everquest 2.  I won't discuss Everquest 2 except where it relates to Everquest 1.  Everquest 2's method of corpse recovery brings up an interesting question.  When you die in Everquest 2, you return with all of your gear.  This seems like an easy improvement to Everquest that wouldn't make death inconsequential but would help make this game a lot more accessible.  Most people just don't have a free two hours to fetch a body.  Right now, corpse recovery isn't optional, its required.  Everquest should give the player the option of spending some time getting resurrected or losing a fair amount of experience.</p>

<p>Sony has three massive online games with a new one coming soon.  Everquest, Everquest 2, Everquest Online Adventures, and Star Wars Galaxies.  In three of these four you return with your gear after death.  If all of these new games restore gear on death, why not change Everquest in the same way?</p>

<p>Graphics are the other big draw of Everquest 2.  We don't know how it looks without seeing it in action, but those that did say it looks good.  It is interesting, however, to compare the features of Everquest 2's new graphics engine with those of the new Everquest engine.  Both offer better lighting, bone-based animation (some strange necromatic magic, I suspect), bump mapping (good for Trolls I assume), and other advanced graphical features.  I don't doubt that Everquest 2 looks better than Everquest, but if future expansions use these new features and we see model upgrades in Everquest, how will it compare to Everquest 2?  How does Sony plan to handle two games competing for our time and money?  Many people can afford to pay for both games every month, but not a lot of us can afford the time to play both games.  I quit playing Everquest Online Adventures not because it wasn't good but because I always felt the REAL Everquest calling me.</p>

<p>We will not see the answers to these questions for a few months.  I have no doubt that Sony plans to continue to support Everquest as long as customers pay enough to offset Sony's costs.  For now, I'm more worried about passing that last painful mountain pass trial, Yaffa or Ikea or whatever its called.</p>

<p>Sony has a few few big changes planned and I'm looking forward to them.  We're hearing rumors of a model update.  Sony mentioned the release of two new expansions in the next 18 months.  The graphic update is getting more stable by the day and a lot of people are seeing performance improving.  The new Lost Dungeon zones are exciting even if most of our questions aren't yet answered.  Now if only Xuzl would quit whispering "Watch American Idol" into my ear.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Trial and Error</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">14 April 2004</p>

  
<p>SOE released a patch today with a few small but useful additions.  Players can now cycle through PCs and NPCs with a single key.  We will have to see how this works in practice but it sounds great.  Everquest Online Adventures included this feature and it worked well there.</p>

<p>The patch included changes to see-invis mobs in two Gates of Discord zones that caused problems for people on corpse recovery.  I've already talked enough about corpse recovery for a while, but I do want to talk about another frustrating aspect of Gates of Discord.</p>

<p>Friday night I traveled to the far reaches of Barindu and put up my "looking for group" sign in the hopes of getting into the Vxed trial.  About 10pm that night I found a group willing to fight their way to the end.  We killed our seventy fifth beast by about 1am and began our last twenty five kills on the way to the NPC who would give us our flag.  By 2am we reached the room before him and got stuck.  There were too many mobs and we couldn't break them up.  Time ticked away and eventually we tried a pull.  It went badly.  With the strength of divine aura and the rest of my party slain, I managed to get the flag although the rest of the group did not.  Four hours had been spent working to that point and the trial offered no recovery.  Sorry.  You lose.  Try again when you have another four hours.</p>

<p>Gates of Discord Expeditions require too much time.  Instead of having several hour and a half encounters that a group can work on with limited time, players need to have four free hours to get through the trial.  The time duration is so long that many players knowingly violate the Everquest End User License Agreement, give their password to another player, and have the other player get them through a flag.    </p>

<p>In my Friday night Vxed expedition I didn't log off until 4am.  I spent six hours working on a single trial and although my divine aura helped me get my flag, five other players did not.  I have no problem with the difficulty of the expedition.  I have a problem with the time required.</p>

<p>Splitting a single expedition up into four 90 minute expeditions fixes this problem.  Instead of passing six four hour trials, one can pass eighteen 90 minute ones.  This requires the same time to succeed but not all in one sitting.  It allows players with limited time a chance to progress through Gates.  Now players with limited time are faced with a choice of handing out their account info or not progressing through Gates.</p>

<p>When I sat down to write this editorial I asked myself what I hoped to accomplish.  I don't expect that the trials will be modified as I described, but I do hope that SOE builds future expansions and content around durations of under two hours.  The two-hour time focus of Lost Dungeons adventures permits people with limited time to progress through content (and equipment) in small pieces.  Future expansions should follow this model.  Gone are the days where we must camp Ragefire in Solusek B for four straight days.</p>

<p>Like my argument about corpse recovery, the challenge should be in the encounter not in its duration.  If I defeat twenty five beasts in Vxed, I can probably defeat seventy five more.  Encounters tuned to 90 minute durations increase the accessibility of Everquest to a larger player-base.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Found: More Lost Dungeons</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">28 April 2004</p>

  
<p>Sony released a new patch today with a few interesting new features.</p>

<p>Sony released new adventure zones on Stormhammer and on the regular servers.  The zones sound interesting except for their restrictive level limitation.  The rest of Lost Dungeons included zones scaled for levels 20 to 65 so I don't understand why these zones were not scaled the same way.  The zones are not restricted by time limits or adventure goals but also do not offer adventure point rewards.  Besides being instanced, they don't sound very different from normal zones.  I only wish the level limits were less severe.</p>

<p>This patch included the first release of "Hot Spots".  Certain zones offer experience rewards for a limited time in order to get adventurers of various levels to travel around a bit more.  Like the Fabled mobs for the anniversary, this offers a reward for those who take the time and energy to explore these hot zones.  Like the new adventure zones, none of these apply to level 65 players, but the 65 level folks did just get Gates of Discord.</p>

<p>All players now have access to the Plane of Knowledge.  The Plane helped all of Everquest become a lot more accessible to new players and this is a good improvement.  I am surprised Sony doesn't bundle Kunark and Velious into the core game and give these two aged expansions to everyone.  Sony could then release expansions with these two previous expansions in mind.  I'd love to see a Lost Dungeon expansion released in Kunark and Velious.</p>

<p>Oh yes, we received one nerf today.  The named mobs in the GoD sewer and mountain trials no longer spawn on creation, they spawn later in the hunt.  This prevented named farming by respawning the dungeon over and over.  I can see why they did it but a nerf is a nerf.</p>

<p>The Fabled mobs and their gleaming new treasure no longer spawn.  The new beasts and their gleaming treasure breathed some life back into old zones and hopefully the new hot spots will do the same.  Under-population of old-world zones worries a lot of people.  Many new players never hunt in places like Runnyeye, Paw, the Gorge of King Xorbb and Dalnirs.  Of course, I blame this on a lack of reliable corpse recovery, but I blame my lower back pain on the lack of reliable corpse recovery.  The real reason of under-population is a higher risk for a lower reward than populated zones.  Fabled mobs fixed this for a short period of time and only in very select camps at very select zones.</p>

<p>Sony begins accepting beta test applications for Everquest 2 in May.  The beta itself begins in June.  With those dates, it seems likely that Everquest 2 will be released on schedule at the end of the year.  It wouldn't surprise me if we see an announcement for a new expansion around the same time.  No one knows how Everquest 2 will affect Everquest.  SOE will want to show their continued support for Everquest, support I expect to see continue as long as it is profitable to do so.  Some see Everquest 2 as the doom of Everquest.  Many said the same thing about Dark Age of Camelot, Final Fantasy XI, Star Wars Galaxies, and others.  While the release of Everquest 2 has more impact than those will, I do not see much changing for at least another year.  As long as Everquest is a fun and fresh world to live in, we will want to live there.</p>

<p>It would not surprise me to hear about a new expansion soon.  With the unknown fears of Everquest 2 making many nervous, Sony will want to quell any thoughts that Everquest 1 is doomed.  I'm hoping for a "Lost Dungeons of Norrath Part II" with dungeons in Najena, The Gorge of King Xorbb, Old Paineel, and a giant's lair in Raithe Mountains.</p>

<p>The debate on tank status in Gates of Discord rages on.  Some don't seem to understand that this only affects about four discovered zones.  Only on certain Gates of Discord expeditions does warrior tanking appear to be required.  These trials are required for progression but so was the Plane of Justice and many people were stuck there for weeks.  </p>

<p>Paladins and Shadowknights tank hard adventures in Lost Dungeons and hunting groups in the elemental planes all of the time.  The problem isn't that paladins and shadowknights aren't good tanks, it is a problem with the difficulty of a specific and small set of content.</p>

<p>Loral's rant of the week: Where in Hate are my 65 GoD spells?  I love the Lost Dungeon loot system and while I'd love to see something like that in Gates and every future expansion, I'd especially like to see it for spells.  A wayfarer merchant offering up spells to those who have completed X number of Sewer and Mountain trials would give more people a chance at those spells without reducing the difficulty in acquiring them.</p>

<p>The Adventure Merchant system reduced the randomness of loot distribution without making it too easy to get them.  It is the same as the dragon kill point systems that most uberguilds use today.  It shouldn't replace dropping loot, but it could easily augment it.</p>

<p>So ends the rant and so ends this week's update.</p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The End May Be Nigh Someday!</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 5 May 2004</p>

  
<p>Sony began accepting applications for beta-testing Everquest 2.  It's no surprise to hear that thousands of people submitted applications.  Would-be beta-testers hammered the application servers resulting in some typical page request errors, duplicate applications, and a host of other problems.  In order to sign up for the beta, one must apply from the computer one plans to play on.  This prevents people from applying on most work machines.</p>

<p>Moorgard and Faarwolf have been keeping people well informed on the process and procedures of beta signups.</p>

<p>Sony released a small patch today.  The changes included one's ability to change his or her surname, hitpoint regeneration improvements, and /rewind.</p>

<p>The ability to change one's surname comes as a small surprise.  GMs will cease to be flooded with requests to change surnames.  It is now easier to annul the many failed in-game marriages we often hear about.  It's a small change but I see no disadvantage.</p>

<p>Hitpoint regeneration now improves the longer you sit.  This regeneration allows players a chance to solo and recover a bit easier.  Wizards, Druids, and a few other classes have an easier time soloing than rogues, warriors, and other melee classes.  This regeneration gives other classes at least a chance at soloing successfully.  The problem shows up when we consider grouping.</p>

<p>Grouping builds relationships.  Grouping teaches people new skills.  Grouping helps people learn more about the game than they would find out on their own.  Grouping helps people find guilds. Grouping builds social skills, both in-game and in real life.  To throw that away for soloing is to remove the whole reason to play Everquest.</p>

<p>Everquest offers many advantages for grouping.  Grouping is necessary for Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  Grouping offers a large experience bonus over soloing.  Most of the game's content below level 65 is tuned for single group hunts.  The single group is the most common unit of gameplay in Everquest.</p>

<p>These hitpoint regeneration changes are good, however.  This change helps individuals and groups without healers alike.  I don't expect it to harm the game at all.</p>

<p>Our Neriak spies returned with reports that Sony is retuning Gates of Discord.  Tuning changes include experience boosts, tuning of Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi, NPC max damage mitigation so clerics can tank (relax, I'm kidding, I meant knights), increased spell drops, easier zone travel, NPC innates (I have no idea what this is), and the inclusion of some non-agro animal mobs. All of these changes look excellent and I applaud Sony's attention to these problems.</p>

<p>Afterlife, one of the top guilds across all servers, quit on Wednesday.  Their post was the first negative posting I can recall seeing on their website.  They felt strongly enough to break two metaphors in one sentence.  I had always enjoyed Afterlife's objective and clean updates and its a shame to not only see them leave but to see them leave with such a poisoned tongue.  At least they didn't post a count-down.</p>

<p>I'd be surprised if every member of Afterlife cancels their subscriptions and stops paying.  I imagine the guild may disband; I imagine many of them will go to another game; I'd even expect some to return.  It would surprise me if every member felt as strongly as the post stated.</p>

<p>Obviously if that many people have been having no fun since The Rathe (an encounter they defeated a year ago), I have to question why it would take so long for them to quit.  It sounds like we all need a reading of the divine article Why I Play Everquest by one of the most highly respected writers of Everquest news, lore, and editorials.  Remember the golden rule:</p>

<p>Have Fun Every Day You Play.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Whispers of War</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">10 May 2004</p>

  
<p>Content has many forms.  New levels, gear, encounters, abilities, and zones excite us.  It's the one thing that separates Norrath from AOL Instant Messenger.  It is the context of our existence in Norrath.  New features, zone revamps, even small UI patches are a form of new content to explore.  Last week revealed quite a lot of upcoming content.  Please spear me before I say the word content again.</p>

<p>The Omens of War whisper past us in the bars and inns of Norrath's cities.  It appears the Wayfarer Brotherhood has bitten off a little more than it can chew.  The wars of Mata Muram begin in two months.</p>

<p>SOE revealed few details about Omens of War but what they have revealed created quite a stir.  New epics, new levels, a task system, a guild tribute system, new titles, and new graphics are all listed on the Omens of War website.  There were a couple of other bits of discovered information including zone names that sound a lot like Lost Dungeon zone names (West Battlegrounds A, B, C, D) and notice that epic 2.0s are separate quests from original epics.  One won't have to turn in or even acquire the original epics before acquiring the new epics.  Even the Everquest board moderators don't seem to know much about this new expansion.</p>

<p>I hope to see a short-duration task system available to all levels.  Why should the level 20s be the only ones to deliver propaganda between the Wayfarer camps?  I'm already collecting zombie skin and vampire teeth for them, a demeaning job for a high priest of Tunare if I do say so myself, so why not make me the Norrathian equivalent of FedEx?  Maybe I can get some special shorts!</p>

<p>Nothing is yet known about the zones, the encounters, or the rewards.  I dream of another adventure point system.  I loved the Wayfarer cookie idea posted by Pverex on last week's article.  I dream of zones that scale for levels 20 to 70.  I dream of Lost Dungeon style adventures with expedition style control.  I dream of a smooth experience curve above 65 so I can still hunt with my level 50 friends.  </p>

<p>The release date of Omens of War appears to be the end of July.  Rod Humble stated on my well received previous Mobhunter article that the beta for Omens will be wider than Gates of Discord was. I look forward to the release of new details.</p>

<p>The next big bit of news is the revamp of Gates of Discord.  A lot of folks aren't happy with Gates for a variety of reasons.  The expansion appeared tailor made for Elemental / Time guilds but strange, difficult, and buggy encounters and a lack of good loot disappointed a lot of them.  Everyone who faced it felt that the beasts of Taelosia hit a bit too hard.  I still cannot walk ten feet through a town without someone reminding me of the 1200 point-hitting gnat that turned me into holy dungeon pizza.  Lower level players found little reason to purchase Gates.  Only one zone is huntable below 50, tributes became too expensive for their usefulness, and new tradeskills were often incomplete.</p>

<p>Details of the revamp are still hazy and only when we try Gates after the revamp will we know how good the changes were.  The proposed changes include zone retuning, experience modification, easing travel, lowering output damage, increasing spell drops (again), increasing cash drops, and a reduction in required flags for Ikkinz (wherever that is).  These sound good but even Brenlo's second explanation left out a little detail.  Exactly what were the intended level ranges of the five open zones?  What will the tuning of these zones entail?  We'll know Wednesday, I assume.</p>

<p>In the mean time, begin preparing for war.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Caves of the Kobold Slavers</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">27 May 2004</p>

  
<p>It's been a while since we've had an update but this one has a couple of neat things in it.  Today's patch included a new tutorial, possible fixes to the Plane of Knowledge crashes, some UI updates, and a couple of more tidbits.</p>

<p>Last week I started up a level 1 Berserker on the test server to try out the new tutorial and I was very impressed.  It's a mixture of local and server-based quests and a new generic low-level zone.  It walks new players through Everquest's complex interface as well as it can.  It makes great use of the "Find PC" yellow magic trail to lead a new character from NPC to NPC.  As a veteran player, I cannot give a truly objective analysis but it appears it will do a good job of teaching new players the basics of our game.  The rewards for walking through the tutorial include enough experience to reach level 3 and a powerful charm.</p>

<p>Proper marketing and improvements to simplify Everquest's interface bring new players online.  The more players in Everquest, the better the content and service we'll see.</p>

<p>Which leads us to Sony's new pricing plan.  For $120, a customer receives a one year subscription to Everquest and all seven current expansions.  This is an excellent deal but few new players are willing to make a $120 commitment on a game they haven't played yet.  This pricing plan works very well for players with multiple accounts.  There will soon be a package called "Everquest: Platinum" (how's that for false IGE style advertisement?) containing all expansions up through Gates of Discord for $30.  A $10 version called Everquest: Chronicals (Everquest: Copper?) is said to contain the old world, Kunark, Luclin, and Ykesha.  The strange set of expansions is due to their inclusion of new races.  My Neriak spies tell me future low-priced expansions will include mid-level and high-level content to go along with this beginner's set.</p>

<p>The biggest problem we've seen recently are the Plane of Knowledge crashes.  The developers posted many updates to the problems but crashing in the most popular zone in EQ builds a lot of frustration within Sony's paying customers.  We can hope this patch helps the problem; if not, Sony can expect quite a few more posts on the tech forums.</p>

<p>Sony released little news on Omens of War but some changes to the Test server already sent spell casters into spasms.  The spells don't even have names yet but people are already wearing their "My Spells Only Do 54.918DPS: Everquest is Dead!" T-shirts.  I'll assess Omens of War when I've actually played it, thank you very much.  IGN posted an article about Omens of War with only a few bits of information we didn't know.  I found one line particularly disturbing: "There will be around 20 new zones with this expansion, most of them geared toward GoD-capable players."  From what I've experienced and what I've heard, a "GoD-capable player" is ... no one.  Say it ain't so, Brenlo.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the revamp of Gates of Discord.  I see little change for all of the excitement Sony made over the new revamp.  I still died from see-invis mobs in Barindu after failing at the fourth hour on a Vxed hunt.  I still don't get experience like I do in restricted zones of Fire and Earth.  I've seen no Gates spell drop.  I'm reminded of the fifty "Planes of Power spell drops have increased" patch messages when I've still only seen one non-raid rune drop in all of my days in the Planes.  The changes to KodTaz and above may be nice; apparently it's easier to get into Qvic; but what about the other 93% of casual high-level players (lies, damndable lies, statistics)?  I don't expect another Gates revamp. I'd rather see improvements to Lost Dungeons of Norrath and I look forward to Omens of War; but this big change didn't seem very big to me.</p>

<p>At least young Bolmer, the level 1 Berserker, can take out my frustrations on the skull of a Kobold slaver in the dastardly tunnels of Whatever.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Loral's Evil Agenda</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">31 May 2004</p>

  
<p>Next week SOE is hosting a visit for guild leaders and community representatives to talk about the state of the Everquest and get feedback.  This article outlines the evil agenda I plan to bring to San Diego and hand to the Everquest developers.  </p>

<p>I cannot speak for the entire community. I read the message boards every day.  I play hours every night.  I talk to low level players, high level players, raiders, casual hunters, trade-skillers, and everyone in between and I have no doubt that I am missing the majority of opinions.  We have no idea what all 400,000 players think.  Few players post to message forums. Few players send feedback. Few players even bother to read websites like this one.  It's impossible to know what they think needs to be fixed. I can, however, give my view on the state of Everquest and the features I believe will help the game. </p>

<p>Lets begin Loral's Evil Agenda:</p>

<ul>
<li>Focus on single-group content.</li>
<li>Offer easier corpse recovery in old world and GoD zones.</li>
<li>Offer quest, adventure-point, or vendor alternatives for level 65 and GoD spells.</li>
<li>Offer progressive content in 30 minutes or less.</li>
<li>Add higher-end equipment to LDON adventure merchants.</li>
<li>Add more Lost Dungeon content including zones, adventure types, and rewards.</li>
<li>Make the Sewers, Vxed, and Tipt easier to get to, easier to recover from, easier to battle in, and offer more significant rewards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Focus on single-group content.  The six-person group was once the single unit that all content was balanced against.  Planes of Power and Gates of Discord put raiding and raid-equipped players above moderately equipped single groups.  Increase content for single groups.  Increase high-end equipment opportunities for single group hunters.  Use adventure merchants, expeditions, and instanced zones to bring more content and progression opportunities to single group hunters.  Make the six person group the focus of Everquest again.</p>

<p>Offer easier corpse recovery for old world and Gates of Discord zones.  Planes of Power and Lost Dungeons of Norrath offer excellent escapes for nasty corpse recoveries.  Befallen, Blackburrow, Kaesora, Dalnirs Crypt, and all other old-world dungeons offer no such option.  The Plane of Fear has a higher risk than any raiding zone in Planes of Power.  Don't punish Befallen hunters with horrible corpse recoveries while Plane of Fire hunters recover in 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Offer quest, adventure-point, or vendor alternatives for level 65 and GoD spells.  For single group hunters, level 65 spells are rare and gates of discord spells are almost non-existent.  Offer quests or adventure point systems for high level spells.  Give casual hunters a clear path to these spells.   Place level 65 and GoD spells on LDON adventure merchants or add a similar system to GoD.</p>

<p>Offer progressive content in 30 minutes or less.  Many players have limited play time.  There is little progress anyone can make in thirty minutes.  Many people solo and work on trade skills when they have limited time.  Improve solo content; improve trade skill content; add adventure-point based task systems.</p>

<p>Add higher-end equipment to LDON adventure merchants.  Lost Dungeons offers a fair and consistent method for acquiring equipment.  Players are able to progress towards powerful gear in small steps.  This equipment lacks power when compared to Elemental, Time, and GoD equipment.  Add high-cost equipment with two slot 3s, higher power melee weapons, and augments with the higher-end focus effects such as Marr's Gift, Preservation of Xegony, Mana Regeneration +3 and +4, and Faerune.</p>

<p>Add more Lost Dungeon content including zones, adventure types, and rewards.  Many players love Lost Dungeons and want more adventure types, zones, and lower power raid content.  Add new adventure types and rebalance the rescue and assassination quests.  Increase the cash and experience rewards.  Use the expedition feature of Gates of Discord in Lost Dungeons so people can come and leave in the early parts of an adventure.</p>

<p>Make the Sewers, Vxed, and Tipt easier to get to, easier to recover from, easier to battle in, and offer more significant rewards.  These zones are very hard for their current rewards and many powerful groups fail in the last few minutes of a four hour hunt.  Tune these zones for high level characters without raid-level equipment.</p>

<p>Minor Quips and Suggestions:</p>

<p>Fix sitting animations for male elves.  Why do I still look like a statue when I sit?</p>

<p>Revamp Sky and Fear.  Fear is the only zone left where people cannot get a safe summon at the zone in.  It is the hardest of the Planes with the worst loot.  The time for three-day sky raids is over.  Let Call of the Hero work in Sky.</p>

<p>Debug quests.  A lot of people fail on quests when they hand in stacks.  The rat whisker quest still eats stacks of rat wiskers without returning them.  Buggy quests frustrate players of all levels.  Add better quality control to quest and trade skill content.</p>

<p>Support dual-monitor systems.  I'd love to put my buff and extra chat windows on another monitor while using my main monitor for the world view, target, and group windows.  Duel monitor support adds a lot of capability for high-end systems.</p>

<p>Offer partial refunds on adventure-merchant augments.  A 50% refund wouldn't unbalance the game and would give people some points back for future gear.</p>

<p>No more rats, bats, and spiders.  I've fought these throughout my 65 levels and 260 AA points.  Its time I fought nothing smaller than a armadillo.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The Guild Summit Report</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 8 June 2004</p>

  
<p>It's been quite a weekend. </p>

<p>SOE loves their game.  Almost the entire staff of designers, artists, programmers, customer service representatives, and management are former players who joined SOE because they love the game.  Every attendee of the guild summit I spoke with never felt that SOE fed them a line.  Only twice did Brenlo hold his tongue in response to my questions; one when asked about SOE's plan with IGE and later when asked about focus effects above 65, a subject not yet decided.  Every developer spoke clearly and in detail with every question I asked.</p>

<p>"Gush on, valiant Fanboi!" you shout, but let me reveal the darker side.  Though Smedley said that the bulk of active EQ players were below level 50 I only know of one or two attendees of the sixty that play characters below level 65 and both hardly play anymore.  I learned on the first night that SOE developers have a private forum with raiding guild leaders to discuss raid encounter tuning.  I can't help but wonder why no such forum for single-group players exists.</p>

<p>After nearly ten hours of focus groups and future discussions Brenlo handed out a list of twenty issues SOE would review and implement very soon.  Of these twenty, twelve of them were raid specific and most of the rest were general fixes.  Only one focused on casual content: a solo instanced encounter of some sort.</p>

<p>Many single group issues came up, however, and SOE reacted positively.  I left at least half a dozen copies of Loral's Evil Agenda in the hands of SOE employees including Robert Pfister, Executive Producer of Everquest (who had already read it but politely accepted it before wrapping the remains of his hot dog in it and casually tossing it over his shoulder).</p>

<p>John Smedley stated first that Gates of Discord's release was SOE's worst mistake in five years.  He personally apologized.  I spent my day job listening to managers who speak often and say little.  Smedley was the opposite.  His introduction gave the statistic that most active EQ players are below 50 and revealed that EQ and EQ2 development teams receive royalties for their games individually.  This dispells the theory that SOE is secretly trying to wean us off of EQ and onto EQ2.  The EQ team wants to keep us playing as long as possible.  Rod Humble augmented this address stating that while voices often state that Velious is SOE's best expansion (I still think LDON is), Ykesha is the best selling expansion.  Many attendees attribute this to shared bank space, but I'm not so sure.</p>

<p>Smedley revealed the failed plan to bring out level 65 to 70 during the fifth year anniversary two months ago and Brenlo confirmed that SOE designed Gates of Discord with level 70 in mind.  This explains a lot of the expansion's difficulty.  I spoke with just about anyone who would listen about the overly long duration of sewer, Vxed, and Tipt trials and the designers agreed that four hours for an often failed event was too long.  Whether it's fixed before we see level 70 or not is hard to say.  SOE designed Gates to be very hard.</p>

<p>Later I asked Smedley to confirm the rumor that we would have new PC models before the end of 2004 and he confirmed it.  SOE is outsourcing the project to another company, an act that vexes SOE artists.  It's their baby and they want to do the models but there simply isn't the time, a statement we heard often.  The developers who spoke at the initial meeting stated that they want and expect Everquest to stand up graphically to other current massive online games including EQ2.  The graphic update we battled through recently helps us get there.</p>

<p>The shifting number of allowed players in raid encounters between Planes of Power, Lost Dungeons, and Gates of Discord frustrates a lot of guilds and leads to many players quitting.  Everquest's designers stated that 54 is the new official number for future Everquest raids.</p>

<p>Though focused on raid content, all love of the single-group gamer is not lost.  Brenlo confirmed that new high-end elemental level equipment will update the LDON adventure merchants.  Single-group hunters will be able to gear up for Gates of Discord content without Time or Elemental access.  Omens of War includes only one flagged zone though certain encounters may be locked.  This resembles Kunark, Velious, and Luclin expansions where most of the content was open to all players.  Omens of War includes zones for all players tuned to help characters level up to 70.</p>

<p>SOE based the high cost of AAs on the experience found in the Plane of Fire, a zone many single-group hunters cannot yet reach.  While Omens zones will offer experience zones to help non-flagged hunters, SOE should up the experience in Tipt, Vxed, and the sewers closer to Fire than they are now.  The difficulty in reaching these zones and the difficulty in the encounters warrants the experience boost.</p>

<p>While SOE designed Epic 2.0s to be the best class items available to the most powerful raiders, Epic 1.5s will be available to high level players and require only one or two groups to complete.</p>

<p>It was an amazing weekend filled with the obnoxious rings of cell phones, one so loud that its owner cried out to his deity in shock and horror.  The icy glare of the guild leader from the dark and frightening Rallos Zek server gazed over us bluebies like we had green target circles under our feet.  Twice I became stuck between Gilfalas of Paladin's of Norrath and Raaj of The Steel Warriors who crashed together in debate over Defensive.</p>

<p>Ryan Robinson, the Sheriff of Norrath and customer support supervisor told the story of a trade scam buried under over thirty transfers from different accounts that took two weeks to track down, but they did.  This fellow needs his own Stephen Bocco police drama.  40% of the 47,000 petitions the CS department receives monthly are lost items and 70% of these are scams of some sort.  A lot of CS's day is chasing ghosts.</p>

<p>Here's a brief summary of the things I found most interesting:</p>

<p>- We will have new PC models by the end of the year.<br />
- New high-end high-cost items will be available on LDON adventure merchants.<br />
- Gates was designed for level 70, thats why its so hard.<br />
- Rallos Zek is a chaotic server of horror and villainy.<br />
- Gilfalas just wants "a little something!"<br />
- Omens of War has only one locked zone, the rest of it is open to all players.<br />
- While Epic 2.0s are for the uberist of the ubers, Epic 1.5s are available to the rest of us.<br />
- Some sort of instanced solo adventure is in the works.<br />
- The Omens of War task system, a small 30 minute quest system, will be available to levels 20 and above.<br />
- There will be a quest for Gates of Discord spells, though details aren't available.<br />
- Chat channels cross over between Everquest and Everquest 2.<br />
- The development team wishes they never called it Everquest 2.<br />
- Soon augments can be removed and replaced on other items.<br />
- Smedley loves pirates.<br />
- The graphic engine update we went through will help EQ stay graphically competitive with other MMOGs.</p>

<p>There are dozens of other reports of the summit including posts on Steel Warriors, Paladins of Norrath, The Safehouse, GU Comics, The Rune, Caster's Realm, The Druid's Grove and a lot of places I haven't found yet.  Druid's Grove even has pictures including some unfortunate ones of your fearless writer, Loral (I'm the one in the black shirt on the right).</p>

<p>I received a lot of positive feedback from at least six other attendees I spoke with on the way back home and feedback from the postings above agree.  SOE is working hard to improve Everquest and fix previous mistakes.  Though not all of my agenda points were met; mainly what I wanted to hear was "Lost Dungeons 2 in December"; I am very happy with the direction things are going.  I look forward to the next few months.</p>

<p>Our world is strong.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Return to the Sewers</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">11 June 2004</p>

  
<p>SOE will begin to release changes based on last week's guild summit next week. Only two changes are noted: a Plane of Knowledge stone for Gunthak and a way to clear empty instances of Time, but I wouldn't be surprised to see more soon.</p>

<p>The Gunthak portal helps level 30 to 50 players a lot. It wasn't exactly hard to run through Paineel, Warrens, and Stonebrunt, but its nice to skip them and head right to Gunthak. It saves a lot of time.</p>

<p>The Time change interests Time-capable guilds who ask repeatedly for an instanced Plane of Time. SOE had this at the top of their "future items" list. I heard whispers of a two month process to rebuild Plane of Time into an instanced zone. I would rather see revamps of Fear and Sky than see Time instanced for a select few. Like Sleepers Tomb, North TOV, and Vex Thal, Time will be put aside when the raiding guilds reach deep into Gates of Discord and start to battle in Omens of War. Quick changes to Time are fine but spending two months on it sounds extreme.</p>

<p>SOE is looking at new LDON gear to help smaller groups and guilds gear up for Gates of Discord. This could help open up more options for single-group hunters as well as raiders who need one or two items they can't seem to get in raids. Gates has a lot of single-group instanced trials including the four sewers, Vxed, Tipt, single group hunting in KodTaz, and the three infamous Ikkinz trials. All of these are available to single groups if you're able to get to them and survive. Vxed, Tipt and above are tuned for Plane of Time and "Time+" level players.</p>

<p>The subject of new LDON gear brings up a few unanswered questions. How much will high-end LDON items cost? How powerful will they be? Will there be other requirements to reach them? Some developers feel that simply awarding it for adventure points is too easy, that some sort of greater challenge must exist to acquire these items. I don't agree. While raid leaders and long-time raiders face great challenges, people slip into mature raiding guilds and acquire massive amounts of armor without seeing that challenge. 30 to 60 hours of LDON hunting is long enough to acquire high-end Elemental or Time tier 1 or 2 loot.</p>

<p>Augment swapping is on the way. Augment swapping solvents will most likely require a trade skill to create. There will be a cost associated with augment swapping, but the cost is not yet determined.</p>

<p>SOE also discussed refunding adventure points on LDON items. People may spend 1500 points on a LDON breastplate and then bank it when a new one comes along. SOE hasn't worked out the details yet but a 50% refund has been discussed. Considering my bank is full of my purple Hate armor, my Skyshrine quest armor, and about a dozen outdated bits of treasure, I think a 50% refund is generous. No drop armor is outdated all the time.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention last week that SOE plans to release a level 40 to 55 LDON raid to Stormhammer and then the rest of the servers soon. LDON raids were initially designed for Plane of Time raiders with little else to do. Unfortunately, no raids were developed for lower level or lower power adventurers. The set duration, difficulty, and player numbers of LDON instanced raids allow for extremely tailored raid encounters for all levels. I hope we see more LDON raids for levels 55s to 65s with gear below elemental.</p>

<p>I had a chance to hunt in the Sewers of Barindu recently and enjoyed the changes I saw. The mobs hit for 66% of the damage they used to. Moderately equipped tanks can tank normal mobs and as a Cleric I had to work for a living again without being overwhelmed. The experience was good but could use a boost when compared to the Planes with their graveyards and easy access. Named mobs were still quite hard and a gating mob ended up wiping us out, but the experience was good and the loot was not bad.</p>

<p>My CR was a disaster. I died once in Qinimi on my way back to Barindu, my body got stuck under the earth, and it ended up decomposing before I could get a GM to summon it. I still want more CR options than having to spend two hours after a loss to recover. Death should be painful but there should be options.</p>

<p>Painful CR or not, I will go back to the sewers.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The Book of Gunthak</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">18 June 2004</p>

  
<p>SOE released a large patch this week, one with many changes from the community feedback they received from the guild summit.  Read the full patch message and then continue for today's editorial.</p>

<p>More collision bug fixes should reduce the bugs we've seen even more.  Since the last update I personally haven't seen any of the big collision issues introduced with the Direct X 9 update.</p>

<p>The Plane of Knowledge now has a stone to the boat in Gunthak down in the evil section of the zone.  Lower level players now have much easier access to the zones from Legacy of Ykesha.  Changes allowing players to group and hunt more quickly are always welcome.</p>

<p>Quite a few changes were made to Gates of Discord.  Most of these changes affect zones beyond Kodtaz, a land few people can see.  The beasts that previously dropped class-specific spells now drop tokens.  Turning in the token returns a class appropriate spell.  In my hunts in the sewers, Tipt, and Vxed, I've seen spells drop only three times and each time it was for a class not present.  This is a welcome change.</p>

<p>A scripting change to Plane of Time shuts down unused instances of Time.  This helps guilds who became stuck because of a previous guild.  While Time instancing is still a large issue for high-end guilds, it doesn't appear it will be fixed before Omens of War is released at the end of August.</p>

<p>An NPC in the Plane of Knowledge will now teleport you to the Plane of Hate for a price.  This change has some wizards in uproar; previously the only way to the Plane of Hate was with a wizard's teleport.  The cost is higher for the NPC version and Plane of Hate isn't exactly the most popular zone so I don't see the change as a large one.</p>

<p>A new /guidehelp system lets players ask for assistance with in-game events such as weddings, GM quests, and server events.  I hope to see more GM events in the future.  GM events breathe life into an otherwise static game.  There is a lot of opportunity to enrich Norrath's lore through GM events like the Fironia Vie event in Kunark did years ago.  Most GM events became smaller in scope and did not affect the story line.  If GMs were handed a script or timeline of events to follow, the story of Norrath could grow over time through these dynamic events.</p>

<p>The raid management window received some changes including the ability to add notes to individual players, a Message of the Day feature, and the much needed ability to drop raid members who have left the zone.  Horror stories of raids having to disband and rebuild because of an AFK raid member are over.</p>

<p>The "/stopcast" command has many people scratching their heads.  The main reason people wanted it was to stop casting on horseback but the command specifically does not work on horseback.  SOE never meant horses to allow mana regeneration while moving.  Horses were designed to be a status symbol.  The meditation while riding became the most popular reason to buy a horse.  SOE has no intentions of "fixing" this "bug" but they will not improve it by allowing riders to cancel spells like they can do on their feet.  This has been a long-standing policy with horses and is unlikely to change.</p>

<p>A new PvP test server includes a variety of changes for player versus player combat.  New point-based armor rewards, new spell balancing, and rumors of an in-game hit-list complete with a reward system threaten to make PvP a fun place to play.  The violent and aggravated PvP server citizens receive little in the way of an update so this is a nice change for them.  As long as they don't bleed into my soft blue server and eat newbies, I'm happy.</p>

<p>New Lost Dungeon armor is under discussion though the developers continue to discuss the exact power of this armor.  Hopefully it's equivalent in scope to Elemental and Time items considering the requirement for such equipment in Gates of Discord.</p>

<p>Keep an eye out for some form of augment swapping in the next update.</p>

<p>While the changes in this week's patch mean little to most players, the updates in the future promise some exciting changes for characters of all levels and all paths.  Keep reading!<br />

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Progression in Everquest</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">29 June 2004</p>

  
<p> The short-winded summary:</p>

<p>These days, players have smooth equipment, experience, and zone progression from level 1 to 65 / 100ish AAs. At this point, equipment becomes the only way to progress and the only way to reach new zones. High-level raiders burn through content faster than anyone else, this is why expansions like Gates of Discord and Planes of Power exist. Characters from levels 1 to 64 require new features similar to the new tutorial, the PoK stones, the tribute system, the bazaar, and the LFG tool. Characters at level 65 need new levels, aas, and equipment and need to be able to reach these without raiding. Players at all levels need something meaningful to do in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The longer pontification:</p>

<p>In an interview on the success of Everquest, one of the original designers attributed this success to three things: dependency between classes, social interaction, and progression. Progression keeps us hunting, raiding, trading, and traveling. Without it, Everquest would be AOL Instant Messenger with graphics. With it, Norrath breathes and her people prosper.</p>

<p>Players progress in Everquest in three main areas: experience, loot, and zones. Everyone from levels 1 to 65 seek out these three almost infinite goals as they travel through Norrath. When one line of progression begins to slow down, we focus on the other two. If two lines slow, we go for the third. If the third slows, we become tired and weak and spend our days writing angry messages to Brenlo.</p>

<p>Levels are the most basic form of progression; offering the largest changes in power but also the largest difficulty in development time. SOE offset the difficulty in implementing level increases with Alternate Advance points. AAs are easier to design and implement, use the same experience method as levels, and don't threaten to unbalance the game. Equipment upgrades are the second most common way to progress in Everquest.</p>

<p>Most don't think about zones as a form of progression, but it is the only one that visibly changes as character levels increase. While gear and levels generally increase arbitrary numbers, zones look and act far differently from one another. One of the reasons we want to get to level 30 is to see Dawnshroud Peaks. One of the reaons we want to get to 45 is to see The Gray. 46 lets us enter the hideous planes of Disease, Nightmare, and (*shiver*) Fear. Each of these zones offers new hideous rats, bats, and spiders for us to destroy. Many of us dreamed of that firey doorway into Fear and dreamed of the day we could face Cazic's hellish minions. Today, many of us can reach that world (Tunare knows why we would want to), and now we dream of the furthest reaches of the Elemental Planes, the Plane of Time, or the lost temples of Taelosia.</p>

<p>Progression changed much over the last five years. New tools like the Knowledge portals, the bazaar, the tutorial, quest armor, and instanced dungeons change how players progress today from how we did so many years ago.</p>

<p>Characters progress in level, equipment, and zones steadily and continuously throughout most of the game. While the shift from soloing to grouping around level 30 becomes more difficult; sometimes it's all we can do to find a group; there is no lack of new items in the bazaar to purchase, new zones to hunt in, or new levels to gain.</p>

<p>From level 20 on, there are instanced dungeons in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath and even a new instanced expedition in Natimbi that allows most characters below 50 solo without interruption by other players. The instanced dungeons offer unlimited experience zones from level 20 to level 65; over-camped hunting zones are history. If you can get three people together, you can at least try a Lost Dungeon even if you aren't successful in the adventure.</p>

<p>Equipment progression is also smooth from level 1 to perhaps level 64. Nice items with restrictive level recommendations can be purchased for low prices, higher end items cost more but upgrades are usually for sale at reasonable prices. Players lower than 65 may want to camp a rare item or two, but they may better spend their time acquiring levels and save that equipment camping time for later. Occasionally one might get a nice dropped item and another may pay for something with adventure points in LDON, but the best value for the time spent comes from the bazaar below 60.</p>

<p>Characters of all levels now have the opportunity for constant experience progression at every level. Every level has zones full of dark-blue beasts that offer between 1% and 2% experience every battle. Alternate Advanced skills help off-set those who raced to 65 and it isn't until each class crosses over perhaps 100 to 150 AA points (each the equivalent of leveling from 50 to 51) that the diminishing returns of the skills outweigh the desire to acquire them. Who really wants to spend four hours so you don't eat food so quickly. Achieving level 65 with 150 AA points takes quite a long time. However, many have spent that time and much more. How do they generally progress? Equipment.</p>

<p>Most level 65s with moderate to high AAs begin to focus on equipment. It is their equipment and the equipment of their guild that gets them into the deeper reaches of the Planes of Power which lead to ... more equipment, which leads to Gates and ... more equipment. The cycle continues. New items are replaced with newer items with 10 more hitpoints. Raiders bank priceless no-drop gear many times over for that new shiny item.</p>

<p>It is at this time when the game changes. While high-end equipment in the Lost Dungeons adventure points exists, as do high-priced items in the bazaar, most powerful equipment for level 65s comes from raiding. In order to progress into new zones, you must have the right equipment. The only way to get that equipment is to raid.</p>

<p>Times were far worse than they are now. In the early days of Planes of Power, the excessive use of flags practically required raiding in order to get any of the three forms of progression. If you wanted new gear, new zones, or experience for new levels and AAs, raiding was your best option. Many friend-guilds split apart to feed the massive raiding guilds. For these guilds, raiding wasn't a fun side-adventure like it was in the days of Nagafen, raiding is their business and they do it every day.</p>

<p>The opening of many lower-tier planes and the new zones in Gates of Discord helped solve narrow direction. The sewers, Tipt, and Vxed offer experience rewards close to the deeper Planes. Zones like Ferubi and the first sets of the Breakdown in Communication quest give two or three groups a shot at some nice gear.</p>

<p>However, the gap still exists. The easiest way to acquire new equipment and new zones, two of the three forms of progression, is to join a raiding guild. Most people hit the wall of usefulness in AA progression at this point, whatever their guild. Equipment is the primary progression method and equipment leads to new zones.</p>

<p>It is this gap I ask SOE to fill. The Lost Dungeon adventure point system lets players work in small increments towards powerful gear. It lets SOE control the flow of equipment by controlling prices. LDON gear is no-drop so it doesn't effect the economy. Many times I recommended that SOE increase LDON gear to off-set the requirements for progression through raiding.</p>

<p>However even this should be a small focus for SOE. SOE needs to make the game more enjoyable at all levels. New features for all players keep them playing. Features like the tribute system (that admittedly needs work), the knowledge portals, soul binders, extra bank slots, armor dyes, and the bazaar help all players.</p>

<p>Low and mid-level players need new features as well although probably not through level, equipment, or zone content but with features that help them find groups or spend shorter amounts of time playing with profitable results.</p>

<p>Not every new feature helps every player, Everquest needs new raiding content, new levels above 65, new equipment beyond Time, especially when we see how far and fast powerful players travel through existing content. For these players, the faster they can get through the game the better, although it leads them faster and faster to the black gaping hole of space known as "the endgame". If they see it, they see the emptiness of their own progression. They see that none of it is real. They travel through that black void and end up in strange worlds of night elves or perhaps even a super-hero fighting armies of TV-helmeted villains. It is the will of the gods and the job of SOE to make sure we never see that black void. </p>
  


  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Summit Changes Round 2</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 6 July 2004</p>

  
<p>A patch due out next week offers a lot of good changes for players of all levels including safe augment removals, Lost Dungeon adventure point refunds for unused gear, changes to the tribute system, changes to the user interface, some new zones and zone revamps, and changes to pets.</p>

<p>For a price between 1 and 4000 platinum players can purchase solvents that remove augments from items without destroying them.  There are eighteen such solvents with prices that increase depending on the power of the augment.  Low-end augments cost one or two platinum; the 1500 point LDON augments cost 1000 platinum, and raid-level Gates of Discord augments cost around 4000 platinum.</p>

<p>Adventure merchants on test now buy back LDON purchased equipment at 50% of its original cost including the augments mentioned above.</p>

<p>While the changes above don't add more powerful items to the adventure merchants, it helps players replace and purchase more of the existing higher-end items.  The ability to trade in unused equipment allows players to purchase more of the current high-end armor and augments.</p>

<p>New Lost Dungeon raiding zones make their way to Stormhammer and the Live servers next week.  A 40 to 55 Lost Dungeon raid moves from Stormhammer to the regular servers while Stormhammer receives a 55 to 65 raid for sub-elemental equipped raiders.  These additions may help improve the use and perception of Lost Dungeon raids which did not meet the expectations of either lower-power or higher-power raiding groups.</p>

<p>The test server also includes an excellent change to the tribute system.  Players will soon activate tributes when needed with an activate button.  Players are immediately charged the point cost for whatever tributes they selected from their tribute master in their home town.  Activated tributes last ten minutes and can be reactivated when needed.  This change drastically improves the tribute system.</p>

<p>Pets for all pet classes will soon zone along with their master.  Like the current beastlord warders and the Wizard's Mr. Flappy Flap, pets for all pet classes will now travel across zones and last during short link-deaths.  This is a huge improvement for pet classes..</p>

<p>Some new changes to the interface include visible buff timers and a numeric mana pool display.  Players have asked to see an exact mana count for years and they will finally have it.  The buff duration timer, though available for 15 leadership points, helps people manage their buffs a lot easier.  Expect to see all new user interfaces with both of these features.</p>

<p>SOE will release a rebuild of Veeshan's Peaks, the first locked raiding zone in Everquest, next week.  Those with a key to the old Veeshan's Peaks have to perform one last piece of the quest to gain access to the new VP while those without the old key must go through a new quest to gain access.  The zone is tuned for Elemental-level raids.</p>

<p>I had more of an opportunity to hunt in the Gates of Discord over the past few weeks and I continue to find improvements since the recent Gates revamp.</p>

<p>A few nights ago I took a group between 60 and 65 into the explorers version of the Sewers.  Players can spawn two different versions of the sewer expeditions; one that does not lead to a flag for Kodtaz and one that does.  The non-flagging version seems a lot easier for a mid 60s group.  Though we saw no rare beasts and received no treasure beyond some platinum, the beasts did not hit nearly as hard as they once did.  We earned over 1% experience per kill, around the same experience as Valor, and did so in an instanced zone.</p>

<p>The last patch included changes to the spell drops in Gates.  Instead of dropping a class specific spell, a rune dropped that could be traded in by any spell casting class for their own class specific spell.  What wasn't mentioned is that the drop rates for these runes was decreased.  Some players report killing over one dozen named mobs and not receiving a single spell.  I know dozens of level 65s who spend a lot of time in Gates and still have not a single spell.  While SOE considers spells to be loot; not everyone should have them all; spells are one of the selling points of a new expansion and when we cannot even get one of them we don't feel like we're getting our money's worth.</p>

<p>Every expansion should have at least one or two spells for sale on top of higher-end spell drops.  Only ancient spells should be so exclusive.</p>

<p>I've had a lot of interesting comments and heated discussions with developers and players regarding equipment progression for single-group hunters.  With the refunds and safe augment removal changes to Lost Dungeons and the items available in Riwwi, Ferubi, Barindu, the sewers, Vxed, and Tipt, it may be possible for a single group to progress into Kodtaz and the Ikkinz trials without requiring elemental and time gear.  A few higher-end items in LDON would not unbalance the game and would help single-group hunters with limited time see more of what Gates has to offer.</p>

<p>Since the guild summit we've seen a lot of improvements to Everquest and next week's patch is no different.  Most of these changes help players of all levels and most classes.  Small improvements like the selective activation of the tribute system, the new user interface labels, the LDON safe augment removal and and point refunds, improve the game significantly.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The Advantages of Point-based Loot</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">13 July 2004</p>

  
<p>This week's Mobhunter discusses the advantages of a point-based loot system.  While Everquest primarily uses random drops to reward players with equipment, Lost Dungeons of Norrath showed us a new, fair, and powerful loot system.  It is my hope that we see systems like this used more in the future.</p>

<p>Along with instanced dungeons and content scaled for all levels, the Lost Dungeons expansion brought us the adventure merchants.  This new method for acquiring treasure rewarded each member of a group with points they could spend on new items.  This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the adventure point system.</p>

<p>The adventure point system lets developers tune equipment directly against the effort required to acquire it.  A Breastplate of the Sands always takes 1492 adventure points.  At a minimum this takes 15 hard adventures at level 65 or 15 hours at a minimum to complete.  Most likely it takes 30 hours; 30 normal adventures at level 65.  Random loot, in comparison, may drop the top item the first time or the 500th time.  Even the developers do not know how often it will drop.  Developers control the odds of a dropped item but they do not directly control the drop rates.</p>

<p>Adventure point systems reward all participants in an event evenly.  Adventure point systems also offer clear progression towards equipment goals. Each adventurer wins and each adventurer knows how much closer they are to the item they desire after each adventure. </p>

<p>For years many high-end raiding guilds used a point-system for raid loot distribution called the Dragon Kill Point system.  This system, maintained by the leadership of the guild, awarded loot to the members of the guild who deserved it most based on attendance.  This works well for most guilds but works poorly for less organized groups.  Such systems face corruption or destruction when the leaders either move on or turn sour.  </p>

<p>While the DKP system works well for many high-end guilds, a game-based point system works for everyone.  Any player from any guild can earn points by attending encounters or adventures that award points.  They may hunt with a different group every day but every day they earn points.  For unguilded or lower-end guilds, such systems help players grow steadily towards their goals.  Point-based systems help facilitate pick up groups between players who do not know each other but may one day grow into great friends.  It rewards players without regard to their guild tag and does not require the sacrifice of a group for the progress of an individual.</p>

<p>There are some problems with an adventure point system.  The wide range of armor available on the same point systems in LDON rewards everyone with progress at the most powerful gear.  Because any player of level 20 can go to the Lost Dungeons, they begin earning points towards the high-end armor right away.  The only thing in the way of top-end gear is time.  Regardless of how easy LDON missions become, the points each player earns always lets that player buy new gear.</p>

<p>Dedicated adventure loot for specific content solves this problem.  The sewers in Gates of Discord have a set difficulty  Level 65 pre-elemental level.  The developers know how difficult the sewers are and tuned it for a specific group.  They also know that Elemental armor would benefit this group.  They do not want players gaining elemental loot every time they enter the dungeon so instead they make them rare drops.  The problem with rare drops is that even the developers don't know if this treasure drops the first time or the fiftieth.  The players are not progressing towards this gear, they hope for a good loot table roll and a good roll against the other players.  It can turn players against one another instead of supporting them all equally.</p>

<p>Instead, consider a sewer trial that rewards each player with one sewer point for each completion of a sewer expedition.  Our friend, Mordin Rasp, offers us Elemental-level loot for ten points each.  Do ten sewers, get a nice item.  For the Tipt / Vxed trials, offer a different set of loot on a different point system.  Loot is carefully controlled and is directly based on the difficulty of the encounter and the time one needs to spend in it.  The loot system cannot be corrupted by other players and everyone in the trial earns something for their effort.</p>

<p>Point-based loot should not replace random drops.  Developers design random loot to be a surprise to players, not something to be farmed over and over.  A mixture of point-based loot and random loot helps ensure players can gear up for new content but doesn't remove the excitement of getting a surprise item off of a hideous beast.</p>

<p>Point-based loot works well for progressive loot like the basic armor.  Chest, wrist, leg, feet, head, hands and arm equipment could come from point-based systems while rings, earrings, masks, and necklaces, may still come from lucky random drops.  Players work steadily towards progressive armor while still receiving random equipment for secondary slots.</p>

<p>The point based system of Lost Dungeons of Norrath was one of the great improvements of Everquest.  SOE has no plans to further capitalize on this system.  While it is not the solution to loot in Everquest, it offers many advantages in many situations over random drops and dice roll rewards.  It rewards groups of strangers as well as guilds.  It helps all players earn gear required for further progression.  Much in the same way a Player vs Environment system fosters cooperation, point-based loot systems rewards successful groups, not lucky individuals.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Swapping, Selling, and Soloing</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">30 July 2004</p>

  
<p> Last week's update gave us quite a few improvements. Both the LDON adventure-point trade-in and the safe augment removal system went in and both work quite well. At the last moment SOE changed the refund value to 70% from 50%. The 20% increase combats the problem of adventurers skipping mid-level gear and saving up for only high-end gear. The 300 and 750 point armor sets are much more desirable now that one can return them when one decides to upgrade. With the save augment removal one can move augments from older to newer sets of this armor.</p>

<p>The changes to Lost Dungeons go a long ways towards helping single-group hunters equip themselves for the harder content in Gates of Discord. While we will not receive new LDON equipment until after Omens of War, these changes bring new life to LDON.</p>

<p>The new tribute change improves the value of Gates of Discord for players under level 55. The ability to start and stop tributes gives players a bit more control over these chaotic and expensive effects. The tribute system is much improved over the original.</p>

<p>The ability for zoning pets made a lot of pet classes happy. Now the equipment and buffs one gives a pet last a lot longer. Now if only pet classes could name their pets. Identity is everything.</p>

<p>A new LDON raid on Stormhammer focused on two groups of level 55 to 65. Early reports from my Stormhammer spy network state that the raid is quite a bit harder than level 55 equating it more towards Elemental / Time level. LDON raids offer much unused potential. SOE could easily build Vox / Naggy type raid encounters for all levels and equipment power using the expeditions of Gates. They could focus on two, three, four, five, or six groups. They could bring raiding to everyone, not just the most powerful guilds, but instead they focus most raid content on Elemental / Time level guilds.</p>

<p>Currently LDON raids offer too little reward for their difficulty. Raiding guilds skip them because of low rewards and everyone else skips them because of their high difficulty. The easiest way to fix this problem is to lower the difficulty and lower the reset time of these events. They offer too much potential to let them rot.</p>

<p>The Veeshan's Peak revamp made it to live servers with the last update. A new quest parallel to the old one both lead to a new raid event in Skyfire mountains. Another hideous shade of the Dar challenges elemental level players and rewards them with access to the revamped elemental-level raiding and hunting zone. I would complain about another hunting zone blocked by raid-level encounters but there is a lot of unlocked single-group content at the elemental level in Gates now including Riwwi, Tipt, Vxed, and the sewer trials.</p>

<p>Though listed on the top ten items SOE would focus on after the guild summit, it appears we will not see solo instanced adventures at least until after Omens of War. Again, I would complain except that raid-focused requests such as the instancing of Time also face the same timeline. There is a simple explanation for the delay; it takes too much time for the amount of work solo instanced adventures require.</p>

<p>Some asked for SOE to reduce the number of required players from three to two or one but this doesn't solve one of the biggest problems with soloing, not everyone can solo and some solo far better than others. For some, soloing is more profitable than grouping. That is simply broken. Grouping should always offer a higher gain than soloing for all classes. Soloing should be desired only when time restricts a player too much to group.</p>

<p>Only two solutions solve this problem. Increase the ability for a class to solo where needed or focus content around each class so each class solos effectively. Both of these changes require extensive work both in development and in balancing. New solo abilities could unbalance a class in grouping and raiding creating another round of "my class is worse than your class" woes. New content requires a lot of development work for little gain. Building an entire zone, even if it's small, for a single class only reaches a fraction of its possible population.</p>

<p>The delay of instanced solo content puts a lot of weight on the shoulders of the new Omens of War task system. It may be too much weight to bear if Sony doesn't find other solutions.</p>

<p>The real problem comes down to limited content for people with limited time. People with only 30 minutes to play need something useful to do. If they're a wizard, they can go solo but if they're a warrior, life isn't as easy. Tradeskills and quests help but not enough. Adding new mini-games might help. Additional quests like the low level newbie quests but for middle and high level hunters might help as well. Everquest requires short duration content, in whatever form it decides to take.</p>

<p>Hobart's testing thread shows us the updates we'll see in future days. This includes new multi-slot augments for slot 7 and 8 augments; consenting options for groups, raids, and guilds; and a new system-friendly Everquest that lets you cap your framerate. My machine's whole purpose in life is to run Everquest so I see little reason to focus it but I suppose some people want to watch others rip their cars in half on Ebaums World while raiding Uqua.</p>

<p>In the last sixty days we've seen many excellent improvements for all players. While a lot of cynics, myself included, have accused SOE of focusing on raid-level content, they showed their level of support to all players regardless of level or play style. Gates shifted from an expansion for only a select few to offering up some excellent zones and encounters. Simple changes like the Gunthak stone, tribute activation, LDON point returns, and the excellent tutorial helps old and new players of every class and level. A bright future lays ahead.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The New Mobhunter</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">11 August 2004</p>

  
<p>Over the past few weeks the tinkering gnomes at Mobhunter installed and tested a new version of the site you so dearly love.  Give the New Mobhunter Design a look and try out the new comment system.  There were quite a few reasons for a change and the new version offers a few advantages over the previous version including the following:</p>

<p>- Both the homepage and each article should load faster.</p>

<p>- Both the homepage and each article has a simpler design suitable for printing and reading on smaller screens.</p>

<p>- Comments are now flat instead of threaded.  Read all new comments at once instead of clicking through the threads.</p>

<p>- The links on the homepage are now updated and easier to maintain.</p>

<p>- The site continues to have the same clean look you appreciate.</p>

<p>- Mobhunter now has both a Really Simple Syndication 2.0 and ATOM newsfeed for headline syndication.  For more information about news syndication, read Yahoo's RSS page.</p>

<p>- For you HTML Tech-heads, the site now supports XHTML 1.1, CSS 2.0, and W3C Accessibility guidelines for the disabled.</p>

<p>- The new version includes dynamic space-age knowledge scripts to add 24% more wacky pop-culture references.  You'll be wearing your pants backwards and singing "Jump, Jump" before you can spell "Chia-pet".</p>

<p>The comment system will take a little bit of getting used to and we may make changes for the articles that get over fifty comments.  Please give it a good test.  Assuming we get the kinks smoothed out, we will release the new version in a couple of weeks.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The Calm Before the Storm</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">11 August 2004</p>

  
<p>We seem to sit within the valley between one expansion and the next.  We had some great new patches since the release of Gates of Discord, and we hear of some nice future updates.  Even with Omens of War on the horizon we sit here in the gap of a slow news week all the same.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting threads floating around within the Everquest community is Hobart's Test Server Update.  If you ever want to see what new changes we should expect in the next patch, thats the place to go look.</p>

<p>The most recent updates to the test server include a lot of features for the raid tool.  Raid leaders will soon be able to lock and unlock a raid, remove group leader flags from raiders, remove players from any group within the raid, and buttons to put group members into other groups.  These changes are wonderful organizational changes and may be the best changes to the raid tool since its release back in Planes of Power.  Even for smaller two or three group raids, it is wonderful to be able to switch which player is in which group without going through the shuffle.</p>

<p>Now, of course, this will lead to whole fields of raiders going AFK while raids organize and may lead raid leaders to ask for the next logical update: "Give me a Warcraft 3 interface so I can just control the whole raid myself".  I kid, of course.  These changes help raiders quite a bit and feedback from summit raid leaders has been very good.</p>

<p>Along with new raid organization functions comes new consent functions.  Many raiders and even a few groupers want more powerful consenting features for corpse dragging.  More than a few players see death as a nice opportunity for a much needed AFK break frustrating draggers to no end when they must send "CONSENT PLZZ" about fifty times before getting a response.  Soon players can consent guilds, consent groups, and consent raids for dragging.  Again, these improvements help solve a lot of problems mainly for raiding guilds.</p>

<p>Expect new hunting hot spots with the next patch, says Brenlo of the Hairy Feet.  Hot spots, zones with increased zone experience modifiers, help push players to explore some areas to which they might not always travel by rewarding them with much improved experience gain.  The current hot spots existed for some time now and a change is due.  We don't know which zones will turn into hot spots yet, but many await the change.  Hot spots are a great feature for mid-level players.</p>

<p>A thread on the Stormhammer server forums sheds a harsh light on the 12 person LDON raid recently released on Stormhammer and moving soon to the live servers.  While I heard it was tuned for level 55s to 65s, a few players who actually tried it say it is tuned for Elemental, Time, and GoD equipped players.  These equipment restrictions put this raid in the same category as all of the LDON raids.  They are too hard, restricted to only Elemental+ equipped players, and offer too little a reward to make it attractive to those able to accomplish it.</p>

<p>The LDON raid system and the Gates of Discord Expedition system offer a lot of potential for mid-levelers and non-raiders to experience some of the fun and excitement of raiding.  These expeditions can offer raid-level content at any set level with restrictions on who can enter and how often without blocking it behind a rare flag-mob.  This new two-group raid looked like a great way to get 55s to non-raid-equipped 65s into some Lost Dungeon raids but it appears it is just another raid for the top-tier raiders.  With all of the unused raid content of LDON, I don't know why SOE tuned this event for the same players who already ignore LDON raids.</p>

<p>We have seen little new information on Omens of War.  Everyone has questions about how it will support their play-style.  No one knows what levels 66 to 70 will do to older expansions like Lost Dungeons and Gates.  SOE released no official word on existing level 65 focus effects but rumors speak of a nice flexible solution.  The task system interests a lot of people but I still feel too much weight falls onto it.  It may be doomed just by the sheer amount of attention it will get.  I hope it lives up to the expectations but only time will tell.</p>

<p>With the lack of other major news, people spread to their sixteen camps and began the class wars once again.  SOE plans to provide class definition documents that they have worked on for some time now.  These definitions help define what each classes role is in a group and in a raid.  I don't know if they will cover soloing but I do believe they cover a class from levels 1 to 65 (probably to 70).</p>

<p>Every class should bring a combination of abilities to a group at all levels that sets it apart from other classes.  No one class should be better in all ways than another.  Every class should have options and use for soloing, grouping, and raiding.  Every class should have a unique identity and background.</p>

<p>Feedback on the new Mobhunter design has been good and very useful.  Our plan is to switch over to the new version next Saturday.  Please give the new Mobhunter design a look and try out the comment system.</p>

<p>I have a small update on one of my secondary requests on Loral's Evil Agenda.  It appears with Nvidia-based video cards, one can span Everquest across two windows.  I had little luck with an Nvidia Geforce 5500; the EQ window never got bigger than about 2400 pixels wide; but the new Geforce 6800 GT runs EQ in a window 3200 x 1150 pixels wide for a total of 3.6 million pixels.  There are a couple of problems, however.  One cannot run in full screen mode or they crash to desktop and the window can't be a full 3200 x 1200 or it slows down to one frame a second.  If you don't mind seeing your start bar all the time, it can be a wild way to play.  </p>

<p>Why would someone want to play across two monitors?  If one runs a "/viewport 1601 0 1600 1150" they get a normal EQ view on the right monitor and a black background on the other.  Chats, maps, inventories, spell gems, buffs, and any other windows you don't have to see right away can be thrown over to the other monitor.</p>

<p>Its a bit of a gimmick but it is a neat way to play.  Here is a picture of Everquest running across two monitors.</p>

<p>Look forward to an editorial on Everquest's current state of corpse recovery in the next two weeks and until then, play on.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Five Steps to One Million Subscribers</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">27 August 2004</p>

  
<p>I want to see one million people playing Evequest.  I want to see Sony Online Entertainment double the subscribers they currently have.  I do not have a master's degree in business or marketing but that never stopped me from having an opinion before and it won't stop me now.  This article outlines five steps to improve Everquest's success.</p>

<p>Loral's Marketeer Five Step Evil PowerPoint Slide for the success of Everquest:</p>

<p>- Continue to release fresh retail versions of Everqust.  Make it clear to the consumer which one they should buy and cheap enough to compete with newer MMOGs.</p>

<p>- Update the PC models and graphics to compete with newer MMOGs and make EQ look like a brand new game.</p>

<p>- Release another Lost Dungeons of Norrath style expansion with scaling content for levels 20 to 70.</p>

<p>- Simplify the interface; perform usability studies; simplify the skill and discipline system.</p>

<p>- Improve Everquest stability; make patches modem friendly; offer updated versions of EQ on DVD as DVD drives proliferate.</p>

<p>Step 1: Market Everquest as a new game every expansion and offer a free version.  The release of the Everquest Platinum edition greatly improved SOE's chances for increasing subscribers.  For $30, a new player gets the basic game, all seven current expansions, and a month to try it out.</p>

<p>Release the basic game with a one month trial for free to let people try the game out.  Pass this single-disc version around like AOL.  Have people making coasters out of it and throwing it at that guy hovering over by the fax machine.  While the current free download helps, the sheer size of the game makes it almost inaccessible to new players.  Offering free CDs in gaming stores, magazines, and bulk mail will bring in a lot of new players.</p>

<p>Continually update this $30 version with everything but the most recent expansion.    Pull older versions off the shelves.  Make it clear which versions players need to buy.</p>

<p>Step 2:  Update player character graphics.  There are no graphics more important than PC graphics.  When people shop for a new MMOG, player graphics are the first thing they see.  Everquest has excellent world and beastie graphics, but the current player graphics need work.</p>

<p>SOE plans to release new player graphics by the end of the year.  It is important that they stick to this deadline.  EQ2, Worlds of Warcraft, and Final Fantasy X offer brand new and fresh player graphics.  New PC graphics is SOE's first chance to impress new players, it is the first graphics a new player sees. New player graphics are the most important change this year.</p>

<p>Player graphics require three things to succeed.  They must scale well on existing systems and offer good performance during raids.  They must be customizable enough to create unique characters identifiable from far away.  They must be good enough to let us escape into the lives of our characters.  </p>

<p>Step 3:  Release another Lost Dungeon-like expansion.  Lost Dungeons of Norrath offers the most highly scalable content in any of the previous expansions.  LDON offers usable and rewarding content from level 20 to level 65.  Mobs are always blue.  Treasure and rewards scale well.  Groups are easy to find and the camps are well connected.  The dungeons allow for easy corpse recovery but still offer a good challenge.  Players can finish an event in between 45 and 90 minutes.</p>

<p>A new Lost Dungeons expansion should use the Gates of Discord expedition system so players can leave if they have to.  Like LDON, it should allow players to work towards powerful items in small steps.  The storylines should put the players in the role of the hero and not the errand boy.  The storyline should progress as the players hunt.  Threats should seem real.  Adventure types should reward the players equally for equal difficulty and there should be a wider variety of them than the current ones.</p>

<p>Step 4: Simplify the interface.  Everquest's interface is very difficult for new players.  The basic controls alone require a lot of work but stack on communications and character improvement interfaces and you have one of the most complex game interfaces ever seen.</p>

<p>Reduce the number of windows a player must go through to set up disciplines.  Start all skills at 1 so they will raise on their own instead of requiring a player to run back and check with a guild master every couple of levels to see if there is a skill they missed.  Tell the player when a new discipline is available and let them scribe it like a spell.  Streamline the hotbox macro creation process so it is easy to build complex macros mixing skills, disciplines, spells, and other commands.</p>

<p>Perform usability tests with new players to see where interface elements break down and where they can be improved.  Basic usability tests are cheap to perform and can easily improve profits on even simple systems.</p>

<p>Simplify the interface and more players will stick with the game.</p>

<p>Step 5: Improve stability and lower network requirements.  When I first played Everquest Online Adventures on the Playstation 2, I was impressed by two things.  One, they download patches into three megs of space and it never gets any bigger.  Two, they focus almost entirely on game enhancements instead of stability improvements.</p>

<p>Make Everquest as stable as a console game.  Improve hardware testing and application testing so that players can reasonably expect the game to work every time they log in.  Many players still face a variety of technical issues and these issues are far more damaging to the game than almost any content problem.  The chaos of PC architectures makes testing very difficult.  Stability should be a number one concern for SOE developers.</p>

<p>The large patches that Everquest players face require a high-speed connection.  While the game itself plays well over dial up, downloading two hundred megs of updates cut off a lot of players from playing.  As DVD drives become more common on newer machines, offer Everquest with all expansions on a single DVD but lock the content the user didn't pay for.  Update this DVD with the most recent large patches so even existing players can go get the updates from a game magazine or from their local game shop.  Keep patches small and consider dial up players when they are released.  No patch should take longer than 30 minutes to download.  Even thirty minutes will cut out a lot of players.</p>

<p>I don't claim that these five steps are the keys to the success and future of Everquest, but from the five years I've played this game, the above steps seem to be the ones most hindering to new players.  New players are the key to success for Everquest in the years to come.  While a lot of players would rather SOE focus on the top 1%, that 1% is going to go away eventually and only by bringing in new and fresh players can Everquest continue to grow into the future.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Visions and Omens</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">27 August 2004</p>

  
<p>The Omens beta began in full last week.  Larger guilds began testing out raid encounters while the rest of us ran Guktan wizards to the corners of the world marveling at the strange sights.</p>

<p>Most of Omens of War reminds me of Kunark.  The architecture and the plight of the Dragorn empire squeezed within the Muramite's iron gauntlet creates a lot of similarities to the Iksar and their post-Shissar empires.  Massive castles and spired walls stretch across the green landscape.  Orange and red clouds flow over hills and ravines.</p>

<p>A first glance shows us nine open over-land zones and three sets of instanced expeditions: the caves, the sewers, and the catacombs, each with about four or five variants.  More zones await discovery.  The first overland zone and the first set of instanced expeditions supports level 45+ with beasts lower in power than those in Natimbi.  The beasts grow in power quickly beyond that point.</p>

<p>There looks to be some excellent hunting zones between 60 and 70, although I imagine SOE developers continue to tune experience modifiers.  Between Planes of Power, Gates of Discord, Lost Dungeons, and Omens of War zones, there appears to be no lack of hunting areas for any level up to 70.</p>

<p>I have seen no equipment or loot so I cannot know yet if the power-gap between single-group hunters and raiders will close in at all.  Hopefully Omens offers enough single-group equipment to get players through the single-group trials of Gates.  Too long have the mountain trials, Kodtaz, and the Ikkinz trials been closed to non-raiders.</p>

<p>Lists of new Omens of War alternate advance abilities popped up everywhere on Friday.  While the lists contain no associated costs for these skills, many of them are surprisingly good.  A lot of changes that we never expected to see began to show up.  New spell-gem slots, new buff slots, a gate for everyone, two binding areas for wizards, and a surprisingly large increased mana regeneration cap for pure casters.  I can only really speak for clerical abilities but the list looks good, with a lot of basic improvements to our core function including improved healing gift, healing adapt, celestial rejuvenation, and our first critical heal over time ability.  I purchased few AAs for Gates, but now I am glad I saved up the points for Omens abilities.</p>

<p>One nice thing about new Alternate Advance skills is that any player can acquire them regardless of where they hunt.  They don't get stuck on your body when you wipe out in Fear and they don't require camping obscure mobs in obscure places for a 1 in 6 chance at that one last spell you needed.</p>

<p>Spells in Omens are distributed with runes, one rune per level, similar to Gates of Discord.  SOE developers compared it to Planes of Power.  Spells will not be duplicated.  What isn't known is the difficulty in acquiring spells.</p>

<p>Task system testing also began late last week.  While continued testing and balancing needs to occur before release, the skeleton of the system shows promise.  Single players are able to complete tasks in under an hour and earn a noticeable reward for doing so.  The reward is nice enough to make a difference but small enough to keep players from ignoring requests for groups.  Single groups should always be the core Everquest hunting team.</p>

<p>The task system is the one feature of Omens that supports players from level 20 to (hopefully) 70.  SOE brings up the task system whenever the requests for solo instanced encounters arise.  I don't believe any system can match up to the expectations people have for it.  It will take a few such systems to cover all of the needs and desires for short-duration content.</p>

<p>The official website of Omens of War includes a couple of new features I hadn't yet heard about.  One of them, a voice macro of some sort, shows a lot of promise.  Now an interesting show on Tivo won't kill half a group in eight seconds.  Now raid leaders can wake up that 20% of their raid who always seems to be asleep.  None of this is yet in the beta so I cannot say exactly how it works.</p>

<p>This week, the Omens of War developers and SOE community represenatives had an moderated chat with players.  EQ Stratics posted a log of the transcript.  Few details are given, but topics such as spells, new epic quests, content for players under 50, and solo instances all came up.</p>

<p>Omens of War brings us over a dozen new zones, half of them instanced.  It expands the physical worlds of Norrath even further.  I wonder if SOE might best spend their time working on new expansions that take Everquest into directions other than new zones to explore.  Everquest is certainly wide, it is the largest physical game I've ever played, but it isn't very deep.  The vast majority of content builds around combat against bosses.  The numbers increase but the gameplay is generally the same.  New lines of progression need to be developed.</p>

<p>I could sit here and come up with ideas stolen from other role playing games, but I am sure SOE's developers can do the same so I will leave it into their capable hands.  I heard some exciting ideas thrown around at the guild summit and I only hope they attempt to run with some of them.  Omens is a strong expansion and its release opens up the future into entirely new possibilities.  Now is the time to consider and develop those new possibilities.  The world is yours.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The Focus and the Flip Flop</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 3 September 2004</p>

  
<p>In case you live in Paw, the great Foci debate spread across every Everquest related forum on the entire web.  This official notice declares that all foci will begin scaling at a rate of 10% per spell level after the level cap of the foci.  This means Spell Haste 4, a 15% reduction in casting time up to level 65, will drop to 13.5% at level 66, 11% at level 67, and so on until it reaches 7.5% at level 70.</p>

<p>This has most high-end raiders in a fury.  They spent months working through very difficult encounters in Gates of Discord where foci of 45% on some items will drop to 22.5% at level 70.  Some call this the worst nerf ever even though it's not a nerf but an enhancement.  SOE made a far better decision than letting the items cut off at 65 as they were advertised to do.</p>

<p>Originally, I agreed with the change.  First and foremost, it helps all spellcasting players below level 65 which is the most important subject of this change.  Most spend their time on this topic discussing 65+ gear, however.  I remember the dark days where Focus 3 items stopped working at all.  I expected my 65 gear would stop in much the same way.  This was a good change in my mind.  Others, however, felt sure that their high-end items would last forever (note: no item ever lasts forever.  One should always want to upgrade eventually.) and became quite horribly vexed when they learned they would eventually desire to upgrade.</p>

<p>The summit forums, where yours truly gets all manner of uberfruit tossed at him on a daily basis, was no exception to this.  In one of our dozens of heated messages I was called an uber / casual "flip flopper".  We will get back to this in a moment.  I spent much time considering this Foci situation.</p>

<p>What becomes clearer to me the more I test Omens and the more I think about Gates is that the two expansions seem to have come out in the wrong order.</p>

<p>Imagine if Omens came out four months ago with open zones, elemental level raid content, a lot of single-group content with equipment progression above LDON / Ornate, and most importantly level 70.  Those who finished Time and LDON raids head into the more difficult Omens content (more difficult because they have no Gates gear) while they level up to 70 and acquire that content.</p>

<p>Then Gates comes along.  The content is a lot harder.  Much more of the expansion is locked but even single-groupers have an easier time with the sewers and mountain trials.  Single group people are able to defeat the Ikkinz trials without raid gear.  The people who made it through Omens now hit that super-hard content (scaled for level 70 Omens gear) at Qvic and above and earn that super high quality loot.</p>

<p>Things seem a lot smoother in that obviously simplified theory.  There is a larger bridge between the single group hunters of LDON and the Planes to the single-group content in Gates.  The raiding guilds have smoother progression to the high-end raid content and the rewards for that gear fits their level better.</p>

<p>If you can't tell, I began to cave.  Perhaps being called a "flip flopper" finally did it.  I must have laughed for hours about the use of such a politically motivated word in a discussion about Massive Online Gaming.  I am a great fan of the use, reuse, and misuse of words as society changes.  George Orwell's 1946 essay Politics and the English Language shows how the word "Fascist" got so misused that it became all but meaningless back in the 40s.  Geoff Nunberg's Going Nucular (sic) talks about how the connotation of words like Plastic and Caucasian get horribly misused as our perceptions and politics change.  It wasn't until I was called a flip flopper that I really understood what they meant.  But I digress...</p>

<p>Very few people have high end Gates of Discord armor (don't scream yet, read on).  In a year or two, the flip flop of Gates and Omens (see, I used it again!) won't matter.  People will travel through the content in the most reasonable way, probably Omens to Gates.  For them, it makes little sense to have high-end Gates items, items that will be more difficult for them to acquire even at level 70 not work on spells up to level 70.</p>

<p>While I will not use my vast powers of the active voice ("Increase high-end Gates gear foci limits from 65 to 70"), I will say that it makes sense that high-end Gates gear scales to level 70.  More importantly, it will make more sense in a year when new players won't remember whether or not Gates came out before Omens.  In a year, with focus gear scaling to 70, Gates will be the clear line of equipment progression for raiders.  Without gear scaling to 70, the high-end Gates zones will see little use.</p>

<p>However, there is another side to this, a side that is not apparent yet to those who scream about their gear becoming "worthless".  If your foci gear scales to level 70, you will most likely not see equipment progression in Omens since your gear was really meant (in my own theory above) to be acquired after Omens.  You will spend your days tearing through raid content in Omens and in a month you will hit the high-end of Omens and realize there is nothing left.  Unlike everyone else, current high-end raiders will have already torn through Gates like a drag line in a strip mine and they will realize there is no more coal to mine.</p>

<p>Then they may quit and that is what SOE wishes to prevent.</p>

<p>Let me conclude this essay on semantics, politics, itemology, and marketing by saying that increasing the level limit to level 70 on high-end GoD items makes sense.  No other foci should get a free pass.  All other Foci from Time, the Elements, and any equipment in GoD with Time or Elemental effects should scale as the original plan intended.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: The Meaningless Words of Everquest</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">13 September 2004</p>

  
<p>Jargon plagues Everquest. We find meaningless words or phrases everywhere. Everyone has an idea, everyone has a complaint, and everyone has something about the game they want to talk about. Instead of finding ways to properly communicate what our problem is, we fall back to generalizations and buzzwords that may have meaning to us but lose that meaning the more they are used and misused. These words don't help us communicate with SOE. Instead of articulating a problem, they muddy the conversation and cloud the real problems.</p>

<p>Five terms in particular get used dozens of times each week on the various forums. These words add nothing to our conversations and don't help SOE find and fix the problems we gloss over. If we eliminate them from our vocabulary and speak in detail, we increase SOE's ability to respond. Lets take a look at these meaningless words:</p>

<p>Uber: The German word for Over describes high end characters, guilds, equipment, or abilities. We hear about uberguilds and ubermobs. We use the word as insult or praise when a friend acquires a new shiny item. Uber is anything more powerful than you. Some 65 paladins with 300 AA points don't consider themselves uber. Level 25 rangers tear through Crushbone like a tornado and everyone in the zone considers them uber. There is no specific use of the word that helps describe a particular state of the game, guilds, or players. In almost every Mobhunter article I wrote for my first three months, my editor, the uber wizard Azile Ciricbane, had to edit out my use of uberguild and told me to replace it with something more specific.</p>

<p>Casual: Casual is the most misunderstood and misused phrase in the Everquest community. There are casual guilds who raid the Elemental Planes. Some casual players have hundreds of AA points and play 40 hours a week. Everyone has a different definition of a casual gamer. Sometimes it means low level. Other times it means non-raiders. Instead of asking for changes for the casual gamer, we need to describe exactly what it is we desire. Do we need more short-duration events? Do we need less locked content? Do we need higher power equipment available to single LDON / Ornate equipped level 65 groups? Avoid the word casual, speak in detail.</p>

<p>Mudflation: This ancient term gets used any time someone sees the game progress and doesn't like it. Mudflation means little but has a built-in wrapper of negativity that lets us label progression like a package of spoiled meat. Few describe exactly what they mean when they use the term and fewer can describe how to fix it. The game gets larger. The high-end zones get higher. Level limits increase. Equipment grows in power. That isn't mudflation, that's progress.</p>

<p>Timesink: This is one of my favorites. Timesinks describe any action in Everquest that someone doesn't enjoy. Everquest is a timesink. Reading a book is a timesink. I know one perfect way to avoid timesinks. If you aren't enjoying what you do, do something else. Before you begin telling me that you HAVE to camp shards to get intoVex Thal or you HAVE to get your Ring of Scale faction up, remember that this entire game is voluntary and the world is big enough to find a million other and often more enjoyable things to do. If you find a particular event or hunt that bores you to tears, instead of labeling it a timesink, just tell SOE what you don't like about it. Speak in details, not overused and meaningless generalities.</p>

<p>Class Balance: Classes, by definition, cannot be balanced. Every class is good at some things and bad in others. There is no way to balance the wide variety of skills from one class to another. How does one compare the blasts of a wizard to the slows of a shaman to the healing of a cleric? With limited combat interaction it becomes difficult to make every one of the sixteen classes unique yet not required for a group. SOE can tweak class abilities and help support those unique roles. SOE can also tune encounters so they work well with particular class archetypes as they did with knights and the Ikkinz trials. There is never a clear solution for class balance and there is no conclusion. Classes cannot be balanced without ruining the unique skills that each class has to offer.</p>

<p>Every day players interact with SOE and every day players use these terms to gloss over deeper problems or recommendations. When you find yourself using one of these terms when writing a message board post or sending feedback, ask yourself what you are really saying and replace it with detail. Instead of asking for more casual-friendly content, ask for more single-group events that don't require raid gear. Instead of complaining about timesinks, ask for more Ring of Scale faction options. We love our meaningless terms but our communication becomes stronger and SOE's ability to respond becomes greater when we say exactly what we mean.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Omens of War Review</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">25 September 2004</p>

  
<p>Last week SOE released Everquest's eighth expansion in five years, Omens of War. There is no way to fully review an expansion after only one week, so consider this the first of at least two reviews of the expansion. In later weeks we will discuss whether the expansion filled in all of the gaps it intended to fill. For now we focus on what we know so far. Omens of War is a very strong expansion and well worth $30.</p>

<p>Omens includes a lot of new, useful, and fun zones to hunt in. There are eight over-land zones starting at level 45 and quickly reaching into level 65 and 70. There are three sets of instanced expeditions, the sewers, catacombs, and hollows. One locked zone awaits the arrival of big fancy people, and a set of Justice-like instanced group and raid trials await the corpses of level 70s.</p>

<p>The zones in this expansion look great. The wide open wastelands of the Wall of Slaughter stretch to the crushed walls of the Dragorn keeps. Ancient bridges cross the canyons of the Ruins of Dranik. All of these zones resemble lands at war, with scorched earth and skies of smoke.</p>

<p>Unlike Planes of Power, the better hunting zones of Omens are unlocked. The instanced expeditions guarentee that any player above 45 can find a place to earn good experience with little competition.</p>

<p>Omens has only one locked zone and none are expected to see it right away. Already we see treasures coming from the furthest reaches of the Muramite Provingrounds (sic) and Riftseeker's Sanctum. Flags prevented this sort of gold rush in Planes of Power and Gates of Discord, but the advantages of unflagged zones outweigh the disadvantages.</p>

<p>It is no surprise that characters began reaching level 70 two days after release. Characters have been at level 65 for a long time and not being at the top level seems unnatural. Many seek to reach that top end not because they want it but because they feel they deserve to have it.</p>

<p>More troubling is where they go to get it. Instead of joining five friends and exploring these new lands, fast-track hunters head to the Plane of Fire. Message threads string across the net with discussions of the Plane of Fire and the experience within. Some report waiting in lines to kite at the tables, the single best place to earn experience in the game. If ever a place needed to be modified to increase the risk vs reward, that is it.</p>

<p>The alternate advanced abilities in Omens appear far more useful than the ones we saw in Gates. Most continue the progression of previous AAs such as critical damage increases, healing increases, and stat increases. Some offer a lot of utility such as a ninth spell-gem and five more buff slots. For 25 AA points, one can up their mana regeneration cap from 15 to 20. Each class has a few unique and interesting abilities as well.</p>

<p>The shiny loot of Omens appears to fill in the power gap between level 65 single-group hunters and high-end professional raiders. We now reached a point where a character can level from 1 to 70, gear up with bazaar, Ornate, and LDON loot, and then earn gear in the high-end of Omens without ever needing to raid to get better gear. Raiding always offers greater rewards, as it should, but single-group progression now has a bridge deep into Gates of Discord and the high-end of Omens of War without requiring raiding.</p>

<p>The task system improved a lot since the early days of beta. Tasks break up into a set of four sub-tasks involving exploration of places best left alone, shady meetings with Wayfarer agents, collecting four shiny things, and killing ten evildoers. Tasks range from level 5 to level 65 with more tasks on the way in coming weeks. Their difficulty varies but I completed two or three different ones by myself at level 65, not bad for a weak and pasty cleric.</p>

<p>The greatest improvement to the task system is the scaling reward. While some classes solo much better than others, players earn rewards based on class. Clerics, paladins, and warriors who generally have more trouble hunting alone receive a higher reward than necromancers, bards, and wizards who can complete tasks much faster. The rewards of the task system make it useful without ruining the rewards of grouping. Triggered beasts and events locked for the triggering player would add a lot of excitement to the tasks. Perhaps that is a feature we will see later on.</p>

<p>The graphics in Omens are astounding. Detailed carvings and erosion on walls look good enough to run a hand over. Torchlight shines on the scaly skin of a Dragorn as it rushes down a hallway. Red eyes shine bright from the six eyes of a Chimera. Moonlight shines off of the water over the Abysmal Seas. Breath frosts out of the mouths of the hunters of Halas. Everquest's look improved much in the last five years and its visuals never cease to amaze me.</p>

<p>The lack of description and options for graphic performance makes these new graphics inconsistent from user to user. A new "advanced" tab in display options offers shadows, reflective waters, pixel shader 1.0, pixel shader 2.0, vertex shaders, reflective waters, and a few other options. It doesn't include Hardware TnL (don't ask me what it stands for) and Vsync, the option that tells the game not to run faster than your monitor can display. Vsync may be the most important feature to make Everquest look solid on faster machines and the only way to enable it is to put a "Vsync=1" variable under "Defaults" in one's eqclient.ini file.</p>

<p>Everquest needs a better interface for display settings with better auto-detection, a simple slider bar or check box for the features to enable. Most important are descriptions of what each feature does and what types of systems should enable it. Few people know what a pixel shader 2.0 is and no one should need to.</p>

<p>In the mean time, players must work hard to understand all of the available settings and figure out which they should use.</p>

<p>SOE released a lot of smaller features in Omens as well. The voice macro system lets tanks shout "Heal me, dolt!" when my eyes stray over to my Tivo too much. Guild tributes let officers donate junky gear so other members can have an extra point of mana regen. Custom titles ensure you can pick the title you liked the best. I always preferred Venerable to Exarch.</p>

<p>Omens is a great expansion. Excellent unflagged and unrestricted zones, new levels and AAs, new shiny loot for both single-group hunters and raiders, top-notch graphics, and a lot of fun new features make Omens one of the best Everquest expansions. It takes time to find all of the nooks and crannies in such a game, no one can write a complete review after only one week of play, but so far Omens is a lot of fun.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: After Omens</h2>

  <p class="entrydate">29 September 2004</p>

  
<p>Every new expansion changes the face of Everquest. Omens is no different. I had a conversation with a guild leader today who said he had great trouble bringing his guild together to defeat raid targets in Planes of Power. Their guild focuses on reaching the Plane of Time but each day he finds it more and more difficult to gather his forces. When I asked what they were doing instead, he said they hunted in Omens. I see little surprise there.</p>

<p>There seem to be two attitudes towards Omens. One all but ignores it and continues progression down the same path they followed two years ago. People seek the same flags, people hunt in the same experience zones, people all but completely avoid the new worlds.</p>

<p>The other takes the opposite approach. They seek to tear through all of the content in Omens as fast as possible. They hunt in the most lucrative experience zones in the game until they reach level 70 twenty hours later. They earn AAs and buy the best abilities as soon as they can. The random drops of spells and equipment hold them back, so instead they switch to Epic 1.5s. I remember being asked to help with all new epic raids within three days of entering the lands of Kuua.</p>

<p>A healthy balance exists between these two extremes. The world of Norrath changed with the opening of the portals of Discord. Powerful equipment becomes easier to acquire. We find new levels, spells, AAs, quests, and zones. We should seek out and learn more of these new paths. We should enjoy our journeys and adventures without feeling like someone pokes a spear in our back. The journey is more rewarding than the goal.</p>

<p>Most of the epic 1.5 quests have already been completed. The puzzle solvers worked day and night to solve the quests and epic 1.5 spoilers now sit on almost every class forum. I didn't receive my happy clicky stick until almost a year and a half after Kunark came out. I am in no hurry now. Instead, I'll pick short term goals and begin working on my quest when my own power and the power of my friends grows.</p>

<p>Spells in Omens so far prove difficult to obtain. All spells except teleports come from dropped runes. While the runes ensure that no class gets duplicate spells and all spell casting classes can use these runes, they drop perhaps half the time on rare mobs.</p>

<p>There are two things I would have liked to have seen with spells in Omens. I would like to see one spell given out at each level off of a vendor or a short quest. A single spell at each level gives players a bit more motivation to level than just new aas. I would also like to see a more progressive, less random, quest to receive new spells.</p>

<p>Again, I fall back to the point system in LDON. It took 11 adventures to receive a new spell but I knew I made progress with each successful adventure. I did not compete with my group to receive it; we all earned equal rewards for our adventures. Instead of only dropping muramite runes off of random rare mobs, why not drop pieces of runes randomly off of every mob. Collect 10 pieces, build yourself a rune.</p>

<p>Speaking of LDON, prepare for a flip flop. Four months ago I asked SOE to add new LDON equipment to the LDON vendors. At the time it would help non-raiders access more Gates content and give high-level LDON adventurers a few more trinkets to seek. I was told at the Summit that these items would be added. Later I was told they would be added, but not until after Omens.</p>

<p>At this point in the game, most of the "after Omens" fixes are obsolete. Like instancing the Plane of Time, new content overshadows the desire for such a large fix. If we want higher end items than the LDON vendors, we can go to one of three instanced expeditions and earn better loot. We can hunt named in the Wall of Slaughter and Ruins of Dranik. Like the gear in Kunark, Velious, and Luclin, LDON gear becomes obsolete with age. LDON equipment works well up to 65 but when one outgrows it, one should head head to Omens.</p>

<p>I could be a pain in the arse and demand that SOE follow through with new LDON loot. I know many high-end raiders will still demand a Time instance even though instanced zones in Gates and Omens offer better loot without any guild-based competition. Instead, SOE should focus their resources on the problems that matter most and the features that help the game grow further.</p>

<p>I'd rather see them work on new LDON-style adventures with new themes, new adventure types, new beasts, and new loot than rehash the loot on the adventures in which many people have already fought. Even if they did put focus 5 items on LDON vendors, I'd probably stay over in Omens for awhile.</p>

<p>I would prefer SOE look at the expeditions in Omens and add more LDON-like features to them than rebuild LDON. I would like to see an incremental quest for spells in addition to random drops. I would like to see a in-game goal and a two-hour duration for each expedition. I would like to see the removal of spawns so groups crawl from the beginning to the end. I would like to see boss-mobs spawn after the party kills a number of normal beasts.</p>

<p>Expeditions have a lot more potential than instanced group hunting content. Expeditions are controlled environments for the developers to build fun and interesting scripts. They use some of these scripts for the Muramite Proving Grounds trials, but few will see those powerful events and far fewer will survive them.</p>

<p>I asked for new LDON items and better LDON adventures, but now I would rather focus on the future. I would prefer to see Omens filling in the gaps left open with LDON. Omens includes enough content to keep almost any player busy for a long time regardless of the amount of time they play or the style of play they enjoy. A few changes to the expeditions would help bring the best parts of Lost Dungeons to new and more flexible expeditions. After that, all we must fear are the sharp teeth of the Dragorns and the green gasses of the umbrella people.</p>

  <h2 class="entrytitle">Mobhunter: Early October News</h2>

  <p class="entrydate"> 5 October 2004</p>

  
<p>This week we take a look at some of the news appearing throughout the Everquest community.</p>

<p>On Halloween SOE hosts the New Orleans Fan Faire.  SOE posted the  schedule for this year's Fan Faire last week.  Your favorite cleric (that's me in case you forgot) will be in attendance armed with an all new agenda to stuff into the pockets of anyone with an SOE badge.  Like the summit agenda, I will post this agenda here a week or two before the Fan Faire.</p>

<p>This week SOE announced SOE Worlds a print magazine devoted to Everquest, Everquest 2, Everquest Online Adventures, Star Wars Galaxies, and the rest of SOE's army of massive online games.  The magazine includes strategy articles, general reviews, fiction, and interviews.  I expected something like this to come out eventually; I'm surprised it took as long as it did.</p>

<p>The largest buzz and attention in the last couple of weeks appears to focus on Epic 1.5s.  Every class board, hundreds of discussions on the EQ Live forums, and most of the developer and community feedback follows the progression of these quests.  Epic raids pour into most chat channels and even the non-raiders seem to have epic fever.  Why people seem to be more interested in epics than levels, AAs, spells, or other gear seems beyond me.  It may be the most popular Omens feature for high-level players.</p>

<p>A bit of nastiness hit quite a few people last week.  People's Omens accounts shut off without warning and sent level 66+ players back to their level 65 self.  At first rumors spoke of credit transaction problems but reports came in from people who bought their copy in the store.  Sony jumped on it and posted this statement.  I heard of nearly half a dozen people losing their level in this manner but all of them seemed to get it back without too much of a hassle.  This seems to be the only major bug in an otherwise smooth expansion release; certainly smoother than Gates of Discord which suffered from random linkdeaths for nearly a week.</p>

<p>A new feature on test has bards cheering.  Bards will soon have the ability to auto-twist songs using a new "/melody" command.  Typing "/melody 1 2 3" will play each of the three songs in sequence.  The change helps bards become more social creatures, giving them the time to chat with friends and watch Tivo until their friends shout "Heal Me, Dolt!".  Some bard purists complain that it removes one of the great tests of skills for bards but most bards agree that the loss of challenge is worth the reduction in repetitive motion stress.</p>

<p>66+ spell costs dropped from 140,000 plat on the first few days to 60,000 plat today on Quellious.  I expect to see them drop to 10k before they meet the balance of supply and demand.  This should probably happen in a month or two.  I still know little about the location of 69 and 70 spells.  The no-drop requirement worries me.  Instead of living the twilight of my levels where I choose, I will probably have to hunt in Muramite Provingrounds and Riftseeker's in order to receive 69 and 70 spells.</p>

<p>People continue to migrate in long lines to the Wall of Slaughter.  Though better experience and loot awaits discovery in Ruined City of Dranik and its two sets of instances, people prefer the easier hunting ground and higher drop-rate of the Wall.  I cannot blame them and it is better to have one zone like the Wall than none at all, but it will be nice to see people spread out a bit more into the other lands.  In the mean time, for great fun and high adventure, travel to the Ruined City of Dranik through the Bloodfields.  If you are truly a band of hearty adventurers, attempt the Sewers and Catacombs expeditions.</p>

<p>One thing that definitely appears to be missing are random rare drops on normal mobs.  Instead of spending hours camping the same two spawn areas in the Hollows, I'd prefer to have a low chance (1/100) of receiving a rune drop or a loot item off of a normal beast.  Perhaps they haven't been found and reported yet, but so far I have seen none.</p>

<p>Expect a new system for the loading screens between zones.  People in beta had problems with the original one looking too much like a system hanging forever so they put in the loading screen.  The loading screen, however, breaks the flow of the game too much.  Sony builds a new system as we speak.  Perhaps we will see it in the mid-October patch.</p>

<p>I look with narrowed eyes to find problems for the single-group hunter in Omens and I find few.  Spell drops seem reasonable.  I received a piece of loot in a single-group battle I could immediately use, something that hasn't happened to me in a long while.  High level players can reach high level loot without required raiding.  We have so many useful zones that some excellent hunting areas like the Ruined City of Draniks sit empty.  Most of the problems I find and report are little more than nitpicks.  Overall I still give Omens a big thumbs-up.</p>
