<h1 class="title">Chapter 1: The Orc Scout</h1>

    <p>Darkness hung over the hills of eastern Tunaria. The orc scout marched across the grasslands, blood as clear in his mind as it was on his jagged blade. Above him, as silent as a fallen leaf, the young ranger watched and waited. Tarlin remembered his instructor's preaching. Patience and persistence.  Tarlin spent minutes silently shadowing the scout, making sure none of his ugly blue-skinned comrades were around.</p>

    <p>The orc grunted revealing yellow rotten teeth. No reply came and the orc marched onwards. Tarlin drew a barbed arrow from the quiver that hung comfortably at his side. Knocking it, he felt for the hilt of his Swift Blade, a reward by the Guardians for his travels and assistance in Krin. Feeling the reassurance of the cool leather-wrapped hilt, Tarlin drew back the string on his favorite weapon, his longbow. Though it was a crude weapon compared to the finely crafted bows he had seen on the merchants of Fayspires, his bow had fired two hundred arrows without ever missing a mark. It would not miss this time either.</p>

    <p>Tarlin took aim. His corded arms did not quiver under the powerful draw of the bow. He whispered three words of elvish and the tip of the arrow flared red. He fired. The arrow screamed through the air leaving a burning red trail of fire in its wake. The orc turned just in time to catch the exploding shaft in its thick shoulder. The beast howled in rage but was far from out of the fight. It rushed at the thin elf who caused him so much pain.</p>

    <p>Tarlin remained calm as the beast, twice his size, rushed at him blade held high. He drew and fired another arrow into the collarbone of the orc, but the scout was in a rage beyond any physical pain. Tarlin dropped his bow and drew his Quickblade. The orcs huge beheader cut down, preparing to sever the elf in half. Tarlin sidestepped the attack and kicked hard into the orcs groin. The orc bent over with the agony of the blow and Tarlin's sword cut deep into the orcs neck. The orc had one last swing in him, a massive sideways cut. Tarlin tried to dodge out of range but the tip of the four foot blade cut across his raw-hide armor and into his skin underneath. With the wild swing past, Tarlin stepped in and stabbed the Quickblade through the massive orc's chest and into its heart. With a final roar, the orc fell dead to the ground.</p>

    <p>Tarlin felt at the wound across his stomach. The thick hide armor took most of the blow leaving only a long scratch. A short rest and some tasty berries would help soothe the wound and Tarlin could begin his hunt again. There were many more orcs in these hills.</p>
