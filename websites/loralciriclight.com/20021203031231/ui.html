      <p>Note: This modification has been updated to work with the latest November patches. If you used a previous version, you will need to update with this latest version. Delete the "new" subdirectory in your uifiles directory and install with the instructions below.</p>

			<h2>Features</h2>
      <p>This user interface was designed for simplicity, function, and the excellent fantasy theme of <a href="http://home.attbi.com/~tomjking/">T-King</a>. The following changes were made to the default interface:</p>

      <ul>
			<li>Keyboard key labels added to group members and hotboxes.  Helps identify, remind, and teach hotkeys for both new and expert players</li>
        <li>Most window titles were removed.</li>

        <li>Removed many extra button controls. Learn use hotkeys or keyboard mappings. It is far faster.</li>

        <li>Percentage values for hitpoints, mana, target hps, group hps and AA exp. Thanks <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm41.showMessage?topicID=6.topic">Rombus</a>!</li>

        <li>Chat windows don't use fancy borders.</li>

        <li>T-King spellbook. Click bottom gem to close book. Click outer page borders to move forward or back. Click center of book to move around. Thanks to <a href="http://pub37.ezboard.com/fmaximus94788frm10.showMessage?topicID=74.topic">T.King</a> and <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31">Remelio</a>.</li>

        <li>Single player / target / group box. Extra player and target boxes removed. Can be toggled on and off with ALT-P. Removed extra player and target window (size 0).</li>

        <li>Labels for (from left to right) AC, ATT, Fatigue, XP and AAXP added to combined player window.</li>

        <li>Moved casting bar as a sub-bar of the mana bar on combined player window.</li>

        <li>Added pet bar under player health.</li>
				
				<li>Added T-King Arcane casting globe.</li>
				
				<li>Added streamlined bag interface.</li>

        <li>Removed % signs...in a few days you won't miss them. Saved 3000 pixels of space.</li>

        <li>New buff window with tiny icons and text descriptions on colored background. Thanks <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm41.showMessage?topicID=6.topic">Rombus</a>. Recommend that it is pushed up to the upper right hand corner and set with faded level 0 and normal level 50%. This will remove the rocky background and fade the buffs so they are visible but not too bright.</li>

        <li>Compass that is the same width as the hotbutton box. Thanks <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm41.showMessage?topicID=262.topic">Yaxa</a>!</li>

        <li>Fix to in-game books (trades, quest, etc) using the same spellbook rules. <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=22.topic">Thanks Remelio</a></li>

				<li>T-King Arcane Inventory window with bubble gauges.  It's big but pretty.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to install this mod:</h2>
			<p><a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=9.topic">Here are some better instructions</a></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click <a href="loral_ui.zip">this link</a>, click on "Save" and save it to your everquest/uifiles directory.</li>

        <li>Click on "My Computer", "C Drive", "Program Files", "Everquest" (if you have the trilogy, it's in "Sony"), and "uifiles".</li>

        <li>Create a new directory inside "uifiles" called "new"</li>

        <li>Extract all files from loral_ui.zip to the new directory.</li>

        <li>Check that inside the "new" subdirectory are about 18 files, most called EQUI_something.xml. If not repeat step 3.</li>

        <li>Start Everquest as you normally would.</li>

        <li>When inside the game world, type "/loadskin new 1". This should load up the new UI you created above.</li>

        <li>Move windows by clicking in their background or on their edges and place as accordingly. For an example of a good layout, see <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/images/loral_screen_layout.jpg">http://loralciriclight.com/images/loral_screen_layout.jpg</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p>This zip also contains my personal .ini files for screen settings, default keyboard maps and other initialization settings. Feel free to play with them or ignore them.</p>

      <h2>UI Setup Tips</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Remove textures from window backgrounds by clicking the window, clicking background and clicking texture.</li>

        <li>Make the background color black by clicking on the window, clicking background and clicking tint. Than click the black box.</li>

        <li>Set both normal and fade alpha to 50% for spells, hotboxes and group windows. Set chat to 70%. Set buffs to 0% for faded and 20% for normal. Stick buffs in the upper right corner.</li>

        <li>Use keyboard shortcuts to activate hotbuttons, spells, targeting group members and assisting.</li>

        <li>Learn all available "/" commands such as /tar, /assist, /cast 3, /book 2. Use groups of / commands in a social.</li>

        <li>Remember that the new UI isn't supposed to look pretty, it's supposed to make the game easier to play.</li>

        <li>On smaller resolution displays, 1024x768, put all your windows on the bottom and use /viewport 0 0 1024 525 to improve your framerate.</li>
      </ul>
