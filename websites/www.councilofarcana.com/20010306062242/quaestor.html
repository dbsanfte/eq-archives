    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <strong>Quaestorial
    Commission of 3182 </strong>was called by Arch Chancellor
    Kaelon Xerxentis from the Council's Headquarters in High City
    of Erudin in order to ascertain common misperceptions and
    questions regarding the nature, policy and procedure
    revolving around the Council of Arcana. Herein are questions
    asked and answered in the hand of the Arch Chancellor himself.
    Further questions for consideration to be added to the
    Quaestorial Commission may be </font><a

    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Q: What is the
        Council of Arcana?<br>
        A: </strong>The Council of Arcana is a guild in Norrath,
        the world of EverQuest, a massively-multiplayer, online
        role playing game developed by Verant Interactive,
        distributed by 989 Studios, and funded by Sony
        Corporation. It is located on the &quot;Quellious&quot;
        server.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Q: How many
        members does the Council of Arcana have?<br>
        A: </strong>The Council of Arcana's updated membership is
        available from its online </font><a href="ledger.html"><font
        size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Council Ledger</strong></font></a><font
        size="2" face="Verdana">. The Council of Arcana has
        members throughout all classes and skill levels, but is
        ultimately a single, exclusive and highly honorable
        association of friends and family.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Q: Who governs
        the Council of Arcana?<br>
        A: </strong>The Council of Arcana is led by the Arch
        Chancellor, currently Kaelon Xerxentis, a Wizard of
        Solusek Ro, from the High City of Erudin. Underneath the
        Arch Chancellor, who renders all final decisions
        regarding procedure and policy, is the High Council, an
        assembly of elders that oversee discipline, membership
        and activities of the guild. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Q: What is a
        Junior Councilor, Councilor and Senior Councilor?<br>
        A: </strong>Members in good standing of the Council of
        Arcana are grouped into three categories. Junior
        Councilors are members that have just joined the Council
        and are growing accustomed to the environment and the
        family about them. Councilors are veteran members of the
        Council, and recognized for their continued commitment.
        Senior Councilors have officer-like powers and have some
        minor, guild-keeping responsibilities, but do not serve
        on the High Council, nor do they make policy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Q: How does one
        join the Council of Arcana?<br>
        A: </strong>The Council of Arcana's membership system is
        exclusive, and adding new members follows a member-initiated
        invitation system. You cannot 'apply' to join the
        Council, you must be invited to join. When a Councilor,
        Senior Councilor, High Councilor or the Arch Chancellor
        sponsors a member, it is broadcast over guild chat so
        that any objections may be collected at that time. No
        objections withstanding, the candidate becomes a Junior
        Councilor and is inducted into our guild.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Q: Are there
        requirements for membership?<br>
        A: Yes. </strong>To remain a member in good standing, you
        must observe the </font><a href="honorcode.html"><font
        size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Code of Honour</strong></font></a><font
        size="2" face="Verdana"> and recognize the chain of
        command as specified in the </font><a href="charter.html"><font
        size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Prime Charter</strong></font></a><font
        size="2" face="Verdana">. Ultimately, members must strive
        to perfect, embody and exemplify the </font><a
        href="principles.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Principles
        of the Council</strong></font></a><font size="2"
        face="Verdana">. While the Council is a family of friends
        and comrades in adventure, it does not tolerate blatent
        behavior that misrepresents and has poor implications on
        the rest of the Council.</font></p>
