From the Arch Chancellor's Chambers</B><BR># Arch Chancellor Kaelon Xerxentis<BR>#############################################<P>Salutations, Fellow Councilors and Welcome to the First Issue of the Council Chronicle, the Official Journal of the Council of Arcana! The Council Chronicle is to be a weekly newsletter for our guild, consisting of the thoughts, commentaries, editorials and works of your fellow guildmates. I'd like to take a few moments to share my thoughts both about the Council Chronicle and the Council of Arcana as a whole as we begin to enter the first month of the summer.<P>The Council Chronicle is to be your newsletter, and is something that I've been hoping to work on for some time now. Each week, I will compile a listing of articles and submissions -- both from the message boards and any that you e-mail to chronicle@councilofarcana.com -- and produce an issue. The benefits of the Council Chronicle remain clear - while not all councilors visit our message boards, all guildmembers will receive the Council Chronicle newsletter via e-mail. Likewise, using our Digest subscription feature, other non-guildmembers will be able sign up to receive the Chronicle. And, of course, all contents of the Chronicle will consist of works submitted by guildmembers.<P>As I sit here in my chambers, I ponder the past ten months of the Council's existence, and I remain extremely amazed and proud of our many accomplishments. We have grown from a small group of shy yet ambitious adventurers into a community of spirited travelers and a family based upon principles and honor, who in spite of the size we continue to share the comradery, closeness, intimacy and friendship that has typified this organization based upon trust. <P>I'm really quite impressed, friends. For a while there, it was a bit touch-and-go. As I was speaking with Vice Chancellor Dunze Alighieri the other day, we both concurred that the first few days of the Council we struggled with how to determine our continued membership constitution -- at first, we accepted too many, then too few. Now, our membership, admissions and mentoring programs are some of the most rigorous and nurturing in existence. We have demonstrated that we are a community that is committed to developing our sense of family consistent with our values. At the hallmark of the guild is its degree of activity that brings our community together and establishes the sentiments of family and familiarity. Regular programming, guild events and reunions retain that sense of intimacy even in our growth. As we approach one hundred members, Senior Councilor Callaile Amanda said it best when she remarked that it doesn't feel as if we're that large, and conversely still feels as if we're a small, close family. This in itself is testimony to the success of our programs and policies.<P>In truth, we shall continue to remain a collective of close individuals, sharing in the common respect for our unique identities and individual objectives. The creation of the Guardian Council recognizes this maxim and encourages the pursuit of excellence. Likewise, the Council's organization has evolved to include ad hoc and standing committees that work to bring us the services and creatively exciting new events and ideas that compel our guild into union. <P>As we now enter the summer, we can expect renewed focus and sharpened objectives. The Council of Arcana is planning its invasion of the Planes of Hate and Fear, as it has already joined our friends and allies, the Lotus Cult, in the conquest of these two planes before. It is now our turn to take our historic place in leading Norrath to the occupation of the Planes, the overthrowing of the Gods and the Conquest of Kunark. Yet, of focus does not stop on the greatest of acquisitions of both prominence and prestige. We continue to hold workshoppes, seminars, discussions and guild events and raids focused at all level ranges, classes and faiths, staying true to our commitments. Indeed, the future continues to look ever brighter and more promising.<P>I remain sincerely proud and honored at the distinction of leading our great guild. As your Arch Chancellor, I have always viewed my role as the executor and enforcer of the Prime Charter, the defender of our Principles and the protector of our Honour, but ultimately, charged with the responsibility of ensuring that each and every one of us - as individuals and as the greatest institution in all of Norrath - have the opportunity to acquire our birthright and intended prosperity and glory. In conclusive assessment, I say, that the best has yet to come.<P>#############################################<BR># <B>2. Clarisse on Preparation</B><BR># Adjutant Clarisse<BR>#############################################<P><I>Originally posted 17 April 2000</I><BR>URL: <A HREF="http://www.councilofarcana.com/forum/Forum6/HTML/000019.html" TARGET=_blank>http://www.councilofarcana.com/forum/Forum6/HTML/000019.html</A> <P>No matter what level you are and no matter how many people come to help, nothing is successful unless you prepare in advance. Organization is the key to any guild raid or in this case corpse retrieval.<BR>I was in the king group at the time and the puller accidentally pulled 6 doggies (oops! Puller should be 45+ btw, not 39 because of a bad pathing bug). So after mezzing them all, I told the group to zone out since they took an awfully long time to kill one. It was then I got a /tell from DS.<P>One of the members of Dragon Syndicate (DS) reluctantly binded himself in the Efreeti Lord room (oops!). Thus, he could not gate out or teleport out. Instead of asking for a summon corpse, DS wanted to do it the old-fashioned way, get there by force. (Note: This is the cause of many, many trains sometimes.) Since I was the only enchanter at the time, I agreed to help them. Of course, I was a little hesitant when they asked me if I could mez an imp protector though. I've never grouped with so many lvl 50s since the Nagafen raid 2 days ago!<P>Anyways, with only one enchanter, it was going to be tough. From the first battle (2 lava bettles, 2 sonic bats, 1 ldc, and a greator kobold), I knew I was going to die. All of them attacked all the mobs at once leaving me helpless to mez. All enchanters know that if a mez is broken, the mob is very agro on you. However, the first battle was overcome by the sheer force of 5 lvl 50 necros that had pets. They should be only attacking one thing at a time, but oh well. It wasn't until the fifth battle when all @#$%$% broke loose. The monk was the puller and he accidentally pulled 5 imp protectors. These guys are a nasty bunch (conned red and yellow to me at lvl 45). Yet again, they fought them all at once. I still had to mez just in case they were attacking only one at a time. I mezzed one and started on another but it was broken instantly because a necro pet kept attacking it. The imp agroed on me and kept hitting me for 123 damage a shot until i died. Needless to say, when the enchanter dies, the healer who tried to help me dies next. Anyways, I've pondered this scenario after the tragic battle and I have gained new insight (yeah, wis buff!) on what I should have done differently. <P>Moral of this story is that with organization and preparation before going into battle, your party stands a good chance of surviving. Without it, there is a good chance you'll see "LOADING PLEASE WAIT.." appearing on your monitor.<P>Here are some notes: If a good enchanter is in your party, ask him/her for instructions. Always ask who the puller is and all melee classes should assist the puller. The group should define what order to fight first. For example, (Solusek kobold first, then shaman, then greater kobold, if all 3 are attacking. This helps the enchanter on what to mez) Someone should always be designated as the snare/root person. (If a mob escapes, especailly in SolB, expect a train) The cleric should normally tell the group when a person will be healed during intense battles (like I'll heal at 50% health, this gets rid of stupid messages like "heal me!"). If the mobs are tough, there should be a person with "evac" memmed but before that, the "evac" person MUST ask the party if anyone of them are KOS to druids! Also, when you are new to grouping with people, please trust them at first. I've seen clerics and druids run around in circles trying to evade mobs while the warriors have a hard time chasing after them to taunt them away. Stand your ground unless someone tells you to "zone". Say "Mob on me" so the party knows. In a good party, the warriors and enchanters will get the mob off you. Of course this all applies to groups, not soloists.<P>Happy adventuring!!!!<P><I>Adjutant Clarisse is an Adjutant to the Arch Chancellor and an Advisor to the High Council.</I><P>#############################################<BR># <B>3. Collron's Dicta: Mixed Tank/Caster Tactics</B><BR># Guardian Councilor Collron Dunmaghlas<BR>#############################################<P><I>Originally posted 10 May 2000</I><BR>URL: <A HREF="http://www.councilofarcana.com/forum/Forum6/HTML/000023.html" TARGET=_blank>http://www.councilofarcana.com/forum/Forum6/HTML/000023.html</A> <P>Greetings my fellow Guild mates! I am Collron Dunmaghlas, Warrior of the 42nd circle and a new member of the council. I am presenting for discussion a study that I have made of effective tactics for mixed caster/tank groups. I have arrived at this collection of ideas by distilling my experiances in hundreds of succesful and not so succesful battles in both good groups and bad. They are of course my opinions alone. Please feel free to agree, disagree, amend or ignore them as you see fit and feedback is ALWAYS welcome. With all that said I present!<P>Collron's Dicta<BR>A study of mixed caster/tank group tactics<BR>1) The Wait: <P>(a) When fighting in the open or above ground, party members should sit in such a manner as to provide 360-degree visual coverage of the surrounding area. One fully healed melee type party member should remain standing and move to intercept any random mobs that attack the party BEFORE they can strike a sitting or medding party member.<P>(b) When fighting in an enclosed area or a dungeon, party members should sit in such a manner that all approaches to the party are visually covered. One fully healed melee type party member should remain standing and move to intercept any random mobs that attack the party BEFORE they can strike a sitting or medding party member.<P>(c) When waiting for the pull keep inter-group communications short so that all party members see a pullers incoming mob message.<P>(d) While waiting for the pull all casters should keep your puller informed of mana status by calling mana levels every 20% until full mana. This allows a good puller to time and size the pulls to mana level of the group.<P>(e) If you need to be away from the keyboard for any reason be sure your puller is aware of this fact and acknowledges it BEFORE you leave the keyboard. Also inform the puller if any party member goes link dead, a puller is looking for mobs not reading screen messages. Make sure you make your tells to the puller visible by capitalizing or some other means to catch the pullers attention<P>(f) Prepare for the pull by creating an assist hot key. Always assist the puller using this key so that all party members are attacking the same mob. This is CRITICAL in groups with an enchanter and allows the enchanter to mesmerize all non-attacked mobs.<P>(G) As soon as the puller announces that targets are incoming to the group all party members should stand and prepare for the combat. This is the best time to cast short duration melee augmentation spells on any melee type party members. Casting this type of spell at this time maximizes the chance it will last an entire combat round.<P>2) The Pull<P>(a) The Puller should hot key an incoming mob message and use this key to inform the party of an incoming pull. Make the message distinctive so that it is not easily missed. It is possible to indicate the number of incoming mobs by the number of times the puller sends the incoming message. For example: sending the message INCOMING once displays this message on every ones screen in a single line. Sending the message INCOMING twice displays the message on two separate lines indicating a two-mob pull and so on.<P>(b) If the puller is a class that uses feign death (i.e. SK or Monk) DO NOT damage shield the puller. A damage shield negates the feign ability. If the puller is any other type of melee class a damage shield is a great way of helping the puller build agro to increase taunt effectiveness<P>(c) If during a pull the puller yells for an EVAC or ZONE do not hesitate. The party MUST either EVAC or ZONE immediately. A good puller will recognize an over pull and either keep it away or attempt to delay its reaching the party. It is much better to have a dead puller with a full party to help in corpse recovery than to stand and fight impossible odds.<P><BR>(d) The party must inform the puller if the party engages any mobs during the pull. This will allow a good puller to abort the pull and return to the party or kite any pulled mobs until such time the party is prepared to receive them. This is CRITICAL in enclosed or dungeon areas as the chance of a successful kite are nearly 0.<P>(e) Party Healers must be prepared to heal the puller quickly. A good idea is to pre-target the puller so that healing can be immediately performed as the puller reaches the group.<P><BR>3) The Fight:<P>(a) Allow the melee types in the group a few moments to hit and taunt the mob before casting ANY spells on it. This GREATLY improves the effectiveness of taunt.<P>(b) If a mob attacks you during the fight DO NOT run. Move to your tank and stand still while informing the tank that a mob is attacking you. A good tank will then target and taunt that mob off you. A tank cannot target and taunt effectively while chasing a caster/mob train. By standing still you also allow your group healer a chance to target and heal you effectively.<P><BR>(c) Do not cast your largest DD, AOE, DOT or other agro producing spell as a first attack, this makes it nearly impossible for a tank to taunt a mob off you. Wait until the mob has been hit awhile before burning it. The initial phase of the fight allows the tanks to increase the aggression of the mob and direct it at themselves. Once this is done feel free to burn the mob to the ground.<P>(d) If you run out of mana during a fight inform the party and begin medding immediately. You never need to ask permission to med during a fight, the mana you regain may save the day.<P>(e) The designated EVAC caster must maintain sufficient mana to cast TWO EVACs (We don't want to loose a party do to a fiz). And should inform the party when EVAC mana has been reached. Also the designated EVAC caster must maintain watch on all party members and their life bars, it is the EVAC casters responsibility to state that EVAC is being cast so that all party members can get within range. Also the EVAC caster must inform the tanks if he is attacked immediately. An attacked EVAC caster is death to a party.<P>(f) Healers inform your tanks that you will heal at 2 bubbles, this provides a decent safety margin and still allows the tanks the occasional crippling blow and strength enhance from berserker rage. In addition, it allows the tanks to build agro with the mob lessening the chance the mob will attack you when you cast healing.<P>(g) Any tank enhancing buffs should be placed on the tanks as mana is available. A tank produces damage over time that is unresistable by a mob. Anything a caster can do to improve this ability to produce damage over time such as the addition of damage shields, haste spells; mob debuffing or other spells simply increases the effectiveness of your party's tanks. Its also a good idea to stagger buff application so that all buffs do not decay at the same time, this allows more efficient use of available mana.<P>(h) Healers Heal, Nukers Nuke, DOTer's DOT, Tanks Melee! stick to your area of specialization. Its much more mana efficient to heal the party's tanks than to heal the entire party. Consider that the typical Wizard at 44th level will have around 1100 hp fully buffed, the typical tank at 41st level will have around 2056 hp fully buffed, as you can see the tank is the one better equipped to stand in and take it.<P>This study is a work in progress and the results of many hours of play and the help of to many fine players to mention. As the sole warrior in the CoA I want to place myself at the disposil of the membership for any questions, ideas or discussions about the use and utility of the tank classes. And in closing I'll quote the words of King Henery III: Qui non dat quod habet non accipit ille quod optat (He who gives not what he has takes not what he desires). Semper Fidelis.<P><I>Collron Dunmaghlas is the Guardian Councilor for Warriors in the Council of Arcana, and advises the High Council on warrior class issues.</I><P>#############################################<BR># <B>4. Kedge Keep Raid Review</B><BR># Guardian Councilor Dindayen Darkwood<BR>#############################################<P><I>Originally posted 20 May 2000</I><BR>URL: <A HREF="http://www.councilofarcana.com/forum/Forum2/HTML/000049.html" TARGET=_blank>http://www.councilofarcana.com/forum/Forum2/HTML/000049.html</A> <P>I'd like to say that I thought this raid went great and am honored to have organized it. We completed all of our objectives and went beyond what I expected. We killed 4 named mobs and tried for 3 others who weren't spawned.<P>We also had a low casualty rate for this kind of raid with there being only 2 death and one was to drowning. I think this has been one of our best raids ever and I am sure I will be going back to kedge again. Great job everyone!<P>P.S. I'd like to thank everyone who stayed after and helped me get the lock of hair. <P><I>Dindayen Darkwood is the Guardian Councilor for Rangers in the Council of Arcana, and advises the High Council on ranger class issues.

Politics and Power</B><BR># The High Council's Weekly Review<BR>#############################################<P>The High Council wishes to echo and reinforce the Arch Chancellor's address this past weekend in the Lake Rathe Arena's Rite of Ascension, understanding and appreciating the importance of recognizing meritorious performance and excellence among all members. The promotions and medals awarded are just some of the examples of the many good works being accomplished on a regular basis by all of our members, and we wish to send personal thanks to all in our community for their sustained efforts. The High Council also has a role to recognize the working order of its committees of review.<P>COMMITTEE ON FINANCE: Currently, there is an opening for the Senior Councilor of Review for the Committee on Finance. If you are interested in learning more about responsibilities, qualifications and election information, please visit the following URL: <A HREF="http://www.councilofarcana.com/forum/Forum8/HTML/000016.html" TARGET=_blank>http://www.councilofarcana.com/forum/Forum8/HTML/000016.html</A> <P>COMMITTEE ON GUILD EVENTS: The High Council wishes to congratulate the Committee on Guild Events for its spectacular guild raids on Kedge Keep, Kaesora and Castle Mistmoore in the past week. The surge of activity and reunions are formative instances in our community's development, and Senior Councilor Stefy Wefy has much of which to be proud in this commitment and these accomplishments. We look forward to seeing these types of events more frequently in the future.<P>COMMITTEE ON INTERNAL AFFAIRS: Internal Affairs has continued to handle issues of factions, internal relations, judicial affairs and most recently an attack upon the Council's membership by a most disrespectful person. Senior Councilor Tosin and his committee have ensured thoroughness and maintained the Council's commitment to open dialogue on these issues while being swift and sure on actions.<P>COMMITTEE ON MEMBERSHIP: Senior Councilor Tofewtoes remains an example of dedicated, reliable and regular work as he and his committee have tackled the high volume of applications while remaining true to the Council's spirit of exclusivity and selectivity. Likewise, the Committee on Membership have finished the first round of Mentorship periods through the Membership Reform Act's implementation and have produced well-informed and energetic guildmembers. We applaud the committee's efforts.<P>COMMITTEE ON NEWBIE EVENTS: Newly-appointed Senior Councilor Gabriale Stargazer and his Committee on Newbie Events held a widely successful event this past weekend that attracted the attention of our younger councilors and even some non-members. This event was a role-playing exercise that helped expand the imagination and generate the creativity that the High Council so greatly values. Congratulations on a job well done!<P>COMMISSIONS: The Kunark Expeditionary Force continues to map-out all sections of Kunark and provide a valuable resource for the Council of Arcana's continuing conquest of the continent. The Festival of Arcana has integrated its efforts with the Guild Events committee and hopes to be planned shortly.
