<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Through interaction and
    discourse, the Council of Arcana establishes certain stances
    towards individuals. Although the Council regards itself
    above petty, mundane issues such as guild wars and inter-guild
    relations, the High Council has made certain to vocalize its
    view of others - whether they be individuals or groups. They
    are identified below, cited for the reasons meriting their
    association with the Council.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#80FFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Warmly<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those viewed
    'warmly' by the Council enjoy the highest level of
    association with the Council while still retaining an
    individual identity separate from the Council of Arcana.</font></p>

        Immortal Vision, and through the spirit of comradery and
        partnership welcomes its members into the Council of
        Arcana extended family. Immortal Vision is a guild of
        extremely capable and honorable adventurers, whose
        commitment to adventure is rivaled only by their
        dedication to the principles of family and comradery.</font></p>

    cherish our way of life, respect our customs and traditions
    and honor our sacred principles.</font></p>
    <blockquote>

        </strong>Ebane helped found the Council of Arcana,
        establish its selectivity and exclusivity requirements
        and has remained an honorable and loyal friend, even
        after her departure from the guild. She aids those in
        need with no questions, and offers her friendship

        size="2" face="Verdana"><strong><br>
        </strong>Dragon's Bane Online Gaming Group (OGG) is an
        honorable guild of adventurers and companions, who take
        an active interest and share the Council of Arcana's
        focus on family. CoA and DB have a common interest in the
        protection and promotion of the Quellious Server
        Community, and we exemplify our friendship through an
        active partnership in adventure, social and community
        events.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Malrissa<br>
        </strong>A Founder of the Council of Arcana, Malrissa
        abdicated her position in the Council and left the Plane
        of Quellious in search of new opportunities elsewhere.
        While she will be missed by many, her decision is also
        respected, and her individuality asserted, she is viewed
        as a friend of the Council.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Sana<br>
        </strong>Offering advice and insight into the world of
        commerce of Norrath, Sana has on many occasions fought by
        the side of members of the Council and has also prevented
        members from making purchases which would otherwise be
        ludicrous.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Indifference<br>
    </strong>All citizens of Norrath outside of the Council of
    Arcana automatically are viewed indifferently. This is the
    standard faction to which members of the Council of Arcana
    posture themselves, but sometimes it may be to heighten a
    state of neutrality between the Council and another group.</font></p>
    <blockquote>

    </strong>For taking steps which hinder the Council of
    Arcana's progress or offending our way of life, these persons
    are viewed 'dubiously' by the Council.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Bermann<br>
        </strong>A kill-stealer that frequents South Karana.</font></p>

        A kill-stealer that frequents South Karana.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Xpoc</strong><br>
        A kill-stealer and former member who harassed Council
        officers and repeatedly showed lack of insight and
        immaturity in dealing with the civilizations of Norrath.
        It was later discovered that his involvement in Norrath
        has bordered on repeated nuisance, self-service and
        sacrificing others for his own personal gain. He was
        quickly ejected from the Council.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FF8080" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Threateningly<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Individuals who
    have done more than simply irritate the Council of Arcana,
    but seek conflict and vehemently oppose the Council of Arcana
    at every step are viewed upon as being Threatening. For the
    elimination of these persons, the Council usually offers a
    sincere reward.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Azair<br>
        </strong>Misled the Council on his intentions when he
        joined and tried to sabotage the guild. Intentionally
        engaged in disreputable conduct and commerce with other
        members of Norrath, he is not to be trusted and is a
        danger both to himself and anyone around him.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Kilios<br>
        </strong>An associate of Korianis (see below), his
        faction standing is through association and in assisting
        Korianis in carrying out his deeds.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Korianis<br>
        </strong>A former member of the Council, Korianis was
        ejected from the Council of Arcana after repeated acts of
        disrespect (such as kill-stealing). He then intentionally
        trained three founders and refused to return previously-looted
        body loot to its original owner. Since then, he has made
        repeated attempts to assault our message boards with
        profanity and has violated the privacy of members by
        sending unsolicited mass e-mails. He remains a danger to
        himself and those around him and should not be trusted.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Slapz<br>
        </strong>A loot-stealer, Slapz - most likely a secondary
        twink character - ninja-looted Sir Lucan, during a
        Council-sponsored raid. His direct assault against the
        guild caused him immediate faction readjustment, yet this
        alignment serves to warn others about the dangers of
        ninja-looters and how real a threat this truly is.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Scowlingly,
    Ready to Attack<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Council of
    Arcana does not engage in inter-guild conflicts. With this
    said, it is very improbable that individuals would be found
    on our 'scowlingly, ready to attack' list, but those that are
    can expect armed confrontation whenever before the Council
    and those that defend our way of life.</font></p>
