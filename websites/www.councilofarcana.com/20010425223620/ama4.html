    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 31: When a candidate
    has been inducted into the Council of Arcana with the rank of
    &quot;Junior Councilor&quot; or &quot;Initiate&quot;, a
    mandatory &quot;Service Period&quot; commences, during which
    time the Junior Councilor has provisional membership and
    abridged rights under the Prime Charter, consisting of access
    to Council of Arcana events, membership and activities for
    the duration of the Service Period.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 32: The Service Period
    shall consist of no more than thirty (30) days after
    induction, after which time if the Junior Councilor has not
    completed it satisfactorally, such a candidate be rejected
    from the guild, operating as if his or her application had
    been rejected by the Board of Admissions. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 33: The Service Period
    shall be administered by at least one (1) officer of the
    Council of Arcana, whose duty it shall be to supervise the
    process and progress of Junior Councilors under the Service
    Period, as well as coordinate with the sponsors of said new
    members to provide Junior Councilors with the confidence and
    services prerequisite to completion of the Service Period.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 34: In order to
    complete the Service Period, a Junior Councilor must
    individually plan and organize, although not necessarily
    lead, a social event AND an exploratory adventure with
    defined goals and objectives, or another activity as approved
    by the officer responsible for supervising the Service
    Period; these two events shall constitute &quot;the service
    activity&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 35: The service
    activity integral to the Service Period must have the
    attendance of at least ten (10) percent of the guild
    membership ranked &quot;Councilor&quot; or above, in that it
    benefits all participants equally, and be held so that it is
    accessible to a clear majority of the guild, being planned so
    that the activity is commensurate to the level of the Junior
    Councilor planning it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 36: The Service Period
    shall not be considered complete until, in addition to the
    planning of an activity, the Junior Councilor performs any
    and all tasks asked and/or required of him by either the
    supervising officer, the Board of Admissions, or the
    leadership of the Council of Arcana.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 37: Junior Councilors
    in their Service Periods may not benefit from commerce, gifts
    or excessive aid from other members of the Council of Arcana,
    and acts of 'twinking' or guilding of alternate characters
    are to be strictly prohibited. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 38: The Board of
    Admissions shall have the authority to unilaterally waive the
    Service Period requirement, if it is deemed that the spirit
    of the Service Period has been met by the Junior Councilor in
    question. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 39: The High Council
    may set forth an amended set of conditions or activities for
    a Junior Councilor to complete in satisfactory completion of
    the Service Period, which may or may not override the
    previous pre-requisite activities contained herein.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 40: Junior Councilors
    that satisfactorally complete the Service Period shall be
    promoted to the rank of &quot;Councilor&quot;, during which
    time, said member shall enjoy the following privileges and
    rights previously denied: (1) full protections and rights
    under the Prime Charter, (2) the right to vote in all Council
    of Arcana deliberations accessible to the General Assembly, (3)
    the right to sponsor candidates for membership in the Council
    of Arcana, (4) the right to sit in deliberation on the Board
    of Admissions, (5) the right to run for an office if it is
    called for election, or to be appointed, (5) the right to
    advance through the Council of Arcana hierarchy, (6) the
    right to be recognized through merit, and (7) any and all
    other rights and privileges so granted to a full member of
    the Council of Arcana in that the service period has
    concluded and the provisional membership has become temporal.</font></p>
