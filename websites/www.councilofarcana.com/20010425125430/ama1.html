<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 1: The purpose of the
    Admissions and Membership Act (&quot;AMA&quot;) is to set
    forth the rules, regulations and standard operating
    procedures for recruiting, promotions, demotions,
    suspensions, expulsions, and all matters having to do with
    membership, admissions, and the like, in a single,
    comprehensive, clear, and accessible document that can be
    used by all members, in both research and enforcements,
    arbitration and adjudication, prescription and adherence.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 2: The AMA is set forth
    by the High Council, as advised to it by the Ad Hoc Special
    Commission on Membership Reform, which it promulgated in the
    Year 3199, as authorized to it by the </font><a
    href="charter.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Prime
    Charter</strong></font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (pursuant
    to Seq. § Article III, Proclamation 19), and has been
    approved by the Arch Chancellor, in the Year 3202.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 3: The Council of
    Arcana shall consist of members that believe in the same
    things that the collective community of the guild does, and
    to this extent, adhere to and follow the Prime Charter, its
    principles and embodiment in the Code of Honor, and obey the
    hierarchy, while also contributing meaningful talents and
    ideas to the guild as a whole.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 4: Members should
    expect that the Council of Arcana will provide them with a
    supportive, large-scale community on EverQuest, with a wide
    range of classes and a specific focus on activities and
    geographic concentration, as guided by a well-supported guild
    leadership.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 5: Members should not
    expect the guild as a whole to provide services on a whim,
    including but not limited to, power-leveling, excessive or
    inappropriate resurrections, excessive or inappropriate
    teleportations, gift-giving, twinking, and/or any other such
    acts or services that unfairly deprive members of their time
    and resources disproportionate to the time and resources
    already committed by the requesting member.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 6: The Council of
    Arcana expects of its members to adhere to the hierarchy of
    the guild, remain respectful, honorable, and exemplary, as
    well as to represent the Council of Arcana both within and
    abroad by adhering to the principles and virtues embodied in
    all codes of law, organic charters, and edicts, of which it
    is the responsibility of each member to remain informed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 7: In establishing
    guidelines and policies for recruiting members, it shall be
    considered inorganic (that is, contrary to the will of the
    Prime Charter) for there to be any rules or guidelines that
    prohibit members from applying on the basis of their level,
    gender, class, or race. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 8: The guiding
    principles for recruiting members shall consist of: (1)
    introduction based upon social affinity and compatibility of
    the candidate with the general membership, (2) regular pre-membership
    interaction between the candidate and members of a wide range
    of experiences and diverse opinions in the Council of Arcana,
    and (3) definitive adventuring with members of the same level
    range so as to establish talents and ideas as the basis for
    effective membership.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 9: Merit and initiative
    shall be rewarded by the Council of Arcana through periodic
    recognition of said members with medallions, as nominated by
    their peers, and/or any other such form of recognition as the
    guild leadership may deem appropriate in each unique case or
    set of circumstances, repeated merit and initiative
    recognized by offering such members opportunities to
    undertake significant responsibilities of duty, service, and/or
    leadership.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 10: Each individual
    member of the Council of Arcana is an integral component of
    the Council of Arcana family collective, and as such, should
    contribute individualistic talents, ideas, skills, and
    concepts so as to enrich and define the collective, while at
    the same time remaining mindful that the welfare of the
    collective outweighs the welfare of the individual, so much
    as to the extent that it does not infringe upon the
    individual's rights and freedoms as established by the Prime
    Charter.</font></p>
