<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In 3179, on a cold winter's
    eve while most of Norrath suffered under the cruelty of
    Nature's Torment, the High Council of the Council of Arcana
    convened in secrecy in the Temple of Solusek Ro, near the
    Lavastorm Mountains. Therein, a pact between those present
    was sealed which established for all eternity the Principle
    of the Council -- a collection of principles and guiding
    notions about the Council's existence, its purpose and its
    ideology.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>PRINCIPLE OF
    ALIGNMENT<br>
    </strong>The Council of Arcana shall be dedicated to the
    promotion of Six Sacred Virtues -- Law, Order, Justice, Honor,
    Truth and Comradery. The Council also recognizes the eternal
    struggle between forces of benevolent and malevolent resolve.
    In this polarising affair, the Council elects to remain <u>neutral</u>
    and uninvolved, seeking instead to advance its own agenda
    through its membership - holding no prejudice or preference
    to those who subscribe to the forces of Light or Darkness.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>PRINCIPLE OF
    COMMUNITY<br>
    </strong>The Council of Arcana cherishes the notion of
    Comradery, and will strive to enable all of its members to be
    equal contributors and participants within its family,
    deriving no more nor less than what they contribute. The
    Community of the Council of Arcana must be one based upon
    Trust and Truth, and as such, all members shall have a vested
    interest in the operation and welfare of the guild, but
    ultimately, must work together to keep individual concerns
    alive amidst the chorus that is that of the collective.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>PRINCIPLE OF
    SOVEREIGNTY<br>
    </strong>The Council of Arcana shall be an order respectful
    of authority and venerable of sovereign power. As such, its
    membership shall acknowledge the seniority of its leadership,
    not question the decisions made in the interests of the guild
    welfare when appropriate, and work to defend, protect and
    honor the leadership of the Council. The internal
    mechanizations, administrative operation, and consequently,
    the generation of policy and procedure are strictly
    monopolized by the leadership.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>PRINCIPLE OF HONOUR<br>
    </strong>The Council of Arcana shall be a guild of honour,
    whose members conduct themselves with mutual respect and
    appreciation for themselves and for fellow creatures of
    Norrath. The Council shall not tolerate kill stealing or
    intentional, unprovoked player killing, and will take
    decisive actions as a community to discipline such
    infractions as well as fight vehemently against those who
    perform such acts against the Council's membership. The
    Council shall not engage in aggression unless first provoked
    or an issue of safety, sovereignty, or these principles is
    brought into question.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>PRINCIPLE OF
    STANDARDS<br>
    </strong>The Council of Arcana shall be an institution of
    capable, dedicated, competent persons who appreciate and
    contribute to the world of Magic, Arcana and Spellcasting.
    Its membership shall include persons without prejudice of
    gender, class, race or religion, with the one exception that
    all members take an Oath to uphold these Sacred Principles
    and fight to defend the Council of Arcana, its membership,
    leadership and the community as a whole.</font></p>
