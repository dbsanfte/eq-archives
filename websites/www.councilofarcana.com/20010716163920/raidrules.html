    Arcana is a higher level guild, and our members raid. A raid
    is not an experience group - a raid is a multiple group
    operation wherein everyone operates as a team in attaining an
    objective larger than any one individual. Raids are laborious
    and fun. They can also be laborious and hellish - so, prepare
    for them and use your common sense, and you may just survive
    any experience having at least grown closer to your
    guildmates amidst adversity. This seven-point plan is simple,
    direct, and uses common sense.</font></p>
