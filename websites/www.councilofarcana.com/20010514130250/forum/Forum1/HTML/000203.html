                  <B>Condition of the Council Address</B><BR>Arch Chancellor Kaelon Xerxentis<BR>5 May 2000<P>Friends and Fellow Councilors,<P>I issue this address this evening to commence on a new tradition and heightened responsibility for the Office of the Arch Chancellory and embark on a new era of communication. In the context of my role as guild leader and the Arch Chancellor of the Council of Arcana, I view my particular responsibility to uphold the principles and lofty ideals upon which our Council is based and ensure that the Council remains committed to the Sacred Virtues whcih are its providence. So in fulfilling what I hope will soon be a monthly tradition, allow me to report on the State of our great Guild.<P>The Condition of the Council is <B>stronger than it has ever been</B>. <P>Already, the Council of the Arcana has been hailed as one of the greatest guilds in the History of EverQuest. Its high ideals and increased selectivity and exclusivity for both its members as well as its external allies has proven to be its hallmark of greatness, and is a commitment which we must and shall never abandon. In this great time, we must not fail to live up to the opportunities and challenges before us. To this extent, I present in this address some important announcements and changes that will be of immediate concern and direction.<P>Because the Council of Arcana is perceived as one of the greatest guilds in EverQuest, we must continue in our tradition of excellence. Our policies of exclusively selecting and screening applicants and integrating them into our membership has reached a new stage -- the Membership Reform Act of 3184. Proposed by High Councilor Luciano Manente and myself, it promises to be the greatest proposal in our Council's History. Therefore, I am issuing a <B>call for acclamation</B> on its passage. If anyone objects to its passage, as of its final amendment posted in the Committee of Membership and the High Council, please inform me either here or at one of those posts. Through a call of acclamation, if no objections are received and if any objections received are resolved or retracted, then the act will pass. I hope to complete its passage and carry my Call for Acclamation by Sunday of this weekend.<P>With the Membership Reform Act's passage, we will be integrating numerous new services, foremost of which will be a "Mentorship Form", immediately below our Membership Form. Herein, Mentors and those that are mentored will have access to the forms necessary to fill out once their mentorship period is completed. Likewise, I will be working on a Mentor Handbook, and have a final copy of the Membership Reform Act of 3184 included both therein and in our Charter and Rules sections. <P>The Council Ledger will also be updated this weekend to include the most up-to-date information. I wish to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize to Aminos Feratu (and his alter-ego, Gixx) for excluding him from our listing -- he has been a pivotal and permanent member of our family, and this oversight is assuredly unintentional.<P>But our tradition of exclusivity and selectivity is nothing without committed involvement by our members. Senior Councilor Tofewtoes will be depending upon members to step up and offer their time to mentor newly admitted members. Please review the Membership Reform Act and be certain that you understand the minor commitments (although important and significant) required of a mentor and see how you can have an impact on our future members.<P>But a fair law and proper process must be equitable and cannot punish or pass prohibitions on our own members. The current Junior Councilors were denied the privilege of ascending to full-fledged Councilor status because of a Moratorium issued by the Office of the Arch Chancellory during the Membership Reform Act's debate and discussions. They have all proven themselves worthy of immediate consideration for promotion - and I will be reviewing individually all Junior Councilor files this weekend and issuing promotions for those that have fulfilled and embodied our Sacred Virtues and Principles of Honour, retroactively. 'Tis the only full justice that our council can have - and the Membership Reform Act must take in effect following its passage this weekend, not before.<P>In order to encourage participation by our members in the very heart of our Council -- the Committees -- they must be streamlined and assured their active, responsible leadership. I have accepted the resignation of Samare Imperium as head of the Committee on Finance (she wishes to step down to Senior Councilor General), and have decided to integrate all Financial powers into the High Council for its private dispensation. Committees will be able to seek funding for their activities through their weekly reports to the High Council which will, in turn, distribute and allocate the funds needed.<P>As the essence of our process here, the Senior Councilors of Review for our committees must resume responsible submission of reports on a weekly basis. I hope that all reports can be submitted by Friday at the latest. Of immediate impact, I will be directing the Committee on Guild Events to start planning for our events two weeks in advanced -- so that our events may be more regular and prepared. Senior Councilor Stefy has been highly committed to making this committee great, and can use all of the assistance that she possibly can. We should also welcome back High Councilor Leliel, who has returned to our family after a brief absence and formitive reflection.<P>Yet an ultimate organization must have a sound leadership and firm, responsible command. In part, the High Council must resume fulfilling its responsibilities and meet more regularly. To this extent, I have decided to share power with a <B>First Speaker</B>. The position of First Speaker will be held by a different High Councilor each month. It will be the responsibility of the First Speaker to call High Council meetings regularly and preside jointly, with me, over the High Council. I am appointing High Councilor Krawkowl to the post of First Speaker, and he shall begin the rotation -- with the next transfer of power occuring to his alphabetical cedant on the First Friday of each month. The order, thusly, would follow: Krawkowl, Leliel, Luciano Manente, Nibno Noreaster,                                               Toredell Ironica, Uzar, Cullyn Maelwaedd, Deadpoet and Dunze Alighieri. As the First Speaker will lead the High Council, so shall the First Speaker also have the power of Privy, and this advice shall always be weighed most considerably when the High Council is in session. Because this post of true power of presidency and procedure must be shared by our leaders, it shall therefore be rotated monthly among all members of the High Council, as aforementioned.<P>As we continue to travel into Kunark and explore the new worlds before us, our family is faced with a greater opportunity to demonstrate its unity dispite its spread locations. As a leader, I also have the responsibility to assure that there is always firm leadership over the Council of Arcana and that my voice is always heard. I have decided to appoint Dunze Alighieri as <B>Vice Chancellor</B>, a new position that I have created. The Vice Chancellor will serve as my voice and represent my will when I am not present. I feel strongly that Dunze Alighieri has embodied our virtues ideally, and that he represents the Council of Arcana's goals and ambitions justly and rightly.<P>It should also be noted, however, that the post of Vice Chancellor shall wield no executive power, and that Dunze's responsibilities are primarily those of a High Councilor -- he shall follow, like all of us, the direction set forth by the High Council, and join me in participating as an equal member of the High Council. Yet, his moral and spiritual presence must act as an inspiration and guiding principle for all of us, and I congratulate the Vice Chancellor on his ascension. As my lieutenant, Dunze will be a primary node to contact the executive authority of the Council, but as always, the ability to carry out decisions and enforce our policies remains firmly in my hands -- and the ability to formulate these policies remains in the hands of the High Council and its loyal Committees and Commissions. As Vice Chancellor, Dunze will assume the functions of Arch Chancellor whenever I am away on leave, or if I am incapacitated. Otherwise, whether or not I am present, I intend to retain full authority in guiding our guild and ensure that the High Council and its Committees retain the ability to govern it, but one must rest assured knowing that the guild rests on a process and a procedure that assures its stability and sustenance -- not on a single person. <P>In summary:<P>- I have called for a Call of Acclamation on the Membership Reform Act of 3184. Please share your final thoughts and join me in supporting it.<P>- Samare Imperium has stepped down as Senior Councilor of Review of Finance, and is now a Senior Councilor General.<P>- The Committee on Finance is being dissolved; all financial power and functions are exclusively in the hands of the High Council.<P>- We welcome back Leliel to the High Council after his absence; he remains an inspiration for us all.<P>- I have implemented a 'First Speaker' post in the High Council, to oversee HC affairs, meetings and legislative authority. It is to be rotated monthly among all HC members.<P>- I have created a 'Vice Chancellor' position to re-enforce the executive authority of our Council, and have appointed Dunze Alighieri to this honored position for his dedicated commitment to our Council.<P>- I have reaffirmed our commitment to exclusivity and dedication to selectivity in the Council as the hallmarks of our accomplishments; but friendship and community are the very foundations of our greatness.<P>Now, my final thoughts.<P>Our guild has a bold period before us. We face numerous challenges as we continue to grow strong and prominent. Already our members have become the strongest and most capable citizens of Norrath -- yet, we must never forget our commitment to community and our loyalty and friendship to one another. Titles and power, committees and commissions are meaningless if they do not have the community and comradery necessary to operate them. We are a guild of friends - a Council of Comrades, more than anything else. It has been through our friendship that we have learned from one another and joined in firm appreciation of our goals and responsibilities. <P>I have been deeply honoured and singularly privileged to lead this guild. I know that my leadership has been nothing more than an opportunity to let all of your voices be heard and participate in our democracy. I know that the gavel of authority I wield is derived from our membership, and it is to all of you that I owe responsibility and remain eternally committed. <P>Let there be no greater glory than the Friendship that we share, and let our unity be the firm indicator of this very Integrity.<P>For the Glory of the Council,<BR>Kaelon Xerxentis<BR>Arch Chancellor<BR>Council of Arcana<br clear="all">
