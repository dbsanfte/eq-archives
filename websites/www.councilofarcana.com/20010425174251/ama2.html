    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 11: Potential
    candidates for membership will first adventure with a wide
    range and diverse group of Council of Arcana members for an
    extended period of time prior to seeking the sponsorship of
    another member, ranked Councilor or higher.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 12: The Councilor that
    sponsors a candidate for membership shall assume the role of
    &quot;Sponsor&quot;, of his or her own volition in accordance
    with the pursuit of the type of member sought for the guild,
    and the said sponsor shall be charged with the duty and
    responsibility of introducing the candidate to other
    guildmembers, providing the candidate with opportunities to
    meet and adventure with other members within his or her
    leveling range, while also introducing the member to the
    rules, procedures, activities, and general concepts behind
    the guild itself.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 13: After both the
    candidate and the sponsor agree to move forward, an </font><a
    href="app.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>application
    for membership</strong></font></a><font size="2"
    face="Verdana"> may be completed and submitted for
    consideration, debate, discussion and approval of the Board
    of Admissions, a forum limited in access to only members
    ranked &quot;Councilor&quot; or higher.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 14: In order for a
    candidate to be accepted into the Council of Arcana, he or
    she must receive the support as voiced within the Board of
    Admissions, or provisionally in another oral or written form
    verifiable to an officer of the guild, of at least five (5)
    percent of the guild membership. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 15: If there are any
    objections or oppositions to the candidate's entry into the
    Council of Arcana, it shall require an additional five (5)
    percent of the guild membership to override said concerns, in
    the same fashion as in the aforementioned article, this
    process being repeated until all opposition is quelled.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 16: If the candidate
    fails to receive the pre-requisite support in the Board of
    Admissions for acceptance into the guild within a period not
    to exceed fourteen (14) days, then said applicant's petition
    for membership shall be rejected, and an officer of the guild
    shall inform the candidate of such a status, referring him or
    her to these articles for further guidance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 17: A first-time
    rejected candidate must wait a period of thirty (30) days
    before submitting a second application, during which time, he
    or she should re-evaluate objectives, goals, activities,
    priorities, and exposure to the Council of Arcana, if the
    intent for the candidate is to re-apply, and should seek the
    counsel of his or her sponsor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 18: Candidates for
    membership do not enjoy the rights or protections of the
    Prime Charter until they have been accepted in the
    aforementioned fashion, and properly inducted into the guild.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 19: Candidates that
    have had their applications accepted shall be inducted into
    the Council of Arcana with the rank of &quot;Junior Councilor&quot;,
    and/or &quot;Initiate&quot;, by an officer of the Council of
    Arcana, preferrably in the presence of a neutral witness, so
    that the Rite of Induction may be conducted, during which
    time the candidate must swear the Oath of Induction by
    publicly reaffirming said commitments.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 20: The Rite of
    Induction shall have an Oath of Induction, wherein the
    candidate is informed that the Board of Admissions of the
    Council of Arcana has approved his or her application, and
    asked if he or she accepts the judgment and invitation of his
    peers; this being accepted, the Oath of Induction is recited,
    compelling the member to swear fealty to the Council of
    Arcana's family, elders, and patrimonial patriarchy, as well
    as to adhere and exemplify the virtues, principles and codes
    of the guild.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Art. 21: Only upon public
    confirmation of the Oath of Induction shall an officer then
    conclude the Rite of Induction by seeking any final
    objections from the general assembly over guildchat; with no
    objections being found, the officer shall then induct the new
    member with the rank of Junior Councilor.</font></p>
