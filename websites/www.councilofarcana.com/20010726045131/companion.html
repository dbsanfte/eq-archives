<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Council of
    Arcana was founded on August 5, 1999, by a group of nine
    adventurers that are today mysteriously remembered as simply
    the &quot;Founders&quot;. The Founders convened on the gates
    to Kerra Isle in Toxxulia Forest and proclaimed a guild to be
    founded upon the principles of Law, Order, Justice, Truth,
    Honor and Comradery. These principles, called the
    &quot;Sacred Six Virtues&quot;, have been the guiding
    elements for all policy decisions of the Council. The
    resulting guild has been an association of players believing
    in the strength of chivalry and nobility in the power of
    community. Over the years, the Council of Arcana identity has
    evolved from a small collection of players into an elite
    league of family members dedicated to the same august
    crusade.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, the
    Council of Arcana is a leader on the Quellious Server.
    Councilors can be found in all of the most competitive
    dungeons and adventure hot-spots, spreading the same Sacred
    Six Virtues that were promulgated by the Founders years ago.
    As one of the largest guilds on the Quellious Server, the
    Council of Arcana also boasts one of the most comprehensive
    and easy-to-use web sites. Its guild web site, </font><a
    href="http://www.CouncilofArcana.com"><font size="2"
    face="Verdana"><strong>www.CouncilofArcana.com</strong></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana">, is updated automatically with all
    of the latest information and has numerous interactive areas.
    Highly selective and extremely competitive, the Council of
    Arcana offers the advantages of a large and skilled guild of
    extremely capable and gifted players, with the comforts of a
    small and tightly-knit family.</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Founders
    set forth an ancient document, </font><a
    href="http://www.councilofarcana.com/charter.html"><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>the Prime Charter</strong></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana">, to serve as the organic law and
    constitution for the Council of Arcana. In the Prime Charter,
    readers will find a short but clear piece of constitutional
    rules that set forth the basic organization and fundamental
    process for administration in the Council of Arcana. However,
    because most members of the Council of Arcana are busily
    playing, politics has taken a back seat to the sensibilities
    of gaming - yet, the organization of the guild is imbedded
    into the psyche and role playing persistent in the guild.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Guild is
    led by an <strong>Arch Chancellor</strong>, who serves as the
    chief executive officer of the Council of Arcana. Arch
    Chancellor Kaelon Xerxentis has been the only guild leader
    that the Council of Arcana has ever known. Wed to Allanna
    Xerxentis, who serves as <strong>Arch Chancelloress</strong>,
    the two take the definitive actions in the name of the guild
    and are mostly responsible for the administration of the
    guild itself. The <strong>High Council</strong> consists of
    High Councilors, the first tier of guild officers. These
    officers are responsible for jointly deciding policy. Senior
    Councilors, who do not sit on the High Council, have officer
    privileges, but serve as role models and community advocates
    and collaborate with High Councilors in dispensing with
    justice. The typical member is known simply as a <strong>Councilor</strong>,
    denoting the firm sense of equality and fraternity that all
    members in the guild enjoy. New members that have just joined
    serve as a <strong>Junior Councilor</strong> with abridged
    rights for an interim period.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Senior
    Councilors are elected by a vote of the membership -
    candidates are nominated by the High Council, and again
    confirmed by the High Council. The High Council can promote a
    Senior Councilor into the High Council when a seat opens up.
    For all intents and purposes, the High Council sets the
    political tone for the style and structure of the guild.
    Since April of 2001, the Council of Arcana has operated under
    a &quot;Common Sense Leadership&quot; agenda, which has
    prioritized decisive executive authority over structure and
    process. Councilors enjoy all privileges of membership,
    including voting, running for office, and participating in
    all guild activities and deliberations.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Membership in
    the Council of Arcana is through invitation only. Given this,
    however, players can still actively pursue to join the
    Council of Arcana in the most rational ways. Interested
    players will adventure frequently with other council members,
    be of the proper level range for the mean level of the
    Council of Arcana's activities, and subscribe to our beliefs
    and ideals. Speak to an officer and make sure that they are
    aware of your interest. Councilors will discuss in private
    prospective members and, if approved, candidates will be
    invited as provisional members for thirty (30) days, as a<strong>
    </strong>Junior Councilor. Upon invitation, Junior Councilors
    should do the following: (1) add themselves to the </font><a

    Councilors have abridged rights - they may not vote, run for

    Councilors have access to all of the activities and
    adventures that all other members enjoy, and thus, the
    distinction is often informal. Nonetheless, at the end of the
    thirty-day &quot;Interim Period&quot;, Junior Councilors will
    be brought up before a vote of the officers. Junior
    Councilors that have been active, dedicated, and exemplary in
    their membership will be promoted to the rank of Councilor
    and given full benefits and permanent membership. Those
    Junior Councilors that have been inactive, failed to
    contribute meaningfully or positively to guild activities, or
    committed some grave transgression, will be expelled from the
    guild at this point.</font></p>

    community or a fellow guild member are punishable by prompt
    expulsion from the Council of Arcana. Expelled members have
    the option to appeal their expulsion to the High Council, but
    unless otherwise informed, decisions of guildremovals are
    final. Members who are expelled - for failing the Interim
    Period, becoming inactive, or entering into opposition - may
    be re-invited to the guild at a later date.</font></p>

    Council of Arcana is not a typical guild - it has often been
    a case study in contradictions and exceptions to the rule.
    The Council is a large guild, but emphasizes intimacy and
    closeness amongst its members. The Council engages in
    competitive expeditions that result in tremendous victory and
    earning of treasure, but is a selfless and generous guild by
    nature. In the end, the Council of Arcana has believed
    strongly that the value of the community is enriched by the
    unique talents, skills and personality traits that each
    individual contributes to it. The pursuit for community has
    been the foundation for creating a civil society founded upon
    respect and operating using common sense. It remains this
    enduring spirit that has defined generations of council
    members, creating a legacy that shall forever be remembered.
    Welcome to the tapestry of adventure and to the ultimate
    experience in community building - Welcome to the Council of
    Arcana.</font></p>
