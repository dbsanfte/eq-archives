        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHEREAS the Council of
        Arcana is an institution and organization of like-minded
        individuals, supported and committed to our Sacred
        Virtues, the Principles of the Council, a Code of Honour
        and constituted through its Prime Charter, and; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHEREAS the Council of
        Arcana, as a guild of individuals, constituted
        exclusively of self-selected members through the
        consensus of the existing membership, should have a
        membership admissions and education policy consistent
        with its goals, objectives and the very same
        aforementioned principles to which it holds true, and; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHEREAS the current,
        undocumented and informal practices and policies provide
        for an often-confusing, inconsistent and contradictory
        method for the admission of members, and the approval of
        junior members to full-membership status, and; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHEREAS the High
        Council, as the Council of Arcana's final arbiter, and
        the Committee on Membership, as the High Council's
        advisory committee on membership affairs for the guild,
        both should collaborate to provide final clarity and
        permanent resolution on this issue, therefore; </font></p>

        follows: </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) Article II,
        Proclamation 7 to read &quot;For the first period of

        shall not be confirmed a full member of the guild until
        satisfactory completion of this study.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) Article II,
        Proclamation 8 to read &quot;Once Junior Councilors have
        demonstrated to full satisfaction their appreciation for
        arcana to the acceptance of an officer of the guild, and
        supported by the mentor, shall be granted full membership
        by said officer, with approval from the High Council
        exclusively, and thereby promoted to the rank of
        'Councilor'.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) Article V,
        Proclamation 28 to read &quot;In the case of chapters or
        committees being designated by the High Council for
        functional purposes, an individual may be appointed by
        the High Council, not a member of the High Council, but
        with guild officer authorities, to act as a 'Senior
        Councilor', with the authority to appoint and dismiss new
        Councilors within the locality and jurisdiction so
        specified without the overseeing and immediate
        deliberative review of the High Council, but will be
        required to submit an advisory and periodic report for
        final affirmation.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(4) Article V,
        Proclamation 29 to read &quot;The post of 'Senior
        Councilor', either in General or of Review over a
        specific committee, may be revoked by full consensus of
        the High Council, or be broad authorization from the Arch
        Chancellor.&quot; </font></p>

        Proclamation 30 to read &quot;In the formation of a new
        committee for the Council of Arcana, a committee mission
        statement must be prepared with specification of the
        local chapter/committee headquarters and the full name of
        its Senior Councilor, for the approval by the High
        Council.&quot;, and; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED
        that in recognition of necessary clarity that does not
        belong in the Prime Charter, but through the legislative
        documentation which forms the basis for action moreso
        than principle policy, the Council of Arcana AMEND the
        High By-Laws as follows: </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) The High By-Laws, in
        whole, are to be repealed, and the Arch Chancellor is
        directed to re-write them, and submit them through
        affirmation and declaration of the new Membership
        Policies contained herein, and; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED

        size="2" face="Verdana"> </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) The Board of
        Admissions will review the application and through
        consensus - in whatever way the High Council or the Arch
        Chancellor judges appropriate, validate the consensus
        through a vote, so that both the the majority of
        discussants and peers of the Councilor are satisfied with
        the applicant's petition to join, with no opposition from
        any member of the High Council. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) After a period of no

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(4) Should the candidate
        for membership be of Level 40 or higher, an alternate
        application method should apply, in that the sponsor must
        obtain the support of three (3) High Councilors within
        the Plane of Norrath, direct the applicant to submit a
        Class 2 Application form at the Council's web site, and
        then call upon the guild to unanimously accept the
        admittance of the new member. With no objections and the
        above pre-requisites met, the new candidate is
        immediately inducted into the Council of Arcana as a
        'Junior Councilor'.</font></p>
