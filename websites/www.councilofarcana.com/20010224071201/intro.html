    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>An
    Introduction to the Council of Arcana<br>
    </strong>Updated 20 February 2001</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>What is
    the Council of Arcana?<br>
    </strong>The Council of Arcana is an association of players
    on the Quellious Server of the popular massively-multiplayer
    online role playing game, EverQuest. While some guilds are
    formed for the specialized focus of experience-gathering or
    treasure-hunting, the Council of Arcana exists to promote a
    community based upon trust, respect and friendship. Thus, one
    can consider the Council of Arcana a true family of kind and
    caring players.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>What
    are the pre-requisites for membership?<br>
    </strong>Membership in the Council of Arcana is through
    invitation only. Potential members should be grouping and
    adventuring with current Council of Arcana members -- when
    the time is right, you will be invited and sponsored for
    membership. We always welcome new faces over our </font><a
    href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/bcouncilofarcana"><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>message forums</strong></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"> and encourage you to introduce
    yourself and be a part of our popular web site.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>What is
    expected of members?<br>
    </strong>Members are expected to follow a set of </font><a
    href="principles.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>principles</strong></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"> and guidelines that govern conduct
    and attitudes, as well as to conduct themselves in accordance
    with our </font><a href="honorcode.html"><font size="2"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Code of Honor</strong></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana">. Members should be kind, courteous,
    respectful and supportive of one another, and should keep in
    mind that the Council of Arcana is a family environment that
    is inappropriate for profane or adult-themed discussions over
    guildchat.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>What
    should members expect of the Council of Arcana?<br>
    </strong>Members of the Council of Arcana should expect to be
    part of one of the richest and oldest guilds on the Quellious
    Server, with a detailed history and reputation for excellence
    that is spotless. Members will find themselves welcomed and
    supported by their fellow members, and can rely upon their
    officers for guidance and counsel on all affairs -- likewise,
    members should take advantage of these resources by regularly
    being a part of the community and contributing to the
    collective what they derive. Formally, the Council of Arcana
    holds between two and four formal raids and guild-wide
    adventures per month - geared at satisfying the breadth of
    adventure for the average level of guildmembers. Informally,
    however, there are dozens of concurrent groupings and raids
    going on throughout the week - and members are encouraged to
    lead their own activities and involve their companions.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>What
    should members </strong><strong><u>not</u></strong><strong>
    expect of the Council?<br>
    </strong>Members should not expect the Council of Arcana to
    be a port/res/power-leveling/twinking service. While members
    are usually more than happy to help, please note that most
    members are usually involved in activities of their own and
    cannot drop everything at a moment's notice to assist members
    with matters of a relatively low priority. That being said,
    the Council does ensure that members requiring immediate
    assistance (e.g., a non-recoverable, about-to-expire corpse
    requires rescuing) do benefit from the loving and supportive
    community. And, more often than not, members can find one
    another to help with resurrections or teleports. Nonetheless,
    members should not expect this to be a given. Furthermore,
    members should not expect that being in the Council of Arcana
    will give them instantaneous group access. If no groups are
    available - there are usually good reasons for this, and we
    encourage you to start up your own group or adventure and
    involve others in your activities.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Who
    leads the Council of Arcana?<br>
    </strong>The Council of Arcana is structured as outlined in
    the timeless </font><a href="charter.html"><font size="2"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Prime Charter</strong></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana">, wherein sovereign power is vested
    in a collective of guild elders that are both experienced and
    active participants in the Council of Arcana family. The
    membership elects its advocates, Senior Councilors, who serve
    to convey their ideas to the higher echelons of leadership
    and support them in their pursuits. The High Council consists
    of both founders of the Council of Arcana as well as former
    Senior Councilors who are promoted through internal vote.
    Finally, the High Council is led by the First Speaker - a
    rotating position that all High Councilors share - and the
    Council leadership is presided by the Chancellory. Please
    examine the flow-chart below:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Description
    of Flow-Chart<br>
    </strong>The &quot;Line of Constituency&quot; refers to the
    democratic line of accountability and responsibility of each
    participant in the leadership of the Council of Arcana. The
    general membership elects Senior Councilors, which in turn
    are selected to make up the High Council, and finally, the
    High Council elects the Chancellory. The &quot;Line of
    Authority&quot; describes the type of power that each tier of
    authority wields -- the Chancellory sets the agenda, which in
    turn the High Council translates into policy initiatives, and
    the Senior Council and membership, in turn, openly enforce
    and follow. Finally, the &quot;Sphere of Activity&quot;
    describes the nature of interaction between tiers. Councilors
    and Senior Councilors &quot;consult&quot;, or exchange ideas
    and brainstorm. Senior Councilors and High Councilors
    translate these ideas into solutions and legislative results.
    Finally, the High Council and the Chancellory act in unison
    to carry out the executive decisions of the guild.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>This
    sounds pretty complicated. How much does this play into the
    Council?<br>
    </strong>While the Council of Arcana is formalistic and
    adheres to codes, rules and procedures that are honored in
    time and practice, these elements are ritualistic and
    secondary when it comes to the pursuit of fun and friendship
    in our family. The organization becomes necessary for the
    leadership of the guild and more often than not, the Council
    of Arcana's organization and hierarchy has been a source of
    strength and continuity for our guild's existence.</font></p>
