    <p align="center"><font color="#80FFFF" size="3"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Ranks of the Council</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Council of
    Arcana is, in the words of the Founders, a democratic union
    and open community that is exclusively and selectively
    founded. In the tradition of upholding the Council's hallmark
    of selectivity and defending the principles of family and
    community, each guild member has a specific role, office and
    purpose in fulfilling the dreams and high ambitions for the
    future. The </font><a href="charter.html"><font size="2"
    face="Verdana"><strong>Prime Charter</strong></font></a><font
    size="2" face="Verdana"> governs most political titles and
    posts, but their duties come from the common laws of
    convention and tradition. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Definitions</strong><br>
    A few definitions should be made clear about the types of
    power that are expressed in the Council of Arcana's political
    structure.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><strong>Edicts</strong> are declarations and assertions made by the Arch
    Chancellor, that instantly become law and cannot be
    challenged.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Proclamations</strong>
        are similar to edicts, but are expressed by several other
        officers of the Council and may be overridden by a two-thirds
        vote of the High Council.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Acts</strong> are pieces of legislation
        considered for implementation by the High Council, and
        when passed, they become binding documents that govern
        over the Council of Arcana's policies and procedures.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Veto</strong> can be evoked by to overrule an act
        by the High Council that passes with a simple majority,
        but can be overridden with a two-thirds affirmative vote.
        Acts that override vetoes become by definition
        'proclamations'.<br>
        <br>
        Recommendations are suggestions for explicit courses of
        action to be taken by the High Council that are issued by
        the committees or commissions at-large.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>Office
    of the Arch Chancellory</strong></font><font size="2"
    face="Verdana"><br>
    The Office of the Arch Chancellory is the executive authority
    of the Council of Arcana. Those who serve within the
    Chancellory are firm defenders of decisive action.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Arch
        Chancellor</strong><br>
        The Guild Leader and the formal head of the Council of
        Arcana, the Arch Chancellor's primary responsibility is
        to uphold and enforce the Prime Charter, defend the </font><a
        href="principles.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Principles
        of the Council</strong></font></a><font size="2"
        face="Verdana"> and maintain policy-driven </font><a
        href="honorcode.html"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Codes
        of Honour and Conduct</strong></font></a><font size="2"
        face="Verdana">. The Arch Chancellor's authority is
        supported by the advice of the High Council, yet the Arch
        Chancellor has the privilege to reign and rule through
        the power of Edict and Proclamation, and may veto acts of
        the High Council.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Vice Chancellor</strong><br>
        Proclamation 35 of the Prime Charter enables the Arch
        Chancellor to recognize a member of the High Council as
        his Vice Chancellor. The post of Vice Chancellor is
        purely ceremonial, but often advises the Arch Chancellor
        on affairs. When the Arch Chancellor is absent, the Vice
        Chancellor can speak on behalf of the Arch Chancellor. If
        incapacitated, the Vice Chancellor may assume the post of
        Arch Chancellor with the unanimous backing of the High
        Council until a new guild leader may be properly selected.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Adjutants of the Chancellory</strong><br>
        While this position carries neither organic (i.e., Prime
        Charter) recognition nor actual power, the Arch
        Chancellor may recognize any member of the Council as his
        personal advisor and empower an Adjutant of the
        Chancellory to be an officer and assist the Office of the
        Arch Chancellory with administrative or bureaucratic
        affairs.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>The
    High Council</strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    The official policy-making and legislative body that leads
    and directs the Council of Arcana is the High Council
    presided by the Arch Chancellor. Its members are recognized
    as the leaders and elders of the guild, and jointly, the High
    Council can act to pass proclamations by supreme majority (two-thirds)
    vote, and acts by majority vote.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>First
        Speaker</strong><br>
        All members of the High Council take turns, per
        Proclamation 36 of the Prime Charter, serving as co-chair
        of the High Council, for one month each. The First
        Speaker has the authority to veto an act of the High
        Council, set the agenda for all High Council meetings and
        issue proclamations on behalf of the High Council. The
        First Speaker jointly presides with the Arch Chancellor
        over meetings of the High Council.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>High Councilors</strong><br>
        Each member of the High Council is titled 'High
        Councilor', and has the privilege to speak before the
        High Council, summon others before the High Council, and
        call special sessions of the High Council for any purpose.
        Their privilege is eternal and they are sanctioned as the
        highest officers of the guild with the authority to vote
        and call for vetoes on any issue.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>The
    Guardian Council</strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    A purely advisory organ, the Guardian Council consists of the
    highest level per class guild members, regardless of rank.
    Jointly, the Guardian Council discusses class issues and
    class-specific quests and programming events. It is overseen
    directly by the High Council.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Guardian
        Councilor</strong><br>
        The standard title given to someone that serves on the
        Guardian Council is ironically enough, 'Guardian
        Councilor'. Members of the Guardian Council gain
        privileged access to the Guardian Council chambers and
        may singularly send messages to the High Council seeking
        a response in the form of recommendations.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>The
    Senior Council</strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    While not an organized unit of the guild, per se, the Senior
    Council consists of all other officers that have procedural
    and administrative duties (such as guilding and de-guilding
    members or hosting events), but no policy-making authority or
    responsibilities.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Senior
        Councilors General</strong><br>
        Officers that have no specific policy-making function or
        responsibility, but that are examples of excellence and
        dedicated commitment to the Council's principles and
        virtues, are titled 'Senior Councilor General', and enjoy
        full official rank and privilege.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Senior Councilors of Review</strong><br>
        Officers responsible for overseeing the functions and day-to-day
        operations of committees or commissions (see below) are
        titled 'Senior Councilor of Review'. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>The
    Committee System</strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    At the heart of the Council of Arcana's operations, where
    ideas are born and formulated, rests the Committee System -
    consisting of permanent standing committees and temporary,
    purpose-driven commissions. Each committee is led by a Senior
    Councilor of Review. Any member of the Council can serve on
    any and all committees, but should dedicate himself/herself
    to but a single one principally. All committees may submit
    weekly recommendations to the High Council requesting
    specific and immediate action.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Committee
        on Finance</strong><br>
        Responsible for fiscal maintenance and proposing
        fundraisers, as well as suggesting allocations of the
        treasury, the Committee on Finance can ask the High
        Council to issue acts of a monetary nature.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Committee on Guild Events</strong><br>
        The Committee on Guild Events oversees weekly guild-raids,
        community events and other guild gatherings. Participants
        should feel free to propose and organize their own events
        and receive public recognition for them.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Committee on Internal Affairs</strong><br>
        This committee oversees faction standings, internal
        policies and procedures, and may suggest any such
        alterations to the High Council in the form of a
        recommendation. The Internal Affairs Committee may also
        ask the High Council for specific judicial action in
        conflict resolution against a member.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Committee on Membership</strong><br>
        The Committee on Membership oversees the discussions and
        public votes on all membership applications, recommends
        mentoring program assignments and is actively involved in
        the growth and population of the guild. (Cf. </font><a

        face="Verdana">.)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Committee on Newbie Events</strong><br>
        Intended to be a sort of public relations committee (nb:
        the Council of Arcana does not typically engage in public
        alliances with other guilds or external entities and this
        is a privilege reserved exclusively to the High Council),
        the Newbie Events Committee plans events and activities
        for younger Councilors and non-aligned, lower-level
        adventurers of Norrath.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Verdana"><strong>General
    Assembly</strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    Members of the Council of Arcana that are not assigned to
    committees or are undergoing mentoring through trial
    membership, are grouped into what is commonly called the
    General Assembly. The Assembly's members have the privilege
    to participate in other guild events and committees and
    derive benefits of membership.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Councilor</strong><br>
        All members of the Council of Arcana, whether assigned to
        committees or not, enjoy the title of 'Councilor'.
        Councilors have the explicit right to vote in committees,
        be mentors in the mentoring program, sponsor others for
        membership and ascend to higher positions in the guild.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Junior Councilor</strong><br>
        Newly admitted members of the guild receive recognition
        as Junior Councilor, and enjoy all benefits of the guild
        membership except voting, being mentors, sponsoring
        others for membership or voting in committees. Junior
        Councilors are assigned a Councilor to be their mentor
        during trial membership. (Cf. Mentorship Program.)</font></p>
