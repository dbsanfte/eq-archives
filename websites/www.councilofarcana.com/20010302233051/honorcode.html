<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Council of Arcana is a
    guild which cherishes itself upon upholding the foundational
    virtues of Law, Order, Justice, Honor, Truth and Comradery.
    Above all, the culture of Honor stands out as an element by
    which members conduct themselves both in public and within
    the guild, and forms the overall basis for judging a person's
    actions and the content of their character. As such, the
    following <strong>Code of Honour</strong> operates as the
    rules of conduct for members. Persons found to be &quot;in
    breach of Honour&quot; can be expelled from the guild by the
    High Council.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>GENEROSITY AND
    CHARITY<br>
    </strong>All Council Members are to offer aid, advice,
    charity and generosity to the deserving, the proving, and the
    needy. Sharing of loot and booty is to be on an equitable and
    fair basis, without misleading or misguiding any team or
    party member, enabling the equal exchange of goods for their
    value. Trade and commerce are to be conducted with honesty,
    truth and no intention of deception or manipulation of the
    markets. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>COMBAT AGAINST A
    CITIZEN<br>
    </strong>Should a duel of mutual interest be engaged, Council
    members agree to fight the duel in honor and without
    manipulation. There shall be no other type of combat against
    another citizen, including player-killing, generating a train
    of monsters for intentional or malicious purpose, or engaging
    in acts which may unfairly cost someone else his or her life.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>KILL-STEALING<br>
    </strong>The Council of Arcana abhors the enormous, low and
    hateful dishonor of Kill-Stealing, and members are to
    actively lobby against such actions, never even considering
    to take these actions, whether out of own volition or in
    retalliation against another action taken against him or her.
    The resolution of kill-stealing should be wrought before a
    Game Master, and all incidents against members should be
    brought to the attention of officers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>RESPECT AND
    VENERATION<br>
    </strong>All members of the Council of Arcana shall respect
    one another, fellow citizens of Norrath, and the Game
    Masters, Guides, and other officials through which the World
    of EverQuest is made a fair place for opportunity and success.
    Any intentional disrespect, in this form, or any other form,
    represents the guild poorly and harms the collective as a
    whole. Discussions over guildchat should be of a friendly,
    open nature, encouraging mutual respect and recognition as
    well as encouragement and support for one another and each
    person's goals. While spirited debate is always encouraged,
    meaningful and intentional personal assault, bashing or
    verbal abuse against a person is strictly dishonorable.</font></p>
