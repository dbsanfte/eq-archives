I agree, SOME American's will say we didn't deserve this, some will say we didn't have this coming.<br>
<br>
NO country, deserves to have what happened in NYC happen to them.  To that, I'll defend forever.  In no way, was this even humanly acceptable...to target civilian targets, with ZERO military importance (that we know of at least) is completely inexcusable.  Those cowards, and the cowards that help them, deserve theirs.<br>
<br>
I just hope you realize that not all American's have just one simple mind set.  You are trying to make it that all of us believe the same thing, and that we are all to blame for being innocent and having clean hands.  You are wrong.  Some of us accept that we have been in the wrong.  So please, stop making generalizations that you have ZERO knowledge of.<br>
<br>
This country sticks its nose into too many world events, to that, I'll fully agree on.  But what if the US government didn't?  Things in the world would be a lot different.  I'm in NO WAY saying all that we've done, and said in world events were the right things... But sometimes, just having the balls to step up and act, and then take the heat is more noble than sitting back, taking no action, hoping that things will turn out peachey and creamy.<br>
<br>
So back to Sash's sad Somali example...what about the rest of the world that ignored what was going on there?  Many, many nations had the ability to step in and help those being repressed/tortured/starved.  But did nothing.  Inaction...the pussy way out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujaeron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 364<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/02 7:56 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venting.</span><hr size=1> Okay the thread is too long.  I read enough of it though to come up with my opinion.  Its a very good thing there is such a balance of people in this country.. the ones who see everything we do as right, and the ones who see everything we do as wrong.  If there were too many who thought everything was right, we'd do things that were outright blatantly in your face wrong, just because we can.  If too many thought everything was wrong, the country would fall apart.  Key thing to remember here is, the US is a business.  We will make decisions both economical and in the name of our safety that people will like, and won't like.  Personally I'm glad that things are the way they are.  We dropped those atomic bombs to test the true damage they could cause, and to beat the world into submission.  How were we to know other countries would eventually gain the same abilities due to corrupt people selling secrets etc..   I'm okay with this because I like my way of life.  If you don't like your way of life, get out.. go somewhere that suits your lifestyle better.  As far as the idea that America is ignorant for not knowing who the Prime Minister of Canada is, and where Bulgaria is on a map, it depends on who you're talking about.  I would hardly consider someone who went to school for 12 years to become a surgeon ignorant, but there's a good chance they don't know who the Prime Minister of Canada is.  Why?  Well pretty much because.. who gives a crap?  Sorry to tell you, but people know who the President of the US is because its a super power.  Canada?  Um.. beautiful country, not bashing it, but why would I care who the leader is?  Do you know who runs Belize?  How about Peru?  Argentina?  Can you name me the leader of every country in the world?  I doubt it.. so before you bash Americans for not knowing the leader of Canada, make sure you can name the leader of EVERY country in the world without looking it up on the internet.  Why?  Because Canadas leadership is about as important of knowledge to me as the rest of the worlds.  (And I say rest, meaning the entire worlds.. I would only know Canadas leadership figurehead if I knew the entire worlds leadership figurehead.  Which I don't, which you don't.  I know the countries that I need to know.) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

<br>
Warcrimes are not necessarily measured by numbers, they are also measured by severity among other criteria. We cannot condone what the Nazi's did to the Jews in WWII but we also cannot condone what the Jews are doing to others.<br>
<br>
In september 1982 in Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon within 24 hours , Ariel Sharon surpervised the killing of 3200 Palestinian men, women and children. Women were gutted , some were pregnant and their foetus' were left on the ground as israeli soldeirs took pictures of their achievements. This was recognised by the War Crimes tribunal and Ariel Sharon was set to stand trial but guess who interfered... Big brother Captain America told the Tribunal to stfu and not pursue it anymore and surprise surprise , it was never brought up again. The weapons used to carry out this grosse mass execution were supplied by....you guessed it, America. <br>
<br>
As well as Sabra and Shatlia to this day there are horrendous war crimes being commited still by Ariel Sharon and his band of filth in various torture camps scattered across Israel for example the Khiam Prison where men, women and children were often beaten so bad they lost the use of limbs or had become blind or lost the use of their genitels. The Israeli troops would often handcuff Palestinian prisoners to poles and splash freezing water on them day and night, then attach electrodes to their bodies and electricute them. All supported by America and American equipment. There is proof of this and real footage caught on tape by outside reporters who risked their lives for it. So dont you dare try and tell me they havent committed some of the worst War Crimes Wenin, you dont know enough to make that statement.<br>
<br>
if you want to see proof of this go visit a good source www.inminds.com , this will show you proof of the torture camps currently still operating in Israel which have American backing.<br>

Actually we were aware that other countries were conducting experiments that were leading them to the development of the &quot;bomb&quot;.  Germany if not defeated, were well on their way.  Isn't it true that the way that Russia got into the race, was from German scientists (besides the reports of them having gathered intelligence on our own projects)?<br>

To put it in simple forms, imagine math wasn't as taken for granted as it is, and someone figured out that if you add 10 and 10, you get 20.. but doesn't explain how that works.. (If you take 10 bananas, and add 10 bananas, then count them all together, you end up with 20 bananas)  Yes that was easy to come to the conclusion of, but now exchange that math problem with something as difficult as figuring out how to space travel, and atomic energy science etc.. and I doubt that the same conclusions were made by the same scientific discoveries, and not just someone selling information.

If the Iraqi government cared for its people, they would have allowed the weapon inspects 8 years ago to have gone unhindered.  The sanctions that are in place because of their surrender and lack of following through with the surrender terms have placed that country where it is today.<br>

HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHA...Leth please say you were wrong on this one :P I belive wenin already pointed out the numbers....There was not even one million casueties in the whole fucking war.<br>
<br>
Depleated uranium gun shells...Are used because of thier high density to impact tanks...They would not be used in a city we would have used a bomb if striking a military target near a city. Also I am not even sure the shells are radioactive...They are handled by weapons loaders ALL the time. <br>
<br>
Thanks Dumai for doing the research on nagasaki/hiroshima I just didn't feel like it...Merton if we had gotten pamhlets telling us WTC was going to be bombed AND WTC was a training ground for troops lets say in the basement...Then yes those that were lost in the WTC would have been a loss of war. Of course they were just people trying to feed thier fucking families.<br>
<br>
Leth you call americans ignorant yet you truly no nothing about what happened in the world. Do you know why veitnam/middle east is so fucked up? European Imperialism...After britain Pulled out of many of theses areas it left gaps of power and then all hell broke loose. The U.S. for years has been trying to stabilize it any way we can and many times weve just fucked up.<br>
<br>
However we are simply trying to clean up after other countries, and you paint us the bad guy...You throw numbers out there like 1 million children and make yourself look like a complete jack off. I respect others opinions hell even mertons...However where the fuck did you come up with 1 million....FFS the war only last 48 hours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/upyrezipyromaniac.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyre ZiPyromaniac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/02 9:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Lethys, I can't believe the utter stupidity in your posts, and how fucking stupid you really are.

And, and lets cry foul about how Israel treats there prisoners, lets not forget it's the same men, women, and children that they so called torture that strap bombs to themselves and kill hundreds of Israel civilians. And last time i checked i didn't see no american there giving the orders to carry out these so called tortures.<br>

Don't worry Lethys, i guess i would be upset to if some phesants that were barely trained in the art of warfare kicked the shit out of my country with mere pitchforks and some nice frenchy troops  givin some nice well timed support as your dictatorship tried to flee like the pansies they really were.<br>

There is someone in this thread that did a personal account of what they saw in Somalia.  Also those soldiers that were in Somalia and seen the movie, said that it portrayed what happened accurately.  Though, thankfully the movie had little to no political rhetoric.  The movie was practically a documentary reinactment of what happened. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucharismah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Charismah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/02 11:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> I'll forthrightly admit that I've only read the first 2 pages of this thread, so what I say may have been earlier stated.  If that's the case, I apologize.<br>
<br>
I am a housewife and stay-at-home Mom (well, M-F anyway), who lives in rural America.  The neighborhood I live in takes up more then half of my entire towns' population.  I think it can be classified as 'small town'.  I'll also say that I'm not horribly astute on all of our politics as to what happened when and why.  However, I am quite intelligent, and I do have a mind of my own.<br>
<br>
America is more then a country.  It is also an idealism.  What we are and what we do may change with every presidency, but our basic standards remain intact.  This is a country where it is encouraged to speak your mind, and encouraged to 'debate' sides.  Everyone does it with every election, and many times in between.  We do NOT all think alike.  We are not all one person, or one mind.  If that were the case, we wouldn't have democrats and republicans and independents - much less factions within each of those parties.<br>
<br>
I think it was Sash who stated (and if I'm wrong, please accept my apology now) that there were some who believed they were voting for former Pres Bush (Daddy).  I'm not going to say that's not possible.  But it does make me laugh.  LOL )  It also makes me think of the people (I wanted to insert a derrogatory name here, but chose not to) in a certain state who couldn't even vote properly.  For a long time, I've believed everyone should have to take a test before each election if they wanted to vote.  Just a test to make sure they knew what it was each candidate stood for - not one to make sure everyone voted alike.  It just makes me really sick when I go to vote, and people are actually handing out cards on how to fill your ballot out (who to vote for) so that the people *they* want elected can win.  Now at this - I would then agree that these people do NOT have minds of their own.  Anyhow, with that other drama, I am beginning to think we should also be tested on how to fill out the ballots.  Are all Americans classified with genius IQs?  No.  Do we all make dumb mistakes?  Unfortunately, yes.  Each and every Presidency has - and each one in the future will.  Please don't judge us because you read something about a few of us.  That is unfair.  If you really want to get to know us, then come here and visit in several areas for an extended period of time before you make that kind of judgement, please.  This is an AWESOME country and I'm proud to be a part of it.  If you or anyone else has issues with it, please keep them to yourself.  I can't say I'd come in here and degrade your country and tell you what horrible and stupid people you lived near and were countrymen with.  And I don't care if you DO live in Afghanistan or Iraq.  <br>
<br>
To the men and women who serve our country.  I'm proud of you!  I can't say enough about you.  You and those who came before you are the reason for 'America'.  Thank you!  You serve to protect us as I serve to protect my son.  When I think of it that way, I can do nothing but stand in awe that you would offer your life and your commitment to us - whom you don't even know.  Keep American ideals alive.  Follow your orders to serve your country.  No matter where you go or what you do, I will always back you.  I do trust enough to believe that all consequences were weighed before you ever received those orders.  Call me niave (those who disagree), if you will....<br>
<br>
I guess this was my beef.  Many innocent lives were lost 9/11/01.  It was an attack on civilians that never should have happened.  Note that I didn't say it was an attack where innocent civilians died - it was an attack *on them* in particular.  War is war, but this wasn't war.  This was terrorism - no matter how you may choose to justify it.  I only hope you never have to feel such effects on your lives and the lives of your loved ones. <p><BR><BR>

Amen. to the American president, America comes first. seems simple enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Think of all the ways in which America influences the world in a given day. Now think of all the ways they do so within a given year, or for that matter century. Then, realize that all of the Anti-Americanism going on here is pretty much just rehashing 3 points over and over again (Vietnam, Middle East Policy and the nukes on Japan).<br>
<br>
Nuking Hiroshima was bad? No shit, but in Japan's attacking us AND their refusal to surrender, we were left with the choices of killing a bunch of Japanese civilians, or killing a bunch of Japanese, civilians undoubtedly making up a massive portion as we would have been forced to physically invade the cities, and sustain massive American casualties along the way. <br>
Hate to break it to you, but in American policy, especially in war, America's interest comes first. We had an opportunity to prevent what might have gone upward of a million American casualties, and took it. To this day, I'll stand by that action and be fucking proud that I'm an American even in light of it.<br>
<br>
We did some things that in hindsight we shouldn't have done. We also did some things of which we were not certain that, in hindsight, were absolutely necessary and helped make the world such a better place. Anyone that argues we've done remotely as much harm to the world as we have good is just fucking retarded. If you'd say so it's because you're fucking blindly bigoted... which is exactly what you accuse us of being. Pretty fucking ironic.<br>
