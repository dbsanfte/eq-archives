&quot;Ectogenesis&quot; may change the abortion debate<br>
Fetal Position by Sacha Zimmerman (from The New Republic)<br>
The real threat to Roe v. Wade.<br>
<br>
Back in January, the abortion rights group naral Pro-Choice America held a dinner in Washington to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. But the event was far from celebratory, with speaker after speaker warning that a woman's right to choose was in grave danger. &quot;For the first time since Roe v. Wade, anti-choice politicians control the presidency and both <br>
houses of Congress,&quot; naral Pro-Choice America President Kate <br>
Michelman warned in a typical speech. &quot;The Supreme Court is one vote away from dismantling the right to choose.&quot; At a rally the next day, the group's legal director, Elizabeth Cavendish, declared, &quot;A woman's right to choose is imperiled.&quot;<br>
<br>
But, however serious the political threat to Roe, Michelman and Cavendish are missing a technological threat that could be greater still: ectogenesis. Better known as the artificial womb, ectogenesis is the process by which a fetus gestates in an environment external to the mother. And, while it may sound like the stuff of science fiction--evoking images of the &quot;decanted infants&quot; in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World--researchers estimate that ectogenesis could be a reality within five years. <br>
<br>
If and when that happens, the legal and philosophical premises underpinning Roe could be completely dismantled. Which is why some pro-lifers are eagerly awaiting that day. And why it is so surprising that pro-choice activists appear to have given little or no thought to the brave new world that could be right around the corner.<br>
<br>
Ectogenesis is close to becoming a reality because scientists are steadily advancing reproductive technology at both ends of gestation. At one end, to help women who are having difficulty conceiving or who have defective wombs, Cornell University's Dr. Hung-Ching Liu has taken steps toward developing an artificial womb by removing cells from the lining of a woman's womb and then, using hormones, growing layers of these cells on a model of a uterus. The model eventually dissolves, leaving a new, artificial womb that continues to thrive. What's more, Liu's team found that, within days <br>
of being placed in the new womb, embryos will attach themselves to its walls and begin to grow. At that point, scientists must end the experiment to comply with in-vitro fertilization (IVF) laws, so researchers do not yet know how long after the beginning stages of gestation this artificial womb would be viable. <br>
<br>
But Liu has said she hopes to &quot;create complete artificial wombs using these techniques in a few years&quot;--although, given current IVF and stem-cell laws, it is not yet clear whether she will be able to continue her work in the United States.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, at the other end of gestation, Temple University's Dr. Thomas Schaffer is trying to save premature babies by using a synthetic amniotic fluid. He developed a breathable liquid made of perfluorocarbons--liquids that carry more oxygen than air--and has successfully tested the fluid on premature lamb fetuses not yet capable of breathing air. Schaffer says that the only reason he isn't using the technique on human beings right now is a lack of funding. &quot;We have babies that are six hundred grams [21.9 ounces], <br>
born on a toilet, brought to a nicu [neonatal intensive care unit], and survive,&quot; he says. &quot;Now [with perfluorocarbons] we can take care of these children.&quot;<br>
<br>
In Japan, Dr. Yoshinori Kuwabara, a professor of obstetrics at <br>
Juntendo University, has actually created an artificial womb, using an acrylic tank filled with a fluid similar to Schaffer's amniotic fluid and attached to a machine that acts as a placenta to bring oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Kuwabara has successfully delivered goats from this artificial womb after just three weeks of gestation--the equivalent of one human trimester. Kuwabara says that, with enough funding, his ectogenetic chamber could be ready to use on a human fetus within five years.<br>
<br>
While these scientists have no political agenda, the same can't be said for one of the earliest advocates of ectogenesis, Dr. William Cooper. In 1993, Cooper, then head of the Christian Fertility Institute, patented a &quot;placental chamber,&quot; in which the fetus would gestate at the bottom of a tank and the placenta would rest on a shelf at the top. Cooper's invention went nowhere--today's advances toward ectogenesis owe nothing to the &quot;placental chamber&quot;--but his <br>
motivations for devising it are instructive: He hoped it would undermine Roe v. Wade.<br>
<br>
Roe v. Wade, after all, is predicated on two basic ideas: a woman's right to privacy (including the right not to be pregnant) and the viability of the fetus--defined as the ability to survive outside the mother's womb, currently placed at 24 weeks of gestation. Complete ectogenesis could dismantle both of these premises. First, it could make Roe's viability issue moot, since with ectogenesis a fetus could be echnically viable outside the mother's womb from the <br>
moment of conception.<br>
<br>
Which would surely impact the other idea underpinning Roe: a woman's right to privacy. With ectogenesis, an unwanted fetus, rather than being aborted, could be removed from a woman and placed in an ectogenetic chamber to be adopted later; the woman's right to privacy would arguably not be invaded, since removal of the fetus for implantation in an artificial womb need not be any more invasive than the abortion she was originally seeking. As bioethicists Peter <br>
Singer and Deane Wells write of ectogenesis in their book making Babies: The New Science and Ethics of Conception, &quot;Freedom to choose what is to happen to one's body is one thing; freedom to insist on the death of a being that is capable of living outside of one's body is another.&quot;<br>
<br>
Although many right-to-lifers are skeptical of reproductive <br>
technology in general and view ectogenesis as an unnatural and dehumanizing possibility, others recognize that it could radically alter the abortion debate. &quot;Roe v. Wade should be repealed anyway,&quot;says Dr. W. David Hager, an obstetrician-gynecologist and professor at the University of Kentucky School of Medicine who currently serves as head of the Bush administration's Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Committee. &quot;But, if we had the technology to be able to placentize or incubate in a placental environment, then I would say that would be an argument in favor of repeal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Other pro-life activists believe ectogenesis could change public attitudes about abortion in much the way The Silent Scream--the film, taken with a sonogram, that graphically documents the abortion process from extraction to destruction--did after its 1984 release. In his book, The Hand of God, Dr. Bernard Nathanson, the former abortion doctor turned pro-life activist who filmed The Silent Scream, writes of the &quot;enormous threat to abortion forces&quot; that the film precipitated due to its powerful imagery. Nathanson hopes that an acrylic ectogenetic chamber, containing a month-old fetus, could act as a similar visual aid. &quot;If [the fetus is] viable from ten weeks on,&quot; he says, &quot;you've destroyed Roe v. Wade. It collapses.&quot;<br>
<br>
But, while some pro-lifers have begun grappling with this <br>
possibility, not one of the five major pro-choice organizations I contacted--Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, the National Organization for Women, naral Pro-Choice America, and the Feminist Majority Foundation--has a position on ectogenesis. &quot;For naral it's really important not to get distracted,&quot; legal director Cavendish told me. &quot;We have to keep an eye on the prize of electing officials devoted to keeping Roe v. Wade. We can't pay too much attention to every potential tactic pro-<br>
life may use to distract us from our goal--which remains the same, notwithstanding new technological developments.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yet, while the pro-choice mainstream remains silent on ectogenesis, more radical voices have filled the vacuum. Writing about ectogenesis in her book Human Reproduction: Principles, Practices, Policies, feminist philosopher Christine Overall argues that abortion is about the right not to procreate, not simply the right not to be pregnant. Overall claims that fetal extinction--not just extraction--is the aim of women seeking abortions and that forcing a woman to submit to a fetal extraction is like forcing her to donate organs against her will. The pregnant woman, Overall writes, is <br>
the &quot;most appropriate person--perhaps the only one--to decide the disposition of the fetus.&quot; Extraction, extinction, disposition: Is this how the pro-choice movement wants their side of the debate to be framed in a post-ectogenesis world?<br>
<br>
Surely there are more sophisticated arguments to be made for <br>
abortion rights in the face of ectogenesis: women who might raise their children in poverty rather than use an ectogenesis-adoption solution and face the emotional turmoil of knowing that someone else is raising their child; pregnancies resulting from rape that might be better terminated than saved; changes that could occur in the scope of fathers' rights vis a vis mothers. But you won't hear these arguments from mainstream pro-choice groups. Nor will you hear the alternative: that ectogenesis could lead to an agreement with the pro-life side that transcends the abortion debate altogether.<br>
<br>
For now, the pro-choice movement is ignoring the prospect of <br>
ectogenesis at its own peril. If and when ectogenesis becomes a reality, it will redefine the abortion debate. Just consider the issue of viability: 41 states ban abortion after viability; if ectogenesis is achieved, will abortion then become illegal in each of those states? Many pro-lifers will certainly be prepared to argue yes. Isn't it about time pro-choicers start thinking of what they will say in response?<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
If ectogenesis is a viable alternative to an abortion, how could anyone still be in favor of abortion?  Do the pro-abortion people in the audience think their stance will change if this becomes a reality?<br>
<br>
I found the viewpoints of several pro-abortion people in the article to be particularly disturbing.  Abortion isn't really about womens right to privacy--that is just cover to make it palatable to the public.  They want to the right to kill their children.<br>
<br>
Dumai <p>&quot;We must move forward, not backward, upward not forward,<br>
and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom.&quot;-Kang<br>

<br>
If this was viable and cost roughly the same as an abortion (or was covered by insurance) I'd support it over abortion.  Most abortions are done because the fetus is unwanted, and the courts have determined that a woman has the right to choose what happens to her own body.  Your little bible-thumper jab at the end ('they just want the right to kill their children') can't possibly be what you really believe; or do you think everyone who gets an abortion is just fulfilling some itch to commit murder, and is doing it in a legal way?<br>
<br>
Are so many people in your view of the world (must be all those hell-destined non-christians) looking for ANY excuse to murder someone that they'd go ahead and get pregnant just for the joy of getting an abortion?<br>
<br>
That is truly absurd.  I cannot hope to sum up EVERY reason someone gets an abortion in one statement, and hell, there probably ARE some sickos out there who do it for a) attention or b) to fulfill some murderous intent (but then again christians molest children and burn non-WASPs on crosses...) but I think everyone can agree that 99% of abortions come down to the simple case of an accidental pregnancy (or serious life-changing circumstances like a couple gets divorced while 2-3 months pregnant).  If people were given the choice to have the baby born in a machine and auctioned off for the same cost/convenience (not that an abortion is &quot;convenient&quot; so that'd be easy to meet heh) I would guess most people would choose that path.<br>
<br>
in fact, if those criteria were met, I'd probably support making that path the mandatory one.<br>
<br>
Surprised at that view?  I also am curious what other pro-choicers think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

If this &quot;artificial womb&quot; were as cheap as an abortion, it should be an alternative which would provide healthy babies to people who want to adopt.  That thought is nice and cheery and cuddly.<br>
<br>
But, the cuddly side brings more problems that can be viably supported.  Let's suppose that all the people who want to adopt children can adopt artificially born babies.  What happens to all the children that float around in foster care and adoption centers?  If you want to have a child but can't make one naturally, you should be willing to take a child that is young but not an infant.  Who cares if the kid isn't yours and knows you're not the real parents?  If you're a loving parent, it won't make a shits' worth of difference, to you, or to the child.  It's not like we can euthanize all our spare children, like we do with stray dogs and cats.<br>
<br>
What about the cost of the procedure?  I know, without a second thought, that incubating a child for months is going to be more expensive than vacuuming one out of a woman.  If you can't see that, I wonder if anything anyone says would change your view.  Who foots the bill, then?  Will this technology be something that is only available to the wealthiest of the wealthy?  I'm no fan of double standards for preservation of &quot;life&quot; (I'm not going to wade into the &quot;When does life start&quot; debate here).<br>
<br>
My conclusion on this thread: this technology should only be used when a mother has been killed (or the pregnancy threatens her life) and the technology would potentially save the mother's life and allow for the child to mature properly.  Creation of millions of new people is not a solution to any problem, given the overpopulation of the world at large.  If I had a say in lawmaking, I would write the law just as I have concluded.  It wouldn't criminalize abortion, and it wouldn't mandate using this &quot;ectogenesis&quot; stuff either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=largthemiserable>Largthemiserable</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 686<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/21/03 1:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=841.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ectogenesis</span><hr size=1> Damn slow typing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Those most adamantly pro-abortion do not view a fetus as a child - as a human.<br>
<br>
Whether it is viable or not outside the womb means nothing to them.  It's really a starkly either/or case, unless you are willing to put a price tag on human life, which is something I believe very few of us are willing to do.  Either a fetus is a person, or it's not.  Viability outside the womb was a great way to get Roe v. Wade decided for abortion, and it may have even been consistent with contemporary beliefs, but for organizations like NARAL and those who follow them, the terms of debate are different.<br>
<br>
An excellent display of this:<br>
<br>
&quot;Most abortions are done because the fetus is unwanted, and the courts have determined that a woman has the right to choose what happens to her own body.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's a fetus, not a person, or a child.  It is part of a woman, having no individual definition.<br>
<br>
I simply can't come to grips with that.  It doesn't make sense to me.  To those whom it does, abortion is perfectly acceptable, and always will be, regardless.  Of course, like Tuwene said, if there is an affordable alternative, sure!  Why not?  But it's not like there's anything really wrong with abortion in the first place...<br>
<br>

The problem is will the conservatives be willing to care for the children who won't be adopted? They already fight taking care of the children that are born now.
