Quickly drawing himself a cold dark draft ale from Julep's Ale Chilling device, he thumped himself down on his chair and downed half the mug in one quick swallow, the ale quickly slaking his thirst.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The whole problem</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is that summoned ale in Hate and Fear always comes out warm. Cazic and Inny must like it that way...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Something under Gnostik's foot crinkled as he stepped on it, and he pushed his chair away from the table to peer underneath - an envelope was there, his foot half-crumpling it against the table's foot. He sighed. Yet another note shoved under his door. Just once, Gnostik wished that people would just deliver letters by hand.<br>
<br>
Picking it up, he peering at the red wax seal on the back. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Karthanon's seal, unless my eyes are gettin' too weak in my dotage</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  May as well see what th'lad wants.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Finishing the rest of the ale and dropping the jack on the table, he grabbed his pipe and lit it, the acrid fumes making him cough lightly as the pipe smoke swirled about his head until it was whisked away through a small out-vent in the ceiling of his room. Leaning back in his chair, the worn padded leather cushioning his stout frame, he read it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Friend Gnostik,<br>
<br>
Greetings and salutations to you, whenever you read this letter. First off, I just wanted ya to know that I'm not in trouble (thankfully) and that there's no real earth-shakin' things happenin' with me, but I've decided on somethin' and I wanted ta let you know if it.<br>
<br>
I'm tired, Gnostik. All th'trainin' that I've had over th'years, and then the subsequent battles with both the Champions and th'Tears, plus lingering side effects of th'fight with Aseop and my torture by Morticianne..it's time fer me to take some time to think about what I want ta do, my friend. Maybe try my hand at some skills, perhaps follow in yer footsteps and do some blacksmithin'.<br>
<br>
In any case, I wanted ta let you and Kinmerya where I've gotten to. Knowin' my niece, she'll hunt me down and after she's beaten me senseless with that hammer of hers she'll give me a few summoned Ales and she'll do the same. I'm a-headin' to Highpass Hold, my friend, ta visit Hardolar and the rest of the Highpass Irregulars at the Tiger's Roar. I hadn't heard 'o' any news about their battles shortly after th'Champions joined th'Tears, so I thought I'd go look up our former companion and erstwhile friend and assist him in th'fight if it's still goin' on, or otherwise sit and chat with that old dwarf and see if his wisdom can assist me in decidin' where th'path of my life can lead me.<br>
<br>
I've cleaned out me room here - any new Tears companions that come after I've gone can take it, as it may be awhile before I'm back. I'm sure that with the amount 'o' people that be joinin' lately we'll need to expand th'guildhall, so no fears about me not havin' a room (or perhaps havin' to sleep in th'stables...) later.  No worries, though, friend, as I'll be back.<br>
<br>
Thank you fer all th'help and assistance since you first met me - it seems like such a long time ago, after all. Heh! I remember you standin' and watching as me and a little aviak chick went toe ta toe in Butcherblock, and that grin you had on yer face as you watched. And to all me other friends that I've made, both in th'Champions, Tears, and other guilds that dot th'face of Norrath. All of ya have certainly helped make me time here enjoyable and fun - and I salute you all.<br>
<br>
For now, however, I must go. I'll send ya messages every once in a while, if th'old messenger service in th'Roar still be workin'. I know Hardolar will like the company.<br>
<br>
And secondly, my friend, there's th'matter of that half-elf Ranger, Arvarien Treesinger. Yes, *that* little sot.<br>
<br>
After I was tended back ta health by Brylee, mourned Kierenya's half-sister, I watched as sorrowful Arvarien and Brylee began on their own little personal journey together. Friends at first, and then after Kierenya's death their bonds became closer, forged by such a sorrowful event into something stronger than steel. Whether it be th'hand of Tunare of these things, or perhaps the hands of Love itself do be interferin' in their lives, it seems that they've fallen in love with each other.<br>
<br>
Which is all well and good, I suppose - this old dwarf don't know th'meanin' of the word. Arvarien and Brylee both are walkin' out with each other now fer a short while, and 'e whispered to me if there'd be any way I could get you to perform their weddin' ceremony. He knows that a representative to Tunare would have to be around, as a Brell worshipper's weddin' blessin's may not be acceptable in th' eyes of Tunare (and all that rot), but as he's a former guildmate he thought you'd be proud ta do it.<br>
<br>
They're setting a date soon, I believe. He said once he received word from ya they'd set one and post th'notices and such. <br>
<br>
And there's the other reason - he did ask me ta be his Man of Honor, but I refused. My luck (or lack of it) in being involved in th'removing of Aseop's curse, however indirect, caused th'death of someone who was close to me and brought their loved ones much pain. I can't bear ta be the witness to such, as it'll remind me of everythin' that's happened. I know that it be a happy occaison and they both have my every ounce of joy to give to 'em, but I can't be there. I'll hoist a drink or two with Hardolar in their honor on that day.<br>
<br>
But I won't be goin'. The pain is still too harsh.<br>
<br>
Good day, my friend, and I hope Brell smiles upon ya. No fear, I'll keep in touch. And if ya'd be so good, please post this in th'guildhall notice board, so if anyone be wonderin' where I be they kin find out.<br>
<br>
Thank you, my friend. Good journeys to you, whereever you may fare, and hopefully th'end of every journey finds you amon friends with yer pipe, yer ale, a pocketful of gold (or even fine gems), and th'companionship of yer friends around you.<br>

<br>
Sand was quickly poured across the pages, and then blown off as it quickly removed excess ink. The pages were folded, placed in an envelope, and handed, wordlessly, to a nearby courier. The courier bowed, opened the inn door, and left silently, leaving a stumpy figure leaning over an inn table - an image which disappeared into the darkness as the last candle burnt out.<br>
<br>
* * * * <br>
<br>
Gnostik accepted the letter with surprise from a courier - who had apparently run his way from Highhold Pass forsaking the easier methods of travel via the Plane of Knowledge. The courier bowed and left, as Gnostik peered at the wax seal on the envelope.<br>
<br>
It appeared it had come from the Tiger's Roar, the Champion of the Light guildhall. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Most likely a letter from Karthanon</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, he thought, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>it's about time that lad had the time ta write us.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Cracking the seal, he sat down in his reading chair and propped his feet up as he lifted the pages out of the envelope. Opening them, he was surprised to see dwarven runes rather than the elvish that Karthanon liked to use for formal letter writing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> To the Tears of Veeshan Guildhall,<br>
c/o Gnostik Gnollhugger, Keil Loraleaf, Crance Clearspirit, Steoff Miback<br>
From: Hardolar, Innkeeper of the Tiger's Roar, Highpass, Antonica<br>
<br>
To my friends and former guildmates, Greetings!<br>
<br>
I hope this letter finds you all in good health and still traipsing about Norrath in your own manners - although I hear you've all been through the new portals into the Planes..in any case, I wish you all luck in your endeavors. <br>
<br>
However, this note is not one to be happily be read, in any case.<br>
<br>
Karthanon came to speak with me about his place in the world, and of how tired he was of adventuring, at least for a time. We spent more than a few nights over kegs of ale and such speaking of adventures and companions we had had over the years. He spent some time here in Highpass working on his smithing, and I saw glances of that young dwarf that originally had joined the Champions long ago. He was happy, I think, doing that - creating things out of metal that could be used for other purposes (he was very proud of his first ornamental hinge, for instance, and showed it off to everyone - even the smugglers, who for some reason bought him drinks and cheered on his advances), rather than using his skill on the field of combat, for once.<br>
<br>
We had received word from Galain to be on the watch for intrusive measures by House Rea'Morda, as Ripfang had appeared asking for readmittance to the Champions of the Light - and apparently a few members of the House (both Ripfang's mother, Mommafang, as well as a companion of hers - an Iksar monk) took issue with that. A battle of words ensued, which led Galain to issue a proclamation to the House that if any members of Rea'Morda attempted to remove Ripfang from the membership of the Light that they would be slain on the spot. <br>
<br>
Karthanon, hearing of this, decided to work on the defenses of the Tiger's Roar. He spent time drilling the HighPass Irregulars in combat, single and group, and smithed weapons and armor for them to replaced the tarnished weapons they pulled from old shacks and chicken coops, somewhere. Kinmerya was here as well, teaching the oldsters and young ones of healing potions and the like in the case that the House did attack, either in small groups or in force.<br>
<br>
It was during one of these times that Karthanon was discussion defensive fortifications with one of our gnomes on staff by name of Gilber Fizzlepuff here at the Tiger's Roar that something happened. It was, by all appearances, an accident. We had stonemasons from Highpass Keep here to work on a defensive stone wall for archers on the cliffs above the Inn, and they were lifting a heavy block of granite to the rim of the cliff when the contraption they were using apparently malfunctioned and the block fell to the ground - killing Gilber instantly. It also, sadly, trapped Karthanon's legs underneath the block, crushing them to jelly.<br>
<br>
We were able to get the block off of him, but even with Kinmerya's healing abilities she was not able to heal something such as that - his legs were twisted beyond all recognition, and although we were able to save his legs and not amputate them, it seems to be a certainly that he will never walk again. Karthanon fell into a deep depression, and rarely left his quarters, refusing to be 'taken care of like a babe', in his own words. <br>
<br>
It took a turn for the worse, as his legs became infected - Karthanon spent hours pretending everything was all right, rejecting any offer of assistance and healing. He ended up going to his quarters two days ago with an extremely high fever and delirium. We posted a caretaker to his room, as was proper, and a guard in case he became violent.<br>
<br>
The caretaker was found last night, knocked out, as was the guard - it looks like Karthanon, in his delirium, was able to knock them both out with the pommel of a dagger, which we found underneath the bed the next day.<br>
<br>
We were able to trace where he went immediately after that - his legs were oozing a thick combination of pus and blood - he dragged himself using his arms from his room up to the bar area, and then out and over the sill into the pool outside.<br>
<br>
The next morning, when we discovered both the guard and nurse still unconscious, we searched the pools for Karthanon's form, but found nothing. None of the smugglers admit to have seen anything, and interrogation of the orcs in the area has not brought up any other information - and elven trackers that were staying at the inn who volunteered their skills did not find any trace of him either - although, as one admitted to me, their skills don't extend to following someone through water. As much as I'd like to believe that Karthanon is alive, I am forced to admit as that the evidence suggests that he suicided and is deceased.<br>
<br>
Kinmerya has gone into dwarven reclusion due to the loss of a close relative and friend, and will not speak to anyone, as is proper for our dwarven customs.  I am sorry to have to report this to you, my friends, but I thought that you would want to know of this happening even though I know you are busy in your fight again the Wurm Queen's minions. Be assured that the service we held for him did him justice, and many a Brell's Holy Ale was lifted for his spirit.<br>
<br>
Ad Valorium, and in memory,<br>
<br>
Hardolar, Innkeeper of the Tiger's Roar<br>
