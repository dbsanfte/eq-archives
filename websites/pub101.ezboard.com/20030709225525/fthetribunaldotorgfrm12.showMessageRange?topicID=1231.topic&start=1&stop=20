Both of them I consider friends of mine. The reason  Judeis is sitting atop the POMS list is pretty simple. He Asked Sendri to leave Overlords of Anarchy, I have asked for proof of  all of the names of people who can prove Sendris story of sexual Misconduct. Or even logs of this. None were provided to me. She has told people that Fabinki tried to set up a meeting  with her and Judies, Wrong answer. I tried to set the meeting up with her and Jude and I sat in NK at the spires with her and told her That they really needed to meet and discuss things with each other. I finally talked Jude into meeting and when I did she said whoops I gotta Log.  <br>
     My Question here is simple. Sendri If you left the server, which also cost you 50$, because of judeis why would you come back to the Tribunal? Which cost you another 50$. And why would you come back as the same name? Why are there no GM records on Judeis? and if Judeis Really messed with a 13 year old on line, ohh wait last you told some one she was 14. Why is there no federal investigation on this person? should be since it is  computers and a interstate crime. I am confused here. I never got the proof that this happened. Why do you not have any in game logs? Or e-mails form judeis?   If you have no proof I would suggest Judeis name be Removed From the POMS. <br>
     Moderator i Promise you this . I am not the only one tired of seeing him atop the list when there are people who take other people into a PvP zone and forces them to cyber and if they dont cyber they bind them and kill em. I think that  is BS atleast people have proof  who brought you that info.. Or is it hearsay as well. You do say that youll make up some shit about people if they piss you off. I have heard sendri is a friend of yours as well.  This will not be the last post on this board. several other people will be here to make this  point clear.  We want judeis' name off the flame board list.<br>
<br>
     Just too many things are outta wack here. I asked sendri for proof, none provided. I ask Judeis for proof i give you a clean name on the tribunal server with no notes in his file, And no personal record or police involvment. <p><center><table border=3 cell padding=4 width=300><tr><td align=center><center><bold><font size="5"><i><href="http://www.eq-remnant.com"><u>Raylar Sonstorm</U></href><br><font size="3"><bold> Guild Leader<br> Remnants Of the Tribunal<br> Warrior Of the North</table></tr></td></center></bold></i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uhayzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hayzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/16/02 3:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Judeis and Sendri</span><hr size=1> I thought this particular drama already got played out on this forum once before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulilum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 297<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/16/02 3:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Judeis and Sendri</span><hr size=1> Raylar maybe if you had come here six months ago when this was first brought up you might have a leg to stand on.

It is not impossible. Easy said as that. I dont care about 6 months ago .. and FYI it has been longer than that. If the moderator has any honor he will  remove this, on a promise he made to some one he e-mailed stating if he gets 10 posts in defense of judeis he will remove it.  Just because people post, who happen to all be in game and telephone friends does not matter. Where is the proof? I don't want accusations. What happened to Innocent until proven guilty. I guess all i have to do is accuse you of being a sexual predator on line and get 10 other people to accuse you the same way and it  will be done. I want logs. You mean to tell me out of all the several accusations no one has logs? I want Proof. If not i want Judeis off the POMS.

<br>
Why would a moderator remove a name on the basis of 10 posts (or posters) defending him or her? As you so cleverly pointed out, you could just get 10 friends or paid posters come along and post glowing references about Judeis. For the same reason, the moderators are very careful about who gets added to the PoMS list - there have been far more &quot;suggestions&quot; for the PoMS than actual additions.<br>
<br>
On top of that, I don't believe a single name that has gone on there has later been retracted as an &quot;error&quot;, so I am far more inclined to believe Judeis is the lowlife piece of sexually harrassing shit that the PoMS says he is than your word that he isn't.<br>

Even e-mail it to me with a high tech &quot; this message will self destruct in &lt;bang&gt;. The reason I want Proof is because i know both of them. It didnt happen.

       Your investigation is rather lame. You claim you have proof that Jude has clean records, how do we know this? Did you contact Verant about potential harrassment he has done? I can tell you they wouldnt tell you shit, its part of their privacy policy. So what you know is dependent on your gut feeling for your friend and a skittish witness whom you probably harassed threatening to bring some supposed legal action. <br>
<br>
       You seem like an ass and your friend seems like an even bigger ass. Why isnt Jude defending himself? Why did you take this crusade on? Are you perhaps Jude himself? Are you real life friends with him and he cried on your shoulder about this list and you want to defend your boyfriend? You seem quite obessed about this.<br>
<br>
       So far, Mike, you have come here telling people what to do, and to hate this person and not hate this person. You seem like a very nosey bitch to me, who wants to tell others what to do. Its a classic example of someone who's life is out of control and they are attempting to control a snippet of their life online where they believe they have power. You believe people will listen to you here because no one listens to you on the radio, so you are attempting to establish some sort of position here. You are failing and failing miserably.<br>

     Never had a complaint with you. at all. Just a nice spot for you to &lt;insert smart fucking comment here&gt;. But If you think Jude was a Queer then, Why would he want Sendri? Either way Name still gotta come off here. I wont leave till I am banned from the message Board Or Name is Off. There are your Options. If i am banned, well lets Just say some body is scared of the truth. <br>
<br>
     The reason why I did not post here before was on request of Judeis. He read the posts I put up here about Darkpaws and wanted to step up an ddefend me. But i said NO These Guys are so predictable that if you leave it alone for about 2 days it will Go away. what happened? went Away.&lt; lol watch it miraculously come back now&gt; you all are so predictable it is pathetic. <p><center><table border=3 cell padding=4 width=300><tr><td align=center><center><bold><font size="5"><i><href="http://www.eq-remnant.com"><u>Raylar Sonstorm</U></href><br><font size="3"><bold> Guild Leader<br> Remnants Of the Tribunal<br> Warrior Of the North</table></tr></td></center></bold></i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utakkarkattattack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Takkar Kattattack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/16/02 5:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Judeis and Sendri</span><hr size=1> I posted before and we all know that I think jude is a great guy.  And I have talked with people that where present at the time of the fall out between Jude and Sendri.  It seems to me as if this is just not true or that there had some miss understanding between him and her.  The thing is that Raylar asked for proof and you all say we don't need to prove anything to you.  I don't know how it works on the internet but I know that if you say something to hurt the rep of a person that is not fully true that’s called slander and that against the law, and if you write something about someone that can not be proved its called libel, this is also against the law.  I just think that if someone is being &quot;Flamed&quot; the person doing the flaming should have to prove it.  If they don't have to prove then its just rumors.  If that is the case then I hope no one takes this place seriously.<br>

Ah the thread I been waiting for! Maybe this time it won't be DELETED.... Before I even go in what I know, I would like to do what Jerry Spring does when closing his show's. My final thoughts  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Well, first Judeis, did you really fuck Sendri over and over again til she left the server and was it good? Is she back for more up the good ole arse? Second, as for Sorran stating this isnt a court of law, bingo your right brains! But it is a court for judging on a persons said action's... Key word SAID cause there isnt proof but simple rules of having friends send in emails stating the same thing.  As far as the name being retracted as a so called &quot;Error&quot; would be a sign of a mistake, will anyone be willing to take that chance to say? So yes, its easy to believe what they write in the post.  As for Balorf, lmao I been far reading too many post on you. Thank God your uber in game cause your not in real life buddy!<br>
Go find another guild to use for your personal things. Soon Requiem will drop ya faster than the shit that comes out of your mouth.<br>
<br>
Breath in Breath out Breath in Breath out Breath in Breath out<br>
<br>
Now for sendri, what I had posted a week ago and sent emails to good ole lad on why this is a lie and set out for merly revenge. People do know this is the Sendri that was married 3 times already right? This is the same Sendri that tells people she ran away &lt;to join the circus&gt;&lt;trust me this crap is real&gt; and that she was in your area and loved the state during her stay? This is the Sendri that claims to have her Grandmother living in your state and she might go back to visit again? But yet shes being harassed for sex? Seems like she loves it in anyway she can get it Via cyber or human partner. Is this the Sendri that claims it was to her or in her story of a email he talked to a 14 year old girl whos dad is angry and wants revenge?&lt;theres a another key point to why its a lie, so far two storyies&gt;&lt;good sign eh mate's&gt; Married three times also? Trust me theres a good story to those too. Speaking of which, your last hubby which is a female girl&lt;male who likes to play female characters cause of their tit's&gt; could you do me a huge favor there sweet pants! Take the fucking name &quot;Disorder&quot; off, there are people who like to play this game and get away from the real life from problems. To see you not only spreading bull shit but parading around with that over your head and being proud of it makes me fucking sick, do it for yourself if not others to correct that on top of your lies. Than again, maybe your back for another good ole fuck!<br>
