and add this one for flavor<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Actually, my exact comment was. I wonder how YOUR admission coincides with their decline standards.. I dont even know where you get half of that.. But I meant exactly what I said.. It does not imply that you poisoned them.

And read carefully.. there is no rush here.. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Your first statement says that you wonder how my joining might show the decline.....Right?<br>
<br>
Ok that said, i took that My joining was either a showing factor in...or a related event in leading to....the decline of the leets. If either statement was true, why didnt you come out with this awe-inspiring idea 2 years ago? I'll tell you why, cause you dont know what you are talking about.<br>
<br>
(enough quote shit like Bowynn loves to do, because you dont seem capable of wrapping your head around the way it happens, wouldnt want to confuse you further)<br>
<br>
I wouldnt join revo if i was the last cleric on the server. Thats because, reguardless of the people in your guild that i like, i now know thier GL is an utter twat, and EV is the last guild i will bother with after playing the game so long. I found my home and i like it here.<br>
<br>
You think you are the EQ einstien we have all been looking for all these years? You think that you happen to be the Special one that figured out that EV is dead, and LONG live any other guild that you percieve as being better than us? Heres a clue babe....As i said before, you are not the first, and you will not be the last. You are not original, and you couldnt be if you wanted too.<br>
<br>
Just for shits and giggles i'll give you a little idea of where i came from and how i got to where i'm at. <br>

I was a newb in the game and had fun figuring out shit, i was never, and still am not a true power gamer.  TS didnt last long and the woodie found himself being a founding member of a guild called Infinite.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2000</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Infinite and RoN talk alliance, and possible merger. The time i was in that guild was no more than a few days. I joined and left quickly because i didnt care for the way the people in the guild acted. It was nothing more than an asthetic thing. No hard feelings, and no bad spirits. I went on my own way, and pretty much solo'd a lot more levels.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2000</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Aat joins Legendary after grouping with a group of them in CoM. I go on my first real raids, PoF, PoH, i learn a LOT from the likes of Goram, Brianna, Hypersonic, Connovar, Mase, Ormak, and Talamay. <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2000</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->In 6/7ish months i made a lot of new friends and learned a lot about being a cleric. Then our guildleader leaves and gives control of the guild to a moron. This causes an exodus of a ton of people. Most leave and join SI.

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2000</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->I Joined SI because some close friends went there. Rathimis, Brianna, and a few others. I raided a few times(2 i think, including a Kith raid) and i joined.I wanted to be near my friends from Leg after getting close to them and regain our sense of friendship. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2000</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Not a week later i realised that guild wasnt for me. Wasnt anything personal, i didnt gain anything from them, and i didnt know what i wanted to do. I just knew i didnt feel at home. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2000</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I talk to an old friend named Thistleburr. burr was the reason i made Aatlaar in the first place. We had grouped and talked and i made aat...the rest is history. In any event Thistleburr asks me why i was guildless for so long one day. I think i was in KC...I told her i left leg, then SI, no bad blood, and i was guilded soon after. Thistleburr got me into the leets, and ive stayed. I found a lot of people i knew with my first char in the guild, i found a lot of friendship that i missed being guildless, and best of all i found my home. <br>
<br>
In the time between my first char and aat i almost quit a few times out of sheer aggrivation. I know DM can attest to that. In any event i stuck with it, i stayed with my friends as best i could, and i never lost my loyalty. I am a loyal person as i'm sure you are X. The thing is, you dont know what you talk about.<br>
<br>
I love my guild, and ive gone to great lengths of witch you will never comprehend to uphold the ideals that i hold close when in reguards to this guild. You may think we are all back stabbing pieces of shit, and thats fine, whatever floats your boat. the fact is i found later, than sooner, that these people are what i was always looking for. <br>
<br>
You think we bitch about loot? You are right, each guild does. The diff is that while that may happen, we have other driving forces that allow us to continue reguardless of seemingly difficult roadblocks. A Blinding need to do and see, and walk away. You can think that conceated, i see it as drive, and i respect the blind nature of it. We arent the only guild like that on our server. I respect other guilds like that, that do things before us. I dont shit my pants when they get a server first, but it does suck. Its all a race, and a matter of pride.<br>
<br>
You think we are threatened by the &quot;Re-imergence&quot; of the Vagrants? You have no idea whats going on there so you are best to not talk like you know anything for fear of pissing on both sides of the fence.<br>
<br>
You think we are 2 faced, and dont hold other people to our own standards, and take anyone post 60 that we can get? You couldnt be more wrong. I'll tell you what i know is wrong with that train of thought...We have in 2 classes ,a waiting list that comprises more than 10 people in guilds like yours and others. From what the trib considers Tier one to Tier 9, 10, 11, whatever... People that have expressed an interest in joining a class that we are currently, or have been, full of. This is not a statement of conceat, its more a statement of fact as i know it. Its always been that way and i imagine it always will be. See we dont go out of our way to Lure people to the guild. If we are lacking in some way, i'm sure our class captains send out feelers. That isnt a bad thing, thats the sense of self-preservation at work. A basic human response. <br>
<br>
See while you get all up in arms over the fact we guilded Gann and you are pissed that he took a KEY piece of loot from your guild in the process, we are still working our asses off to do things, and dont let your backtalk bullshit affect us.<br>
<br>
I think Gann is a good wizard, if he is a good person is yet to be determined in my mind as a fact. I think hes cool, and ive personally seen him do a fucking amazing job at what he does in a pressured situation. That was enough for me. If he took the robe and didnt give it back......well....that sucks. I cant control him, and dictate how he conducts himself and other people. I can enjoy the fact that we gained a good Wizard in our guild, and the fact our Class captain (Wizard) puts up with less shit than i ever could and Gann will be gone in a blink if he fucks up, and your stupid ass lost him. If this statement comes back to bite me in the ass i can live with that. In my time in this guild i havent backed many people with my approval. Its too up in the air and ive been fucked over enough. I gave my approval to Gann, and while my opnion might not measure up to much, thats fine. i did it and i will live with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So we are back to the point where you know ME beyond gereral shit you gained from my guild history, and how you discovered the great evil that is EV unlike the other 18 <br>
people before you that started this grand parade of stupidity.<br>
<br>
Come back with something consise and original, please.<br>

<br>
Revo will not be getting back that Manna robe..  <br>
<br>
and it is not EV's decision..   Its Gann's decision.. <br>
<br>
<br>
Dont flatter yourselves..   you should talk to him..   He would not give that robe back .. He would leave EV First..   He probably has more conviction than anyone else currently wearing an EV tag.   but of course he was a Revo member since the beginning..  thats not surprising..<br>
<br>
<br>
I havent asked him for that robe back.. since the day after he left Revo..  which coincidently was the day before he joined EV  ( LOL ) ..  He said he wasn't giving it back.. and he meant it.. <br>
<br>
I didn't come here to flame Ganndor.  I havent even used his name till just now.. I've known him since he was lvl 10..  I gave him his first non apprentice robe..  ( I should ask for that advisor robe back too ) ...  <br>
<br>
I came here to flame EV..  for showing such an amazing lack of any kind of standards or values ..  and to laugh at your pitiful desperation as you attempt to retain some amount of the glory that you used to know..  <br>

This is like suing vi because your son kills himself even though you admit he was fucked up in the head before.<br>
<br>
Not hard to say to yourself  'i was given this because i was a member, so maybe i should follow the rules of this guild and give it back before i go' and give it back.<br>
<br>
If EV said keep the robe and fuck that whore up the goat ass, it doesnt mean the right thing to do is keep the robe.<br>

<br>
Give credit where credit is due... The Elitists were probably formed within a week of the server opening in Aug '99.  Hardly a new guild in 2000.<br>
<br>
I may be off on my server history a bit, but I believe that Crush, Steele, Boggs, and crew (along with the Vags?) had already killed Nagafen before the year 2000 rolled around.<br>
<br>
This game was very different before serverside filters... 36 people was the most you could bring on a raid or else mass-LD would ensue.  If you could only have 36 for any given encounter, you better believe the 'top' guilds were phenomenally selective in who they took.  Having more than 50 members was nothing but a liability... I remember the fights we used to have in /gu when we'd have to close PoF or PoH raids to our own members once 36 were up there - last thing needed were 120 active raiding players.  I'm sure the Elitists and other raiding entities were going through much the same.<br>
<br>
The advent of serverside filtering, and the addition of content that REQUIRED more than 36 people (just try doing some SoV encounters upon its release with only 36... some even today I doubt you could do with only 36) changed things.  There's no longer incredible pressure for a raiding guild to stay as close to exactly 36 incredibly talented, well-balanced members as possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulejinabloodbath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lejina Bloodbath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thenking about Stay Pufft.!!!</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/2/02 11:19:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Xaviera !</span><hr size=1> Your complete lack of tact made E/V not sympathise with Revolution on this present problem, and thus, not making E/V even ask Ganndor to give back the robe.

<br>
You have no problem with EV, discuss the robe loot issue directly with Ganndor, if he doesnt want to give it back, why not flame him? Because you know as you said he is a man a conviction, not really, because you know no one would care if you flammed an ex member, and more so he could probably drop alot of trash on you and your guild, so you figure you try to illicit pressure on his current guild, hoping to force his hand, which you said yourself wont happen.<br>
<br>
You are taking this flame ev, make everyone jump on the bandwagon protest shit, its pretty lame, it all boils down to your inability to exert any real pressure on an ex member, if he felt he should give it back, he should, but according the rules he told us, he was in every right to keep the robe. Now if he was wrong about those rules, then talk to him, not us, we wont hash out your guild issues, its your mess, stop trying to pile into a hatred of EV and coming here with mindless dribble.<br>
<br>
It boils down to you not being able to effect Gann so you hope you can say EV sucks enough times that somehow we say, oh god, lets give it back, we arent as good as Xaviera thinks we should be. What you lack to comprehend, we dont give a rats ass what people outside our guild think of us, I dont care if you want to rate us just under circle of lemmings on your uberness scale, your rating of us, doesnt effect us, doesnt change what we do, or what we kill. We dont suddenly stop killing Shei and say, OH SHIT, wait, we arent good enough to do this, some pissant guildleader said so. <br>
<br>
So keep whining and bitching and moaning how EV sucks now, how everyone is a guildhopper, how people make EV sucky, how Mojak is crashing the ship, your opinion means jack shit. Saying all this though, to get back a mana robe is pretty sad. <br>
<br>
Ganndor was discussing this with Mojak and maybe Mojak would of believed your side had you not decided to harrass him, making yourself look like an ass, thus reinforcing the story Ganndor told.<br>
<br>
Mojak says your rules say give back droppable loot?<br>
Ganndor says they changed the rule only recently, they are just trying to fuck me over cause they are mad I left.<br>
Mojak says, well I think you should give....<br>
Xaveria shouts,  Glad EV is so sucky blah blah they take theives<br>
Mojak says oh shit, guess you are right that they are trying to fuck you over, I mean they came all the way here to harrass you, I am not making you do anything, its your call.<br>
<br>
You also make me laugh because YOU take NO responsiblity in this at all, that your guild might of forced his hand, that you did change the loot rules, did he agree to the new loot rules that were changed recently? <br>
<br>
He also makes a good case he earned the robe, but its his choice, when Javelyn joined EV, he returned his robe to the Comps because it was his choice, no one forced his hand, they Comps talked to him and he choose to return the item, now you on the other hand want to blame EV. Why not discuss this with him, if he doesnt want to give it back, let it go, its an issue between Revo and Gann, not between EV and Xaviera as much as you want to make it. Much like the mana robe Javelyn returned to Comps, the issue was Comps and Javelyn, not EV and Comps.<br>
<br>
Just because we ask for items back, doesnt mean we get them, same thing happened here, your issue is with him, not us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uloeganwolfheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 823<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/3/02 4:03:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Xaviera !</span><hr size=1> Let's get down to the bottom line. Asking for items back is selfish and a slap in the face. WTF should a member put in 6 hrs a night raiding for months, and then walk away empty handed?<br>
<br>
I can see when items are handed down. For instance, in EV I was handed down a ES BP from an older druid who had it handed down to him. Now if I left I would certainly give that back as it was handed down to me. But, if I am awarded an item at a raid, then I earned that item. To expect me to give it back when I leave the guild is to admit I was nothing but a tool used to get the guild where it wanted to be. It is the same as saying your time and effort was worth nothing and should not be rewarded.<br>
<br>
I still say, if you expect an item to remain in guild, then you state that at the TIME THEY LOOT IT. Tell them then - this is just to help the guild and if you leave fuck you, give it back and good riddance. Then you have a leg to stand on when asking for it back.<br>
<br>
Give back policies suck ass. If they didn't earn it, don't give it to em. If they grab loot and leave then you suck at screening new members. <p><br>

<br>
E/V believes that if a person leaves its Guild, that they do not have to give back any no drop items?<br>
<br>
This is an acceptable practice to them?<br>
<br>
Its not in their charter?<br>
<br>
What is really hilarious is all of you here saying Xav is talking out her ass, not one of you has set forth anything yet to dispute what she has said.<br>
<br>
I believe that once you all learn words longer than 5 letters it will make much more sense to you.<br>
<br>
Character A leaves a guild and is not asked to give back an item, but does anyways. He leaves the guild because of his timezone and can not raid with Guild Q. So happens that Char A has something that it seems E/V is lacking....honor. But Char A did not go to E/V.<br>
<br>
Weekish or so later..Char B leaves Guild Q. Same item..leaves without giving it back..Not one other guild would go near him until he gave this back. His acceptance in wearing the &quot;tag&quot; would hinge on his honor. But since that is not a requirement in joining E/V, I guess thats where you lose the meaning in all of this.<br>
<br>
Lemme put it to you this way.<br>
<br>
Char B goes to E/V..get his uber loot..gets pissy..leaves...<br>
does not give back any droppable items to E/V..why?<br>
<br>
Because he doesnt have to, seems from what is written here theres nothing said, implied or inferred to E/V's charter about returning, &quot;Items that are guild property&quot;.<br>
<br>
Im betting there is though.<br>
<br>
What is even more hilarious, is the fact he got &quot;tagged&quot; with this type of behavior. That's what you all are hedging around.<br>
He got &quot;tagged&quot; with stolen property. Hes a thief..and you accepted him in.<br>
<br>

Great accomplishment.<br>

    1) Why dont have a charter, sorry but even if we did, who the fuck are you to enforce how we govern our charter, if decide it doesnt work, but that is all if so, when so, cause we dont have one. Sorry but we got goals, no mission statement though, no charter.<br>
<br>
    2) How do you know EV guilded Gann with knowledge he had the robe under suspicious circumstances? Maybe no one knew, from what I see here, you all have glowing reviews of his skills, so why wouldnt we guild a level 60 wizard with good skills, and seems to be a generally nice fella?<br>
<br>
   3) Alot of people say no one has rebutted Xaveria yet because you all say the same thing, but I do believe clearly I have, the fight isnt with us, the robe is an issue of contest between your guild and Gann, not my guild and your guild. <br>
<br>
    4) EV has guilded and will guild who they wish to guild, because someone says they suck, or is a loot whore, we often dont heed that until we see it for ourselves, because, opinions are often influenced by feelings, and it is my understanding that you were hurt when he left, so what you are saying is chiefly influenced by the fact that you are upset about losing an item. So sad you are more upset about losing the item, then the person, but once again this isnt about Gann, its about a mana robe...right....<br>
<br>
     5) Our ranking on the server by someone who doesnt even do the things we do, doesnt really matter, its like a Circle of Lemming Member claiming that all Bog Brigade is the best guild on the server, but that doesnt make it true, nor does it hold any influence over anything, its like saying the sky is green. We do what we want to do, when we want to do it, how we want to do it, we arent effected by your whining and supposed rankings.<br>
<br>
     6) The Mana Robe is actually a very shitty robe compared to whats out there now, and used mostly for CRs, if your wizards need a mana robe to get mana back during a raid, thats pretty gay, as a certain staff/robe combo is more mana efficent when oom then clicking that god awful thing over and over for what? 30mana for 60hps. But then again its not the item itself in contention, but the fact that he kept said item.<br>
<br>
     7) Your flame of EV and subsequent insults are just a result of your inability to communicate to Gann. Your hope is to either guilt EV into forcing him to give back the robe, or to make him feel bad that you are stirring up shit for his new guild. Perhaps if you treated him better and talked to him instead of calling him a thief, he might of realized he would of gotten better loot in ev then a mana robe, but as I see it, with yer treatment of this issue, he should just say fuck off, I earned it.<br>
<br>
       8) I agree with Loegan on his above post, he makes a valid point, anything I earn with my guild, IE I am at the event, then fuck off I am keeping it, anything passed on to me to hold me over until a better no drop item can earned, I will hand back. Seems to me, he was at the trak raids, put in the time to help others get armor and weapons and his reward is to ask for an item he wishes to keep claiming he earned it. Comparing a mana robe to a computer on a job is lame, and really doesnt hold water. <br>
<br>
     9) Xaviera you seem to act as you are end all, know all about the goings on in guilds, or about guilds, stop, please, that spot is reserved for Rynnia, at least hes right 90% of the time ( fucking ass, something about ebay here ). Dropping all these &quot; I know about you, or I know what you did, or I know all about your guild &quot; is just getting old, you dont know shit, you only think you do. Stop pretending to be the expert on EV, and more so, on all guilds.<br>
<br>
     10) This issue is really between you guys and Gann, try talking to him, via email, or in game via tells, I am sure you could work something out, if not, ITS NOT OUR FUCKING PROBLEM. Can you understand that? If he doesnt want to give it back, then call him whatever you want, but it still doesnt involve our guild, as the battle is between you and him. Stop trying to stir up shit because of your inability to convince him to return said item.<br>
<br>
     11) As far as EV is concerned he isnt a thief, his claim is the rules were changed recently, he joined under one set of rules, unless you can show me somewhere he agreed to the new set of rules, then your new charter doesnt effect him. Goes back to the whole Taxiation without Representation, you changed the law without informing him, and getting his agreement, thus your contract to return said items does not hold, since no bind contract was made between said parties and it falls back to the default contract ( the initial guild rules he joined under ). Now if you can show me the initial rules saying to return ALL droppables to guild, then ya might have a case, as such you have altered said document after the fact. So us guilding him with no blackmark on him doesnt not reflect on EV at all, and your arguement about EV being desperate fades away. He is a 60 wizard with good skills ( your words not mine ) with decent items ( shows that he was either a loot whore or helped alot and had the help returned, but you never said he was a loot whore ), plus hes human, the best race in the game, you and I both know this, so thus the arguement we are getting desperate is quite silly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ujaeron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaeron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/3/02 6:08:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Xaviera !</span><hr size=1> Just a quick comment, as I won't involve myself in the flames, but will watch from a safe distance.

The fact that he was invited 2 days after leaving Revo, with said item, which is something EV knew but still decided to guild him, is the other issue. I think Xav already stated that clearly. He doesn't expect to get it back, so now he is attacking the people that &quot;embraced&quot; that act without so much as a single form of reprimand. There in lies two issues as well. Taking Gann without putting him through any sort of trial process in such a short duration, on top of taking him with an item that, by Revo guild policy (regardless of whether or not you think he is entitled to keep it) should have been returned to the guild.<br>
<br>
Now where have I heard this &quot;its shitty loot so why do you want it so badly&quot; logic before? Oh! I know. When EV killed Rhag 2 during an SI raid of the Rhags, taking the loot and then justifying the kill by saying &quot;Oh don't worry, it was ass loot, no harm no foul.&quot; Yet, like that incident, no body took credit for doing it, or apologized for doing it, but simply miscontrued it into looking like they had done them a favor. I gotta say that is pretty brilliant<br>
<br>
Gann is in EV now right? The uber of the uber! I'm sure he will have Sal Varae's robe in a weeks time. So why does he need to hold onto this &quot;ass loot?&quot;  Are you telling everyone to forget the policy, forget that by EV standards, it's not even a great robe, but to remember that Xav /ooc flamed Ganndor for what he did and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> thats</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> why you decided to let him keep it? Maybe it's me but that just doesn't sound logical. Or at the least, it sounds very weak willed.<br>

Of course you can always take the easy road and move on for the sole purpose of that next mild upgrade...New loot is great...exciting and fulfilling...for about 1/2 an hour till the novelty wears off.  Where are you left then?  With a bit better gear, lots of burnt bridges, and a surrounding that could care for you as a character.  You are cared ONLY for your 60 AA points.  Make you feel better?<br>
<br>
Again...just a comment for the general public here and no one individually.  Have some respect for yourselves and take pride in building and strengthening what you have.   Feel better to kill that next mob with the same people you've been trying with since the game started??  Or are you one that gets a great sense of accomplishment hopping on the bandwagon?<br>

I love when people say that, considering 95% percent of the flameboard is exactly that.  I think that could be an addition to Elche's little black book of worthless statements. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udeyatra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deyatra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>n00b</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/3/02 9:18:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Xaviera !</span><hr size=1> Said it when Gann when he left and quick warning to any EV that Gann desides are secretly working against him here.  Gann is Bi-polar and he doesn't know or believe it.  Gann is one heck of a good wizzy, but he needs to get that bloodwork done and try some meds.<br>
<br>
Don't believe me now?  Don't care I'm posting so I make him mad and he has the bloodwork to prove me wrong.  Gann I'm sure your seeing this - waist a trip and get the bloodwork done.  Show me how wrong I am.  That way maybe you wouldn't have to sell it as &quot;a joke&quot; when you have your next episode and start posted that you going to drive to someones house and shoot them dead because they are your moral enemy in EQ.<br>
<br>
Think about it Gann how many post have you made that you have to go back and disclaimer or find a spin angle for after you have had a nights sleep and are back to thinking straight again?  I couldn't care less about some toy in EQ Gann but people matter.  Get the test done.<br>
