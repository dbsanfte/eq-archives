<br>
You brought up intellectual points so I'm going to address questions you've asked here.  This isn't an indictment of your beliefs in any way, but now I have time to respond.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Heh, do I believe Alexander existed? yep.<br>
Do I believe Jesus existed? yep again.<br>
Do I believe Alexander cut the Gordian knot? nope.<br>
Do I believe Jesus was the son of god? nope.<br>
Just because someone existed does not make every word others wrote about him true. They wrote what they believed, what they wanted to believe and sometimes what they actually witnessed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I accept this as an informed and valid decision.  It is logical to say that you might believe that the events portrayed in the bible are not accurate descriptions of what happened, but it is ignorant to say that Jesus never existed.  If you argue he is a man, that is a matter of opinion, but his existance is a matter of fact.  So let me address a little more - I agree with most of what you said here, except for the part about what they wanted to believe.  I'll address it in a second here -<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Even people who profess to be historians have skewed the truth. Do you really think a &quot;disciple&quot; would be less prone to do so?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think that a believer in a religion has the most reason to skew facts and put their own unique views on things.  However, I don't think this was the case with early Christianity.  There are a few reasons for this, the first of all being motivation.<br>
There are several reasons why someone would deliberately lie about events in any situation.  I generally simplify these to a few key reasons -<br>
1)  Personal Gain<br>
2)  Trying to save face.<br>
I can't really think of a third reason that's too likely for this specific situation.<br>
<br>
On the issue of number 1 - The disciples had nothing to gain from their religion, and everything to lose.  At this time creating a Religion was NOT a way to make money or power - and realistically, the Jewish church would have offered FAR more money or power to a disciple who was willing to say that the rest were liars than the forming of a religion possibly could.  Aside from that, 11/12 disciples were Martyr'd.  You'd think that if they made the whole thing up to make some sort of profit, they would have recanted before death to spare themselves.<br>
<br>
On the issue of 2 - It is reasonable to think that perhaps Early Christians might have embelished upon their stories of Christ in order to make themselves not look stupid for following such a man.  But if you read the Bible, the disciples are generally portrayed as the last guy in the room to get the analogies - and there are more stories of the Disciples messing stuff up or doing things that Christ tells them are wrong than there are of them doing the right thing.  Certainly if it were to save face, they would look like the good guys.  And again, you have that Martyrdom thing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The fact is that religion is propagated by believers, NOT by documents. Documents are merely used to support the believers. Tell a person nothing about religion and turn them loose in a library with all the religious texts in the world. I seriously doubt they would have an easy time believing any of them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Are you speaking of documents in general or religious documents?  This is an important clarification.  For instance, several Roman scholars have listed things that seem to validate things listed in the Bible.  If you want to say that Religious Documents are made to support believers, I agree with you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm sure the christians have faith that christian texts would glow or something to guide this uneducated lamb to the only true religion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't argue this - I instead argue that Christianity is the most logical religion in my mind, at least.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And if you think the bible exists today exactly as it was written way back when, think again.<br>
The bible has been edited many times over the last millenia to conform to whatever the current oligarchy of organized religions wishes the masses to believe. Does this mean nothing from the original bible exists? Of course much of it does, it's more what has been taken out over the years.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This I do not agree with.  The problem with your theory that the bible has been revised and edited repeatedly would be valid if you didn't account for small things - like the fact that many of the newer translations don't even take the origional King James version into account when they work translations.  Instead, they focus on the origional documents that have been preserved and are overseen by panels of literally hundreds of experts on each and every translation.  It's argued over for words that are not direct translations, and newer tendencies are to list the origional word instead of trying to translate it.  The only thing we can argue for certain that has been removed are 4 &quot;Gospels&quot;, one of Mary the Virgin, and a few others that I can't recall at the moment (read brain fried from work).  These were generally not included because they were written long after the other gospels, and were not written by anyone who is documented as having seen Jesus or God, therefore in the eyes of the church they are not divinely inspired.  The Gospel of Mary the Virgin Mother was not written by her, by the way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now you can call these thoughts simplistic if you like, but what's really simple is the fact that religion is more a way to manipulate and control people.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I do find it interesting that you cry foul at the person who called you simple as attacking you, and end an otherwise intelligent post with making a blanket attack on the religion.<br>

<br>
Certainly.  Now I can't say that I've met anyone who would tell stories about miracles about someone they were enamoured of, but there are some other problems with this theory.<br>
<br>
If the Bible is full of rampant exaggerations, how could Christianity have risen in the areas where Jesus performed these exaggerated mircales?  I mean if you told me you could raise the dead and came to my house and we talked, and then suddenly 40 people said that you made a monkey fly out of your ass while I was there, I for sure would not believe in your status as a diety, in fact I'd say &quot;I was there, and that's not what happened.&quot;  But there are no recounts of the life of Christ written anywhere near the time of his existance.  But then again, lack of proof does not necessarily equate to lack of argument, so I'll give you that it is possible.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As for Mithraism, whether it predated Christianity or not (which it did) the fact remains that it was more popular than you've painted it at the time Christianity began to flourish.<br>

<br>
Saint Patrick was the one to put Christmas on December 25th.  The reason for this celebration was that he was trying to convert Celtic nations who practiced Paganism, and basically his idea was to come to them during winter Solstise and say &quot;I know you guys are having a party, we have those too, just for different reasons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Christmas itself is practiced as more of a Pagan holiday than a Christian one.  The big Christmas Tree is just one indication of that.  It's pretty obvious that Jesus was not born in December, the bible clearly mentions shepherds in the fields, which did not occur until Spring or Fall.  So I agree that the date of Christmas was moved to convert others.<br>
<br>
The difference in this and the issue of the tainted bible theory you propose is simple - it's far easier to change the practices of a religion than the tenets.  I am willing to believe many things about how the Church viewed things, and many things about how the church worships, but I can't believe that the Bible was changed to fit with the views of Mithras.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, Mithraism pradated Christianity.  I granted you that.  But if you are to read the Jewish bible, the miracles and virgin birth are prophecied in Isiah, which was written YEARS before any sort of Mithriasm proof has been shown.  The first statues of him are shown to have surfaced circa 671 BC If I am correct, whereas Isiah and earlier prophets who predicted similar events were at the latest around 750 BC.<br>
<br>
So basically what I'm saying is this - if you are going to argue the Christianity borrowing from Mithriasm thing, I'm going to argue that Mithriasm was entirely a fabrication based on early Jewish texts as a way to bring about new followers of the Pagan faith.  The other big thing to note here - Mithrias was ONE god in the pantheon of Pagan Rome.  And he really didn't get a large following documentable namely by the number of statues and temples dedicated to him until approximately 300 AD, so that doesn't seem to make him widespread as a common diety until a good 270 years after the birth of Christianity.<br>

I will argue that Christianity is vastly different than it was when it origionated.  But what I do not grant you is that the bible has changed, there is just too much proof to show that it is remarkably unchanged and correct in translations.  I don't think my Church is anything like the ones Paul wrote to in the New Testament.  Perceptions and interpretations of the texts change, but in my opinion, the texts themselves do not.<br>
<br>
Where I think we are having confusion is that you seem to use the Bible and Christianity as a Church interchangably.  This is really not the case.  If you say the Church changes and Dogma changes every century, I fully agree.  But you stated that the Bible itself does - which archaeology has repeatedly proven to not be the case.<br>

<br>
You brought up some very good points. I find it refreshing that you question your pastor, as I have actually never witnessed anyone doing that before. As for my comments on churches, I am indeed making a blanket statement.  <br>
<br>
For the most part I am entirely against the concept of a 'church' in the form a  building that needs money and funds to continue operating. The Church should simply be everyone who believes in Christ as their savior. You don't need a building to do that. Today, churches are found in wealthy areas and suburbs left and right. Most churches are already preaching to the choir--so it is simply a place of worship. And I don't feel God enjoys a lot of people dressing up in their Sunday best to take an hour or two out to worship him, toss in a donation, and then head back home.<br>
<br>
As for the New Testament passages on homosexuality, I discount them all. Anything that is not in the First 5 books of the New Testament has nothing regarding what Jesus said. Paul was the first real pastor and used his letters to keep his budding flock in line. Therefore, anything in Timothy, Corinthians, Romans, etc. doesn't mean anything to me because Jesus didn't say it. <br>
<br>
I respect your beliefs and the beliefs of everyone, unless their beliefs are founded on hurting other people. Life has always been a journey about finding yourself and your place in this world, and I refuse to condemn atheists, Wiccans, Buddhists or Hindus for how they live or what they believe.  <p><p><center>
