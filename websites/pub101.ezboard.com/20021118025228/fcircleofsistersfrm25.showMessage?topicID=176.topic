<br>
Nysa recently gave birth to twin daughters, one half-elf (Loreli) and another Tier'dal (Dalninil). The half-elf is a natural child, but the Tier'dal is a creation of strange magics, with the soul of a deceased priestess of Innoruuk. Despite this, Nysa loves both equally and tries to raise them as best she can.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
Nysa is a peaceful priestess of Erolissi Marr, and now an elder of the Circle of Sisters. She is devoted to her friends, and thrives in the company of others. She is devoted to her goddess as well, but does not always agree with the leaders of her faith, particularly the priests in the Temple of Marr in Freeport. Nysa steadfastly refuses to resort to violence, and never carries a weapon, even when travelling alone. She has two half-sisters, Bridh and Rowynia.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Background<br>
<br>
Nysa spent her early adulthood in the Temple of Marr learning from the priestesses of Erolissi. Though quiet at first, her curiosity triumphed over her shyness once she grew more comfortable with the sisterhood of the goddess. Eventually she could be found wandering the religious precincts of North Freeport, questioning everyone she could meet. Though she did not always understand what others had to say, she was always willing to listen. Only a few would notice that she would rarely speak of her own past.<br>
<br>
Though she loved the temple, Nysa worried that she was too isolated from the troubles that plagued Norrath, and wanted to see more of the world. The teachings of Erolissi compelled her to help others, and Nysa also did not want to be a burden on the temple. The priests of Marr were opposed to her leaving, feeling that she was not prepared for the dangers she might face. As those responsible for her debated the issue, she quietly slipped into the night, saying goodbye only to her closest friends.<br>
<br>
Nysa's first few months on the streets of Freeport were not easy. Though hungry and cold, Nysa refused to return to the shelter of the temple, fearing she would never be able to leave again. In time, she found that easy work could be had in the underside of the city, provided that she curbed her impulse to ask too many questions. In the company of these rogues and scoundrels, Nysa learned the story of the other side of the city, a story very different from the one told by the Knights of Truth.<br>
<br>
After a while she found more respectable work as an apprentice smith in East Freeport, and was able to earn enough money to wonder about leaving the city itself. Her first few excursions outside the gates terrified her. Everywhere there was violence and death. Nysa remained determined to stand on her own and help where she could, and she soon found that she could travel more safely in the company of other adventurers.<br>
<br>
Nysa is now carefully learning more about the greater world of Norrath. She marvels at the land's terrors and its wonders, and relishes the secrets that she learns. She cherishes the stories of her traveling companions, and wants nothing more than to help them discover their destinies, and perhaps her own.<br>

<br>
Since his loss of his powers, Pryce has seemed perhaps a bit... off.  He seems to look a bit different, but perhaps it's just that his facial hair has been shaved off.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
Pryce is a koada'dal enchanter with platinum hair and strange lilac eyes.  He comes off at first as very serious, formal, and high-elf-ish, but quickly shows an impish side and loves nothing more than to change his form to amuse others and infiltrate strange places.  He revels in his power at times and can be quite imperious.  His pride and joy is Pryce's Emporium, his traveling jewelcraft shop.  He often speaks of jewelcraft (and enchanting, to a lesser extent) as his Art with a pronounced *capital* &quot;A;&quot; and little seems more important to him than the perfection and marketing of his Art - his reputation is built upon jewelcrafting, and it seems to be the heart of his self-esteem.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
<br>
While he is a koada'dal who, at times, casually references a lifespan of 300 or more years, no one to whom you have spoken in the Faydark has met Pryce before he set up his Emporium outside the gates of Felwithe a scant few months ago.  He is not forthcoming about his past, often choosing, when pressed, to change the subject or change his form as a distraction.<br>
<br>
He was brought (half eager, half kicking and screaming) into the Clan of Brothers by the paladin Raen, for whom he clearly has a sisterly affection, and he's often seen in the company of Temolin the bard and Kelthalas the ranger.  Once an unhappy follower of the god Karana, Pryce apparently performed the arcane Rites of Separation to renounce the hold Karana had on him, but lost all his powers and skills in the process; this was very traumatic for him.  Various of the Brothers and Sisters helped him to his feet, cementing his (at first ambivalent) loyalty to the guilds, and Pryce is often seen doing intensive re-training with Briarboots Bandylegs in order to regain his lost powers.<br>
<br>
The training has fully taken, and Pryce has overtaken and leapt past his former skill at a shocking pace.  Pryce's Emporium is once again open, with a wider selection of wares than it had before.  But Pryce's newfound good humor is lately contrasted with sudden bursts of reclusiveness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ueqnysa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>eqnysa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Imagination<br>Elder</span><br>  Posts: 472<br> <font color=#660000>(3/9/02 12:06:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Minuet's Background</span><hr size=1> [Moved by Nysa]<br>
<br>
Minuet gently ran the oilcloth over the neck of her mandolin, massaging out the dirt and dust and, was that a new scratch? Many a time she had to resort to bashing a foe over the head with it when she was caught unarmed. Luckily it was a master crafted instrument, her father had said it was luthiered by Nostrolo himself. Minuet sang one of her father's favorite songs, as she attempted her best to deal with the new ding in her instrument.<br>
<br>
&quot;As he saw his life run away from him, thousands ran along,<br>
Chanting words from a song.<br>
As he saw his life run away from him, thousands ran along,<br>
Chanting words from a song.<br>
Please me have no regrets,<br>
Please me have no regrets.<br>
Came from the baby's mouth.<br>
We follow the lines going South.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her father had passed on the instrument to her before his death. He had lived a full life but had grown old rapidly as mortal men were want to do. With her mother's Elven heritage, Minuet was assured of living considerably longer then any human lover she could perhaps choose. She harboured doubts about a future with a single, let alone human, mate, especially after she witnessed the pain that he mother had endured at her father's passing. After her father died, her mother, Elliadril, started the Elven mourning period and she had taken Minuet from Qeynos over the sea to the forests of Faydwer. There she was able to meet more of her cousins and be schooled in the lore or her mother's lineage. Her Elven cousins laughed at her Qeynos accent and found her to be a quick-witted companion as they tolerated her bastardization of the Hometongue. She spent time mastering her father's mandolin and would wander through the heights of Kelethin, listening to the People's music, and picking out the tunes on the well aged wood.<br>
<br>
The pleasure of those languorous days was broken by the onslaught of the Crushbone Orcs, who had conspired with the Tier Dal and had come out of the Butcherblock Mountains in foul hordes after decade of relative serenity. So massive were their numbers that they were able to establish a foothold in the Greater Faydark and from there continually threaten the peace of her mother's home. Several of Minuet's cousins fell in the battles against the orc hordes, and it was a trying time for all. Minuet had intended to join the Guardians of the Faydark when she came of age, and stand with her cousins to protect their homeland. But that was not to be.<br>
<br>
Elliadril called Minuet into her chambers one cool fall evening. There had been a recent thrust from the orcs and it had been a long trying week, safeguarding the walls of Felwithe from the seemingly limitless mass of orcs that besieged it. Elliadril took Minuet's hand in her own. Her mother's beautiful face was worn and tired. She had been using her skills as a healer to assist and fortify the city's guardians, and it was a constant drain on her mother's strength. But there was something else in her face tonight that brought worry to Minuet.<br>
<br>
&quot;My beautiful child, how strange these times must be for you,&quot; her mother's voice was soothing. &quot;I had hoped that you would live your life unburdened by such violence and bloodshed, but that is not always meant to be. I regret that I must add another burden to your life. I have received the calling and must travel west, to Elvenholme. I will leave soon, when Luclin smiles again. This is a journey that you cannot make with me, as you are your father's daughter, and are meant to truly live among his kin. You are close enough of age now where you are able to choose your own path. You may remain here or return to Qeynos and our home there. If you wish for us to have a little more time together, we can journey to Qeynos, as it is from there that I will meet the vessel that will take me Elvenholme.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not wanting to leave her mother's side so soon, Minuet chose to travel with her back to Qeynos. The trip was bittersweet, as her bond with Elliadril only became stronger as they traveled and talked, her mother now speaking to her much more as the woman she was becoming and less as the curious child of the past. The arrival home came only too quickly. Their house in Qeynos had been closed up for some time, her father's tools cobwebbed and nest of pigeons taking advantage of a hole in the eaves. They spent her mother's last days there cleaning up the house, now Minuet's, and watching the sunset on the sea to the west. The departure was a tearful one for Minuet, as she watched the beautiful Elven ship depart the Qeynos docks and disappear into the horizon.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I can't decide, if this place is make-believe,<br>
Worked all my life, to turn sleet to snow.<br>
We will turn our heads into the sunset,<br>
As the storms rage in the East.<br>
And we're goin down to see my lady love.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now I'm not really interested,<br>
In telling you my mind.<br>
Just let me drag another before you go,<br>
I'm a broken wire.<br>
Now nobody knows where to find us,<br>
And it ain't nobody's loss.&quot;<br>
<br>
Minuet finished her song, to the modest applause of the crowd at Windspirit's Song. Many of them were accomplished minstrels in their own right but they had been supportive of Minuet and offered her patronage since the day she wandered into the Qeynos Bardic College. She had not been long in discovering her true calling, and felt that for the time, things were as they should be.<br>
<br>
Now, sitting in the shadow of the gigantic Combine spires, that performance seemed a lifetime ago. Minuet finished caring for her mandolin and wrapped it affectionately in its fur-lined shroud. Glancing briefly at the sunset, Minuet sped off in blur of light and sound, to the east.<br>

They read:*<br>
<br>
&quot;My story?  I am unsure of where to even begin such a task as telling my story.  For myself, it started many of your years ago, in a place I now find myself struggling to call home.  To start at the beginning would only lead to confusion and disbelief.  I am no bard, and I do not think I am capable of looking back on my life, then reciting it as epic poetry, a tale of intrigue and drama that no other story could hope to rival.<br>
<br>
I feel I must begin by informing you that I am not of your world.  I come from the place you would most likely refer to as ‘Heaven’ although we call it nothing of the sort.  I will keep this portion of the story as brief as I can, if only because my home is impossible to describe in mortal words.  Even if I could, it would take me years upon years to tell all I felt I needed to tell, as there are countless details within my story that I do not even touch upon here, all of which have impacted my life as much as any other.  But I should remain on my story as it relates to Norrath as much as possible.<br>
<br>
I was born many hundreds of your years ago.  A vast majority of my time was spent with either my best friend, Erollisi (who, upon arriving in Norrath I find is worshipped as a Goddess!  You can only imagine my surprise!) or my love, who’s mortal name is unknown to me.  A great deal of the time was also, not fully by my own choice, spent with the company of Mithaniel Marr. I do care about him because he is like a brother to myself… a very obnoxious brother that would like nothing more than to see me squirm.  Most of the time, he seemed to plan his evenings around pestering Erollisi and myself.  But still, I do love him as only a sister can.  I suppose there are few older brothers who did not act as he did while growing up.  He certainly has his good side, which is the side that his mortal followers know. However, I find it difficult to deal with those who would worship him!  I do not mean offense against his followers when my tongue gets sharp after I have been ‘Given the blessings of Mithaniel Marr and his eternal protection’ but knowing he is worshipped as a God… disturbs me.  How would you feel to know that your bully of an older brother is worshipped by hundreds of thousands?!  Having been forced to grow up with him has skewed my perspective.  As grand and honorable as he was in your land, I can still see him hiding in the bushes throwing mud balls and Erollisi and myself while we lay on our backs admiring the sunset.  As I said, my feelings on the matter are biased having known him as a child, so you may pay them little mind.<br>
<br>
I am sorry, I have become sidetracked.  I only wished to clear up a few misconceptions regarding my feelings for Mithaniel that I have come across in my travels.  I shall return to relating my story to Norrath.  Your land was mythical to us, much like mine is to you.  I knew few of my kind who had ever had such a grand adventure as to travel to your world, but one I knew quite well was Mithaniel.  He, I strongly assume, is the reason Erollisi is known to Norrath.  (She will be most displeased with him when she finds out!)  Mithaniel returned to us with the stories I touched upon earlier.  Stories of adventures to scourge evil from the land, sacrifices made for the well being of others, and the beautiful loves that can only be read about in faerie tales!  ‘Such an interesting place this Norrath must be!’ I thought to myself.<br>
<br>
My love thought the same.  Mithaniel, being much older than the rest of us, returned to your lands again and again. At the time, my kind was not unaccustomed to taking the form of a mortal and descending to Norrath (Although it was not very common.  As I said, I knew few who had done so.  Becoming mortal is a skill that requires such precision that very few of my kind have mastered it, and finding a… ‘Priest’ who can perform such a task can be difficult for most of us.)  He would take the physical form of a mortal while retaining his ‘Angelic’ qualities.  (Again, ‘Angel’ is a word that I find best fits what a mortal would call us.  It is not a very accurate term.) <br>
<br>
Mithaniel’s deeds of valor in defense of the land became legendary, and he soon had several others who wished to venture to Norrath to do battle with the forces of evil.  One of those several was my love.  To enter your lands, we must, as I briefly mentioned earlier, temporarily give up our immortal bodies.  We must leave our bodies behind in Heaven and become, in essence, a mortal.  We must be reborn, although this birth requires no mother.  The priest can fashion a mortal body and allow our spirits to enter.  This body begins as all others, as a small child.  When our spirit returns to heaven, the mortal body dies, therefore every return trip to your land must start as a child again.  (Although I have heard rumors that our leaders know of ways to return to your land at any time in any form, and I certainly do not doubt them.  Our leaders and those close to them are quite powerful indeed!)<br>
<br>
But I stray from how this relates to me.  My love wished to share in the adventures of your land.  I begged for him to stay, and the amount of tears I cried over the matter could have flooded the Plains of Karana!  But he had made up his mind.  He, along with the others, were to go to Norrath and purge the lands of evil.  They found a priest who agreed to give them mortal bodies.  The ‘Priest’ was quite well respected for his ability to send multiple spirits at once.<br>
<br>
But all did not go well.  I cannot pretend to understand the procedure and all that went wrong, but I know, in the heat the chaos, the priest and his assistants were in a panic to either pull spirits back into their rightful bodies or quickly force them into their mortal forms.  This was done, as was explained to me, to prevent any of the spirits from becoming lost.  The mortal bodies were scattered across your lands in the confusion, as their location was irrelevant next to the need to force the spirit in.  It took several of your years to sort through the mess, during which time our leaders banned the practice of becoming mortal without their direct permission.  We waited for each of the forced mortals to become an age in which they were mature enough to fully understand what they truly were.  These angels, after this epiphany, simply returned to Heaven.  In the end, all were accounted for… all save one; my love.<br>
<br>
I was told his spirit was one of those forced into a mortal body, except his body had not fully developed into what we need; a mortal body with a few ‘alterations’ making it capable of comprehending an angel’s memory.  Without such, an angel, as had been theorized at the time, would simply forget what they were, and believe themselves to be mortal. The body would be strong enough to reject the incomprehensible information, but not yet strong enough to accept it.  This is what happened with my love.  He would never reach the age of remembrance.  He would never be able to contact Heaven on his own.  He would live as a mortal… and die as one.  They assured me there was a ‘chance’ his spirit would, upon his death, be able to return to his immortal body and live as the angel I knew again.  But this is still unknown.  The land was searched for him, in the hopes that he could be found, but those hopes proved to be in vain.  He was now indistinguishable from any other mortal.  We knew not his appearance, his voice, his name. <br>
<br>
They eventually gave up their search.  I however, did not.  I pleaded to the leaders to allow me to become mortal so I may search for him.  I was quickly rejected… but Tunare took me aside and sympathized with my situation.  It was she who sent my spirit into this mortal body. (Although Erollisi gave me my name!)  I was warned however, and that warning implanted into my mortal soul.  Although it embarrasses me to say such, my voice is recognized throughout Heaven.  Unimaginable beauty they say.  (I do not say.  I think I only sound like me, which I figure to be quite normal.)  For a fellow angel to say such is exceptional compliment though.  As a mortal mind is incapable of understanding the thoughts and memories of an angel, a mortal mind, I am told, is incapable of comprehending the immeasurable beauty within my voice.  To hear such beauty, I am told, would be equivalent to a mortal seeing Heaven.  This, to put it simply, is not possible.  It would result in immediate death for the mortal.  The mortal mind cannot handle such an overload of emotion.<br>
<br>
Because of this, I find myself unable to speak with anyone in Norrath.  My body was formed to be acceptable to a mortal’s comprehension, but to alter my voice would require altering my spirit, and that was a risk I could not even being to consider, and Tunare certainly would not have allowed it regardless!  My appearance is a simple mortal representation of my immortal body, and I was to be a High Elf of Felwithe.  However, for unknown reasons (My sister tells me it was my desire to begin searching for my love that caused me to wander away) I was found in Greater Faydark by a young Wood Elf known as Alyissa.  Alyissa was of eight years of age and already an adventurer at heart.  She frequently ran through the forest dreaming of grandeur.  I was raised with the family as their own, which is why I call her my sister.<br>
<br>
And that, I suppose, is my story.  I have been here for twenty-three of your years, during which time I do not have contact with Heaven.  I may go home once, and from then on, I shall never be allowed to return to Norrath.  A compromise Tunare was forced to make with the other leaders to allow me this chance.  I have lived at my home in Kelethin, learning the ways of the world until recently.  Now I find myself old enough, mature enough, and knowledgeable enough in your ways to truly begin my search.  Although, I must admit, I harbor a great deal of doubt, both concerning my ability to ever find my love, and my true feelings for him.  Even if I do find him, I am now unsure of what that may mean.  So many years of uncontrollable thoughts. Would he still love me?  Would I find him with another?  Would I still love him?  I cannot ever forget that he intended to come to Norrath at the price of breaking my heart and leaving me behind alone.&quot;<br>

<br>
Now, be honest. Why'd ye want to know that? More over, what makes ye think I'd tell ye the truth at all? Ye know what I do to make my livin', aye? But if ye're sure?<br>
<br>
All right then. Ye'll get a story. Some of it's hearsay from when I was too young to remember, and ye must keep in mind the barmaids and innkeeps of Freeport are nae too concerned with facts if they'll get in the way of a tale. But aye, pull up a seat and pour yerself a drink, ye great glutton for punishment, and I'll fill ye in on all the gossip.<br>
<br>
Mead? No? Dinnae look at me like that, the sand and seaweed wipes right off, it does. Sure I hauled the case up from a wreck on the seabed, but the bottles were sound and the price was right.<br>
<br>
Still no? All right, then. Yer loss.<br>
<br>
Now then, coming up on twenty years ago, there was one of the finest fishing vessels Freeport had ever seen, the Perdition's Twilight, and her captain was a man with rough hands and a good heart named Aurik Oarsbinder. Aurik and his crew fished the Ocean of Tears, most weeks, as the schools run fast there, and most years, a ship's nets are not long empty when dragged in those waters. But this autumn twenty years back? Prexus must have been stirring in his great briny bed beneath the waves, as something had chased nearly all the fish away, and the Twilight could barely pull in enough scales to feed her own crew, much less turn a profit on returnin' to Freeport.<br>
<br>
Aurik, though, was a canny man, and he had nae become a captain of his own ship without knowing a thing or two about fishin'. With the unseasonable warmth of that October, he guessed that the fish had gone north for more comfortable climes, and guessed right as well! No sooner had the Twilight spread her nets north of Faydwer than the fish began practically leaping onto the deck. The haul was so good that the crew decided to risk weathering the gathering storm for a few more hours before turning back, but alas the clouds carried no ordinary burden of rain.<br>
<br>
The tales still fly of that storm, that it was as if Karana and Solusek Ro had gotten into a great bloody brawl up in the heavens: a firestorm. Nae just thunder or rain poured down, but gouts of flame, leaping from cloud to cloud and licking hungrily at the distant wooded shores of Faydwer. The sailors stared horrified, until years of nautical instinct took over. They tried to draw in the sails, but too late; a finger of cloudflame had run its talon across the mainsail, and the fabric was burning now, a sheet of fire hovering over the boat. Aurik and his crew rushed to hack the burning sail free and succeeded before the fires reached the mast. The immediate danger was past, but now they were marooned, without hope to catch the wind when the skies cleared.<br>
<br>
The crew huddled below decks until the storm cleared an hour later, just as suddenly as it had appeared. They emerged to find the tide was carrying them for the shore, so they dropped anchor before the Twilight had herself an unpleasant encounter with the rocks, and took the shuttles in to shore. Aurik knew the elven town of Kelethin was somewhere nearby, but in the dense foliage of the Faydark, they soon became disoriented, and when night set in, they were thoroughly lost. Some fashioned torches from smoldering branches left to burn by the firestorm, and they continued on their uncertain path until Aurik spotted a greater fire burning in the distance.<br>
<br>
Believing salvation to be at hand, the crew cast off caution and rushed forward, thinking of elvish hospitality and fresh sailcloth for their crippled vessel. The fire soon burned low and vanished, however, and the men were left with fear creeping back into their hearts. Nevertheless, it was the only sign they had found, and so they kept up in that direction until they reached what had been the source of that fire just as dawn began to break: the remnants of a cottage in the woods, crumbled inward and still smoking from the fire that had consumed it. As their hearts began to fall further, the still dawn air was cut by a shrill wail from within the remnants of the cottage.<br>
<br>
Most of the crew edged backwards uneasily, but Aurik shoved his torch into the hands of a shipmate and rushed forward, diving through the ruined doorway and forcing his way through the glowing embers of what remained of the house's modest furnishings. The wailing was louder now, and as Aurik hefted shelves away from the husk of the cabin's stone fireplace, he grunted in surprise as two charred corpses were revealed bellow, both captured in their last moments of agony by the flame. For a mad moment, Aurik though it had been the corpses which wailed, but the he heard the cry again, beneath them, and gently eased their bodies aside to discover a thin little bairn with slightly pointed ears and his clothes and hair singed all away.<br>
<br>
Me. Covered in ash and cinders and bawling like a pierced orc, but hale and all in one piece.<br>
<br>
Aurik grabbed me up from that hearth and clutched me to his chest, then sprang back out of the cabin just as what remained of the chimney came crashing down on what remained of the two that must have been my parents. The rest of the crew were startled to see the baby in the hands of their captain, and gather around him asking if Aurik was alright and peering at me.<br>
<br>
&quot;A babe born of ash,&quot; muttered one of them, staring at my soot-covered face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; scoffed Aurik, and he wiped me clean as best he could, then wrapped me in his cape and cowl. Finally with a moment to spare, he turned me around to stare at him, and chuckled at the sight of my bluegreen eyes. &quot;Like me da's own likeness, he is,&quot; he said with a smile, and he named me Langrall then, after his own father.<br>
<br>
Wrapping me tighter and tucking me into his satchel, he led the others out again to continue the search for Kelethin, and in the growing daylight they fared much better. Kelethin welcomed the ragged crew and agreed to sell them the necessary sailcloth and escort them back to the Perdition's Twilight, but they would nae take me. I suppose this human's story of finding me in the woods rang a bit thin to them, and they were loathe to take in an unwanted bastard half-breed. Aurik, I think, was secretly relieved, as I believe even then he had his heart set on raising me himself.<br>
<br>
Once the Twilight was again rigged to sail, they set out home for Freeport, and Aurik brought me home to live with him and his young wife, Abigail. She looked after me kindly enough while he was away, but I dinnae think she had any great love for this foundling child, even then. I have vague memories of Aurik, though, and he was always kind to me when he was back in port. The time came, however, when the Perdition's Twilight didnae return to port. I was five, then. Word came that another firestorm had struck the Ocean of Tears, and this time the Twilight had nae been so lucky. None of her crew was ever found, and only one bit of her ever washed ashore that was recognizable.<br>
<br>
Abigail, in her grief, blamed me for the loss, and I suppose I cannae blame her. She cast me out, and I would have no doubt perished if the innkeeps and shop owners of East Freeport had nae cared so much for Aurik. They took me in for his sake, called me Ashborn 'cause of the tale of my finding, and passed me around between them to bear the burden better. An extra mouth is nae a welcome sight in the ports, but they managed. I heard later that Abigail had thrown herself into the sea in grief, the poor woman. I lived in taverns and on the docks this way until I was around ten years old and, on a lark, tried to swipe the purse of a Militia soldier. He was nae amused at my little jest, and would no doubt have dashed my little brains out upon the cobbles had good old Janam and Rebby nae been close by.<br>
<br>
Do ye know them, by the bye? They're members of the Tradesfolk of Freeport, and as fine a pair of Ne'er-do-wells as ye'll ever meet.<br>
<br>
Anyway, they smoothed the soldier's temper with a few coins, and herded me back to the Den under the docks of Freeport. They told Ellisi of the promise they had seen in my amateur attempts at pick pocketing, and soon I was trained up as one of the Tradesfolk. The salt in the blood of my adopted father had gotten into mine as well, though, and I also pulled in some honest living on the decks of Freeport's tradeships, traveling the seas abroad, but I always returned to my new family in the Den. I've a hammock of my own in one of the alcoves near the sea down there, and it's there more than anywhere where I can sleep as though I'm home.<br>
<br>
Well, there ye have it. The whole sordid lot. As I said, I cannae account for the first part of the story, as I was far too young to remember, but I will tell ye that the Perdition's Twilight did go down in the Ocean of Tears all those years ago, and there were two firestorms at just those times. Ye can check the charts in the port office yerself if ye dinnae believe me. I dinnae care much, meself; it makes a good story, aye, but I've found it makes more sense to ponder where ye're headed then where ye've been, if ye take my meaning.<br>
<br>
Especially in the cases when ye've got an irate crowd of merchants and militia members chasing ye, of course.<br>

Enjoying his newfound life of adventure, and trying to help out his friend Isyryell as much as possible<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DESCRIPTION</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Lyrian is a tall skinny high elf with light red hair.  He is a multi faceted individual, usually serious, but with a pronounced mischevious streak.  He sometimes pretends to be a fresh out of the tower schoolboy who talks a mile a minute in order to make people think he is harmless.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  BACKGROUND</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Lyrian is one of the few &quot;natural&quot; wizards in all of Norrath.  A &quot;natural&quot; wizard does not need to study and learn his magical powers, but rather is born with them, and as he grows in age, so too does his magical powers.  <br>
<br>
This allows him certain priviliages, like a heightened sense of awareness of how the world works, and a deep connection, almost a bond, with Norrath's magical energies.<br>
<br>
Lyrian's parents were very afraid of this rare gift given to their son, so they kept them secret from him, telling him he was just good at magic, and forcing him to study it long hours.  He spent most of his childhood indoors studying one thing or another.<br>
<br>
However, when Lyrian reached adulthood, his parents could not control his actions anymore, and he began to talk of adventuring and seeing the world.  Panicked, his parents arranged a marriage between him, and, a childhood playmate named Jelara.  <br>
<br>
Lyrian refused to marry Jelara, and on the day he was to be wed, instead left Felwithe, and hopped a boat to Freeport.  This infuriated both his parents, and his future in laws, as abandoning an arranged marriage is a grave insult to the honor of both families.<br>
<br>
Lyrian began his life of adventure, eventually running into The Clan of Brothers, who despite their better judgement, took him in as one of their own.  <br>
<br>
Lyrian's family, and family to be are decidedly not amused, and to this day will send members of the family to try to take, by any means neccisary, Lyrian back to Felwithe to be wed. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ulyrianthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lyrian the wizard</A> at: 3/13/02 12:34:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwyntercrystalbow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wynter Crystalbow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lorekeeper<br>Elder<br>The Drunken Philosopher</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#660000>(3/13/02 3:24:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: OOC - Character Backgrounds</span><hr size=1> (Well I was going to have a clever story here, but my creativity conked out earlier tonight, so I'll get around to writing it eventuall)<br>
<br>
Current Story:<br>
Qilae is searching for the meaning in her life in visions of what might have been, in the hope of finding her family or at least finding out things about them if they are no longer alive.<br>
<br>
Background:<br>
Qilae was raised as a novice in the Temple of Silence (tentatively placed somewhere on Odus).  Novitiates at the Temple are trained in philosophy and spirituality in near complete silence, the only exception being language classes, speech not being permitted anywhere else.  Almost to a child, novices are all orphans and are thus dependent on the Temple and swear oaths to remain tied to the Temple for all time.  Qilae was supposedly no exception, but she has had incredible curiosity all of her life.  She literally soaked up nearly all of the books the Temple had about philosophy at a young age.  Once, when cleaning a master's room, she found a small brass locket and something compelled her to take it.  The master was furious about its disappearance and had everyone search for it, but in particular questioned Qilae, even though he did not know she had been the one cleaning it that day.  Since then, Qilae believed that the locked, inscribed with the odd word 'Aiae'Azhu' had something to do with her past.<br>
<br>
When she was ten, her evident physical aptitude made the masters send her off to train with the Silent Fist Clan in Qeynos, even though she would have preferred to keep studying philosophy in the temple.  Years of physical, mental, and spiritual training have developed her into an intelligent, willful woman.  She still has strong interest in philosophy, but those same studies have given her a strong skepticism that the gods exist, and she looks for a meaning while seeking to prove her beliefs.  Her lifetime of unending discipline, however, has left her somewhat insecure about her social skills, and often seems extremely frivolous at times as she attempts to mask her personality and sometimes keeps aloof of even her best friend out of fear of her true self being rejected.  She still maintains frequent journeys back to the Temple to study and meditate, as is required of senior novices and student, but she is finding it more difficult as she searches her soul visions to trust her masters and remain true to her vows to the Temple. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bcircleofsisters.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bridh>Bridh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder<br>Troublemaker</span><br>  Posts: 422<br> <font color=#660000>(3/19/02 12:45:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Bridh's Info</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;ooc: don't I write enough to bore you all with?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Current Situation:<br>
<br>
Bridh had recently vanished for a number of weeks, only to be found skulking sullenly about Qeynos. The two half-elven children she had been rearing have been given to a young couple living within Surefall Glade to raise as their own, as one of the girls showed promise as a Druid, and the other a Scout. Bridh is still dealing with the seperation. She is a tad... moodier than usual.<br>
<br>
Description &amp; Personality Traits:<br>
<br>
Bridh is a slightly smaller half-elven woman of approximately twenty suns passed. Her hair is a darker shade of red, streaked with copper from her long hours in the beating sun. Her skin is rather tan, as she spends more time outside than most rogues, doing a good bit of travelling by foot. She can never seem to stay in one place for very long. Her eyes are a deep shade of an almost olive green. Those who have seen her out of her armor may have spied a long, deep, white set of scars on her left hip that appear to have been caused by animal claws of some kind. Her clothes and armor are kept rather obsessively clean. She fusses about her hands being dirty as well. It tends to bother her more than nearly anything else. She doesn't say a whole lot unless her buttons get pushed, and at that point ducking and running may be a very viable option. Those who spend any time with her, or get to pry into some of her background, know that she holds almost no racial or cultural biases. This can cause problems when dealing with races who outright hate each other for no reason beyond tradition. Bridh does, however, severely dislike the company of Human males. She has befriended a very rare few. For the most part, especially when dealing with Brothers, she bites her tongue, and nods and smiles. She will also happily go off into a long tangent about the evils of the Freeport Paladins of the Temple at any given opportunity. She generally cringes at the word &quot;Paladin&quot;. As above, nod and smile.<br>
<br>
Personal Public Background:<br>
<br>
For those who don't know her intimately, you would know that she has always lived in Freeport under the care of the Den Mistress, Elisi. She has always been a member of the Den there in very good standing. She has, since reaching her late teens and adulthood, been given more responsibility in the Den. Bridh does not talk about her parents or family, or her background for that matter, with people she doesn't know. If she does know you, and considers it any of your business, then you already know  And if you must know, asking around within the Sisters may get you some information as well (I think I spammed the RP board enough, no?)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uzindella.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zindella </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sister<br>Lessa's Drinking Buddy</span><br>  Posts: 326<br> <font color=#660000>(3/22/02 7:03:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Zindella's Info</span><hr size=1> Current story: <br>
<br>
Zindella has recently come out of the void that is between life and death. Formerly a half-elf bard, she must struggle with the huge body of a barbarian girl, and the  inability to sing. Without the production of music coming from  her voice, Zindella wonders why she was sent back to be a champion when she cannot do the things she could  to make things right with Norrath. Coming soon: Zindella's first encounter with the servants of Cazic-Thule, the god who imprisoned her for so long.<br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
What can be said about Zindella that isnt known? Typical barbarian who  has the mannerisms of a half-elf imitating a barbarian. Due to her adjusting to her new body and the effects of being imprisoned  in the void, she  once in a while stops,looking listless or even appearing to fade away for a short while. If this happens to often, she will usually call it a day and make camp. She tends to work alone in her young age, though she will never turn down the help of others if offered. And like a true northwoman, when she is relaxing, you will always find a drink in her hand.<br>
<br>
Background:<br>
<br>
Zindella was born a half-elf. She was the creation between a travelling wood-elf musician and a struggling human composer in Qeynos.  When Zindella was born, her father had become a well-known composer. In order to keep his good reputation as a well-repected figure in  the community, he struck a private deal with the corrupt guards of Qeynos to keep Zindella and her mother out of the city until one of them had died. <br>
<br>
So Zindella and her mother travelled from city to  city for years after that with the band of gypsys that her mother had travelled with for so many years. During the timewith the gypsies, Zindella had learned how to sing and play basic insturments.<br>
<br>
When Zindella had reached the ripe old age of 5 years, the caravan was crossing the frozen tundra of the Everfrost going towards Halas for a performance. Along the way, the caravan stopped to fill their water containers along the iced over river. During this stop, a band of snow orcs attacked the caravan. Zindella hid behind a rock,and watched as the orcs destroyed everyone and everything that was the caravan.<br>
<br>
Left alone, the child wandered for a few hours before passing out in the cold. She was found a few hours after that, blue and half-dead by Bandl McMerrin, Halas'  more famous guardsmen. He brought Zindella to his place in Halas, and laid her in his bed. The local Shaman placed spells on her to give her strength, but they assumed the worse and figured that Zindella would not survive the night. But during that night was the raid of the Sabretooth gnolls into Halas. Droves of gnolls came into Halas trying to slaughter anything that moved. Many Northmen and women  died. As said by Bandl himself, everything was lost had it not been for one high pitched note that emitted from his home. The sung note stopped the dogs in their tracks, many dropping from the mere sound of the note. The others scurried back to Blakcburrow.  Halas was saved, according to Bandl, by a half dead girl.<br>
<br>
The years passed. Bandl had taken Zindella in as his own. When she had reached the age of 16, she travelled back to Qeynos and tried to enter the League of the Antonican bards. The guildmaster laughed at her, and sent her on her way. Zindella then started out, but then turned, and sang a high note which knocked the guildmaster on his rump. From there on, the bards were accpeting of her.<br>
<br>
After Zindella had reached her 10th concerto,  she travelled to the Lavastorm mountains. She had encounters  with undead and the Drow before, but there was a  legion  of them  attacking about 50 adventurerers from Freeport. Zindella started to sing, and the drow and undead were stunned. This allowed the humans  to escape. But one stopped to urge her to flee. This caused Zindella to lose her concentration. Knowing that the evil would be mad at letting their prey escape, she told the human to run. Then she awaited the evil, and their came with vengful fury. they quickly sliced down Zindella. But as soon as she hit the ground she dissolved into a purple  light, which in turn spread out and disentegrated all the evil.<br>
<br>
Zindella's soul found itself in darkness of the in between place of the netherworld and Norrath,also known as the void. It was revealed to her that there were differnet plans for her then to be a singer. She was to be the champion against  what her heart felt was evil. But when asked if she was ready to go back to Norrath, she was imprisoned.<br>
<br>
After what could have been eons (/ooc ok so it  was just 2 months,it just seemed  like  it), she tricked the voice that had imprisoned her into giving out who he was and weaken the imprisonment enough for her to escape. After finding  out  that it was a minion of Cazic Thule, she knew if she were to get back to Norrath,  she was to  be one of the ones to thwart most of his plans. She escaped by two  means, help  from  a minion of the Tribunal,and an ancient barbarian ritual,  with the help of a human cleric (which really has never been exposed that it was Nysa, I dont think she even knows <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). She had entered into a barbarian female, destined to be a masterof weapons for the fight against Cazic-Thule. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=20371A><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukallisiafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kallisia FV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#660000>(6/5/02 7:45:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fcircleofsistersfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.google.com/images?q=tbn:aUIeNP7ROJMC:www.santharia.com/team/forum WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Kallisia's Background</span><hr size=1> (This is a link to my journal/diary <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="HTTP://Kallisia.tripod.com">Kallisia.tripod.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) <p>___________________<BR>

<br>
Tae house was always warm and smoky and smelled strong of tae hides that me Da was curing in tae roof.  It was always cold outside, so I dinna worried about tae smell.  Better tae stink than tae freeze.<br>
<br>
Tae family always tried tae leave me behind when tae went out hunting, but I got easy bored in tae house and went out after them.  Da got tae idea that I was nae going tae be left behind, after I got lost once in tae snow following after him and Jamie.  I got a good hiding when he finally found me.  <br>
<br>
But he let me come along after that, so long as I kept away from tae polar bears, when tae others moved in fer tae kill.  Da learned fast that I was good at finding tae polar bear cubs, which have tae best hides.  I could almost smell tae wee things.  I think it was tae first glimmers of my magic coming through.<br>
<br>
I was ten summers old when tae ice goblins came.  I woke up in tae night tae find tae house on fire, and I ran, so I did.  Jamie bundled me out of tae window and yelled at me tae hide in tae canyons.  I ran and ran and hid in a snowdrift until tae morning came.  I'd nae been so cold in all my life.

Da had no brothers or sisters and so I had nae family or clan tae look after me.  Tae McRothes gave me tae the Shamans in Halas, as they didnae want another mouth tae feed.  I think they thought I was too small, or summin, tae be of use tae them.<br>
<br>
I didnae like my time in Halas.  The shamans are fair strict in their instruction.  My magic blossomed and grew and I was pleased with myself, but they always had more fer me tae do.  Old Heather McPherson, who was supposed  tae instruct me, called me arrogant and puffed up with pride and many's tae time I had tae scrub tae floor or wash out tae pots because she didnae like summin I did.<br>
<br>
Tae taught me tae read, taught me of tae Tribunal and their laws and a little of fighting.  I enjoyed tae fighting.  I reckon I'd be a better warrior than shaman, maybe, but magics a great thing tae be sure.  Tae spirits of tae land talk to ye and tae very wind and ice of tae Everfrost ye can bend tae your command !<br>
<br>
As soon as I reached my eighteenth summer and tae Shamans would let me go, I left Halas.  Now I'm wandering about Norrath, as a journeywoman shamaness, seeking adventure.  Heather McPherson told me nae good would come of this and I'd better stay in Halas instead, but what does that dried up stay at home know of anything ?<br>

Most had already gone to bed, indeed it was early morning already and the sun had been invisible for many hours.<br>
<br>
Soyin crept into the hall (as she usually does) to find a single candle burning, casting its guttering yellow light throughout the room creating evil shadows dancing from table to table, chair to chair.<br>
<br>
Thinking this was a bit odd, Soyin moved towards the candle, meaning to extinguish it before retiring to her room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soyin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Soyin jumped, then cursed the Gods silently, not liking to be caught unawares. Being surprised in such a way was detrimental to her health with the shady path she had chosen for herself. Looking over her shoulder, she relized she was indeed not alone, and that the bard Kristyl was seated in a dark corner in the back of the hall.<br>
<br>
Looking closer as she approached Kris's table, she noticed the pain evident on her young Sister's face. She had also been crying at some time recently, with red eyes and the paths of dried tears still evident. Even her hair, which normally seemed a vibrant gold seemed to be somehow subdued, and the clever grin was missing from her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kristyl girl, whatever is the matter?&quot; Soyin asked, her voice full of concern.<br>
<br>
Kristyl looked down at her gnomish sister and a smile temporarily crossed her face. She loved Soyin very much, she was one of the first Sisters she had met. It has been some time since their first introductions by that underground lake near the Hole on Odus.<br>
<br>
&quot;Today is my Mother's birthday.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You must miss her very much, does she live far away?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not far at all Soyin, for I carry her very close to me. In my heart, my mind and my very soul. She died two years ago this past winter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my, Kris I'm so sorry....&quot;<br>
<br>
Kristyl raised her hand, &quot;No no Soyin, pay it no mind. How could you know? I've never spoken of her or anything about me before, not to anyone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Soyin nodded, &quot;She must have been a wonderful person.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again Kristyl smiled at her friend, nodding her head and wiping new tears from her green eyes. Then softly, at first almost inaudibly, Kristyl began to sing. The sound began to grow in volume and texture until Soyin was amazed. <br>
<br>
She had experienced bardic magic several times over the years, but she found herself being assaulted by the power and emotion coming from this young woman's voice.<br>
<br>
She could see in her mind’s eye a human woman, slender of build but very tall, with dark eyes and flowing blonde hair. She was very beautiful and Soyin felt some of the pain that Kristyl was feeling. Then there was another in the vision, a wood elf from the look of him she thought. A proud young elf with chestnut hair and green eyes. He was quite muscular for an elf, and Soyin realized that this must be Kristyl’s Father. <br>
<br>
The song continued, at Soyin almost laughed in spite of herself when she saw a gangly adolescent Kristyl, smiling shyly at her father. It appeared that she was unaccustomed to the body she wore, moving without the grace and confidence that she has now. What made it easy to identify as her Sister was the impish grin that never left her face, and the blonde curls that acted likewise, refusing to be tucked out of the way.<br>
<br>
Images passed in front of Soyin’s eyes. Of Kristyl walking the streets (of Freeport?) and spending time with her family in some nearby forrest. Then there was a boat, no wait, several boats. It was on these vessels that Kristyl’s family approached a foreign shore while torrents of rain beat down upon them from a dark grey sky. On that shore Kristyl’s family and the other elves began construction of an outpost, but Soyin then watched in horror as the many of the elves were cut down by wave after wave of drachnid and sarnak.<br>
<br>
“Soyin.”<br>
<br>
Soyin came out of the spell that Kristyl had weaved.<br>
<br>
“My father volunteered to lead his people to establish the outpost now known as Firiona Vie. He was a great man, but not great enough to endure was he was forced to face on those foreign shores. I don’t think any man or woman was. I was only seven when the spiders came. My father fought bravely I am told, but…I never saw him again of course.”<br>
<br>
Kristyl sighed and fixed her eyes on the distant candle, it’s light reflecting in her eyes. “My Mother and I stayed for a while, helped where we could but I don’t think that she was comfortable among my Father’s people without him around to support her so we returned to her home, to Freeport. She spent the rest of her days there spreading the word of the Goddess, teaching me to help others as she did.”<br>
<br>
Kristyl paused, then looked again at Soyin. “The pain I felt from the loss of my Father, and then the inevitable loss of my Mother caused me great pain as you could imagine.”<br>
<br>
Soyin nodded.<br>
<br>
“I found that the only way I could live with this pain was through poetry…song…dance. To totally lose myself in it. To forget even who I was, even if I eventually had to return to the pain. My actions soon brought notice from the Bards of Antonnica, and even though I was never an even-tempered young bard I found that this was what I was meant to do, meant to be, and they welcomed me with open arms. Just before my Mother’s death she asked if I would continue her work, to continue to spread the word of Erollisi Marr. I told her I would of course, I would have agreed to anything because she meant everything to me.”<br>
<br>
“However, as you know, I am no Priestess. I think the Goddess would have fallen from the Heavens laughing hysterically had I decided to try.” Kristyl grinned her familiar grin. “So I chose to spread Her word my way. With song. It was only recently that I found that music had other uses besides enjoyment and art, much to my chagrin I found that music could even be used to harm others. And though I detest doing so, I have done it on occasion to those who deserve it.”<br>
<br>
Kristyl looked down on Soyin, and noticed that her poor Sister’s eyes were nearly black from lack of sleep. She laughed, “Oh Soyin, you should have stopped me ages ago, the sun is coming up.”<br>
<br>
Soyin glanced out the window and noticed that this was true, even the candle had burned itself out, how long had this bard had her under the spell of music?<br>
<br>
“Off to bed with you,” Kristyl scolded, “I’ll bother you no more. Besides, I have to get going, whenever I’m in town on a Sunday, I like to offer my voice to the Goddess for the day.”<br>
<br>
Kristyl stood up, and after trying to straighten out her hair and clothing turned back to Soyin. <br>
<br>
“Well, how do I look?” she laughed. “Horrid I know, but I’m off none the less. And Soyin, thank you for listening, you have helped me much this day.”<br>
<br>
Before Soyin could even answer, Kristyl got down on one knee and gave her a big hug. And then she was gone, faster than lightning out the door. Soyin cringed as the door slammed shut behind her. Sighing, she shook her head and turned to head of to her room when she heard something drop to the floor behind her. Turning back she noticed that the doorknob had fallen off the door.<br>
<br>
She grinned to herself, “Arania’s not going to be too happy to find out Kristyl’s broken the door again.”<br>

He walks along speaking to a young Paladin… who is that?  I can’t see his face.  Father!  I scream out.  He looks in my direction, his eyes look so sad...  Do the gods taunt me?  How dare they!  I scream and fight my invisible bonds trying to reach my father.  Suddenly I see movement in the shadows.  No!  Oh no… Mithanial Marr!  No… The shadows move quickly, my father reacts as fast.  He pushes the young man into a dark nearby alley.  He turns to face his attackers drawing upon his flaming sword to show the face of his foes.  My voice dies in my throat as I watch the trap unfold.
