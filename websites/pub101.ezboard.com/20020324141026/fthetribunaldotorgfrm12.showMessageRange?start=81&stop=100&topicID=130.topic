Cogito, despite your name, you are a fucking idiot.  The psycho bitch didn't kill her kids because she was a Jesusfreak.  Nothing in the bible or christianity says you need to go out and drown your kids.  She killed her kids because she was insane.  After the columbine massacre and many other similar shootings, i didn't come here and mouth off about the fucking atheists going on killing sprees again.  You can blame christianity and christians for this, but you are just an ignorant piece of shit. <br>
You posted an inflamatory remark about religion on a flameboard, Yet you &quot;wouldn't normally get in anyone's face about their beliefs.&quot;<br>
Hypocrite.<br>

Heratio:<br>
&quot;Christianity today is absurd. Nothing but ceremonial nonsense.<br>
The average person today has no clue what they believe and why. They say they're &quot;christians&quot; just to have something to belong to. They couldn't care less about knowing what their religion actually taught, or about following the teachings, which is why so many people have a general distaste for christianity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow, 16 full years of wisdom all rolled in to 1 moronic statement.  Did your dad give you all these wonderfully false bits of nonesense?  Oops, NM that last part.  Some people may not understand every part of the bible and still be christians.  The Gospel is not hard at all to understand, and that is the only part that really matters.  For you to come here and tell people what the average christian believes is incredibly pretentious and incredibly ludicrous.  When you get out into the world,  and actually meet some Christians, your preconceptions will be shattered, if you actually open your eyes.<br>

&quot;What would happen if we had another civil war? Except this time it was all over america. Who would survive, the religious people or the people who just don't think about it? Both people would. The relgious people would be indoctrinated into their faith, serving the community with religious zeal. The others would survive because of their moral freedom and mobility...they can do what they must, while the religious people set limits.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl.  I'm sorry, the mind that came up with that nonesense is at least as fucked up as the wench who drowned her kids.<br>

&quot;How can you find the fucking body of Christ when he didnt even exist?! Find me he existed besides ramblings in a story book called the Bible&quot;<br>
There is plenty of non-biblical historical evidence of Christ.  If you actually knew what you were talking about or had any education on the subject, you would know this.  But you are another ignorant nobody spouting his opinion.<br>

There is no christian church you fucking idiot.  Christianity as a gategory of many many many churches.  The catholic church is corrupt.  There are other corrupt churches.  There are many, many, non corrupt churches which fall under christianity.  The fact that you are completely ignorant of the structure of the religion does little to lend weight to the rest of your argument. <br>

Silverlore:<br>
&quot;As for what you believe..belief is NEVER proof, you can have faith in any damn thing you choose but it doesn't make it real. &quot;<br>
Finally someone speaking from personal experience.  This little bitch ruined his life chasing a virtual woman around for years.  He had faith in his virtual love love, but it crushed him.  All you Christians should take silverlore's lesson to heart.<br>

The fact is quite a few of us know what the &quot;average christian&quot; believes, because they push it on us all the time. The &quot;average christian&quot; won't shut up til I kick them in the shins and call their mom a slut. The &quot;average christian&quot; needs to shut the hell up and realize that maybe I have studied the bible extensively and that is why I don't believe in it. If I wanted to hear I was going to hell, I would walk into a church, pull out my cock, slap jesus on the cross over the head with it, then continue to whack off and jizz on the altar. <br>
<br>
<br>
Where the hell did that come from? Oh yes, from the &quot;evil spawn directly from satan's loins&quot; that christ community church deemed me, a title that I wear with pride. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/udumai01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dumai01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hi, I'm Brad Majors</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/26/01 8:57:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fucking Jesusfreaks</span><hr size=1> What do you want me to rebutt Darqen?<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, and most of them are coming to light TWENTY OR MORE years after the actual incidents of abuse happened. Don't fucking bullshit around that the church didn't know EXACTLY was going on back then. There is only so much of it being uncovered now because the victims are actually coming forward. Many of them have had their lives destroyed by this shit. The christian church is so corrupt it's laughable, but i guess good little christian sheep don't see that.&quot;<br>
<br>
This whole comment is directed at the &quot;christian church&quot; which i'm afraid does not exist.  Are you making accusations about a specific incident or church?  I'm not sure what you are looking for.  I will respond point by point if you can restate that in a coherent, factual format, as opposed to the sweeping generalizations and lack of concrete icidents you seem to rely on. <br>
<br>
&quot;The fact is quite a few of us know what the &quot;average christian&quot; believes, because they push it on us all the time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Are you stupid camthan?  Do you have a disability which makes comprehension dificult?  My statement was in reply to Heratio's remark &quot;The average person today has no clue what they believe and why. They say they're &quot;christians&quot; just to have something to belong to.&quot;  The previous statement is completely untrue.  Your drivel is completely unrelated.  Perhaps after you calm down and mature beyond what appears to be a childish rebellion against your parent's church, you will be able to re-read and understand the flow of this conversation to such a point that you will be able to formulate a germane response.<br>

It merely means, I think. <br>
- The bible does say, in the case of Abraham, that he did need to kill his only son, on direct order from God. <br>
- I think you do not fully understand the meaning of the word hypocrite. It means to pretend to hold a view or an opinion -- in particular, virtuous ones -- which one does not. A preacher giving a sermon about the evils of prostitution, yet using their services – that would be hypocrisy. Speaking up about something that one has been silent about, is not hypocrisy. <br>
- Methologically = methodologically, misspelled.<br>
<br>
So what’s that, two counts of not understand the meaning of a simple word, one count of just plainly not knowing about one of the most important episode of the bible, yet calling me an idiot and an ignorant piece of shit. Heh. I’m not sure I should even bother replying to this. Oh yes and of course the final point, of pointing out a misspelling in my post, that’s always the mark of an intellectual high flyer.

I, and probably horatio, and many many others, have had these christians spew all this at us for years. Most of these people, notice I said most, are people showing off how christian they are, to make the other &quot;average christians&quot; like them think that they belong. In other words, person a shouts, 'You are going to hell because you don't go to church every single weekend' at person b so person c sees how christian they are, so person a can fit in with person c, and his other hooligans. Person a does not care whether person b is going to hell, or heaven, or if there is a hell or heaven, they just want person c to like them. Person c can also be replaced with god, because this person tends to think the only thing their god sees of them is their spouting mindless 'you are going to hell' remarks, their prayers, and their going to church. This is today's &quot;average christian&quot; <br>
<br>
As for rebelling against my parents church, they guided me when I was younger, but respected my choice to check out other religeons, and my choice to be agnostic, when I checked out as much as I possibly could, and decided that no religeon that I had found worked for me. <br>
<br>
As for my hatred for organized christianity, I helped to start a gay/straight alliance (read support group and OH MY GOD! I was the straight person in that equasion)  and had one church instruct their members to spit on me if they ever saw me. Other churches told their members that I was evil, spawn of satan, etc and they should avoid me at all costs. But what happened? All the &quot;average christians&quot; tried to be martyrs and attempted to befriend me and make me realize my wrongs, hate fags, etc. while they sacrificed themselves by not following what the church said, and talking to me. They would not stop the babbling about how god looks down upon people who agree that homosexuals are normal people, and I would burn in hell if I didn't repent now. What would they do if I tried to express my views? Not listen. A true christian knows that they always have things to learn.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucogito.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cogito</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lord of the Whacky Woondarland</span><br>  Posts: 422<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/26/01 9:52:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://server49.hypermart.net/voxton/flash/mouse.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fucking Jesusfreaks</span><hr size=1> Bah! <br>

<br>
Research before you make decisions pal. Life expectancy has been going up for quite some time now, ever since documented earliest records. (Most researchers don't consider the bible a historic document due to translation errors and a lack of consistancy...i.e. it was changed over time and isn't kept in its original form) Christianity belief has actually been FALLING the past couple years. The &quot;people living 996 years&quot; comes from a different calender and a different translation. Our years are not the same as their years.<br>
<br>
Of course if you read the Bible and truely believe it, it will make sense. If you truely believe in anything it will always make sense. The point where you stop asking questions about your faith and reality in general is the point where you are blinded. And its when you're blind to other people's faith when things get a little messy. <p><IMG SRC="http://jearomjasienta.homestead.com/files/jearompic2.gif" align=left><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=25986">Jearom Jasienta</a><BR><a href="http://www.eq-remnant.com">Remnants of The Tribunal</a><br>There was a soldier, a Scottish soldier<br>Who wandered far away and soldiered far away<br>There was none bolder, with good broad shoulder<br>He's fought in many a fray, and fought and won.<br>He'd seen the glory and told the story<br>Of battles glorious and deeds of goodness<br>But now he's sighing, his heart is crying<br>To leave these green hills of Tyrol.<br>Because these green hills are not highland hills<br>Or the island hills, they're not my land's hills<br>And fair as these green foreign hills may be<br>They are not the hills of home.<br><br><i>"The Green Hills of Tyrol,"</i> traditional Scottish song</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarnon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arnon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/26/01 12:28:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fucking Jesusfreaks</span><hr size=1> Who can answer the question what was the original sin ?<br>

<br>
I picked a little booklet up in the supermarket, it was a bible quiz thing. I don't know all the soap opera details of that book, so I'm really quite bad with such quizzes, but I surprised myself, and got a lot of them correct, until I got this question: <br>
<br>
What was the fruit did Adam and Eve eat to get thrown out of paradise? Was it, <br>
a) Apricot<br>
b) Pineapple<br>
c) Banana<br>
d) Apple<br>
<br>
And I thought, hahah cool, trick question, I like this! But when I looked up the answer, it said &quot;d) Apple&quot; <br>
<br>
The bible never say what fruit it was. It refers to it simply as &quot;fruit&quot;. The fruit from the tree of knowledge. <br>
<br>
There is something quite interesting about this episode, because if you view it symbolically, it describes how humans at this very moment separate themselves from the animals. They decide to eat from the tree of knowledge, so that they themselves take a step towards being gods. They are not gods, but they are no longer animals. One of the htings that eprate ourselves from animals, is that we are conscious of our selves. In fact, some significant Mormon leaders have gone as far as to state that Satan did a good deed, when he convinced Eve to eat from the tree. <br>
<br>
You know the word Lucifer? That aint the debil. Never been. The devil is never called that in the bible. The only use of that name, is for a king, the king of light (a human king, Babelonian Ithink), and the name has a female counterpart, although I don't know the history behind it -- but in Sweden there is a festival called something like St. Lucia, with chicks dressed in white, with a crown of burning candles on their head, around Christmas time. <br>
<br>
It's all mumbo jumbo, but occasionally, it's interesting mumbo-jumbo. <br>
