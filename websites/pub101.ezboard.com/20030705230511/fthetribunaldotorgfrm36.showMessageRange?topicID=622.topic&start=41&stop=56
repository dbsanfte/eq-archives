If you missed it, I'm sorry.  I'll try not to say things that will go over your head.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, your first response to my post lacked a point, or at least a relevant one.  I never claimed that Americans had a monopoly on truth.  What I implied was that the North Korean news agency has absolutely no interesting in reporting truth, but rather will say anything which might possibly serve their own ends.  That was my point, Loegan.  They are not incapable of truth, but any truth disseminated by them will be purely coincidental to their central mission, which is propoganda.<br>
<br>
If you want to claim that Fox News serves the same purpose in American, go ahead.  It's a fairly common claim, one which is hardly true by any stretch of the imagination, but by exaggeration your point is made.  If you are trying to claim that every media outlet in the U.S. is a government shill, and that it's all a huge conspiracy to sucker the American people into falling for Bush's War (tm), I'll sigh and stop taking you seriously.<br>
<br>
American media isn't always necessarily truthful or even intelligent in their reporting of news, and various stations have various slants to them (some being worse than others), but none of them blatantly subordinate honesty to propogandizing to anything near the degree of the state-controlled media of the world's harshest Communist dictatorship.<br>
<br>
Al-Jazeera?  The folks that refer to the 9/11 terrorists as &quot;martyrs&quot;, and have shown consistent anti-U.S. bias even when the evidence was against them?  Even the New York Times has been publishing stories about the good we've done in Iraq.  My comment was justified.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I have not defended U.S. media, except to point out the obvious fact that they are not instruments of the U.S. government.  Especially now that the government is Republican and generally conservative.<br>
<br>
I find it amusing that you spout nonsense about how I'm glued to FNC like a lobotomized monkey.  I've watched the news on TV once in the last six months, and that was on the first day of the war.  I switched between Fox News, CNN, and whatever else I could find because they all started to get boring.  Find another insult to sling at me; maybe one with a grain of truth would actually sting a little. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visveres.myguilds.com/sigs/caledhon.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caledhontelrana>Caledhon TelRana</A> at: 4/24/03 12:41:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=loeganwolfheart>Loegan Wolfheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Please do things my way, thx.</span><br>  Posts: 3214<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/24/03 12:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=622.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://loegan.homestead.com/files/rn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What I implied was that the North Korean news agency has absolutely no interesting in reporting truth, but rather will say anything which might possibly serve their own ends.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
True, but I think they can be trusted to give their own point of view. Or do you suggest that they are lying when they said that Bush's Axil of Evil speech trashed our diplomatic standing with them or that the only way they see to deter the US is to have a strong military?<br>
<br>
It may not be the way you would have chose to read the situation, but I believe their claim that they see it that way. God knows that if I was the ruler of any other country in the world right now, I would damn sure want a strong military and every weapon I could get my hands on, in hopes of keeping the US out of my back yard.<br>

<br>
KJI doesn't like to talk? Shiiiiit, he puts out 10x the rhetoric the US does. He reminds me of a Rumsfeld without teeth. He loves to use shock as a tool for getting what he wants... and it's about the only viable tool he has.<br>
<br>
NK is always talking, it's just that there is actually a reason to listen to them now. You seem to not realize that the only way to get attention in this world is to do something shocking. People just don't pay attention otherwise. That's why we hear this talk of nuclear war from a country who only has 2 bombs at most. They know they can't back it up, but the shock value gets attention focused on their problems that would otherwise be ignored.<br>
<br>
It's a big world with alot going on. Countries like NK and Palestine have to resort to dramatics to make a blip on the world radar screen. So while I take their rhetoric with a grain of salt due to that fact, I don't think that invalidates their opinion. <p><br><br><br>

BBC Chief Attacks U.S. Media War Coverage<br>
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. broadcasters' coverage of the Iraq war was so unquestioningly patriotic and so lacking in impartiality that it threatened the credibility of America's electronic media, the head of the BBC said on Thursday. <br>
<br>
&quot;Personally, I was shocked while in the United States by how unquestioning the broadcast news media was during this war,&quot; Dyke said in a speech at a University of London conference. <br>
<br>
&quot;If Iraq proved anything, it was that the BBC cannot afford to mix patriotism and journalism. This is happening in the United States and if it continues, will undermine the credibility of the U.S. electronic news media.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dyke said, &quot;For the health of our democracy, it's vital we don't follow the path of many American networks.&quot; <br>
<br>
U.S. broadcasters came under attack for &quot;cheerleading&quot; during the Iraq conflict, with what some critics saw as gung-ho reporting and flag-waving patriotism. In one example, a U.S. network described U.S. soldiers as &quot;heroes&quot; and &quot;liberators.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dyke suggested the problem stemmed from the recent fragmentation of media, with no single network having the clout to stand up to the U.S. government. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is particularly so since Sept. 11 when many U.S. networks wrapped themselves in the American flag and swapped impartiality for patriotism,&quot; Dyke said. <br>
<br>
Dyke defended the BBC in the face of accusations -- some from the British government -- that the broadcaster had been soft on Saddam Hussein's government. <br>
<br>
&quot;In times of war, British governments of every persuasion have sought to use the media to manage public opinion ... it's only a problem if the BBC caves in,&quot; Dyke said. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I love watching BBC.  And I also agree with him that American news coverages are anything but impartial or obejective.  Of course a lot of people around the world saw this long before this war ever came about.<br>

<br>
Translation -- They agree with MY views and the US media generally did not.<br>
<br>
Most accustions of slant or bias in the media come from when the media reports or says something that we don't agree with.  Liberals and conservatives, American's French and whatever nationality are all the same on this.  When the view expressed matches your belief  or postiton its &quot;fair and impartial&quot; but when they don't agree with you its &quot;biased and slanted&quot;<br>
<br>
This is where the &quot;liberal bias&quot; myth comes from as well as the love affair the right has with FOX news.  <br>

<br>
The BBC is one of the absolute worst networks on the air, in that regard.  So is CNN Worldwide.  They've both slanted disgustingly to the left, and it's really rather obvious.  Most American networks aren't as crass about it as they are, but its there in varying amounts.  Fox is one of the few that slants the other way.  I'd love one that just reports events, but that won't really happen, at least on TV imo.<br>

It is near impossible to not show some kind of bias as long as the news continues to be entertainment based, shooting for ratings more rather than integrity.<br>
<br>
Hell, look at the wars Fox, MSNBC and CNN have had with each other. Fox slams MSNBC for Arnett, MSNBC slams Fox for Jeraldo, CNN and MSNBC slam Fox for having reporters looting, MSNBC and Fox slam CNN for being soft on Iraq for 12 years....<br>
<br>
This is where capitolism fails miserably. As long as news organizations have to cater to a public with a short attention span who feels being entertained is more important than being informed, we will only see the stories &quot;sexy&quot; enough for public consumption.<br>

<br>
I use Google News every day because if I read a story, I read it from at least 5 sources whenever I can. You would be surprised at the details one source prints that another doesn't. Alot of times you can see a 15 paragraph story reduced to 3 pragraphs in another source and that can change the tone and slant of the story alot.<br>
