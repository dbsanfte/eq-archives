Not before, if you have never been there then you don't know Shit and your opinon is less then that of one who actully servers their country.  Now if you couldn't pass the ASVAB I will forgive you.  <br>
<br>
I don't know where some of you formulated your ideas about warfare but if need be I can point you to several hundred text books most military use for guidance.<br>
<br>
One of them - The Defense of Duffer's Drift<br>
<br>
This book is based on a young British Officer charged with defending a River Crossing during the Bore Wars in Africa.  He has a series of dreams about the difficulties surrounding the defense of a position.  As his dreams progress he tries different strategies with varying degrees of success, each time he dreams he has a greater level of success because he has learned several lessons from the previous dream.  Several things he learns are, 1) never put off building defenses until tomorrow, 2) observe your defenses from the enemies point of view, 3) the &quot;best&quot; position may not always be the correct position, 5) never allow unknown persons to view your defenses because they maybe sympathizers with your enemy, 6) use all available resources to the fullest, 7) Never outline your sentries by light, or a lot of noise, this will give away your position.  This book has been modeled as one of the best military books for over one hundred years.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Now as to these comments:<br>
<br>
&quot;There are treaties and alliances and stuff that were put in place after WW2 to stop someone from building up a military like Hitler did before WW2. Bin Laden can't do this because right when his military posed any threat to the US, we would intervene and stop it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Where the fuck did you pull this from?  Do you know how Hitler produced his Army?  Let me explain as you obviously never studied Military History.<br>
<br>
After WWI the German Republic was limited to the number of Military, the key to success was to Hand pick the best Officers and NCO's out of the exsisting Military.  What they did next was train each of these to work 3 levels above their current Rank.  They were Soilders - Obiedent to Orders and were not allowed to Vote or get involved in ANY politial party.  They Trained hard and took their jobs seriously.  When Hitler decided to expand his Armies he did so in under 2 years and with the expansion those Officers and NCO's moved up and influenced the new Corps, Some of which had LEGENDARY REPUTATIONS from WWI.  They praticed in Russia, Developed Tanks, Planes, Ships in RUSSIA, they taught Sniper schools there.  The German Air Force (Lufftwafe (sp)) and many Armor commanders learned tatics and War fare experiance during the Spanish Civil war.  That is how Hitler was effective in building a Massive Army so fast and efficently deployed to War in a matter of 2 years.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope you were laughing as you typed that. I invite you to look up the MANY estimates that were done, by both us and Japan, had we tried to siege their country to end the war, at the predicted loss of life using tactics and weaponry of the time. 100's of thousands. Many, MANY more than were killed by dropping both bombs, by many times over. Japan has said as much themselves. Japan openly stated that EVERYONE in the country was willing to take up arms and repel invasion, and we knew it. We may have eventually taken them and ended the war, but the casualties on both sides would have topped the entire casualty count for the entire rest of the war. It WAS a last ditch effort to end the war. Both sides have even admitted it probably SAVED lives over what was actually done.&quot;<br>
<br>
I saw someone post estements of 400,000 lives or so, now what is taught in Military War Colleges the numbers are closer to and estamated 1 million wounded/KIA for a full scale invasion of the Japanees Homeland, now you have to look at all the levels of people fighting here - Army, Marines, Navy, Army Air Corps - as well as the will power of the Japaneese civilian.  Orig Military numbers may have been 400,000 but when you look at what would have turned your average civilian into a guerila fighter.  Not to mention that Japan would have had time to pull back reenforcements from China, Korea, Indonesia.  When you add all these in as well, any Military stratigist will tell you the homeland defense is always the strongest becaue it is the heart of your Army, it embodies all that you fight for, all that your friends have died for, with rumors of Rape, murder and torture would you want to be taken alive?  I would fight to the last before this happend to me.  So before you go spouting shit might want to learn alittle about the topic at hand.<br>
<br>
Now another good book that would explaine some of what I was talking about you might want to check out - Iron Cross - it is a Biography on Erwin Rommel, who by many accounts was one of the greatest Generals who ever lived.  It was his tatics that brought Mechanized warfare to be what it is today.  Many of the mottos/traditions you read in this book still ring true with the best of units today, Rangers, SEAL's, Marines, ect....<br>
<br>
More?<br>
<br>
Please do ask, I have nothing better to do but to feed you filthy animals.<br>
<br>
Anyways, Terrorism is not how you fight a war but rather who you ask.  <br>
<br>
Hit and run tatics are used by all Military forces - It is a way of causing massive casualties to the enemy while taking few yourself.  Ole Bin has declared a &quot;Holy War&quot; and America Calls him Terrorist (I agree he is a Piece of Shit and ought to be killed but this statement is objective and true). <br>

He left Cuba around 1965 and went to Bolivia where he tried to gain peasant support for a revolution there, without much success.  He was executed in Bolivia in 1967 after being captured by the Bolivian Army with help from our own CIA.<br>
<br>
Shining Path was formed and led by Abimaul Guzman, a college professor in Peru in the late 60s.  So... NO.  El Che was never the leader of Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), nor was he ever even directly involved with them.<br>

<br>
/clap   So true.<br>
<br>
What I don't get is where some of you get the idea that there is a right or wrong way to fight a war.  Wars are dirty nasty affairs by their very nature.  I don't care how much you try to romanticize it and pretend that your side is fighting the good fight, it's still a brutal, atrocious act.  Wanna debate whether fighting is justified or necessary?  I'll agree there are times when fighting is unavoidable.  Diplomacy just doesn't work with everyone, so sometimes we have to fight.<br>
<br>
Regardless, when the time comes to start shooting, dropping bombs, etc... It's a bit late to be taking the high ground and pretending that when we shoot at them it's a manly thing to do and somehow noble.  It may be necessary to maintain our way of life, or our security, but it's still barbaric.<br>
<br>
Was it necessary for us to go into Afghanistan?  I think so.  Al Queda was a definate threat to the security of the USA.  Does that make it ok to kill civilians whether intentional or not?  Nope.  See above about how wars are anything but noble or honorable.  The objective is to get in, win the fights that need winning, and get the situation resolved ASAP so we can stop killing each other.  This whole, 'you cut my finger, so I should cut off both your hands you dirty fucking heathen' attitude is what causes what should be a localized war to escalate into a regional or even global war.  War shouldn't be fought for revenge.  Killing 10,000 Afghanis or nuking the entire middle east won't solve a thing.  Hence, why several people here have said that a war like this needs to have definate objectives and once those are achieved, we need to get the fuck out and move on.  <br>

Because alot of these people have grown up in the 'clean war' era. Desrt Storm gave alot of younger people a very tilted impression of war. It looked like a video game with all of our high tech weaponery.<br>
<br>
Then, by the time we got into the ground war, there was so little resistance (yes, there was pockets of intense exchanges, but they were few and far between) that it hardly resembled war at all.<br>
<br>
I mean... shit... how many causualties did we even incur during Desert Storm? I can't remember except that it was an extremely low number and friendly fire took out almost as much as enemy fire (read that as meaning low numbers, not a jab at the military). <p><br>

No mention of any particular kind of war fare in that description.  <br>

How old are you any way fifteen, because it's painfully obvious that you are extreemly unfamiliar with the way the world really works.  There are people in this world called fanatics.  These fanatics will literally do anything for their cause.  I know that may confuse you a little bit that someone would be willing to kill themselves for a cause you don't believe in, but get this, not everyone in the world believes the same way as everyone else. <br>
