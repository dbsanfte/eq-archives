As soon as that happens, all the guilds that didn't go through the nightmare of the VT key timesink (for bloody good reasons, like it being a massively boring pain in the ass), all those guilds will come to a screaming halt and there will be competition for the spawns that *can* be beaten without VT gear like you won't believe. If that blockage point is halfway through the &quot;linear&quot; zones, it will be horrible - if its closer to the end, like the last plane or two, it may be okay.<br>
<br>
And Thistle is right - if (as it seems) the &quot;keys&quot; to progress to the next zone come from the boss or final encouter of each zone, there will be shitfights of unparalleled magnitude. I really do hope they have some better ideas for the keys to each zone instead of the usual physical key that drops off a mob.<br>

<br>
Velious was the best expansion for raid stuff, hands down.  You can log on, find something to kill, kill it, and get loot.  There is no annoying camping of uber rare key pieces, just log in and kill.  Maybe some people actually like camping key pieces but I don't.  From what I've read the quest to get into VT is ridiculously difficult and to be honest, the loot isn't that good!  Ya of course it's better than NToV type stuff, but I can go right into NToV and get loot, I don't have to camp fuckin key pieces forever and die of boredom.  Emp/VT is a huge waste of time and I hope to skip it entirely. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/urynnia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rynnia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 826<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/02 3:56:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> What I understand, and have been told, of PoP is this:<br>
<br>
Example :  You have an encounter which needs to be beaten to acquire a key, or token or character flag so that you may enter the next &quot;plane&quot;<br>
<br>
Lets say this is a ring event, like the burrower parasite.<br>
<br>
Imagine what we currently have... a single ring event that can happen at a single time.  Only one guild can do burrower at once, and once they do it, it's down for XX days until another guild, or the same guild, can do it again.<br>
<br>
Now in PoP, from what I understand, is that there will be the ability to have SEVERAL of these encounters going on at once.   Think of Anarchy Online's &quot;missions&quot; where they are created based on demand.  Each encounter can function independantly of one another, but are the same in mechanics.<br>
<br>
No more waiting for XXXX to spawn so that you can progress.   Want to take the test to see if you can move on?  It's always available.<br>
<br>
As far as shit that drops &quot;loot,&quot;  I dunno how that works.  But as far as the progression side, it seems they have done away with the key camps, and allowed an automatic &quot;always available&quot; tiering system.<br>
<br>
Think of it like this.   Guild A does NTOV.  Guild B does AOW.  Guild B is one tier over Guild A.  (Don't flame me saying AOW is more than one tier above NTOV... stfu just making an example).   Now in current form if Guild A wants to try the AOW, they have to find it up, and they also have to blow the spawn a few times learning it.<br>
<br>
In PoP, you don't have this.    Guild A would not be in Guild B's region because they would not have passed the test to get into said region.  Their attempts to get into that region would not affect Guild B in the slightest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Less competition until Guild A is in Guild B's tier, at which point they clash.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately this doesn't seem to solve the whole issue of slumming that often happens when not enough targets are available.  (IE:  An NTOV capable guild offing Velk or Trak cuz &quot;there's nothing else up&quot;)  I've heard there are things to protect against that also... and perhaps the entirety of content is replicable in PoP on a guild basis... who knows what they are able to do ?  Anyone have firsthand info?  Cuz mine is all 2nd hand at the very least  : P<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;needing&quot; vex thall loot to do PoP stuff?  Did anyone &quot;need&quot; VP stuff to do Velious stuff?   What I have seen coming from VT are little bonuses... cool effects, some extra FT or a few extra HP and resists... nothing that can't be gotten elsewhere to a bit of a lesser degree.  Nobody is going to &quot;need&quot; FT 6 on an item.  The tools to progress through PoP will be in PoP just as the tools to progess through Velious were in Velious. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usorran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/02 5:54:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Planes of Power gonna solve the problem??</span><hr size=1> --Heh, this ended up being a long post, sorry --<br>
<br>
I *think* that the stuff in PoP similar to AO's missions, where the game spawns a separate area for each person doing a given mission/encounter only works for the single group type stuff Rynnia. I believe its an attempt to encourge 6-12 man raids without having to wait for respawns of mobs etc. All the major uber encounters/mobs will be of the traditional &quot;spawn once every x days&quot; type we are used to.<br>
<br>
I'm not suggesting you will need VT stuff to get started in PoP - not at all. What I am suggesting is that you will need VT stuff to take on some of PoP - using Luclin as an example - no one in their right mind would try mobs like AL, HP, Cursed, Emperor, Seru, etc without being pretty well stocked up on ToV N and ST items - its just the natural progression of needing better equipment to kill the tougher mobs. What I'm worrried about is that this barrier is going to be hit too early in PoP, meaning that half the zones will only be accessible to those who have VT gear. Normally this sort of requirement isn't an issue - it just lays out the path that guilds have to follow to progress from one encounter to the next. However, given that alot of guilds will be deterred from ever getting VT keys because of the timesinks, the usual progression of equipment may come off the tracks. Now, if the &quot;VT barrier&quot; in PoP is far enough in, it won't be a huge problem - there will be lots of zones with lots of encounters for all the guilds to spread around in. If the &quot;barrier&quot; is too early, there is going to be a huge pile up at that barrier.<br>
<br>
I agree to a certain extent that the loot to beat an expansion is available in the same expansion - the caveat I would add to this is that it takes alot longer if you only have acceess to that expansion's gear. For example, while VP loot was not needed to do well in Velious, those guilds that had VP gear got a huge headstart. The same with Luclin - although you don't need to have loot from ToV N to fight the top Luclin mobs, it will take alot longer for a guild to get equipped with good enough gear to take on the top SoL mobs if that guild is only hunting other, slightly less uber SoL mobs. Example - it would take many, many months to be able to gear up for AL/HP/Cursed if you are only getting loot from mobs like Fred, Greig, Rhag 1, Rhag 2, glyphed etc. Not saying it can't be done, however.<br>
<br>
Planar/god/dragon gear was the &quot;leg up&quot; into Kunark, VP was the &quot;leg up&quot; into Velious, ToV N was the &quot;leg up&quot; into Luclin and VT will be the &quot;leg up&quot; into Planes of Power. Sure, you don't *have* to follow these paths, but there's no denying that it takes alot longer to progress to the next &quot;level&quot; if you don't do these zones. And the more time you spend at a given level getting gear, the more time there is for the next rank of guilds to catch up and clog things up even more.<br>
<br>
In VT, there are two key equipment upgrades that will be the &quot;leg up&quot; into PoP. Firstly is all the &quot;Vengeance&quot; effects - there are attack boosts that range from +5 to +50. The interesting thing about these effects is that they all stack with each other, and *alot* of VT items have them. It's not inconceivable that a properly VT equipped melee could be looking at 150+ extra attack - that's huge. If the PoP mobs have the same sort of damage mitigation so many of the SoL uber mobs did, that extra attack could well make or break you in the top PoP encounters. Secondly is FT gear - FT is king for casters - with the exception of one or two Focus effects, there is no more useful stat on a piece of caster loot. Sure, there is FT available in encounters outside FT, but its the sheer amount of FT in VT that will again, make a big difference in PoP, where I am sure the uber encounters will get even longer, and FT becomes even more important. A guild with the majority of its casters at FT 10+ will have a massive advantage going into PoP.<br>

<br>
I would assume that mudflation is a very serious concern for them as they try to stretch out the content of a given expansion as long as possible while they frantically try to push the new expansion into the stores.<br>
<br>
I mean jeez, compare the best and the worst expansion:  Velious and Luclin.  Velious was very well planned out in terms of mob and faction progress and very well ramped up difficulty of Velious mobs.  The hardest mob was killed &quot;legitimately&quot; on 2 servers for the first time (veeshan &amp; nameless) the night before Luclin release.  The player progress in terms of power and ability was very well thought out.  Fast forward to Luclin, basically everything dies in first 2-3 months with exception of Seru and Emperor who dont die until around some time in April/May just because they are locked up behind artificial time sinks like key quests and bane weapons.  And this expansion was supposed to have lasted us 10 months until PoP?<br>
<br>
<br>
The thing is that we have reached a point where nothing will alleviate the crowding unless you introduce massive amounts of new content and you keep introducing it fast enough to keep ahead of player progress, not like Luclin where basically everything died and turned into a farm in the first 3 months.  RNG, SI, Transcended and AN will continue slowing each other down in N-ToV, Sleepers and looks like Ssra this fall (if they choose to go with that route).  If these 4 guilds ignore Ssra, then they will be slowing each other down in PoP while Comps and EV will just pull ahead farther and farther.  And that works out really well for Comps/EV as the tier 2 guilds continue to fight over scraps in N-ToV and leave Ssra to Comps/EV for the time being. <br>

In regards to Sleeper's Tomb.  You really cant compare ST keys to the assinine lucid shard camps for the VT keys or the camps for different pieces of VP key.

Should you not do something you enjoy just because someone is trying to convince you that what you're doing isn't &quot;normal&quot;?  If you've been playing basketball for 20 years, then someone comes out and says &quot;Basketball is for losers, and it wastes your life.  Theres so many other things you could be doing.&quot; is that acceptable?  Its the same thing.. its a hobby, and if someone enjoys it, you have no reason to fault them for it. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

<br>
And no, pop wont solve any problems.<br>
<br>
EV and Comps will still be ahead of everyone else, mainly because of time invested in luclin.<br>
<br>
Those guilds in the ntov rotation will go into luclin/pop in a worse situation then ev and comps did<br>
<br>
Those guilds not yet doing much tov stuff (this can include west/east for all i care) will probably not have much success in upper luclin/pop at all.<br>
<br>
Those guilds not doing any tov will probably not advance mych in pop/upper luclin.<br>
<br>
guilds with mass amounds of planar did much better in kunark, guilds with mass amounts of epics, trak, vs, vp did much better in velious, guilds with mass ntov and sleepers are doing much better in luclin.<br>
<br>
Notice the pattern, now extend it to pop.<br>
<br>
Guilds with luclin uber drops will have a huge advantage in pop. Guilds with vt drops will have an even larger one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Or everything could require 100 hours of camping exp mobs, and we could all be screwed. <br>
<br>
Either way, short answer is no <p><div align="center"><i>Play to win. Play to kick ass.
