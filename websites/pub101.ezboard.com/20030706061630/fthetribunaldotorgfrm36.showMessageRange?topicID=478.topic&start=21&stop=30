Lord knows, it'd take MONTHS to find some oil company willing to take over the oil production of Iraq.<br>
<br>
Sarcasm aside, if this had anything to do with disarming Saddam, they'd be letting the UN run its course, because there is simply no need to rush into this.  There is no clear and present danger currently.<br>
<br>
Why spend the money and soldier's lives (let alone the international repercussions) when there is no pressing need to disarm him RIGHT NOW?  They could leave inspectors in for a year if they wanted, he's obviously not going to pull off a mass-genocide or something while they're there.  <br>
<br>
I just don't see anything justifying a WAR right now, unless your end result is a takeover.  And if that's the end result, GREAT - go to it - but be prepared for the repercussions, and you better damn well make me rich and happy as a US Citizen for fronting this war.  If you make Enron2.0's executives rich and ensure campaign dollars at the cost of soldier's lives and my tax money, I won't be pleased.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that an ultrapowerful military taking over territories for its own personal gain against world opposition is going to STINK of Hitler to the europeans.  Don't think they won't unify quickly to prevent us from choosing our next rich target. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 706<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/12/03 8:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Don't worry about the EU... worry about China.

Yeah, like there was a clear and present danger just days before 9/11.  Look, you're working under the assumption that the US government is all powerful and all knowing.  Did you not learn from 911?  Did that day not kick you in the head and make you realize we aren't this big, untouchable nation?  I don't want to allow Iraq to grow into a clear and present danger.  Just how many North Koreas do we need?  Is it that you enjoy being held hostage to a regime of crazy fucks?  Just one of those nations isn't enough for you??<br>

<br>
I don't think anyone even in the Bush administration is saying that Iraq is a threat to our safety.  The terrorists have no government and are obviously a threat, but Saddam (for as much as he'd like to take a &quot;free punch&quot; at us) wouldn't dare, and as long as he's constantly scrambling to outrun the UN inspectors, he'd hardly be making progress on WMD development/deployment.<br>
<br>
With any luck, we'd kill enough time that he'd pay off his debts to France and then we would magically get UN support to remove his ass without causing our entire generation to pay the price for ruining our alliances. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>

What screws exactly?<br>
<br>
Sanctions - They are only starving the populace.<br>
<br>
Inspections - They haven't been active since 1995, and the only reason they are active now is because the US asked for readdress to the situation.<br>
<br>
So yes, I believe that Iraq, if left with just sanctions will in time produce a nuclear weapon.  I also believe that Iraq currently possess WMDs, other than a nuclear weapon, right now.<br>
<br>
I also won't be placing any bets on what Saddam will or won't dare to do.  He's already shown to be unreliable when it comes to the safety of other's lives. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

China blocking major-power UN meeting on N. Korea<br>
<br>
By Irwin Arieff<br>
<br>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Reuters) - China on Thursday acknowledged blocking major powers from discussing the North Korea crisis at the United Nations, saying it was pushing instead for a dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang.<br>
<br>
Council diplomats said the United States, backed by France and Britain, has been pressing for the Security Council's five permanent members to get together to draft a council statement condemning North Korea for failing to meet its international obligations to prevent the spread of nuclear arms.<br>
<br>
However China has objected to such a meeting, the diplomats said. The 15-nation council's permanent members are the United States, France, Britain, Russia and China.<br>
<br>
China's U.N. Ambassador, Wang Yingfan, said Beijing was blocking a meeting because it believed a solution lay in head-to-head talks between Washington and Pyongyang rather than in the Security Council.<br>
<br>
&quot;We do see the possibility that we could bring the parties together. We just wish to have a dialogue,&quot; Wang told reporters.<br>
<br>
North Korea has in recent months triggered a confrontation with Washington by taking a series of steps apparently aimed at reviving its mothballed nuclear weapons program.<br>
<br>
It has become the first country to pull out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, kicked out U.N. inspectors and shut down U.N. surveillance cameras at its Yongbyon nuclear facilities, capable of producing plutonium for nuclear bombs.<br>
<br>
The United States has called for international pressure to convince North Korea to reverse these steps and again adhere to its nonproliferation requirements. It wants the Security Council to issue a statement criticizing Pyongyang and urging it to come back into compliance, diplomats said.<br>
<br>
But North Korea says the crisis can be resolved only through bilateral talks with Washington that would lead to a new nonaggression pact between the two nations.<br>
<br>
The crisis was referred to the Security Council last month by the governing board of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. The council has the power to punish nations for violating international treaties and U.N. rules aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.<br>
<br>
But North Korea has warned that it would view a decision by the council to punish it with economic sanctions as a &quot;declaration of war.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A> at: 3/13/03 12:58:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wenin>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read porn more<BR>
