To like-minded pedophiles, Dennis is a brave martyr who did what he wanted, successfully screwed the system for 11 years and went out in a blaze of publicity, facing his death with apparent courage.<br>

That was the Timothy McVeigh problem. It's the problem here, too. Personally I would much rather Dennis was a forgotten loser rotting in a prison cell for life, because then he wouldn't get this platform to speak to us, we wouldn't be reliving the horror of his crimes, and he wouldn't get the attention he clearly relished.

I think you basically have decided that capital punishment is wrong, wrong, wrong, no matter what the circumstances are. Your decision is purely emotional, and not rational. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it is emotionally irrational, in the sense that you have made your mind up about an issue that you have not been personally confronted with. <br>
<br>
If a sexual predator were to rape, torture, and kill your 7 year old daughter, would your opinion be the same? If no, then you are an armchair philosopher speaking about a topic that you have no idea how it affects people. If yes, well by God I am utterly amazed and impressed by your faith, and I bow to your will, because you are a stronger man than me. Stronger than 99% of this world's population. But I would still hold the opinion that such a man should be allowed to walk this earth no more. I've personally never been close to anything remotely as horrible as this, but I have -- as have many -- experienced violent crimes against myself and others, and I know that if any acts as violent and perverse as those be inflicted upon those I know and love, I'd be wanting the death penalty, and swift. <br>
<br>
Now, one thing about your mentioning of Timothy McVeigh truly indicates that you are not arguing from a logical, and sensible point of view... As much as McVeigh has harmed the militia movement, and as much of a moronic, illogical act of cowardice his was, he did it as a supposed act of political intent. Thus, he, or other retards may view him as a martyr. He isn't a martyr, but I can understand that a trailer-dwelling fucknut might view him as that. <br>
<br>
But in no manner could a childmolester be viewed as a martyr. That is SUCH a profoundly fucked up, dumbass analogy, it's downright aggrevating. I mean, sure, fine go ahead and argue against capital punishment, but don't come up with THAT lame an argument. A childmolesting serial killer is NOT a martyr. Cannot be viewed as a martyr. Ever. Not in any circumstances. <br>
<br>
Rapists and serial killers are at the bottom of the ladder in prisons -- except for the childmolester. Compared to the childmolester, they are kings and princes. <br>
<br>
Even the worst of the worst, view them as vermin that needs to be put down. <br>
<br>
Martyr, gimme a break! I don't mean to make this sound like a personal attack, but dude... Lemme say, I don't think you're an idiot, in fact from all your postings, I know you are an intelligent guy. But the idea that someone, anyone, would view a childmolester as a fucking martyr, that is an idiot idea. <br>

<br>
I really don't want to go into that topic because I find it too disturbing, but I once saw a documentary about the capture of a ring of hardcore child pornographers who kidnapped, abused and even murdered their victims. Police interviews with members of the ring were shown and they seriously believed the children were in love with them and society was at fault for not understanding. They recognised the murders were sad and it made them cry, but again they blamed society not themselves.<br>
<br>
If there are other people like that in the world, I think they would see them as martyrs. That's where I'm coming from -- I hope they don't exist, but I can imagine there are similar people who would blame the whole thing on society's failure to understand &quot;man-child relationships&quot;. I compare this to the Timothy McVeigh case because there are people who believe his motives were right, but say his tactics were wrong.<br>
<br>
As for your scenario of my daughter being murdered, I don't know how irrationally I would act because I would be a man destroyed. But I would hope to follow the example of Bud Welch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/utrindletrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trindle Trueheart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/20/01 10:22:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: All right, Warden, let's do it.</span><hr size=1> Who cares what they say before they die.. <br>

Such events are horrific, I agree. But what's wrong with it, is not the penalty itself, but rather the process that surrounds it.

If my heart bleeds, it's because others have become so detached from reality.<br>
<br>
Often when I post here, people remember a thread where everyone was asked their political views and mine were different from most who posted. So please let me write a couple of wide-ranging paragraphs first, because others are reading it...<br>
<br>
I am an environmentalist. I care about life on this planet, and the earth itself. It breaks my heart that people can be offended by my views, because my motivations are positive -- I want to see things become better for everyone, instead of a greedy few. My philosophy is simply to put others ahead of myself and make sure they are OK. On my father's side I come from a long line of argumentative, opinionated people (lawyers, QCs) so it's natural for me to stand up for what I believe in.<br>
<br>
But when I answer political questions on these boards, I get people jumping up and down saying I represent everything that's wrong with society today. Apparently right-wing politics are the future. Woot, let's all heil Hitler (please note, this is not addressed to you Cogito, I deeply respect you and I'm not accusing you of being a Nazi, this is a general comment about the way my political views have been received in the past on Tribunal boards).<br>
<br>
It's irrational to dismiss my views as based on dumb emotion. I am an intelligent 31-year old with a university education, I've travelled to 24 countries, lived for a while in three of them, and once lived for 4 months in a tent in Eastern Europe. A lot has happened to me, and I've had to do plenty of thinking. I am a creative type (a writer) so yes my emotions run strong, but I am also practical when faced with tough situations (ever been alone on a plain in Poland with a bicycle with two flat tyres, no spare tubes, feral dogs lurking, one beer, and night falling?)<br>
<br>
Anyone who thinks my views are not well-formed is kidding themselves. The same goes for someone like Bud Welch -- one moment you're accusing me of never having thought about how I would feel if my daughter was murdered, and the next you're explaining away the thought processes of a man whose daughter was murdered.<br>
<br>
Bud Welch is an intelligent, mature man who initially supported the death penalty against Timothy McVeigh. He says he changed his mind because he realised his daughter would not have wanted her killer to die, because she was strongly opposed to that kind of thing. This brought him out of his vengeance period, which he has described as a sickness that happens to the families of victims.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the discussion Cogito, I'm sorry but I am unlikely to be around here much because I'm playing Anarchy Online instead of EverQuest.<br>
<br>

But it is not sensible to base one’s opinions on emotion alone, or to let emotions be the main motivation for our actions. That would not be justice. If emotion alone were to govern our actions, we’d shot people for breaking into our cars, shoot them for throwing a punch at us. Our emotions are not impartial. Our emotions are always self-righteous, and quite blind.  <br>
<br>
Not to sidetrack the issue, but a favorite of mine, with regards to emotion vs. logic, is the fruit bat and the baby seal. Baby seals are cute and cuddly, and seeing video recordings of people clubbing them to death, for their furs, dragging the lifeless bodies by their heads, where their pick-axe is impaled, with the mother seal following, whimpering haplessly – if that doesn’t just kill you, you have no heart. Bats on the other hand, are just plain ugly and creepy. Seals are plentiful, but fruit bats are dwindling in numbers (I believe I got this from Douglass Adams’ excellent “Last change to see”) and an important part of the eco system, and bad things are about to happen… Well, guess which one of these two creatures Brigitte Bardotte (sp) and Greenpeace decided to help? Survival of the cutest. And then you got Linda McCartney becoming a vegetarian because she happened to see some cute lambs, the day they had lamb chops for dinner… Well that’s my point: emotion isn’t necessarily bad per se, but it should not be the main source of motivation for our actions. <br>
<br>
Yes, this server is oddly right wing. I’m not sure if all servers are like this. Perhaps the “I am the captain of my soul, the master of my fate”-crew are naturally drawn to computer games such as these, where you have a great deal of control of what goes on… I dunno. At any rate, I’ve always viewed your opinions as interesting, and informative, if at times oddly negative. But I respect your opinions, and when I write to discuss them, I do not do so because I am angered that your views are different from mine. I do so, because I wish to learn what makes you hold such opinions – not because I want to change my own point of view (although I always accept that this is a possibility. I would be a hypocrite if I didn’t, I think), but because I can learn. And learning is always a good thing. <br>
<br>
If Bud Welch thinks the desire for vengeance is a decease, I think he is wrong. I mean, that is a fairly offensive thing to say… I accept that his way of dealing with it is different from others. Yet, I do not fully understand why he would be so keen that he should be left alive. Would he grieve, should this mass murderer die in an accident? Simply put, I can understand “No, you don’t have to kill him for my sake,” but I do not understand “Please, under no circumstances kill this man, he must live!” Simply put, if someone’s way of dealing with their grief, and healing, involves destroying a man who by his own grievous actions has rendered his life less than worthless – I am profoundly confused by the arrogance it takes, for a man to call such desires, a decease. <br>

<br>
I personally feel like a brutal murderer should be brutally murdered.  I also PERSONALLY know this is an OKAY way to feel but NOT an okay way to act.  It would make me no better than the murderer.  Vengeance is not an acceptable reason to kill.<br>
<br>
I do, however, support the death penalty in so much as it does not violate the 8th bill in the American constitution regarding cruel and unusual punishment.<br>
<br>
It's sad that some people NEED to be put to death, but I agree that in certain cases it is the only just thing to do.  Not as revenge, but as the Ultimate punishment for a wrong doing.  The deprivation of life.<br>
<br>
The American Declaration of Independance states the belief in the inalienable Human rights that we are all created with of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.  Not all of you are Americans, but this document is widely regarded as a master work, so I feel comfortable using it as a reference.<br>
<br>
Prison deprives you of Liberty and for the most part the Pursuit of Happiness.  When this isn't enough of a deterrent, then that third inalienable right is the only one left to hobble.<br>
<br>
To close, if a member of my family was raped, tortured, and killed by someone, I would want to personally spend DAYS torturing them beyond imagination before finally ruthlessly and mercilessly killing them.  This is why I'm glad that we have level headed people to keep this from happening. <br>
<br>
Emotion demands retribution.<br>
Wisdom demands justice. <p><center>
