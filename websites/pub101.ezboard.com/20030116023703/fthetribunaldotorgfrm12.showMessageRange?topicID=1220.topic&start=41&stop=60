Yes, America is one of the most enlightenend nations in the world, but yet a large majority of the US public doesn't know a lot about world around them.  How many of you Americans know the name of Canada's Prime Minister or where Bulgeria  is on a map?  It's your arrogance and ignorance that makes people hate the US, not the fact that the US is a super power.<br>
<br>
President Bush wants Canada, England, Germany, etc to help the US launch a war against Iraq, and yet he backstabs them by adding very high levels on imports  (40% on Canadian lumber, and 40% (I think) on British steel).  Thoses are just 2 examples of what the Bush administration has done to it's allies.  I can name more if you want, but more examples are not needed.<br>
<br>
<br>
The media is cheapening the memory of those who lost their lives on September 11th.  Pushing a product using 9/11 is not patriotic, it's greedy and uncaring.  I don't see any Memorial Day Barbies being sold at Toys R Us, so why is buying a collection of Martha Stewart 9/11 plates special?  Politicians are also dragging the memory of the victims throught the mud by using 9/11 to justify going to war against Iraq.  That's like saying &quot;I'm glad 3000+ people died.  Now I am justified to go kill people, civilians and military alike, in an other country for no other reason than to gain a few points in the polls&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Taliban have stabbed us in the heart.  We must now stand together, as people of the world, and put an end to hate.  Hate is what all this is about.  It's the foundation of war, and is fueled by ignorance.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Let's remember that 9/11 isn't just an American tragedy.  There were Canadian, English, Japanise, Arabian, and Germain victims who lost their lives in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. <p><center><img src="http://academic.algonquincollege.com/students/holm0056/vic_hob_sig.jpg">

I agree with Merton on the blind Americans.  I really can't stand seeing people talk about shit they don't know about.

And on Japan, and Vietnam *civilians shot in cold blood there also* was wrong.  We don't want our Civi's dead, why do that to another country?  It's the weakest tactic of war anyone could use, is killing it's civilians.

The CHILD civilian casualty alone (not including other civilian casualties) in Iraq from US bombing and depleted uranium gunshells was just over 1 million. ONE MILLION children dead from bombs or dying from radiation poisoning. The complete death toll stands at well over that. Where is Sadam now? Sitting comfortably on his throne.<br>
<br>
America to this day stands at being the only country to have ever deployed weapons of mass destruction on civilian targets<br>
and not once, no no because that wasnt enough, they dropped 3 on Japan. Civilian deathtoll was unprecented.<br>
<br>
America went to Vietnam and got its ass kicked but in the process killed an obscene number of people who were simply defending their land. And  Hollywood propganda will release movies claming the Americans were the hero's fighting for a just cause. Bullocks. Im just happy Vietnam served them a big fat fucking slap on the face.<br>
<br>
America supports and aids one of the biggest terrorists in the world - Israel which btw is responsible for the worst War Crimes in history you just dont hear about it because its not the Jews this time who are suffering. In the words of a Jewish newspaper editor  &quot;The Palestinians have become victims of the worlds biggest victims, indeed one would think the suffering that took place in WWII would have taught us better&quot; - Michael Rosenthal<br>
<br>
<br>
You can defend your country as much as you like but the fact remains that America parades as a peacemaker when it is the instigator of terror. Dont tell me &quot;when has America killed civilians...&quot; America is the biggest fucking terrorist on this Earth. <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=3333FF)"><a style="font-weight:bold; color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration: none" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75852>Lethys </a></div><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=3333FF)"><a style="font-weight:bold; color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration: none" href=http://www.eqcompanions.com/>The Companions</a></div>

<br>
With that, before even reading the responses since my last post (actually I wrote much of this before reading any responses) I've been thinking about the bombing of Japan.  This morning, a point came to me, that you failed to make clear (before your last post), though I'd always known it myself anyhow.  Til now, I hadn't placed enough emphasis on this point.<br>
<br>
The two atomic bombings of Japan, were terrorism.  They were, there is no doubt about this, and no one can argue against this fact.  Those bombings were meant to terrorize Japan into surrendering.  They were to show to Japan, that there is no doubt that they will not win that war.<br>
<br>
But you know what, I'll still stand by my stance that they were both justified.  That they are still different in many other ways from the attacks on 9/11.  I'll continue to stand by my belief that you're a close minded ass, that likes to run his mouth.<br>

If you are going to stick to your idea that the US engaged in terrorism with the two bombs, by bombing civi's...<br>
<br>
Add to your list then:<br>
<br>
Germany<br>
Britian<br>
Russia<br>
Italy<br>
Japan<br>
<br>
Don't shunt one aspect of the truth, to try to make yours look so overwhelmingly proper.  All of those powers during WWII bombed civi's.  So I guess everyone is a terrorist huh?<br>
<br>
Sash,<br>

It is people like you, that mock the people of the US, saying our hicks are dumb and dimwitted, and lack the brain power to add 2+2.  Fuck you for your assinine bullshit idea.  Fuck you for belittling a country that has done nothing but stood by as brothers in arms.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to go into the whole shit of if it weren't for the US, then Canada would be speaking Russian.  That's old, and just plain false.<br>
<br>
It bugs the shit out of me that so many people from outside my country bash, and belittle us, when they don't realize that it isn't us making the decisions to drop the bombs.  Just like the folks in Afgan, the public didn't make the decision to do what they did to the US, their fuckwad &quot;leaders&quot; did.<br>
<br>
As your whole cliche about the dumb hick from (insert southern state) don't know dis or dat...Fuck you.  No one thought we were electing Bush Sr.  And why didn't the world hear more about your Jean Chreatien (sp?) issues in years past, because pointedly, the world doesn't give a fuck about Canada.  They aren't in the forefront of world issues, like the big evil, will-imposing US is.<br>
<br>
Do I deny mistakes were made in the US's past, hell no.  Will I take any blame or slander for mistakes made before I was even fucking born?  Hmmm...no.  Go back to Saskatoon, SK and play with your fucking moose.<br>
<br>
Did Atom go off in a wrong way with his post?  Sure he did.  Is it people like him that hinder the &quot;melting pot&quot; that the US is?  Sure.  But maybe, just maybe did you think that he made an over zealous, and generalization about shit being pissed off?  12 Angry Men...&quot;I'll kill you&quot;...&quot;Do you really mean that?&quot;  Things said, can be taken anyway that the reader wants to, especially when read as text.<br>
<br>
And to whoever tried being the super hero about saying: I have Muslim friends, I'm good, give me pat on head...go outside and play hide the salami.  Good fucking for you that you have Muslim friends.  I do too...do I get a fucking lolipop now?<br>

<br>
And while your at it Cecel...why not talk about what the French did in there?  Oh right...cuz only the US is a target for your bullshit views.<br>

The media is cheapening the memory of those who lost their lives on September 11th. Pushing a product using 9/11 is not patriotic, it's greedy and uncaring. I don't see any Memorial Day Barbies being sold at Toys R Us, so why is buying a collection of Martha Stewart 9/11 plates special? Politicians are also dragging the memory of the victims throught the mud by using 9/11 to justify going to war against Iraq. That's like saying &quot;I'm glad 3000+ people died. Now I am justified to go kill people, civilians and military alike, in an other country for no other reason than to gain a few points in the polls&quot;.<br>

Using the phrase &quot;the media&quot; is a large brush stroke.  I think the news reports I saw yesturday were done tastefully.  I watched I believe ABC all night last night.  They did a minute by minute account of what was occurring within our government as it reacted to the acts.<br>
<br>
As for toys and other trinkets of crapola.  I agree with you 100%, a lot of that crap is just that, crap.  I can understand a T-Shirt, or pictures involving the event, but for any 99 cent crap toys they sell.  /shiver  Stuff disgusts me, but that's capitalism.  You can't blame anyone but those that make and buy that stuff, and since a large part of the populace does neither, I wouldn't knock an entire country for the practice.  Side question, is there a Barbie or a another major Toy manufacturer that has made memorial toys or crapola trinkets?  I havn't recalled seeing any.<br>
<br>
As for Iraq, the main sticking point is not 9/11, 9/11 has only sparked the fire.  The main sticking point for Iraq, is their support of terrorism, and their pursuit of making weapons of mass destruction.<br>
<br>
P.S.  They read the names of nearly 3000 people at the WTC yesturday.  That included all those that died, but were of a different nationality than US.  There were also several other memorials done yesturday that included all those that died. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ucecelsoulhealer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cecel Soulhealer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/02 6:08:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Venting.</span><hr size=1> Ahxxy, fuck you.

<br>
Fact: Hiroshima and Nagasaki were legitimate military targets.<br>
<br>
Hiroshima:<br>
<br>
Hiroshima was a city of considerable military importance. It contained the 2nd Army Headquarters, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan. The city was a communications center, a storage point, and an assembly area for troops. To quote a Japanese report, &quot;Probably more than a thousand times since the beginning of the war did the Hiroshima citizens see off with cries of 'Banzai' the troops leaving from the harbor.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nagasaki:<br>
<br>
The city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest sea ports in southern Japan and was of great war-time importance because of its many and varied industries, including the production of ordnance, ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The narrow long strip attacked was of particular importance because of its industries. <br>

<br>
Also, prior to the bombing of Nagasaki, leaflets were dropped warning the people to evacuate.  They were told by their government to ignore the propoganda, and the destruction of Hiroshima was downplayed by the government.<br>
<br>
All of you foreigners are also missing one important fact:<br>
<br>
1 American is worth more than any number of japanese/candians/iraqis/europeans/afghanis/etc.  You may not like that, but our leaders would be criminal in their disloyalty to the American people if they did not acknowledge and adhere to that notion.<br>
<br>
And Sashana, your heroic somalis were some cowardly bastards.  It was not uncommon in the firefight for somali soldiers to hide behind women and children.  A somali fighter would lay down and 4-5 children would sit on him.  Women would point out troop positions to somali men during the attack.  The firefight raged for most of the day.  No one in the region was a civilian, they were combatants.<br>
<br>
The United States is not perfect.  We have made mistakes in the past.  However, in World War II we were NOT the agressor.  The world has learned an important lesson from WWII and is relearning it now:  Don't Fuck with the United States.  You WILL lose, and lose badly.  It is a tragedy that the world so easily forgets, and that alot of people have died.  But the blame lies not with the United States, it lies with those who would mess with us.<br>

How is it ignorant?  What was the purpose of dropping a weapon of mass destruction on a large city that had absolutely little in the way to do with military installations if the intended target was not civilians?  If the intended purpose was to demonstrate the power of the weapon, why not drop it on a remote military installation?<br>
<br>
<br>
I also remember a less known bombing run on Dresden in 1945 that was using primarily incendiary bombs to torch down civilian homes.  The intended effect was to create massive firestorms to maximize casualty counts.  Death toll estimates range anywhere from 35,000-250,000 with most counts settling around 100,000 - 130,000 as the common accepted figure.  Terrorism?  Yeah, I'd say so, considering there wasnt much of a Germany left by that time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yet you would still defend it, by justifying it as war.  And that is what is truly sad.  You are a blind patriot.<br>

I already agree with you that the bombings were meant to be terroristic.  What you need to realize is that those cities weren't picked out of the blue.  They were picked for the military importance of those targets.  But again, I'll agree with you that the primary purpose of those bombings themselves were not for the military importance.  But also, nor were the primary purpose of those bombings to be the killing of the most civilians that we could.  Those two cities were actually some of the smallest in Japan.  If we had wanted to kill the most civilians, than we would have bombed Tokyo, or one of the other major cities.<br>
<br>
Flassh, you're right, they do feel that those attacks were justified.  I just happen to disagree.  Also, they aren't justifiying the WTC attacks the same as we justified the bombings of Japan.  The two attacks have two completely different reasons behind them, though they were both acts of terrorism. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094">Wenin Huirunda</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uwenin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 471<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/02 7:11:10 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.aradcliff.net/images/130.gif width=128 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
