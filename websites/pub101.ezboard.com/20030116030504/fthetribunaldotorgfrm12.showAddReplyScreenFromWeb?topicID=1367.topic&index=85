Wow nice twist, no I didnt mock Tanje, I expressed I was upset when I found out she was married almost 2 years ago because she is a sweetheart and I developed a crush on her.

HAHAHAHA, Omg what a unique spin, It was the &quot;MUSE&quot; pic that I told you she said looked manly because of the jawline, and you and I talked about when you were &quot;analyzing&quot; my artwork. My only qualm with calling Muse is she is long distance and I dont feel like burning up more cash on long distance bills, you see they became a problem when we dated. As for her being hot enough, I am sure there are plenty of guys who would agree Muse is a cutie, and I am one of them. Nice try though. Hell me and Muse discussed her pic also she also said the jawline was too strong.<br>

<br>
Yes I did see the situation was fucked up, especially from the way you told me the way the relationship was, cause you had the inside &quot;connection&quot; with Kennit whom you have claimed to have fucked during our relationship. What I gave her was gifts cause I had the ability to give it to her, and the time I spent with her was well worth it, as she is a sweet and wonderful person. Though you did obsess about her also, rambling on and on about her. You were so jealous of her, that you thought you were having a competition via ezboards, and you cried endlessly about all the &quot;friends&quot; who stopped hanging on the garden and went to her board.  <br>

My harem is great, filled with wonderfully sweet people who dont obesses over shit and bitch endlessly about their sucky lives like the posters at the garden. And it is roleplaying forum, as I am not really Risingfist nor Darkmask, a concept you dont seem to understand, and the women who post their dont actually want me, they are just playing along. Sadly you believed that the Harem was there for me to pick women out of, but it is there to have a good time posting silly shit. And I still roleplay in the Harem, but I dont have a &quot;need&quot; to post, but I enjoy doing it.<br>

As for her breasts, yeah god forbid she have a huge chest, MEN HATE THAT, I swear!!! Though you used to obesess about your chest, and how wonderful you thought it was, its not, you want wonderful, you should see these things...WOOT. So yeah keep flaming my girlfriend about her large chest, its such an insult....go you!!<br>

Actually though, shes not stupid, but I am lucky she is with me, I can agree she is dating way below her level by dating me, but I aint complaining, I got a hot wonderfully sweet chick with a great chest and ass....yeah listen to me bitch....HA. <br>

My first girlfriend?? Man do you really twist shit, that was Michelle, and she was not my first girlfriend, cause that sorta conflicts with the whole dating Kim through highschool whom you metion later in this post. The story was very simple, it wasnt plauge covered teeth, we were however at an amusment park and I had eaten some food, and true some of the food stayed between my teeth ( never happens to anyone else ) and I didnt know, and I told you she embarassed me by louding me out while waiting in a line for the cyclone, when she almost screamed &quot; You got stuff on your teeth &quot; which was very embarassing. I was in fact so embarassed though, that I did go get a cleaning the next week, to make sure my teeth were in the best condition for her cause I had been thinking how embarassing that was and maybe one day I will learn I dont need to please women, but that is the just the way I am. I want to make women happy, not my fault I had an impossible task in you, cause you can never be happy.<br>

Actually the story I told you was when me and Dafist were going back and forth on the EVboard, and I told you he was accussing me of flaming him because of the Emp Staff drop, and I explained to you that it was actually because I didnt like what he posted in the private monk board for EV monks. In fact this very issue can be confirmed by members of EV who read the post where I had to explain I wasnt upset about the Emp Staff but upset over the stupid post Dafist made. Very nice twist though, though if anyone knows, I really couldnt piss and moan about not getting the first emp staff, since I wasnt there, my computer had died to a virsus, so it was sorta impossible for me to even be on. I was extremely happy that is went to Paimae, hes a great monk.<br>

How so?? They didnt effect our relationship. You dont seem to understand that I left you not for them, but because of your temper and your yo yo love, always up and down, never know which it is gonna be from day to day. I also became bored listening to you drone on about yourself, you were so very selfish and self absorbed. Our relationship was already over, you dont understand that, I looked at you and didnt want to be with you. It wasnt that I wanted to be with someone more, its that I didnt want YOU. They had nothing to do with US, &quot;US&quot; was ruined already, I just tried give you the last benefit of the doubt when you told me you had all these relizations about yourself, where you said you started to understand why you did what you did and why. Though much like everything you seem to discover about yourself, it doesnt last long, this &quot;new&quot; Sharon you became, didnt last long, the same old Sharon came through and thats when I said, enough is enough.<br>
<br>
As for making a case? I am not making a case, we are not arguing this to decide a winner, you dont seem to understand that you moron, there will be no winner if we keep tearing into each with personal shit, and you keep lying, we both lose, this is not some fucking game were someone is gonna win and be declared a victor.....I am baffled by your lack of intelligence in this, that you dont realize that no one wins with the kinda games you want to play. Fucking grow up and be an adult Sharon, and next time if you want to twist my life, at least use shit people cannot double check, cause those examples are easily double checked and really expose you as the liar you are. This is a game to you, apparently you are doing what you can to be the victor, all I am saying is let it go, stop yanking me back into your fucked up life. This isnt a game and there is no victor from this kind of shit flinging.<br>
