And I don't like to pretend that I know more than I do, so lemme say, that this is just not-well informed speculation... <br><br>You may well be correct, that he needs to be part of an officially recognized government's army, in order to lose his citizenship. It does make sense. <br><br>My knee-jerk reaction was based on the fact that he was actively fighting US forces. Now, you could say that about protesters in the 60s. But in this case, US forces were engaged in combat, with an enemy. And the words of the law (as far as I remember) basically covered anyone who fought by their side -- even those who provided aid for them (which would cover medical aid, as far as I know. The exception of course is pows, and the main point about that situation, is that pows are no longer combatants). <br><br>That is of course, just speculation. <br><br>More speculation: I think that although there may be a legal case for removing his citizenship, it would quite simply seem a tad too draconian, to be honest. It'd be a bad PR situation, simply. In a country where free speach is such a profound, integral part of its fabric, I think this lunatic/asshole/traitor/fuck might be viewed -- today, or down the road -- as someone who simply protested his country's actions, and used his first amendment rights, although in an extreme way. The fact that there is no known evidence of him actually engaging in combat with US troops -- let alone killing anyone, as well as the fact that he was captured, would aid the 'pity' factor to his case. <br><br>So, although I'm sure there are a lot of mistakes made, the decision to not remove his citizenship MIGHT be a case of caution, and PR issues. <br><br>But i dunno.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uelcheproudfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elche Proudfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mmmmm lobster</span><br>  Posts: 500<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/12/02 6:31:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=97.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.about.com/specials/service/promotion/sod/male_lead_stealer/josh_ryan_evans.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Strange rules</span><hr size=1> so we should just return all the detainees who are citizens of other states? <p><font size="-2" face="verdana">Elche Proudfoot<BR><b>Founder and Chief Mystic</font><br><font color=red size="-2" face="verdana"> Shining Path</FONT></b> </FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/uarleanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arleanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Send me a tell in game!</span><br>  Posts: 222<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/12/02 12:00:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=97.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://people.ne.mediaone.net/pretzhere/EQ/Sphynx4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Strange rules</span><hr size=1> Good points.

This would essentially leave the individual stranded: he'd become an illegal alien, except there would be no homeland where he could be deported to. <br><br>However, the effect of such a &quot;homelessness&quot; would vary greatly, depending on the location they are at, when it happened. <br><br>For instance, there have been cases where people in third world countries have flown on commercial flights to western countries, hoping to live on social welfare. However, they do not have status as any sort of refugees, so they would be rejected, but they destroy their passports en route. When they land, they are in a limbo -- they will not be allowed to enter the country, but cannot be sent back. <br><br>In fact, there is a fairly famous case of an asian traveller who has been stuck in an airport in France for several years. I dont' remember what the details were, but something went wrong -- he never intentionally destroyed his papers, but he might have been allowed to board a flight by mistake, without having the correct immigration papers. He's been given the opportunity to enter a couple of different countries, but he wants to go to England -- but they will not allow him there. So he's stuck. The guy is some kinda celebrity, goes to the bathrooms in the morning, washes up, then sits around in the no-man's land of the airport all day, receiving money or food from travellers who know him.

In early July, the Iranian Kareem Nasser Miran finally received permission to seek asylum in Belgium.   Travel documents issued by the Belgian Refugee Commission allow Miran to leave the French Charles de Gaulle Airport where he has been living for over a decade.  Although it is not unusual for asylum-seekers to wait that long for travel documents, Miran is the only asylum-seeker known to have spent the waiting period living on an airport bench.  He was originally stranded in the Paris airport during a transit between England and Belgium when he lost his Belgian travel documents and both countries refused him entry without papers. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ugrozzer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grozzer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/12/02 9:08:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=97.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Strange rules</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> so we should just return all the detainees who are citizens of other states?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Duh.

Lindh is getting this treatnment DESPITE what most Americans including our law makers would like to see.  Most of us would be happy to have his ass rotting in Cuba with the rest.  However as a US citizen (and it is very hard to forcibly strip a native born citizen of his citizenship)he has certain rights that alien nationals in our control do not have. <br><br>And yes Austrailia did commit forces to this effort, but it WAS US soil that was attacked.   Think about this for a second.  Of all the Taliban/Al Queda forces that were involved, we only detained a couple hundred.  There is a reason for that.  We only detained those that are thought to A. have intelligence we can use, or B. were to dangerous to allow to go free.<br><br>Austrailia has a right to voice an opinion about how its citizens are treated (as does any other country) however once outside your borders (and this goes for the US as well) there is a limit to what a country can demeand of another country in relation to its citizens.<br><br>The US was the one attacked, we now have in detention persons who were associated with the organization that commited that attack.  No matter thier country of origin we have every right to treat those individuals as such with in the bounds of international law.  <br><br>Lindh is an exception because of our laws and constitution.  There is little we can do about that as much as we would like too.     <br><br>And I never really herad that the demand was for these people to recieve the maximum sentance.  The demand I heard was an assurance that they would be dealt with appropriately by thier countires of origin if repatriated.  Considering some of them come from Chenya and Yemen, pretty chaotic places at best, this is not an unreasonable demand. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800"
