I'm not left wing.  I look at both sides, and decide where I stand, not based on my other decisions, but on my own personal beliefs and opinions.  For example.. in fact, a few examples way off topic.  (By the way, I will not allow this thread to become misdirected by this, so this will be my only response off topic for this misdirection)  Gun control.  Right wing is all for right to carry firearms to protect yourself.  I feel that it is necessary to have much more strict gun control policies, and much harsher crimes for offenders.  A longer waiting period and more extensive background check is necessary, as well as a very specific tracing identification for the weapon to monitor more closely to help stop the almost out of control reselling of &quot;legal&quot; guns to those who should not be able to attain them.  Right wingers would yell at me about how that would infringe on their god given right to protect themselves, and I disagree.<br>
<br>
Abortion.  I grew up in an area that has free clinics and the girls around my way have abortions to replace birth control.  That is just plain wrong.  Sure that's a right wing view, but let me go a little further.  Everyone makes mistakes.  That said, the clinics need to stop offering unlimited free abortions, and say &quot;Okay you made a mistake.  If you want a free abortion, you must take this literature, and if you ever make another mistake, you'll be responsible for either paying the fee, (which it should be expensive enough to deter this activity) or you'll have to be responsible for caring for the baby.  In the event you opt to pay, you MUST have your parents present with identification.  Find me a right or left winger that would love me after that one.<br>
<br>
That's enough off topic.  Bottom line is, I look at things from my own perspective, and I'm not influenced by a &quot;line&quot; of thinking.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I'm not suspect here.  I don't need to answer those questions at all, but I WILL tell you this.. we're like a family here, and we all get involved in some way or another.  So even those that &quot;just&quot; work with computers as you assume I do are involved in all of the activities, and involve themselves in the programs wherever possible.  I doubt it's anything like your little newspaper where you have to hide your stories from your co-workers or risk having them steal it and take your job.  No one here is like that.<br>
<br>
Oh and one last thing.  Keep the flames to the flameboard.  I don't and won't respond to flames, and there's a reason I don't post on the flameboard. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

Shit, just when I was starting to like you Jaeron. I will never understand gun control supporters. Makes about as much sense as banning cars due to drunk drivers or forbidding swimming due to drowning accidents.<br>
<br>
Well, I should qualify that. I do understand those who want to control automatic weapons sales... that much at least makes sense. But to take away a persons ability to defend themselves because some people abuse weapons is akin to communism in my mind. <p><br>

I didn't say I wanted to ban guns at all.  In fact, I said you SHOULD be allowed to carry a gun, it just shouldn't be so freaking easy to get one.  I grew up in a neighborhood that it was so easy to get a gun, I could get one faster then a 14 year old could get a case of beer for a party.  I've had one put to my temple by some psycho because of Mortal Kombat 2, (Fatality three times in a row really pissed him off, he said he'd give me a beat down if I did it again, and since I was a smart alec my entire life, I did a Friendship) and I'm just saying that it shouldn't be so easy to get them.  If you track the guns more, and if you make sure the people getting them aren't gonna either use them for the wrong reasons, or just sell them to some idiot who will sell them to kids, there's no problem.  So again.. re-read what I said.  I'm all for people having guns.  Just think we don't do enough to stop the wrong people from getting them. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

These methods only punish those who get guns through legal means. A waiting period is said to stop the guy who suddenly decides in a fit of rage to kill his wife who is cheating on him. I contend that if he is in a fit of rage he will use the first thing that ctaches his eye. By the time he gets to the local gun shop he has already had time to come to his senses and it is no longer an instinctive reaction, but is premeditated.<br>
<br>
As far as tracking weapon IDs, that is already done and as history tells us, there are many ways to sidestep this. I have no problems with keeping records mind you, I just don't think it is very effective as long as there are private sales, which you can't stop.<br>
<br>
EDIT**<br>
<br>
BTW - I think the problem is not the current laws, but the fact they are not enforced. If a person murders another person and there is no question that it was not in self defense or accidental, then they should get the death penalty imo. You can not repay a life, so your life is forfeit. At the very least they should get an automatic life sentence.<br>
<br>
If a person robs another person, give them 10 years. Burgalry 5 years. Rape 7 years, etc. Make the sentence, enforce it every time and I am willing to bet the crime rates will drop significantly. <p><br>

As far as mandatory minimum sentences go, I don't have too much of a problem with it, but there never is a crime without a question.  Simple fact is, people are put in prison that aren't supposed to be there constantly.  My own father was convicted of a crime he didn't commit.  I have no problem with the justice system mind you, I have plenty of faith in it.  I'm just saying nothing is perfect.

If you have it illegally, there's a good chance you're not gonna use it to combat crime.

Well, if they only forbid you to own guns after commiting a gun related crime, I would agree. However any felony (including felony OUI) makes you illegal to own a gun (at least in my state). I think this ridiculous. Just because a person commits a felony in their younger days (as long as it's not gun related) should not keep them from owning a gun their whole life.<br>

he lied under oath. nuff said.<br>

<br>
the oath that we take is the foundation of our legal system. It is not something to be taken lightly. and yet here is the commander in chief, the ultimate executor of the nations laws, completly disregarding the most fundamental element of our judicial system. <br>
<br>
doesn't matter if it was our business or not, he lied under oath. Its black and white, it was dead straight wrong. <br>
<br>
<br>
knowing that he lied under oath and told bald faced lies to the american public, it does not make it hard for me to swallow the other charges of corruption such as his relations with the chinese, and his selling of pardons. <br>
<br>
f* clinton.<br>
<br>
<br>
if politics is a dirty game. so be it. but two wrongs don't make a right. telling bald faced lies to the american public and purguring yourself is NEVER RIGHT or EXCUSABLE. <br>

<br>
Want to go through all the contested divorce cases in this country and charge everyone who's version of the facts did not meet reality with purgury?  (Besides his own extra-marital affair, THAT is probably one of the main reasons that Newt Gringrich kept his mouth shut more or less over the whole mess)  There is not a whole lot of room to be pointing fingers in Washington about lying.<br>
<br>
There is a damn good reason why there is almost NO precedent for a purgury charge based off a CIVIL case.  Technically it is illegal, but it is also the nature of the things.  If he had lied during a criminal investigation.  That is a different kettle of fish.<br>
<br>
Since the other charges (and they were MUCH weaker than the purgury charge) stemmed from that one answer, it was still the biggest mountain out of a mole hill mess in US history.<br>
<br>
Impeachment was a process put into place for a good reason, but the two times it has been used against the presidency were open, naked politics. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Uh... it's the opposite way round! Journalists on the same newspaper share information and work together on stories. We have meetings all the time where we let each other know what's going on, and help each other out. Today I have four stories to write and I will be working with four other journalists.<br>
<br>
We only have to be careful to hide stuff from other publications.<br>

<br>
Ragden, the man lied under oath... IN the supreme court. He was the leader of a nation that stands on truth and justice and he went against it. He has ZERO morals. If he couldn't follow the guidlines he swore to when he became president, then he shouldn't have accepted office. Like Elche said, the issue of lying under oath is black and white. There's NO grey what so ever. I just can not stand to see people try to justify the mans actions. <br>
<br>
And for the whole &quot;what he did was his personal business&quot; crap. The same thing applies to that. When you are a leader of the most powerful and respected nation in the world you have a HUGE responsibilty to uphold strict morals. Yes, I am a republican and I know other republicans have lied and had affairs while holding a public office. But I look at them the same way...They were wrong and have no business being a role model for our nation. These are the people that represent our country and when they don't abide by the laws and moral codes of our country then DON'T get into office.<br>
<br>
That's all there is that needs be said about. It just peeves me to no end when people try to beat around the topic and lessen the extent of what these politicians, or anyone in a high standing posistion, have done. It's the same thing that happened with OJ Simpson. The guy MURDERED two innocent people and got nothing but fined cash that means nothing to him. Our judicial system is extremely weak when it comes to putting famous or high standing people rightfully into place after commiting wrong acts. <p><hr>

He lied under oath in a deposition for the Paula Jones harrasment case.  That was a civil case.  It had nothing to do with the Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
And I am not justifying his actions.  What I am saying is that an impeachment was way out of line for the offense.  And it is the height of hypocricy to throw stones at Clinton, while ignoreing the sins of everyone else.  If your going to hold Clinton to that standard then you hold EVERYONE to that standard.  You don't single out one person because you don't like his politics.  <br>
<br>
You want a saint as persident?  Good fucking luck.  The closest we ever had to that was President Carter.  And the only reason HE did get elected was the Watergate mess.  No one has ever cast doubt on his integrity or honesty, but damn he was a walking clusterfuck as a President.  <br>
<br>
The people of this country elected Clinton TWICE despite knowing full well what kind of sexual morals he held.  Like it or not, his POLICIES were at least acceptable to the majority of the American voter.  And he was very effective in getting those policies enacted, with some notable exceptions (health care)<br>
<br>
What he was, was a very <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> effective</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> politician and leader who had a horrendous personal control problem.  And don't miscontrue what I am saying when I say &quot;effective&quot;  If you don't think that he was not VERY good at getting his policies enacted, you had you head in the sand for 8 years.  I didn't agree with a lot of what he did, but I cannot deny his abilities in pushing for them, unlike a lot of his peers.  His faults on the otherhand were no worse than most others in his profession.  You can't vilify one and ignore the others.<br>

An intentional lie given while under oath or in a sworn affidavit.<br>

No, I'm not quoting out of a dictionary, but that's the exact definition.  If you commit perjury, I don't think the judge will say &quot;Well it wasn't a very important trial.  Just a civil case.&quot; when he's deciding rather or not he committed this crime.  That would be like saying &quot;Well yeah.. stealing from a mail room is a federal offense, but he didn't get anything of value.&quot; <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

A leader can only lead those who are weaker then (s)he.  A weak leader has even weaker followers.  That can be said for all attributes.  I'm sorry, but there is a large difference between everyone out there, and The President of the United States.  To say there isn't is pure ignorance.  Think of it this way.  I'm sure alot of people jerk-off in a peep-show theatre.  But if you're the host of a childrens television show, you better expect to take more heat if you get caught. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127902">Jaeron -Shadowstalker</a>, Merc for Hire, at your service.

The office of President has only 3 hard requirements.  You have to be a native born citizen, you have to be 35 years old and you have to win the election.  My god have you even dug a little into the history of the Presidency?  The few Presidents that met YOUR standartds have been some of our worse.   Who decided those standards were the right ones?  Because the American people have shown time and time again that they don't give a crap about the President as a role-model, as much as they care about a President who gets the job done. <br>
<br>
You remember the check bouncing scandle in congress?  Technically that was a whole BUNCH of felonies, but you didn't see any one sicing the lawyers on them.   More than a few in congress went through nasty divorces.  You don't think that there was some twisting of the truth under oath in those cases?<br>
<br>
It is one thing to call Clinton on the lie, bring it out to the public etc.  That is what happened time and time again with his many affairs.  It just drove his detractors nuts that the public didn't seem to care.    It is another thing to bring legal proceedures against him for something that, while technically illegal,  is almost NEVER procecuted anywhere else.  THAT was going to far.   In fact in the end about the ONLY people who wanted to take it that far was the republican members of the House.  The public didn't want that.  The Senate didn't even want to go that far.  He deserved a censure, for sure.  In fact it would have been more effective and politically smarter, than actually going for an impeachment that made Clinton seem a victim of a partisan attack.<br>
