Teir'Dal/Dark Elf<br>
12 Necromancer<br>
<br>
I know what you're thinking. &quot;Just who is this irresistible creature who has an insatiable love for the dead?&quot; Well, let's begin by throwing out the notion that I'm just another living dead girl.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong. I'm just as mercurial as the next Teir’Dal, given to moments of mirth and brooding. However, I do not define myself by the stereotype of one who practices my Art. I'm not some angst-riddled loner living under some curse. I certainly don't consider myself Damned. Death isn't my burden, it's my passion. It is a blessing from Innoruuk that I have been chosen to be its harbinger.<br>
<br>
I felt the call to the crypts at a very young age. When other children were playing their games of make-believe, I was already living with the reality of death. My mother's life was taken by the wife of the man who is my father. Oh, please, don't act so surprised. Sex and death aren't novel concepts; and violent acts of passion are age old traditions. Ah, but I digress. Please forgive my lapse.<br>
<br>
My father's wife stole me from my mother's dying arms and introduced me to her own family and house as her daughter. It was no act of mercy, but one of revenge and ambition in equal parts. <br>
<br>
For the most part I was accepted into the family as one of their own. My new siblings greeted with the same treachery they did each other. &quot;Mother&quot; instructed us all, early on, that if we desired the luxuries of her wealthy household then we would have to earn those privileges. No, she didn't mean through &quot;hard work&quot;; we weren't set to sweeping floors and carrying out the garbage like slaves. Our only task was to win her favor.<br>
<br>
Oh, how she toyed with us. Looking back I can see the benefits from her ways. After all, I could never trust anyone more than my brothers and sisters, and I didn't trust them at all. They were the competition. To see them coddled by mother would push me to such lengths. Obviously those vulgar displays of emotion were meant to bring out my hate and they were always successful. Deceit, treachery, and violence became my toys of choice. The plan was always simple: Do whatever it takes.<br>
<br>
Surviving my childhood was no small feat and living beyond my adolescence was just short of a miracle. I had the fortune of being my father’s favorite. His discreet guidance insured my success. It was his desire to see me well that landed me into the care of the dreadful gnome, Nyntiki. <br>
<br>
A powerful necromancer in her own right, Nyntiki sensed in me what I had already known for myself. I was destined to walk hand in hand with Lady Death. Nyntiki gave me a glimpse at my potential and set me on the path of Bones. Under her harsh tutelage I honed that raw potential into a crude Art and entered the profession of Necromancer. There was never any doubt about my path. The dead have been whispering into my ears since before I could speak. Now fully grown, they walk with me as company and servants to my cause.<br>
<br>
It was Nyntiki who first pointed out the mark of the Tears upon my back. I remember the moment clearly as nothing had ever stopped the gome mid-lashing before. She seemed amazed by it and came at me again. This time sans whip. There was question after question though. When finally realzing I had no answers she began to speak of Veeshan and her brood of dragons. I didn't understand her point at the time, but she insisted that one day I would.<br>
<br>
Getting back to family matters, it was a miracle my siblings also survived our childhoods. A pity that father did not. He was cut down by my sister, making my eldest brother, Tsadrin head of our household. Mother fled before the knife was put into her back. She lives on and remains a powerful force in our lives who manipulates from the very shadows. We may never be free of her influence and that is something of a boon and still a curse.<br>
<br>
Having fulfilled the tradition of patricide and our youths behind us, my brood split apart. We each went our separate ways to pursue our separate goals.<br>
<br>
I had the recent luck to run across a warrior named Illistyl Silverleaf in Oasis. She had only just managed to survive a battle with one of the Sand Giants who bully about the desert. I helped her as I could, forging a pact between us that traded out my health for her hurts and then bandaging her with my meager skills. As I assisted I couldn't help but spy the mark wrought on the back of her hand. I asked her about it and showed her the one I bear on my back and we found them identical. She seemed enthused to find this out and directed me to the Tears with haste.<br>
<br>
So, here I am in the present moment, touring your hall with wide open eyes and certain understanding about my future and destiny alongside you. <br>
<br>
Have I come unknowingly into my new home?<br>
<br>
Will you have me? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ueilunedakallabeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eiluned Akallabeth</A> at: 10/21/02 3:08:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=375D88><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usteoff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>steoff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/21/02 3:30:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Greetings, Tears..</span><hr size=1> *grin*<br>

Her pale eyes drift over the decor and then to the various faces gathered around, scrutinizing everything and everyone. She efforts a warm display, but nerves and nature only allow the elf a rather weak smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks for your hospitality, Moline. I think I shall have a glass of Neriak Nectar as I am rather parched after the long journey to your hall.&quot; She gathers the thick shadows that dress her and slips quietly over the stone floor, carefully navigating the furnishings appointed 'round the room.<br>
<br>
While many of her kind would move into a nice shadowed corner, Eiluned takes a spot near the blazing hearth. She basks in its glow, drinking in its warmth through her skin. Its for such comforts that her smile is fully realized. She shares it with the strange couple that greeted her arrival, Steoff and Eglath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I was sure I would meet you both!&quot; she says, her voice low and manner cool. The young necromancer gestures elegantly as she addresses the duo. &quot;You are both individuals of fame. Or, to be more accurate - notoriety. That you found each other is...interesting to say the least. I would think that your company keeps the guild quite lively. I can't wait to catch the gossip that's surely flying about.&quot;<br>
<br>
A servants approach steals Eiluned's attention for a moment; just long enough for her to take up a glass and thank the wench with a dismissive wave of her hand. She sips from her glass before speaking again. &quot;Ohh I think I'll be just fine here.

She raises a brow at the barbarian and casts a chilly look over her him. The smile at her lips seems oddly out of place.<br>
<br>
        &quot;My, aren't you boorish? I suppose it's just an aspect of your charm.&quot; humor lends a bit of warmth to her deep, indigo complexion. Her slender hand slips smoothly out of Ralstaan's grasp as she turns to eye the serving whench's load landing to the table top.<br>
<br>
        The young necromancer tries to obfuscate her disgust with a weak smile. &quot;You're so...thoughtful, Ralstaan. I'll have to come up with ways to 'thank' you for such a treat.&quot; Eiluned's voice carries lightly over nearby ears, that may or may not find its laced with just a hint of malice.<br>
<br>
        With a sigh, Eiluned takes up the heavy glass with both hands and lifts the drink to her lips. She winces, obviously not find the taste to her liking. The glass drops absently to the table, its contents spilling over the wood. She raises the shadowy sleeve of her robe to her lips to wipe the foul taste away. &quot;I'm not impressed by your tastes, Ralstaan..&quot;<br>
<br>
        That said the Teir'Dal gathers the skirt of her robe with one hand and makes her way over to a more tidy table. The sound of rustling silk moving over the stone floor scores her action. She pauses before taking her seat and darts a look back over her shoulder at Ralstaan. An easy grin targets the warrior. &quot;I fully expect you to make the matter good with an offering of the tavern's finest champagne.&quot;<br>
<br>
        With flourish she spins about, her skirts flying about her, and drops into the seat in a boneless motion. She settles in, legs elegantly crossed and elbow perched at the table's edge. She rests her head against her hand and grins. &quot;You're welcome to join me for a drink as I wait for the guild's officers to arrive.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ueilunedakallabeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eiluned Akallabeth</A> at: 10/22/02 5:35:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=375D88><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/btearsofveeshan25764.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eilunedakallabeth>Eiluned Akallabeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/22/02 5:54:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Greetings, Tears..</span><hr size=1> Eiluned's pale gaze pans over the room to spy the white wolf addressing her. She raises a brow at this, seeming very curious. &quot;There are none like you among my people, Salvia. None that change shape to such effect.<br>
<br>
&quot;My own limited experience has not delivered me into the company of one of Tunare's soldiers until now and I must say, I'm in awe.&quot; She stands from her seat and stalks over towards the druid. The necromancer takes her in with wide eyes and reaches out to pet Salvia's fur.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's so soft,&quot; she practically purrs. &quot;It reminds me of cloak I keep at the very back of my closet. Though that fur fails to compare to the coat that dresses you. I'm sure you'd fetch a lovely plat if...&quot; She stops herself, removes the hand and takes a step away from the wolf.<br>
<br>
Eiluned turns 'round to return to her seat. &quot;Well met, Salvia. It's good to know you, mistress. Your warm greeting is certainly appreciated. As for the barbarians..&quot; she turns to spy Ralstaan, her head cocked slightly to the side.<br>
<br>
&quot;My only interest in such creatures is in their prowess on the fields of battle. Their meaty skins make great shields and that is something to be appreciated&quot;<br>

&lt;Salvia trots out the back door, where Ssolaria had beckoned her to og earlier.  A yelp echoes down the hallway and Salvia can be seen darting passed the messhall into the mainhall, water and soap flying from her fur.  Ssolaria is in hot pursuit, washbrush and bucket in hand&gt;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=375D88><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/btearsofveeshan25764.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ralstaan>Ralstaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/23/02 3:37:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Greetings, Tears..</span><hr size=1> Ralstaan looks down at the tankard of ale and shakes his head before lifting it to his lips.  He drains what little was not spilled over the table and sets it down before making his way to the Necromancer.  As he pulls a stool out to have a seat next to her he motions for the serving girl to approach, and upon her arriving, he whispers something into her ear.  Though a slap across the rump would assure speedy service he remembers he is in the company of a woman of class and thinks better of it, though his eyes continue to follow his intended target as the serving girl saunters away.  After a fashion he turns to speak to Eilund.<br>
<br>
&quot;The finest champagne this tavern has to offer eh??  Well girl you have robbed me of my last bit of plat.....but there is no doubt in me that you are worth it and I should enjoy learning more of a fellow sister-in-arms....though from what I have already learned methinks you are more rogue than necromancer...&quot;<br>
<br>
He studies the look she offers him and attempts to identify it as either one of insult or flattery.  He remains studying her, chin resting on fist, when out of the corner of his eye he notices that two sparking glasses of champagne have been set out before them.  He watches her lift her glass to her lips and drink, and so as not to fall behind he lifts his as well, though with a hand much less practiced at it.  He gulps it without a taste.  As she sips the crystal clear champagne he smiles.  The look on her face this time is much easier to identify.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well girl I am happy that you accept my peace offering, and the next time I will save the ale for a stout barbarian lass.&quot;  He surpresses a chuckle as he notices her soft face twist at the memory of the aftertaste.  &quot;Now I hope you do not think a man boorish, but the hour grows late and I do not wish to keep you...there are elders for you to speak to.&quot;<br>

Ralstaan stands and slings his axe over his shoulder before turning to her again.  He looks at the bottle of champagne and wonders how many men will attempt to help her finish it after he leaves.  He laughs inwardly and offers her a smile before turning to the door.  He thinks to himself, at least he was there to share the first glass. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/btearsofveeshan25764.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ralstaan>Ralstaan</A> at: 10/23/02 3:43:53 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=375D88><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/btearsofveeshan25764.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mirahze521>Mirahze521</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ToV Elder</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/24/02 11:11:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ftearsofveeshan25764frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Greetings, Tears..</span><hr size=1> Eiluned, I am looking forward to speaking with ouy in Norrath.
