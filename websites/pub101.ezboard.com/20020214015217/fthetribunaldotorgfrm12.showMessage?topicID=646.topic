If I were to be sarcastic it would fall far short of any target that I aimed it at.  How could I possibly use sarcasm or wit when I am not worthy.  My opinions are of no worth.  You are such a better person than I am.  You must be quite the better EQ player than I am also.  I could not possibly have as much to offer in an end-game scenario than you would.  I would surely make every attempt fail due to my extreme ignorance and stupidity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukrickettbuffslinger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krickett Buffslinger</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www228.pair.com/judygale/Gsmile.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 595<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/02 6:16:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SydesJokes/files/Pictures/h/homer_simpson.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shut the Fuck up Birch !!!!!</span><hr size=1> Never mind. <p>Krickett Buffslinger<BR> Shamaness of the Tribunal<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usarta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>l33t board camper</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/02 9:32:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=646.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tribanal Flameboard?
