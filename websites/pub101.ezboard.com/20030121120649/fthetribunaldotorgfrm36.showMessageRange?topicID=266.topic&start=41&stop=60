OK Radgen, pull out the paperwork then. If you're positive then it's obviously written somewhere, countries don't operate by unwritten rules. Show me something, anything. You cannot because there isn't anything. There's nothing in whatever &quot;international relations&quot; you work with and I can tell you that there's nothing about it at the US War College curriculum or any US military leadership courses, and that's because it's not true. What you're saying is conjecture, plain and simple. Until you put down a document saying it's true, then you're doing nothing but pushing air. If there were one it sure wouldnt be classified, so no reason you couldn't post it.<br>
<br>
-Wenin, I do not HAVE to provide any proof of it because I ALREADY HAVE. Its written in to the general articles of the convention which I have ALREADY POSTED. There's the proof. Now you'd very much love to disprove it, I believe it's incumbent on you to come up, for once, with *one factual statement supporting your claim*. So to do that why don't you come up with ONE historic example of what you believe to be true. Anything, for once. Anything but baseless conjecture. We follow the geneva convention at all times because we want to. The proof is right in the general articles that we don't have to.<br>
<br>
Obviously you're incapable of comprehending a legal document, and luckily they don't write them by your examples. The paragraph you quoted doesn't even have anything to do with nonsignatory countries. The only one that deals with the question at hand is the last paragraph of article 2, read it over and over and it'll sink in eventually, its not hard. <br>

Aritcle one clearly says &quot;all circumstances&quot;  There are no exceptions to &quot;all&quot; and that is the position the US has always held.   Article 2 is not quite the clear cut loophole you seem to think it is.<br>
<br>
You seemed confused by the status and treatment of the prisoners in Gitmo but if you would bother to read the entire Convention (or at least the part about POW treatment and &quot;unlawful&quot; combatants) you would see that we are in fact abiding by the GC, if not actually being more lenient than required.<br>
<br>
Well since this quote of yours helped start this argument lets go back to the beginning and pick it apart.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The geneva convention as we know it now didn't exist in WWII. At that time it was even less defined and harder to enforce, much less follow, than it is today which in most aspects is pretty damn hard. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The Geneva Convention of '49 is a revision of an older document.  The first version came into being in 1864 (though the US was not a party to the treaty at that time.)  There have been 3 revisions since, the last of which was 1949.   There were very few changes made between the 1929 version and the 1949 version.  The Nuremburg trial  and the Japaneses war crime trials were based largely on the 1929 treaty, so they WERE enforced prior to current one (as a side note, we applied the treaty standards to Japan even though they never signed on to the treaty)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It only applies to undersigned countries, so by not being representatives of any country al qaeda is not protected by it, and since the taliban government never undersigned it neither are they.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
AQ is not considered a party as far as the convention is concearned they could not &quot;sign&quot; it or even acceded to it if they wanted to.  AQ falls under Article 3 more than anything(though such non-state international entities were not really considered by the convention) and as long as the country they are operating in is a signatory or has acceded to the convention, they have all the protections aforded in Article 3.  But they are also almost to a man, unlawful combatants, which means they forfiet any protection the GC would otherwise offer.  Unless there is a uniformed unit of AQ out there somewhere, very few if any AQ members would be eligible for POW status.<br>
<br>
The Taliban is more clearly covered by Article 3.  Afganistan was a signatory of the Convention.  Does not matter who is actually in charge.  A change in government does not change treaty obligations.   We did not invade, we backed one side of a civil war.  Taliban soldiers, if they could be clearly identified as such, ARE eligible for the more limited protections offered under Article 3.<br>
<br>
And lastly, just what part of the GC don't you think we should abide by?  Seriously, the only thing the GC requires is that non-combatants, (wounded, prisoners, medical personal etc.)  Be treated humanely and with due process.   Just what is your problem with that? <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
No where in there, does it say that a signatory of the GC can ignore the GC in the event that a non-signatory or even another signatory ignores the GC.<br>
<br>
There is absolutely no statement within the GC where it states that a country can ignore the GC.  Even dealing with Terrorists, and the fighting in Afghanistan, the GC can't be &quot;ignored&quot;.  Terrorists are covered by the GC, they just don't possess the &quot;rights&quot; of a lawful combatant.<br>
<br>
As far as historical examples, I gave them, while you have not.<br>
<br>
WWII - Japan had NOT signed the GC.  They also did not abide by the GC.  The US on the other hand was a signatory and HAD to abide by the GC, even when dealing with Japanesse prisoners.<br>
<br>
Radgen brought up Serbia vs Bosnia.  Again, another conflict where one side had signed the GC, while they other hadn't.  During the conflict both sides ignored the GC.  Now, after the conflict, Serbia is on the chopping block.<br>
<br>
But you on the other hand, can't present ONE instance where a signatory has been in a conflict with a non-signatory that did not abide by the GC, where the signatory then also ignored the GC.  Not a single one.  I'm not even asking for a situation involving the US.<br>
<br>
Any signatory.  Just one Maxa.<br>
<br>
The GC isn't just a treaty between the signing countries.  It's an agreement on how each country will wage war, no matter who they are fighting.  There is never an instance where a signing country can ignore the GC, even when you talk of unlawful combatants.  Though they don't have the same rights as lawful combatants, they still have rights under the GC, which can't be ignored.  We could not use an AQ terrorist as a human land-mine detector, without violating the GC (and a host of other agreements).<br>
<br>

is so difficult for you to grasp and understand?  It's the FIRST article of the treaty.

I'll start with this since the general theme seems to be that you're having a hard time deciphering a legal document.<br>
<br>
-Maybe this will help clear it up. Straight and to the point, from General Article 4.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected by it. Nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are.&quot;<br>
<br>
Answering Radgen first, since you seem to be able to carry on a legitimate debate with some basis behind it.<br>
<br>
The US has *no* interpretation that we are bound by the GC when fighting entities not bound by the GC. The articles do not leave it open to interpretation. Like I said before, even if we for some reason did interpret it that way, it would be in the US regulations. If it's in the US regulations and that's what you're basing that statement from, then surely you can point to where it is. The answer is it doesn't exist, the US follows the GC by the letter when fighting signatory governments and only then, and it's not a true statement. If you can come up with that documentation, then I'll buy it hook line and sinker. Good first place to look would be FM 100.3 since it's our basic warfighting manual, but I can guarantee you it's not there. The GC is not in any way a &quot;guideline to fighting war&quot;, its a treaty just like any other, between governments. That's why governments that don't agree to it aren't protected under it, as it says in the general articles.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty familiar with whats going on in GTMO. I've been there 6 times since before they moved xray from behind Villamar housing to where it is now, and will be there again in December. If anyone else here has been there feel free to ask me a few questions about that base only someone who's been there a lot would know. We were not, in fact, abiding by the GC in two areas, the housing and the transportation. Open-air chain link cells do not abide by the letter of the GC, however for the area they're living in they're far better than anything we could construct for them other than air-conditioned cells, which isn't happening. When they were being transported, a lot of the prisoners fought, spit, pissed on, and threw shit at the guards, therefore by their own actions causing us to have to put them in the gloves, masks, and shackles. I have over time probably read most of the GC, not all of it for sure but most of the applicable parts. Maybe you have too, but the problem you're having isn't reading it's comprehension.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what it says in Art. 4, do you know why there's that paragraph at the end of Art. 2? If article one meant all circumstances regardless of hell or high water, and not all circumstances between the participant entities (which is what it does mean), then why would there be a reason to put that last statement in art. 2? The reason is that you are grossly misunderstanding article one the same way Wenin is, but what it refers to is fighting between participant nations. When theres a nonparticipant involved, we have article 2 and 4.<br>
<br>
Yes, 1949 was the last major revision to the GC, congrats. But to say there were very few changes between 1929 and 1949 is a gross misconception. I'm not sure what your point is in this paragraph really. Yes, just like I've been saying all along, we did abide by it with Japan for the most part in WWII. We did, but we didn't have to. You're intermixing &quot;enforced&quot; and &quot;abided by&quot; which are two wholly different things, and is what we are arguing about. You're saying we have to (i.e. enforced) and im saying we don't have to but do anyway (i.e. abided by, but not enforced) so your statement in that paragraph isn't clear at all.<br>
<br>
The first sentence regarding AQ is repeating exactly what I said in the quote above it, so no clue where you're coming from again. Another gross misconception you're having is the &quot;acceded to&quot; part. There is no differentiation between &quot;undersigned&quot; and &quot;acceded to&quot;. In order to &quot;accede to&quot; it, they have to provide a signed document acceding to it, which is the same method all signatories use unless they actually want to send their president to Switzerland. Again, government doesn't operate on word of mouth, it operates on having someones ass to hang if they don't do what they signed onto. Either they sign the GC and are protected by it, or the don't and aren't.<br>
<br>
Another misconception- &quot;Afghanistan signed onto it so they're protected, doesn't matter who's in charge&quot;. I have news for you, goverments are held responsible for their adherence to it, not tracts of land. When the taliban came into power in afghanistan they flatly declined being protected by the GC, and therefore the taliban troops are not protected by it. A change in government changes all treaty obligations because the new government is under no obligation to follow the policies of the one it replaced, and the taliban was the new effective government of afghanistan at the time. Changing the old governments policies is typically why new governments come into power. <br>
<br>
<br>
The last paragraph is from deep space. If you could point out anywhere I said that I don't believe we should follow the GC, then I'll gladly explain, but good luck. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wenin, play the victim if you'd like but insults go both ways. I give you a lot of shit because you absolutely refuse to provide any reasoning to anything you say yet sling insults worse than about anyone. <br>
<br>
Good lord man, are you reading these posts? I've posted TWO specific articles that delineate what is to happen with nonparticipating countries. Both say that nonparticipants are SOL unless they become participants. One you either can't understand or don't want to, and the other I hope you can.<br>
<br>
WWII. Ok, how is that applicable. We abided by it and they didn't, true true. In what way does that further your argument that we *had* to other than just once again you saying *because we had to* in the midst of it? We did because, and once again im repeating myself for the Nth time, it's our policy to. Not because we're bound by the GC to.<br>
<br>
Serbia. Applicable how? Serbia is *on the chopping block* for international war crimes. International war crimes can be commited by anyone of any nation completely regardless of participation in the GC or any other treaty.<br>
<br>
Even though it had nothing to do with the argument, I'll give you a damn good example of a signatory that didn't abide by the GC, which would be the US in Vietnam. Sure we did for the most part, but not by the letter even remotely and have been called out for it repeatedly, just like we're being called out for gtmo. I'll even give you a specific one. One of the articles concerning actual combatants concerns what weapons can be used and what can't. One instance, put in in 1949, dictates what caliber direct fire tube weapon can be used against personnel, if I remember right its .45 cal or it's mm equivalent. The .50 BMG falls outside that parameter because it blows people to chunks and is considered a cruel weapon. Our answer to that was the Quad 50, which is 4 .50 cal machine guns mounted coaxially on the back of a halftrack to get the rate of fire up enough to make it decent for anti-personnel use, which it's not even designed for. We used that for most of the latter half of the war and raised a middle finger at everyone who bitched about it.<br>
<br>
I gave you the proof that we don't have to, and just did again. It's right there in the General Articles that govern the use of the entire document. Now, if you would *kindly* provide some kind of proof that *has to do with the actual discussion we're having* that would rock! <br>

Regulations concearning the handeling of POW's are written to adhere to the GC.  Not the only consideration (security and intel being the other major considerations) but still a major part.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Custom<br>

<br>
We impose those restrictions on ourselves, in general, because we are nice people.<br>
<br>
There is no legal obligation to follow them, as clearly stated in the above paragraph.<br>
<br>
you said:<br>
&quot;Actually we are bound by the Geneva Conventions cause WE signed it, no nmatter WHO we are fighting.&quot;<br>
<br>
And you were flat out wrong.  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.<br>
<br>
wenin said:<br>
&quot;There is never a situation where the US can ignore the Geneva Convention&quot;<br>
<br>
Guess what?  He was wrong too.<br>
<br>
you said:<br>
&quot;Dumai, we are bound by the Convention, period.&quot;<br>
<br>
You may be noticing a trend here.  You were wrong, yet again.<br>
<br>
when Wenin said:<br>
&quot;The US must abide by the Geneva Convention whenever it is fighting a conscripted military force.<br>
<br>
Period.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was still wrong.<br>
<br>
Radgen, when you later said:<br>
&quot;Max YOU try knowing what you are talking about. Besides working end knowledge of the GC that I got while in the army(and we had to cover several practical aspects of it), I also spent (entirely too much) time studing International Law in collage.<br>
<br>
Signatories are bound by the Geneva Convention if they have signed, period. It does not matter WHO you are fighting. The only difference comes in the classification of your opponant. Serbian officers face charges based in part on the GC. (Yugoslavia was a signatory and Serbia still claims to be that country) This despite the fact that thier opponants, the Bosnian's and the Croation's hadn't signed off on the convention yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
You have now admitted that that whole bit of drivel as poppycock.(i'm running out of ways to say you were wrong)<br>
<br>
I hate to rub it in, but when you find evidence that supports the other side's position, and then claim both were right, it usually means you were wrong.<br>

<br>
This is clear and shows that we all were mistaken to one extent or another.  I was wrong about the US position on the latest version of the GC, true.  But my mistake was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>only</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in WHICH version of the GC was considered.  The US position is that the GC of '29 is now customary law and ALL parties, signees or not, are bound by the standards and provisions of THAT version of the convention unless the current GC is applicable.  Now tell me again we are not bound by the GC in all situations?    <br>

The US considers us(and every other party to a conflict) to be bound by SOME version of the GC in ALL situations.  We are only completely wrong and you two only completely right if you ONLY consdier the latest convention revision.  <br>
<br>
Even if the US is justified in saying that '49 in not appllicable.  (And there is a stonger case for that decision in relation to AQ, much weaker when in reference to the Taliban) We would still be bound by the provisions and standards of the '29(considered Customary Law).  So you cannot say we don't have to abide by the GC.  You can only say we don't have to abide by the '49 revision. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

Look into relations between the "Geneva Convention" and "Vietnam War" when talking about "Violations".  You'll find that there is plenty about how the US violated the Geneva Convention during the war.  How can this be, if according to you the US didn't have to abide by the convention?<br>
<br>
As for the Quad .50 Cal weapon system that was created, I wasn't aware of that, but I was aware of the Vulcan weapon system, both towed and mounted versions being used in Vietnam.  The weapon system was classified as an "Anti-Aircraft" weapon system, but were both used mainly on ground targets.  Firing into buildings, reinforced structures and at troops themselves.<br>
<br>
Showing where the US violated the Geneva Convention does not show that we didn't have to follow the treaty.  Interesting logic though.... I suppose. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I have yet to see anything in the GC that addresses specific weapon usage allowed against combat.  It does outlaw weapoms that cause undue suffering but does NOT specifiy anything specific. (this may seem like a silly comment when refering to warfare but it is more to cover actions like useing phosoporous coated bullets that have no real military advantage over regular bullets but simply cause more pain and suffering to those wounded.)<br>
<br>
At some point someone claimed useing larger than .50 caliber weapons against personel violated this standard.  It was quickly dismissed and had not been adopted as a standard by ANY of the Contracting Parties.<br>
<br>
A similar myth developed about Airborne trooops.  Some believe that the GC outlaws shooting Combat troops while they are decsending in parachutes.  This is noit true the prohipition against targeting parachutes was ONLY to apply to those escapeing damaged aircraft (qualifying as non-combatants.)  Airborne troops are combatants, mid-drop or not and so are legal targets, even in mid-air.<br>

LOL I was talking to Diamondeye about this last night.  He told me the same exact thing, that both of those (weapon caliber usage &amp; airborne troops) were myths.  Now I don't recall ever hearing about the airborne troop myth, but I did hear about the caliber limit one.  I mean it was always an on going joke about saying &quot;oh I was firing at his LBE when I shot him with the .50 Caliber, Sir.&quot;  Also when the Vulcan weapon system was discussed and joked about claims of &quot;Oh I was firing at the hardened structure, not the personel.&quot; were always brought up.<br>
<br>
I had always thought these weapons were against the GC.<br>

<br>
The sanctions over iraq need to end.  They aren't working, so the people of Iraq are suffering needlessly.  So we have to do something that will achieve the orginal goals of he sanctions (Iraq disarmament).  Weak kneed diplomacy has failed for the past 12 years.  It has been long over due, to employ strong armed diplomacy.  That is what we are doing today.<br>
<br>
Saddam has been left with a decision, either Iraq moves forward with him in command, or it moves forward without him.  Either way, it will move forward, and either way, it will be without weapons of mass destruction. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6094" target="top">Wenin Huirunda</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I read and understand that, but there is a disconnect going on between what is written above and how the GC is being implemented in world politics/law.  What that is telling me is that we are all missing something.<br>
<br>
Why is it refered to as the &quot;Geneva Convention&quot;, when there are really four Conventions, and two Protocols?  I've seen it refered to as both Geneva Convention and Conventions.  Is there a difference?<br>

The GC are 4 related treaties.  Basically 3 major revisions of the first document(and a whole host of annexes and modifiying treaties).  The US position seems to be that the latest revision from '49 is applicable as written.  SO it is not binding in all situations. (though the stated policy had been that we're  going to follow it anyway)  BUT the US considers the '29 version to be customary international law and therefore binding on all parties and states, whether they were parties to that version or not.   The current GC takes precedent, but in situations where it does not, the provisions of the '29 version is binding. <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Semi-retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>
