Obviously it is not legal, but aside from that.<br>
<br>
I've never done it myself.  I think it is crazy to pay real cash for something like items or characters, and I'm way too attatched to my character to ever consider selling him.  But I could certainly see why someone may do those things.  Especially those who sell their characters.  If it is wrong because of their gear...they obviously earned it right?<br>
<br>
The only time I could see really having a problem with this is if somebody was deliberatley using their guild to acquire items/cash/whatever with the intent to sell.  But what about the person who puts in their time, earns their gear, and then comes to a point where they've had enough of EverQuest?  Aside from being agaist the EULA, which I think is the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> last</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thing people get upset about when somebody sells, what is the problem with getting a little back out of your experience at the end?<br>

Selling items however, tied up camps and and kept legitimate players from getting those items while those who wanted to pay the cash could get decked out in a few days.<br>
<br>
Now EQ is flooded with most items and level one twinks are decked out regardless of Ebay. EQ has turned into an easy game where most items (and exp for the matter) have very little value. 90% of the items that have any real value attatched to them are no drop from high end zones. I don't see the other 10% as having a major impact either way.<br>
<br>
2000 was a very different situation imo, but now... I just don't say Ebay as an impact even if VI made it legit. <p><br>

<br>
Secondly, I think the biggest reason why people don't like it (and the main reason that I don't like it) is that it smacks of cheating. You are using an out-of-game method to achieve something you couldn't (or aren't willing to, at least) achieve via in-game methods. As an example - the only way to run as fast as a horse is by a) buying a horse b) getting the paladin/sk horse AA skill or c) playing a bard with the right equipment -  these are all &quot;in-game&quot; methods. However, you can also use a memory hack to run as fast as a horse - this is an &quot;out-of-game&quot; method, and one most people (other than those trying to do it =) would consider cheating. Now imagine you want a particular piece of equipment - you can a) kill the mob that drops it, or complete the quest that rewards it b) buy it with in game coin and/or items (assuming its droppable) or c) kill another player and loot it from them (on Rallos Zek, within certain limitations). An &quot;out-of-game&quot; method is to buy it on Ebay, Playerauctions, etc. The same goes for buying characters - by going the Ebay route, you are circumventing the game design that requires you to earn xp to level a character. It doesn't matter whether you think the game rules and design is wrong or stupid - if you want to play the game, you play it by the rules. If you don't like the rules, tough shit - go and play a game that has rules you do agree with.<br>
<br>
From an &quot;end-game&quot; perspective, I don't like the fact that someone can experience the content I do (ie. uber mobs, top level equipment, etc) without putting in the effort to get there personally. That probably sounds selfish, but I don't really care - its my opinion, not yours, so you don't have to like it or agree with it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Utility&quot; characters, like a druid or wizard to do porting, I don't have as much as a problem with (again, from a high level perspective - someone in the mid levels may feel very differently), but the selling and buying of raid level characters *really* pisses me off. Sure, you might consider it a waste of time that to spend x days getting to lvl 60+ and getting into a raiding guild, etc, etc but that's the rules of the game. If you don't like it, go and play another game.<br>
<br>
Finally, for people who talk about &quot;getting something back when you quit&quot; - in my opinion, you are &quot;getting&quot; entertainment month after month. If you feel you need to get something back when you quit, you probably should have quit a bloody long time ago.<br>

I think it has something to do with human nature by association. That once one feels they know someone by association that one has a social ownership over said person. Sorta reminds me of Loegan's comparison of dog and human mentality. Which in this case is very true. But the fact is that this is just a game and this is just a gaming community and no one has ownership over another person here. <br>
<br>
Yep, just a game! Ive heard it before and I'll say I again! Just a game! :) The only factors that play the role of falsely presenting itself as a game is human emotion (ie Hayzens attatchment to his dude) or RL association of other players (ie I casually know Hyper irl to rl marriages in guilds). But even then it's just a game :) So who cares? Funny thing is, from an American veiw point it would be completely acceptable to ebay because one would be capitalizing on themselves and their enviroment. But from a gaming stand point, it's against game ethics. So, which veiw point is correct? Who knows...who cares-- now stfu and have fun :P<br>

<br>
1) Some people buy other accounts because they are so hated that there mains have no friends and cant get groups..<br>
Imagine grouping with that Ninja looter and not even knowing it..<br>
<br>
2) Getting into a high level group and playing with a ebayed character that has absolutley NO clue how to play the character.. happens all too often with ebayd Chanters and clerics..  Soomeone might be able to play an ebayed warrior without anyone noticing... but casters its pretty noticeable..<br>
<br>
Its just bad gameplay to me.. Its not fair to the people who worked there asses off to get to a higher level to enjoy the nicer loot items that come with it.. have some rich punk ass snob 14 year old kid whos daddy bought them a 60 warrior on ebay.. get stuff youve been waiting to get forever..<br>
<br>
If you have to cheat why even play.. go play your playstation 2 and use your gameshark.. and have all your cheating.. <br>
<br>
If 1 thing EQ does do right its that there is little or no cheating allowed.. and that people are severly punished for doing so.<br>

Invested emotion into another. But that still does not mean that player is another person's property. Does anyone own you? I hope not :p Put it this way. If a friend sold their toon would you still be their friend or would you take the petty route and turn your nose? Please remember Im still excluding malice which is a whole different ball game. I wouldnt care if a true friend did that. Obviously the friend is far more important that a freakin toon from a game.<br>

But how is it any better if they quit and then the equipment is never used? I see what you mean if you are talking about someone selling the character and then starting over, but if they are quitting anyway, then I don't see your point. <p><br>
