<br>
Exactly.  Back to the point at hand.  Should any corporation (or government) be able to &quot;hack&quot; into your PC and delete files that they thing you shouldn't have? <br>
<br>
I'm not saying that piracy is ok, what I'm trying to say is the Recording, Movie, Computer Software, etc industries sat on their hands when they could of done something about piracy and now are trying to make their customers pay for the industries' lack of action.  <br>
<br>
Why would I pay $20 for a CD with only 1 song I like?  Why does the money from that CD mostly go to Recording Execs rather than the artist who actually wrote/sang the song?   I would gladly pay, say $0.25 per song that I want instead of buying a whole CD for just one song.  Will they do this?  No, because to them, the Internet is EVIL!  No one can stop piracy completely, so the RIAA and others should start finding ways to make a profit from the Internet instead of squeezing John Q. Public.<br>
<br>
I download songs that I hear from the radio or that friends recommend.  Then go to HMV.com to find the album then I download the whole thing off of KaZaa.  If I like it, I'll go buy it from the store.  If I don't, I just delete it from my PC.  End of story.<br>
<br>
Also, the US Government is thinking of putting hardware level software into hard drives, MP3 and CD players, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, PDAs, and other electronic devices that will prevent you from having copyrighted files on that device.  It's kind of stupid if you own the CD  (either you bought it or made your own music).  Don't believe me?  The latest CD from CÃ©line Dion will not play in a computer (and will actually destroy the CD-ROM in Mac machine in some cases).  Why did they do this?  To prevent someone from making copies and distributing it for free  (this method has been circumvented already), but I meant, who'd want to do that anyways? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I can just about guarantee you he did not receive campaign support from the recording industry- he is an Alaskan Republican that has served 6 terms in congress, SO, the ONLY interest he receives support from is (big) oil, and he really does noy NEED any support other than having his name on the ballot, because God himself could not defeat Stevens in an election in Alaska- he is bar none (even our founding politicians) the most influential, respected, well- known, powerful politician in the state today or at any point in its history. <br>
<br>
  I honestly do not know why he sponsored this bill.  He does have a relatively poor record when it comes to defending our constitutional rights (with, as with most republicans, the exception second ammendment rights), and though I would take offense if someone were to call him corrupt, he does tend to support big bussiniess.  MOST republicans do- as do a good number of deomocrats.  While you are more likely to find a democrat who has the backbone to stand up to big business, that is not to say that they are perfect, altruistic champions of the little guy.<br>
<br>
  Furthermore, this bill (the head topic) does tend to fit a conservative pattern.  It blatantly supports the interests of big business at the expense of the individual and consumer.  It removes constitutional checks upon the excercise of any form of authority.  It amounts to a consolidation of power (one of the key aspects of &quot;conservatism&quot;) through this removal of appropriate checks.  It tends to view the rights of the individual as malleable, and in a sense, more priveledge than right.  Generally, you will find &quot;conservative&quot; legislation to fit these patterns, which is not to say that no &quot;liberal&quot; legislation can.   And whoever said it is correct- more likely than not, there WILL be greater conservative support for this bill, and greater liberal opposition to it (with their respective associations of the Republican and Democratic parties.)<br>
<br>
  But all that is moot- whether you are a conservative, liberal, republican or democrat (or anyting in between or on the fringes) you should be able to recognize this is a &quot;bad&quot; bill.  Unchecked authority is a bad thing.  Authority over us in the hands of the private sector, which is not subject to the strict rules and standards of the government, is a bad thing.  I would imagine there is absolutely no provision for a remedy in the courts for this (ala asset forfeiture laws as the pertain to drug &quot;offense&quot;) meaning the corporations have nearly unlimited power, which if true, would be bad.<br>
<br>
  The things that have happened in this thread- i.e. people focussing more on partisan politics than the actual issue, are the same things that will happen on the floor in congress.  Please do write your senator about this, and other such issues.  I know I have already written the aforementioned Senator Stevens requesting he reconsider his sponsorship of the other bill. <p>  Lonagan Westrider

The entertainment industry (who is primarily behind these outrages) is hugely liberal.  The bills are sponsored by an overwhelming majority of democrats.

In fact except for first amendment issues they are as conservative as any group of buisnessmen.  Eben their liberal stand on the first admendment is more tied to there profit than it is to ant true belief.<br>
<br>
You seriously consider an effort to protect a big buisness' profit margin a left wing effort?  What the hell are you smoking.  <p><center><font face="lucida handwriting, arial" color="006800" size=+2><b>Radgen Waldjaeger</font></b><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="675f00" size=+1><b>Retired Pathfinder of Karana</font><br><font face="tempus sans ITC, arial" color="blue" size=+1>Shining Path</font></b><br><img src=http://radgen.homestead.com/files/tiger_run_md_clr.gif></center>

<br>
5 out of 6 democrats, and Fritz Hollings IS a liberal as well as Feinstein, the others I do not know, propose this legislation, yet all the blind liberals on this board, who cannot possibly defend said legislation, blame it on the conservatives. <br>
<br>
At least you people give me a good laugh. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148213">Kellianne</a>

<br>
Now look at the search and seizure rights of the Texas Rangers, Montana Brand inspectors and Montana fish and Game(just a few immediete examples) in matters relative to their agenda's and you see a scary pattern. A LARGE amount of freedom given to law enforcement agencies with the stipulation that it's all based off &quot;probable cause&quot;.<br>
<br>
I honestly hope this bill never see's the light of day. Just as they call marijuana a &quot;gate-way&quot; drug to harder stuff, this would be a &quot;gate-way&quot; bill to further supression of our rights.<br>

Yep. Duh :p<br>
<br>
<br>
Which brings to point. I dont think the recording industry is either. As a whole unit, it is competitive with different area's of itself. I really doubt they are, as whole, going for something. I would guess that it could be one of it's units, though, going after politcal aid. An example could be Sony funding certain congressfolk.<br>
<br>
That is opposed to blanket statements. It's not like any entity goes &quot;Well shit, this is the vogue thing now! Lets all work together on this&quot;.<br>

<br>
The hackers.  If it isn't challenging enough, then they won't do it.  But if this passes then it's like taunting the hackers.  This law will cause any hacker worth his/her salt to go after these people trying to monitor what is legal and what isn't.<br>
<br>
The internet and the U.S.  This law will only affect the land sites on U.S.  If these monitoring people cross a &quot;physical&quot; border ( such a going into a server in Canada )where a server may be storing illegal software then they have a) no duristiction and b) are trespassing illiegally and can prosicuted.  Not to mention that a U.S. company snooping illegally in their neighbours backyard will piss a lot of people off. So find a server out of the U.S. and store it there.<br>
<br>
Since I am Canadian and I like the U.S. a lot, my general opinion is that I don't like the thought of my hard drive being scanned.  So go fight it.  Find your local 15 year old hacker punk and let him know what the Big Guys are up to.  And then the let them loose to wreck havok.  <br>
<br>
But I don't think it will pass.  I have noticed that the you Americans take great pride in the ability to defend themselves when threatened ( &lt; - -that statement should alone stop the idea from passing ).  I wish I had that right.  ( In Canada, all you can do is flee legally, the bastards have more rights than you do defending yourself on your property )  It's my opinion I should have the right to shoot an intruder.  Not kill him, just a knee cap or two.  Make him cry real good.<br>

<br>
<br>
This law doesn't permit you and me to hack anyone, it will allow corporations like RIAA, Microsoft, etc, to hack you and me. So if the law was to pass, that DoS is still illegal, but it would be legal if RIAA did that to John Q Public.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The hackers. If it isn't challenging enough, then they won't do it. But if this passes then it's like taunting the hackers.

<br>
<br>
They do that anyways, so this law won't stop them from using DoS or other thing on RIAA.  But if a hacker is worth his/her salt, as you put it, they'll jump at the chance to do the RIAA's work.  Think about it.  These corporate pirates (or hackers) will be paid big money to snoop on people hard drives, searching for music files, pirated software, bootlegged movies, etc. After they are done deleting your collection of MP3s, which they copied to their own hard drives, your hacker friend will overlook his friends' hard drives.<br>
<br>
This law is just stupid.  While I don't think piracy is ok, I don't think that the Government should be helping Big Business when they f***ed themselves over years ago by ignoring the piracy problem and hoping it would go away. <p><center><img src="http://academic.algonquincollege.com/students/holm0056/vicsig2.jpg"><br>
