<br>
Its important to keep in mind here that once a person sins, they have earned their way into hell.  Thus, no one actually made it into heaven except through Jesus (Christian argumentation goes that since God is not bound by time, some Jewish people who show their faith before Christ was ever born are indeed saved by Christ anyways).  With such disaster (i.e. no one making it into heaven), God had to create a solution for mankind...Jesus Christ.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sure I can. All that must be done is attribute by definition at least one property to Aabc'dejkl that God does not posses. Such as infinite apathy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, you can't.  The attributes of the definition of God are unique and cannot be given to other things.  You are arguing along the same lines that I could say &quot;a triangle has 3 sides, but I'm gonna add another side, and therefore since it still has 3 sides its still a triangle&quot;.  Once you added that additional attribute, you ruined the definition.  The same concept applies with unique traits.  Remember, you can go ahead and believe ANYTHING you want, but your argumentation is done to convince others, and your ideals do not fit reasoning for others.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I already demonstrated why this is true.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No you have not.  You have given no philosophical nor physical PROOF that this is ALWAYS true.  All you did was give an example of where it *can* be true.  You must prove it to *always* be true, or at least true for this particular argument, if you want to claim it as &quot;truth&quot; to carry on your point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You're not trying to understand the argument, or you're being purposefully obtuse. Either way I'm not going to explain it again.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, I understand the argument perfectly well.  You are providing no proof for it, though.  All you do is find *something* that fits what you are saying, and then claiming it must be true for every case no matter what you throw into the equation.  You do know that 10 + 3 = 1, right???  You want the proof?  Look on a clock, it goes around to 12 o'clock and then starts over at one.  Start at 10 o'clock and go ahead 3 hours, what time is it? 1.  This obviously does not apply to every math equation we ever use.  The way you write your argument is the same as what I argue above, you don't place any bounds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>True and valid are not the same thing, and they do not have the same meaning. Valid simply means that if you accept the premises you have no choice but to accept the conclusion.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When it comes to the relevancy of me refuting what you are saying for this particular argument, the two words can be used interchangeably.  So far all you have done is set a bunch of premises and TOLD people they HAVE to accept them.  You give no proof for your premises!  Show proof for each one, THEN carry on.<br>

Yah, and you have to PROVE your statement that Socrates is a man.  You have to PROVE that all men are immortal.  THEN you can try and argue that thus Socrates is immortal, which EVEN THEN could still be untrue.  You haven't even gotten to the point of &quot;validating&quot; your premises, let alone arguing for your point.<br>

<br>
Love is physical eh?  I want you to mail me some love, i would love to see it.  While you are at it, I would also like you to mail me some time, because time is definitely real too! (note the sarcasim).  Time is conceptual, not real.  I could argue that time is better than spiders too.  You want evidence for why love is better than spiders (in at least *some* way), well here you are.  Love makes me feel good, spiders do not.  Therefore, in the fact that love pleases me, I find it better than spiders, at least in *that* way.<br>

<br>
Christian explanation for this is that the Old Testament is the Law of God upon mankind, upon which no man could 100% live under without breaking it at some point.  The point of the Law was to show mankind that he could not live/exist without God (which, if God is the creator of everything...would make that a true statement).  This would help man realize his need for God.  Then the New Testament is the actual realization of God saving mankind, through Jesus Christ.  The New Testament &quot;frees&quot; mankind from the Law so that he may live with God.  Not only will he be free from the Law, but will also want to do God's will and serve God, instead of serving himself.  This would be God's gift of the holy spirit to us upon asking him for his help.<br>

<br>
That is where you are misled.  Mankind is what ruins the world, just by existing and wanting to sin.  It is man that is greedy, desires, lusts, and commits horrible acts.  Religion (at least Christianity, can't speak for other religions since im not horribly familiar with all of em) has, and always will be sacred and righteous.  You have the blame backwards.  Open up the Bible, take a look at anything you want in there, read it all, learn what the messages of it are, and you will find that Christianity is about peace, love, humbleness, and God's glory.  Everything negative that has ever been said about Christianity has come from mankind, not from God.<br>

How absurd.  How about the Greek pantheon, the Hindu triumvirate, the Egyptian pantheon, etc?  All of these beings have some qualities God posses.  When you're studying ancient history do you constantly tell the teachers &quot;NUH UH, No fair!&quot; every time they mention one of these deities?<br>

This is a straw man argument and is rejected as such.

That's easy with a discontinuous topological mapping.<br>
<br>
Now... why all of a sudden, after a few tens of thousand years of homo-sapiens evolution and even some advanced (though pagan) civilisations, did the ominpotent entity decide that his faith franchise business model was a doomed enterprise ? How could he not have, in his infinite wisdom, conceived a perfect policy in the first place. That would most certainly have saved him from having to refund his customers at the price of his own son (though that whole trinity business most certainly looks like some dirty books cooking to me - could there be tax evasion in heaven ?)<br>

No, not absurd.  Once again you are trying to use one example to represent every possibility.  Its even in the Bible that mankind was created in God's image.  Its not impossible for some creations to take on similar attributes of the creator.  In this SPECIFIC case (in which I was referring to), when you give something &quot;ultimate and absolute power&quot; then that means it has a unique attribute because nothing else can have that same attribute BY DEFINITION of the attribute.  You therefore create a logical impossibility.  Thus such are the unique attributes of God BY DEFINITION before you even begin an argument (all powerful, etc), in which you cannot create an argument against these definitions, unless you are willing to accept that everyone calls you absurd and tell you that you talk non-sense.<br>

<br>
I have given refutations and examples already.  You have yet to even EXPLAIN why you think its true.  All you do is sit here and go &quot;its true because i said so&quot;.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>All premises arise from the first premise, which is true a priori for ONE MILLIONTH TIME.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
All premises arise from your own logical thought, upon which you have not proven ANY of them to be true, but instead just claim they are &quot;because you said so&quot;.  You have to go through EACH premise and PROVE it true.  Giving an example is NOT proving it true.  You are still running on a second-grade thought process here.  <br>

<br>
If it does not take on either a form of 1: energy, or 2: matter, it does not exist physically.  This would be a scientific definition, of course.  If it does not exist physically, then it does not exist except conceptually, which is what your second (and what you claim to be lesser) category is.  You gave no premise of a special &quot;third&quot; category in your argument.  If you want a third one, you better create it fast, and well.<br>

<br>
Everytime a question is answered, another question is asked and its always &quot;why?&quot;.  This is true for all fields, theological, philosophical, and scientific.  I can't answer every question.  I'm sorry but I just don't know God that well.  However, I can tell you why he created the world the way he did.  Everything he did and created was for his own glory.  The reason he created an imperfect world is because if he created a perfect world, the &quot;perfect&quot; mankind would never recognize his need for God, because he also would be perfect and happy.  Its also important to understand that God didn't have to (as a must) sacrifice his only son to save mankind.  He IS, afterall omnipotent.  Jesus's death is a representation of the pain and suffering that God was willing to go through to show his love for his own creation, and his desire to have that creation worship him.<br>

Satan.  Satan (or any devilish being) is definitely better off remaining a concept and not real for this world.

Waiting for CPU cycles... some more crap on the circle stuff : <br>
&quot;squaring the circe&quot; is a different problem (making a square of equal area to a given circle) and is demonstrably not achievable with a ruler &amp; compass (because PI is a demonstrated transcendental).<br>
<br>
Transforming a circle into a square on the other hand is fairly easy:<br>
<br>
Two spaces X and  Y are homeomorphic if there is a 1-1 function f <br>
from X onto Y such that f and f^{-1} are continuous. The function f <br>
is called a homeomorphism. The above problem can be reduced to <br>
showing that the unit circle is homemorphic to the circumscribed (or <br>
inscribed) n-gon. This can be done with a central projection, so that <br>
a point P on the circle corresponds to the point Q on the polygon <br>
which is the intersection of the line through P and the center of the <br>
circle.<br>

You have yet to further your &quot;proving&quot; of all of your premises.  Remember, examples not only don't count, but don't work.
