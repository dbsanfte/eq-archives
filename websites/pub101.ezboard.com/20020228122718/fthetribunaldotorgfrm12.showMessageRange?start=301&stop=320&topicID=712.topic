My answer to your question is; I dont.<br>
<br>
It's VI's fault and intention at the same time to make the AoW despawn after an hour. They expect any guild who is attempting the AoW to go through the the first two challenges before hand. Your *attempt* at the AoW is your reward for taking out Vindi and Statue. And his loot is your reward for *defeating him*. That would be my guess as to why he despawns so quickly. You're expected to combat all 3, sort of like an endurance test. I imagine defeating the Statue, and then only having an hour to prep and kill the Avatar was not a flaw in the mechanics of that challenge.<br>
<br>
Of course VI can only do that much on their part to enforce the logistics of that battle. If you (you in the general form) insisted on coming to Kael with the intent of only fighting the AoW, then you probably weren't serious about trying to kill him. That said if you were serious about killing him, you have two options:<br>
<br>
Camp kael Arena with a force capable of attempting the AoW and claim vindicator/statue before another guild can. Thus assuring your attempt at the Avatar<br>
<br>
Or, get in contact with guilds who attempt and kill the Statue but aren't capable of taking AoW yet, and work our an agreement with them to perhaps notify you when they are planning on killing the Statue.<br>
<br>
The other two options are get lucky, or complain until VI changes the spawn time; good luck. <br>
<br>
Basically, if you don't stick to those options, then the &quot;wasted&quot; AoW is entirely your fault. But I prefer to think of it as a lost spawn, not a wasted one. In my opinion there is a difference. You can't expect a less stronger guild to leave the Statue alone because in doing so, they will waste an AoW spawn. Just like you can't expect a shot at the AoW if you don't prepare to be there to take the Statue as well.<br>
<br>
Hope that answers your question.<br>

After all If you can drop the mob and you need his loot then you probably should. Would be nice if some of the guilds that drop him durring our peek hours would send us a tell letting us know they were killing the statue though so we could *maybe* run to kael with a raid force an try him.

If the Statue had zero loot for exemple, then it would be fine.  Or the best solution IMO is that killing the statue would make spawn a quest NPC, then you have to give an item to the NPC or say a key word, and that makes spawn the AoW, who has the normal despawn time.<br>
<br>
Your solutions about that are kinda silly, we cannot have a force able to give a real at AoW at any time.  It's a very hard fight where we need our raid crew there, which means ideally during weekend, or at least during weekdays it has to be during GMT evening.  If AN kills the statue during aussie evening, there's no way we can kill AoW after that, same if SI kill the statue during US evening. <p><center><b>Baron Karim Mishakal &lt;The Companions&gt;<BR>Oracle of the Tribunal<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2978 target=window>My profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/ukreese.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreese</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The OC<br>Original Cracka</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/12/02 1:14:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=308>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> He said all that?

<br>
&quot;..the problem isn't that you have to kill the Statue for fighting AoW, the problem is that the statue is killed by guilds that can't do AoW.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed. And I never said it wasn't a problem. The &quot;challenge&quot; (in part) is to kill the Statue to make the AoW spawn. The problem with guilds killing it who can't kill the AoW, can only be solved with the solutions I mentioned above. Those are the solutions for the problem in its current form. Changing the form of the challenge would be a good idea, and one that only VI could take care of. Of course if you only changed the Statue to having no loot, you'd only fix half the problem. So the guilds who want AoW will go uncontested, but the guilds who are capable of taking the statue and want a reward for their efforts will get shafted. Isn't that sort of selfish? The idea about a quest NPC spawning after the Statue dies, and turning an item in to trigger AoW is also a good suggestion. But where would you get such an item? Probably from the Statue. And if it was No Drop (as I'm sure something like would be) then you still havn't fixed the problem. Guilds capable of killing the Statue, will do so, loot the item and keep it in their treasury until they are ready to try the AoW. Would you expect them to allow a stronger guild to come in and loot that item? Not likely. I think you nailed it on the head when you suggested that they increase the despawn time of the AoW. That would solve all of the Players concerns, but then you might be infringing on the original intended design (courtesy of VI) of the whole challenge. <br>
<br>
My solutions were not silly. My ideas were specifically for dealing with the problem in its current state, and within the realm of the players' powers/rights/capabilities, whatever. <br>
<br>
&quot;we cannot have a force able to give a real (shot?) at AoW at any time. It's a very hard fight where we need our raid crew there..&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, completely agreed. I never suggested you have a force ready at all times to take him out. I suggested you have a force capable of taking AoW out, then claim, and kill then Vindicator and Statue yourselves, so you can guarentee your shot at the AoW. That only leaves the problem of guilds on southern hemisphere times, killing the statue during their hours, thus never allowing a guild on American/European time, to even have a shot at the statue during their regular hours. That seems to be the current problem for the most part.<br>
<br>
So the ideal solution would be to up the spawn rate of the Vindicator/Statue to twice its current rate. This would in effect double the chances of him being up during your playing time. American/Euro guilds would still be missing half of the potential spawns but that would occur during times that they aren't playing anyway. And it would allow everyone regardless of location to get at least one probable solid chance at taking him out. This would also still comply with the idea of having to kill the statue to get to the Avatar, as I beleive is the intended challenge. Of course there would still be arguments about the spawn never being up during American hours thanks to Euro guilds, and vice versa, but at least those two sets of hours, overlap somewhat. The problem is, does VI want to increase the drop rate of potential statue loot? BP of Erradication is nothing to laugh about.<br>
<br>
Again if a guild wants to try for the AoW, they should be prepared to deal with Vinidicator and statue as well. If he is never up during our hours, thats a problem VI has to fix. My ideas were for dealing with the situation in its current, fucked up form.<br>

Actually, they had a raid planned that day and people were logging on and assembling. They usually don't rush to do it because the people who want to be there generally talk to SOMEONE FIRST about working out a rotation, so they weren't expecting to have be in some sort of rush.

EV and Comps kill the statue all the time.  The statue isn't even a challenge for us.  The problem that Bacris and Karim are saying for Comps is, the Statue pops in the middle of the week.  Comps would like to have a weekend force to kill AoW because we would think we have the numbers on a weekend.  Other guilds kill Statue on a weekday.  Grats on wasted AoW.  It's not about what timezone the statue dies.  It's not about the Statue being part of the challenge (only takes 30 people to kill him).  The problem is amassing the proper classes and numbers on a weekday.<br>
<br>
As for making an agreement with other guilds to not touch the statue for 4 days straight, tons of guilds can kill the statue.  Asking each and every one of them to not kill it is, in my opinion, too selfish to even ask, let alone being extremely unrealistic.<br>

They expect any guild who is attempting the AoW to go through the the first two challenges before hand. Your *attempt* at the AoW is your reward for taking out Vindi and Statue. And his loot is your reward for *defeating him*. That would be my guess as to why he despawns so quickly. You're expected to combat all 3, sort of like an endurance test. I imagine defeating the Statue, and then only having an hour to prep and kill the Avatar was not a flaw in the mechanics of that challenge.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->According to your post, the problem is that the AoW despawns, so i'm saying that isn't the problem, the problem is how he is spawned.  There is no challenge in spawning him, neither at being ready for him, only luck in getting the statue at a time where it is possible for us to kill the AoW.  Like Makino said, the reason why your solutions are silly is because they would only work for when the statue spawns at a time we can kill it and have a force for AoW, if the statue spawns during that time, chances are we're going to be killing the statue anyway. <p><center><b>Baron Karim Mishakal &lt;The Companions&gt;<BR>Oracle of the Tribunal<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2978 target=window>My profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/usashanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sashanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lurker</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/12/02 3:46:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=712.topic&index=316>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SI - How Much Ass can you suck in one day?</span><hr size=1> Croneus,<br>

Seeing as you have all the solutions at your fingertips I would appreciate it if you would broker a seven guild - three time zone deal between EV / Companions / AN / RNG / SI / Transcended / Legendary to allow EV and Companions to take a shot at the AoW during their prime-time raid hours.<br>

I said it was the intention for that challenge associated with making him spawn. You decide when you spawn the Avatar, by when you kill the statue, so you are aware of the what will happen once he spawns and aware of when he will despawn. The problem, like I said, is getting claim to that initial challenge (Statue) so that you can prepare for it accordingly. The information I didn't know is what Makino mentioned, which helped clarify your post.<br>
<br>
Makino - I now understand what Bacris and Karim are arguing, but I admittedly do not understand the comments you made about the Statue. Why does he only spawn in the middle of week? Why can't his spawn time be manipulated to pop on weekends. Is he always killed as soon as he pops? I'm asking those questions seriously because I honestly didn't know that was the way it always worked. I was assuming (incorrectly it seems) that he was on a specific spawn time like everything else in EQ and could spawn on any day, provided he is killed accordingly. With the patch coming tommorow, could there be a way for one of the American/Euro guilds to kill the statue at an appropriate time that would eventually spawn future statues on a weekend? I mean it sucks that Comps can only amass the force needed for AoW on a weekend, but there are 5 weekdays that thousands of people, guilds play during, over dozens of servers, who might have a different &quot;convenient&quot; day in mind. They can't make the Statue a weekend only spawn, so I guess your telling me that if he can never spawn on the weekends, Companions will never, ever have a shot at the AoW. Is that what you are suggesting?<br>
<br>
