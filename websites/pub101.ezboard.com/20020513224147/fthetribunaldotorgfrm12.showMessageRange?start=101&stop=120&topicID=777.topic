For the most part, your account is plausible.  However:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The most obnoxious /ooc was some member of Transended /ooc &quot;thats right we said we would do anything to get the next Ragefire&quot; while the guild they ksed/took RF from was still rezzing the 50+ corpses on the wall.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is not neutral reporting.  &quot;Obnoxious&quot; and &quot;ksed/ took RF&quot; are where I take your bias from.  You're incorporating your personal views into your reporting, which the last time I checked, is a bias.  Furthermore, your bias favors Sentinels of Chaos, FOR GOOD OR BAD, and your bias is slanted towards the smaller guild.  Thus, I had every right to say you had a bias toward the smaller guild.<br>
<br>
Whether or not I consider your report valid is my prerogative.  Very few here agree with me, and that's okay.  But I am not necessarily &quot;wrong&quot; or a &quot;fuckhole&quot; for having this opinion.  I am a &quot;fuckhole&quot; because I have earned that right.<br>
<br>
Irwin, I flamed you because you are long-winded and exceedingly boring.  Really, I am glad I did because you got all up in arms over a little &quot;fuck you.&quot; Then, I gather that you cried some, then you probably indulged yourself with some Haagen Daas yogurt, then feeling that you were recovering your masculinity, you replied.  I read the first sentence then proceeded to dismiss the rest of your passage as the ramblings of a madman.<br>

<br>
I had a single group in Skyfire pulling crap while we waited for Rage to spawn.  He spawns, and a ranger in the group decided to get a closer look before I could tell him to stay away.  He ended up aggro'ing him....<br>
<br>
Yes, human version was kited around while we got people there.  Big mistake, and the ranger knows this now.<br>
<br>
I rushed things...Our failure was my mistake.  I didn't allow time for proper buffing.  Would we have taken him out with more preparation?  I don't know.  <br>
<br>
A few of the Transcended members were near us when we engaged, I, stupidly was bound close by.  When we got wiped out, Rage aggro'd on those members.  With all the summoning Rage was doing, There was no way that we could have gotten everyone ressed and back into the fight.  They finished him off after we had wiped.  They did not KS us, as some have said.  <br>
<br>
Being bound close by, when Rage went up and over the hill towards OT zone, I started ressing.  Rage came back and proceeded to eat us again while ressing.  If Transcended hadn't taken him down when they did, I don't think anyone would have gotten their epic that day.<br>
<br>
This was our first attempt at Ragefire as a guild.  We obviously made some mistakes...Most of which were done by myself.  The only blame I place is on myself for rushing the whole fight.  Ragefire was a learning experience for us.  Will we fail again?  Perhaps, but at least we now what to expect next time.<br>

I never said you were in trans fucktwit.  I said you were full of shit, and I stand by that.

As far as what amojo wrote, /cheer for being such a great sport about the whole thing.  Lemme tell you what happened in Kael tonight tho.  My guild (with some SoC people) took a stab at vindi.  We got him down to the &quot;D&quot; in his name, but wiped.  On his way back, he agroed E/V who were there to do AoW after we killed Vindi.  They finished him off.  Then they gave his loot to the raid that had taken him down to almost dead.  See, thats the difference between being a classless bunch of fucks, and a honorable guild.<br>

What you dimwits don't understand is that Flev is posting just to get reponses.  He could care less what the situation is or what the topic is.<br>
<br>
Ravlow does the same thing.  If you are too slack-jawed to understand that, then you probably need to go to a self-affirmation class ala Stewart Smalley.<br>
<br>
On the plus side, it is enjoyable to watch you ball-fisted dullards take the line and take out drag.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW Mojo, YOU BASTARD, you will kill this thread with all that honesty and honor.<br>

I  can tell that these flames are getting to ya.  Just wanted to advise you to put all this out of your mind when you log in.  Bringing it into the game tends to make it worse instead of better.  <br>
<br>
Dwelling on it to the point that you resort to weak flameage ingame puts you in the same class as loveseeker!  I know you don't wanna sink THAT low.<br>

This made me laugh almost as much as i did when you and your sidekick let everyone in kael know how much this shit has owned you.

I was in tells with 3 people who were there while it was going down, and they don't share mojo's opinion of the situation.  Whether he's right or not, these facts are indisputable:<br>
<br>
You changed your story several times on the thread, making you not only a dripping dick, but a lying dripping dick.<br>
<br>
At least one person in your party taunted SoC over you guys getting the pearl.<br>
<br>
SoC was pressured into spawning before they were ready by you breathing down their necks.<br>
<br>
You are a stupid cumguzzling queer who spends three nights a week sucking cock in a glory hole in a bus station.<br>
<br>
You've been driven to carry this thread into the game by your weak minded low self esteem.<br>
<br>
You've got your dog's cock up your ass right now while you're reading this.<br>
<br>
What Diel calls bringing it down to a level you'd understand, I call rising to the occasion.  Skull fucking rav in a flame requires calmly reasoned logic which would be wasted on a skidmark like you, so I just figured I'd tell it like it is here.  Your fantasies about having a dick long enough to slap people with and getting to do it to me aside, you're still not just a dumb faggot pusbag, but a cockheaded one to boot.<br>

If we aren't meeting your excellent standards of what is a &quot;good flame&quot; and a &quot;bad flame,&quot; by all means Mrs. Etiquette of the flameboard, tell us exactly just what is acceptable.  We will all become better people as a result of it, I am sure.<br>
