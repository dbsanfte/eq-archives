<br>
I believe that one of the most important and beneficial actions taken, which has affected the last decade and a half in an immense way, was the 1987 nomination of Alan Greenspan by Reagan.  Clinton did nothing for or to the economy because he did not have to - it's common sense that you don't tinker with something that's doing great already, as it had been ever since almost immediately after the 1992 election. (I think that's right, I wasn't paying much attention to these matters at the time.) Economic policy is not something that happens immediately... it takes months and more often years to see the effect of actions taken.<br>
<br>
Please show me what Clinton did that caused the 1990's boom.  Otherwise I grant him not an iota of credit, other than that he didn't screw it up.  Which is something, I guess.<br>
<br>
His foreign policy was atrocious.  From Somalia to Bosnia to the &quot;Apology to Africa&quot; tour, I shudder.  Jaeron has already gone over the terrorist issue.  The Mideast Peace deal had lovely intentions, but it's not going to happen no matter how &quot;close&quot; it might seem to come.  A waste of time even reasoning with Arafat.  But that's been discussed in another thread.<br>
<br>
Inclusive administration?  Two words... who cares?  Nominate and appoint the people who will do the best job, not someone who happens to be the right race or sex.  Even worrying about the (non)issue is bullshit, imo.<br>
<br>
My broad, sweeping analysis:  Clinton is an egotistical, avaricious man who nevertheless had good intentions for the United States.  He wanted to do good, but his warped ideology (there's my conservative bias), worthless character (lying, in office, under oath is enough to disgust me completely), and simple lack of opportunities due to general peace, prosperity, and divided government kept him from having an impact on much of anything except the front page of the tabloids.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah... I almost forgot.  His half-dismantlement of the armed forces is one huuuuge strike against him in my book.  Raise taxes while cutting the military enormously?  /boggle... priorities in ALL the wrong places.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Just read your last post, Loegan.  I'm just wondering, are a lot of these more minor laws actually Clinton's work, or that of Democratic elements in Congress?  I don't know at all, which is why I'm asking. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

Very good points, most of which I agree with with -but- (and there is always a but isn't there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) you left out one very important factor. Clinton balanced the budget which helped the stock market which improves the economy overall. While I agree 100% that Clinton had a good economic enviroment to work within, I think it is a disservice to imply he just took a hands off approach and rode the wave. IMO he took advanatge of the situation and used it to balance the budget (which is not an easy thing even in the best of climates) and maximized the benefits. <p><br>

<br>
Because one advanced tank can't be in two places at the same time.  How about 3 or 4 advanced tanks instead of 5 old ones?  Right now, if we were to be somehow involved in a two front war, which is far from impossible, we would not be able to field the forces necessary.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clinton balanced the budget which helped the stock market which improves the economy overall.&quot;<br>
<br>
And how did he balance the budget, mon ami?  By raising taxes and cutting the military, among other things.  *chuckle*<br>
<br>
There are some things I think Clinton did right... NAFTA (which also helped the economy - you have an excellent point there which you failed to mention) and welfare reform are two good examples.  But these, and other good decisions he made, simply do not outweigh the bad, imo.  Hell, even if he had been a genious and implemented the greatest policies every known to man, the simple fact that he lied under oath is enough to throw him into the political dumpster of my mind, so to speak.  The whole Lewinsky affair etc. leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but I could have gotten over it if he had just come clean about it.  But to lie, under oath, to every American citizen?  The President!?  Whether it was his private business or not makes not an iota of difference, because what matters is his perjury.  The rest is just sad window dressing.  It wouldn't have mattered if the President had been caught breaking one of those ridiculous blue laws like &quot;Thou shalt not fart on the left side of the street in Waxahachi Wisconsin after noon but before the ducks walk the streets.&quot;  If he lied under oath about it, I'd still be just as pissed.<br>

I am afraid that you won't find many presidents that will meet your standards then. Politics is a dirty game and if you rise to the level of president it is almost 100% certain that you have bent or broke some rules along the way imo.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> But to lie, under oath, to every American citizen?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The polls showed it wasn't the American citizens who wanted to know - It was congress. A majority of the public felt that it was none of our business and wanted the whole thing dropped. And let's not forget what the original mission of the Independent Counsel was and that the Lewinsky matter had nothing what-so-ever to do with that.<br>
<br>
So while you may believe that what Clinton did was shameful, I would contend that there is plenty of shame to go around when it comes to the handling of that whole mess. <p><br>

<br>
Loegan....Even defending Clinton you have to admit he did not just trim the fat...He screwed the military up really really bad. Bush has spent the last year piecing it back together and its still only a shadow of its former self. Some cut backs could have been made yes, However he nearly killed it.<br>
<br>
He had no right as the commander and chief to do some of the things he did....Like it or not he did sell secrets to china..Even if they were out of date missile specs they were still far more advanced then china had. Also the naval war ship that was hit by the dingy with bombs on it was horrible. You have no right sending men and women into a dangerous place without the ability to defend themselves. Say what you like about him but he was the worst military leader this country could have had.<br>

You could quote me from the &quot;The President Should Have Known&quot; thread, and it will look like I'm completely contradicting myself.  The difference, to me, is the motivation... Clinton lied under oath to save his own pathetic hide, not for the good of the nation or anyone but himself.  That is what I find disgusting.  Besides, even you ought to be able to admit that if he had just come clean about it, apologized, and said &quot;Lets move on.&quot;, then the majority of the public as well as Congress would have had nothing to go on.  You can't impeach someone for adultery... perjury is another matter, though.<br>
<br>
&quot;A majority of the public felt that it was none of our business and wanted the whole thing dropped.&quot;<br>
<br>
The majority of the public are unbelievably ignorant.  Call me elitist, but I know for a fact that it is amazingly easy to go through high school and even college without having a single clue how the government is run, or any of the principles behind it.  A lot of people do it... and then go vote when Politician X, Y or Z gnaws on their heartstrings enough.  9/10ths of politics is playing on the emotions of ignorant sheep.<br>
<br>
Solovey has an excellent point, btw... you will never hear it, because it is forbidden for any military officer in uniform to criticize their leaders publically.  But walk up to one on the street and ask their opinion, and I can all but guarantee that they will have harsh words about Mr. Clinton.  At least that's been the general opinion of every officer I've ever met... my father is an officer, but he was assigned to largely off-base posts for the last fifteen years, so when I was living with my parents I didn't get much chance to interact with any enlisted. <p>Caledhon TelRana - 53 Warrior<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51701">

Bush Sr. was the one who started the drawdown.  It started right after the Gulf War.  Yes the cuts continued but that REPUBLICAN majority in congress he faced for most of his office didn't put up much an argument.<br>
<br>
Also as to what Clinton did or did not do militarily.  All you seem to forget how much flak he took for evrey damn military action he took.  There was not the public support that is critical to do any more.  If Clinton had tried to actually go to war over the first WTC bombing there would have been dman near a revolt.<br>
<br>
We don't NEED a huge military like we had before and we can no longer afford it.  It IS too small but it also needs to be fundamentally changed.  We don't use a whole hell of a lot of tanks in Afganistan.  What we face is a lot of small brushfire and &quot;special ops&quot; type missions.  It needs to be a far more mobile and flexible force.   We do need a small core of a traditional army however but no where near what we have.<br>
