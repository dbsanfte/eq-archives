<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Politics of Mass Destruction<br>
<br>
BY RICHARD SPERTZEL<br>
Sunday, June 29, 2003 12:01 a.m. EDT<br>
<br>
Even as evidence is uncovered that Saddam Hussein was planning to revive his nuclear-weapons program at the earliest possible date, politicians and pundits alike lament the failure of coalition forces to find a &quot;smoking gun.&quot; Despite the recent discovery of plans and parts for a uranium-enrichment centrifuge, some presidential candidates have accused the Bush administration of lying about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction to justify the war with Iraq.<br>
<br>
Such assertions ignore all that has been learned and has transpired during the past 12-plus years. As I've said time and again, expecting any inspection regime to find a massive cache of WMDs is a lesson in self-delusion. Such folly can only bring cheer to those who opposed the war in the first place and to those who simply oppose the Bush administration.<br>
<br>
Recall that during the first Gulf War, Iraq stored its biological-agent-filled munitions in pits dug in the sand or in abandoned railroad tunnels. Such sites are not easily found. Good intelligence emanating from those Iraqi personnel responsible for the deployment, protection and control of such storage sites will be required. Indeed, it was an Iraqi scientist who last week led coalition forces to the site where the uranium-enrichment equipment was buried. But many WMD personnel were part of the Special Security Organization under Saddam's younger son, Qusay. The information is not likely to be obtained easily.<br>
<br>
Some pundits question, if Iraq had WMDs, why did it not use them? Iraq learned from the first Gulf War that coalition forces headed by the U.S. could advance very rapidly. Iraq also indicated in testimony to the U.N. Special Commission, or Unscom, that biological weapons would have little effect in stopping an advancing military force. Rather, their interest was to use biological weapons to intimidate their neighbors and cause them to &quot;see things Iraq's way.&quot; Thus its failure to use biological WMDs should not be a surprise to anyone. The failure to use chemical WMDs is also not surprising considering the apparent confusion within the Iraqi command structure during the race to Baghdad.<br>
<br>
Then, why have such weapons not been found? The answer may lie in the training and experience of the inspectors. The initial team looking for WMDs in Iraq was more reminiscent of site exploiters than inspectors. True, if they found a bomb or missile warhead, they were capable of further exploitation of the find to determine its contents. But they apparently did not have testing instruments capable of detecting trace amounts of biological-weapons agents.<br>
<br>
The next iteration of the coalition inspectors was supposed to have a number of inspectors that had extensive experience in Iraq and has been so misrepresented in the media. I was asked in February to propose a list of Unscom experienced biological inspectors (a so-called A team) that had multiple inspection trips to Iraq. <br>
<br>
These were to be from the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. In March, after the concept was approved, I was asked to contact those on my list to assure they were willing and able to devote the time. All but one agreed to the deployment. None of the individuals on that list ever made it to Iraq.<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago David Albright, writing in the Washington Post, stated that he had been contacted by several Iraqi nuclear scientists who asserted that they were afraid to talk to the coalition inspectors because of the way they were being treated by the inspectors--interrogation, threats, etc., rather than with any degree of respect. The interviewing of Iraqi scientists is where extensive experience would have been most valuable. One doesn't need to like what was done or the individual scientist to treat them with respect. Experienced inspectors knew this. Furthermore, experienced inspectors knew what, when, and how to pursue a subject that is unlikely to occur to a neophyte.<br>
<br>
There is nothing that the U.S. could threaten the Iraqi scientists with that could approach what they've endured these past 30 to 40 years. A scientist I remain in contact with had been imprisoned by Iraq for 17 months in the 1990s. In early March this year, with tensions building, he was again arrested for fear he would disclose information Iraq did not want disclosed.<br>
<br>
It is encouraging that the third and current iteration under the CIA is headed by David Kay, which may account for the recent breakthrough in uncovering the uranium-enrichment plans. In regard to other WMDs, Iraq imported or retained over the last several years key pieces of equipment that could not readily be carried off by looters. If located, extensive intrusive sampling with the right test system might tell wonders about Iraq's biological-weapons programs.<br>
<br>
Let there be no doubt, Iraq retained an active biological-weapons program. Unscom had adequate evidence of such. In 1998, presented with the evidence, the leading biological-weapons experts from the U.S., U.K., Russia, France, Sweden, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, Ukraine, Romania and Canada all agreed with the Unscom findings and observations. Incredibly, much of the U.S. and British public and politicians with little or no knowledge of biological weapons and biological warfare are choosing to believe otherwise.<br>

<br>
By Rolf Ekeus<br>
June 29, 2003<br>
<br>
THE HAGUE<br>
With no weapons of mass destruction as yet found in Iraq, the political criticism directed against President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair is mounting. <br>
<br>
Before the war, the two leaders publicly declared that the Iraqi regime had not only procured and produced such weapons but still retained them with the intention to use them. This was considered a good reason for a military operation against Iraq -- an outright casus belli.<br>
<br>
A United Nations inspection team, before the war, and the U.S. military, after the war, have been searching Iraq and have not come up with anything that can remotely be called weapons of mass destruction. Is it now time to join the game of blaming Bush and Blair for an illegitimate or illegal war? Let us first consider some facts in a complicated picture<br>
<br>
Chemical weapons were used by Iraq in its war against Iran (1980-8<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Arguably that use had a decisive effect on the outcome: It saved Iraq from being overwhelmed by a much larger Iranian army. Furthermore, Iraq made use of chemical bombs in air raids against the Kurdish civilian population in northern Iraq. <br>
<br>
Nerve gases, such as sarin, and mustard gas immediately and painfully killed many thousands of civilians. More than 100,000 later died or were crippled by the aftereffects.<br>
<br>
These reminders illustrate that Iraq's acquisition and use of chemical weapons were carried out in pursuit of two strategic goals, namely to halt Iran's possible expansion of its sphere of influence in the Persian Gulf region and to suppress internal opposition. The war started by Iraq in 1980 was directed against its historical enemy, Iran. In strategic terms and over generations, Iraq/Mesopotamia had been positioned as a gatekeeper of the Arab nation against repeated Persian expansion westward, a threat that had become acute with the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. All the emirates and states in the gulf region, ruled by Arabs of traditionalist Sunni Muslim orientation, considered Persian nationalism and expansionism a constant problem, especially after Iran's Shiite revolution.<br>
<br>
For Saddam Hussein, the self-styled, self-promoted defender of the Arab nation, &quot;the Iranian beasts,&quot; to quote Tariq Aziz in a conversation with me -- not the <br>
<br>
United States or Israel -- were the eternal enemy of Iraq. With its population of more than 64 million, Iran constituted a challenge that Iraq, with its 24 million inhabitants, could not match with conventional military means. By using chemical weapons to gas and kill the &quot;human waves&quot; of young, poorly protected Iranian attack forces, the Iraqi army repeatedly saved itself from being overwhelmed. And thus it became conventional wisdom, nourished by the Iraqi leadership, that only nonconventional weapons could guarantee that Iraq would prevail in an armed conflict with Iran.<br>
<br>
Regarding biological weapons, the U.N. inspection team, UNSCOM, managed after four years of investigation to confirm the existence in Iraq of a major secret biological weapons program. This led in August 1995 to the defection from Iraq of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law Hussein Kamal, director of Iraq's WMD programs. During UNSCOM's debriefings in Iraq after the defection, Iraqi biological weapons scientists, able to speak slightly more openly than normally, explained that their secret work mainly was on assignments to find means for warfare against the Iranians.<br>
<br>
Regarding the nuclear weapons projects, the Iraqi authorities defended their systematic violation of Iraq's obligations under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with the proposition that Iran, likewise a party to the treaty, was active in developing its own nuclear weapons. Iraq's obsession with Iran was illustrated by its air attack in 1983 on the Iranian nuclear reactors at Busher.<br>
<br>
Even the quite remarkable missile developments in Iraq were related to Iran. Iraq succeeded in modifying and re-engineering many hundreds of the more than 800 Scud missiles bought from the Soviet Union -- increasing their range of 200-300 kilometers to 500-600 kilometers, sufficient to reach Tehran.<br>
<br>
In sum, all four components of Iraq's prohibited and secret WMD program were motivated and inspired by its structural enmity and rivalry with Iran. Thus, during the Gulf War in 1991, Iraq did not use its readily available chemical weapons, stored in considerable quantities in southern Iraq, against the U.S.-led forces.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi leadership made clear to me that there would have been no military sense in using chemical weapons on such a fast-developing battlefield, where the enemy was highly mobile, well trained and well equipped for chemical warfare. In addition, the Iraqi willingness to use chemical weapons had been tempered by U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's promise to Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz that such a contingency would change the U.S. war aim from the liberation of Kuwait to regime change in Iraq.<br>
<br>
The fact that Iraq in the recent war did not counter the coalition forces, now even better trained and equipped than last time, with chemical weapons should not have come as a surprise. The chemical weapons, like the other WMD, had been developed with another enemy in mind. But a big question remains about the puzzling absence of chemical weapons in Iraq. <br>
<br>
Detractors of Bush and Blair have tried to make political capital of the presumed discrepancy between the top-level assurances about Iraq's possession of chemical weapons (and other WMD) and the inability of invading forces to find such stocks. The criticism is a distortion and trivialization of a major threat to international peace and security.<br>
<br>
During its war against Iran, Iraq found that chemical warfare agents, especially nerve agents such as sarin, soman, tabun and later VX, deteriorated after just a couple of weeks' storage in drums or in filled chemical warfare munitions. The reason was that the Iraqi chemists, lacking access to high-quality laboratory and production equipment, were unable to make the agents pure enough. (UNSCOM found in 1991 that the large quantities of nerve agents discovered in storage in Iraq had lost most of their lethal property and were not suitable for warfare.)<br>
<br>
Thus the Iraqi policy after the Gulf War was to halt all production of warfare agents and to focus on design and engineering, with the purpose of activating production and shipping of warfare agents and munitions directly to the battlefield in the event of war. Many hundreds of chemical engineers and production and process engineers worked to develop nerve agents, especially VX, with the primary task being to stabilize the warfare agents in order to optimize a lasting lethal property. Such work could be blended into ordinary civilian production facilities and activities, e.g., for agricultural purposes, where batches of nerve agents could be produced during short interruptions of the production of ordinary chemicals.<br>
<br>
This combination of researchers, engineers, know-how, precursors, batch production techniques and testing is what constituted Iraq's chemical threat -- its chemical weapon. The rather bizarre political focus on the search for rusting drums and pieces of munitions containing low-quality chemicals has tended to distort the important question of WMD in Iraq and exposed the American and British administrations to unjustified criticism.<br>
<br>
The real chemical warfare threat from Iraq has had two components. One has been the capability to bring potent chemical agents to the battlefield to be used against a poorly equipped and poorly trained enemy. The other is the chance that Iraqi chemical weapons specialists would sign up with terrorist networks such as al Qaeda -- with which they are likely to have far more affinity than do the unemployed Russian scientists the United States worries about.<br>
<br>
In this context the remnants of Iraq's biological weapons program, and specifically its now-unemployed specialists, constitute a potential threat of much the same magnitude. While biological weapons are not easily adapted for battlefield use, they are potentially the more devastating as a means for massive terrorist onslaught on civilian targets.<br>
<br>
As with chemical weapons, Iraq's policy on biological weapons was to develop and improve the quality of the warfare agents. It is possible that Iraq, in spite of its denials, retained some anthrax in storage. But it could be more problematic and dangerous if Iraq secretly maintained a research and development capability, as well as a production capability, run by the biologists involved in its earlier programs. Again, such a complete program would in itself constitute a more important biological weapon than some stored agents of doubtful quality.<br>
<br>
It is understandable that the U.N. inspectors and even more, the military search teams, have had difculty penetrating the sophisticated, well-rehearsedand protected WMD program in Iraq. The task was made infinitely more challenging by the fact that Iraq was, and indeed still is, a &quot;republic of fear.&quot; Through my indirect contact with some senior Iraqi weapons scientists, I have been given to understand that the reign of terror is still in place.<br>
<br>
Outsiders who have not dealt with Iraq cannot easily understand the extent to which the terror of the Hussein years has penetrated that unhappy nation. As long as Hussein and his sons are not apprehended or proven dead, few if any of those involved in the weapons program will provide information on their activities. The risk of terrible revenge against oneself or one's family is simply too great. The first point on a WMD agenda must be to create a safe environment free from the remnants of terror.<br>
<br>
The chemical and biological warfare structures in Iraq constitute formidable international threats through potential links to international terrorism. Before the war these structures were also major threats against Iran and internally against Iraq's own Kurdish and Shiite populations, as well as Israel.<br>
<br>
The Iraqi nuclear weapons projects lacked access to fissile material but were advanced with regard to weapon design. Here again, competition with Iran was a driving factor. Iran, as a major beneficiary of the fall of Hussein, has now been given an excellent opportunity to rethink its own nuclear weapons program and its other WMD activities.<br>
<br>
The door is now open for diplomatic initiatives to remake the region into a WMD-free area and to shape a structure in the Persian Gulf of stability and security. <br>
<br>
Moreover, the defeat of the Hussein regime, a deadly opponent to peace between Israelis and Palestinians, has opened the door to a realistic and re-energized peace process in the Middle East.<br>
<br>
This is enough to justify the international military intervention undertaken by the United States and Britain. To accept the alternative -- letting Hussein remain in power with his chemical and biological weapons capability -- would have been to tolerate a continuing destabilizing arms race in the gulf, including future nuclearization of the region, threats to the world's energy supplies, leakage of WMD technology and expertise to terrorist networks, systematic sabotage of efforts to create and sustain a process of peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the continued terrorizing of the Iraqi people.<br>

This sounds just like one of those foreigners who thinks that the U.S. needs to justify their actions to them.<br>
<br>
WAKE UP AND SMELL THE NAPALM!<br>
<br>
We don't care what you think about us.  We could care less if you are not happy with the way we run things (and yes, we do run things).  Bush has been criticized for being a poor diplomat, but from a certain point of view, his strategy could be thought of as a stroke of genius.<br>
<br>
The U.S. is now free from the yoke of international politics.  When the next crisis comes along, we don't have to worry what the collective opinion of the intelligent, educated, informed, and un-biased world population is.  We can ignore all that and do what is right.<br>
<br>
Want to know why Chirac isn't hopping around the EU, announcing to the world how much he opposed the war?  It's because the French citizens are beginning to realize that their leader was using the situation as a means to gain political power.  He didn't really care about Iraq, he only cared about positioning himself correctly.<br>
<br>
He'll probably get re-elected.  And France is welcome to assume the leadership role in the U.N.  We can move the whole thing to France.  The U.N. can go about its debating and posturing in Paris, protected from the millions of radical Muslims by the speed bump that is the French military. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shehbahn>shehbahn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No blood for oil!</span><br>  Posts: 1057<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/30/03 10:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=210>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <br>
Tell you what : the one who's got an election coming up is Bush in 2004. Blair doesn't sound in too good a spot at the moment either. Chirac on the other hand is sitting tight until 2007... so i don't think he's all that worried about getting support just yet. What he is a lot more worried about is his buddies at Elf / Fina <br>
<br>
&gt;protected from the millions of radical Muslims by the speed bump that is the French military.<br>
<br>
He's already got 10 millions of them (out of 55) right within his borders to contend with, and so do most EU countries. That's why you had hard right wingers neo-fascists scoring so high in elections all over europe for the last five years.<br>

Weee ! We'll see the accuracy of this in a couple of years... right now the arms race is kicking in high gear all around the world again.<br>

It seems you are failing to take into consideration that many of the al-Qaeda that have been captured and bank accounts seized/frozen is due to co-operation form other countries.<br>
<br>
We had enormous good will and support from the global community after 9/11 and near 100% backing in going after al-Qaeda in Afghanistan because we were in the right. To blow all that just so Bush Jr could settle a score with Saddam was stupid and a tragic waste of global unity towards a worth while goal.<br>
<br>
I don't think alot of Americans realize just what a bad a spot OBL was in after 9/11. He was forced underground and global sentiment had greatly damaged their recruiting potential. Once Bush started his cruesade against Iraq though, recruiting went through the roof to the point they had to turn people away. <br>
<br>
Now we are dealing with Iraqi resistance which is eating up huge amounts of resources and will continue to do so for years to come. Not to mention the moral booster to terrorist organizations from hearing about the death of American soldiers almost every day in Iraq.<br>
<br>
Maybe there would have been a point in time when going into Iraq would have made sense, but I fail to see how that was the case now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#4D4D4D><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You lookin' at me?</span><br>  Posts: 1447<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/30/03 11:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=212>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Once Bush started his cruesade against Iraq though, recruiting went through the roof to the point they had to turn people away.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

How has this been changed or been &quot;blown&quot; since Bush's &quot;crusade&quot;? After our &quot;crusade&quot; Saudi Arabia has actually increased what little cooperation they had provided, Pakistan is apparently the main country in hunting bin Laden, Germany is still picking up terrorists and sharing intel, Putin and Bush are still admiring each other's eyes during brunch and terrorist discussion. What massive political tragedy has the US suffered since the Iraq war that has destroyed our ability in dealing with terrorists? I am honestly failing to see how this 'global unity towards the worthwhile goal' of going after terrorists has been hindered. Various nation's opinion polls have shifted to an unfavorable view of the US but so far I see only increasing support of US actions outside of Iraq, whether it be the war on terror, Israel/Palestine, or Kofi Annan begging us to get actively involved in various situations throughout the world.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=telkandoretelenesis>Telkandore Telenesis</A> at: 6/30/03 1:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=walkabout>Walkabout</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I read boards more<br>than I play EQ....</span><br>  Posts: 541<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/30/03 1:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=674.topic&index=213>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I just hope Bush gets reelected <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
