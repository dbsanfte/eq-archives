I could go on almost ENDLESSLY about the atrocities he commited, but why bother?  You're slapping hands because the &quot;proper channels&quot; weren't followed, or because you refuse to believe the war had any justification, outside oil.  I quite frankly don't care about the reasons, because I DO believe the end justifies the means in cases of such extreme violations of Human rights.<br>

I very clearly remember the African-American Army spokesman (sorry dont know name) appearing on Fox news and saying that &quot;all bets are off&quot; if the Iraqis used those weapons.&quot;<br>
<br>
The US policy toward weapons of mass destruction is quite clear.  <br>
<br>
-We will not use any weapon of mass destruction first.<br>
-If a weapon of mass destruction is used it will be responded to with the use of Nuclear weapons if the situation is appropriate. <br>
-All Nuclear, Chemical and Biological weapons are considered weapons of mass destruction.<br>
<br>
To be honest, bio/chem weapons are fairly inefficient compared to a small arty delivered nuke.  They are a pain in the ass to employ, and in a region like Iraq, the winds can change your plans in a hurry.  It is also rarely beneficial for the attacking forces to use a Bio/Chem weapon.  Most effective Bio/Chem is a persistant agent.  It remains on the terrain and is capable of causing new casulties more than 24 hours after delivery.  Now, I don't know about you, but using that on troops that tend to be in the same area that US troops are moving into seems rather foolish.  So not only is the use of Bio/Chem against long standing US policy, it is fairly stupid tactically.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;(6) Despite thousands of Coalition troops searching Iraq, NOTHING has been found except for these residual traces which very well could have been there for decades.&quot;<br>
<br>
That one is just plain wrong.  I hate to break it to you, but when the military says &quot;we found traces and are doing further tests&quot;  it does not mean that we are sticking a piece of paper in the can and calling it nerve gas.  The tests take, for most agents, longer than this war has been going on.  It could be done faster, but when they are shipped back to the CDC for testing, they take their time to make sure they are 100% right before any official announcement is made. <br>
<br>
<br>
As for Pine Bluff, you are partially right again.  They do develop chem weapons for the purposes of testing.  And they are the reason that we have such good protective suits.  And stop watching so many movies, nerve gas is a fucking joke now days.  It takes far to much inhaled to kill a person and it is one of the easiest types of chem weapons to detect. <br>

<br>
Don't lump Bio/chemical weapons together. <br>
<br>
You are right, chemical weapons are expensive to make, hard to deploy, easy to have it not work.<br>
<br>
Biological weapons are easy to make, transport, and release.<br>
<br>
A successful release of bio-weapons can have a major impact. The aim of a successful bio-weapons release is to inflict panic, more then damage.<br>
<br>
Just because a country says they do not have WMD does not mean they don't have them right? That is why we went into Iraq. The former Soviet Union did the same thing. Therefore, it is equally as likely the US has WMD besides nuclear weapons. <br>
<br>
Given that other countries DO have them leads me to think the US does as well. There is no way they will let any country have the leg up on them in terms of weapons, or weapons research.<br>

Did it ever occur to you that the best way to test anti-NBC technology or agents is to test it against those weapons in a limited capacity?

<br>
At what point is it clear beyond a doubt who will win?  Most people tend to agree that is when someone surrenders.  And don't forget that Hindsight is 20/20, I am sure the people in Germany at the time would have argued that while they were being shot at the damn thing sure as hell wasn't beyond a doubt over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Droping the A-Bomb on Japan a second time. Once was enough to ensure surender, the second time was for research.&quot;<br>
<br>
If the first was enough, Japan would have surrendered.  The emperor of Japan refused to surrender so another was dropped.  It is not as if they didn't have a chance to surrender, they weren't exactly dropped 30 seconds apart.<br>
<br>
&quot;Orchestrating the overthrowing of Chilean Democraticaly elected President.&quot;<br>
<br>
Don't be to free with the words democratically elected.  Saddam won 100% of the popular vote last year in his last election.<br>
<br>
&quot;Support for questionable groups like: Contras, early bin-Ladin, early Taliban, Turkey (who have helped more Kurds to disapear the Suddam) Israel whom have been carrying on active aparthied since 1945.&quot;<br>
<br>
Interesting argument.  You did forget to mention that they were supported against Russia who was in the middle of occupying Afghanistan.  That might be a key point seeing as it was during the middle of the cold war.  I do agree with you on the contras however.<br>
<br>
&quot;Selling Suddam Bio/chemical weapons, who then used them on the Kurds.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blatantly false, we sell alot of weapons to alot of people, but I have yet to hear anyone with any reliable information ever say we have sold Bio/Chem to anyone.  Prove it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keeping Suddam in power for 20 of his 30 years.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, this one is just odd.  I am trying to figure out what you support here.  Most people that bring up the rest of the points you mentioned tend to have favored us leaving him in power longer.  I agree we fucked up here though.  But if we had gone in 20 years earlier, you would list it along with overthrowing other people.<br>
<br>
&quot;The weekly bombing of Iraq since the Gulf War.&quot;<br>
<br>
Odd how you don't mention Iraq's daily violation of the treaty that ended the last gulf war and made such bombings needed.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, as to your bio/chem points, you are correct, they should not be heaped together.<br>
<br>
Bio-You are partially right here.  Bio weapons are easy to make if you want crappy ones.  Alot of people are stuck on Anthrax and others of that type.  It is very very easy to create anthrax, but it is not easy to make a highly leathel version of it.  The same applies for many other types.  Are they easy to employ/transport?  Yes, on civilian targets.  A well prepared military target is almost impossible to hit with any sort of effective bio weapons.<br>
<br>
Chem- Slightly more complex to make, but easier to make leathel varieties than Bio.  There are very few known agents which have even the slightest chance of penetrating a bio/chem suit, and it can be said with some certainty that Iraq does not have the scientists or facilities to produce them.  These are much more effective on a military target than civilian, but poorly suited toward use in the desert.  Wind patterns are to unpredicatble and to be honest, sand sucks for chem agents.  These also tend to be far easier to detect than bio agents.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I do agree also that anyone who didn't believe that the US had such weapons is naive.  I hope to God that we have the best god damn bio/chem weapons in the world.  I hope that they test our suits and masks with them as well.  I want to be sure that my suit is good not only against what I know the enemy has but what I don't know about too. <br>
<br>
That said, I think it is insane to say, you have those weapons too, you are just as wrong.  For instance, there is a difference between producing these items for weapons research and producing 250 Metric TONS of just one compound. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Psy<br>
(Oh yeah, the reason I didn't debate the other points that you mention about past US wrongs, is that I quite simply do not know enough to argue about them).<br>

The US declares war and doesn't need hard proof?  Listen to yourself.  Maybe you can wake up from your lala-land lull that the people around you and the media has pumped into your head and realize what an absurd statement that is.<br>
<br>
As for my supposedly ignorant statements in regards to Desert Storm and why they didn't topple the regime:  You claim the US couldn't do it because that is what the UN decided, not the US.  Yet, as I recall, this war was conducted against the wishes of the UN.  Perhaps you weren't clear on that or are you fucked in the head?  In other words, you are saying it must have been not ok to ignore the UN in the 90s, but it is perfectly ok in this day and age to ignore the UN.  Yes, this makes perfect sense.<br>
<br>
As for you people saying embargos are useless, that is why the majority of the oil fields in Iraq have deteriorated into non-operational status?  Yes, I'm sure if Iraq could so easily sell this oil for cheap, as everyone is claiming, it would make perfect sense to let the majority of your infrastructure to rot away.<br>

PS As a side note to the discussion, someone's examination of the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan and how the 2nd was dropped because the Emperor refused to surrender Japan is inaccurate and a supreme oversimplification of the situation.  In addition, the Tokyo Firebombing raid conducted by Allied forces killed many many more (more than 2 times I think) men women and children than both atomic bombs combined.   <p>&lt;hr&gt;<br>

Records available from the supplier for the period from 1985 until the present show that during this time, pathogenic (meaning &quot;disease producing&quot;), toxigenic (meaning &quot;poisonous&quot;), and other biological research materials were exported to Iraq pursuant to application and licensing by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Records prior to 1985 were not available, according to the supplier. These exported biological materials were not attenuated or weakened and were capable of reproduction. According to the Department of Defense's own Report to Congress on the Conduct of the Persian Gulf War, released in April 1992: &quot;By the time of the invasion of Kuwait, Iraq had developed biological weapons. It's advanced and aggressive biological warfare program was the most advanced in the Arab world... The program probably began late in the 1970's and concentrated on the development of two agents, botulinum toxin and anthrax bacteria... Large-scale production of these agents began in 1989 at four facilities near Baghdad. Delivery means for biological agents ranged from simple aerial bombs and artillery rockets to surface-to-surface missiles.&quot; [55] <br>
<br>
Included in the approved sales are the following biological materials (which have been considered by various nations for use in war), with their associated disease symptoms:[56] <br>
<br>
Bacillus Anthracis: anthrax is a disease producing bacteria identified by the Department of Defense in The Conduct of the Persian Gulf War: Final Report to Congress, as being a major component in the Iraqi biological warfare program. <br>
<br>
Anthrax is an often-fatal infectious disease due to ingestion of spores. It begins abruptly with high fever, difficulty in breathing, and chest pain. The disease eventually results in septicemia (blood poisoning), and the mortality is high. Once septicemia is advanced, antibiotic therapy may prove useless, probably because the exotoxins remain, despite the death of the bacteria. <br>

<br>
My post on the 2nd atomic bomb was not false or oversimplification. The decision to drop a second bomb on Nagasaki (sp?) was no more then that. The pilots flying in the second bomb droped it well off target, it was intended to be droped inside the city center. They droped it out in a Rural area of the city. This cut down on the effectivness of the bomb. <br>
<br>
Hiroshima bomb ~ 14 Kilotons.<br>
<br>
Nagasaki ~ 20 Kilotons.<br>
<br>
I guess the only simplified thing I omited was that the bomb, both the first and second was also directed at the Soviet Union, not just Japan. <br>
<br>
The US wanted to stop the SU from entering the Pacific theater at all costs, enough that they droped two A-bombs.<br>
<br>
There is no doubt that its use saved American lives, and ended the war weeks or months early, but again Japan was defeated. It would have been bloody, but there was no way Japan was going to win at that point.<br>
<br>
I agree that fire bombing killed more people, partly due to the construction of buildings in Japanese cities. It also occured in Germany. Incindiary bombing was occuring when victory was certain.<br>
<br>
Victory is assured?<br>
<br>
Well when all the armies had entered Germany and were on their way to Berlin, I call that when the results of war are certain. I doubt Germany could have pushed the Allied armies back at that point.<br>
<br>
The US army was talking about how the war was over before it had even begun. As soon as the US army crossed over into Iraq did any of us doubt that you would win? Maybe more casualties, but victory was never really a question.<br>
<br>
So yes, when the Allies started testing incindiary bombs on German and Japanese cities in late WWII victory was already assured, it was only when. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg.showUserPublicProfile?gid=makino>Makino</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Flowers Before Boys</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/18/03 11:31 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://roforums.dhs.org/phpBB/images/avatars/gallery/Avatars/mage-female.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You fucking assholes</span><hr size=1> I said inaccurate, not false.

Providing proof against peoples misfired allegations is good for public opinion at least.<br>

So far though all I have seen is a bunch of shit about how the US has provided weapons for blah blah blah....or the US has helped to everthrow blah blah blah...<br>
<br>
Show me where the US decided that the people of a different ethnic or religious backround other than the Ruling class decided (in a state sponsored act) that those people are worthless and deserve to die.<br>
<br>
Show me where the US has decided that your Freedom to do worship a God, or back a political opponent, or speak your mind in a public place (without infringing on the rights of others like stupid traffic blocking fucks) has EVER been even frowned upon by the Administration you so hate.<br>
<br>
See in the US we have Plausibly deniability over time.  All the shit that was overthrown, or sold to another country and misused, or percieved globally as bad foriegn policy will go away when 'Dubya' gets VOTED out of office in a perfectly legal and constitutional election.<br>
<br>
How long has Jaque Chirac been -not only- in power in France, but courting the Iraqi's...namely Saddam Hussien?  I'll give you a hint...it was more than 15 years.  Won't see that type of influence over world events by one man happen in America EVER.  And there's a Reason for it.  <br>

<br>
At least I'm not 'parroting' falsehoods.<br>
<br>
Funny how you decide to flame me for not haveing any brains when the whole post you put up there was nothing but one big half assed insult, containing nothing to back up your claim that the UN was opposed to war in Iraq back in 1991.<br>
<br>
I don't like the US Government, I don't like the war in Iraq, I don't like some of the things the US has done over the past few hundred years.  However I dislike even more when ignorant retards like yourself have to attempt to spread falsehoods to try and prove a point that has nothing to do with the issue at hand.<br>
<br>
If your gonna flame it then at least point out one of my 'parroted' tidbits that is indeed false.  Or would that take up too much of your enormous mental might?<br>
<br>
And Sashanna...<br>
<br>
It has been ONE FUCKING MONTH...give it time and I am sure they will find something...and even if they don't I (not because the US governtment says so) am convinced that they had it by facts shown over the last few months from any number of sources, as well as (like I said earlier) the fact that I am reasonably sure that the US government woulnd't have gone in there and risked losing the moral high ground over nothing.  <br>
<br>
Even if you hate the current administration, to believe that they would partake in any operation on this grand of scale and with this much political kharma at stake without having all thier ducks in a row is just not something you would expect to be going on here.  I can't say I blame you for your conclusions but as you are so quick to point out all we have are conclusions until definative proof is shown.<br>
<br>
And Sashanna there is nothing to say they couldn't have just destroyed it or moved it to another country already.  I wouldn't be surprised either way, weather the US finds it or not, the only thing that would surprise me is if it didn't actually exist.  However those are very closely guarded secrets that many of its keepers may either never tell or have already taken to the grave with them.<br>
<br>
Make up your own mind about it...I think it's obvious that there are 2 different points of view...and in my mind a 'smoking gun', while being an important part of repairing UN relations is also something that I don't think is all that important.  <br>
<br>
There is one less tyrannical dictator bending the will of his own people out there...and there is a fine example that the US is going to go after any government that sponsors terrorism (Al-Qieda or any other kind). And that is good enough for me.<br>
<br>
Terrorism is shit.  Funny how in the US war on terrorists half of these fuckers side with the Terrorists.  What a bunch of idiots.<br>
<br>
Hiding behind UN regulations and cowering in fear of the consequences of going after any entity that supports terrorism is exactly what has made it as powerful as it is today.  And the only way to beat it is to take those 2 factors out of the equasion. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95106">My Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1655.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1655.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1655.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1655.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1655.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showMessageRange?topicID=1655.topic&start=121&stop=131>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=1655.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=1655.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=1655.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.threadControl?topicID=1655.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1655.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/fthetribunaldotorgfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1655.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub101.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm1">General Discussion<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm10">Announcements<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm45">The Retirement Home<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm5">The Pawn Shop<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm16">Good Times!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm44">So...where ya from?<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm17">Vox/Naggy Scheduling<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm15">The Dark Traveller's Tavern<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm12">Flameboard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm36">Reality Sinks In<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm9">Other Games<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm41">Humor and Links<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm39">Gnomeball!<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm38">The Best and Worst of The Tribunal<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm34">Poll Archive<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm18">Artists of Norrath<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm6">Screenshots<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm7">Signatures and Tests<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm43">UI Customizations<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm19">Bard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm37">Beastlord<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm20">Cleric<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm21">Druid<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm22">Enchanter<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm23">Magician<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm24">Monk<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm25">Necromancer<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm26">Paladin<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm27">Ranger<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm28">Rogue<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm29">Shadowknight<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm30">Shaman<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm31">Warrior<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm32">Wizard<option value="thetribunaldotorgfrm3">Comments for the Admins</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg>TheTribunal.org</a><font color=#FFFFFF> -
