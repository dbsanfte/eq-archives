<br>
All in all... I don't see the point in a few people from different guilds facing off with your one guild.  Sure... we could be defenders and sure... we could very well be slaughtered but what is the point since we can't fight as one?  <br>
<br>
Disbanding and forming one guild really isn't a good option for this, its been tried before on Fennin Ro and it gets messy.  Its alot hearder without alts to make the 'War' guild too.  As much as I would love to be in an ongoing little war story of some sort, its difficult without preperation and consideration for what game mechanics we have.<br>
<br>
I am not talking for the Sisters as a guild, this is just from me.  I have some experience in guild wars and multi guild wars from Fennin Ro.  Its a pain but if done well, they can be alot of fun.  Simply attacking a city and expecting people to come defend it is a real pain and usually leads to guard trains and people getting upset in RP.  Several reasons for this and the big one is there is really no real victory and the guards tend to kill those they don't like.  What we did was setup objectives between guilds that followed a story line.  Taking cities was not really an option... we would 'Raid' a city in order to achieve a certain goal.  Like retrieve a person that is held captive there, or kill a certain person.  Wholesale slaughter was not really a good goal because reality is the city is still there and therefore the RP is difficult... cause well, the city is really still there.<br>
<br>
ie.  This is an example conflict from Fennin Ro.  House Devir was trying to apprehend a Sister from PMS (an all Femal guild similar to CoS called Pretentious Malevolent Sisters).  We staged this in Lavastorm.  PMS was hiding their Sister in the Temple of Ro.  Their job was to get her to the Nek/LS zone line, our job was to of course kill her.  House Devir started at the zone line and PMS started at the Temple entrance.  We battled in the middle and had little strategies that we were trying to uise to catch her.  They were trying to keep all of us busy while sneaking her through using whatever means they had.  No porting was allowed.  We got her though, but it was really by accident.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   End result was we took her as a prisoner and so the story progressed to where PMS had to go another route to retrieve their Sister.  I think it was a one on one battle in the 3rd Circle... they sent in someone to battle the 'guard' that was watching over her.  Then they had to sneak her out of Neriak.  That was actually a great battle fought behind the necromancers Guild between a Paladin and a ShadowKnight.<br>
<br>
Ok... this went on longer than I meant it to.  I have lots of little conflict stories that we went through and how we did it.  I wish we had the ability to make an alliance and then go to war.<br>
<br>
I would be happy to put something together, like I said a good story with a good conflict is great fun.<br>

You seem to have a certain disrespect for life.  Perhaps someday I'll find some time in my busy schedule to show you how important Tunare's gift is.  As I told you before, the Circle is not involved in your idiocy.  Keep your letters to yourself. <p><p><font face="Calisto MT"><img border="0" src="http://www.hyperjump.net/lunap2000/llylewen2.jpg" align="left" width="104" height="104"></font><font face="Invitation" size="4">Llylewen
